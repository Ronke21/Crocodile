<text>__notoc__
Živa, Zhiva () is a mother goddess of one of the tribes belonging to the Obodritic confederation of the Polabian Slavs. The goddess so appears only in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; of Helmold of Bozov. He described the strengthening of the pagan cult during the reign of Niklot:

As the tribe&#x27;s main gord was Ratzeburg, Živa, in one copy of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, is called &quot;Goddess of Ratzeburg&quot; ().

In copies of the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, the name is noted as: (Copenhagen copy), (Lübeck), (Vienna), (Szczecin). The Copenhagen, Lübeck and Szczecin manuscripts indicate that the name contained the grapheme ⟨w⟩ ([v]); the Szczecin notation was created as a result of frequent ⟨u⟩ → ⟨n⟩ alternation and reflected the form &quot;*Syuua&quot;, while the double ⟨u⟩ = ⟨w⟩, which indicates the original form (&quot;*Syva&quot;). The Viennese transcript is the most distorted in relation to the original.

Scholars agree on the etymology of this theonym. It is read as the Slavic &quot;*Živa&quot;, from Slavic feminine adjective &quot;alive, live, living&quot;. &quot;Živa&quot; is also a personal name attested in several Slavic languages, e.g. the Old Polabian personal name &quot;*Živa&quot; (Latin: , 1336), the Old Polish surname &quot;Żywa&quot; (Latin: , , , ), the Serbo-Croatian given name , the Bulgarian , and others. Originally, therefore, this theonym was a given name, which then became an epithet of an unknown goddess, whose characteristics would have to be related to the meaning of the name; this theonym can be understood as a wishing name, e.g., &quot;may she be alive and live long&quot;, or a characterizing name, e.g., &quot;she who is alive&quot;. Vyacheslav Ivanov i Vladimir Toporov considered Živa to be an epithet of the goddess Mokosh (which was preserved in the names of the Polabians after Christianization).

<text>Forstmann, Little &amp; Company was an American private equity firm, specializing in leveraged buyouts (LBOs). At its peak in the late 1990s, Forstmann Little was among the largest private equity firms globally. Ultimately, the firm would suffer from the bursting of the internet and telecom bubbles, having invested heavily in technology and telecommunications companies. Following the death of the last surviving founder, Theodore Forstmann, in 2011, the firm was dissolved and its assets sold off. It closed in May 2014.

==History==

Ted Forstmann was a golfing partner of Derald Ruttenberg at the Deepdale Country Club on Long Island. He arranged for Ruttenberg to meet Henry Kravis and Jerry Kohlberg of the start-up Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Kravis and Kohlberg proposed what they called a leveraged buyout. After the two had left, Ruttenberg suggested that Forstmann could do the same himself. Ruttenberg arranged funding for Forstmann, who launched Forstmann Little &amp; Company in 1978.
The company was founded by brothers Ted and Nick Forstmann, and Brian Little. With the deaths of Brian Little and Nicholas Forstmann in 2000 and 2001, respectively, Ted Forstmann was the chief partner. A third brother, J. Anthony Forstmann, is a limited partner in the firm.

Between its inception in 1978 to its 2014 closing, the firm made more than 30 acquisitions and significant investments returning over $14 billion in profit for its investors.

Successful acquisitions included Gulfstream Aerospace, Topps Playing Cards, Dr Pepper, Stanadyne, and General Instrument. The company was usually successful in making a profit on such purchases, selling Gulfstream to General Dynamics, and General Instrument to Motorola. In the case of Gulfstream, Ted Forstmann took direct control of the financially ailing company&#x27;s day-to-day operations to improve the company&#x27;s attractiveness to a potential acquirer.

The company has also had some flops, such as McLeodUSA and XO Communications. In 2002, the state of Connecticut sued Forstmann, Little &amp; Company to recover $125 million in losses associated with investments in these two telecom companies, citing negligence and breach of contract. While Forstmann settled the case for $15 million, the suit was considered a landmark, launching a series of similar actions between private equity fund managers and public entity investors.

One prominent episode in the life of the company was the 1988 bidding war for RJR Nabisco. Forstmann Little offered to acquire RJR Nabisco, but the management (chiefly F. Ross Johnson) instead chose Shearson Lehman Hutton. In the end, the board of directors chose Forstmann Little&#x27;s arch-rival, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The episode was popularized in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;.

Other headline transactions the firm participated in include Revlon (1985), which resulted in the so-called Revlon Duty, and Citadel Broadcasting, of which Forstmann Little owns 27%, following a merger with ABC Radio in 2006. In 2004, Forstmann Little acquired IMG in a $750 million deal, and in 2005 bought 24 Hour Fitness for $1.6 billion.

== Dissolution ==
In 2011, Theodore Forstmann, the last surviving founder, died of brain cancer. The law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld dissolved the firm by selling off its assets. IMG was sold in 2013 for $2.3 billion to William Morris Endeavor. The last asset to be sold was 24 Hour Fitness, which was purchased for $2 billion by AEA Investors.

<doc id="952833" wikidata="Q2320780" url="?curid=952833" title="Elin Nordegren">
<text>Elin Maria Pernilla Nordegren (; born 1 January 1980) is a Swedish former model and nanny. She was married to professional golfer Tiger Woods from 2004 until their divorce in 2010.

== Early life and education ==
Nordegren was born in Stockholm. Her mother, politician Barbro Holmberg, is the former Swedish migration and asylum policy minister as well as the former Governor of Gävleborg County. Her father, Thomas Nordegren, is a radio journalist who has served as a bureau chief in Washington, D.C. She has an elder brother, Axel, and a twin sister Josefin Nordegren. Her parents divorced when she was seven years old. Nordegren and her sister had summer jobs as cashiers in supermarkets to finance their studies. The two moved to Germany with their father in 1997 for a year, studying English and German in eleventh grade at John F. Kennedy School, Berlin. Elin started modeling in 2000, and appeared on the cover of &quot;Cafe Sport&quot; magazine in the summer of 2000.

In May 2014, Nordegren graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, with a degree in psychology, receiving the outstanding senior award. She gave the commencement address at the graduation ceremony.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage and family ===
Nordegren took a job in Champagne, a Stockholm clothing store, where she met Mia Parnevik, wife of Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who hired Nordegren as the au pair to their children, the job requiring her to move full-time to the U.S. Tiger Woods was introduced to her during the 2001 Open Championship. For the previous year, Woods had asked to be introduced to Nordegren, who was seeing someone else at the time. &quot;She had no interest in Tiger and he was OK with that,&quot; Mia Parnevik said. &quot;There was a big line of single golfers wanting to meet her. They were gaga over her.&quot; At the time, she had hopes of becoming a child psychologist. In November 2003, Woods and Nordegren attended the Presidents Cup tournament in South Africa and became officially engaged when Woods proposed at the luxury Shamwari Game Reserve.

They were married in October 2004, by the 19th hole of the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados. Woods rented the entire complex for a week, including three golf courses and 110 rooms, costing almost 

Nude photographs purporting to be of Nordegren began circulating on the Internet. Despite them being fakes, Irish magazine &quot;The Dubliner&quot; published the nude photographs and stated they were of Nordegren. On 16 November 2006, Nordegren filed a libel suit against &quot;The Dubliner&quot;. Nordegren won €125,000, and &quot;The Dubliner&quot; was required to publish a lengthy apology in a variety of venues.

In 2007, Woods announced the birth of the couple&#x27;s daughter, Sam Alexis, a day after finishing second in the U.S. Open. On 2 September 2008, Woods announced they were expecting another child in late winter. Nordegren gave birth to a boy, Charlie Axel, in 2009.

=== Divorce ===
In December 2009, her marriage to Woods was the subject of extensive media coverage after Woods admitted to infidelity, which had been revealed following his single-vehicle accident near the family&#x27;s Florida home. After Woods&#x27; infidelity was revealed, Jesper Parnevik was quoted as having said, &quot;I&#x27;m kind of filled with sorrow for Elin since me and my wife are at fault for hooking her up with him, and we probably thought he was a better guy than he is.&quot; Woods announced he would take an &quot;indefinite break&quot; from golf to work on his marriage. These efforts were unsuccessful, however, as Nordegren and Woods finalized their divorce in the Bay County Circuit Court in Panama City, Florida, on 23 August 2010. Nordegren&#x27;s legal team included her sister, Josefin (who is licensed to practice law in England and Sweden) and several of Josefin&#x27;s U.S. colleagues at international law firm McGuireWoods.

Using the $100 million she received from her divorce from Woods, she purchased a $12 million Florida mansion built in the 1920s. She had the entire structure demolished after an architect advised that it made better sense to start over than to try bringing the home up to current hurricane safety codes. Before demolishing the home in December 2011, she allowed Habitat for Humanity to come into the home for four weeks and salvage anything they found of value. The contents of the estate were auctioned at a Habitat for Humanity warehouse, including a fountain with water spouting out of three lions&#x27; mouths, five refrigerators, temperature-controlled wine coolers, and other furniture.

=== Later relationships ===
In 2011, Nordegren was in a relationship with American businessman Jamie Dingman, which lasted less than a year. She dated American entrepreneur Chris Cline from 2013 to 2017.

In June 2019, it was announced that Nordegren was expecting her first child with former National Football League player Jordan Cameron. Nordegren gave birth to a son, Arthur, in October 2019. In December 2022, Nordegren gave birth to their second child, reportedly a daughter. The couple also has a third child together.

<doc id="952838" wikidata="Q969652" url="?curid=952838" title="Kosovo Campaign Medal">
<text>The Kosovo Campaign Medal (KCM) was a military award of the United States Armed Forces established by of President Bill Clinton on May 3, 2000. The medal recognizes military service performed in Kosovo from March 24, 1999 through December 31, 2013.

==History==
The following are authorized Kosovo Operations and task forces, with respective inclusive dates, eligible for the KCM:
=== Kosovo Air Campaign ===

March 24, 1999 – June 10, 1999. The area of operations for this campaign included the total land area and air space of Yugoslavia (including Kosovo), Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, and Slovenia; and the waters and air space of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea north of the 39th North Latitude. Note: Secretary of Defense William Cohen approved award of the Kosovo Campaign Medal to the following Navy vessels for participation in this campaign as an exception to the 30 consecutive day rule: &quot;USS &quot;Norfolk&quot;; USS &quot;Miami&quot;, USS &quot;Boise&quot;; USS &quot;Albuquerque&quot;, USS &quot;Nicholson&quot;, USS &quot;Philippine Sea&quot;, USS &quot;Gonzalez&quot;, and USS Theodore Roosevelt
=== Kosovo Defense Campaign ===
June 11, 1999 – 31 December 2013. The area of operations includes the total land area and air space of Serbia (including Kosovo), Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, and the waters and air space of the Adriatic Sea within 12 nautical miles of the Montenegro, Albania, and Croatia coastlines south of 42 degrees and 52 minutes North Latitude.

==Criteria==
Service members must be bona fide members of a unit participating in, or be engaged in direct support of, the operation for 30 consecutive days in the area of operations or for 60 non-consecutive days provided this support involves entering the area of operations or meets one of the following criteria:

*Be engaged in actual combat, or duty that is equally as hazardous as combat duty, during the operation with armed opposition, regardless of time in the area of operations;
*While participating in the operation, regardless of time, is wounded or injured and requires medical evacuation from the area of operations.
*While participating as a regularly assigned aircrew member flying sorties into, out of, within, or over the area of operations in direct support of the military operations.
==Campaign phases and devices==

===Kosovo Campaign Medal campaign periods===

Any one of the two campaigns 

Both campaigns 

Service stars are awarded for participation in either the Air Campaign or the Defense Campaign. Two service stars may be awarded provided that two separate tours, exceeding the 30/60 day requirement, were performed in both the Defense and Air Campaigns. The Kosovo Campaign Medal is always awarded with at least one service star. The Fleet Marine Force combat operation insignia is also authorized for certain sailors.

==Appearance==

=== Obverse ===
In the center of a bronze medallion, two mountains with a pass between them rest in front of a fertile valley and atop a wreath composed of two stylized sheaves of wheat. Behind the mountains a rising sun, and superimposed over the sun&#x27;s rays are the words, in two lines, KOSOVO CAMPAIGN. The stylized wreath of grain reflects the agricultural character of the area and its economy and symbolizes basic human rights while high-lighting the desire of all for peace, safety and prosperity. The rocky terrain, fertile valley, and mountain pass refer to the Dinartic Alps and the campaign&#x27;s theater of operations. The sunrise denotes the dawning of a new age of unity and hope, the right to forge a future of freedom, progress, and harmony; thus fulfilling the goal of the Alliance.

=== Reverse ===
In the center of a bronze medallion, the outline of a map of the Yugoslavian Province of Kosovo. Beneath the map is a three-pointed star. In a circle surrounding the map and star are the words IN DEFENSE OF HUMANITY. The outline of the Province of Kosovo denotes the area of conflict, and is combined with the NATO star, the highlighted cardinal points of the compass, signifying the Alliance participants who stabilized the region and provided massive relief. The inscription reinforces the objective of the military action conducted during the campaign.

=== Ribbon ===
The ribbon consists of red, white, and blue pinstripes of equal width in the center; the ribbon to the wearer&#x27;s right is dark blue and abuts to the red pinstripe; the ribbon to the wearer&#x27;s left is red, and abuts to the blue pinstripe. The red, white, and blue were suggested by the NATO Alliance&#x27;s colors, and the red, white, and blue pinstripes represent the colors of the United States flag.

==Notes==

=== Combat Zones ===
Combat zones are designated by an Executive Order from the President as areas in which the U.S. Armed Forces are engaging or have engaged in combat. There are currently three such combat zones (including the airspace above each):Arabian Peninsula Areas, beginning Jan. 17, 1991—the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman, the part of the Arabian Sea north of 10° North latitude and west of 68° East longitude, the Gulf of Aden, and the countries of Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Kosovo area, beginning Mar. 24, 1999—Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro), Albania, the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea north of the 39th Parallel.

Public Law 104-117 designates three parts of the former Yugoslavia as a Qualified Hazardous Duty Area, to be treated as if it were a combat zone, beginning Nov. 21, 1995—Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 24, 2013 – The Defense Department has announced the transition of the Kosovo Campaign Medal to the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, effective Jan. 1, 2014.

In a Sept. 19 memorandum, Acting Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness Jessica L. Wright stated that the KCM recognized the significant contributions of U.S. military personnel in support of Operation Joint Guardian since 1999 as part of the NATO-led Kosovo Force. “The contributions of U.S. military personnel have been integral to ending open hostilities and to reducing ethnic tensions, allowing for the dramatic reduction of force levels over the past decade,” Wright noted.

As smaller contingencies of U.S. forces continue to support Operation Joint Guardian and NATO headquarters in Sarajevo, the AFEM will accordingly recognize that support of operations in the Balkans, the memo states.

The AFEM area of eligibility mirrors that of the KCM, Wright explained, with the addition of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Hungary. The eligible area also encompasses Serbian land and airspace including Vojvodina, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, and U.S. Naval vessels operating in the Adriatic Sea. The Department of Defense Manual 1348.33, Volume 2, “Manual of Military Decorations and Awards” contains specific eligibility criteria.

<text>Kovar (trademark of CRS Holdings, inc., Delaware) is a nickel–cobalt ferrous alloy compositionally identical to Fernico 1, designed to have substantially the same thermal expansion characteristics as borosilicate glass (≈ between , to ≈ at 800 °C) to allow a tight mechanical joint between the two materials over a range of temperatures. It finds application in glass-to-metal seals in scientific apparatus, and conductors entering glass envelopes of electronic parts such as vacuum tubes (valves), X-ray and microwave tubes and some lightbulbs. 

Kovar was invented to meet the need for a reliable glass-to-metal seal, which is required in electronic devices such as light bulbs, vacuum tubes, cathode-ray tubes, and in vacuum systems in chemistry and other scientific research. Most metals cannot seal to glass because their coefficient of thermal expansion is not the same as glass; as the joint cools after fabrication the stresses due to the different expansion rates of the glass and metal cause the joint to crack.

Kovar not only has thermal expansion similar to glass, but its nonlinear thermal expansion curve can often be made to match a glass, thus allowing the joint to tolerate a wide temperature range. Chemically, it bonds to glass via the intermediate oxide layer of nickel(II) oxide and cobalt(II) oxide. The proportion of iron oxide is low due to its reduction by cobalt. The bond strength is highly dependent on the oxide layer thickness and character.[4][6] The presence of cobalt makes the oxide layer easier to melt and dissolve in the molten glass. A grey, grey-blue or grey-brown color indicates a good seal. A metallic color indicates lack of oxide, while black color indicates overly oxidized metal, in both cases leading to a weak joint.[2] 

The name Kovar is often used as a general term for Fe–Ni alloys with these particular thermal expansion properties. The related particular Fe–Ni alloy Invar exhibits minimum thermal expansion.

<doc id="952842" wikidata="Q936559" url="?curid=952842" title="Principle of compositionality">
<text>In semantics, mathematical logic and related disciplines, the principle of compositionality is the principle that the meaning of a complex expression is determined by the meanings of its constituent expressions and the rules used to combine them. The principle is also called Frege&#x27;s principle, because Gottlob Frege is widely credited for the first modern formulation of it. However, the principle has never been explicitly stated by Frege, and arguably it was already assumed by George Boole decades before Frege&#x27;s work.

The principle of compositionality (also known as semantic compositionalism) is highly debated in linguistics. Among its most challenging problems there are the issues of contextuality, the non-compositionality of idiomatic expressions, and the non-compositionality of quotations.

== History ==
Discussion of compositionality started to appear at the beginning of the 19th century, during which it was debated whether what was most fundamental in language was compositionality or contextuality, and compositionality was usually preferred. Gottlob Frege never adhered to the principle of compositionality as it is known today (Frege endorsed the context principle instead), and the first to explicitly formulate it was Rudolf Carnap in 1947.

==Overview==
A common formulation of the principle of compositionality comes from Barbara Partee, stating: &quot;The meaning of a compound expression is a function of the meanings of its parts and of the way they are syntactically combined.&quot;

It is possible to distinguish different levels of compositionality. Strong compositionality refers to compound expressions that are determined by the meaning of its &quot;immediate&quot; parts and a top-level syntactic function that describes their combination. Weak compositionality refers to compound expressions that are determined by the meaning of its parts as well as their complete syntactic combination. However, there can also be further gradations in between these two extremes. This is possible, if one not only allows the meaning of immediate parts but also the meaning of the second-highest parts (third-highest parts, fourth-highest parts, etc.) together with functions that describes their respective combinations.

On a sentence level, the principle claims that what remains if one removes the lexical parts of a meaningful sentence, are the rules of composition. The sentence &quot;Socrates was a man&quot;, for example, becomes &quot;S was a M&quot; once the meaningful lexical items—&quot;Socrates&quot; and &quot;man&quot;—are taken away. The task of finding the rules of composition, then becomes a matter of describing what the connection between S and M is.

Among the most prominent linguistic problems that challenge the principle of compositionality are the issues of contextuality, the non compositionality of idiomatic expressions, and the non compositionality of quotations.

It is frequently taken to mean that every operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the syntactic operation. As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by Donald Davidson, to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the T-schema with an operator in the semantics that specifies how the meaning of the whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of Montague grammar), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a homomorphism between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.

The principle of compositionality also exists in a similar form in the compositionality of programming languages.

== Critiques ==
The principle of compositionality has been the subject of intense debate. Indeed, there is no general agreement as to how the principle is to be interpreted, although there have been several attempts to provide formal definitions of it.

Scholars are also divided as to whether the principle should be regarded as a factual claim, open to empirical testing; an analytic truth, obvious from the nature of language and meaning; or a methodological principle to guide the development of theories of syntax and semantics. The Principle of Compositionality has been attacked in all three spheres, although so far none of the criticisms brought against it have been generally regarded as compelling. Most proponents of the principle, however, make certain exceptions for idiomatic expressions in natural language.

The principle of compositionality usually holds when only syntactic factors play in the increased complexity of sentence processing, while it becomes more problematic and questionable when the complexity increase is due to sentence or discourse context, semantic memory, or sensory cues. Among the problematic phenomena for traditional theories of compositionality is that of logical metonymy, which has been studied at least since the mid 1990s by linguists James Pustejovsky and Ray Jackendoff. Logical metonymies are sentences like &quot;John began the book&quot;, where the verb &quot;to begin&quot; requires (subcategorizes) an event as its argument, but in a logical metonymy an object (i.e. &quot;the book&quot;) is found instead, and this forces to interpret the sentence by inferring an implicit event (&quot;reading&quot;, &quot;writing&quot;, or other prototypical actions performed on a book). The problem for compositionality is that the meaning of reading or writing is not present in the words of the sentence, neither in &quot;begin&quot; nor in &quot;book&quot;.

Further, in the context of the philosophy of language, the principle of compositionality does not explain all of meaning. For example, you cannot infer sarcasm purely on the basis of words and their composition, yet a phrase used sarcastically means something completely different from the same phrase uttered straightforwardly. Thus, some theorists argue that the principle has to be revised to take into account linguistic and extralinguistic context, which includes the tone of voice used, common ground between the speakers, the intentions of the speaker, and so on.

<text>Rear Admiral Lewis Ashfield Kimberly (April 22, 1830 – January 28, 1902) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War and the years following.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Kimberly was born in Troy, New York, and was appointed a midshipman on 8 December 1846. He served aboard the sloop in the Africa Squadron in 1847–50, then in the Pacific aboard the frigate during 1850–52, receiving promotion to passed midshipman on June 8, 1852. He then returned to African waters, serving in the sloops and in 1853–56, and was promoted to master and lieutenant on September 15 and 16, 1855. Kimberly spent some time stationed at the Boston Navy Yard, and then served aboard the sloop in the East India Squadron between July 1857 and April 1860, before joining the newly commissioned steam sloop which sailed for the Mediterranean in October 1860, finally returning to the United States in July 1861 after the outbreak of the Civil War.

Between 1856 and 1860, he kept a notebook of doodles, sketches, and watercolors. Themes included geometric designs, architectural drawings, caricatures, cipher codes, and sketches of his colleagues. In 2008, the USS Constitution Museum acquired it.

===Civil War service===
In 1861–62 Kimberly served aboard the frigate in the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, taking part in the Mississippi River operations at Port Hudson, Grand Gulf, and Vicksburg, and receiving promotion to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862. In 1863–64 he served as the executive officer of the steam sloop , seeing action at the Battle of Mobile Bay, after which he was warmly commended for his gallant and efficient service. After the war, he joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

===Post-war commands===
From May 1865 Kimberly served aboard the steam frigate , the flagship of the European Squadron, receiving promotion to commander on July 25, 1866, and returning the United States in September 1867. He commanded the receiving ship at New York in 1867–70, then the screw sloop on the Asiatic Station in 1870–72, taking part in the Korean expedition in May–July 1871, serving as the commander of the landing forces. He then commanded the monitor along the east coast in 1873–74.

Kimberly was promoted to captain on October 3, 1874, and commanded the sloop on the South Atlantic Station in 1875–76, and the screw sloop in the Pacific in 1877–78. During the early 1880s Kimberly served at the New York Navy Yard, and was the President of the Examining and Retiring Board in 1883–85, gaining promotion to commodore on September 27, 1884. He was appointed Commandant of the Boston Navy Yard in 1885, and attained the rank of rear admiral on January 26, 1887. He was then appointed the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Squadron. In March 1889, during the Samoan crisis, his flagship was struck by a violent cyclone while at harbor at Apia. Guiding his men with the words, &quot;If we go down, let us do so with our flag flying,&quot; Kimberly skillfully beached his flagship, losing only one man in the raging storm that wrecked &quot;Trenton&quot;. Following his return to the United States in January 1890, Kimberly was appointed President of the Board of Inspection and Survey; holding the post until his retirement on April 2, 1892.

Rear Admiral Kimberly died on January 28, 1902, in West Newton, Massachusetts.

==Namesakes==
Two U.S. Navy destroyers have been named USS &quot;Kimberly&quot; his honor; (1918–1939) and (1943–1967).

<doc id="952858" wikidata="Q3176324" url="?curid=952858" title="Closed ecological system">
<text>Closed ecological systems or contained ecological systems (CES) are ecosystems that do not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system.

The term is most often used to describe small, man-made ecosystems. Such systems can potentially serve as a life-support system or space habitats.

In a closed ecological system, any waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. If the purpose is to maintain a life form, such as a mouse or a human, waste products such as carbon dioxide, feces and urine must eventually be converted into oxygen, food, and water.

A closed ecological system must contain at least one autotrophic organism. While both chemotrophic and phototrophic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on an autotroph such as green algae.

== Examples ==

A closed ecological system for an entire planet is called an ecosphere.

Man-made closed ecological systems which were created to sustain human life include Biosphere 2, MELiSSA, and the BIOS-1, BIOS-2, and BIOS-3 projects.

Bottle gardens and aquarium ecospheres are partially or fully enclosed glass containers that are self-sustaining closed ecosystems that can be made or purchased. They can include tiny shrimp, algae, gravel, decorative shells, and &quot;Gorgonia&quot;.

==In fiction==

Closed ecological systems are commonly featured in fiction and particularly in science fiction. These include domed cities, space stations and habitats on foreign planets or asteroids, cylindrical habitats (e.g. O&#x27;Neill cylinders), Dyson Spheres and so on.

<doc id="952865" wikidata="Q444900" url="?curid=952865" title="Chris Ferguson">
<text>Christopher Philip Ferguson (born April 11, 1963) is an American professional poker player. He has won six World Series of Poker events, including the 2000 WSOP Main Event, and the 2008 NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship. Ferguson is a computer scientist by training and education.

On September 20, 2011, the U.S. Justice Department filed a motion to amend a civil complaint, with the belief that Ferguson and three other directors for the popular poker client Full Tilt Poker were running a Ponzi scheme that paid out $444 million of customer money to themselves and the firm&#x27;s owners.

==Early life and education==
Ferguson was born in Los Angeles, California. Both Ferguson&#x27;s parents have doctoral degrees in mathematics and his father, Thomas S. Ferguson, teaches game theory and theoretical probability at UCLA.

Ferguson attended UCLA, where he earned a Ph.D. in computer science (focusing on virtual network algorithms) in 1999 after five years as an undergraduate and 13 years as a graduate student. His Ph.D. advisor was Leonard Kleinrock. While at UCLA Ferguson appeared on the Ricky Jay Television Special &quot;Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women&quot; as an assistant.

==Poker career==
Ferguson began playing poker at the age of 10. In college, he honed his skill on IRC poker playing online for play money in chat rooms. In 1994, he began playing in tournaments in California and in 1995, he entered his first World Series of Poker. He is a relatively quiet player who often adopts a characteristic motionless pose to avoid providing information to his opponents. He adopted his trademark wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses consciously, to point towards a table image that does not display outright the fact that he was a college student. Ferguson is nicknamed &quot;Jesus&quot; because of his trademark long brown hair and beard. His style is highly mathematical, using a strong knowledge of game theory and developing computer simulations to improve his understanding of the game.

In the 2000 WSOP Ferguson won his first bracelet in the $2,500 Seven-Card Stud event for $151,000. He followed this up by defeating T. J. Cloutier heads-up at the Main Event to win the $1.5 million prize. In 2004, he earned $120,000 in the Main Event for his 26th-place finish (out of 2,576 players).

Ferguson finished runner-up to Phil Hellmuth in the 2005 National Heads-Up Poker Championship. He made the finals again in 2006, but again finished second, this time to Ted Forrest. In 2008, he made the finals for the third time, this time defeating Andy Bloch and winning the title.

At the 2017 WSOP, Ferguson set a record with 23 cashes. He also won his sixth bracelet, and first in 14 years, at the WSOP Europe in the €1,650 Pot Limit Omaha Hi-Lo 8 or Better event. With these results Ferguson won the WSOP Player of the Year award.

As of September 2020, his total live tournament winnings exceed $9,500,000. His 168 WSOP cashes account for over $6,800,000 of those winnings.

=== World Series of Poker bracelets ===


In addition to his six bracelets, Ferguson was the first player to have won three World Series of Poker Circuit rings.

== Full Tilt Poker scandal ==

In 2004, Ferguson co-founded the online poker site Full Tilt Poker. On September 20, 2011, the United States Department of Justice amended an existing civil complaint against Full Tilt Poker, alleging that directors Chris Ferguson, Howard Lederer, and Rafe Furst &quot;lined their own pockets with funds picked from the pockets of their most loyal customers while blithely lying to both players and the public alike about the safety and security of the money deposited.&quot; A lawyer for Ferguson denied the allegations, suggesting that the issues may have been the result of mismanagement not malice. While the legality of online poker remains controversial, Ferguson&#x27;s case was dismissed on February 19, 2013.

==Personal life==
Ferguson&#x27;s interests include being president of a swing dancing club at UCLA, as well as his ability to throw playing cards fast enough to cut through bananas, carrots and even melons. His card throwing ability was showcased on a side segment called ‘The Nuts’ on the ESPN broadcast of the World Series of Poker.

<doc id="952869" wikidata="Q2777608" url="?curid=952869" title="The Van Beuren Corporation">
<text>The Van Beuren Corporation was a New York City-based animation studio that produced theatrical cartoons as well as live-action short-subjects from the 1920s to 1936.

== History ==
In 1920, the Keith-Albee organization formed Fables Pictures for the production of the Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables cartoon series with Paul Terry, who himself owned 10 percent of the studio. Producer Amedee J. Van Beuren bought out the studio in 1928, retaining Terry and renaming the business after its new owner. Van Beuren released Terry&#x27;s first sound cartoon &quot;Dinner Time&quot; (1928) (a month before Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;) through Pathé Exchange, which later became part of RKO Pictures. Terry ran the animation studio while Van Beuren focused on other parts of the business. In 1929, Terry quit to start his own Terrytoons studio and John Foster took over the animation department.

Van Beuren released his films through RKO Radio Pictures. The early sound Van Beuren cartoons are almost identical to the late silent cartoons: highly visual, with little dialogue and occasional sound effects. Bandleaders Gene Rodemich and Winston Sharples supervised the music. The company&#x27;s main cartoon characters were &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, a tall-and-short pair, usually vagrants who attempted various occupations. They share no relation to MGM&#x27;s more successful Tom and Jerry, a cat and mouse, and the older series has been renamed &quot;Van Beuren&#x27;s Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Dick and Larry&quot; in various future incarnations. Van Beuren was keenly aware that successful cartoons often featured animated &quot;stars&quot;, and urged his staff to come up with new ideas for characters. Cubby, a mischievous little bear, resulted.

In 1932, Van Beuren planned to release a series of wild-animal shorts featuring celebrity explorer Frank Buck. RKO executives were so impressed by these Van Beuren shorts that they decided to combine them into a feature film, &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot;. This was a very successful business move, but it left both Van Beuren and RKO with a void in their short-subject schedule. Van Beuren, forced to act quickly, found an existing series of two-reel comedies: Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s 12 productions for the Mutual film company, produced in 1916-17. Van Beuren paid $10,000 each for the shorts, and assigned his animation department to create new music and sound effects for the silent films. Bandleader Gene Rodemich and Rodemich&#x27;s assistant and successor Winston Sharples assembled new scores. RKO released the Van Beuren Chaplins in 1933–34. Chaplin did not own these films; author Michael J. Hayde discloses that Chaplin had declined several opportunities to purchase them.

The Van Beuren Corporation acquired and produced live-action features such as &quot;Adventure Girl&quot; (1934) and two more Frank Buck safaris, &quot;Wild Cargo&quot; (1934) and &quot;Frank Buck&#x27;s Fang and Claw&quot; (1935). Other Van Beuren live-action productions included a &quot;Van Beuren Vagabond&quot; travelogue series, a series of novelty shorts narrated by the radio comedy team Easy Aces (Goodman Ace and Jane Ace) and musical comedy shorts featuring Bert Lahr, Shemp Howard, among others.

Van Beuren remained unsatisfied, and agreed to license the popular comic-strip character &quot;The Little King&quot; and the radio comedy act, Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy to adapt into animated cartoons. Neither series was successful. Van Beuren then hired Walt Disney director Burt Gillett and animator Tom Palmer to create a new series of color cartoons. These &quot;Rainbow Parade&quot; cartoons featured established characters: Felix the Cat, Parrotville Parrots, Molly Moo-Cow, and the Toonerville Folks.

== Closure ==
These full-color Van Beuren efforts were well received, and Van Beuren had finally succeeded in sponsoring a popular cartoon series, but RKO later entered into a deal to distribute new color cartoons produced by industry leader Walt Disney. RKO, no longer needing Van Beuren&#x27;s cartoons, abandoned the Rainbow Parade shorts.

Amedee J. Van Beuren fell ill during this time. In July 1938, he had a stroke that would eventually lead to his death on November 12 of the same year by heart attack.

During his recovery from his stroke, Van Beuren closed his studio rather than accept unionization that had caused the studio problems in 1935.

The Van Beuren library was sold to various television, reissue, and home-movie distributors in the 1940s and 1950s, including Unity Pictures, Walter Gutlohn/Library Films, Commonwealth Pictures, and Official Films. The library eventually lapsed into the public domain.

<text>The Birmingham Metropolitan Area is an urban agglomeration located in the West Midlands region of England with a population of around 4.3 million people, making it the second largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. It comprises the three cities (Birmingham, Coventry, Wolverhampton) and four metropolitan boroughs (Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall) which make up the Metropolitan county of the West Midlands, along with its commuter zones, which extend into the neighbouring district authorities of Bromsgrove and Redditch in Worcestershire; Cannock Chase, Lichfield, South Staffordshire and Tamworth in Staffordshire; and all five district authorities of Warwickshire, including the towns of Bedworth, Coleshill, Nuneaton, Royal Leamington Spa, and Warwick itself.

A number of sizeable settlements fall outside the morphological boundaries of the Birmingham Metropolitan Area but still form part of its economic and infrastructural hinterland. Amongst these, the cathedral city of Lichfield, the towns of Cannock, Hednesford and Rugeley in Staffordshire, Rugby and Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, and Kidderminster in the Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire.

Like other regional conurbations in the United Kingdom, the Birmingham Metropolitan Area is polycentric, with several primary urban areas and satellite towns overlaying traditional market towns and civil parishes, separated by areas of protected green space. This is reflected in a diverse urban landscape characterised by examples of Medieval, Tudor, Jacobean, English Baroque, Georgian, Victorian, Edwardian, Modern, Postmodern and Contemporary architecture.

The metro area acts as a major international commercial centre and an important transport, retail, events and conference hub. Birmingham New Street railway station is the busiest railway station in the United Kingdom outside of London. Its metropolitan economy is a significant economic powerhouse for the Midlands and is the second-largest in the United Kingdom with a GDP of $121.1bn (2014). It is also a region of multiple higher education institutions, including the University of Birmingham, making it the largest centre of higher education in the country outside London.

Tourism is a large part of economic activity for the metro area. Birmingham is the third most visited city in the United Kingdom by people from foreign nations as of 2022. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Birmingham Royal Ballet, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the Library of Birmingham and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts all enjoy international reputations. Stratford-upon-Avon is a site of significant tourist interest, being the birth town of William Shakespeare.

<doc id="952874" wikidata="Q4287022" url="?curid=952874" title="Cold War Victory Medal">
<text>The Cold War Victory Medal is not an official medal of the United States federal government, but is a state National Guard medal in Louisiana and Texas, and in ribbon form only by the State of Alaska, for those who served in their positions honorably during the years of the Cold War, defined as lasting from September 2, 1945 to December 26, 1991. In the medal&#x27;s unofficial capacity it can be purchased, but not worn in uniform.

==Background and history==
In accordance with section 1084 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998, Congress commended the members of the Armed Forces and civilian personnel who contributed to the victory of the Western Alliance in the Cold War, and authorized and instructed the then-Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, to prepare a certificate recognizing the Cold War service of qualifying members of the Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the Department of Defense and other government agencies. The certificate became known as the Cold War Recognition Certificate available by request of the individual by all members of the armed forces and qualified federal government civilian personnel who honorably served the United States anytime during the Cold War, which is defined as September 2, 1945 to December 26, 1991.

In October 2001, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2002, which is signed into law on December 28, 2001 by President George W. Bush. In the NDAA approved by both houses and signed into law by the president, was a Sense of the Congress resolution that the Secretary of Defense should consider authorizing the issuance of a Campaign medal, to be known as the Cold War Service Medal, to each person who while a member of the Armed Forces served satisfactorily on active duty during the Cold War. The then-Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, did not create such a medal.

The official U.S. Navy web page states: &quot;The Department of Defense will not be creating a Cold War Service medal&quot; and that any commemorative medals made by private vendors are unauthorized on the military uniform. At present the Cold War Victory Medal remains strictly commemorative and is unofficial other than for members of the Louisiana National Guard (medal and ribbon), Texas National Guard (medal and ribbon) and Alaska National Guard (ribbon only) .

The Cold War Victory Medal is also referred to as the &quot;Cold War Commemorative Medal&quot;, &quot;Cold War Service Medal&quot;, or simply as the &quot;Cold War Medal&quot;. There are no devices or attachments authorized for the Cold War Victory Medal.

The Cold War Victory Medal was designed by Nadine Russell, the Chief of Creative Heraldry at the Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry and the designer of many campaign and service medals, including the Southwest Asia Service Medal, the Armed Forces Service Medal, and the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal.

==National Guard awards medal==
The National Guard Bureau does not issue nor recognize the Cold War Victory Medal. The medal is worn as a National Guard award and issued by the Louisiana National Guard. The Adjutant General of the State of Louisiana currently authorizes the decoration as the &quot;Louisiana Cold War Victory Medal&quot;. Eligible members, including active duty members, of the Louisiana National Guard are authorized to wear the medal in uniform while in the State of Louisiana and not on federal property in that state (e.g., Fort Polk).

The Alaska National Guard has authorized the Cold War Victory Ribbon as the Alaska Cold War Service Ribbon, and authorized it for wear on the military uniforms for the Alaska Army National Guard, Alaska Air National Guard, the Alaska Naval Militia, and the Alaska State Defense Force. Wear of the medal form of this award is optional, in that the state does not provide the medal, only the ribbon. Authorized recipients of the ribbon may purchase and wear the medal (full size or miniature) at their own expense, but consistent when wear of medals is directed, such as the Governor&#x27;s Annual Dinner.

==State defense force award==
Several state defense forces have authorized wear of the award for members who meet the requirements. The Alaska State Defense Force, the New Mexico State Guard, and the Texas State Guard have authorized the award for wear on their uniforms.

==Various commemorative versions of the medal==
The Cold War Victory Medal is also a civilian medal which may be privately purchased but is not distributed by the United States government. As such, the decoration is not presently authorized for wear on active duty military uniforms. However, the medal has been officially adopted by the Military Order of Foreign Wars of the United States and is thus frequently worn by U.S. military retirees, veterans and civilians on public holidays, parades and veterans functions. In this regard, the order of precedence of the Cold War Victory Medal is immediately after the lowest authorized U.S. award.

There are various versions of the medal privately struck by many different vendors. However, the only version which has been officially adopted by the Military Order of Foreign Wars has been the Cold War Victory Medal designed by Nadine Russell of the Institute of Heraldry. It has also been officially adopted by the American Cold War Veterans organization.
The Germany Defense Veterans of America has also adopted and authorized this medal to all the members of the Germany Defense Veterans of America as this organization&#x27;s wear of medals on the GDVA uniform.

==Bills introduced in Congress to enact authorization to wear medal==
Over the years bills have been introduced in five separate Congresses for the authorization of a Cold War Victory Medal or Cold War Service Medal. To date bills have successfully passed both houses but get stripped out in committee. All medal bills have been opposed by the U.S. Department of Defense, as it would overlap with service and campaign medals already issued for the Vietnam War and the Korean War, as well as the costs of issuing millions of medals to eligible veterans. On February 17, 2011, Senator Olympia Snowe (ME) and on May 24, 2011, Representative Steve Israel (NY-2) reintroduced legislation in the Senate and House, respectively, that the Secretary of Defense concerned may issue a service medal, to be known as the `Cold War Service Medal&#x27;, to Cold War veterans who meet the criteria.

<doc id="952876" wikidata="Q793777" url="?curid=952876" title="Azilian">
<text>The Azilian is a Mesolithic industry of the Franco-Cantabrian region of northern Spain and Southern France. It dates approximately 10,000–12,500 years ago. Diagnostic artifacts from the culture include projectile points (microliths with rounded retouched backs), crude flat bone harpoons and pebbles with abstract decoration. The latter were first found in the River Arize at the type-site for the culture, the &quot;Grotte du Mas d&#x27;Azil&quot; at Le Mas-d&#x27;Azil in the French Pyrenees (illustrated, now with a modern road running through it). These are the main type of Azilian art, showing a great reduction in scale and complexity from the Magdalenian Art of the Upper Palaeolithic.

The industry can be classified as part of the Epipaleolithic or the Mesolithic periods, or of both. Archaeologists think the Azilian represents the tail end of the Magdalenian as the warming climate brought about changes in human behaviour in the area. The effects of melting ice sheets would have diminished the food supply and probably impoverished the previously well-fed Magdalenian manufacturers, or at least those who had not followed the herds of horse and reindeer out of the glacial refugium to new territory. As a result, Azilian tools and art were cruder and less expansive than their Ice Age predecessors - or simply different.

People associated with the Azilian are genetically different from the preceding Magdalenian peoples, instead being related to peoples from who produced the Epigravettian culture as part of the Villabruna/Western Hunter Gatherer ancestry cluster, though with some ancestry from the preceding Magdalenian peoples.

==Terminology==
The Azilian was named by Édouard Piette, who excavated the Mas d&#x27;Azil type-site in 1887. Unlike other coinages by Piette, the name was generally accepted, indeed in the early 20th century used for much greater areas than it is today. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History and a palaeontologist rather than an archaeologist, was taken around the sites by leading excavators such as Hugo Obermaier. The popularizing book he published in 1916, 
&quot;Men of the Old Stone Age&quot; talks happily of Azilian sites as far north as Oban in Scotland, wherever flattened barbed &quot;harpoon&quot; points of deer antler are found.

Subsequently, Azilian types of artefact have been defined more precisely, and similar examples from beyond the Franco-Cantabrian region generally excluded and reassigned, although references to &quot;Azilian&quot; finds much further north than the Franco-Cantabrian region still appear in non-specialized sources. Terms like &quot;Azilian-like&quot; and even &quot;epi-Azilian&quot; may be used to describe such finds.

==Characteristics==

The Azilian in Vasco-Cantabria occupied a similar region to the Magdalenian, and in very many cases the same sites; typically the Azilian remains are fewer, and rather simpler, than those from the Magdalenian occupation beneath, indicative of a smaller group of people. As the glaciers retreated, sites increasingly reach into the slopes of the Cantabrian Mountains as high as 1,000 metres above sea level, though presumably the higher ones were only occupied in the summers. The grand cavern at Mas d&#x27;Azil is not entirely typical of Azilian sites, many of which are shallow shelters at the bottom of a rock face.

===Azilian pebbles===

Painted, and sometimes engraved pebbles (or &quot;cobbles&quot;) are a feature of core Azilian sites; some 37 sites have produced them. The decoration is simple patterns of dots, zig-zags, and stripes, with some crosses or hatching, normally just on one side of the pebble, which is usually thin and flattish, and some 4 to 10 cm across. Large numbers may be found at a site. The colours are usually red from iron oxide, or sometimes black; the paint was often mixed in &quot;Pecten&quot; saltwater scallop shells, even at Mas d&#x27;Azil, which is far from the sea. Attempts to find a meaning for their iconography have not got very far, although &quot;the repeated combinations of motifs does seem to some extent to be ordered, which may suggest a simple syntax&quot;. Such attempts began with Piette, who believed the pebbles carried a primitive writing system.

==Neighbours==
The Azilian culture coexisted with similar early Mesolithic European cultures, such as the Federmesser in northern Europe, the Tjongerian in the Low countries, the Romanellian culture of Italy, the Creswellian in Britain and the Clisurian in Romania (in a process called azilianization).

In its late phase, it experienced strong influences from the neighbouring Tardenoisian, reflected in the presence of many geometrical microliths. The Azilian culture persisted until the arrival of the Neolithic Era. The Asturian culture in the area to the west along the coast was also similar, but added a distinctive form of pick-axe to its toolkit.

==Gallery==
==In Southern Iberia==
A culture very similar to the Azilian spread as well into Mediterranean Spain and southern Portugal. Because it lacked bone industry it is named distinctively as &quot;Iberian microlaminar microlithism&quot;. It was replaced by the so-called &quot;geometrical microlithism&quot; related to Sauveterrian culture.

==Genetics==
In a genetic study published in 2014, the remains of an Azilian male from the Grotte du Bichon were examined. He was found to be carrying the paternal haplogroup I2 and the maternal haplogroup U5b1h.

Villalba-Mouco &quot;et al&quot; examined the remains of two males of the Azilian culture buried at the Late Upper Paleolithic site of Balma de Guilanyà, Catalonia, Spain c. 11,380-9,990 BC. They were found to be carrying the paternal haplogroups I and C1a1a, and the maternal haplogroups U5b2a and U2&#x27;3&#x27;4&#x27;7&#x27;8&#x27;9. They consisted of a mixture of ancestry between people from the preceding Magdalenian culture, as well as Villabruna/Western Hunter-Gatherer cluster, which shares affinities to people from the Middle East and Caucasus.

<text>The Sheffield Assay Office is one of the four remaining assay offices in the United Kingdom, the other three being in London, Birmingham, and Edinburgh.

In 1773, Sheffield&#x27;s silversmiths joined with those of Birmingham to petition Parliament for the establishment of assay offices in their respective cities. In spite of determined opposition by London silversmiths, an act of Parliament, the Plate Assay (Sheffield and Birmingham) Act 1772 (13 Geo. 3. c. 52), was passed in March, just one month after the original petition was presented to Parliament, to allow Birmingham and Sheffield the right to assay silver.

The Assay Office was then founded and hallmarked its first piece on 20 September 1773. Lots were drawn to determine which marks the offices would use. Sheffield won and chose the crown, while Birmingham took the anchor. Originally, only silver produced within twenty miles of Sheffield could be marked at the office. From 1784, Sheffield was empowered to keep a register of all maker&#x27;s marks within one hundred miles, including those of Birmingham.
In 1795, after several moves, an office was established on Fargate. In 1880 it moved to Leopold Street, and in 1958 to Portobello Street. In May 2007 it was announced that the office would move to a new purpose-built site on Beulah Road in Owlerton, where is it now based.

In 1977, Sheffield&#x27;s mark was changed to the White Rose of York, and it became the last office to standardise its date letters.

<text>James Butler Sigourney (about 1790 – 14 July 1813) was an officer in the United States Navy who was killed during the War of 1812.

==Biography==
Sigourney was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and was appointed midshipman on 16 January 1809. He served in &quot;Wasp&quot; and then became sailing master of the brig, &quot;Nautilus&quot;. He was captured with his ship shortly after the outbreak of the War of 1812; and, after his exchange had been effected, he was placed in command of &quot;Asp&quot;, a schooner fitted out to defend the Chesapeake Bay. On 14 July 1813, &quot;Asp&quot; was attacked by three British barges but succeeded in driving them off. On a second attack, however, &quot;Asp&quot; was boarded, and Sigourney was killed at his post on deck.

==Namesakes==
Two U.S. Navy ships have been named USS &quot;Sigourney&quot; in his honor.

<text>This article is intended to give an overview of liberalism in Slovakia.

==History==

===During the Communist era===

In 1944, the conservative Democratic Party was founded. In 1948, the Democratic Party was replaced by the pro-communist Party of Slovak Revival.

===Late 20th century===

In 1989, Hungarian liberals established the . In 1992, the party was renamed to the Hungarian Civic Party. In 1998, the party merged into the .

Also in 1989, the Party of Slovak Revival renamed itself to Democratic Party. During the same year, Public Against Violence was formed. In 1991, Public Against Violence was renamed to Civic Democratic Union.

In 1993, Dissidents from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia established the Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic, led by Milan Kňažko In 1994, the party merged with a second dissident group, the Alliance for Political Realism, into the Democratic Union of Slovakia (&quot;Demokratická Únia na Slovensku&quot;). In 1995, Democratic Union of Slovakia merged with the National Democratic Party into the Democratic Union.

===21st century===

In 2001, liberals around Pavol Rusko established the Alliance of the New Citizen (ANC). In 2006, Hope split from ANC. In March 2009, liberals around the economist Richard Sulík established the Freedom and Solidarity party, which is the ideological successor of the Alliance of the New Citizen. In 2016–17, liberals founded Progressive Slovakia. In 2018, Together – Civic Democracy led by former SDKÚ-DS member Miroslav Beblavý split from the Slovak Conservative Party.

In 2018, widespread protests over the murder of Ján Kuciak were seen as a signal of a comeback for Slovak liberals. In the 2019 Slovak presidential election, Zuzana Čaputová&#x27;s election as president was described by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; as &quot;[seeming] to confirm the ascendance of Slovak liberals that had started the previous year&quot;.

<text>Richard William Ervin Jr. (born Richard Reehorse Ervin, January 26, 1905 – August 24, 2004) was the Florida Attorney General from 1949 to 1964 and served as chief justice of the Florida Supreme Court from 1969 to 1971. He is credited with guiding the state from segregation (based on the brief he wrote to the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s request from each state&#x27;s Attorney General on how to rule regarding &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;), and desegregating its schools. His son, Richard W. Ervin III, was a judge of the First District Court of Appeal for 30 years and retired at the end of 2006.

Ervin was a graduate of the University of Florida where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity and earned his law degree at the University of Florida College of Law in 1928. Following his retirement, he was of counsel to the law firm founded by his brother Robert Ervin, in Tallahassee. He received an honorary degree from Florida State University. From 1954 to 1975, Ervin was a national director of the fraternal organization Woodmen of the World.

<doc id="952884" wikidata="Q2062571" url="?curid=952884" title="Tom and Jerry (Van Beuren)">
<text>Tom and Jerry are fictional characters that starred in a series of early sound cartoons produced by the Van Beuren Studios, and distributed by RKO Pictures. The series lasted from 1931 to 1933.

American cartoon artist Joseph Barbera began his career as an animator and storyman on this series. In 1940, Barbera co-created with William Hanna another duo of cartoon characters for MGM using the same names: a cat and mouse named &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. When Official Films purchased the Van Beuren library in the early 1940s, the characters were renamed Dick and Larry to avoid confusion with MGM&#x27;s Tom and Jerry. Despite this, animation historians refer to the original Tom and Jerry characters as Van Beuren&#x27;s Tom and Jerry. All of the cartoons are currently available in the public domain.

==Description==
The characters were a Mutt and Jeff-like pair, one short (Jerry) and one tall (Tom). Each cartoon featured a different adventure and the plot varied from film to film. Sometimes they were lawyers, hunters, plumbers, hobos, etc. The duo were likely named after the stage play and/or the mixed drink of the same name, both of which predated the duo by a century through an 1821 book titled &quot;Life in London&quot; written by Pierce Egan (British sportswriter and author of &quot;Boxiana&quot;), which was based on George Cruikshank&#x27;s, Isaac Robert Cruikshank&#x27;s, and Egan&#x27;s own careers. Stylistically, the cartoons were similar to those made by Fleischer Studios, which like Van Beuren Studios was located in New York City; one 1932 short, &quot;Piano Tooners&quot;, even introduced a &quot;flapper&quot; character similar to Fleischer&#x27;s Betty Boop, and Maltin (1980) says &quot;it&#x27;s probable that one of the women who did Betty Boop&#x27;s voice . . . also worked on recording sessions for this studio.&quot; According to Markstein&#x27;s Toonopedia, Fleischer staff sometimes moonlighted at Van Beuren&#x27;s, which was situated just across the road, and this accounts for the many visual similarities between the two. Tom and Jerry&#x27;s adventures were generally absurd comedies featuring music as sound effects. Tom and Jerry, however, did not obtain popularity of the type Mickey Mouse, Betty Boop, and Bosko had, and the series was cancelled in 1933.

==Filmography==
==Home video availability==
Thunderbean Animation released a Blu-ray in January 2024 with the best prints of the shorts currently available, including &#x27;Piano Tooners&#x27; from the original camera negative. it was an upgrade of the DVD they released in 2010.

Also, Mill Creek Entertainment released 12 shorts out of 26 as part of the &quot;Giant 600 Cartoon Collection&quot;, &quot;150 Cartoon Classics&quot;, &quot;100 Classic Cartoons&quot;, and &quot;200 Classic Cartoons&quot; DVD sets. The series appeared on &quot;Tom Sawyer, And Other Cartoon Treasures&quot;, including Tom and Jerry shorts.

Some shorts were eventually restored on some &quot;Cartoon Roots&quot; Blu-ray releases. It was also released on DVD as &quot;Tom and Jerry &amp; Friends: The Tuba Tooter&quot; as part of the Digiview Productions’ &quot;Cartoon Craze&quot; series. The short (&quot;The Tuba Tooter&quot;) was included on one of the discs of &quot;350 Classic Cartoons&quot; as well.

<doc id="952885" wikidata="Q1657643" url="?curid=952885" title="Lawyers Without Borders">
<text>Lawyers Without Borders (LWOB) is an international non-profit organization founded in 2000 by Connecticut Attorney, Christina M. Storm, which operates worldwide from its central headquarters located in New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.A. Its single affiliate, Lawyers Without Borders UK, was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in London, having acquired UK charity status in June 2010. Lawyers from around the world are engaged as volunteers either individually or through their employers (usually either a law firm or an in-house department) who support LWOB as pro bono partners. To date, the countries which contribute the largest number of lawyer volunteers to LWOB field work are the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia.

The two organizations share the goal of engaging the legal profession in internationally oriented pro bono rule of law work. They support capacity building in the judicial sector of developing nations and regions emerging from conflict through training of judges and lawyers in trial advocacy. The organizations utilize a week-long intense training using mock scenarios in the following contexts: Criminal Law (general), Trafficking in Persons, Inheritance &amp; Succession and Gender Based and Domestic Violence. Other major program areas include: Neutral Trial Observation, Assessment and Evaluation, Technical Assistance (Roadmaps, Manuals, Legal Analysis, Research and Legislative Drafting) and Community Outreach. Community work is focused upon access to justice issues and to date have included themes of civic participation and engagement, rights based education in partnership with local (in-country) NGOs and rights-based education embedded in LWOB supported and managed micro-enterprise.

LWOB integrates major pro bono components in the form of resources and volunteer with the self-funded participation of highly skilled and committed lawyers in nearly all of its programming. This system evaluates the specialized skills of each volunteer and places them into a program after considering and evaluating the following criteria: legal expertise, years in practice, time availability, orientation, language skills and international travel and or living experience. LWOB&#x27;s programs are typically funded by third party foundations and grant making agencies and typically contain &quot;cost-share&quot; components, leveraging donated human resources and in-kind support.

The organization&#x27;s orientation is strictly neutral; like the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières, it does not engage in &quot;watch-dog&quot; advocacy. It does not use media or publicity to bring attention to its work in-country and for the safety of its lawyers and integrity of its in-country work often conducts its programming well below the radar of the international press. This approach has helped LWOB gain the respect of governments and authorities who may have otherwise limited in-country engagement of international NGOs. LWOB&#x27;s programming and models have been implemented throughout Africa (Liberia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Namibia, Cameroon, Tanzania, Mozambique, Rwanda and Uganda). Regions outside Africa where work has been conducted or is planned include: Kyrgyzstan, China, Albania, India.

== Student divisions ==
As of January 2021, there are 29 formally approved Student Divisions of Lawyers without Borders, including at the University of Bristol (UK), the University of Exeter, Durham University (UK), Cambridge University (UK), The London School of Economics (UK), Brooklyn Law School (USA), New York Law School (USA), Oxford University (UK), City University of London, the School of Oriental and African Studies (UK), UConn (Undergraduate), University of Aberdeen (UK), and the Queensland University of Technology (AUS). In the past, LWOB has engaged law students through less formal collaborations at UToronto, UMiami, College of Law (UK), and UConn Law. LWOB offers in-house internships to up to 30 students each year over the course of three terms: Fall, Winter/Spring and Summer. Some virtual internships are available each year and in-country placements are generally available for periods of between 6 – 12 months in Kenya, Liberia and the United Kingdom.

Lawyers Without Borders is an official &quot;Without Borders&quot; trademark-protected organization. It has no affiliation with Avocats Sans Frontières or Doctors Without Borders.

Lawyers Without Borders is commonly known by its United Nations acronym, LWOB.

== Mission statement ==
To advance global rule of law, build capacity and integrity in the world’s justice sectors, and support transitions and development. LWOB engage with lawyers and judges dedicated to pro bono service and integrate them into initiatives that directly or indirectly serve the underserved, protect the disadvantaged, and promote human rights.

LWOB&#x27;s objective is to develop programs that improve access to justice guided by a mandate of neutrality and independence.

<text>The Open and Free Technology Community (OFTC) is an IRC network that provides collaboration services to members of the free software community in any part of the world. OFTC is an associated project of Software in the Public Interest, a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations develop and distribute open hardware and software. As of October 2019, OFTC has 31 volunteer staff members, and 16 sponsors.

== History ==
OFTC was founded at the end of 2001 by a group of experienced members of the open source and free software communities aiming to provide these communities with better communication, development, and support infrastructure. OFTC is ruled by a written constitution and the staff elect the officers among each other using a voting mechanism. OFTC became a member project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI) in July 2002, and SPI became the legal owner of the project&#x27;s domain names.

The ability for all users to connect using Transport Layer Security was added in April 2016 with the use of SSL certificates from the Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificate authority.

In 2016, OFTC was bridged to the Matrix instant messaging network.

== Projects ==
OFTC currently develops three projects for its purposes: &quot;oftc-hybrid&quot; (a fork of the Hybrid IRC daemon), &quot;oftc-ircservices&quot; (the IRC services suite), and &quot;oftc-geodns&quot; (a GeoIP DNS responder to handle user distribution across the servers). OFTC uses GitHub repositories to host its codebase and issue tracker. Prospective users of the software can find tarball releases at https://www.oftc.net/releases/, named according to semantic versioning. Developers contributing to the code base should read and be familiar with Subversion.

<text>Samuel Ernest Vandiver Jr. (July 3, 1918 – February 21, 2005) was an American Democratic Party politician who was the 73rd governor of Georgia from 1959 to 1963.

==Early life and career==
Vandiver was born in Canon in Franklin County in northeastern Georgia. He was the only child of Vanna Bowers and Samuel Ernest Vandiver. His mother had two children from a previous marriage, which ended with the death of her first husband. Vandiver&#x27;s father was a prominent businessman, farmer, and landowner in Franklin County. Vandiver attended public schools in Lavonia and the Darlington School in Rome, Georgia. He graduated from the University of Georgia and the University of Georgia School of Law, both in Athens.

After stateside service as an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, he was elected in 1946 as mayor of Lavonia in Franklin County. That same year he supported Eugene Talmadge&#x27;s candidacy for governor and then Herman Talmadge&#x27;s claim to the office after Eugene&#x27;s death.

In 1948, Talmadge appointed Vandiver to be the state&#x27;s adjutant general. In 1954, Vandiver was elected lieutenant governor.

He ran for governor in 1958 and promised to restore the state&#x27;s image, which had been tarnished by scandals under Governor Marvin Griffin under whom he had served in the second position. Vandiver was overwhelmingly elected. He succeeded Griffin as both lieutenant governor and governor.

==Governor of Georgia==
As governor, Vandiver cleaned up the corruption and mismanagement associated with the Griffin administration. He had pledged to defend segregation, using the campaign motto, &quot;No, not one,&quot; meaning not one black child in a white school.

During the presidential election of 1960, Vandiver supported John F. Kennedy, but not fully. Vandiver favored &quot;independent&quot; electors. This led to the erosion of the Democratic party in the South, and southern resistance to the civil rights movement. In March 1960, Vandiver called &quot;An Appeal for Human Rights&quot;, an article published in the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; by black students at Spelman College, &quot;an anti-American document&quot; that &quot;does not sound like it was written in this country&quot;. Vandiver worked behind the scenes with Kennedy and his brother Robert and ultimately played a role in obtaining the release of Martin Luther King Jr. from jail. King had been arrested during a sit-in at Rich&#x27;s in Atlanta on October 19, 1960.

Vandiver changed from his &quot;No, not one&quot; stance on segregation. Those urging him to change included Ivan Allen Jr. (later mayor of Atlanta), banker Mills B. Lane, Coca-Cola President Robert Woodruff, Griffin Bell (later a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the United States Attorney General under U.S. President Jimmy Carter), and many others.

Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Vandiver said, &quot;All the world is shocked and grieved at the death of our President. I am certain that all Georgians join together in sending our condolences to the grieved family.&quot;

Under Vandiver&#x27;s administration, a United States District Court ordered the admission of two African-American students, Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter, to the University of Georgia. Despite his past support for segregation, Governor Vandiver did not resist the court order, sparing the University of Georgia the national publicity associated with the opposition stands taken in 1962 by Governor Ross Barnett at the University of Mississippi and in 1963 by Governor George C. Wallace at the University of Alabama. After the desegregation of the University of Georgia, Vandiver successfully urged the Georgia General Assembly to repeal a recently passed law barring state funding to integrated schools. He also appointed banker John A. Sibley to head a state commission designed to prepare for the court-ordered school desegregation.

He pledged to maintain the county unit system, a type of electoral college that had been employed to elect Georgia governors, but it was struck down by a decision of the United States Supreme Court as unconstitutional. He then ordered the Democratic State Central Committee to conduct the 1962 primary by popular vote.

Vandiver&#x27;s efficiency in running state government permitted a building program and the expansion of state services without tax increases. The state expanded its ports, encouraged tourism, promoted business and industry, expanded vocational-technical education, and authorized programs for the mentally ill.

==Later career==

In 1966, Vandiver was initially a candidate for governor and had been expected to compete with another former governor, Ellis Arnall. However, Vandiver withdrew for health reasons. When the Democratic nomination went not to Arnall but to the Atlanta businessman Lester Maddox, a strong segregationist, the Democrat Vandiver endorsed in the general election the Republican nominee, U.S. Representative Howard &quot;Bo&quot; Callaway, then of Pine Mountain. Maddox was ultimately elected by the Georgia legislature after election returns failed to produce a winner by majority vote.

Had Vandiver&#x27;s health permitted him to run for governor in 1966, Callaway would have instead sought reelection to the U.S. House. When Vandiver looked like a potential Democratic nominee, Callaway asked William R. Bowdoin Sr. (1913–1996), an Atlanta banker and civic figure who had chaired a commission on state government reorganization, to run as a Republican gubernatorial candidate. Oddly, Carl Sanders, the term-limited governor, asked Bowdoin to run that year as a Democrat.

In 1972, at the age of fifty-four, Vandiver ran for the United States Senate for a full term to replace his wife&#x27;s uncle, veteran Senator Richard Russell Jr., who had died in office in 1971. Vandiver finished third behind Sam Nunn and appointed Senator David H. Gambrell in the Democratic primary election. Nunn defeated the Republican Fletcher Thompson, an Atlanta-area U.S. representative even as Richard M. Nixon was sweeping Georgia in the presidential election against the Democrat George S. McGovern.

In his final years, Vandiver would express regret at his earlier segregationist positions. &quot;I said a lot of intemperate things back then that I now have to live with,&quot; he said in 2002. &quot;All I can say now is that you are of your time.&quot;

==Marriage and the Russell family==
Vandiver was married to Betty Russell, a niece of Senator Russell, who had also served earlier as governor. Russell was popular and powerful in Georgia and helped to promote his nephew-in-law&#x27;s career.

Vandiver was a son in law of Judge Robert Lee Russell and grandson-in-law of Judge Richard Russell Sr. For information, see Russell family.

==Death==
Ernest Vandiver died on February 21, 2005, at the age of eighty-six at his home in Lavonia, Georgia. In addition to his wife, he was survived by three children: Samuel Ernest &quot;Chip&quot; Vandiver, III; Vanna Elizabeth (named for her paternal grandmother and mother) Vandiver; and Jane Brevard Vandiver, who as Jane V. Kidd was elected as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from Athens and in 2007 as the chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party.

==Memorials==
The stretch of I-85 through Franklin County, Georgia, is named &quot;Ernest Vandiver Highway&quot; in his memory. Vandiver had worked to make sure the highway traversed Franklin County, instead of proceeding further north as originally planned.

On September 26, 2008, the University of Georgia dedicated a residence hall in the East Campus Village to Vandiver.

<text>HP 9000 is a line of workstation and server computer systems produced by the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Company. The native operating system for almost all HP 9000 systems is HP-UX, which is based on UNIX System V.

The HP 9000 brand was introduced in 1984 to encompass several extant technical workstation models launched formerly in the early 1980s. Most of these were based on the Motorola 68000 series, but there were also entries based on HP&#x27;s own FOCUS designs. From the mid-1980s, the line was transitioned to HP&#x27;s new PA-RISC architecture. Finally, in the 2000s, systems using the IA-64 were added.

The HP 9000 server line was discontinued in 2003, being superseded by Itanium-based Integrity Servers running HP-UX. The HP 9000 workstation line was discontinued in 2009, being superseded by HP Z.

==History==
The first HP 9000 models comprised the HP 9000 Series 200 and Series 500 ranges. These were rebadged existing models, the Series 200 including various Motorola 68000 (68k) based workstations such as the HP 9826 and HP 9836, and the Series 500 using HP&#x27;s FOCUS microprocessor architecture introduced in the HP 9020 workstation. These were followed by the HP 9000 Series 300 and Series 400 workstations which also used 68k-series microprocessors. From the mid-1980s onward, HP began changing to its own microprocessors based on its proprietary PA-RISC instruction set architecture (ISA), for the Series 600, 700, 800, and later lines. More recent models use either the PA-RISC or its successor, the HP–Intel IA-64 ISA.

All of the HP 9000 line run various versions of the HP-UX operating system, except earlier Series 200 models, which ran standalone applications or the Basic Workstation / Pascal 3.1 Workstation operating systems. HP released the Series 400, also known as the Apollo 400, after acquiring Apollo Computer in 1989. These models had the ability to run either HP-UX or Apollo&#x27;s Domain/OS.

From the early 1990s onward, HP replaced the HP 9000 &quot;Series&quot; numbers with an alphabetical &quot;Class&quot; nomenclature. In 2001, HP again changed the naming scheme for their HP 9000 servers. The A-class systems were renamed as the rp2400s, the L-class became the rp5400s, and the N-class the rp7400s. The &quot;rp&quot; prefix signified a PA-RISC architecture, while &quot;rx&quot; was used for IA-64-based systems, later rebranded HPE Integrity Servers.

In 2003, HP launched the xw series, which uses x86 processors and runs Windows. The xw series remained until 2009 when it was replaced by HP Z.

On 30 April 2008, HP announced end of sales for the PA-RISC-based HP 9000. The last order date for PA-RISC-based HP 9000 systems was 31 December 2008 and the last ship date was 1 April 2009. The last order date for new HP 9000 PA-RISC options was December 31, 2009, with a last ship date of 1 April 2010. HP intends to support these systems through to 2013, with possible extensions.

The end of life for HP 9000 also marks the end of an era, as it essentially marks HP&#x27;s withdrawal from the Unix workstation market (the HP 9000 workstations are end of life, and there are no HP Integrity workstations, so there is no longer a solution which targets HP/UX at the desktop). When the move from PA-RISC (9000) to Itanium (Integrity) was announced, Integrity workstations running either HP/UX or Windows were initially announced and offered, but were moved to end of sales life relatively quickly, with no replacement (arguably because x86-64 made IA-64 uncompetitive on the desktop, and HP/UX does not support x86-64, with HP offering desktop Linux as an alternative, not fully compatible, solution).

===Series 200===

The Series 200 workstations originated before there were any &quot;Series&quot; at HP. The first model was the HP 9826A, followed by the HP 9836A. Later, a color version of the 9836 (9836C) was introduced. There was also a rack-mount version, the HP 9920A. These were all based on the Motorola 68000 chip. There were &#x27;S&#x27; versions of the models that included memory bundled in. When HP-UX was included as an OS, there was a &#x27;U&#x27; version of the 9836s and 9920 that used the 68012 processor. The model numbers included the letter &#x27;U&#x27; (9836U, 9836CU, and 9920U). Later versions of the Series 200&#x27;s included the 9816, 9817, and 9837. These systems were soon renamed as the HP Series 200 line, before being renamed again as part HP 9000 family, the HP 9000 Series 200.

There was also a &quot;portable&quot; version of the Series 200 called the Integral. The official model was the HP9807. This machine was about the size of a portable sewing machine, contained a MC68000 processor, ROM based HP-UX, 3½ inch floppy disk drive, inkjet printer, a keyboard, mouse, and an electroluminescent display similar to the early GRiD Compass computers. It was not battery powered, and unlike the other Series 200&#x27;s that were manufactured in Fort Collins, Colorado, it was made in Corvallis, Oregon.

===Series 300/400===

The Series 300 workstations were based around Motorola 68000-series processors, ranging from the 68010 (Model 310, introduced 1985) to the Motorola 68040 (Model 38x, introduced 1991). The Series 400 (introduced 1990) were intended to supersede the Apollo/Domain workstations and were also based on the 68030/040. They were branded &quot;HP Apollo&quot; and added Apollo Domain/OS compatibility. The suffix &#x27;s&#x27; and &#x27;t&#x27; used on the Series 400 represented &quot;Side&quot; (as in Desk side) and &quot;Top&quot; (as in Desk top) model. The last two digits of the Series 400 originally was the clock frequency of the processor in MHz (e.g. 433 was 33 MHz). At introduction, the Series 400 had a socket for the MC68040, but since they were not available at the time, an emulator card with an MC68030 and additional circuitry was installed. Customers who purchased systems were given a guaranteed upgrade price of $5,000USD to the MC68040, when they became available. The Series 300 and 400 shared the same I/O interface as the Series 200. The 32-bit DIO-II bus is rated at 6 MB/s.

===Series 500===
The Series 500s were based on the HP FOCUS microprocessor. They began as the HP 9020, HP 9030, and HP 9040, were renamed the HP Series 500 Model 20, 30, and 40 shortly after introduction, and later renamed again as the HP 9000 Model 520, 530 and 540. The 520 was a complete workstation with built-in keyboard, display, 5.25-inch floppy disk, and optional thermal printer and 5 MB hard disk. The 520 could run BASIC or HP-UX and there were three different models based on the displays attached (two color and one monochrome). The 530 was a rackmount version of the Series 500, could only run HP-UX, and used a serial interface console. The 540 was a 530 mounted inside a cabinet, similar to the disk drives offered then and included a serial multiplexer (MUX). Later models of the Series 500s were the 550 and 560, which had a completely different chassis and could be connected to graphics processors. The processors in the original Series 500s ran at 20 MHz, and could reach a benchmark speed of 1 million instructions per second (MIPS), equivalent to a VAX-11/780, then a common benchmark standard. They could be networked together and with 200 and 300 series using the Shared Resource Manager (SRM).

Because of their performance, the US government placed the 500 series on its export restricted list. The computers were only permitted to be sold in Western Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, with any other country needing written approval.

===Series 700===

The first workstations in the series, the Model 720, Model 730 and Model 750 systems were introduced on 26 March 1991 and were code-named &quot;Snakes&quot;. The models used the PA-7000 microprocessor, with the Model 720 using a 50 MHz version and the Model 730 and Model 750 using a 66 MHz version. The PA-7000 is provided with 128 KB of instruction cache on the Model 720 and 730 and 256 KB on the Model 750. All models are provided with 256 KB of data cache. The Model 720 and Model 730 supported 16 to 64 MB of memory, while the Model 750 supported up to 192 MB. Onboard SCSI was provided by an NCR 53C700 SCSI controller. These systems could use both 2D and 3D graphics options, with 2D options being the greyscale GRX and the color CRX. 3D options were the Personal VRX and the Turbo GRX.

In early January 1992, HP introduced the Model 705, code-named &quot;Bushmaster Snake&quot;, and the Model 710, code-named &quot;Bushmaster Junior&quot;. Both systems are low-end diskless workstations, with the Model 705 using a 32 MHz PA-7000 and the Model 710 using a 50 MHz version. At introduction, the Model 705 was priced at under US$5,000, and the Model 710 under US$10,000.

The first Series 700 workstations were superseded by the Model 715/33, 715/50, 725/50 low-end workstations and the Model 735/99, 735/125, 755/99 and 755/125 high-end workstations on 10 November 1992. The existing Model 715 and Model 725 were later updated with the introduction of the Model 715/75 and 725/75 in September 1993. The new models used a 75 MHz PA-7100.

Increasing integration led to the introduction of the Model 712/60 and Model 712/80i workstations on 18 January 1994. Code-named &quot;Gecko&quot;, these models were intended to compete with entry-level workstations from Sun Microsystems and high-end personal computers. They used the PA-7100LC microprocessor operating at 60 and 80 MHz, respectively. The Model 712/80i was an integer only model, with the floating point-unit disabled. Both supported 16 to 128 MB of memory.

The Model 715/64, 715/80, 715/100 and 725/100 were introduced in May 1994, targeted at the 2D and 3D graphics market. These workstations use the PA-7100LC microprocessor and supported 32 to 128 MB of memory, except for the Model 725/100, which supported up to 512 MB.

The Model 712/100 (&quot;King Gecko&quot;), an entry-level workstation, and Model 715/100 XC, a mid-range workstation, were introduced in June 1995. The Model 712/100 is a Model 712 with a 100 MHz PA-7100LC and 256 KB of cache while the Model 715/100 XC is a Model 715/100 with 1 MB of cache.

The Model 712 and 715 workstations feature the Lasi ASIC, connected by the GSC bus. The Lasi ASIC provided an integrated NCR 53C710 SCSI controller, an Intel Apricot 10 Mbit Ethernet interface, CD-quality sound, PS/2 keyboard and mouse, a serial and a parallel port. All models, except for the 712 series machines also use the Wax ASIC to provide an EISA adapter, a second serial port and support for the HIL bus.

The SGC bus (System Graphics Connect), which is used in the earlier series 700 workstations, has similar specifications as PCI with 32-bit/33 MHz and a typical bandwidth of about 100 MB/s .

====VME Industrial Workstations====
Models 742i, 743i, 744, 745/745i, 747i, 748i.

===B, C, J class===


The C100, C110, J200, J210 and J210XC use the PA-7200 processor, connected to the UTurn IOMMU via the Runway bus. The C100 and C110 are single processor systems, and the J200 and J210 are dual processor systems. The Uturn IOMMU has two GSC buses. These machines continue to use the Lasi and Wax ASICs.

The B132L (introduced 1996), B160L, B132L+, B180L, C132L, C160L and C180L workstations are based on the PA-7300LC processor, a development of the PA-7100LC with integrated cache and GSC bus controller. Standard graphics is the Visualize EG. These machines use the Dino GSC to PCI adapter which also provides the second serial port in place of Wax; they optionally have the Wax EISA adapter.

The C160, C180, C180-XP, J280 and J282 use the PA-8000 processor and are the first 64-bit HP workstations. They are based on the same Runway/GSC architecture as the earlier C and J class workstations.

The C200, C240 and J2240 offer increased speed with the PA-8200 processor and the C360 uses the PA-8500 processor.

The B1000, B2000, C3000, J5000 and J7000 were also based on the PA-8500 processor, but had a very different architecture. The U2/Uturn IOMMU and the GSC bus is gone, replaced with the Astro IOMMU, connected via Ropes to several Elroy PCI host adapters.

The B2600, C3600 and J5600 upgrade these machines with the PA-8600 processor. The J6000 is a rack-mountable workstation which can also be stood on its side in a tower configuration.

The C3650, C3700, C3750, J6700 and J6750 are PA-8700-based.

The C8000 uses the dual-core PA-8800 or PA-8900 processors, which uses the same bus as the McKinley and Madison Itanium processors and shares the same zx1 chipset. The Elroy PCI adapters have been replaced with Mercury PCI-X adapters and one Quicksilver AGP 8x adapter.

===D-class (Codename: Ultralight)===
The D-class are entry-level and mid-range servers that succeeded the entry-level E-class servers and the mid-range G-, H-, I-class servers. The first models were introduced in late January 1996, consisting of the Model D200, D210, D250, D310 and D350. The Model D200 is a uniprocessor with a 75 MHz PA-7100LC microprocessor, support for up to 512 MB of memory and five EISA/HP-HSC slots. The Model D210 is similar, but it used a 100 MHz PA-7100LC. The Model D250 is dual-processor model and it used the 100 MHz PA-7100LC. It supported up to 768 MB of memory and had five EISA/HP-HSC slots. The Model D310 is a uniprocessor with a 100 MHz PA-7100LC, up to 512 MB of memory and eight EISA/HP-HSC slots. The Model D350 is a high-end D-class system, a dual-processor, it had two 100 MHz PA-7100LCs, up to 768 MB of memory and eight EISA/HP-HSC slots.

In mid-September 1996, two new D-class servers were introduced to utilize the new 64-bit PA-8000 microprocessor, the Model D270 uniprocessor and the Model D370 dual-processor. Both were positioned as entry-level servers. They used the 160 MHz PA-8000 and supported 128 MB to 1.5 GB of memory.

In January 1997, the low-end Model D220, D230, D320 and D330 were introduced, using 132 and 160 MHz versions of the PA-7300LC microprocessor.

The D-class are tower servers with up to two microprocessors and are architecturally similar to the K-class. They sometimes masquerade as larger machines as HP shipped them mounted vertically inside a large cabinet containing a power supply and multiple disks with plenty of room for air to circulate.

===R-class===
The R-class is simply a D-class machine packaged in a rack-mount chassis. Unlike the D-class systems, it does not support hot-pluggable disks.

===N-class===
The N-class is a 10U rackmount server with up to eight CPUs and 12 PCI slots. It uses two Merced buses, one for every four processor slots. It is not a NUMA machine, having equal access to all memory slots. The I/O is unequal though; having one Ike IOMMU per bus means that one set of CPUs are closer to one set of I/O slots than the other.

The N-class servers were marketed as &quot;Itanium-ready&quot;, although when the Itanium shipped, no Itanium upgrade was made available for the N class. The N class did benefit from using the Merced bus, bridging the PA-8x00 microprocessors to it via a special adapter called DEW.

The N4000 was upgraded with newer processors throughout its life, with models called N4000-36, N4000-44 and N4000-55 indicating microprocessor clock frequencies of 360, 440, and 550 MHz, respectively. It was renamed to the rp7400 series in 2001.

===L-class===
The L-class servers are 7U rackmount machines with up to 4 CPUs (depending on model). They have 12 PCI slots, but only 7 slots are enabled in the entry-level L1000 system. Two of the PCI slots are occupied by factory integrated cards and cannot be utilized for I/O expansion by the end-user.

The L1000 and L2000 are similar to the A400 and A500, being based on an Astro/Elroy combination. They initially shipped with 360 MHz and 440 MHz PA-8500 and were upgraded with 540 MHz PA-8600.

The L3000 is similar to the N4000, being based on a DEW/Ike/Elroy combination. It shipped only with 550 MHz PA-8600 CPUs.

The L-class family was renamed to the rp5400 series in 2001.

===A-class===
The A180 and A180C were 32-bit, single-processor, 2U servers based on the PA-7300LC processor with the Lasi and Dino ASICs.

The A400 and A500 servers were 64-bit, single and dual-processor 2U servers based on the PA-8500 and later processors, using the Astro IOMMU and Elroy PCI adapters. The A400-36 and A500-36 machines used the PA-8500 processor running at 360 MHz; the A400-44 and A500-44 are clocked at 440 MHz. The A500-55 uses a PA-8600 processor running at 550 MHz and the A500-75 uses a PA-8700 processor running at 750 MHz.

The A-class was renamed to the rp2400 series in 2001.

===S/X-class===
The S- and X-class were Convex Exemplar SPP2000 supercomputers rebadged after HP&#x27;s acquisition of Convex Computer in 1995. The S-class was a single-node SPP2000 with up to 16 processors, while the X-class name was used for multi-node configurations with up to 512 processors. These machines ran Convex&#x27;s SPP-UX operating system.

===V-class===
The V-class servers were based on the multiprocessor technology from the S-class and X-class. The V2200 and V2250 support a maximum of 16 processors, and the V2500 and V2600 support a maximum of 32 processors. The V-class systems are physically large systems that need extensive cooling and three-phase electric power to operate. They provided a transitional platform between the T-class and the introduction of the Superdome.

==Operating systems==
Apart from HP-UX and Domain/OS (on the 400), many HP 9000s can also run the Linux operating system. Some PA-RISC-based models are able to run NeXTSTEP.

Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix was ported to the HP 9000 as HPBSD; the resulting support code was later added to 4.4BSD. Its modern variants NetBSD and OpenBSD also support various HP 9000 models, both Motorola 68k and PA-RISC based.

In the early 1990s, several Unix R&amp;D systems were ported to the PA-RISC platform, including several attempts of OSF/1, various Mach ports and systems that combined parts of Mach with other systems (MkLinux, Mach 4/Lites). The origin of these ports were mostly either internal HP Labs projects or HP products, or academic research, mostly at the University of Utah.

One project conducted at HP Laboratories involved replacing core HP-UX functionality, specifically the virtual memory and process management subsystems, with Mach functionality from Mach 2.0 and 2.5. This effectively provided a vehicle to port Mach to the PA-RISC architecture, as opposed to starting with the Berkeley Software Distribution configured to use the Mach kernel infrastructure and porting this to PA-RISC, and thereby delivered a version of HP-UX 2.0 based on Mach, albeit with certain features missing from both Mach and HP-UX. The motivation for the project was to investigate performance issues with Mach related to the cache architecture of PA-RISC along with potential remedies for these issues.

<text>Sir Daniel Hunter McMillan, (January 14, 1846 – April 14, 1933) was a Manitoba politician. He was a cabinet minister in Thomas Greenway&#x27;s government from 1889 to 1900, and served as the seventh Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1900 to 1911.

== Biography ==
McMillan was born in Whitby, Canada West (now Ontario), and was educated there and at Collingwood. His initial career goal was to be a professional soldier. He saw active service on the Niagara frontier in 1864, and was an officer with the 19th Lincoln Battalion of Infantry involved in repelling the Fenian raids of 1866. In 1870, he served in the expedition of Col. Wolseley which ended the Red River Rebellion. Staying in Manitoba, McMillan would be one of the founding officers of the 90th Winnipeg Battalion of Rifles in 1883. When the North-West Rebellion broke out in 1885, McMillan became a Major with the newly formed 95th Battalion of Infantry (Manitoba Grenadiers) and later was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on June 17, 1887. In 1904, McMillan would be appointed Colonel of the 12th Manitoba Dragoons.

McMillan settled in Winnipeg following the Wolseley expedition, and became a successful businessman within the city. He established a milling and grain business in Winnipeg in 1874, and oversaw the first shipment of western Canadian wheat to Minneapolis shortly thereafter. He also served as the first president of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange for one year (1887–1888), served too as a Director and later Vice-President of the Great-West Life Assurance Company.

McMillan became politically active during this period. In 1879, he ran for the Manitoba legislature in the riding of Winnipeg against Thomas Scott, the leader of the opposition to John Norquay&#x27;s government. Norquay was supported by both Liberals and Conservatives at the time, and McMillan was a prominent member of the Winnipeg Liberal community. Despite strong backing from the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot;, however, he lost to Scott by 387 votes to 321.

The 1879 election was unusual even by the standards of early Manitoba politics, in that both Norquay and Scott claimed the support of a majority of elected members after the results were announced. Eventually, Norquay consolidated his hold over the government and Scott departed for federal politics. On December 4, 1880, McMillan was elected for Winnipeg in a by-election, defeating Alexander Logan.

Norquay would gradually break his ties with the Winnipeg Liberals over the next two years, and forged an alliance with the province&#x27;s Conservative establishment in 1882. It may be assumed that McMillan had crossed into the opposition by this time. He was never a cabinet minister under Norquay, and did not run for re-election in 1883.

Thomas Greenway&#x27;s Liberals were called to form a government in January 1888, and won a landslide majority in a general election held later in the year. McMillan was returned to parliament for the riding of Winnipeg Centre in this election, defeating Conservative Thomas Gilroy by 972 votes to 470. He was not immediately called into Greenway&#x27;s cabinet, but was named Provincial Treasurer on May 7, 1889. He held this position for the remainder of Greenway&#x27;s time as Premier, and was given the additional portfolio of Provincial Lands Commissioner on October 7, 1896. He had no difficulty being re-elected in 1892, and won unopposed in 1896.

Greenway&#x27;s Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives under Hugh John Macdonald in 1899, although McMillan retained his seat over Conservative A.J. Andrews by 1364 votes to 1249. On October 9, 1900, he was appointed as the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba by Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier. The post was mostly ceremonial by this time, and McMillan had little practical influence over the governments of Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin. He was knighted in 1902 and stepped down from the Lt. Governor&#x27;s position in 1911.

<doc id="952898" wikidata="Q1138693" url="?curid=952898" title="Craig Unger">
<text>Craig Unger (b. March 25, 1949) is an American journalist and writer. He has served as deputy editor of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; and was editor-in-chief of &quot;Boston&quot; magazine. He has written about George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He has written about the Romney family and Hart InterCivic.

==Early life and education==
Unger grew up in Dallas, Texas, and attended Harvard University.

==Career==
On April 11, 2004, Unger wrote an op-ed for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; demanding answers from the 9/11 Commission on who had given permission for Saudi nationals to leave the United States. He repeated the theme in his 2004 book, &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot;, that was also featured in Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;:
&quot;Is it possible that President Bush himself played a role in authorizing the evacuation of the Saudis after 9/11?&quot; Unger reportedly traced $1.4 billion in investments by the Saudis to friends and business organizations closely associated with the Bush family.

Unger&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Fall of the House of Bush&quot; is about the internal feud in the Bush family and the rise and collusion of the neoconservative and Christian right in Republican party politics, viewing each group&#x27;s world view and efforts concerning present and potential future US policy through a distinctly negative prism. In his previous work, &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot; explored the relationship between the Bush family and the House of Saud.

In his 2018 book, &quot;House of Trump, House of Putin: The Untold Story of Donald Trump and the Russian Mafia&quot;, Unger tells about links existing between the Russian mafia, Vladimir Putin and the Trump Organization. He names 59 Russians as long-term business associates of Donald Trump

<doc id="952902" wikidata="Q1068689" url="?curid=952902" title="Cheaters (2000 film)">
<text>Cheaters is a 2000 American drama television film written and directed by John Stockwell and starring Jeff Daniels, Jena Malone, Blake Heron, Luke Edwards, and Paul Sorvino. It chronicles the true story of the 1994–1995 Steinmetz High School team that cheated in the United States Academic Decathlon (USAD). It aired on HBO on May 20, 2000. It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special.

==Plot==
In 1995 Chicago, Jolie Fitch is a junior at Steinmetz High School who enjoys Dr. Jerry Plecki&#x27;s English class. Dr. Plecki is offered the position of Academic Decathlon coach, a job all the other teachers consider to be a waste of time. Dr. Plecki holds an open call for the students, but no one arrives to participate. Jolie convinces him that he needs to look for the smarter students and recruit them. He recruits seven students (Darius, Matt, Paul, Dominik, Irwin, Agnieszka, and Jolie). They spend the next few months studying hard for the regional competition.

At regionals, the team faces their biggest competitor in Whitney Young Magnet High School, who have consistently won for almost a decade. As expected, Whitney Young is victorious and Steinmetz places 5th overall, but still qualify for the state competition. The students are overwhelmed to be facing Whitney Young in the next round, but an opportunity arises when Matt receives a copy of the test. Irwin then brings it to Dr. Plecki, who feels that using the test is the team&#x27;s best chance to win.

After some persuasion, all seven members agree to copy the answers on various items (calculators, shoes, a piece of gum, etc.). Dr. Plecki then tells Irwin privately that because he had the lowest scores in the group, he will be out of the state competition; however, he will be guaranteed a spot in nationals. Though Irwin is upset, he agrees to go along with it.

At the state finals, Steinmetz meets Whitney Young again. The team successfully gets through the exams with the answers they secretly wrote down and with Jolie coaching them in the Super Quiz. At the end of the day, Steinmetz wins with an overall score of 49,000, raising the ire and suspicions of Whitney Young.

As Steinmetz celebrates, a spiteful Irwin writes an essay, detailing how he feels betrayed by Dr. Plecki and how they received an advance copy of the test. Suspicions heighten when the principal questions Irwin. The Illinois Academic Decathlon board arrives at the school with news that the team will need to take a re-test to validate their scores. If they refuse, they will lose their championship. Feeling betrayed by Irwin and angered by the board&#x27;s ultimatum, they refuse to cooperate and plan to seek an injunction to halt the state from re-testing them.

As the media siege escalates, Angela Lam, a student on the Academic Decathlon team from the year prior, talks to the press about how she was given the answers to the Super Quiz in the state competition by Dr. Plecki. She encourages the current team members to come clean if they cheated. Dr. Plecki is immediately suspended from his teaching duties and the team members are taken to the Board of Education headquarters where they are interrogated individually. Despite being pressured, they refuse to come clean and insist they did not cheat. However, Dominik ultimately confesses after a heart-to-heart talk with one of the investigators.

As a result, the state title is stripped from Steinmetz and awarded to Whitney Young. Dr. Plecki is fired from Steinmetz, and the team members are harassed by the other students for ruining their reputation. Dr. Plecki decides to leave Chicago in hopes the media will disperse and leave the team members alone. He meets with his team one last time by Lake Michigan in downtown Chicago, where they present him with a gift: John Milton&#x27;s book &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; signed by the team and the gold medal in Language and Literature that they didn&#x27;t return to the board. With the team disbanded and Dr. Plecki gone, Jolie feels that she&#x27;s lost a mentor that actually cared about her academic possibilities. In the end, Jolie gets accepted into college and recognizes the merit of her achievements without cheating.

In the epilogue, it is stated that Dominik, Agneiska, and Paul went off to college, Matt worked in a hardware store and was voted employee of the month, Darius&#x27; whereabouts are unknown, Irwin went to college to become a journalist, and Dr. Plecki got married and owned a business.

As a result of the 1995 cheating scandal, Steinmetz High School was banned from fielding an Academic Decathlon team for ten years. They returned to the competition in 2006.

<doc id="952904" wikidata="Q118599" url="?curid=952904" title="23rd Street (Manhattan)">
<text>23rd Street is a broad thoroughfare in the New York City borough of Manhattan, one of the major two-way, east-west streets in the borough&#x27;s grid. As with Manhattan&#x27;s other &quot;crosstown&quot; streets, it is divided into its east and west sections at Fifth Avenue. The street runs from Avenue C and FDR Drive in the east to Eleventh Avenue in the west.

23rd Street was created under the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. The street hosts several famous hotels, including the Fifth Avenue Hotel and Hotel Chelsea, as well as many theaters. Several skyscrapers are located on 23rd Street, including the Flatiron Building, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, and One Madison.

== Description ==
As with other numbered streets in Manhattan, Fifth Avenue separates West and East 23rd Street. This intersection occurs in Madison Square, near Madison Square Park, both of which are part of the Flatiron District. West of Sixth Avenue, West 23rd Street passes through Chelsea. East of Lexington Avenue, East 23rd Street runs along the southern boundary of Kips Bay and the northern boundaries of Gramercy and Peter Cooper Village.

Since 1999, an area north of 23rd Street around the park has been referred to as NoMad.

===West 23rd Street===
West 23rd Street, which runs through the heart of Chelsea, contains many art galleries and several theaters. For much of the late 19th century and early 20th century its western end was the site of the Pavonia Ferry at Pier 63, just north of the current Chelsea Piers.

In 1907, a small lot of land on the north side of 23rd Street, between Twelfth and Eleventh Avenues, was acquired by the Commissioner of Docks and Ferries. The land was transferred to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1915, becoming a public park called the Thomas F. Smith Park, later the Chelsea Waterside Park. In 2000, the westernmost block of 23rd Street was demolished as part of a reorganization of traffic patterns and an expansion of the park. The expanded park contains a dog run, children&#x27;s playground, basketball court, and soccer green.

Just west of Tenth Avenue, the street passes under the High Line, a elevated linear park built on the structure of the former West Side Line railroad. The High Line contains both a staircase and an elevator entrance from 23rd Street.

On the north side of 23rd Street, just west of the High Line, is &quot;HL23&quot;, a residential building that hangs over the narrow linear park. London Terrace is located across Tenth Avenue, occupying the full block to Ninth Avenue between 23rd and 24th Streets.

The Hotel Chelsea, New York City&#x27;s first co-op apartment complex, was built at 222 West 23rd Street in 1883. The Emunah Israel synagogue, built in the 1860s as a Presbyterian church, is located a few doors to the west at 236 West 23rd.

The block of 23rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues is part of the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District. Designated a New York City landmark in May 1989, it is an irregularly-shaped district consisting of 440 buildings on 28 blocks and parts of blocks, from roughly 15th Street to 24th Street and from Park Avenue South to west of Sixth Avenue.

===East 23rd Street===
East 23rd Street, which runs between Fifth Avenue and the East River (FDR Drive), is one of the main thoroughfares of Gramercy Park.

The 22-story Flatiron Building is located on the south side of East 23rd Street at the street&#x27;s intersection with Fifth Avenue and Broadway, occupying the triangular parcel bounded by these two avenues and 22nd Street. The origin of the term &quot;23 skidoo&quot; is said to be from wind gusts caused by the building&#x27;s triangular shape or hot air from a shaft through which immense volumes of air escaped, producing gusts that supposedly lifted women&#x27;s skirts.

The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife), headquartered at 1 Madison Avenue at East 23rd Street, played a significant role in shaping the character of development along East 23rd Street in the early 20th century, constructing six buildings successively along the street and around the block to the corner of 24th. The tallest of these is the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, built in 1909 at the intersection of 24th Street and Madison Avenue. The tower, with its ornate clocktower faces, was one of Manhattan&#x27;s first skyscrapers. For four years, until the construction of the Woolworth Building in 1913, it was the tallest building in the world. It also owned a building across the street, which was the location of the 23rd Street Fire that killed 12 firemen. A new apartment building, the current Madison Green, was announced for the site in the 1970s, but the building itself was not constructed until 1982.

Another skyscraper on the street, the sixty-story, One Madison, was built in 2013. Media mogul Rupert Murdoch bought One Madison&#x27;s top four floors for $57 million.

The Woman&#x27;s Press Club of New York City was located at 126 East 23rd Street. It existed from 1889 to 1980 as an organization for female journalists and authors.

A large hospital run by the Veterans Health Administration, the Manhattan Campus of the VA NY Harbor Healthcare System, is located at 423 East 23rd Street, near the northeast corner of the intersection with First Avenue.

Near 23rd Street&#x27;s eastern end is the Asser Levy Public Baths. Built at the beginning of the 20th century, the baths were named after Asser Levy, one of the city&#x27;s first Jewish settlers. In 1980, the baths were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Stuyvesant Cove Park is located across FDR Drive, along the East River coast. Stretching south to 18th Street, the public space is built on the site of a concrete plant and parking lot. The street ends at the New York Skyports Seaplane Base, which opened in 1962. The seaplane base, which is part of a marina, also contains a parking lot whose entrance and exit is located at the eastern end of 23rd Street.

On the south side of East 23rd between First Avenue and Avenue C, Peter Cooper Village was one of MetLife&#x27;s experiments in middle-income community building until it was bought by Tishman Speyer. Peter Cooper Village was a sister project to MetLife&#x27;s Stuyvesant Town, which was built across 20th Street to the south.

== History ==
23rd Street was designated in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which established the Manhattan street grid, as one of 15 east-west streets that would be in width, as opposed to minor side streets that were designated as in width. The plan also reserved the of land bounded by 23rd Street, Third Avenue, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue as the &quot;Grand Parade&quot;, an area upon which development was prohibited. Instead, the area was to be used as an open space for military training, as well as an assembly point in the event the city was invaded. At the time, some thought that the Grand Parade might become a &quot;central park&quot; for the city, but the grounds were gradually reduced over the course of time. By 1847, the open area was , comprising the land of the current Madison Square Park.

=== Transport infrastructure ===
By the middle of the 19th century, there was a railroad, the Hudson (later West Side) Line, running from the current Hudson Yards area between 30th and 32nd Streets south to Chambers Street. At the time, the city prohibited steam locomotives from operating below 30th Street because of the risk of the train&#x27;s steam boiler exploding, so passengers from points north were forced to switch to horse-drawn trains. The horse-drawn line&#x27;s stops were located at 23rd, 14th, Christopher and Chambers Streets.

The West Side Line caused so many accidents between freight trains and other traffic that the nickname &quot;Death Avenue&quot; was given to Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. In 1929 the city, the state, and New York Central agreed on the West Side Improvement Project, a project that eliminated 105 street-level railroad crossings and cost more than US$150 million (about US$ today). A viaduct, the High Line, replaced the street-level tracks and was dedicated on June 29, 1934. The growth of interstate trucking during the 1950s led to a drop in rail traffic throughout the United States, and the viaduct was effectively abandoned in 1980.

The Twenty-third Street Railway, a street railway originally operated as horse cars and later electric traction, was chartered on January 29, 1872. In 1893, the Twenty-third Street Railway was leased to the Houston, West Street and Pavonia Ferry Railroad, which in turn was consolidated into the Metropolitan Street Railway on December 12, 1893. The Metropolitan Street Railway was leased by the Interurban Street Railway on April 1, 1902, and the latter went bankrupt six years later. The Metropolitan Street Railway separated on July 31, 1908, becoming the 23rd Street crosstown bus route. Originally called the M18-15 and then the M26, the route was renamed the M23 in 1989.

During the 1870s, the Sixth Avenue Elevated was built, significantly increasing the number of customers who shopped at stores along the route. Elevated lines with stations on 23rd Street were also constructed along Ninth Avenue in 1867, Third Avenue in 1878, and Second Avenue in 1880. By the middle of the 20th century, they were all demolished. Several New York City Subway stations now serve 23rd Street (see ).

In 1869, Pavonia Ferry opened a terminal on the shore of the Hudson River at Pier 63, which aligned with the western end of 23rd Street. The ferries traveled to Jersey City, located opposite Manhattan. By the beginning of the 20th century ferries were already aging and deteriorating under heavy use, and in 1942 the terminal itself was demolished. In the late 1980s, boat enthusiast John Krevey converted an old railroad barge on the Hudson River to a floating jetty called Pier 63. A restaurant was opened on the pier. The lightship &quot;Frying Pan&quot; and the fire vessel &quot;John J. Harvey&quot; were also originally moored to Pier 63, with both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, the barge was moved to Pier 66 on 26th Street.

=== Historical architecture ===
On January 1, 1825, the New York House of Refuge, a jail for juvenile delinquents, opened on Broadway between 22nd and 23rd Streets. The jail housed prisoners up to 16 years old who were serving long jail sentences, including boys who were being imprisoned until at least age 21 and girls until at least age 18. During the first 10 years, the jail held 1,120 prisoners. In 1854, the prison moved to Randall&#x27;s Island in the East River.

A collection of four-story houses called London Terrace was built on the block bounded by 23rd Street, 24th Streets, Ninth Avenue, and Tenth Avenue in 1845. London Terrace was rebuilt in 1930, with the houses being replaced with 14 apartment buildings that each had sixteen to eighteen floors. The new complex had a total of 1,670 apartments, housing 5,000 total residents. At the time of construction it was the largest residential complex in the city.

In 1857, the merchant Amos Eno bought a land parcel at the intersection with Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street. He built the luxury Fifth Avenue Hotel on this site by 1859. The six-story-high structure, which was designed to accommodate 800 guests, became the largest hotel in the world at that time. The hotel served as the headquarters of the Republican Party and was used by Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Chester A. Arthur. When the Prince of Wales, Edward VII, visited the hotel in 1860, the commercial appeal of the adjacent neighborhood was greatly increased. The area bounded by 14th and 23rd Streets between Sixth Avenue and Broadway was soon dubbed Ladies&#x27; Mile. In 1908, the hotel was demolished and replaced by the Toy Center.

By about 1860, Irish immigrants had displaced African-Americans living in Five Points, the latter of whom later resettled all over Manhattan. A thousand African-Americans eventually settled in an area bordered by 23rd Street on the south, 40th Street on the north, and Sixth Avenue on the east.

The National Academy of Design building opened in 1863 at the intersection of 23rd Street and Fourth (now Park) Avenue. The building was designed by Peter Bonnett Wight in a style evocative of Doge&#x27;s Palace in Venice. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, it had been demolished and replaced with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower.

In 1878, the Stern Brothers department store opened between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The building, designed by Henry Fernbach, was massive by contemporary standards, standing seven stories high and measuring wide. It became one of the largest cast-iron structures in New York City.

A second notable hotel on the street, the Hotel Chelsea, was built between 1883 and 1885, with the first portions opening in 1884. It was New York&#x27;s tallest building until 1902. Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen lived in the Hotel Chelsea from August 1978. The building has been a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977.

The emergence of many new hotels after the American Civil War contributed to the increase of prostitution in the area. By 1876, there were so many brothels in the area bounded by 23rd and 57th Streets, between Fifth and Seventh Avenues, that New York City Police Department captain Alexander S. Williams nicknamed this strip of land &quot;Tenderloin&quot;. Referring to the increased number of bribes he would receive for police protection of both legitimate and illegitimate businesses there – especially the many brothels – Williams said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been having chuck steak ever since I&#x27;ve been on the force, and now I&#x27;m going to have a bit of tenderloin.&quot;

=== Theaters ===
There were several Broadway and Off-Broadway theaters being built along West 23rd Street beginning in the late 19th century. By the turn of the century, the street contained a &quot;Theater Row&quot;, which was a prominent fixture in American theater. 23rd Street remained New York&#x27;s main theater strip until the Empire Theatre opened on Broadway some twenty blocks uptown, ushering in a new era of theater.

In 1868, Pike&#x27;s Opera House (later the Grand Opera House) was built at Eighth Avenue and 23rd Street for several million dollars. The film company RKO Pictures converted the building into a movie theater in 1938. By 1960, it was demolished to make room for the Penn South residential complex.

Booth&#x27;s Theatre was opened in 1869 at the intersection with Sixth Avenue. It was sold in 1881 for half the cost of its construction, becoming a dry-goods store.

In 1889, the entrepreneur Frederick Freeman Proctor opened Proctor&#x27;s Theatre, a theater between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. Proctor used innovations such as electric lighting and phonographs in his &quot;continuous daily vaudeville&quot; theater. In 1907, the theater was converted to an RKO cinema, and 30 years later, it was destroyed in a fire. During the late 19th century, Bryant&#x27;s Minstrels also performed a minstrel show in Proctor&#x27;s Theatre.

Modern theaters include the Chelsea Bow Tie Cinemas, on the south side of West 23rd between Seventh and Eighth Avenues; the SVA Theatre, operated by the School of Visual Arts on the north side of West 23rd one block west; and the Cell Theatre, across the street from the SVA Theatre.

=== Educational institutions ===
In 1849, James Renwick Jr. constructed the Free Academy Building for the City College of New York, following a statewide referendum two years prior that had allowed the construction of the school. The Gothic Revival building was located at the intersection of Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street. The building was demolished in 1928.

Baruch College, an institution within the City University of New York system, was a successor to the Free Academy. Founded by businessman and City College alumnus Bernard Baruch, the campus includes the Lawrence and Eris Field Building at the southeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 23rd Street in Gramercy. The 16-story building, opened in 1929, is the oldest structure that is part of Baruch College.

The New York Public Library contains two branches on the different portions of 23rd Street: the Muhlenberg branch on West 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue, and the Epiphany branch on East 23rd Street west of Second Avenue. The Epiphany branch, which is located in Gramercy/Kips Bay, opened in 1887 and moved to its current location, a Carnegie library on 23rd Street, in 1907. It was renovated from 1982 to 1984. The Muhlenberg branch, also a Carnegie library, opened in Chelsea in 1906 and was renovated in 2000.

=== Incidents ===
On October 17, 1966, the street was the location of New York&#x27;s deadliest fire until the September 11 attacks, in terms of firefighters killed. The &quot;23rd Street Fire&quot;, as it came to be called, began in a cellar at 7 East 22nd Street and soon spread to the basement of 6 East 23rd Street, a five-story commercial building that housed a drugstore at street level. Twelve firefighters were killed; two chiefs, two lieutenants, and six firefighters plunged into the flaming cellar, while two more firefighters were killed by the blast of flame and heat on the first floor.

<text>David Henry Gambrell (December 20, 1929 – May 6, 2021) was an American attorney who represented Georgia in the United States Senate from 1971 through 1972.

==Education and legal career==
Gambrell was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 20, 1929, the son of Kathleen (Hagood) and Smythe Gambrell. He graduated from Davidson College in 1949, and received his JD, with honors, from Harvard Law School in 1952. He served in the reserves of the United States Army. After serving as a Teaching Fellow at Harvard and then as an associate and partner at the King &amp; Spalding law firm in Atlanta, Gambrell founded Gambrell &amp; Stolz, LLP in 1963. He served as president of the Atlanta Bar Association from 1965 to 1966, and as president of the State Bar of Georgia from 1967 to 1968. He also served in the American Bar Association House of Delegates, on the Board of Editors of the &quot;ABA Journal&quot;, and as Director of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association. In 2002, he received the State Bar of Georgia&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award, and the Atlanta Bar Association, in 2007, honored him with their Leadership Award.

==Political career==
Gambrell went on to take part in state politics, serving as chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party from 1970–1971. In 1971, upon the death of Richard Russell Jr., Governor Jimmy Carter appointed Gambrell to the United States Senate, where he served during the years 1971 and 1972. While in the U.S. Senate he served as a member of the Banking Committee, Aeronautics and Space Committee, and Senate Select Committee on Small Business. Gambrell, a moderate, was defeated in the Democratic primary runoff in 1972 by the more conservative Sam Nunn, who went on to serve in the Senate for the next twenty-four years. Gambrell sought the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1974, but fared badly, finishing behind Lester Maddox, George Busbee (the eventual winner), and Bert Lance.

==Other activities==
Gambrell served in a number of public, business and civic roles, including the Directorships of three publicly held corporations, the Visiting Committees of Davidson College, Harvard Law School, Emory University and the Board of Directors of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He also served as Chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Committee on Post-Secondary Education, as chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Education Article of the Georgia Constitution, as a member on the Board of Curators of the Georgia Historical Society and as a trustee of the Lawyers Foundation of Georgia. He retired as a director of American Software, Inc. and was a trustee of the Georgia Legal History Foundation.

==Personal life==
Gambrell was married to Luck Flanders Gambrell. They had four children. She was a philanthropist in her hometown of Swainsboro, Georgia, having donated of land to establish East Georgia State College in 1971; the building housing the college&#x27;s library bears her name to honor this gift. Luck died on June 29, 2015. Gambrell died on May 6, 2021, after a period of declining health.

<doc id="952907" wikidata="Q1161138" url="?curid=952907" title="Incipit">
<text>The incipit ( ) of a text is the first few words of the text, employed as an identifying label. In a musical composition, an incipit is an initial sequence of notes, having the same purpose. The word &quot;incipit&quot; comes from Latin and means &quot;it begins&quot;. Its counterpart taken from the ending of the text is the explicit.

Before the development of titles, texts were often referred to by their incipits, as with for example &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;. During the medieval period in Europe, incipits were often written in a different script or colour from the rest of the work of which they were a part, and &quot;incipit pages&quot; might be heavily decorated with illumination. Though the word &quot;incipit&quot; is Latin, the practice of the incipit predates classical antiquity by several millennia and can be found in various parts of the world. Although not always called by the name of &quot;incipit&quot; today, the practice of referring to texts by their initial words remains commonplace.

==Historical examples==

===Sumerian===
In the clay tablet archives of Sumer, catalogs of documents were kept by making special catalog tablets containing the incipits of a given collection of tablets.

The catalog was meant to be used by the very limited number of official scribes who had access to the archives, and the width of a clay tablet and its resolution did not permit long entries. An example from Lerner (1998):

===Hebrew===
Many books in the Hebrew Bible are named in Hebrew using incipits. For instance, the first book (Genesis) is called &quot;Bereshit&quot; (&quot;In the beginning ...&quot;) and Lamentations, which begins &quot;How lonely sits the city...&quot;, is called &quot;Eykha&quot; (&quot;How&quot;). A readily recognized one is the &quot;Shema&quot; or &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot; in the Torah: &quot;Hear O Israel...&quot; – the first words of the proclamation encapsulating Judaism&#x27;s monotheism (see beginning Deuteronomy 6:4 and elsewhere).

All the names of Parashot are incipits, the title coming from a word, occasionally two words, in its first two verses. The first in each book is, of course, called by the same name as the book as a whole.

Some of the Psalms are known by their incipits, most noticeably Psalm 51 (Septuagint numbering: Psalm 50), which is known in Western Christianity by its Latin incipit &quot;Miserere&quot; (&quot;Have mercy&quot;).

In the Talmud, the chapters of the Gemara are titled in print and known by their first words, e.g. the first chapter of Mesekhet Berachot (&quot;Benedictions&quot;) is called Me-ematai (&quot;From when&quot;). This word is printed at the head of every subsequent page within that chapter of the tractate.

In rabbinic usage, the incipit is known as the &quot;dibur ha-matḥil&quot; (דיבור המתחיל), or &quot;beginning phrase&quot;, and refers to a section heading in a published monograph or commentary that typically, but not always, quotes or paraphrases a classic biblical or rabbinic passage to be commented upon or discussed.

Many religious songs and prayers are known by their opening words.

Sometimes an entire monograph is known by its &quot;dibur hamatḥil&quot;. The published mystical and exegetical discourses of the Chabad-Lubavitch rebbes (called &quot;ma&#x27;amarim&quot;), derive their titles almost exclusively from the &quot;dibur ha-matḥil&quot; of the individual work&#x27;s first chapter.

===Ancient Greek===

The final book of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation, is often known as the Apocalypse after the first word of the original Greek text, &quot;apokalypsis&quot; &quot;revelation&quot;, to the point where that word has become synonymous with what the book describes, i.e. the End of Days ( &quot;eschaton&quot; &quot;[the] last&quot; in the original).

=== Classical Arabic ===
Each chapter in the Quran, with the exception of the ninth, begins with Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim -- meaning &quot;in the name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.&quot;

===Medieval Europe===
Incipits are generally, but not always, in red in medieval manuscripts. They may come before a miniature or an illuminated or historiated letter.

===Papal bulls===

Traditionally, papal bulls and encyclicals, documents issued under the authority of the Pope, are referenced by their Latin incipit.

===Hindu texts===
Some of the mantras, suktas from the hymns of the Vedas, conform to this usage.

==Modern uses of incipits==

The idea of choosing a few words or a phrase or two, which would be placed on the spine of a book and its cover, developed slowly with the birth of printing, and the idea of a title page with a short title and subtitle came centuries later, replacing earlier, more verbose titles.

The modern use of standardized titles, combined with the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), have made the incipit obsolete as a tool for organizing information in libraries.

However, incipits are still used to refer to untitled poems, songs, and prayers, such as Gregorian chants, operatic arias, many prayers and hymns, and numerous poems, including those of Emily Dickinson. That such a use is an incipit and not a title is most obvious when the line breaks off in the middle of a grammatical unit (e.g., Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 55 &quot;Not marble, nor the gilded monuments&quot;).

Latin legal concepts are often designated by the first few words, for example, &quot;habeas corpus&quot; for &quot;habeas corpus ad subjiciendum&quot; (&quot;may you have the person to be subjected [to examination]&quot;) which are itself the key words of a much longer writ.

Many word processors propose the first few words of a document as a default file name, assuming that the incipit may correspond to the intended title of the document.

The space-filling, or place-holding, text lorem ipsum is known as such from its incipit.

Occasionally, incipits have been used for humorous effect, such as in the Alan Plater-written television series &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; and its sequels, in which each episode is named for the first words spoken in the episode (leading to episode titles such as &quot;What I don&#x27;t understand is this...&quot; and &quot;Um...I know what you&#x27;re thinking&quot;).

==In music==
Musical incipits are printed in standard music notation. They typically feature the first few bars of a piece, often with the most prominent musical material written on a single staff (the examples given at right show both the single-staff and full-score incipit variants). Incipits are especially useful in music because they can call to mind the reader&#x27;s own musical memory of the work where a printed title would fail to do so. Musical incipits appear both in catalogs of music and in the tables of contents of volumes that include multiple works.

In choral music, sacred or secular pieces from before the 20th century were often titled with the incipit text. For instance, the proper of the Catholic Mass and the Latin transcriptions of the biblical psalms used as prayers during services are always titled with the first word or words of the text. Protestant hymns of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are also traditionally titled with an incipit.

==In computer science==

In computer science, long strings of characters may be referred to by their incipits, particularly encryption keys or product keys. Notable examples include FCKGW (used by Windows XP) and 09 F9 (used by Advanced Access Content System).

<text>The tooltip, also known as infotip or hint, is a common graphical user interface (GUI) element in which, when hovering over a screen element or component, a text box displays information about that element, such as a description of a button&#x27;s function, what an abbreviation stands for, or the exact absolute time stamp over a relative time (&quot;… ago&quot;). In common practice, the tooltip is displayed continuously as long as the user hovers over the element or the text box provided by the tool. It is sometimes possible for the mouse to hover within the text box provided to activate a nested tooltip, and this can continue to any depth, often with multiple text boxes overlapped.

On desktop, it is used in conjunction with a cursor, usually a pointer, whereby the tooltip appears when a user hovers the pointer over an item without clicking it.
On touch-screen devices, a tooltip is displayed upon long-pressing—i.e., tapping and holding—an element. Some smartphones have alternative input methods such as a stylus, which can show tooltips when hovering above the screen.

A common variant of tooltips, especially in older software, is displaying a description of the tool in a status bar. Microsoft&#x27;s tooltips feature found in its end-user documentation is named ScreenTips. Apple&#x27;s tooltips feature found in its developer documentation is named help tags. The Classic Mac OS uses a tooltips feature, though in a slightly different way, known as balloon help. Some software and applications, such as GIMP, provide an option for users to turn off some or all tooltips. However, such options are left to the discretion of the developer, and are often not implemented.

== Origin ==

The term &quot;tooltip&quot; originally came from older Microsoft applications (e.g. Microsoft Word 95). These applications would have toolbars wherein, when moving the mouse over the Toolbar icons, displayed a short description of the function of the tool in the toolbar. More recently, these tooltips are used in various parts of an interface, not only on toolbars.

== Examples ==
CSS, HTML, and JavaScript also other coding systems allow web designers to create customized tooltips.

Demonstrations of tooltip usage are prevalent on web pages. Many graphical web browsers display the codice_1 attribute of an HTML element as a tooltip when a user hovers the pointer over that element; in such a browser, when hovering over Wikipedia images and hyperlinks a tooltip will appear.

<doc id="952910" wikidata="Q17008077" url="?curid=952910" title="Liberalism in Slovenia">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Slovenia]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==History==
After the independence of Slovenia former young socialists claim to have restarted the liberal tradition of former Austria-Hungary. Their organized liberalism became a major political force. The Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (&quot;Liberalna demokracija Slovenije&quot;, becomes a member of the LI and the ELDR) and profiles itself as a left of center liberal party. Others argue that there have been no liberal parties in Slovenia since independence in 1991. They say that claims of the former communist youth (ZSMS) and LDS that they represent liberal parties with liberal doctrines are political propaganda and that facts demonstrate that both ZSMS and LDS followed socialist and anti liberal policies.

===From National Party of Carniola to Democratic Party===
*1894: Ivan Tavčar led the Young Slovenes to establish the National Party of Carniola (&quot;Narodna stranka za Krajnsko&quot;). In Gorizia related groups formed the National Progressive Party in 1900
*1905: The Carniolan party is renamed National Progressive Party (&quot;Narodno napredna stranka&quot;). In Upper Styria related groups formed the National Party of Styria (&quot;Narodna stranka za Štajersko&quot;)
*1918: The three party merged into the Yugoslav Democratic Party (&quot;Jugoslovanska demokratska stranka&quot;)
*1919: The party merged with Serbian and Croatian into the pan-Yugoslav more or less liberal State Party of Serbian, Croatian and Slovene Democrats (&quot;Državnotvorna stranka demokrata Srba, Hrvata i Slovenaca&quot;). Some of the Slovene liberals did not join JDS and founded Independent Agrarian Party (&quot;Samostojna kmetijska stranka&quot;) and National-Socialist Party (&quot;Narodno-socialistična stranka&quot;). Except the name, the latter did not have much in common with German Nazis and could have been described as a social liberal party.

*1931: Slovene liberals leaders joined the government party (&quot;Yugoslav Radical-Peasant Democracy&quot; - &quot;Jugoslovenska radikalno-kmečka demokracija&quot;), from 1934 Yugoslav National Party (&quot;Jugoslovenska nacionalna stranka&quot;). *1935-1941: JNS was in opposition.
*1941-1945: Following the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, political parties were dissolved but continued activities in underground. Facing the communist insurgence, Slovene liberals co-founded the underground national organization Slovene Covenant (&quot;Slovenska zaveza&quot;).

<text>A beer hall () is a large pub that specializes in beer. 

==Germany==
Beer halls are a traditional part of Bavarian culture, and feature prominently in Oktoberfest. Bosch notes that the beer halls of Oktoberfest, known in German as &quot;Festzelte&quot;, are more properly termed &quot;beer tents&quot;, as they are large, temporary structures built in the open air. In Munich alone, the &quot;Festzelte&quot; of Oktoberfest can accommodate over 100,000 people.

Bavaria&#x27;s capital Munich is the city most associated with beer halls; almost every brewery in Munich operates a beer hall. The largest beer hall, the 5,000-seat Mathäser, near the Munich central station, has been converted into a movie theater.

The Bürgerbräukeller in Munich lent its name to the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch, an attempted Nazi coup led by Adolf Hitler.

==United States==
American beer halls became popular in the mid-19th century, following a wave of immigration from Germany to the United States. They became an alternative to the American-style tavern.

St. Louis, Missouri is home to a number of beer halls, some of which seat several hundred persons. Hofbräuhaus has eight franchised beer halls in the United States.

The Loerzel Beer Hall was built around 1873 in Saugerties, Ulster County, New York, and was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is currently an apartment building.

German brewers who immigrated to Milwaukee, Wisconsin built &quot;hundreds of distinctive taverns and beer halls&quot;, and also built and established large outdoor beer gardens.

<doc id="952915" wikidata="Q216715" url="?curid=952915" title="Mean anomaly">
<text>In celestial mechanics, the mean anomaly is the fraction of an elliptical orbit&#x27;s period that has elapsed since the orbiting body passed periapsis, expressed as an angle which can be used in calculating the position of that body in the classical two-body problem. It is the angular distance from the pericenter which a fictitious body would have if it moved in a circular orbit, with constant speed, in the same orbital period as the actual body in its elliptical orbit.

==Definition==
Define as the time required for a particular body to complete one orbit. In time , the radius vector sweeps out 2 radians, or 360°. The average rate of sweep, , is then 

formula_1 

which is called the &quot;mean angular motion&quot; of the body, with dimensions of radians per unit time or degrees per unit time.

Define as the time at which the body is at the pericenter. From the above definitions, a new quantity, , the &quot;mean anomaly&quot; can be defined 

formula_2 

which gives an angular distance from the pericenter at arbitrary time with dimensions of radians or degrees.

Because the rate of increase, , is a constant average, the mean anomaly increases uniformly (linearly) from 0 to 2 radians or 0° to 360° during each orbit. It is equal to 0 when the body is at the pericenter, radians (180°) at the apocenter, and 2 radians (360°) after one complete revolution. If the mean anomaly is known at any given instant, it can be calculated at any later (or prior) instant by simply adding (or subtracting) where represents the small time difference.

Mean anomaly does not measure an angle between any physical objects (except at pericenter or apocenter, or for a circular orbit). It is simply a convenient uniform measure of how far around its orbit a body has progressed since pericenter. The mean anomaly is one of three angular parameters (known historically as &quot;anomalies&quot;) that define a position along an orbit, the other two being the eccentric anomaly and the true anomaly.

===Mean anomaly at epoch===
The &quot;mean anomaly at epoch&quot;, , is defined as the instantaneous mean anomaly at a given epoch, . This value is sometimes provided with other orbital elements to enable calculations of the object&#x27;s past and future positions along the orbit. The epoch for which is defined is often determined by convention in a given field or discipline. For example, planetary ephemerides often define for the epoch J2000, while for earth orbiting objects described by a two-line element set the epoch is specified as a date in the first line.

==Formulae==
The mean anomaly can be computed from the eccentric anomaly and the eccentricity with Kepler&#x27;s equation:

formula_3

Mean anomaly is also frequently seen as

formula_4

where is the mean anomaly at the epoch , which may or may not coincide with , the time of pericenter passage. The classical method of finding the position of an object in an elliptical orbit from a set of orbital elements is to calculate the mean anomaly by this equation, and then to solve Kepler&#x27;s equation for the eccentric anomaly.

Define as the &quot;longitude of the pericenter&quot;, the angular distance of the pericenter from a reference direction. Define as the &quot;mean longitude&quot;, the angular distance of the body from the same reference direction, assuming it moves with uniform angular motion as with the mean anomaly. Thus mean anomaly is also
:formula_5

Mean angular motion can also be expressed,

formula_6

where is the gravitational parameter, which varies with the masses of the objects, and is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Mean anomaly can then be expanded,

formula_7

and here mean anomaly represents uniform angular motion on a circle of radius .

Mean anomaly can be calculated from the eccentricity and the true anomaly by finding the eccentric anomaly and then using Kepler&#x27;s equation. This gives, in radians:
formula_8
where atan2(y, x) is the angle from the x-axis of the ray from (0, 0) to (x, y), having the same sign as y.

For parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories the mean anomaly is not defined, because they don&#x27;t have a period. But in those cases, as with elliptical orbits, the area swept out by a chord between the attractor and the object following the trajectory increases linearly with time. For the hyperbolic case, there is a formula similar to the above giving the elapsed time as a function of the angle (the true anomaly in the elliptic case), as explained in the article Kepler orbit. For the parabolic case there is a different formula, the limiting case for either the elliptic or the hyperbolic case as the distance between the foci goes to infinity – see Parabolic trajectory#Barker&#x27;s equation.

Mean anomaly can also be expressed as a series expansion:
formula_9

with formula_10

formula_11

A similar formula gives the true anomaly directly in terms of the mean anomaly:

formula_12

A general formulation of the above equation can be written as the equation of the center: 

formula_13

<text>Assay offices are institutions set up to assay (test the purity of) precious metals. This is often done to protect consumers from buying fake items. Upon successful completion of an assay (i.e. if the metallurgical content is found be equal or better than that claimed by the maker and it otherwise conforms to the prevailing law) the assay offices typically stamp a hallmark on the item to certify its metallurgical content. Hallmarking first appeared in France, with the Goldsmiths&#x27; Statute of 1260 promulgated under Étienne Boileau, Provost of Paris, for King Louis IX.

== US assay offices ==
Title 15, Chapter 8, Section 291 of the United States Code makes it unlawful to stamp goods in the United States with &quot;United States assay&quot; or any similar stamp which gives the impression that the item has been officially assayed by the United States government.

=== General overview and function of U.S. assay offices ===
Assay offices did and do exist in the U.S., but they are affiliated with the government&#x27;s coinage mints and serve only the government&#x27;s purposes in that field. They are not involved in hallmarking, as there has never been a hallmarking scheme in the U.S.

In the 1800s, the functions of assay offices in the U.S. included receiving bullion deposits from the public and from mining prospectors in the various American territories. The assay offices that still operate today function solely within national coining system (including bullion coinage for sales to investors).

=== US assay offices, current ===
Current U.S. assay offices include the following:

* The Philadelphia Mint – 1792 to date
* The Denver Mint – 1862 to date. It served as an assay office until 1906, when coinage operations began.
* The San Francisco Mint – 1852 to date. Coinage operations were suspended in March 1955, but the plant continued to operate as an assay office. In 1962, its official designation was changed from mint to assay office. Coinage operations were again authorized in 1965.
* The West Point, New York Bullion Depository – 1938 to date. It is operated as an adjunct of the New York Assay Office.

=== US assay offices, historical ===
* The Charlotte, North Carolina Mint – 1835 to 1861. After the Civil War, the plant was reopened in 1868 as an assay office until 1913, when it was ultimately closed.
* The New Orleans, Louisiana Mint – 1835 to 1942. Coinage operations were conducted here from 1838, but were suspended from 1861 until 1879; assay functions were performed from 1876. Coinage resumed in 1879 and continued until 1909. The facility operated as an assay office from 1909 until 1942, when it was closed.
* The U.S. Assay Office, St. Louis, Missouri – 1881 to 1911
* The U.S. Assay Office, Helena, Montana – 1874 to 1933
* The U.S. Assay Office, Salt Lake City, Utah – 1909 to 1933
* The U.S. Assay Office, Deadwood, South Dakota – 1898 to 1927
* The U.S. Assay Office, Boise, Idaho – 1869 to 1933
* The U.S. Assay Office, New York, New York – 1854 to 1982
* The U.S. Assay Office, Seattle, Washington – 1898 to 1955

== UK assay offices ==

=== General overview and function of UK assay offices ===
In the United Kingdom, the Hallmarking Act 1973 (c. 43) makes it an offence to describe as platinum, gold or silver an item which is not hallmarked as appropriate or exempt from hallmarking. In July 2009, following a proposal by the British Hallmarking Council, an amendment to the Act also brought palladium under the hallmarking regime.

The first UK assay office was Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall, founded around 1300, and where the term &quot;hallmarking&quot; originates, meaning &quot;marked in Goldsmiths&#x27; Hall&quot;. Since then, there have been ten assay offices in the UK.

There are four remaining assay offices in the UK:

===Current assay offices===
* London Assay Office
* Sheffield Assay Office
* Birmingham Assay Office
* Edinburgh Assay Office

===Historic assay offices===
* Chester (closed 24 August 1962)
* Dublin (1801-1922 part of UK system – see Dublin Assay Office)
* Exeter (closed 1883)
* Glasgow (closed 31 March 1964)
* Newcastle (closed 1884)
* Norwich (closed 1702)
* York (closed 1857)

==Irish assay office==
There is one assay office, the Dublin Assay Office.

==Dutch (Netherlands) assay office==

===General overview and function of the Dutch assay office===
The Dutch (the Netherlands), who are members of the International Hallmarking Convention, have been striking hallmarks since at least 1814, and boast a 600-year history of hallmarking in Dutch territories. Like many other nations, the Dutch require the registration and use of Responsibility Marks since 1797. The Dutch also use a date letter code.
After the French defeat at Leipzig 1813 the Kingdom of the Netherlands was established. William VI, prince of Orange (known in Dutch as Willem Frederik), was proclaimed the sovereign. On March 15, 1815, with the support of the powers gathered at the Congress of Vienna, William proclaimed himself King William I of the Netherlands. He was also made grand duke of Luxembourg. The two countries remained separate despite sharing a common monarch. For our purposes, he retained much of the French legislation, including the precious metal guarantee law of November 9, 1787. On December 26, 1813, the precious metal laws were however, modified and the French hallmarks, the Gaul cockerels were replaced with Dutch lions. The existing guarantee offices were reopened after re-staffing and the production of the new hallmark dies. Willem abdicated in 1840. As of January 1, 1853, the out-of-date French guarantee law was replaced by a new Dutch law. This law of September 18, 1852, in a modified form (last modified in 1986 as the &quot;Dutch Assay Law of 1986&quot;) is in still effective. As a result of the Benelux treaty the guarantee tax was abolished in 1953. At the same time gold and silver fineness standards were adapted to conform to international standards. Also the assaying of platinum was introduced in 1953.

In 1987, the assay system was privatized and since 1988 has been located in only an office at Gouda. The system is overseen by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs which appointed Edelmetaal Waarborg Nederland B.V. as of March 11, 2002. In 1999, the Netherlands ratified the Vienna Convention on the Control of the Fineness and the Hallmarking of Precious Metal Objects.

Dutch hallmarks are recognized in Austria, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom without further testing and have also been recognized in Belgium, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which have voluntary hallmarking systems. All jewelry produced in the Netherlands or imported for the Dutch market must carry hallmarks.

===Current assay office===
There are two Dutch assay offices located in the city of Gouda and Joure. The Dutch recognize platinum, gold, silver and palladium as precious metals.

===Historic Netherlands assay offices (up to 1988)===

== Swiss assay offices ==

===General overview and function of Swiss assay offices===
Only precious metal watch cases must be hallmarked in Switzerland. Swiss hallmarking for other articles such as jewelry and cutlery is optional. In addition to the Swiss hallmark, all precious metal goods may be stamped with the Common Control Mark of the Vienna Convention. Switzerland recognizes platinum, gold, silver and palladium as precious metals which may be hallmarked and thus are subject to assay.

===Current Swiss assay offices===
=== Historic Swiss assay offices ===
==Austrian assay office==
There is one assay office at Vienna.

==Cyprian assay office==
There is one assay office at Aradippou.
The Law governing the marking of precious metal articles has been ratified by the House of Representatives in 1991, creating a new semi-Governmental Organisation, the Cyprus Organisation for the Hallmarking of precious metals. The Cyprus Assay Office (CAO) is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. 
The Cyprus Hallmark consists of three compulsory symbols: 1. The manufacturer&#x27;s mark - Consists of the initials of the manufacturer of the article surrounded by a small shield; 2. The fineness mark - The purity of the metal, in parts per thousand; 3. The official mark - the Head of Aphrodite until December 2001 and a ship as from January 2002 denotes that the article is made of gold, and the fish that the article is made of silver. The manufacturer&#x27;s mark must be struck on the articles by the manufacturer before it is submitted to the Assay Office for hallmarking. The manufacturer may make arrangements for the manufacture&#x27;s mark to be struck by the Assay Office upon submission of the article to be struck with the approved hallmarks. 
The manufacturer&#x27;s mark which is registered under the relevant section of the law shall include the initial letters of the name or names of the manufacturer and shall be of such design as may be approved by the Assay Office. The standards of fineness of gold and silver articles that are hallmarked are for gold: 375, 585, 750 and 916 parts per thousand; for silver: 800, 830 and 925 parts per thousand; no negative tolerance is permitted on the above standards of fineness.

==The assay office of the Czech Republic==
There is one assay office in Praha.
Assay Office was established by the Czech National Council Law No. 19/1993 Coll., concerning 
the Administration Authorities of the Czech Republic in the Field of Hallmarking and Precious Metal Testing, from which the Assay Office competences and duties are resulting. The provision of the financing is included in the Law about Hallmarking and Precious Metal Testing (Hallmarking Act), No. 539/1992 Coll., and in the procedural Decree of the Federal Ministry of Economy (FME), No. 540/1992 Coll., according to which the Hallmarking Act is implemented.

==Swedish assay office==
The Swedish assay office, the SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden, is in Borås. The assay office is privatized and the concession, given to the Inspecta Corporation, is an independent, international qualification requirements fulfilling inspection, testing, measurement and certification services provider. Inspecta is accredited by SWEDAC.

== Bahrain assay office ==

The Directorate of Precious Metals &amp; Gemstone Testing is one of fourteen directorates forming the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. The directorate itself is composed of two sections that deal with assaying and gemmology and the three main functions of the directorate as a whole are:

1. Serving the trade and public with their gemmological and assaying needs.

2. Overseeing the local jewellery sector to ensure that traders adhere to national and international laws and nomenclature.

3. Protecting consumers and the trade from fraud within the market place.

The two sections of the Directorate deal with all aspects of gemmology and precious metal assaying and have existed for over a decade. The Assay Office was established in 1979 via Amiri Decree No.19 and the Gem &amp; Pearl Testing Laboratory followed in 1990 via Amiri Decree No. 10.

Both sections were amongst the first to be established in the Middle East and since their establishment they have developed a positive reputation within the Middle East and beyond.

== Japanese assay office ==

Japan has one assay office, situated at the Saitama branch of Japan Mint in Saitama Prefecture. Japan Mint has assayed and hallmarked from 1929, and the Saitama branch moved from Tokyo in 2016. Japanese hallmarking is optional. Gold, silver and platinum are subject to assay. The articles combined with the golden parts and the platinum parts are hallmarked with special marks.

<doc id="952923" wikidata="Q2374484" url="?curid=952923" title="Colne">
<text>Colne () is a market town and civil parish in the Borough of Pendle in Lancashire, England. The town is northeast of Nelson, northeast of Burnley and east of Preston.

The town should not be confused with the unrelated Colne Valley around the River Colne near Huddersfield in West Yorkshire.

Colne is close to the southern entrance to the Aire Gap, the lowest crossing of the Pennine watershed. The M65 terminates west of the town and from here two main roads take traffic onwards towards the Yorkshire towns of Skipton (A56) and Keighley (A6068). Colne railway station is the terminus of the East Lancashire railway line.

Colne adjoins the Pendle parishes of Foulridge, Laneshaw Bridge, Trawden Forest, Nelson, Barrowford and Blacko.

==History==
Settlement in the area can be traced back to the Stone Age. A Mesolithic camp site, a Bronze Age burial site and stone tools from the Bronze and Stone Ages have been discovered at nearby Trawden. There are also the remains of an Iron Age fort, dating from the 6th century BC, above Colne at Castercliff.

Although a Roman road passes through nearby Barnoldswick, and some Roman coins have been discovered, there is no conclusive evidence of the Romans having occupied the area. There is, however, some debate among local historians as to whether the Romans may have stayed at Castercliff.

From the early 6th century to the late 10th century, Colne came under Northumbrian and then Viking rule, finally coming firmly under Norman control in the 11th century. Then, from the 1090s until 1311, the area was controlled by the de Lacys of Pontefract from their outpost at Clitheroe Castle. Pendle Forest and Trawden Forest date from this period; forests in those times being hunting grounds for royals and other nobles. St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church dates from before 1122 when the town&#x27;s market was located in the churchyard. The churchyard used to house the market cross and wooden stocks on wheels and people were placed in these on market days. The stocks are now located in the nearby library. The market cross is in Market Street.

The town developed in two parts: Colne, on top of the ridge; and Waterside, at the base of the southern slope, next to Colne Water. By 1296, a corn mill and a fulling mill had been established down by the river. By the 15th century, Colne had become the main market town in the area with markets (latterly held on Tuesdays) and a major centre for the woollen trade, in particular for the production of lightweight kersey. With the Industrial Revolution, cotton manufacturing became the main industry in the town, fuelled by the completion of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1816, and by the arrival of the railway in 1848.

The cross allows a market to be held there and dates back to the 15th century. The market cross was originally at the junction of Colne Lane and Church Street. It was first moved to the grounds of The Gables on Albert Road, the location of Colne Library until around 1970. It has now been relocated to outside the Market Hall on Market Street, part of the main road through the town centre.

The rise of Chartism saw riots here over the imposition of the &#x27;new&#x27; police force in April and August 1840. John Halstead, a special constable, was killed by a mob armed with sharpened iron rails during the second. In both cases troops marched from Burnley Barracks and the violence ceased with their arrival.

Colne is on the edge of the Burnley Coalfield and coal was being mined at Fox Clough, to south of the town, from the early 17th century. Fox Clough Colliery also known as Engine Pit, was started by the Executors of John Hargreaves company, probably around 1832. By the 1840s a surface drift was located at the foot of the clough, on the south side of Colne Water, and a tramroad crossed the river connecting the colliery to a coal yard in the town. It seems the coal here was not of a high quality, as during the winter of 1860 a local newspaper reported that the frozen canal and diversion of railway wagons had forced the inhabitants of Colne, to resort to town&#x27;s coal pit. Fox Clough Colliery was abandoned in 1872, but Trawden Colliery (1874 - 1890), located about 200 metres up the valley, continued production from the same workings. The tramroad was marked as disused in 1893. By 1891 there were 30 cotton mills listed in Colne with more in the surrounding areas of Trawden and Laneshaw Bridge. The largest had 2,400 looms and the smallest 56.

==Governance==

Colne was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley which became a civil parish in 1866. A local board was formed in 1875, the district including part of Great Marsden, on the south side of Colne Water between Fox Clough and Swinden Clough. This area was made an urban district in 1894 and designated a Municipal Borough in 1895. In 1935 the borough absorbed an area to the east around Barnside, historically a detached part of Foulridge. 

In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Colne became part of the Borough of Pendle. Initially Colne formed part of an unparished area, in 1992 a new civil parish of Laneshaw Bridge was created from what had been the eastern side of the municipal borough. A new Colne civil parish was formed in 2008. A town council was re-established at that time; it meets in Colne Town Hall, which was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and opened in 1894.

After boundary changes in 2020 which reduced the number of wards in the borough to 12, three cover parts of Colne parish – Boulsworth &amp; Foulridge, Waterside &amp; Horsfield, and Vivary Bridge. The town is represented on Lancashire County Council in two divisions: Pendle Central and Pendle Rural.

The Member of Parliament for Pendle and Clitheroe, the constituency into which the town falls, is Jonathan Hinder (Labour), who was first elected in 2024.

==Demographics==

The town&#x27;s population declined during the 20th century, as was the case in many Lancashire mill towns, from 26,000 in 1911 to just 19,000 in 1961.

The United Kingdom Census 2011 showed a total resident population for Colne civil parish of 17,855. The town forms part of a wider urban area, which had a population of 149,796 in 2001. A similar but larger, Burnley Built-up area defined in the 2011 census had a population of 149,422.

The racial composition of the town in 2011 was 95.8% White (93.9% White British), 3.0% Asian, 0.1% Black, 0.9% Mixed and 0.1% Other. The largest religious groups were Christian (58.5%) and Muslim (2.5%). 68.5% of adults between the ages of 16 and 74 were classed as economically active and in work.

==Economy==

Colne&#x27;s former cotton industry has all but disappeared. Many of the textile weaving mills that used to punctuate the landscape have been demolished to make way for new retail outlets and modern housing. Others lie semi-derelict, but the best examples continue to provide jobs for local residents by accommodating new manufacturing and service businesses. Strong growth has been experienced in precision engineering, particularly associated with the aerospace sector, as Rolls-Royce Aerospace operates a large wide chord fan-blade manufacturing facility in nearby Barnoldswick.

The town&#x27;s main employment area is located at Whitewalls, which sits astride the boundary with Nelson adjacent to Junction 14 on the M65 motorway. To help stimulate development an undeveloped 5 hectare area of the estate was designated as part of the East Lancashire Enterprise Zone in December 1983 making it, at that time, the smallest Enterprise Zone in the country. This successful estate now extends to over 27 hectares and is home to a wide range businesses including a large abattoir. Walshaw House, the headquarters of the East Lancashire Primary Care Trust, which occupies a recent extension to the estate, reflects recent growth in the service sector.

The adjacent retail park contains a large ASDA supermarket and stores for Next and DFS. Boundary Mill Stores, one of the first factory outlets in the UK, was established here in 1983, but in 2008 it moved into purpose built premises closer to the end of the M65 motorway. In 2013, it is the borough&#x27;s largest employer, and has stores in Grantham, Newcastle, Walsall and Rotherham.

Another local success story was Lyon&#x27;s Tours, whose headquarters were off Albert Road, close to the town centre. A family-run business, in the 1950s it became one of the first UK tour operators to offer overseas holidays to its customers. The company became part of &quot;Airtours&quot; when David Crossland purchased a series of small travel agencies across Lancashire in 1972, which in turn merged with the Thomas Cook Group in June 2007.

==Landmarks==

Situated on the edge of the Pennines, Colne has views of several well-known hills. Boulsworth Hill, which lies on the boundary between Lancashire and West Yorkshire overlooks the town from the south. From the summit of Noyna Hill to the north, close to the village of Foulridge, it is possible to look out across much of East Lancashire and into the Yorkshire Dales. Blacko Tower (Stansfield Tower) is clearly visible to the north west, across White Moor, which forms the long eastern slope of Weets Hill.

The hamlet of Wycoller, off the road to Haworth, is the focus for the Country Park of the same name. Although traffic free (visitors must park outside the village), the peace and tranquility is often broken in the summer months as tourists are drawn to the visitor centre alongside the ruined hall. From here a network of footpaths and bridleways pass through the ford or cross Wycoller Beck on a series of ancient bridges, up to 1,000 years old. A series of circular walks traverse the lower slopes of Boulsworth Hill, whilst the long distance Bronte Way passes through en route to Haworth.

Colne is approximately 5 miles east of Pendle Hill, arguably the most well-known local landmark. Owing to its association with the Pendle witches, many local people walk up the hill, but particularly at Halloween. Several nearby farmhouses are reputed to be haunted, and have featured on the TV programmes &quot;Most Haunted&quot; and &quot;Most Haunted Live!&quot;
The town is also known for Wallace Hartley, bandmaster on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, to whom a memorial was erected, on Albert Road, in 1915. Wallace lived in Colne and is buried in the local cemetery.

==Transport==
Colne is connected to the national railway network. Colne railway station is  mile (1 km) west of the town centre. It forms the eastern terminus of the East Lancashire Line, which runs to Nelson, Brierfield, Burnley and on to Preston and Blackpool. The line beyond Colne, formerly part of the Midland Railway, was closed by British Rail in 1970, but since 2001 the Skipton–East Lancashire Rail Action Partnership (SELRAP) has petitioned for the reopening up of the line between Colne and Skipton, as yet without success.

The local bus company, Burnley &amp; Pendle, was part-owned until 1996 by the two borough councils. There are buses every few minutes during the daytime on the &#x27;Main Line&#x27; service between Burnley bus station and Colne town centre. Most of these then fork in various directions at each end, and continue to Padiham, Clitheroe or Accrington from Burnley, and to Earby, Barnoldswick, Trawden or Keighley from Colne. Until 2005 the town had a direct bus service to Manchester in the shape of route X43, but this was withdrawn following low usage, with the frequency along the Main Line routes improved to compensate. They also operate an hourly service between Skipton and Burnley via Colne.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes to the north-west of Colne. Beyond Barrowford Locks, barges enter the summit level and then the Foulridge Tunnel. Close to the western portal, water from three reservoirs built between 1793 and 1866 feed the summit level.

==Education==

===Colne Grammar School===
Colne Grammar School was a focus for education from the Middle Ages and had John Tillotson an Archbishop of Canterbury (1691–1694) amongst its alumni. Construction of the &#x27;new school&#x27; on Barrowford Road was completed 1941. It finally closed in the late 20th century when Nelson and Colne College, which then occupied the building, consolidated its operations on a site in nearby Barrowford. The red brick building, was converted to apartments in 2009 and now forms the centrepiece of an executive housing development known as The Locks.

===Pre-schools===
There are several pre-schools in the area which are spread across the town.

=== Primary schools ===
There are several primary schools in the Colne area, one of which is a Catholic school. The schools in the town are:
*Colne Lord Street Primary School
*West Street Community Primary School
*Sacred Heart Catholic school
*Colne Primet Primary School
*Colne Park Primary School
*Colne Christ Church Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School

Schools in the immediate area include:
*Foulridge St Michael and All Angels CofE Voluntary Aided Primary School
*Trawden Forest Primary School
*Laneshaw Bridge Primary School

For details of more schools around Colne see Foulridge, Trawden, Nelson, Laneshaw Bridge and Brierfield.

=== High schools ===
There are also three high schools in Colne: Colne Primet Academy, Park High School and Ss John Fisher and Thomas More RC High School.

===Colleges and further education===
Nelson and Colne College is the main provider of post-16 education in the area – there is no grammar school or continuing sixth form centre, the nearest being in Burnley and Skipton. Nelson and Colne College offers AS-level and A-level qualifications, as well as BTEC, City and Guilds, Open College of the North West and some professional qualifications. The college also has tie-ins with some higher education institutions.

==Religion==
St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, on Church Street, dates from before 1122 when the town&#x27;s market was located in the churchyard. In 1988 the church was designated a Grade I listed building by English Heritage. The Grade I listing is for buildings &quot;of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important&quot;.

Other churches and former churches in the town include the Church of England Christ Church (founded 1836), Holy Trinity Church and St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church; Mount Zion United Methodist Church and St John&#x27;s Methodist Church; Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church; the Salvation Army Hall on Market Place (now a Citizens Advice Bureau); and Trinity Baptist Church. Bethel Independent Methodist Church, dating from 1871, was the church of RMS Titanic&#x27;s bandmaster Wallace Hartley.

Church records exist for no fewer than thirty-four different places of worship and nine cemeteries.

==Sports and leisure==
Colne F.C., established in 1996, is the town&#x27;s football team; it currently plays in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division. Their predecessor at Holt House Stadium Colne Dynamoes F.C. received heavy investment from a local entrepreneur in the 1980s, but after winning the Northern Premier League crown in 1989/90 were refused entry to the Football Conference and folded before the start of the following season. Burnley F.C., which plays in the Premier League enjoys strong support in the town. The town also has a junior football club, Colne JFC, which runs teams for 8- to 16-year-olds, as well as a senior team.

Colne &amp; Nelson Rugby Union Football Club play at Holt House Playing Fields and the club celebrated its centenary in 2015. It runs two senior teams a Ladies&#x27; team and a massive Junior and Mini Colts section.

Colne Cricket Club was formed in 1830 and is the oldest cricket club in the Lancashire League. It has been a continuous member of the Lancashire League since 1890. The first games were played on the Horsfield, the same field that is used today.

Pendle Leisure Trust runs the Pendle Leisure Centre next to the railway station. The facility has two swimming pools, a fitness centre and gymnasium, sauna and sports hall. In summer 2013, the outdoor all-weather pitch was replaced by Urban Altitude. This outdoor aerial assault course is the first of its kind to be built in the UK in an urban location. It includes high and low rope courses, up to 42 ft off the ground, a 60m Zip-Wire, Leap of Faith, Power Fan Free-fall, Jacobs Ladder and Climbing Wall.

The nine-hole Colne Golf Club is located at Law Farm, to the north east of the town.

There are two large local parks: King George V Playing Fields on Skipton Road (A56) and Alkincoats Park, off the road between Colne and Barrowford (B6247). Alkincoats Park, once the estate of Alkincoats Hall, has bowling greens, hard surface tennis courts, pitch and put golf, a children&#x27;s play area and footpaths that lead to areas close to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the now-dismantled Colne to Skipton railway line. The towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the trackbed of the dismantled Colne to Skipton railway are also popular leisure destinations, as is Ballgrove Picnic Area at the eastern edge of Colne, close to Laneshaw Bridge. It is possible to walk from here to historic Wycoller.
There is an active sailing club at Lake Burwain one of the feeder lakes to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.

Since 2004, Colne has hosted the annual Colne Grand Prix cycle race, part of British Cycling&#x27;s Elite Circuit Series. The course follows an 800-metre circuit of the one-way road system around the town centre. In 2013, Olympic Gold medallist Ed Clancy MBE, representing Rapha Condor JLT, became the first repeat winner of the race.

Ralph, the father of the late Roger Bannister the first sub-four-minute miler in 1954, was born in Colne, the family having lived here for 400 years. &quot;Roger Bannister and the Four-minute Mile by John Bale&quot;

Every August bank holiday since 1989, the award-winning &quot;Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival&quot; has been hosted at venues throughout the town, attracting artists and visitors from across the world. Many local pubs and clubs stage music gigs; others hold &#x27;fringe&#x27; type performances. The larger events are staged at the Municipal Hall close to the town centre.

A second festival, the Colne Gala, has been held on every year (except two) for the past five decades; the first Gala being held in 1959. It begins with a parade through the town centre, which then proceeds towards Alkincoats Park and Holt House, where there are live events, a fairground, charity stalls and children&#x27;s attractions.

Colne also has a buoyant night-time economy, with a number of restaurants in the vicinity of its three theatres: the amateur-run Pendle Hippodrome Theatre; The Municipal Hall (&#x27;The Muni&#x27;), which hosts concerts, exhibitions and the annual pantomime, and the Little Theatre, home of Colne Dramatic Society.

==Media==
The area is served by television from ITV Granada and BBC North West. It is also served by radio from BBC Radio Lancashire, Capital Manchester and Lancashire which replaced 2BR in April 2019, and Pendle Community Radio, a community radio service aimed at the borough&#x27;s British Asian population.

A local newspaper, the Colne Times, a variant edition of the larger Burnley Express, is published on Fridays. A second midweek edition, the Pendle Express, aimed at both Colne and neighbouring Nelson, is published on Tuesdays. The town is also served by the Lancashire Telegraph, which publishes a Burnley, Pendle and Rossendale edition six days a week and by a weekly freesheet, the &#x27;Pendle Citizen&#x27;, which appears on Thursdays.

Colne along with the neighbouring town of Nelson are mentioned in the 1991 song, It&#x27;s Grim Up North by the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu.

<text>Hubert Lederer Dreyfus ( ; October 15, 1929 – April 22, 2017) was an American philosopher and a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. His main interests included phenomenology, existentialism and the philosophy of both psychology and literature, as well as the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence. He was widely known for his exegesis of Martin Heidegger, which critics labeled &quot;Dreydegger&quot;.

Dreyfus was featured in Tao Ruspoli&#x27;s film &quot;Being in the World&quot; (2010)&quot;,&quot; and was among the philosophers interviewed by Bryan Magee for the BBC Television series &quot;The Great Philosophers&quot; (1987)&quot;.&quot;

The &quot;Futurama&quot; character Professor &quot;Hubert&quot; Farnsworth is partly named after him, writer Eric Kaplan having been a former student.

==Life and career==
Dreyfus was born on 15 October 1929, in Terre Haute, Indiana, to Stanley S. and Irene (Lederer) Dreyfus.

He attended Harvard University from 1947. With a senior honors thesis on &quot;Causality and Quantum Theory&quot; (for which W. V. O. Quine was the main examiner) he was awarded a B.A. &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in 1951 and joined Phi Beta Kappa. He was awarded a M.A. in 1952. He was a Teaching Fellow at Harvard in 1952-1953 (as he was again in 1954 and 1956). Then, on a Harvard Sheldon traveling fellowship, Dreyfus studied at the University of Freiburg over 1953–1954. During this time he had an interview with Martin Heidegger. Sean D. Kelly records that Dreyfus found the meeting &#x27;disappointing.&#x27; Brief mention of it was made by Dreyfus during his 1987 BBC interview with Bryan Magee in remarks that are revealing of both his and Heidegger&#x27;s opinion of the work of Jean-Paul Sartre.

Between 1956 and 1957, Dreyfus undertook research at the Husserl Archives at the University of Louvain on a Fulbright Fellowship. Towards the end of his stay, his first (jointly authored) paper &quot;Curds and Lions in Don Quijote&quot; would appear in print. After acting as an instructor in philosophy at Brandeis University (1957–1959), he attended the Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris, on a French government grant (1959–1960).

From 1960, first as an instructor, then as an assistant and then associate professor, Dreyfus taught philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1964, with his dissertation &quot;Husserl&#x27;s Phenomenology of Perception&quot;, he obtained his Ph.D. from Harvard. (Due to his knowledge of Husserl, Dagfinn Føllesdal sat on the thesis committee but he has asserted that Dreyfus &quot;was not really my student.&quot;) That same year, his co-translation (with his first wife) of &quot;Sense and Non-Sense&quot; by Maurice Merleau-Ponty was published.

Also in 1964, and whilst still at MIT, he was employed as a consultant by the RAND Corporation to review the work of Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This resulted in the publication, in 1965, of the &quot;famously combative&quot; &quot;Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence&quot;, which proved to be the first of a series of papers and books attacking the AI field&#x27;s claims and assumptions. The first edition of &quot;What Computers Can&#x27;t Do&quot; would follow in 1972, and this critique of AI (which has been translated into at least ten languages) would establish Dreyfus&#x27;s public reputation. However, as the editors of his &quot;Festschrift&quot; noted: &quot;the study and interpretation of &#x27;continental&#x27; philosophers... came first in the order of his philosophical interests and influences.&quot;

=== Berkeley ===
In 1968, although he had been granted tenure, Dreyfus left MIT and became an associate professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, (winning, that same year, the Harbison Prize for Outstanding Teaching). In 1972 he was promoted to full professor. Though Dreyfus retired from his chair in 1994, he continued as professor of philosophy in the Graduate School (and held, from 1999, a joint appointment in the rhetoric department). He continued to teach philosophy at UC Berkeley until his last class in December 2016.

Dreyfus was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate for &quot;his brilliant and highly influential work in the field of artificial intelligence&quot; and his interpretation of twentieth century continental philosophy by Erasmus University.

Dreyfus died on April 22, 2017.

His younger brother and sometimes collaborator, Stuart Dreyfus, is a professor emeritus of industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley.

== Dreyfus&#x27; criticism of AI ==
Dreyfus&#x27; critique of artificial intelligence (AI) concerns what he considers to be the four primary assumptions of AI research. The first two assumptions are what he calls the &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; assumptions. The biological assumption is that the brain is analogous to computer hardware and the mind is analogous to computer software. The psychological assumption is that the mind works by performing discrete computations (in the form of algorithmic rules) on discrete representations or symbols.

Dreyfus claims that the plausibility of the psychological assumption rests on two others: the epistemological and ontological assumptions. The epistemological assumption is that all activity (either by animate or inanimate objects) can be formalized (mathematically) in the form of predictive rules or laws. The ontological assumption is that reality consists entirely of a set of mutually independent, atomic (indivisible) facts. It&#x27;s because of the epistemological assumption that workers in the field argue that intelligence is the same as formal rule-following, and it&#x27;s because of the ontological one that they argue that human knowledge consists entirely of internal representations of reality.

On the basis of these two assumptions, workers in the field claim that cognition is the manipulation of internal symbols by internal rules, and that, therefore, human behaviour is, to a large extent, context free (see contextualism). Therefore, a truly scientific psychology is possible, which will detail the &#x27;internal&#x27; rules of the human mind, in the same way the laws of physics detail the &#x27;external&#x27; laws of the physical world. However, it is this key assumption that Dreyfus denies. In other words, he argues that we cannot now (and never will be able to) understand our own behavior &quot;in the same way&quot; as we understand objects in, for example, physics or chemistry: that is, by considering ourselves as things whose behaviour can be predicted via &#x27;objective&#x27;, context free scientific laws. According to Dreyfus, a context-free psychology is a contradiction in terms.

Dreyfus&#x27;s arguments against this position are taken from the phenomenological and hermeneutical tradition (especially the work of Martin Heidegger). Heidegger argued that, contrary to the cognitivist views (on which AI has been based), our being is in fact highly context-bound, which is why the two context-free assumptions are false. Dreyfus doesn&#x27;t deny that we can &quot;choose to see&quot; human (or any) activity as being &#x27;law-governed&#x27;, in the same way that we can &quot;choose to see&quot; reality as consisting of indivisible atomic facts... if we wish. But it is a huge leap from that to state that because we want to or can see things in this way that &quot;it is therefore an objective fact that they are the case&quot;. In fact, Dreyfus argues that they are &quot;not&quot; (necessarily) the case, and that, therefore, any research program that assumes they &quot;are&quot; will quickly run into profound theoretical and practical problems. Therefore, the current efforts of workers in the field are doomed to failure.

Dreyfus argues that to get a device or devices with human-like intelligence would require them to have a human-like being-in-the-world and to have bodies more or less like ours, and social acculturation (i.e. a society) more or less like ours. (This view is shared by psychologists in the embodied psychology (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) and distributed cognition traditions. His opinions are similar to those of robotics researchers such as Rodney Brooks as well as researchers in the field of artificial life.)

Contrary to a popular misconception, Dreyfus never predicted that computers would never beat humans at chess. In Alchemy and Artificial Intelligence, he only reported (correctly) the state of the art of the time: &quot;Still no chess program can play even amateur chess.&quot;

Daniel Crevier writes: &quot;time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus&#x27;s comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.&quot;

==Webcasting philosophy==
When UC Berkeley and Apple began making a selected number of lecture classes freely available to the public as podcasts beginning around 2006, a recording of Dreyfus teaching a course called &quot;Man, God, and Society in Western Literature – From Gods to God and Back&quot; rose to the 58th most popular webcast on iTunes. These webcasts have attracted the attention of many, including non-academics, to Dreyfus and his subject area.

<doc id="952930" wikidata="Q2307219" url="?curid=952930" title="SHGb02+14a">
<text>SHGb02+14a is an astronomical radio source and a candidate in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discovered in March 2003 by SETI@home and announced in &quot;New Scientist&quot; on September 1, 2004.

==Observation==
The source was originally detected by Oliver Voelker of Logpoint in Nuremberg, Germany and Nate Collins of Farin and Associates in Wisconsin, USA using the giant Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico. It was observed three times (for a total of about one minute) at a frequency of about 1420 MHz, one of the frequencies in the waterhole region, which is theorized to be a good candidate for frequencies used by extraterrestrial intelligence to broadcast contact signals.

There are a number of puzzling features of this candidate, which have led to a large amount of skepticism. The source is located between the constellations Pisces and Aries, a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years from Earth. It is also a very weak signal. The frequency of the signal has a rapid drift, changing by between 8 and 37 hertz per second. If the cause is Doppler shift, it would indicate emission from a planet rotating nearly 40 times faster on its axis than the Earth. Each time the signal was detected, it was again at about 1420 MHz, the original frequency before any drift.

There are a number of potential explanations for this signal. SETI@home has denied media reports of a likely extraterrestrial intelligence signal. It could be an artifact of random chance, cosmic noise or even a glitch in the technology.

===Star field===
The region is unusually devoid of any nearby stars. The closest star systems in the approximate region of the signal include the binary star G 73-11A and B, which are 106.1 light-years from the Sun, although the unrelated star G 73-10 is only 108.7 light-years away, less than three light-years from G 73-11A and B. All of these stars are red dwarfs much less massive than the Sun. The much nearer star, L 1159-16, which is one of the nearest 40 stars to the Sun, is near the signal&#x27;s position, but its proximity is likely coincidental.

<doc id="952935" wikidata="Q17102158" url="?curid=952935" title="Liberalism in Switzerland">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and the historical radicalism movement within liberalism in Switzerland. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
In the nineteenth century the radicalism of &quot;Freisinn&quot; became the dominant political force in Switzerland, which remained for a long time in the twentieth century. Both the major Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (&quot;Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei der Schweiz/Parti Radical-Démocratique Suisse&quot;, member LI, ALDE Party) and the minor Liberal Party of Switzerland (&quot;Liberale Partei der Schweiz/Parti Libéral Suisse&quot;, member LI) were right-of-center liberal parties that merged into FDP.The Liberals (&quot;FDP.Die Liberalen/PLR.Les Libéraux-Radicaux&quot;, observer LI, member ALDE) in 2009.

==Timeline==
===Regeneration===
===From Liberal Democrats to Liberal Party of Switzerland===
* 1893: The moderate liberals established the Liberal Democrats (&quot;Liberaldemokraten&quot;), but most German-speaking liberals joined in 1894 the ⇒ Free Democratic Party of Switzerland
* 1913: The party is renamed Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Liberaldemokratische Partei&quot;)
* 1961: The party is reorganised into the Liberal Democratic Union of Switzerland (&quot;Liberaldemokratische Union der Schweiz&quot;)
* 1977: The party is renamed Liberal Party of Switzerland (&quot;Liberale Partei der Schweiz/Parti Libéral Suisse&quot;)

===Free Democratic Party of Switzerland===
* 1894: The Radicals (&quot;Freisinn&quot; in German) became a dominant factor in Swiss politics and established as a party the Free Democratic Party of Switzerland (&quot;Freisinnig-Demokratische Partei der Schweiz/Parti Radical-Démocratique Suisse&quot;)
* 1896: A faction formed the ⇒ Extreme Left
* 1918: A conservative faction of the party seceded as the Farmers&#x27;, Traders&#x27; and Citizens&#x27; Party
* 1941: The Zürich branch joined the ⇒ Democratic Party of Switzerland
* 1971: The Zürich branch of the ⇒ Democratic Party of Switzerland rejoined the party

===From Extreme Left to Democratic Party of Switzerland===
* 1896: The left wing of the ⇒ Free Democratic Party of Switzerland established the Extreme Left (&quot;Äußerste Linke&quot;)
* 1905: The Extreme Left organised itself as the social liberal Democratic Party of Switzerland (&quot;Demokratische Partei der Schweiz&quot;)
* 1941: A Zürich faction of the ⇒ Free Democratic Party of Switzerland joined the party
* 1971: The Zürich branch of the party returned to the ⇒ Free Democratic Party of Switzerland, while the Glarus and Grisons branches merged into the Swiss People&#x27;s Party

===Ring of Independents===
* 1936: Gottlieb Duttweiler formed the Ring of Independents as a social-liberal party
* 1999: The party disbanded

<text>Each of the 14 regions of Namibia is further subdivided into electoral constituencies. The size of the constituencies varies with the size and population of each region. There are currently 121 constituencies in Namibia. The most populous constituency according to the 2011 census was Rundu Urban in the Kavango West region with 63,431 people; the least populous was Okatyali in the Oshana Region with 3,187 people.

Local councillors are directly elected through secret ballots (regional elections) by the inhabitants of their constituencies. They occupy a constituency office in the main settlement of their district. However, once elected they keep their full-time job and are expected to run their constituencies after hours. Consequently, they receive allowances rather than salaries, although the remuneration does compare to a mid-range salaried position.

Regional councillors are indirectly elected from and by the constituency councillors in each region. Each region sends three of their local councillors to represent their region in the National Council of Namibia.

==Establishment==
The administrative division of Namibia is tabled by Boundaries Delimitation and Demarcation Commissions, short: Delimitation Commissions, and accepted or declined by the National Assembly. In 1992, the first Delimitation Commission determined the number of constituencies to be 95. Since then, every Delimitation Commission has increased this number to accommodate population growth. The fourth Delimitation Commission increased the number of constituencies to its present number in 2013. The fifth Delimitation Commission was appointed in April 2024 and is expected to submit its report in July.

<text>USS &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; (SSBN 640), the lead ship of her class of ballistic missile submarine, was the only submarine of the United States Navy to be named for Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 November 1962 and her keel was laid down there on 25 May 1963. She was launched on 5 December 1964, sponsored by Mrs. Francis L. Moseley and Mrs. Leon V. Chaplin, great, great, great, great, great-granddaughters of Benjamin Franklin, and commissioned on 22 October 1965, with Captain Donald M. Miller commanding the Blue Crew and Commander Ross N. Williams commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
On 6 December 1965, the Gold Crew successfully launched a Polaris A-3 ballistic missile in close coordination with an orbital pass of the &quot;Gemini 7&quot; astronauts Frank Borman and Jim Lovell.

:&quot;History needed for 1965–1993.&quot;

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; was decommissioned on 23 November 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 21 August 1995.

<doc id="952948" wikidata="Q694547" url="?curid=952948" title="Traffic cone">
<text>Traffic cones, also called pylons, witches&#x27; hats, road cones, highway cones, safety cones, caution cones, channelizing devices, construction cones, roadworks cones, or just cones, are usually cone-shaped markers that are placed on roads or footpaths to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. They are often used to create separation or merge lanes during road construction projects or automobile accidents, although heavier, more permanent markers or signs are used if the diversion is to stay in place for a long period of time.

==History==
Traffic cones were invented by Charles D. Scanlon, an American who, while working as a painter for the Street Painting Department of the City of Los Angeles, was unimpressed with the traditional wooden tripods and barriers used to mark roads which were damaged or undergoing repainting. Scanlon regarded these wooden structures as easily broken, hard to see, and a hazard to passing traffic. Scanlon&#x27;s rubber cone was designed to return to an upright position when struck by a glancing blow. The patent for his invention was granted in 1943.

Traffic cones were first used in the United Kingdom in 1958, when the M6 motorway opened. These traffic cones were a substitute for red lantern paraffin burners being used during construction on the Preston Bypass. In 1961, David Morgan of Burford, Oxfordshire, UK believes that he constructed the first experimental plastic traffic cones, which replaced pyramid-shaped wooden ones previously used.

In the United States on May 1, 1959, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in Oakland, California adopted the policy of placing orange safety cones at the left front and left rear corners of their service trucks while parked on the street to increase visibility and safety for the workers. This policy was implemented as the result of a suggestion by their employee, Russell Storch, a cable splicer. He was awarded $45 for his suggestion. This policy is still in use today.

Modern traffic cones are usually made of brightly colored thermoplastic. PVC from bottles can be recycled to make traffic cones.

== Usage ==

=== Traffic management ===

Traffic cones are typically used outdoors during road work or other situations requiring traffic redirection or advance warning of hazards or dangers, or the prevention of traffic. For night time use or low-light situations traffic cones are usually fitted with a retroreflective sleeve to increase visibility. On occasion, traffic cones may also be fitted with flashing lights for the same reason.

In the US, cones are required by the US Federal Highway Administration&#x27;s &quot;Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD) to be fitted with reflective white bands to increase night-time visibility. Reflective collars, white strips made from white reflective plastic, slip over cones snugly, and tape or adhesive can be used to permanently attach the collars to the cones.

==== Types and sizes ====

Traffic cones are designed to be highly visible and easily movable. Various sizes are used, commonly ranging from around to a little over . Typical traffic cones are fluorescent &quot;safety&quot; orange, but other bright colors including yellow, pink, red, and lime green are also used, with the color depending on context in some countries. The cones usually have a retroreflective strip (commonly known as &quot;flash tape&quot;) to increase their visibility at night.

In the United States, they come in such sizes as:
* , – for indoor/outdoor applications
* , – for outdoor applications such as freeway line painting
* , , (also called Metro cones for their use in cities) – for non-highway applications such as local streets 
* , – for freeway/highway applications (with reflective stripes)
* , – for freeway/highway applications (with reflective stripes)

In New Zealand, they are compliant in two sizes for use on all roads; these are:

* 35 in (900mm), up to 16.5 lb (7 kg) - for all activities on all roads. (with two reflective stripes)
* 17.7 in (450mm), up to 16.5 lb (7 kg) - for the protection of wet road markings only (with one reflective stripe)

=== Other forms ===
Cones are easy to move or remove. Where sturdier (and larger) markers are needed, construction sites use traffic barrels (plastic orange barrels with reflective stripes, normally about the same size as a 200-liter (55 gallon) drum. When a lane closure must also be a physical barrier against cars accidentally crossing it, a Fitch barrier, in which the barrels are filled with sand, or a Jersey barrier is used.

In many countries such as Australia and in some American states such as California, traffic barrels are rarely seen; pillar-shaped moveable bollards are instead used where larger and sturdier warning or delineation devices are needed. Typically, bollards are high fluorescent orange posts with reflective sleeve and heavyweight rubber bases. Larger devices such as barrier boards may be used instead of cones where larger areas need to be excluded or for longer periods.

=== Indoor and non-traffic use ===
Cones are used to lay out courses for autocross competitions.

Cones are also frequently used in indoor public spaces to mark off areas which are closed to pedestrians, such as a restroom being out of order, or to denote a dangerous condition, such as a slippery floor. They can be used on school playgrounds to limit areas of a playing field, and on ice rinks to define class, private party, or private lesson areas. Some of the cones used for this purpose are miniature, as small as tall, and some are disposable full-size cones made of biodegradable paper.

Being distinctive, easily portable and usually left unguarded, traffic cones are often stolen. Students are frequently blamed, to the extent that the British National Union of Students has attempted to play down this &quot;outdated stereotype&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

In 2007, artist Dennis Oppenheim commemorated the traffic cone with a monumental sculpture of five 20&#x27; (six metre) tall cones. They were installed temporarily in Miami, Seattle&#x27;s Olympic Sculpture Park, and Seoul, Korea.

An orange-and-white cone is the logo used by VideoLAN (best known for its VLC media player software).

German group Kraftwerk featured traffic cones on their first two albums, as well as in their concerts at the time.

Traditionally, but unofficially, the Wellington Statue in Glasgow is decorated with a traffic cone. The presence of the cone is given as the reason the statue is in the Lonely Planet 1000 Ultimate Sights guide (at number 229) as a &quot;most bizarre monument&quot;.

=== Television ===
&quot;The Traffic Cones&quot; is a Belgian TV series on Nickelodeon created by Pascal Adant.

<text>USS &quot;Kamehameha&quot; (SSBN-642) was a &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine and the only ship in the United States Navy to be named after Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawaii (c. 1758–1819). She is one of only two United States ships named after a monarch. She was later reclassified as an attack submarine and re-designated SSN-642.

The ship&#x27;s motto was &quot;Imua&quot;, which roughly translates from Hawaiian as &quot;go forth and conquer.&quot; Another motto used by her crew was &quot;Kam do&quot;, a play on the phrase &quot;can do.&quot;

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California on August 31, 1962. The &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was sponsored by Mrs. Pauline Nawahineokalai King (née Evans), widow of Samuel Wilder King, the eleventh Territorial Governor of Hawaii, and commissioned on December 10, 1965 with Commander Roth S. Leddick in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Robert W. Dickieson in command of the Gold Crew. Construction began on May 2, 1963 and she was launched on January 16, 1965. 

Conducting deterrence patrols during the Cold War, &quot;Kamehameha&quot;&#x27;s armament was 16 Poseidon ballistic missiles plus 10–12 Mark 48 heavy torpedoes non-ADCAP (advanced capability).

== Service history ==
&quot;Kamehameha&quot; was built by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. Upon completion, she went on her first sea trials off the coast of California. She conducted missile firing tests at Cape Canaveral, Florida, after which she sailed to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Although Pearl Harbor was her home port until 1970, she made all of her Pacific patrols out of Apra Harbor, Guam, to permit maximum time on patrol station with a minimum transit time to and from port.

&quot;Kamehameha&quot; joined the United States Pacific Fleet and the Blue Crew began her first deterrent patrol on 6 August 1966. In November 1966, the Gold Crew relieved the Blue Crew and returned to patrol. On her last Pacific patrol, the Blue Crew took her to the Pacific Missile Test Range to fire two dummy warhead missiles. The Blue Crew then took &quot;Kamehameha&quot; into port at Pearl Harbor to prepare for transfer to the Atlantic Fleet.

The Gold Crew relieved the Blue Crew and spent the next few weeks in Honolulu allowing the people of Hawaii to go aboard and see the submarine named in honor of the King of Hawaii. In early June 1970, with the Gold Crew operating the boat, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; got underway for Charleston, South Carolina via the Panama Canal for duty with Submarine Squadron 18 based at Charleston. The submerged transit to the Panama Canal took approximately seven days, and upon arrival off the coast of Panama, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; surfaced and was met by the Panama Canal pilot who took her through. The passage through the canal was given priority by the canal authorities, and so little time was spent waiting to enter. The boat was the object of considerable curiosity from those on ships nearby, and from the onlookers ashore. Once clear of the canal, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; submerged again and began the final leg of the transit, passing through the Caribbean and out into the Atlantic.

&quot;Kamehameha&quot; surfaced just east of the Charleston harbor sea buoy and waited for the tug to bring Miss Charleston on board. The information about Miss Charleston was in Commander Submarine Squadron 18&#x27;s message of instructions for &quot;Kamehameha&quot;&#x27;s arrival and had caused excitement among the bachelor junior officers. Both the Officer of the Deck, a lieutenant and the Junior Officer of the Deck were scanning the channel. One lookout reported a Navy tug just appearing in the distance. All binoculars were trained on the tug, and the OOD reported, &quot;I see a female standing on the bow!&quot; Thirty seconds later, he then reported, &quot;Captain, that&#x27;s not Miss Charleston, that&#x27;s your wife!&quot; The remark was relayed to a reporter who also had arrived on the tug, and the next day, in the Charleston newspaper, the Society page bore the headline, &quot;That&#x27;s Not Miss Charleston, That&#x27;s the Captain&#x27;s Wife!&quot; Miss Charleston had gone to the wrong pier in the shipyard and thus missed the boat.

Shortly after &quot;Kamehameha&quot;&#x27;s arrival, she was ordered to sail on patrol earlier than scheduled to fill in for another boat that had suffered a casualty to the main engines. &quot;Kamehameha&quot; exchanged all 16 missiles in less than 24 hours and replaced the ship&#x27;s battery. She then took Commander Submarine Flotilla Six, on board and proceeded to sea for four days of sea trials, allowing the flotilla commander to see the capabilities of the new boat. In the event, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; passed with flying colors and embarked on her first Atlantic Fleet deterrent patrol. She made two more patrols, one Blue and one Gold, and in April 1971, was taken by the Blue Crew into the shipyard for a major overhaul, including refitting for the newer Poseidon missile system, and refueling of the reactor. On 31 May 1971, the Gold Crew was disbanded during the overhaul. 

Between 1974 and 1978 she belonged to Submarine Group 2, Squadron 16; homeported in New London, Connecticut, and advance-based in Rota, Spain. She conducted nuclear deterrent patrols in the Atlantic and vicinity without incident in 1975 and 1976. During September–November 1976, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; spent time in Charleston, South Carolina, conducting SPECOPS with other units, then onto the AUTEC range for qualifications before resuming patrol duties after her return to Rota. 

The &quot;Kamehameha&quot; entered Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) in 1981 for a non-refueling overhaul. She finished sea trials in late 1982 and worked her way from Groton, Connecticut, to Port Canaveral, Florida, and then to Charleston for her complement of missiles. She then transferred to Holy Loch, Scotland. During the late 1980s, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; completed a refueling overhaul at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Following completion, she transferred to Groton in December 1989 for re-certification inspections and training. During this period, the Gold Crew launched the last Poseidon C-3 (no tactical warheads installed) from missile tube No. 4 off Port Canaveral, Florida. Following certification, she returned to deterrent patrol operations in November 1990 and returned to Holy Loch, Scotland. In August 1991, with the deactivation of the Poseidon missile system, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; transferred from Holy Loch to Groton and performed non-deterrent patrol operations until July 1992 when she left for conversion.

For much of her operational career, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was based in Rota, Spain.

==Conversion to attack submarine==
In September 1992 through July 1993, at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; was converted to a Dry Deck Shelter/swimmer delivery platform, reclassified as an attack submarine, and given hull number SSN-642; her ballistic missile capability was removed, and she carried only torpedoes as armament. After her conversion, there was only one crew, and her subsequent missions included SEAL special warfare operations. Following conversion, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for the remainder of her operational career.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Kamehameha&quot; was decommissioned on 2 April 2002 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She was the last of the original 41 for Freedom fleet ballistic missile submarines in service, and the oldest submarine in the United States Navy at the time of her decommissioning. The wardroom of the oldest submarine in the fleet carried Richard O&#x27;Kane&#x27;s personal cribbage board, and upon &quot;Kamehameha&quot;″s decommissioning the board was transferred to the next oldest boat, . Upon her decommissioning, &quot;Kamehameha&quot; had been the longest serving nuclear-powered submarine in history, with a total service period exceeding 37 years. This was exceeded by the in July 2018, prior to her own decommissioning on 18 May 2021.

&quot;Kamehameha&quot;″s scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, began in October 2002 and was completed on 28 February 2003.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Kamehameha&quot;″s commissioning gifts from the State of Hawaii, including her bust of King Kamehameha I, an Acacian Acacia koa plate used for eating, bow and spear, and the wardroom monkeypod wood table, are on display at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at the Pacific Fleet Submarine Museum. Her periscopes have been donated to Deterrent Park on Submarine Base Bangor, Washington, to become part of the exhibit.

<text>USS &quot;George Bancroft&quot; (SSBN-643), a (or &quot;640-class&quot;) fleet ballistic missile submarine, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of George Bancroft (1800-1891), United States Secretary of the Navy (1845–1846) and the founder of the United States Naval Academy.

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;George Bancroft&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 November 1962 and her keel was laid down there on 24 August 1963. She was launched on 20 March 1965, sponsored by Mrs. Jean B. Langdon, great, great-granddaughter of Secretary Bancroft, and Mrs. Anita C. Irvine, his great, great, great-granddaughter, and commissioned on 22 January 1966, with Captain Joseph Williams in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Walter M. Douglass in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;George Bancroft&quot; was assigned to Submarine Squadron 14 of Submarine Flotilla 6 with New London, Connecticut, as her home port. Her first deployment began with her departure from New London on her first deterrent patrol on 26 July 1966, manned by the Blue Crew. Soon after she successfully completed the patrol with her arrival at Holy Loch, Scotland, the Gold Crew relieved the Blue Crew. A few weeks later, &quot;George Bancroft&quot; got underway for her second deterrent patrol, manned by the Gold Crew, which ended toward the close of the year. Early in 1967, &quot;George Bancroft&quot; began her third deterrent patrol, manned by the Blue Crew.

:&quot;History needed for 1967-1993.&quot;

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;George Bancroft&quot; was decommissioned on 21 September 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 30 March 1998.

<text>USS &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; (SSBN-654), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for General of the Army George C. Marshall (1880-1959), who served as U.S. Secretary of State from 1947 to 1949 and as U.S. Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1951.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 29 July 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 2 March 1964. She was launched on 21 May 1965, sponsored by Katherine Tupper Marshall, widow of General Marshal. At the launching ceremony, former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson (1893–1971) eloquently described &quot;George C. Marshall&quot;″s strategic deterrent role in the Cold War in this way: &quot;... the waves set up by this launching will go to the furthest reaches of our foreign relations. The very existence of this ship, her power, her mission, her orders, her competence to execute them, will affect more computations, more decisions, than we can readily imagine. Far beyond the Pentagon, the State Department, and the White House, she will add a new factor, a new magnitude, to the correlation of forces by which the communists determine their decisions.&quot;

&quot;George C. Marshall&quot; was commissioned on 29 April 1966, with Commander Warren Richardson Cobean, Jr. in command of the Blue Crew and Commander Willard Edward Johnson in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==

:&quot;History needed for 1973-1981.&quot;

* September 1969, the Blue crew went aboard in Holy Loch, Scotland, and departed in October on patrol #7 under the command of Capt Hay. In December the ship returned to Holy Loch and the Gold crew took over.
* This sequence was repeated in March 1970 with the Blue crew returning on board in Holy Loch. It tied up alongside the submarine tender USS Canopus.
*1970 and 1971, the Gold and Blue crews repeated the sequence except that the Gold crew returned to Charleston, SC in March 1971. The Blue crew was under the command of Capt Roy C. Paul for patrols #11 and #13 returning to Holy Loch before transit to overhaul via the Panama Canal.
* Refueling and Poseidon Conversion Overhaul September 1971- March 1973
* April 1973 successfully performed DASO ballistic missile launch
* November 1975 visited Faslane Submarine Base in Scotland
* Operated out of Rota Naval Station, Rota, Spain mid-1970s
* Late in 1970s &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; was caught in a fishing trawler net during a transit from Holy Loch, Scotland, leaving a scar on her sail from the wire
* In 1980 &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; went through an extensive overhaul in the floating dry dock USS Los Alamos (AFDB-7) in Holy Loch, Scotland
* Leaving Holy Loch, Scotland, &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; made a port call in Weymouth, England for 2 days
* Conducted midshipman ops out of Naval Submarine Base New London, CT
* Moved to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, GA for one patrol and test fired ballistic missiles prior to entering shipyard for overhaul
* Moved to Naval Weapons Station Charleston, SC to unload weapons prior to entering overhaul at Newport News Shipyard.

During an at Newport News Shipbuilding that lasted from 1981 to 1984, &quot;George C. Marshall&quot; underwent modifications that included the removal of her Mk 45 ASTOR (and the related 4FZ alarm system) and her Mark 14 torpedo and Mark 37 torpedo capabilities and the installation of a Mobile Submarine Simulator (MOSS) decoy capability on tubes 3 and 4.

:&quot;History needed for 1984-1992.&quot;

&quot;George C. Marshall&quot; conducted 78 strategic deterrent patrols during her career and was one of the last units to leave Holy Loch, Scotland, following the closing of that base in 1992. She conducted her last dive off San Diego, California, in 1992 on her way to Bremerton, Washington, for decommissioning.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;George C. Marshall&quot; was decommissioned on 24 September 1992 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton was completed on 28 February 1994.

<text>USS &quot;Francis Scott Key&quot; (SSBN-657), a ballistic missile submarine, was the only submarine of the United States Navy to be named for Francis Scott Key (1779–1843), an American lawyer, author, and amateur poet who wrote the poem &quot;The Defense of Fort McHenry&quot;, which became the words to the United States&#x27; national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. During World War II there was a liberty ship named SS Francis Scott Key.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Francis Scott Key&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 29 July 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 5 December 1964. She was launched on 23 April 1965, sponsored by Mrs. Marjory Key Thorne and Mrs. William T. Jarvis, both direct descendants of Key, and commissioned on 3 December 1966, with Captain Frank W. Graham in command of the Blue Crew and Lieutenant Commander Joseph B. Logan in command of the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
The &quot;Francis Scott Key&quot; was part of Submarine Squadron (SUBRON) 16 based in Rota, Spain. The squadron and submarines moved to Kings Bay, Georgia in 1979.

The &quot;Key&quot; conducted the first submerged launch of a Trident missile in 1979. She also became the first submarine to go on deterrent patrol with Trident I missiles.

The Gold crew performed the submarine&#x27;s last SSBN deterrent patrol, Patrol #72, in 1992. The &quot;Key&quot; combined crews and changed homeport from Charleston, SC to Pearl Harbor, HI in late 1992.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Francis Scott Key&quot; was decommissioned on 2 September 1993 with Commander Carl D. Olson in command, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 1 September 1995.

<doc id="952962" wikidata="Q2458580" url="?curid=952962" title="Republic of New Afrika">
<text>The Republic of New Afrika (RNA), founded in 1968 as the Republic of New Africa, is a black nationalist organization and black separatist movement in the United States popularized by black militant groups. The larger New Afrika movement in particular has three goals:

* Creation of an independent black-majority country situated in the Southeastern United States, in the heart of an area of black-majority population.
* Payment by the federal government of several billion dollars in reparations to African American descendants of slaves for the damages inflicted on Africans and their descendants by chattel enslavement, Jim Crow laws, and modern-day forms of racism.
* A referendum of all African Americans to determine their desires for citizenship; movement leaders say their ancestors were not offered a choice in this matter after emancipation in 1865 following the American Civil War.

==History==
The idea of the RNA arose following the events of the 1967 Detroit riot. It was the first separate nation declared by African Americans in the United States.

The vision for this country was first promulgated by the Malcolm X Society on March 31, 1968, at a Black Government Conference held in Detroit, Michigan. The conference participants drafted a constitution and declaration of independence, and they identified five Southern states Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina (with adjoining areas in East Texas and North Florida) as subjugated national territory.

The Black Government Conference was convened by the Malcolm X Society and the Group on Advanced Leadership (GOAL), two influential Detroit-based black organizations with broad followings. The attendees produced a Declaration of Independence, a constitution, and the framework for a provisional government. 

The RNA elected black leaders from a number of different organizations as provisional government officials. Robert F. Williams, then living in exile in China, was chosen as the first president of the provisional government; attorney Milton Henry (a student of Malcolm X&#x27;s teachings) was named first vice president; and Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, served as second vice president. Imari Obadele was its first Minister of Information. An RNA delegation traveled to China to meet Williams in June 1968. Williams accepted the position and proposed diplomatic initiatives for the RNA to undertake.

The Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika (PG-RNA) advocated/advocates a form of cooperative economics through the building of New Communities—named after the Ujamaa concept promoted by Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. It proposed militant self-defense through the building of local people&#x27;s militias and a standing army to be called the Black Legion; and the building of racially based organizations to champion the right of self-determination for people of black African descent.

The organization was involved in numerous controversial issues. For example, it attempted to assist Oceanhill-Brownsville area in Brooklyn to secede from the United States during the 1968 conflict over control of public schools. Additionally, it was involved with shootouts at New Bethel Baptist Church in 1969 (during the one-year anniversary of the founding) and another in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1971. (It had announced that the capital of the Republic would be in Hinds County, Mississippi, located on a member&#x27;s farm.) In the confrontations, law-enforcement officials were killed and injured. Organization members were prosecuted for the crimes the members claimed was in self defense.

==Notable members==
*Queen Mother Moore was a founding member. She helped found the group and helped out in the group as much as she could.
*Betty Shabazz, widow of Malcolm X, was elected as second vice president of the first administration in 1968, working alongside Williams and Henry.
*Chokwe Lumumba, formerly Edwin Finley Taliaferro of Detroit, was elected as second vice president in 1971. He later became an attorney, working in Michigan and Mississippi in public defense. After settling in Jackson, Mississippi, he was elected to the city council there. He was elected as mayor in 2013, dying in office in February 2014 of natural causes.
*Safiya Bukhari, former Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army member, founder of the Jericho Movement for U.S. Political Prisoners and Prisoners of War, and co-founder of the Free Mumia Abdul-Jamal Coalition (NYC) was elected as vice-president. 
*Sanyika Shakur, former leader of Eight Tray Gangster Crips and author (&quot;&quot;)

<text>Kenneth Alexander Keith, Baron Keith of Castleacre (30 August 1916 – 1 September 2004) was a British businessman and banker.

Keith was knighted in the 1969 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List and was created a life peer as Baron Keith of Castleacre, &quot;of Swaffham in the County of Norfolk&quot; on 6 February 1980.

He presided over the mergers that formed the British merchant bank Hill Samuel, and also chaired Rolls-Royce after the company&#x27;s receivership and subsequent nationalisation in 1971, helping to organise the recovery of the RB211 project. After retiring from those chairmanships in 1980 he was chairman of STC and of Beecham.

&quot;We (Rolls-Royce) added a zero to his stature; he used to think £5 million a lot of money, but after a few weeks on the RB211 he came to understand that £50 million is peanuts.&quot; – Stanley Hooker.

<doc id="952974" wikidata="Q3297148" url="?curid=952974" title="Steve Sax">
<text>Stephen Louis Sax (born January 29, 1960) is a retired American Major League Baseball player and coach. He played as a second baseman in Major League Baseball from 1981 to 1994, celebrated as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers with whom he won world championships in and . A five-time All-Star, Sax was named the National League Rookie of the Year in 1982 and won the Silver Slugger Award in 1986. He also played for the New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, and the Oakland Athletics. Sax hosts for SiriusXM&#x27;s MLB Network Radio.

==Career==
Sax starred at James Marshall High School (now known as River City High School) in West Sacramento, California, from 1975 to 1978. The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Sax in the ninth round of the 1978 MLB draft. Sax was a late season call up in 1981, playing 31 games. Sax broke into the majors as a regular in 1982, earning the National League Rookie of the Year award. Throughout his career, Sax was on the All-Star team five times and had a batting average over .300 in three seasons. He had great success on the basepaths, stealing over 40 bases in six different seasons, finishing with a career total of 444 stolen bases. His best year arguably came in 1986, when he finished second in the NL with a .332 batting average, 210 base hits, and 43 doubles, and won a Silver Slugger Award. Sax earned World Series rings with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1981 and 1988.

Following the end of the 1988 season, Sax signed with the New York Yankees as a free agent after feeling disrespected by the Dodgers during contract negotiations. In 1989, he made the All-Star team due to a strong start with the Yankees. He finished the season with a .315 batting average, 205 base hits, 88 runs, and 43 stolen bases. Sax made the All-Star team his last time in 1990, finishing the season with 43 stolen bases, though his batting average dropped to .260. In 1991, he had another strong year with the Yankees, finishing the season with a .304 batting average, 198 base hits, and 38 doubles.

Sax was also a higher-up in the Players Association during his career.

===Steve Sax syndrome===
Though never regarded as one of the top fielding second basemen in the league, Steve Sax inexplicably became incapable of making routine throws to first base in 1983, committing 30 errors that season. This is referred to in baseball terminology as &quot;Steve Sax syndrome&quot;, the fielder&#x27;s variant of &quot;Steve Blass disease&quot;, named after the Pirates pitcher who suffered a similar breakdown of basic mechanics (also known as &quot;the yips&quot;). As his accuracy suffered, fans sitting behind the first base dugout began wearing batting helmets as mock protection. (Teammate Pedro Guerrero, an outfielder pressed into service at third base in 1983, once reportedly stated that his first thought whenever he was in the field was &quot;I hope they don&#x27;t hit it to me&quot;, while his second thought was &quot;I hope they don&#x27;t hit it to Sax.&quot;) By 1989, however, Sax seemed to be completely &quot;cured&quot;, leading the American League in both fielding percentage and double plays. 

==Post-career==
Sax piloted a new networking site called allsportsconnection.com. Sax has made television cameos, including the &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, as well as episodes of &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;Sabrina The Teenage Witch&quot;. He has also been on the Fox News show &quot;Hannity&quot;. Sax played a supporting character in the 1998 movie &quot;Ground Control&quot;.

He briefly ran for a seat in the California State Assembly 5th District as a Republican in 1996. Sax later dropped out of the race, when his divorce became publicized. A black belt, he was also a part-owner of a martial arts studio in Roseville, California.

He worked as a financial consultant for RBC Dain Rauscher, LLC, in their Roseville, California, office. He had approximately 25 to 30 clients, including several athletes. He was a partner in the Sax/Hinman Sports Professional Group at RBC Dain Rauscher providing professional wealth management for sports professionals at every level of all professional sports.

In December 2012, Sax was named the first base coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks fired him on October 8, 2013.

As of 2015, Sax returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as an alumnus member of the Dodgers&#x27; Community Relations team.

Sax currently hosts SiriusXM&#x27;s MLB Network Radio.

==Personal life==
Steve is the brother of former Major League Baseball player Dave Sax, who also played for the Dodgers. He is the father of Lauren Ashley (Sax) Boyd and son John Jeremy Sax. His nephew David Sax Jr. (son of Dave Sax) was seen on an episode of &quot;Intervention&quot; in 2015. His son John, a captain in the United States Marine Corps, was one of five Marines killed in a V-22 Osprey training accident near San Diego, California on June 8, 2022.

A nephew, Nick Sogard, plays in Major League Baseball for the Boston Red Sox.

<doc id="952975" wikidata="Q1516849" url="?curid=952975" title="Shaw Communications">
<text>Shaw Communications Inc. was a Canadian telecommunications company which provided telephone, Internet, television, and mobile services. The company was founded in 1966 as Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd. by JR Shaw in Edmonton. The company was acquired by and amalgamated into Rogers Communications in 2023; most operations were rebranded to the Rogers brand beginning in July of that year, with services and sponsorships in former Shaw markets having used the transitional brand Rogers together with Shaw for promotional purposes.

At the time of its acquisition by Rogers, Shaw provided home telecommunications services primarily in Alberta and British Columbia and satellite television nationally. It also operated smaller cable television systems in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Northern Ontario. 

The company also provided mobile services through its subsidiary Freedom Mobile, under both the Freedom and Shaw Mobile brands, in areas of Alberta, British Columbia, and Southern Ontario; Freedom was sold to Vidéotron simultaneously with the Rogers merger. The company&#x27;s chief competitor for home telecommunications in western Canada was Telus Communications.

== History ==
Shaw was founded in 1966 by JR Shaw as &quot;Capital Cable Television Company, Ltd.&quot; in Edmonton, Alberta. It was originally a subsidiary of Shawcor, JR&#x27;s father&#x27;s firm, but the business was split from Shawcor in the 1970s. The company changed its name to Shaw Cablesystems Ltd. (after founder and chairman JR Shaw) and went public on the TSX in 1983. The company grew during the 1980s and 1990s through acquisitions of firms including Classicomm in the Toronto area, Access Communications in Nova Scotia, Fundy Cable in New Brunswick, Trillium Cable in Ontario, Telecable in Saskatchewan, Greater Winnipeg Cablevision (serving areas east of the Red River), and Videon Cablesystems of Winnipeg (serving areas west of the Red River), which, back in 1998, had itself previously acquired Vidéotron&#x27;s assets in Alberta. However, two swaps, in 1994 and 2001, with Rogers Cable have resulted in its assets being restricted to Western Canada and a few areas of Northern Ontario. In 1999, Shaw spun out its media properties into a second publicly traded company, Corus Entertainment. In 2001 the Moffat family sold Videon Cablesystems to Shaw.

Prior to 2003, Shaw owned cable systems in the United States previously owned by Moffat Communications, serving six communities in Florida (Eastern Pasco County, Clermont, Palm Coast, Ormond Beach, West Palm Beach and Doral), and the Houston, Texas suburbs of Kingwood, Lake Conroe and Lake Livingston. In February 2003, the Florida systems would be sold to Time Warner Cable (with the West Palm Beach and Doral systems later sold to Comcast, and the other systems spun off to Bright House Networks), while the Texas systems were sold to Cequel III, as part of its then-Cebridge Connections subsidiary (now Suddenlink Communications).

In 2008, Shaw entered the AWS spectrum auction with the intention of possibly becoming a wireless phone provider. The auction ended July 2008, giving Shaw Communications enough spectrum to build a wireless network in its home provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. This spectrum ultimately went unused and was sold to Rogers Communications in January 2013.

In July 2009, Shaw announced its acquisition of Mountain Cablevision; in September, Rogers sued Shaw to block the sale, citing violations of a non-compete clause. However, the suit was quickly dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court. The purchase was approved by the CRTC on October 22, 2009. The acquisition was Shaw&#x27;s first cable property east of Sault Ste. Marie since the 2001 swaps with Rogers and Cogeco. Shaw&#x27;s re-entry into Southern Ontario would be short-lived, as its Hamilton system would be resold to Rogers in January 2013 as part of a deal which also saw unused wireless spectrum sold to the company, and saw Rogers sell its stake in specialty channel TVtropolis.

===Return to broadcasting===
On April 30, 2009, Shaw announced a deal to acquire three television stations — CHWI-TV in Windsor, Ontario, CKNX-TV in Wingham, Ontario and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba — from CTVglobemedia. CTV had indicated that it would shut down the stations, all of which were incurring extensive financial losses, later in the year if a buyer could not be found, and had placed them on the market at a price of just $1 each. However, it was reported on June 30, 2009, that Shaw had backed out of the deal and was declining to complete the purchase. CHWI-TV would remain on the air as is; CKNX-TV would become a repeater of London station CFPL-TV in September 2009, while CKX-TV would close down entirely in October 2009.

In February 2010, Shaw announced an agreement with the financially troubled Canwest, whereby Shaw would buy an 80% voting interest, and 20% equity interest, in the restructured entity of Canwest, pending approvals from the CRTC and others. Three months later, following negotiations with rival bidders, the company said it would purchase the entirety of Canwest&#x27;s broadcasting assets, including the interests in the CW Media subsidiary partially held by Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. Canwest&#x27;s newspapers were not part of the Shaw deal and were sold separately to Postmedia Network.

The acquisition was completed on October 27, 2010, after CRTC approval for the sale was announced on October 22, forming the Shaw Media division.

===2012–2023 ===
In November 2012, Shaw underwent a corporate re-branding developed by the Vancouver-based agency Rethink, introducing an updated logo and slogan (&quot;You won&#x27;t miss a thing&quot;), along with a new promotional campaign featuring the animated characters Bit and Bud—robots who lived in a representation of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;pipe&quot;. The campaign drew comparisons to Bell Canada&#x27;s former beaver characters of Frank and Gordon, which were overseen by Shaw&#x27;s then-new chief marketing officer Jim Little while he was at Bell.

In April 2013, Shaw Business Solutions took over Enmax&#x27;s Envision subsidiary, which had built a fibre-optic network throughout Calgary. The acquisition was completed for $225 million. In 2014, Shaw partnered with Rogers Communications to launch Shomi, a subscription video on demand service.

In February 2015, Shaw announced that they would close operations for service call centres in Edmonton, Calgary and Kelowna, and consolidate operations in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal. 1,600 of Shaw&#x27;s 14,000 employees were affected by the consolidation and cuts. The company offered affected employees the option to relocate to its centralized offices, apply for a new job at their location, or leave the company with a severance package for former employees unable to relocate.

In 2013, Shaw attempted to begin developing an IPTV-based platform for its television services. However, after experiencing issues developing the platform, Shaw took a $55 million write-down in June 2015, and announced that it was licensing Comcast&#x27;s cloud-based Xfinity X1 architecture. In January 2016, Shaw launched its mobile television app FreeRange TV, based on X1 infrastructure, which allows Shaw subscribers to stream selected TV channels and on-demand content. On January 11, 2017, Shaw launched its X1-based cable service, &quot;BlueSky&quot;, in Calgary. Shaw later launched Comcast&#x27;s Xfinity xFi whole-home Wi-Fi platform under the &quot;BlueCurve&quot; branding.

==== Freedom Mobile, divestment of media assets ====
On December 16, 2015, Shaw announced its proposed acquisition of independent wireless provider Wind Mobile from its investors in a deal worth approximately $1.6 billion. The transaction closed on March 1, 2016. Under Shaw, the company was renamed Freedom Mobile in November 2016, coinciding with the launch of its 4G LTE network. The acquisition of Wind was funded by a reorganization in April 2016, which saw the Shaw Media unit transferred to Corus Entertainment, in exchange for $1.85 billion in cash and 71,364,853 class B non-voting shares of Corus. The sale did not include Shaw&#x27;s 50% stake in the Shomi streaming service and CJBN-TV Kenora; Shomi was shut down in November 2016 and CJBN-TV Kenora was shut down in January 2017.

=== Acquisition by Rogers ===
On March 15, 2021, Rogers announced that it would acquire Shaw for $26 billion, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. This proposed acquisition was criticized by public lobby groups like OpenMedia, as a move that would reduce national competition in the Canadian wireless communication market by removing one of the four major competitors from the market.

For the sale to go ahead, the CRTC ordered Rogers to divest Freedom Mobile. It was reported on June 17, 2022 that Quebecor, a media and telecommunications company based in Quebec, intended to acquire the company for 2.85 billion. The CRTC approved the merger on March 24, 2022.

On May 9, 2022, the Competition Bureau announced an application to the Competition Tribunal to block the transaction due to its effects on the wireless market.

On August 1, 2022, Rogers announced that the merger was expected to be completed at the end of the year; however, on October 25, 2022, it was announced that the Rogers-Shaw merger had been rejected as proposed. On January 24, 2023, Canada&#x27;s Federal Court of Appeal allowed the merger to proceed. The merger was approved by the federal government on March 31, 2023, and completed on April 3. Immediately following the transaction, Shaw Communications was amalgamated into Rogers Communications, and no longer exists as a separate entity, though some subsidiaries such as Shaw Cablesystems may still exist as distinct legal entities.

== Other activities ==
Shaw was the parent of Shaw Broadcast Services (previously Shaw Satellite Services, Canadian Satellite Communications, or Cancom) and, through Shaw Broadcast Services, Shaw Direct, one of Canada&#x27;s two national direct broadcast satellite providers. For many years it also owned a number of radio stations and specialty television services; these assets were later spun off into Corus Entertainment in an effort to satisfy a now-repealed CRTC policy discouraging cross-ownership of cablesystems and specialty services.

== Internet usage-based billing ==
In December 2010, Shaw filed complaints with the CRTC to have competing internet video services such as Netflix classified as broadcasters under Canadian law. In the same month, Shaw introduced usage-based billing on internet plans and lowered plan caps an average of 25% while introducing overage fees of $1 to $2 per gigabyte. On February 8, 2011, Shaw agreed to put a hold on usage-based billing for its services and to this date continues to not charge customers any overages for surpassing Internet data caps.

Ezra Isaac Levant (born February 20, 1972) is a Canadian media personality, political activist, writer, broadcaster, and former lawyer. Levant is the founder and former publisher of the conservative magazine, The&quot; Western Standard&quot;. He is also the co-founder, owner, and CEO of the far-right media website &quot;Rebel News&quot;. Levant has also worked as a columnist for Sun Media, and he hosted a daily program on the Sun News Network from the channel&#x27;s inception in 2011 until its demise in 2015.

Levant rose to prominence in 2006 after publishing the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons in The &quot;Western Standard&quot;, which led to a protracted legal battle with the Alberta Human Rights Commission regarding hate speech legislation and freedom of speech. The complaint against Levant was ultimately withdrawn. In February 2015, Levant co-founded &quot;Rebel News&quot; with Brian Lilley; Lilley left &quot;Rebel News&quot; in 2017 citing lack of editorial standards. Under Levant, &quot;Rebel News&quot; has been described as a platform for the anti-Islamic ideology known as counter-jihad.

Levant self-identifies as a libertarian conservative. He has been identified by others as belonging to the Canadian far right. Levant has expressed support for the Canadian petroleum industry and for fracking. Levant has been successfully sued for libel on multiple occasions, while apologies and retractions were issued by him or on his behalf on numerous other occasions.

==Early life and education==
Levant was born to an Ashkenazi Jewish family in Calgary, Alberta. His great-grandfather emigrated to Canada in 1903 from Russia to establish a homestead near Drumheller, Alberta. Levant grew up in a suburb of Calgary. He attended the Calgary Hebrew School in his childhood before transferring to a public junior high school.

Levant campaigned for the Reform Party of Canada as a teenager and joined it as a university student. From 1990 to 1993, while at the University of Calgary, his two-person team won the &quot;best debating&quot; category in the Inter-Collegiate Business Competition held at Queen&#x27;s University. The first two of those years, his debate partner was future Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi. He has subsequently accused Nenshi, who is Ismaili, of &quot;anti-Christian bigotry&quot; as mayor.

In 1994, he was featured in an article in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on young conservatives after accusing the University of Alberta of racism for instituting an affirmative action program of hiring women and Indigenous professors. After his actions outraged Indigenous law students, feminists, and a number of professors, Levant was called to a meeting with the assistant dean who advised him of the university&#x27;s non-academic code of conduct and defamation laws. As head of the university&#x27;s speakers committee, Levant organized a debate between Doug Christie, a lawyer known for his advocacy in defence of Holocaust deniers and accused Nazi war criminals, and Thomas Kuttner, a Jewish lawyer from the New Brunswick Human Rights Commission.

Levant was invited to write a guest column for the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; and interviewed on television. He spent the summer of 1994 in Washington, D.C., in an internship arranged by the libertarian Koch Summer Fellow Program. In 1995 he worked for the Fraser Institute and wrote &quot;Youthquake&quot;, which argued for smaller government, including privatization of the Canada Pension Plan. Levant saw &quot;youthquake,&quot; the term he used to describe what he identified as a conservative youth movement of the 1990s, as similar to the 1960s civil rights movement. In his eyes, instead of being enslaved by racism, his generation was &quot;enslaved by debt&quot;, and in order to liberate itself, society needed to dismantle elements such as trade unions, the minimum wage, universal health care, subsidized tuition, and public pension plans.

==Career==
===In law===
Levant was called to the Bar in 2000 and began practising law, working in a law firm for less than two years, but ceased his practice in order to pursue interests in politics and the media. Though a non-practising lawyer, he maintained his membership in the Law Society of Alberta until 2016 when he resigned. Levant had been the subject of 26 complaints to the Law Society since 2004 as a result of his public statements and political activities. 24 of the complaints were dismissed and the final two were pending when he resigned.

===At the &quot;Western Standard&quot;===

In 2004, Levant co-founded the &quot;Western Standard&quot;, an Alberta-based magazine with an emphasis on Western Canada and political conservatism. In October 2007, the magazine ceased publication of its print edition after failing to become profitable, becoming an online magazine. Levant later sold the publication&#x27;s remaining assets to Matthew Johnson, the former legislative aide to Rahim Jaffer.

On February 13, 2006, the &quot;Western Standard&quot; published the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons depicting unflattering images of Muhammad. Syed Soharwardy, a Calgary Imam and president of the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, complained about the publication to the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission.

On December 21, 2007, Soharwardy withdrew his complaint against the magazine when Johnston apologized directly and publicly to Soharwardy and Canada&#x27;s Muslim community for publishing the cartoons.

Levant refused to apologize and a hearing was scheduled for January 2008. On the day of the hearing, Levant republished the cartoons on his personal website. At the request of Levant and his lawyers, Levant was allowed to videotape his interview with Shirlene McGovern, a human rights investigator with the Alberta Human Rights Commission. Levant later posted the videos on YouTube.

On February 15, 2008, Soharwardy announced he was withdrawing his complaint against Levant. He said in a guest column for The Globe and Mail that publishing the cartoons &quot;was irresponsible and was intended to cause strife,&quot; but acknowledged their publication &quot;may not fall outside the limits of free speech.&quot; In August 2008, the Alberta Human Rights and Citizenship Commission dismissed a similar complaint against Levant made by the Edmonton Council of Muslim Communities.

Levant described his experience with the Alberta Human Rights Commission in his 2009 book, &quot;Shakedown&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Shakedown&quot; was selected as Writers&#x27; Trust and Samara&#x27;s &quot;Best Canadian Political Book of the Last 25 Years&quot; based on popular vote. Levant&#x27;s battle with the Alberta Human Rights Commission has been cited as having contributed to the 2012 repeal of Section 13 of the &quot;Canadian Human Rights Act&quot;.

In a January 2015 interview with Maclean&#x27;s that was done shortly after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris, Levant defended publishing the cartoons. He also criticized other media outlets for refusing to publish the cartoons or the material at Charlie Hebdo.

===As lobbyist and promoter===
From 2009 until 2010, Levant worked as a lobbyist for Rothman&#x27;s Incorporated, a manufacturer and distributor of tobacco products, and for Achieve Energy Services Limited Partnership, part of the Alberta oil and gas industry.

In March 2010, Levant accompanied fellow conservative personality Ann Coulter on a Canadian speaking tour. Her speech at the University of Ottawa was canceled at the last minute, apparently by its organizers, because of what Levant claimed was &quot;physical danger to Coulter and the audience&quot; from protesters. The Ottawa Police later disputed any claims of unrest or violence.

In 2010, Levant published the book &quot;Ethical Oil&quot;, which won the 2011 National Business Book Award. Levant&#x27;s 2014 book, &quot;Groundswell: The Case for Fracking&quot;, was a finalist for the 2015 National Business Book Award.

===As columnist===
Levant wrote an irregular column for the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; for ten years, until he was dropped in October 2007 because of &quot;internal decisions.&quot; He continued to write occasional columns for the &quot;National Post&quot; on a freelance basis until 2010.

In 2010, Levant joined Sun Media as a columnist and was given an on-air position on its Sun News Network as host of &quot;The Source&quot;, an evening talk show, when that channel launched in April 2011. In 2012, during his tenure at Sun News, Levant received Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal. On February 13, 2015, Sun News Network was shut down, hence terminating &quot;The Source.&quot; His column for QMI/Sun Media ended at the same time.

===At &quot;Rebel News&quot;===

Following the closure of Sun News Network, on February 16, 2015, Levant launched &quot;The Rebel&quot; website as a corporate endeavour with a YouTube channel for videos produced by himself, Brian Lilley and other former Sun News Network personalities. Levant argued his online production would be unencumbered by the regulatory and distribution challenges faced by the Sun News Network. He also said lower production costs would make it more viable. A crowdfunding campaign raised $100,000 for the project.

Lilley quit the Rebel on 12 August 2017, following coverage of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by Faith Goldy, who was later fired by Levant. Lilley said he had become uncomfortable with what he felt was an &quot;increasingly harsh tone&quot; when The Rebel discussed topics such as immigration or Islam. He also accused The Rebel of exhibiting a &quot;lack of editorial and behavioural judgment that left unchecked will destroy it and those around it.&quot;

In 2017, The Rebel was repeatedly the object of controversy, including advertising boycott campaigns in Canada and the UK, the loss of several well-known contributors, and the cancellation under pressure of a planned Caribbean cruise featuring The Rebel personalities. As of February 20, 2022, The Rebel Media had more than 1.56 million subscribers on its YouTube channel.

==Legal disputes==
===Ron Ghitter===
In 1998, Levant wrote a Reform Party fundraising letter in which he criticized Alberta Progressive Conservative Senator Ron Ghitter. Ghitter sued for defamation and in 2000, Canadian Alliance MP Rob Anders and Levant admitted liability and issued a formal apology and undisclosed damages to settle the suit. The apology stated, &quot;Our attack on Senator Ghitter was unfounded and we now admit having defamed Senator Ghitter. We further acknowledge that some of our statements were based on facts that were false.&quot;

===George Soros===
In September 2010, Levant wrote a column for Sun Media accusing George Soros of funding avaaz.org, a group lobbying to stop Sun Media being granted a licence for Sun TV News Channel, and strongly attacking Soros&#x27;s character and history by alleging that as a child he collaborated with the Nazis.
Soros threatened to sue Sun Media for libel and on September 18, Sun Media issued a retraction and apology to Soros.

===Giacomo Vigna===
On 18 November 2010 and 26 January 2011, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that Levant was to pay Giacomo Vigna, a Canadian Human Rights Commission lawyer, $25,000 and $32,500, respectively.Levant accused Vigna of lying to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, tampering with evidence, and suggested he&#x27;d been fired ... Justice Robert Smith ruled that Levant &quot;spoke in reckless disregard of the truth and for an ulterior purpose of denormalizing the Human Rights Commission across Canada which makes his statements malicious in that sense.&quot;At the 2010 hearing, Levant was ordered to pay $25,000 to Vigna and to remove the libellous materials from his website. At the subsequent hearing, Vigna argued for more compensation to cover his lawyers&#x27; fees and Levant was ordered to pay an additional $32,500.

===Khurrum Awan===
Ezra Levant was successfully sued for libel by lawyer Khurrum Awan.
According to his statement of claim and records of court proceedings, Awan claimed that Levant&#x27;s blog writings had repeatedly described him as being: &quot;Khurrum Awan the liar&quot;, &quot;stupid, a &quot;fool&quot;, &quot;serial, malicious, money-grubbing liar&quot;, &quot;unequivocally implied that he was an anti-Semite and perjurer&quot;. Awan states that Levant also stated that Awan believes it is permissible to lie to further the cause of Islam. Awan claimed that as a result, he has &quot;suffered mental distress, humiliation and loss of professional reputation.&quot; In his statement of defence, Levant replied that &quot;any damage to Mr. Awan&#x27;s reputation was self-inflicted.&quot; Levant declined comment but in an email described Awan as a &quot;master of lawfare&quot; who was engaged in &quot;an exceedingly political lawsuit.&quot;

Levant launched a website &quot;Stand With Ezra&quot; to support and fundraise for his defence, claiming that this and other lawsuits against him are affronts to Charter rights to free expression, describing them as &quot;nuisance&quot; suits and politically motivated attempt to silence him which &quot;add to the price of freedom in Canada.&quot;

However, Levant himself sued a Calgary alternative newspaper and conservative activist Merle Terlesky for $100,000 jointly for publishing a letter by Terlesky which questioned Levant&#x27;s spending as publisher of the &quot;Western Standard&quot; and alleged that &quot;Ezra looks for any opportunity to poke a Muslim in the eye.&quot; Levant&#x27;s statement of claim said that he &quot;has been lowered in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally, and has been seriously injured in his credit, character and reputation and has been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt, and has suffered damages,&quot; including damage to his &quot;reputation as an entrepreneur.&quot; The suit was settled by an apology and paying Levant $5,000. Levant distinguished the two suits by saying that Terlesky made &quot;a false, factual claim&quot; and Levant&#x27;s motivation in suing was not political. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t an attempt to stop him from doing what he does as a living or a sideline. It was to correct a potentially devastating, bizarrely specific allegation of fraud on my part.&quot;

In her judgment against Levant, Judge Wendy Matheson of Ontario Superior Court ruled there is &quot;ample evidence before me demonstrating express malice on the part of [Mr. Levant]&quot;, especially the fact he &quot;did little or no fact-checking regarding the posts complained of, either before or after their publication&quot;. She found &quot;that [Mr. Levant&#x27;s] dominant motive in these blog posts was ill will, and that his repeated failure to take even basic steps to check his facts showed a reckless disregard for the truth&quot;. Levant &quot;ought to have been aware of the serious ramifications of his words on the reputation of this law student. Yet, at trial, he repeatedly tried to minimize his mistakes and his lack of diligence.&quot; The judge ordered Levant to remove the posts from his website within 15 days and pay Awan $50,000 in general damages plus $30,000 in aggravated damages.

The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed Levant&#x27;s appeal of the judgment on December 22, 2016, and ordered him to pay a further $15,000 in costs with all three judges on the panel ruling unanimously against Levant. On June 8, 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada denied Levant&#x27;s application for leave to appeal,
with costs.

===Richard Warman===
Lawyer Richard Warman filed suit against Levant in 2008 as well as Kathy Shaidle, Kate McMillan of Small Dead Animals and several other conservative bloggers for libel over statements made about Warman on Free Dominion.
Levant says this &quot;lawsuit isn&#x27;t logical, or serious. It&#x27;s a nuisance suit.&quot;

On June 10, 2015, Levant, Shaidle, and McMillan settled with Warman and published retractions and apologies. Levant&#x27;s apology was posted on his website and read:

===Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East===
A statement of claim for defamation was filed against Levant by Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East (CJPME) on December 22, 2016. The group alleges that Levant defamed them by comparing them to Nazis and calling them &quot;Jew-baiters&quot; over their campaign in support of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel due to that country&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians. CJPME is seeking $100,000 in damages and $20,000 for punitive or exemplary damages. In its statement of claim, CJPME asserts that BDS &quot;is not a criticism or attack on Jewish people or upon any person because of their religion or ethnicity&quot;, and that the group &quot;decries hatred, violence, racism and religious targeting of Jewish people in Canada and throughout the world&quot;. The lawsuit was settled in 2020.

===Robert Day and Adam Stirling===
Levant filed lawsuits, in June 2016, against Twitter users Adam Stirling and Robert Day for tweeting comments that alleged that not all money raised by Rebel Media&#x27;s crowdfunding campaign for victims of the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire were going to the Canadian Red Cross, as Levant had promised, and for claiming Levant had lied by promising that donors would be issued with tax receipts. Levant is suing Day and Stirling individually for $95,000 in damages each.

Day filed a motion to have the case dismissed under Ontario&#x27;s anti-SLAPP legislation, arguing that Levant&#x27;s suit was an attempt at lawfare intended to silence critics.

===Farhan Chak===

During a February 2014 broadcast of &quot;The Source&quot;, Levant stated that political science professor and former Liberal Party candidate Farhan Chak had &quot;shot up&quot; an Edmonton nightclub when he was 19 years old.

The accusation stemmed from a 1993 shooting incident at Barry T&#x27;s nightclub, resulting in Chak being charged with firing a shotgun at nightclub employees. Chak was later found not guilty. Levant also publicized the incident in a 2007 Western Standard blog post questioning whether Chak was &quot;a nut with a gun.&quot;

Chak filed suit against Levant and in 2021, was awarded $60,000 in damages by the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Alberta. In her decision, Justice Shaina Leonard ruled that Levant&#x27;s comments were not malicious, but &quot;careless&quot; and &quot;salacious.&quot; Leonard further questioned why the accusations about Chak &quot;were included in the Broadcast at all,&quot; since the show itself was about human rights commissions, a topic unrelated to Chak or the charges.

===Steven Guilbeault===
In March 2021, Levant sued Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault for blocking Levant on the social media platform Twitter on his individual account. Levant claimed that Guilbeault&#x27;s account was not a personal account but was functionally an official government account, and therefor should be accessible as a matter of freedom of expression. In September 2023, a settlement was reached where Guilbeault would unblock Levant as long as he remains a member of Parliament, and the government would pay Levant $20,000 for legal expenses.

==Canadian Broadcast Standards Council rulings==

===Chiquita complaint===
The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) determined that while hosting &quot;The Source&quot; in 2011, Levant violated the CBSC&#x27;s Code of Ethics by using a Spanish vulgarity on air (Sun News CBSC Rulings). The violation of the Code occurred on December 22, 2011, when Levant, in a commentary on &quot;The Source&quot;, blasted Chiquita Brands International and its ethical record after the company stated it would discontinue using oil produced from the Alberta oil sands. Speaking in Spanish, Levant told Chiquita executive Manuel Rodríguez, a Hispanic, &quot;chinga tu madre&quot; (&quot;go fuck your mother&quot;). The CBSC received 22 complaints about Levant&#x27;s use of the slur, a few noting that it is one of the nastiest insults in the Spanish language. Though Sun News and Levant went on to argue that the phrase can have several meanings, Levant later admitted he intended to use the term in its literal, most vulgar sense. With that, the CBSC determined in June 2012 that, though Levant had his right to criticize Chiquita and its management, his use of the Spanish vulgarity violated Clause 6 of the Code of Ethics, which requires &quot;full, fair and proper presentation of news, opinion, comment and editorial&quot; content; as a result, Sun News was required to issue an on-air announcement of the CBSC decision.

===&quot;Gypsy&quot; comments===
On September 5, 2012, Levant broadcast a commentary that he titled &quot;The Jew vs. the Gypsies&quot; on &quot;The Source&quot;, in which he accused the Romani people as a group of being criminals. Levant said, &quot;These are gypsies, a culture synonymous with swindlers. The phrase gypsy and cheater have been so interchangeable historically that the word has entered the English language as a verb: he gypped me. Gypsies are not a race. They&#x27;re a shiftless group of hobos. They rob people blind. Their chief economy is theft and begging. For centuries these roving highway gangs have mocked the law and robbed their way across Europe.&quot;

Following complaints, the &quot;Sun News Network&quot; removed the video from their webpage and issued an apology: &quot;Two weeks ago on the Sun News program &#x27;The Source&#x27; we looked at the issue of Canadian refugee claims by the Roma people. Following the broadcast we received a number of complaints from viewers who felt the broadcast reinforced negative stereotypes about the Roma people. We have completed a review of the material and we agree that this content was inappropriate and should not have gone to air. It was not the intent of Sun News, or anyone employed by Sun News, to promote negative stereotypes about the Roma people. We regret our error in these broadcasts, and we apologize unreservedly to the Roma people and to you, our viewers.&quot;

The Canadian Jewish Humanitarian and Relief Committee, founded by Avrum Rosensweig of Ve&#x27;ahavta, published an op-ed in the &quot;National Post&quot; which condemned Levant&#x27;s commentary as a &quot;contemptible screed&quot; and argued that &quot;[t]he time has come for all of us to reject hate and bigotry — against any group&quot;.

Gina Csanyi-Robah, executive director of the Roma Community Centre in Toronto, described the broadcast as &quot;nearly nine minutes of on-air racist hate-speech targeting our community&quot;, &quot;one of the longest and most sustained on-air broadcasts of hate-speech against any community in Canada that we&#x27;ve witnessed since our organization was established in 1997&quot; and as &quot;overtly racist, prejudicial, and demeaning.&quot; The centre filed complaints against Sun News with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and against Levant with the Alberta Law Society as well as with the Toronto Police Service.

In March 2013, Levant apologized for his remarks, stating that &quot;I attacked a particular group, and painted them all with the same brush. And to those I hurt, I&#x27;m sorry&quot; and expressed hope that this &quot;will serve as an example of what not to do when commenting on social issues.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Haroon Siddiqui reported that Csanyi-Robah claimed that the police and crown attorney had recommended hate charges be laid against Levant under the hate speech provisions in Section 319 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. However, in a subsequent meeting, Csanyi-Robah and another individual claimed that the Attorney-General of Ontario&#x27;s office declined to lay charges because of fears that the trial would become a &quot;bit of a [media] circus&quot;.

The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council subsequently ruled, in September 2013, that Levant&#x27;s broadcast was &quot;in violation of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Code of Ethics and Equitable Portrayal Code,&quot; and that his comments about the Roma were &quot;abusive and unduly discriminatory against an ethnic group, and violated other provisions of the [code] regarding negative portrayal, stereotyping, stigmatization and degradation.&quot; The council noted that Levant had already issued two on-air apologies, and as such, he would not be ordered to issue another.

===Broadcasting inaccurate information===
On January 23, 2013, Levant showed video of a protest that had occurred in front of the &quot;Sun News&quot; office in Toronto in which protesters objected to the Sun&#x27;s coverage of the Idle No More movement. Levant replayed the clip on a subsequent show and proceeded to identify one couple by name claiming that they were &quot;professional protesters&quot;. The couple subsequently contacted Sun to complain that it was not them in the clip, that they had not attended the protest nor even been in Toronto at the time and then complained to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council when the Sun did not correct their story. &quot;The CBSC&#x27;s National Specialty Services Panel concluded that Sun News Network breached Clause 6 of the CAB Code of Ethics for including inaccurate information in the talk show. Levant had acknowledged his error on the February 8 episode of &quot;The Source&quot;.&quot;

==Political activism==
===Uniting the right===
In 1996, Levant worked with David Frum to organize the &quot;Winds of Change&quot; conference in Calgary, an early attempt to encourage the Reform Party of Canada and Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to merge so that a united rightwing party could defeat the Liberal Party of Canada in the subsequent election. While unsuccessful, the conference anticipated future attempts at a Unite the Right movement which ultimately led to the formation of the Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. Levant supported Preston Manning&#x27;s United Alternative initiative in 1999, a more advanced attempt to unite the country&#x27;s conservative movement and was one of the leaders of the movement to create the Canadian Alliance as an attempt to broaden the party&#x27;s base.

===Political organizer and aide===
While he was a law student, Levant was an active political organizer in the Reform Party, and guided the successful attempts by Rahim Jaffer (as the campaign manager for his nomination in Edmonton-Strathcona and later as his communications-director during the 1997 Federal Election) and Rob Anders to win party nominations. In 1997, he went to Ottawa to work for the Reform Party, becoming a parliamentary aide to party leader Preston Manning and being put in charge of question period strategy. Along with newly elected MP&#x27;s Rob Anders, Jason Kenney and Rahim Jaffer, Levant was part of an up-and-coming group of young Reformers which pundits dubbed the &quot;Snack Pack&quot; due to their relative youth and obesity.

In 1999, after being dismissed as Preston Manning&#x27;s legislative-assistant, Levant left Ottawa to join the editorial board of the fledgling &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper in Toronto. A close friend of Stockwell Day&#x27;s son Logan, Levant proclaimed himself a &quot;Stockaholic&quot; and supported the elder Day in his successful attempt to defeat Reform Party leader Preston Manning for the leadership of the new Canadian Alliance.

In February 2001, he returned to Ottawa as communications director to Day. In May of that year he resigned after leaking to the &quot;National Post&quot; a letter that he sent to dissident MP Chuck Strahl in which he threatened to sue over Strahl&#x27;s criticisms of his office.

===Candidacy and resignation===
Later in 2001, Levant returned to Calgary to practise law. By February 2002 he had won the Canadian Alliance party nomination for the riding of Calgary Southwest, but stepped aside after public pressure so that new party leader Stephen Harper could run there in a 2002 by-election. When the by-election was called, Levant, who said he spent over $150,000 to gain the nomination, announced on March 28 that he would not step aside. Later that night, however, he relented after widespread pressure from the party and accusations that he was putting himself ahead of the party.

===Organizing rallies===
On December 4, 2016, Levant organized a political rally at the Legislature in Edmonton, Alberta, during which the crowd chanted &#x27;lock her up&#x27;, referring to Rachel Notley. Commentators were critical since Notley has never been accused of any crime. Commentators stated the rally imported the worst aspects of US politics into Canada.

===Arrest at anti-Israel protest===
On November 24, 2024, Levant was arrested by Toronto Police for &quot;inciting&quot; a crowd of anti-Israel protesters who had gathered in a Jewish neighbourhood centred around Bathurst Street and Sheppard Avenue in Toronto. Before being arrested, Levant had told the arresting officers that they were violating his Charter rights and that he &quot;hadn&#x27;t incited anything.&quot; After Levant resisted police orders to leave the immediate area, he was arrested and told that he was &quot;breaching the peace.&quot; Levant announced that he intends to sue the Toronto Police.

==Political views==
Levant has called himself a libertarian, saying he is &quot;basically someone who believes in freedom,&quot; although he says he is more &quot;mainstream conservative&quot; when it comes to social issues and foreign affairs. He has said, &quot;It&#x27;s tough to be a pure libertarian, because reality has a way of messing with that beautiful theory.&quot;

===Views on Quebec===
Levant favoured Quebec sovereignty and a yes vote during the 1995 Quebec referendum in a &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; column titled &quot;10 Reasons to Hope for a Yes Victory&quot; Among his 10 reasons were Levant&#x27;s views that the departure of Quebec from Canadian confederation would lead to the elimination of bilingualism and multiculturalism, that it would give the Canadian government the &quot;fortitude&quot; to say no to &quot;other special interest groups&quot; such as First Nations and environmentalists; it would end corruption in Parliament, which Levant blamed on Quebec politicians, and clear the way for Preston Manning to become Prime Minister of Canada.

In 1996, Levant wrote a column saying that if the federal Liberals were re-elected, Alberta could separate from Canada, making it &quot;free from Quebec&#x27;s demands.&quot;

===2012 American presidential election===
In a column on the eve of the 2012 presidential election, Levant wrote: &quot;America is resilient. But four more years of Obama will change that country deeply — and not for the better.&quot; He urged readers to oppose President Obama&#x27;s reelection. In the article, Levant stated of Obama that &quot;alone amongst modern presidents he has not visited Israel during his presidency.&quot; National Post columnist Chris Selley accused Levant of &quot;making up one of his patented &#x27;facts&#x27;&quot; and referred to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article that noted most American presidents since Israel&#x27;s founding in 1948 have not visited during their presidency; only Clinton and Carter visiting during their first terms. Levant predicted a Romney victory, with at least 295 electoral votes to 243 for Obama. He said that &quot;every poll that shows Obama ahead in battleground states is equally skewed&quot; and were biased in favour of Obama.

===Stance against the Alberta Human Rights Commission===
Levant is a fierce critic of the Alberta Human Rights Commission, particularly concerning Rev. Stephen Boissoin, who in the &quot;Lund v. Boissoin&quot; matter was fined $7,000 and banned from publicly &quot;disparaging ... gays and lesbians&quot; in May 2008. This case concerned a letter published by the &quot;Red Deer Advocate&quot; in 2002 in which Boissoin attacked the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot; as &quot;wicked&quot;. In June 2008, Levant republished Boissoin&#x27;s letter on his blog. When the AHRC dismissed the resulting complaint in November 2008, Levant accused the HRCs of religious discrimination, asserting that &quot;100% of the CHRC&#x27;s targets have been white, Christian or conservative&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s legal for a Jew like me to publish [Boissoin&#x27;s letter]. It&#x27;s illegal for a Christian like Rev. Boissoin to publish it.&quot; The HRC&#x27;s ruling was overturned by the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Alberta in 2009, on the grounds that Boissoin&#x27;s remarks were not hateful. In 2012, the Court of Appeal of Alberta upheld the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench decision.

Levant&#x27;s case has attracted the attention of organizations such as PEN Canada, the Canadian Association of Journalists, and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association — all of which have called for reform of the commissions. He was also featured on Glenn Beck&#x27;s former show on CNN.

===CBC opponent===
Sun Media, owned by Quebecor, systematically opposed funding for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in an on-air campaign led by Levant and Brian Lilley.

===Idle No More===

On January 20, 2013, Idle No More protesters confronted Ezra Levant at the Toronto Sun office as part of a larger protest against Sun Media. They claimed Sun Media and Levant had a racist agenda and protested commentary made both in the Sun newspaper and on the Sun News Network about &quot;the plight of Native Canadians, the funding of reserves, the Idle No More movement, and the ongoing hunger strike of Attawapiskat chief Theresa Spence.&quot; Levant responded to protesters saying he supports reforming the Indian Act, which he called racist. Levant later said the protesters were a &#x27;rent a mob&#x27; who were paid to attend any protest.

<doc id="952983" wikidata="Q1194041" url="?curid=952983" title="Luther's Large Catechism">
<text>Luther&#x27;s Large Catechism () is a catechism by Martin Luther. It consists of works written by Luther and compiled Christian canonical texts, published in April 1529. This book was addressed particularly to clergymen to aid them in teaching their congregations, and to fathers for instructing their families. Luther&#x27;s Large Catechism is divided into five parts: The Ten Commandments, The Apostles&#x27; Creed, The Lord&#x27;s Prayer, Holy Baptism, and The Sacrament of the Eucharist. The Large Catechism, along with related documents, was published in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; in 1580.

The author stipulates in the preface:
Therefore it is the duty of every father of a family to question and examine his children and servants at least once a week and to ascertain what they know of [this catechism], or are learning, and, if they do not know it, to keep them faithfully at it.Luther adds:However, it is not enough for them to comprehend and recite these parts according to the words only, but the young people should also be made to attend the preaching, especially during the time which is devoted to the Catechism, that they may hear it explained and may learn to understand what every part contains, so as to be able to recite it as they have heard it, and, when asked, may give a correct answer, so that the preaching may not be without profit and fruit.

<doc id="952984" wikidata="Q282739" url="?curid=952984" title="Pan-Africanism">
<text>Pan-Africanism is a nationalist movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous peoples and diasporas of African ancestry. Based on a common goal dating back to the Atlantic slave trade and the Trans-Saharan slave trade, the movement extends beyond continental Africans with a substantial support base among the African diaspora in the Americas and Europe.

Pan-Africanism is said to have its origins in the struggles of the African people against enslavement and colonization and this struggle may be traced back to the first resistance on slave ships—rebellions and suicides—through the constant plantation and colonial uprisings and the &quot;Back to Africa&quot; movements of the 19th century. Based on the belief that unity is vital to economic, social, and political progress, it aims to &quot;unify and uplift&quot; people of African ancestry.

At its core, pan-Africanism is a belief that &quot;African people, both on the continent and in the diaspora, share not merely a common history, but a common destiny.&quot; Pan-Africanism posits a sense of a shared historical fate for Africans in the Americas, the West Indies, and on the continent, itself centered on the Atlantic trade in slaves, African slavery, and European imperialism.

Pan-African thought influenced the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (since succeeded by the African Union) in 1963. The African Union Commission has its seat in Addis Ababa and the Pan-African Parliament has its seat in Midrand, Johannesburg.

==Overview==
Pan-Africanism stresses the need for &quot;collective self-reliance&quot;. Pan-Africanism exists as a governmental and grassroots objective. Pan-African advocates include leaders such as Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Henri Christophe, François Duvalier, Aimé Césaire, Haile Selassie, Jomo Kenyatta, Edward Wilmot Blyden, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Patrice Lumumba, Julius Nyerere, Robert Sobukwe, Ahmed Sékou Touré, Kwame Nkrumah, King Sobhuza II, Robert Mugabe, Thomas Sankara, Kwame Ture, Dr. John Pombe Magufuli, Muammar Gaddafi, Walter Rodney, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, grassroots organizers such as Joseph Robert Love, Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X, academics such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Anténor Firmin and others in the diaspora. Pan-Africanists believe that solidarity will enable the continent to fulfil its potential to independently provide for all its people. Crucially, an all-African alliance would empower African people globally.

The realization of the pan-African objective would lead to &quot;power consolidation in Africa&quot;, which &quot;would compel a reallocation of global resources, as well as unleashing a fiercer psychological energy and political assertion ... that would unsettle social and political (power) structures...in the Americas&quot;.

Advocates of pan-Africanism—i.e. &quot;pan-Africans&quot; or &quot;pan-Africanists&quot;—often champion socialist principles and tend to be opposed to external political and economic involvement on the continent. Critics accuse the ideology of homogenizing the experience of people of African ancestry. They also point to the difficulties of reconciling current divisions within countries on the continent and within communities in the diaspora.

==History==

As a philosophy, pan-Africanism represents the aggregation of the historical, cultural, spiritual, artistic, scientific, and philosophical legacies of Africans from past times to the present. Pan-Africanism as an ethical system traces its origins from ancient times, and promotes values that are the product of the African civilisations and the struggles against slavery, racism, colonialism, and neocolonialism.

Coinciding with numerous New World slave insurrections (hallmarked by the Haitian Revolution), the end of the 19th century birthed an intercontinental pro-African political movement that sought to unify disparate campaigns in the goal to end oppression. It was their removal from the continent that enabled them to view it as a whole. Another important political form of a religious pan-Africanist worldview appeared in the form of Ethiopianism. In London, the Sons of Africa was a political group addressed by Quobna Ottobah Cugoano in the 1791 edition of his book &quot;Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil of Slavery&quot;. The group addressed meetings and organised letter-writing campaigns, published campaigning material and visited parliament. They wrote to figures such as Granville Sharp, William Pitt and other members of the white abolition movement, as well as King George III and the Prince of Wales, the future George IV.

Modern pan-Africanism began around the start of the 20th century. The African Association, later renamed the Pan-African Association, was established around 1897 by Henry Sylvester Williams, who organized the First Pan-African Conference in London in 1900.

The Pan-African Congress series of meetings followed 1900&#x27;s First Pan-African Conference that was held in London. A meeting of the Congress in 1919 in Paris (1st Pan-African Congress), 1921 in London (2nd Pan-African Congress), 1923 in London (3rd Pan-African Congress), 1927 in New York City (4th Pan-African Congress), and 1945 in Manchester (5th Pan-African Congress) advanced the issue of decolonisation in Africa.

Among inhabitants of the continent, it was the shared experience of colonial rule and resistance to it that fostered a unified African identity. In the 1930s, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe&#x27;s anti-colonial writings from the United States, Accra, and Lagos established him as the most prominent pan-Africanist in the British West Africa. Then-Colonial Secretary Oliver Stanley called Azikiwe (Zik) &quot;the biggest danger of the lot.&quot; Zik drew his inspiration on the pan-African ideas of West Indians and African-Americans such as Edward Wilmot Blyden, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey, as well as West Africans such as J.E. Casely Hayford and his allies in the National Congress of British West Africa. In his publication &quot;Renascent Africa&quot;, he offered a vague program for a &quot;New Africa,&quot; modeled on the New Negro Movement articulated by Alain Locke. Outside his writings, Azikiwe actively participated in pan-African politics, promulgating intellectually, in person around the Black Atlantic from West Africa and the Caribbean to the United States and western Europe.

The Fifth Pan-African Congress was a significant gathering, which brought together anti-colonial activists from the African continent and the Diaspora. Women such as Amy Ashwood Garvey and Amy Jacques Garvey helped to organise the Congress meeting and played a crucial role in the conferences.

With the independence of Ghana in March 1957, Kwame Nkrumah was elected as the first Prime Minister and President of the State. Nkrumah emerged as a major advocate for the unity of Independent Africa. The Ghanaian President embodied a political activist approach to pan-Africanism as he championed the &quot;quest for regional integration of the whole of the African continent&quot;. This period represented a &quot;golden age of high pan-African ambitions&quot;; the continent had experienced revolution and decolonization from Western powers and the narrative of rebirth and solidarity had gained momentum within the pan-African movement.

Nkrumah&#x27;s pan-African principles intended for a union between the Independent African states upon a recognition of their commonality (i.e. suppression under imperialism). Pan-Africanism under Nkrumah evolved past the assumptions of a racially exclusive movement associated with black Africa, and adopted a political discourse of regional unity

In April 1958, Nkrumah hosted the first All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference (AAPC) in Accra, Ghana. This Conference invited delegates of political movements and major political leaders. With the exception of South Africa, all independent states of the African continent attended: Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Liberia, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan. This conference signified a monumental event in the pan-African movement, as it revealed a political and social union between those considered Arabic states and the black African regions. Further, the Conference espoused a common African Nationalist identity, among the States, of unity and anti-Imperialism. Frantz Fanon, journalist, freedom fighter and a member of the Algerian FLN party attended the conference as a delegate for Algeria.

Considering the armed struggle of the FLN against French colonial rule, the Conference attendees agreed to support the struggle of those States under colonial oppression. This encouraged the commitment of direct involvement in the &quot;emancipation of the Continent; thus, a fight against colonial pressures on South Africa was declared and the full support of the FLN struggle in Algeria, against French colonial rule&quot;. Tom Mboya, a Kenyan trade unionist and anti-colonial activist, also attended this conference. This visit inspired him to increase the pace of political activity aimed at agitating for Kenya&#x27;s independence.

In the years following 1958, Accra Conference also marked the establishment of a new foreign policy of non-alignment between the US and USSR, and the will to establish an &quot;African Identity&quot; in global affairs by advocating unity between the African States on international relations. &quot;This would be based on the Bandung Declaration, the Charter of the UN and on loyalty to UN decisions.&quot;

In 1959, Nkrumah, President Sékou Touré of Guinea and President William Tubman of Liberia met at Sanniquellie and signed the Sanniquellie Declaration outlining the principles for the achievement of the unity of Independent African States whilst maintaining a national identity and autonomous constitutional structure. The Declaration called for a revised understanding of Pan-Africanism and the uniting of the independent states.

In 1960, the second All-African Peoples&#x27; Conference was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The membership of the All-African Peoples&#x27; Organisation (AAPO) had increased with the inclusion of the &quot;Algerian Provisional Government (as they had not yet won independence), Cameroun, Guinea, Nigeria, Somalia and the United Arab Republic&quot;. The Conference highlighted diverging ideologies within the movement, as Nkrumah&#x27;s call for a political and economic union between the Independent African States gained little agreement. The disagreements following 1960 gave rise to two rival factions within the pan-African movement: the Casablanca Bloc and the Brazzaville Bloc.

In 1962, Algeria gained independence from French colonial rule and Ahmed Ben Bella assumed the Presidency. Ben Bella was a strong advocate for Pan-Africanism and African Unity. Following the FLN&#x27;s armed struggle for liberation, Ben Bella spoke at the UN and espoused for Independent Africa&#x27;s role in providing military and financial support to the African liberation movements opposing apartheid and fighting Portuguese colonialism.
In search of a united voice, in 1963 at an African Summit conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 32 African states met and established the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The creation of the OAU Charter took place at this Summit and defines a coordinated &quot;effort to raise the standard of living of member States and defend their sovereignty&quot; by supporting freedom fighters and decolonisation. Thus, was the formation of the African Liberation Committee (ALC), during the 1963 Summit. Championing the support of liberation movements, was Algeria&#x27;s President Ben Bella, immediately &quot;donated 100 million francs to its finances and was one of the first countries, of the Organisation to boycott Portuguese and South African goods&quot;.

In 1969, Algiers hosted the Pan-African Cultural Festival, on July 21 and it continued for eight days. At this moment in history, Algeria stood as a &quot;beacon of African and Third-World militancy,&quot; and would come to inspire fights against colonialism around the world. The festival attracted thousands from African states and the African Diaspora, including the Black Panthers. It represented the application of the tenets of the Algerian revolution to the rest of Africa and symbolized the reshaping of the definition of pan-African identity under the common experience of colonialism. The Festival further strengthened the standing of Algeria&#x27;s President Boumediene in Africa and the Third World.
After the death of Kwame Nkrumah in 1972, Muammar Gaddafi assumed the mantle of leader of the Pan-Africanist movement and became the most outspoken advocate of African Unity, like Nkrumah before him – for the advent of a &quot;United States of Africa&quot;.

It was not until the Seventh Pan-African Congress in 1994, which was held in Uganda, that women&#x27;s issues were specifically addressed. For the first time, the Congress was asked to reflect upon the role and needs of women. In order to organise which women&#x27;s issues would be raised at the Congress, a pre-Congress Women&#x27;s Meeting was held two days before, to provide a framework that ensured women&#x27;s voices and concerns were listened to. More than 300 people, 74 percent of whom were women, attended the pre-Congress meeting. This meeting was primarily attended by Ugandan women, who set their own agenda, which was focused on women&#x27;s issues such as genital mutilation and the protection of young domestic workers from rape and other abuse. Women participants of the Seventh Pan-African Congress moved towards building an agenda for the Pan African Women&#x27;s Liberation Organisation and met daily during the Congress to discuss the logistics of such a movement. The pre-existing Pan African Women&#x27;s Organisation primarily consisted of the wives of heads of states, ministers, and other high-ranking women.

In the United States, the term is closely associated with Afrocentrism, an ideology of African-American identity politics that emerged during the civil rights movement of the 1960s to 1970s.

Although Pan-Africanism called for unity between all those of African ancestry, it missed out almost half of these people by overlooking women&#x27;s contribution. In the book Pan-Africanism History: Political Figures from Africa and the Diaspora since 1787, it mentioned forty Pan-Africanists, of which only three were women. Due to the lack of representation paid to women in Pan- Africanism, Clenora Hudson-Weems coined the term Africana Womanism in the 1980s, which is an ideology that specifically focuses on black women&#x27;s achievements and gains, similar to the ones mentioned below.

==Important women in pan-Africanism==
Pan-Africanism has seen the contribution of numerous female African activists throughout its lifespan, despite the systemic lack of attention paid to them by scholars and male pan-Africanist alike.

Amy Jacques Garvey, who founded the international newspaper &quot;Negro World&quot;, was heavily involved in other Pan-Africanism organisations, such as the anti-colonial and anti-imperialist International African Service Bureau. She also helped organise the Fifth Pan-African Congress. Amy Jacques Garvey used her platform to spread Pan-Africanism globally and used her position as editor for the &quot;Negro World&quot; to write a column called &quot;Our Women and what they think&quot;, dedicated to black women.

Claudia Jones was another pan-Africanist. In order to fight against racism towards black people in Britain, Jones set up the &quot;West Indian Gazette&quot;, which sought to cover topics such as the realities of South African apartheid and decolonisation. Notable male Pan-Africanists, such as Kwame Nkrumah, were influenced by Jones as she incorporated Marxist- Leninist philosophy into Pan-Africanism.

In the United States, Audley Moore and Dara Abubakari played a vital role in developing Pan-African thought. These women significantly shaped the ideological and organizational contours of Pan-Africanism, developing a gender-conscious strand of Pan-Africanism that was focused on the realities faced by African-American women, separate from those of African-American men. Both Moore and Abubakari were prominent members of the Universal Association of Ethiopian Women in Louisiana, which engaged in anti-colonial activities, welfare rights, and Pan-Africanist activism. In 1972, Moore was a featured speaker at the All-Africa Women&#x27;s Conference in Dar es Salaam where she encouraged solidarity among women across the continent and demanded the inclusion of African American women into the conversation, emphasising that they too were committed to liberating Africa.

In the Caribbean, Peggy Antrobus lobbied policymakers to highlight that Caribbean women were the poorest in the Caribbean and that UNICEF was the first international organization to draw attention to the negative impact of structural adjustment on the poor, particularly women.

Alice Victoria Alexander Kinloch was born in 1863 in Cape Town, South Africa, before her family moved to Kimberley. The racist and segregated environment shaped her activism on systemic oppression in South Africa. In June 1885 she married Edmund Ndosa Kinloch, a diamond miner who worked at the De Beers mining compound in Kimberley. She witnessed the degrading working conditions of the compound premised upon the exploitation of black South Africans, such as the practice of making hundreds of black miners attend work naked to ensure diamonds were not being stolen. Kinloch wrote two articles in 1896, after moving to Britain in 1895, for the society named &quot;The Recognition of the Brotherhood of Man&quot;, which was well received and earned her high praise from the editors. Her experiences and clear articulation of the South African political situation both through literature and speeches resonated with the British liberal intelligentsia. Kinloch frequently made efforts to engage in dialogue with activist groups in England. She spoke at Newcastle, York and Manchester for the Aborigines Protection Society which led to a resolution being passed that demanded the British government to end racial oppression in South Africa.

Kinloch&#x27;s detailed accounts of the nature of black oppression in Africa was unprecedented for these organisations who rarely had the opportunity to hear first-hand accounts of the African political situation. Now fully engrossed in the British anti-colonial dialogue, she wrote a 19-page pamphlet on the diamond trade in South Africa was in 1897, her views were beginning to become distinctly Pan-African in their calls for an end to continental dehumanisation. Kinloch&#x27;s main contribution to pan-Africanism however was in her co-founding of the African Association in 1897 with lawyers Henry Sylvester Williams and Thomas J. Thompson, where they and 11 or 12 others gathered at the Charing-Cross Mansions hotel in London. Kinloch served as treasurer but in 1898 returned to South Africa with her husband. Two years later, the African Association led the Pan-African Conference, which was widely regarded as the beginning of 20th-century Pan-Africanism. Dr Tshepo Mvulane Moloi calls Kinloch the &quot;founding mother of Pan-Africanism&quot;.

Jeanne Martin Cissé was instrumental in the independence of Guinea and in bringing African women&#x27;s rights to the forefront of the colonial debate, for example influencing Guinea&#x27;s protection of women&#x27;s rights enshrined in its constitution. Central to Cissé&#x27;s work was the idea that the UN could provide an international framework that would protect African girls and women from issues such as forced marriage. In response to rapidly increasing birth rates, while in government, she stressed the importance of family planning and legislated sex education in Guinea&#x27;s primary schools, despite strong opposition from the Muslim majority population. In an article written in 1979, on the family dynamic in Africa, Cissé makes unprecedented criticisms of the forced role of mothers in brainwashing their daughters to follow prescriptive gender roles. She was also instrumental in the 1968 legislation in Guinea which outlawed polygamy, believing it would effectively combat the widespread abandonment of families by fathers, thus relieving the physical burden mothers faced in Guinea. On the international level, Cissé was the first African president of the United Nations Security Council in 1972 and succeeded in passing two resolutions, condemning Israel&#x27;s aggression against Palestine, and Apartheid in South Africa. She also drafted and helped pass the UN Convention on Consent and Minimum Age for Marriage in 1964, which provided a wide framework for legislation across Africa.

Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti (FRK) was born in 1900 and studied in England in 1922. She returned to her home town of Abeokuta, in the Ogun state region of Nigeria, where she began her extensive work in Nigerian and international activism. Her achievements were unprecedented: being the first woman with a top-ranking position in a leading political party (the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons), the first woman to drive a car in Nigeria, and the first African woman to travel to the Eastern Bloc, visiting China and Russia during the Cold War. Her son, Fela Kuti, became a world-renowned musician and founder of the genre called Afrobeat, a political musical movement that was intensely Pan-African. Scholars who study the life of FRK and her son conclusively agree that she was the main political influence on the Pan-African and political dimension to his music. In 1949, FRK founded and led the Nigerian Women&#x27;s Union which in 1953 changed its name to the Federation of Nigerian Women&#x27;s Societies, rallying for inter-regional unity among women&#x27;s movements in Nigeria. Subsequently, she was courted by international movements for women&#x27;s rights such as the Women&#x27;s International Democratic Federation (WIDF) and the Wom&#x27;n&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom. She also became embroiled in the politics of Ghana, where she became a friend of the leading African voice on Pan Africanism and president of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah, who credited her &#x27;with being an inspiration to the Ghana Women&#x27;s Association.&#x27; One of her most notable contributions was the formation of the Abeokuta Ladies Club - this was a collective of Nigerian market women, whose powerful economic position in Abeokuta sought to influence the colonial policy which destroyed their ability to make money and remain independent. By the 1940s, more than 20,000 women had a membership. She changed the name to the Abeokuta Women&#x27;s Union, marking the movement towards direct activism. For example, in November 1947, she was responsible for organising demonstrations that as many as 10,000 women participated. She continued to organise for women&#x27;s rights all her life until in 1977, when a government raid conducted in response to her son Fela Kuti&#x27;s activism, led to her being thrown from a second storey window. She died from her injuries in 1978.

== Pan-Africanism in the 21st century ==

=== Social media and the internet ===
Since the onset of the digital revolution, the internet and other similar media have facilitated the growth of many core pan-African principles by strengthening and increasing connections between people across the diaspora. Although internet penetration rates remain below the world average, roughly 43 percent of the population of Africa uses the internet and social media with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube being among the most popular social networking sites. The ability to connect with people thousands of miles away has allowed these platforms to become places where people across the continent and diaspora have attempted to manufacture a collective African identity. Twitter has been one of the biggest sites where this production is taking place. In July 2015, Botswana satirical writer and speaker Siyanda Mohutsiwa posed a question on her Twitter account that led to the creation of the hashtag #IfAfricaWasABar. After one week, more than 60,000 tweets with the hashtag were created, which allowed users on the platform to grapple with a vision of widespread African interaction throughout the continent. Nigerian artist Burna boy&#x27;s guiding philosophy is Pan-Africanism, as he firmly believes in rebuilding
bridges with the African Diaspora, viewing Africa
as the Mother Continent and birthplace of
humankind.

The intersection between the digital media revolution and pan-Africanism has also had implications for the education sector. Pan-African organizations have used the internet and digital media to produce educational content for both children and adults in an effort to improve learning outcomes across the continent. The most popular is Ubongo which is Africa&#x27;s largest manufacturer of educational content for children and uses shows such as &quot;Akil and Me&quot; to help Africa&#x27;s youth improve literacy outcomes. The results have been widespread with Ubongo claiming that 24 million children have displayed enhanced learning outcomes and a study in Tanzania finding an association between improved mathematics skills and children consuming Ubongo&#x27;s content.

=== African Union ===
Pan-African thought influenced the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (now the African Union) in 1963. One of the biggest goals that the African Union has set for the continent in the 21st century is improving long-term economic growth. Major steps have been taken to address this issue particularly with the creation of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA). The establishment of this free trade zone connects nations throughout the continent that together have a GDP of upwards of US$2.5 trillion. The emergence of COVID-19 has delayed its implementation but in the long term, the African Union hopes that the agreement will spur industrialization, substantially boost trade, and contribute to increasing economic integration throughout the continent.

The African Union has also sought to make changes on policies involving movement within the continent. Similar to the current agreement in the European Union, the African Union proposed a free movement policy that would allow residents of countries in the union to move throughout the continent freely and participate in economic endeavors in other countries. The majority of countries have not formally signed off on the agreement and others are critical of the prospects of success but the African Union continues to view this policy as a major step toward its goal of continent wide solidarity and integration.

Although in an era of globalization and increased connectivity, challenges continue to persist that undermine the African Union&#x27;s goal of continent wide solidarity. Many of these challenges have persisted for decades with some including inconsistent treaty implementation, ineffective governance and continued involvement from foreign economic superpowers amongst others. Influence from the United States, the United Kingdom and France continues to remain while new countries such as China are increasingly becoming involved politically and economically on the continent with many referring to this era as a &quot;new scramble for Africa&quot;.

==Concept==

As originally conceived by Henry Sylvester Williams (although some historians credit the idea to Edward Wilmot Blyden), pan-Africanism referred to the unity of all continental Africa.

During apartheid South Africa there was a Pan Africanist Congress led by Robert Sobukwe that dealt with the oppression of Africans in South Africa under Apartheid rule. Other pan-Africanist organisations include: Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, TransAfrica and the International People&#x27;s Democratic Uhuru Movement.

Additionally, pan-Africanism is seen as an endeavour to return to what is deemed by its proponents as singular, traditional African concepts about culture, society, and values. Examples of this include Léopold Sédar Senghor&#x27;s &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, and Mobutu Sese Seko&#x27;s view of &quot;Authenticité&quot;.

An important theme running through much pan-Africanist literature concerns the historical links between different countries on the continent and the benefits of cooperation as a way of resisting imperialism and colonialism.

Some universities went as far as creating &quot;Departments of Pan-African Studies&quot; in the late 1960s. This includes the California State University, where that department was founded in 1969 as a direct reaction to the civil rights movement, and is today dedicated to &quot;teaching students about the African World Experience&quot;, to &quot;demonstrate to the campus and the community the richness, vibrance, diversity, and vitality of African, African American, and Caribbean cultures&quot; and to &quot;presenting students and the community with an Afrocentric analysis&quot; of anti-Black racism.
Syracuse University also offers a master&#x27;s degree in Pan African Studies.

==Pan-African colours==
One of the earliest flags used to represent pan-Africanism is the UNIA (Universal Negro Improvement Association) flag, is a tri-color flag consisting of three equal horizontal bands of (from top-down) red, black and green. The UNIA formally adopted it on August 13, 1920, during its month-long convention at Madison Square Garden in New York.

Variations of the pan-African colours have been applied to create flags in various countries and territories in Africa and the Americas to represent Black Nationalist ideologies. Among these are the flags of Malawi, Kenya, South Sudan and Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several pan-African organizations and movements have also often employed the emblematic red, black and green tri-color scheme in variety of contexts.

Another flag that inspired pan-African groups is the horizontal tricolor of green, yellow and red. This colour combination was originally adopted from the 1897 flag of Ethiopia, and was inspired by the fact that Ethiopia is the continent&#x27;s oldest independent nation.

==Criticism==

Pan-Africanism has been accused of being a movement of the African educated bourgeois elite which doesn&#x27;t concern itself with the interests of ordinary Africans. Kenyan left-wing journalist Philip Ochieng wrote in 1971, 

Kwame Nkrumah was viewed with suspicion by many of his contemporaries, who regarded him as a &quot;megalomaniac whose only real ambition is to rule the entire African continent&quot;. Most newly independent African countries opposed Nkrumah&#x27;s desires for a politically unified Africa because they viewed it as a threat to their national sovereignty. Ivorian president Félix Houphouët-Boigny was a staunch opponent of Nkrumah, and the two came into conflict with each other.

Pan-Africanist organisations such as the Organization of African Unity have been accused by people such as Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere of being a &quot;committee of dictators&quot; that doesn&#x27;t protect the rights of Africans. African leaders who served as chairpersons of the Organization of African Unity and the African Union such as Ugandan president Idi Amin, Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, and Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi have been accused of severe human rights violations while using Pan-Africanist rhetoric to legitimize their authority. Malawian economist Thandika Mkandawire states,
Another criticism of Pan-Africanism is that it is irrelevant for contemporary issues affecting postcolonial Africa, and it is thus &quot;stuck in the past&quot;. Pan-Africanism has been accused of placing too much focus on a superficial monolithic &quot;African&quot; or &quot;black&quot; identity while ignoring the complex ethno-religious differences and conflicts that exist among Africans (especially in Nigeria, where independence leaders abandoned national unity after independence in favour of promoting the interests of their own ethnic groups over others), and it has been noted that the ideology relies on constructing a &quot;common foe&quot; such as colonialism in order to maintain its relevance and legitimacy.

===In the United States===
The Council on African Affairs (CAA): founded in 1937 by Max Yergan and Paul Robeson, the CAA was the first major U.S. organization whose focus was on providing pertinent and up-to-date information about pan-Africanism across the United States, particularly to African Americans. Perhaps the most successful campaign of the council was for South African famine relief in 1946. The CAA was hopeful that, following World War II, there would be a move towards Third World independence under the trusteeship of the United Nations. To the CAA&#x27;s dismay, the proposals introduced by the U.S. government to the conference in April/May 1945 set no clear limits on the duration of colonialism and no motions towards allowing territorial possessions to move towards self-government.

Liberal supporters abandoned the CAA, and the federal government cracked down on its operations. In 1953, the CAA was charged with subversion under the McCarran Internal Security Act. Its principal leaders, including Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Alphaeus Hunton (1903–70), were subjected to harassment, indictments, and in the case of Hunton, imprisonment. Under the weight of internal disputes, government repression, and financial hardships, the Council on African Affairs disbanded in 1955.
* The US Organization was founded in 1965 by Maulana Karenga, following the Watts riots. It is based on the synthetic African philosophy of kawaida, and is perhaps best known for creating Kwanzaa and the &quot;Nguzo Saba&quot; (&quot;seven principles&quot;). In the words of its founder and chair, Karenga, &quot;the essential task of our organization Us has been and remains to provide a philosophy, a set of principles and a program which inspires a personal and social practice that not only satisfies human need but transforms people in the process, making them self-conscious agents of their own life and liberation&quot;.
* TransAfrica is a non-profit organization founded in 1977 by Randall Robinson that strives to provide political and economic aid to those of African diaspora groups. The social justice group raises awareness of diasporan happenings through legal action and educating Afro-descendants on the domestic and foreign policy of the United States that directly affect them. By creating more engagement between Africans and people of African ancestry to policymakers, TransAfrica seeks to create more sustainable, independent, and progressive development for these ethnic groups.

==Pan-African concepts and philosophies==
===Maafa studies===
Maafa is an aspect of pan-African studies. The term collectively refers to 500 years of suffering (including the present) of people of African heritage through slavery, imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of oppression. In this area of study, both the actual history and the legacy of that history are studied as a single discourse. The emphasis in the historical narrative is on African agents, as opposed to non-African agents.

===Afrocentric pan-Africanism===
Afrocentric pan-Africanism is espoused by Kwabena Faheem Ashanti in his book &quot;The Psychotechnology of Brainwashing: Crucifying Willie Lynch&quot;. Another newer movement that has evolved from the early Afrocentric school is the Afrisecal movement or Afrisecaism of Francis Ohanyido, a Nigerian philosopher-poet. Black nationalism is sometimes associated with this form of Pan-Africanism.

===Kawaida===

Kawaida, a Swahili word meaning &quot;usually&quot;, is a pan-Africanist nationalist and academic movement that was created during the height of the Black Power movement by Africana professor, author, and activist Maulana Karenga. The philosophy encourages the reclamation of traditional African thought with the belief it will empower Afro-descendants to sustain their fight against racism and other fundamental issues.

===Hip-hop===
Since the late 1970s, hip hop has emerged as a powerful force that has partly shaped black identity worldwide. In his 2005 article &quot;Hip-hop Turns 30: Whatcha Celebratin&#x27; For?&quot;, Greg Tate describes hip-hop culture as the product of a pan-African state of mind. It is an &quot;ethnic enclave/empowerment zone that has served as a foothold for the poorest among us to get a grip on the land of the prosperous&quot;.

Hip-hop unifies those of African descent globally in its movement towards greater economic, social and political power. Andreana Clay in her article &quot;Keepin&#x27; it Real: Black Youth, Hip-Hop Culture, and Black Identity&quot; states that hip-hop provides the world with &quot;vivid illustrations of Black lived experience&quot;, creating bonds of black identity across the globe. From a pan-African perspective, hip-hop culture can be a conduit to authenticate a black identity, and in doing so, creates a unifying and uplifting force among Africans that pan-Africanism sets out to achieve.

An expansion in the popularity of hip-hop culture in the 21st century has also increased the role hip-hop is playing for pan-African solidarity across the diaspora although the opportunity for a greater Pan-African involvement remains. At a conference at Howard University on March 4, 2016, Assistant Professor of African Studies Msia K. Clark spoke of the historical connection that has linked pan-Africanism and hip-hop since the genre&#x27;s birth and how hip-hop culture has been at the forefront of various movements throughout the continent in the 21st century. One of these movements involved Y&#x27;en a Marre, which was a collection of mainly Senegalese rap artists that are attributed with helping to remove former President Abdoulaye Wade from office in 2012 through the mass electoral mobilization of Senegal&#x27;s youth.

=== Economic development ===
The strength of African countries is dependent on economic stability. This in return draws from the ability to make use of and to manage available resources. Most and foremost African countries need more water security to ensure provision of clean water for households and sufficient water for food production and animal husbandry. To this end practices, technologies and utilities for water management have to be implemented on residential, municipal and national levels.

Countless scientists, engineers and other experts work in the water sectors to provide for the local populations and the industry. A new generation of experts who understand the water-soil-tree nexus or the building-water-tree nexus are successfully creating naturally re-generated areas that provide safe and clean water for rural populations while at the same time growing trees and reversing soil-erosion.

<text>Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism () is a catechism written by Martin Luther and published in 1529 for the training of children. Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism reviews the Ten Commandments, the Apostles&#x27; Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Sacrament of Holy Baptism, the Office of the Keys and Confession and the Sacrament of the Eucharist. It is included in the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; as an authoritative statement of what Lutherans believe. 

The Small Catechism is widely used today in Lutheran churches as part of youth education and Confirmation. It was mandatory for confirmands in the Church of Sweden until the 1960s. It has been translated into most European languages.

<doc id="952987" wikidata="Q452116" url="?curid=952987" title="Julia Robinson">
<text>Julia Hall Bowman Robinson (December 8, 1919July 30, 1985) was an American mathematician noted for her contributions to the fields of computability theory and computational complexity theory—most notably in decision problems. Her work on Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem (now known as Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem or the MRDP theorem) played a crucial role in its ultimate resolution. Robinson was a 1983 MacArthur Fellow.

== Early years ==
Robinson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of Ralph Bowers Bowman and Helen (Hall) Bowman. Her father owned a machine equipment company while her mother was a school teacher before marriage. Her mother died when Robinson was 2 years old and her father remarried. Her older sister was the mathematical popularizer and biographer Constance Reid and her younger sister is Billie Comstock.

When she was 9 years old, she was diagnosed with scarlet fever, which was shortly followed by rheumatic fever. This caused her to miss two years of school. When she was well again, she was privately tutored by a retired primary school teacher. In just one year, she was able to complete fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth year curriculum. While in junior high school, she was given an IQ test in which she scored a 98, a couple points below average, which she explains away as being &quot;unaccustomed to taking tests.&quot; Nevertheless, Julia stood out in San Diego High School as the only female student taking advanced classes in mathematics and physics. She graduated high school with a Bausch-Lomb award for being overall outstanding in science.

In 1936, Robinson entered San Diego State University at the age of 16. Dissatisfied with the mathematics curriculum at San Diego State University, she transferred to University of California, Berkeley in 1939 for her senior year. Before she was able to transfer to UC Berkeley, her father committed suicide in 1937 due to financial insecurities. She took five mathematics courses in her first year at Berkeley, one being a number theory course taught by Raphael M. Robinson. She received her BA degree in 1940, and later married Raphael in 1941.

==Mathematical contributions==

After graduating, Robinson continued in graduate studies at Berkeley. As a graduate student, Robinson was employed as a teaching assistant with the Department of Mathematics and later as a statistics lab assistant by Jerzy Neyman in the Berkeley Statistical Laboratory, where her work resulted in her first published paper, titled &quot;A Note on Exact Sequential Analysis&quot;.

Robinson received her PhD degree in 1948 under Alfred Tarski with a dissertation on &quot;Definability and Decision Problems in Arithmetic&quot;.
Her dissertation showed that the theory of the rational numbers was an undecidable problem, by demonstrating that elementary number theory could be defined in terms of the rationals. (Elementary number theory was already known to be undecidable by Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem.)

Here is an excerpt from her thesis:&quot;This consequence of our discussion is interesting because of a result of Gödel which shows that the variety of relations between integers (and operations on integers) which are arithmetically definable in terms of addition and multiplication of integers is very great. For instance from Theorem 3.2 and Gödel&#x27;s result, we can conclude that the relation which holds between three rationals &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; if and only if &quot;N&quot; is a positive integer and &quot;A&quot;=&quot;B&quot;&quot;N&quot; is definable in the arithmetic of rationals.&quot;

===Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem===
Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem asks for an algorithm to determine whether a Diophantine equation has any solutions in integers. Robinson began exploring methods for this problem in 1948 while at the RAND Corporation. Her work regarding Diophantine representation for exponentiation and her method of using Pell&#x27;s equation led to the J.R. hypothesis (named after Robinson) in 1950. Proving this hypothesis would be central in the eventual solution. Her research publications would lead to collaborations with Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and Yuri Matiyasevich.

In 1950, Robinson first met Martin Davis, then an instructor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was trying to show that all sets with listability property were Diophantine in contrast to Robinson&#x27;s attempt to show that a few special sets—including prime numbers and the powers of 2—were Diophantine. Robinson and Davis started collaborating in 1959 and were later joined by Hilary Putnam, they then showed that the solutions to a “Goldilocks” equation was key to Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem.

In 1970, the problem was resolved in the negative; that is, they showed that no such algorithm can exist. Through the 1970s, Robinson continued working with Matiyasevich on one of their solution&#x27;s corollaries, which she once stated that

there is a constant &quot;N&quot; such that, given a Diophantine equation with any number of parameters and in any number of unknowns, one can effectively transform this equation into another with the same parameters but in only &quot;N&quot; unknowns such that both equations are solvable or unsolvable for the same values of the parameters.

At the time the solution was first published, the authors established &quot;N&quot; = 200. Robinson and Matiyasevich&#x27;s joint work would produce further reduction to 9 unknowns.

===Game theory ===
During the late 1940s, Robinson spent a year or so at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica researching game theory. Her 1949 technical report, &quot;On the Hamiltonian game (a traveling salesman problem),&quot; is the first publication to use the phrase &quot;travelling salesman problem&quot;. Shortly thereafter she published a paper called &quot;An Iterative Method of Solving a Game&quot; in 1951. In her paper, she proved that the fictitious play dynamics converges to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. This was posed by George W. Brown as a prize problem at RAND Corporation.

==Professorship at UC Berkeley==
Robinson was not allowed to teach in the Mathematics Department at Berkeley after marrying Raphael M. Robinson in 1941, as there was a rule that prevented family members from working together in the same department. Robinson then instead stayed in the statistics department despite wanting to teach calculus. 
Although Raphael retired in 1973, it was not until 1976 she was offered a full-time professorship position at Berkeley after the department heard of her nomination to the National Academy of Sciences.

==Honors==
After Yuri Matiyasevich solved Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem by means of the J.R. hypothesis and the Fibonacci number sequence, Saunders Mac Lane nominated Robinson for the National Academy of Sciences. Alfred Tarski and Jerzy Neyman also flew out to Washington, D.C. to further explain to the National Academy of Sciences why her work is so important and how it tremendously contributed to mathematics. In 1975, she was the first female mathematician to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

Robinson was chosen as the first female president of the American Mathematical Society (for the term of 1983–1984) but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia. It took time for her to accept the nomination, as stated in her autobiography:&quot;In 1982 I was nominated for the presidency of the American Mathematical Society. I realized that I had been chosen because I was a woman and because I had the seal of approval, as it were, of the National Academy. After discussion with Raphael, who thought I should decline and save my energy for mathematics, and other members of my family, who differed with him, I decided that as a woman and a mathematician I had no alternative but to accept. I have always tried to do everything I could to encourage talented women to become research mathematicians. I found my service as president of the Society taxing but very, very satisfying.&quot;

In 1982, Robinson gave the Noether Lecture of the Association for Women in Mathematics; her lecture was called &quot;Functional Equations in Arithmetic.&quot; Around this time she also was given the MacArthur Fellowship prize of $60,000. In 1985, she also became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Political work==
In the 1950s Robinson was active in local Democratic party activities. She was Alan Cranston&#x27;s campaign manager in Contra Costa County when he ran for his first political office, state controller.
Robinson was also a volunteer for Adlai Stevenson’s presidential campaigns.

== Death and legacy ==
In 1984, Robinson was diagnosed with leukemia, and she died in Oakland, California, on July 30, 1985.
One of her sisters, Constance Reid, won the Mathematical Association of America&#x27;s George Pólya Award in 1987 for writing the article &quot;The Autobiography of Julia Robinson&quot;.

The Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival, sponsored by the American Institute of Mathematics from 2013 to the present and by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute from 2007 to 2013, was named in her honor.

George Csicsery produced and directed a one-hour documentary about Robinson titled &quot;Julia Robinson and Hilbert&#x27;s Tenth Problem&quot;, that premiered at the Joint Mathematics Meeting in San Diego on January 7, 2008. &quot;Notices of the American Mathematical Society&quot; printed a film review and an interview with the director. The &quot;College Mathematics Journal&quot; also published a film review.

It was developed by the German composer Carl Orff (1895–1982) and colleague Gunild Keetman during the 1920s. Orff worked until the end of his life to continue the development and spread of his teaching method.

The Orff Approach is now used throughout the world to teach students in a natural and comfortable environment. The term &quot;Schulwerk&quot; is German for (literally) &quot;school work&quot; or &quot;schooling&quot;, in this regard in the area of music.

== Foundations ==
The Orff Approach of music education uses very rudimentary forms of everyday activity for the purpose of music creation by music students. The Orff Approach is a &quot;child-centered way of learning&quot; music education that treats music as a basic system like language and believes that just as every child can learn language without formal instruction so can every child learn music by a gentle and friendly approach.

It is often called &quot;Elemental Music making&quot; because the materials needed to teach students are &quot;basic, natural, and close to a child’s world of thought and fantasy&quot;.

In order for the Orff Approach to work effectively, teachers must create an atmosphere that is similar to a child&#x27;s world of play. This allows participating children to feel comfortable learning a new and often abstract musical skill, greater exploration of a musical instrument or musical skill, and keeps a student from feeling evaluated or judged by his or her peers and teachers. A child participating in an Orff classroom does not feel the pressure of performing that is often in tandem with music because every student in an Orff classroom is treated as an equal, even when performing a solo.

The Orff Approach is used by teachers to encourage their students to enjoy making music as individuals as well as in groups. Children realize the joys of group co-ordination and cohesion. It also involves the participation of other adults and parents in music making. Thus it brings the role of parent in child education in a central position. From a teacher&#x27;s aspect Orff-Schulwerk is also a process of breaking down each activity into its simplest form and then presenting those steps one at a time to eventually become a completed performance.

In the Orff Approach &quot;all concepts are learned by &#x27;doing. Students of the Orff Approach learn music by experiencing and participating in the different musical lessons and activities. These lessons stimulate not only the paraxial concepts of music like rhythm and tempo, but also the aesthetic qualities of music. &quot;Orff activities awaken the child’s total awareness&quot; and &quot;sensitize the child’s awareness of space, time, form, line, color, design, and mood- aesthetic data that musicians are acutely aware of, yet find hard to explain to musical novices&quot;.

Unlike Simply Music or the Suzuki Method, the Orff Schulwerk approach is not a method. There is no systematic stepwise procedure to be followed. There are fundamental principles, clear models and basic processes that all intuitive and creative teachers use to guide their organization of musical ideas.

==Music==

The music generated in the Orff Approach is largely improvisational and uses original tonal constructions that build a sense of confidence and interest in the process of creative thinking. Students of the Orff Approach sing, play instruments, and dance alone as well as in groups. Songs are usually short, contain ostinatos, are within singing range, can be manipulated to be played in a round or ABA form. &quot;Music is chosen with strong nationalistic flavor, being related to folk songs and music of the child’s own heritage&quot;. Music can also be anything from nursery rhymes to songs that are invented by the children themselves. Orff-Schulwerk music is largely based on simple but forceful variations on rhythmic patterns. This makes for very simple and beautiful musical forms, which are easily learned by young children, and is also useful for adults and thus it has a universal appeal. Composer Dave Hewson was exposed to Orff Schulwerk and this influence helped to shape a lot of his later music.

The music is largely modal, beginning with pentatonic (both major and minor) scales. (English version adapted by Margaret Murray) The drone or bordun, is quickly established as the ground bass that supports most melodies and melodic ostinatos add energy and colour.

Volume II in Part One, covers hexachordal (added &quot;fa&quot;) melodies over Major Drone Bass Triads, and then seven notes: Ionian mode. Note, this is not major scale, as the drone bass enforces a non-functional harmony. Parallel thirds and sixths (paraphony) are used liberally here. Part Two introduces the use of triads as following: I – ii, and some I – vi.

Goodkin (p172) discusses the progression of the volumes: I-II-III-IV-V as opposed to I-II-IV-III-V. Volume III introduces Major Dominant and Subdominant triads (That is to say: functional harmony). However Volume IV can be viewed as more logically the next step as it introduces Dorian, Aeolian and Phrygian modes with similar shifting drones and triads to those found previously in Vol II.

Vol IV, Part One: Minor-Drone Bass Triads. Aeolian, Dorian and Phrygian mode, i-ii shifting drones and triads. Part Two: Tonic and Leading Note triads, i-IV and decoration of the third.

Vol III Major Dominant and Subdominant Triads. This harmonic world is more challenging for children and improvising than the modes, hence the importance of leaving until skills have developed appropriately.

Volume V follows III, but explores Minor Dominant and Subdominant Chords.

And finally, almost as an afterthought, Paralipomena which explores the worlds of Lydian I-II, and Mixolydian I-VII.

When interesting original music has been generated by the groups or individual child a desire to record it may arise. Thus, the desire to develop musical skills emerges by itself and the child may be intrinsically propelled to learn formal music.

== Orff&#x27;s Instruments and tools ==

Orff considered the percussive rhythm as a natural basic form of human expression. Orff and colleague Gunild Keetman co-composed much of the music for the five volume series, &quot;Music for Children.&quot; These volumes, first published in 1950, are still available and used today. Music played on Orff instruments is often very simple and easy to play even for first time musicians.

Some of the instruments within the approach include miniature xylophones, marimbas, glockenspiels and metallophones; all of which have removable bars, resonating columns to project the sound, and are easily transported and stored. Orff teachers also use different sized drums, recorders and non-pitched percussion instruments &quot;to round out the songs that are sung and played&quot;. The Orff approach also requires that children sing, chant, clap, dance, pat and snap fingers along to melodies and rhythms.

==Spread==
In 1923 Orff met while working at a theater in Munich. Günther &quot;believed that most students did not get enough chances to do art and music and movement activities&quot;. Because of his extensive background in gymnastics and the arts Günther was able to open the Günther-Schule in 1924. Even though Orff never worked with the students of the Günther-Schule directly, this was the first institution to teach what would later be known as the Orff Approach.

Students of the Günther-Schule later went on to be dancers and teachers of note. One of these students, Keetman, began as a student and became a teacher at the school. The Günther-Schule originally only taught older students; however, Keetman later worked on developing the ideas of the school to teach younger children as well. Together she and Orff created the five volume series &quot;Music for Children&quot; which is still used by teachers today. In 1936, Günther, Keetman and Orff contributed to the opening ceremony of the 1936 Summer Olympics. The Günther-Schule was closed in 1944 due to the war. In 1945 the building was destroyed in an Allied bombing raid and all materials (instruments, costumes, photographs, and its library and archives) were destroyed.

After the war, two serendipitous events brought Orff&#x27;s approach back into the educational field. A series of radio programs aimed at children was broadcast in Bavaria. Orff wrote the music and re-united with Keetman to work on these broadcasts. The second event was the Mozartariums&#x27; request to have Keetman teach classes to children between 8 and 10 years old. Traude Schrattenecker who was also a graduate of the Günther-Schule, joined Keetman in running this school.

There are Orff Schulwerk associations in different countries across the world including Germany, Canada, the United States, Australia, Korea, the United Kingdom, South Africa, France, Finland and New Zealand. All of these organisations promote the teachings of Orff and Keetman and the spread of the Approach. Through all of these organizations teachers interested in teaching the Orff Approach can become certified in the Approach.

==The American model ==
The American Orff-Schulwerk Association offers three different levels of training, each of which takes 60 hours to complete. Level one focuses on the &quot;necessary skills to plan and implement a variety of Orff Schulwerk music and movement activities in the classroom.&quot; &quot;Levels two and three are concerned with development of conceptual understanding of music and movement elements as they are presented in the Schulwerk elemental music context, as well as the skill needed to implement them&quot;.

In America there are four stages in the Orff Approach: imitation, exploration, improvisation, and composition. Through imitation, the teacher, group leader, or even the students perform for the class and the class in turn repeats what was played for them. Exploration allows students to seek out the musical aspects that the Orff instruments offer and explore aural/oral skills and the motions and expressions that the body is capable of. Literacy is taught by learning musical notation and becoming familiar with forms of music like rondo and ABA. Improvisation is the act of creating something, especially music, without prior preparation. To improvise, a student must have &quot;a preliminary knowledge and comprehension of concepts.&quot; Students of the Orff Approach learn to create their own melodies in a comfortable environment that allows for mistakes and promotes creativity.

==Orff Schulwerk in Aotearoa/New Zealand==
Orff New Zealand Aotearoa (ONZA) is a professional society dedicated to the promotion of the Orff Schulwerk approach in New Zealand. The organisation is a member of the Orff Schulwerk Forum Salzburg. In association with the University of Waikato, ONZA offers a four-tiered course of study in the Orff approach, which includes practical workshops and critical investigation.

==Other applications==
The Orff Approach was originally intended to teach music to children but because of the different benefits that it offers with coordination, dexterity, and concentration the technique is often used to teach individuals with special needs. The simplicity of the technique allows all ranges of handicapped students to participate in the learning process. Mentally handicapped students can easily perform the tasks without fear of being ridiculed or being left behind. The visually impaired who tend to have &quot;hesitant, jerky, and over controlled&quot; movements because they &quot;often breathe quite shallowly&quot; can use the different breathing and movement exercises to relax their body and breathing. Students with a hearing impairment can use the Orff Approach by feeling the vibrations that are created by different musical instrument. Since music is mostly resilient, students who have had injuries that have mentally impaired them can use the Approach as a form of therapy. Even elderly individuals who often become weak with old age can use the Orff Approach to help with memory, dexterity, and agility.

<text>Walter Burgwyn Jones (October 16, 1888 – August 1, 1963) was an American judge, legislator, and writer from Alabama.

==Political career==
Jones served in the Alabama House of Representatives, as a Democrat, from 1919 to 1920. He was then a circuit court judge until 1935. Jones was a presiding judge from 1935 to 1963.

In 1956, Jones granted an injunction against the operation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People within the state of Alabama. The injunction had been prepared secretly by state Attorney General John Malcolm Patterson and was granted by Jones &quot;in a stunning abuse of judicial power ... without so much as a public hearing.&quot; The injunction also demanded the NAACP hand over the names and addresses of every Alabama member of the organization.

While presiding over &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; in 1960, Jones ruled that the presence of an Alabama lawyer representing &quot;The New York Times&quot; contributed to the existence of a substantial business interest in the state of Alabama. This ruling ensured that the lawsuit would play out in his own courtroom. In so doing, he overruled his own book, &quot;Alabama Pleading and Practice.&quot; Jones was an avowed white-supremacist. While presiding in Sullivan, Jones began by lecturing against &quot;racial agitators&quot; and in praise of &quot;white man&#x27;s justice.&quot;

==Personal life==
Walter Burgwyn Jones was also a writer. His father was Thomas G. Jones, the Governor of Alabama. Jones was born in Montgomery, Alabama; he went to Alabama Polytechnic Institute in 1906 and 1907. Jones then received his law degree in 1909 from the University of Alabama School of Law.

==United States presidential election of 1956==
In the 1956 Presidential election, faithless elector W. F. Turner cast his vote for Jones, who was a circuit court judge in Turner&#x27;s home town, for President of the United States and Herman E. Talmadge for Vice President, instead of voting for Adlai Stevenson and Estes Kefauver.

<doc id="952999" wikidata="Q16993565" url="?curid=952999" title="Afro-Peruvian music">
<text>Afro-Peruvian music, Black Peruvian Music, Música afroperuana, or Música negra, is a type of Latin American music first developed in Peru by enslaved black people from West Africa, where it is known as &quot;Festejo&quot;. The genre is a mix of West African and Spanish music.

==About==
Música Criolla includes flamenco-influenced guitar sounds, as well as percussion instruments, including cajon, cajita, cowbell and quijada.

==History==
Much of the original music has been lost, but in the 1950s a revival was staged by José Durand, a white Peruvian criollo who was a folklore professor, and Porfirio Vásquez. Durand founded the Pancho Fierro Dance Company. Drawing upon elderly members of the community for memories of musical traditions, Durand collaborated with Vásquez to revive various songs and dances to create the repertoire for the group. One of the best known is his revival of the carnival dance “El Son de los Diablos.” In colonial times, this dance was featured in parades with a fleet of austere, pure angels leading the way, followed by the mischievous devils. In the revival of the dance, the angels were eliminated, and the crowds were entertained by rambunctious devils and their leader “el diablo mayor.” The dance featured energetic zapateo tap-dancing. The group performed for about two years, including a concert for Peruvian composer Chabuca Granda and a tour through Chile.

Actually, poet Nicomendes Santa Cruz and Victoria Santa Cruz (siblings) both created Cumanana (1957) an Afroperuvian ensemble that highlighted the rich West and Central African call and response poetry, music / dance traditions that were a staple of Peruvian culture and are essentially valued to this day.

One long lasting Afro-Peruvian dance company was Perú Negro, which, incorporated more modern use of percussion combined with criollo music. Perú Negro is also known for their use of blackface, celebrating the mixture of African and Spanish heritage. Two of their best known pieces are “Dance of the Laundresses,” which depicts historical hard working yet beautiful black women in Peru, and the “Canto a Elegua,” which shows tribal religion before the Spanish influence.

Lima, Cañete and Chincha are areas where there are many performers of this music, which is played in night clubs, dinner dances and festivals. Notable artists and groups through the years have included Victoria and Nicomedes Santa Cruz, Ronaldo Campos, Caitro Soto, Lucila Campos, Pepe Vásquez, and Susana Baca. One of the best known songs in the genre is Peru&#x27;s &quot;Toro Mata&quot;.

However, regardless of the reconstructed dances, there are manifestations that did last in time, such as the &quot;Dance of Negritos and Pallitas&quot; practiced at Christmas parties in the towns of the central-south coast of Peru.

<text>Softlanding Linux System (SLS) was one of the first Linux distributions. The first release was by Peter MacDonald in May 1992. Their slogan at the time was &quot;Gentle Touchdowns for DOS Bailouts&quot;. SLS was the first release to offer a comprehensive Linux distribution containing more than the Linux kernel, GNU, and other basic utilities, including an implementation of the X Window System.

==History==
SLS was the most popular Linux distribution at the time, but it was considered to be rather buggy by its users. It was soon superseded by Slackware (which started as a cleanup of SLS by Patrick Volkerding) and Yggdrasil Linux/GNU/X, among others.

Similarly, Ian Murdock&#x27;s frustration with SLS led him to create the Debian project.

<text>Geoffrey M. Sanderson (born February 1, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger, most notably for the Hartford Whalers and Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL).

==Playing career==
Drafted by the Hartford Whalers 36th overall in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Sanderson made his NHL debut at the tail end of the 1990–91 season with the Whalers. He was on the roster for their first round playoff loss, and was then sent to bolster their American Hockey League affiliate, the Springfield Indians, who went on to win the Calder Cup. Sanderson played in 64 games in his first full season for the club in 1991–92. In the first round of that year&#x27;s playoffs, Hartford was trailing the Montreal Canadiens 2–1 late in the second period of Game 7, when Sanderson scored his first career playoff goal to tie the game. The Canadiens eventually won in double overtime. Over his next five years in Hartford, Sanderson scored more than 30 goals every season with the exception of the 1994–95 lockout season, but the Whalers missed the playoffs each year.

Sanderson remained with the franchise as they moved from Hartford and become the Carolina Hurricanes, but halfway through the 1997-98 NHL season he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks, and shortly thereafter to the Buffalo Sabres in a separate trade. In Buffalo he did not receive the same level of ice time he had in Hartford, but he experienced the most playoff time of his career. In the first round the Sabres defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 4–1, to set up a quarterfinal matchup with the Canadiens. In game 1 Sanderson scored twice, including the game-winning overtime goal, in front of the home crowd to give the Sabres a 1–0 series lead. Buffalo also won game 2, and Sanderson scored a pivotal goal in game 3, which was won by the Sabres in double overtime. The Sabres completed the sweep, but then lost to the Washington Capitals 4 games to 2 in the Eastern Conference Finals.

During the 1998-99 NHL season the Sabres continued their winning ways and Sanderson continued to put up respectable third line numbers. After the Sabres swept the Ottawa Senators in the first round of the playoffs, and then dispatched the Boston Bruins in six games, they once again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, this time against their cross-lake rivals, the Toronto Maple Leafs. In game 1 Sanderson scored his first goal of the playoffs, which turned out to be the game winner as the Sabres won 5–4. The Leafs won game 2, and the Sabres won game 3. In game 4 Buffalo started off strong building a 3–0 lead following second period goals by Brian Holzinger and Rob Ray. Just twenty-two seconds after Ray&#x27;s goal, Sanderson made it 4–0, and then made it 5–0 with another goal ten minutes later. The Sabres went on to win the series, and advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in team history. Facing the Dallas Stars, Buffalo took game 1 on the road in overtime, but Dallas fought back and won the next two games. In game 4 in Buffalo, Sanderson beat Ed Belfour to score the game&#x27;s first goal halfway through the first period, and Buffalo eventually won the game, sending the series back to Dallas tied 2–2. Dallas won game 5, and then won game 6 of the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals – and the Stanley Cup as a result – on a controversial Brett Hull triple overtime goal.

Sanderson was selected by the Columbus Blue Jackets in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft, and scored 30-plus goals in 2000–01 and 2002–03. He was the first Blue Jacket to score a hat trick. He returned to Vancouver at the trade deadline in 2003–04. With the Canucks Sanderson played his final postseason games in 2004, scoring a goal in Canucks&#x27; first round loss to the Calgary Flames.

He was reclaimed by Columbus off waivers in the off-season, and Sanderson was traded two games into the 2005–06 season to the Phoenix Coyotes. After scoring 25 goals in 75 games with Phoenix, Sanderson signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers in the off-season.

A disappointing year with Philadelphia resulted in Sanderson being traded to Edmonton with Joni Pitkanen in exchange for Joffrey Lupul and former Oilers captain Jason Smith. Sanderson scored two goals against Philadelphia the first time he played against his former team. Following the 2008 season, Edmonton declined to tender Sanderson a contract, ending his professional playing career.

Sanderson ended his NHL career with a total of exactly 700 points, making him the most successful hockey player to come out of the Northwest Territories.

==Retirement==
Sanderson accepted a developmental coaching and scouting role within the New York Islanders organization to begin the 2010–11 season. After his second season with the Islanders, Sanderson opted to step away from his position citing family reasons, and a similar lifestyle to his playing days. Sanderson formed and currently runs an oil and gas rental equipment company, Breakaway Matting, alongside former teammate Brendan Morrison.

==Personal life==
Sanderson is one of few NHL players to have been born in the Northwest Territories (Hay River) and spent his early years in Pine Point, Northwest Territories, while his father worked as a pharmacist in the now defunct town. Geoff then spent his junior high school years in High Level, Alberta. His dad, Aaron, owned the only pharmacy in High Level and would close the store every Saturday at 5:55 pm so he could be at home by 6 pm to watch Hockey Night in Canada with his boys. As a teenager, Geoff relocated with his family to St. Albert, Alberta, for Grades 10–12. Sanderson currently resides in Calgary, Alberta, with his wife Ellen and three sons. His son Jake Sanderson is a defenceman for the Ottawa Senators.

In 2013, Sanderson coached his oldest son&#x27;s peewee team, the Springbank Whalers of Calgary.

He has two cousins who have also played in the NHL: Wade Brookbank, who most recently played for the Rockford IceHogs, and Sheldon Brookbank, who was a former assistant coach for the Chicago Blackhawks.

<doc id="953021" wikidata="Q4943542" url="?curid=953021" title="Lotta Crabtree">
<text>Charlotte Mignon &quot;Lotta&quot; Crabtree (November 7, 1847 – September 25, 1924), also known mononymously as Lotta, was an American actress, entertainer, comedian, and philanthropist. Born in New York City and raised in the gold mining hills of Northern California, she rose to fame as a child performer. Crabtree became one of the wealthiest and most beloved American entertainers of the late 19th century. From her beginnings as a 6-year-old until her retirement at age 45, she entertained and was named &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Darling&quot;. Her life story was filmed as &quot;Golden Girl&quot; (1951), starring Mitzi Gaynor.

==Early life==
Charlotte Mignon Crabtree was born in New York City on November 7, 1847. Her father, John Ashworth Crabtree, a book seller, left for San Francisco in 1851 to join those seeking fortune in the California Gold Rush. Crabtree and her mother, Mary Ann (née Livesey) Crabtree, followed two years later, joining John in the boomtown of Grass Valley. While in Grass Valley, the Crabtrees ran a boarding house. Lotta soon attracted the attention of a neighbor, the dancer and actress Lola Montez, who encouraged Lotta&#x27;s enthusiasm for performing.

The Crabtrees moved again and set up another boarding house, this time in Rabbit Creek, 40 miles north of Grass Valley. Soon after, Crabtree made her first professional appearance at a tavern in Rabbit Creek with support from the Robinson Family of performers. She began touring throughout the California mining camps making a name for herself as a dancer, singer, and banjo player.

In 1856, the family moved back to San Francisco. Rowena Granice Steele had established The Gaieties, Temple of Mirth and Song theater and saloon in that year, and Crabtree, her protege, was one of the early performers at that venue. By 1859, she had become &quot;Miss Lotta, the San Francisco Favorite&quot;. Crabtree&#x27;s mother served as her manager and collected all of Lotta&#x27;s earnings in gold, carrying it in a large leather bag. When this became too heavy, it was transferred to a steamer trunk. 

With the silver discovery in Nevada beginning in 1859, Crabtree became a recurring star after first appearing there in 1863. The embodiment of fun and frolic, Crabtree mugged for the audience, twisted her finger in her dimple, stuffed coins thrown on stage to her into the tops of her stockings, and overall personified the happy scamp. She had two brothers that were born a few years apart.

==Later career==

Having made a name for herself in California, in 1864 Crabtree left to tour the East Coast, where she began acting in plays, in theaters, such as &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; and &quot;Little Nell and the Marchioness&quot;. 

With her petite stature, she became a favorite for her portrayals of children. The late 1860s would see the &quot;Lotta Polka&quot; and &quot;Lotta Gallup&quot; as quite the rage in America. At age 20, she was a national star. By 1875, she was touring the nation with her own theatrical company. She achieved the height of her success in the 1870s and 1880s. She starred in several successful plays written for by Fred Marsden, including &quot;Zip&quot; (1874) and Musette&quot; (1876). 

The 1880s saw her perennially as the highest-paid actress in America, earning sums of up to $5,000 per week. Her mother Mary Ann was still managing Crabtree&#x27;s affairs: booking plays, finding locations, and organizing troupes of actors. When the steamer trunk became too heavy, she invested Crabtree&#x27;s earnings in local real estate, race horses and bonds. As well as investing, some of the money was used to support local charities (the Massachusetts Society for Aiding Discharged Prisoners – est. 1846 – still receives annual grants) and build fountains. Lotta&#x27;s Fountain, the most famous of these fountains, still stands at the intersection of Market and Kearny streets in San Francisco, and is the site of meetings every April 18, marking the anniversary of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Crabtree traveled abroad with her mother and brothers. She learned French, visited museums and began painting. After her tour abroad, Crabtree returned to San Francisco where she played at the California Theatre, reprising her role in &quot;Little Nell and the Marchioness&quot; by John Bowen. Having missed her while she was away, the city responded warmly to her return and treated her like their very own star.

In 1885, Crabtree&#x27;s mother had an 18-room summer cottage built in the Breslin Park section of Mount Arlington, New Jersey, on the shores of Lake Hopatcong. Named Attol Tryst (Lotta spelled backward), the house was designed by noted architect Frank Furness. Crabtree gave parties, rode horses, and pursued her painting. It stands today and in recent years has been restored.

==Retirement==
Crabtree was forced to retire as a result of a fall onstage in Wilmington, Delaware, in May 1889. After recovering in Lake Hopatcong, she attempted a comeback in 1891, but a lack of public enthusiasm persuaded her to retire permanently from the stage. She later resisted calls for a farewell tour. At age 45, she was the richest actress in America, the theater was changing and she got out at the top. She made one final appearance in 1915 for Lotta Crabtree Day in San Francisco at the Panama-Pacific Exposition.

While Crabtree apparently had her share of romance, her travel, lifestyle, and mother made a long-term relationship difficult, and she never married. Following retirement, Crabtree traveled, painted (including studying at Paris in 1912) and was active in charitable work. Late in her life, Crabtree moved to Massachusetts and was owner of acreage in the southern part of the Squantum section of Quincy, immediately south of Boston, Massachusetts. It is said to have been purchased for the benefit and health of her brother (Ashworth) and for their horses. Much of the land was sold as house lots in the 1930s/40s. Children who walked to school through her land in those days often passed by two small markers of local granite set into the ground, engraved &quot;Ruby Royal&quot; and &quot;Sonoma Girl&quot; – two of the Crabtrees&#x27; horses. The stone for Ruby still exists on Livesey Road. Local street names include Ashworth Road, Livesey Road, Sonoma Road, and the shoreline Crabtree Road. Ashworth was a family surname, as was Livesey. Further information may be available through the Quincy, Massachusetts Historical Society.

 Crabtree spent the last 15 years of her life at the Brewster Hotel in Boston, which she had purchased in 1909. She died there on September 25, 1924, at age 76 from undisclosed causes. In her obituary, the &quot;New York Times&quot; called her the &quot;eternal child&quot;. She was described by critics as mischievous, unpredictable, impulsive, rattlebrained, teasing, piquant, rollicking, cheerful, and devilish. She was interred at the Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York. She left an estate of some $4 million in a charitable trust for such causes as veterans, aging actors and animals. The estate ran into complications when a number of people unsuccessfully contested the will. The trust still exists today.

<text>Oliver Loving (December 4, 1812 – September 25, 1867) was an American rancher and cattle driver. Together with Charles Goodnight, he developed the Goodnight-Loving Trail. He was mortally wounded by Native Americans while on a cattle drive.

Loving County, Texas, the least-populous county in the United States is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Oliver Loving was born on December 4, 1812, in Hopkins County, Kentucky. His father was Joseph Loving and his mother, Susannah Mary Bourland.

==Career==
In 1833, he became a farmer in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky. Ten years later, with his brother and his brother-in-law, he moved to the Republic of Texas with their families. In Texas, Loving received 639.3 acres (2.59 km2) of land in three patents spread through three counties Collin, Dallas, and Parker. He farmed and, to feed his growing family, hauled freight in his early years as a Texan.

By 1855, he moved with his family to the future Palo Pinto County, Texas, where he ran a country store and ranched on Keechi Creek. By 1857, he owned a thousand acres (4 km2) of land. To market his large herd, Loving drove them out of Texas and in that same year he entrusted his nineteen-year-old son, Joseph, to drive his and his neighbors&#x27; cattle to Illinois up the Shawnee Trail. The drive made a profit of $36 head and encouraged Loving to repeat the trek successfully the next year with John Noble Durkee.

On August 29, 1860, together with John Dawson, he started a herd of 1,500 toward Denver, Colorado to feed miners in the area. They crossed the Red River, traveled to the Arkansas River, and followed it to Pueblo, Colorado, where the cattle wintered. In the spring, Loving sold his cattle for gold and tried to leave for Texas. However, the American Civil War had broken out and the Union authorities prevented him from returning to the South until Kit Carson and others interceded for him. During the war, he was commissioned to provide beef to the Confederate States Army and drive cattle along the Mississippi River. When the war ended, the Confederate government reportedly owed him between $100,000 and $250,000. To make matters worse, the usual cattle markets were inadequate for the available supply.

In 1866, having heard about the probable need for cattle at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, where some eight thousand Native American Indians had been settled on a reservation, he gathered a herd, combined it with that of Charles Goodnight, and began a long drive to the fort. Their route later became known as the Goodnight-Loving Trail. The two cattlemen sold beef to the army for $12,000 in gold, and then Loving drove the stock cattle on to Colorado and sold them near Denver, while Goodnight returned to Weatherford, the seat of Parker County, Texas, with the gold and also for a second herd. The two men were reunited in southern New Mexico, where they went into partnership with John Chisum at his ranch in the Bosque Grande, about forty miles south of Fort Sumner. (Chisum&#x27;s sister Nancy was married to Loving&#x27;s cousin, B.F. Bourland and had known Chisum for many years.) They spent the winter of 1866-67 there and supplied cattle from the ranch to Fort Sumner and Santa Fe.

==Personal life==
He married Susan Doggett Morgan in 1833. They had nine children.

==Death==
In the spring of 1867, Loving and Goodnight returned to Texas, ready to start a new drive. This third drive was slowed by heavy rains and Native American threats. Loving went ahead of the herd for contract bidding, taking only Bill Wilson, a trusted scout, with him. Although Wilson told Loving that he should travel at night through Native American Indian country, Loving pushed ahead during the day. In a Comanche attack, he was seriously wounded at Loving Bend on the Pecos River. The weakened Loving sent Wilson back to the herd, eluded the Indians, and, with the aid of Mexican traders, reached Fort Sumner, only to die there of gangrene. Before he died on September 25, 1867, Goodnight assured him that his wish to be buried in Texas would be carried out. After a temporary burial at Fort Sumner, while Goodnight drove the herd on to Colorado, Goodnight had Loving&#x27;s body exhumed and returned to Texas. Stories differ as to who accompanied the body back to Weatherford, but he was reburied there in Greenwood Cemetery on March 4, 1868. As a member of Phoenix Lodge No. 275 at Weatherford, Loving was buried with Masonic honors.

==Legacy==
Loving County, Texas is named in his honor, as is the town of Loving, New Mexico. Additionally, Loving Bend on the Pecos River is also named for him. He has been inducted into the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Also, his death was borrowed by novelist Larry McMurtry for his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;. In the book, Augustus &quot;Gus&quot; McCrae is injured by Indian arrows and sends his companion Pea Eye Parker to retrieve Woodrow F. Call. McCrae makes it to Miles City, but dies of blood poisoning, despite having one of his legs amputated. Call, like Goodnight, brings him back to Texas to bury him. In 1958, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

<doc id="953028" wikidata="Q5222289" url="?curid=953028" title="Darby Steam-Digger">
<text>The Darby Steam-Digger, a light traction engine, was invented circa 1879 by farmer Thomas Darby and built at Lodge Farm Pleshey, near Chelmsford in Essex, England. Robert Hasler, seen driving the Digger, helped to build this first prototype. In 1900 the company moved to a 6 acre site known as Stileman&#x27;s Works in Wickford, Essex. In mid-1906 the works and its contents were auctioned under the order of the executors of the late T. Dowsett (who was the first mayor of Southend, and an extremely wealthy man). This sale included 6 traction engines and 21 Darby Land Diggers.

== First Version ==

In effect the machine was an early tractor designed mainly for ploughing, and could accomplish an hour (1 m2/s) to a maximum depth of 14 inches (360 mm). This first digger was constructed on pedestrian principles and had six &quot;feet&quot; and really did walk over the fields. Unfortunately it jumped too much to be really successful. The digger was later modified to have wheels in place of the legs. This machine pre-dated the Ivel tractor built by Dan Albone of Biggleswade in 1902 which he started designing in 1896. The Ivel tractor is generally considered to be the first British tractor with an internal combustion engine.

Robert Hasler was born in Pleshey in 1856; he worked as an engineer for Thomas Darby for 26 years, then became the village blacksmith (following his father) until he retired in 1925. At the age of 19 he was badly kicked by a horse, and this necessitated one of his legs being amputated.

== Second version ==
The second version was known as the Darby Broadside Digger which was a larger machine which had eight legs and wheels and a double boiler having a smoke-box and chimney at each end.
== Third version ==

The third version was more like a conventional traction engine with the Digger attached behind - it had spades that actually dug into the ground and turned the soil over.

This was built by Coopers of King&#x27;s Lynn. One is thought to survive but it is hidden away.
The factory is still known as &quot; The Digger.&quot;

<text>The RWD 6 was a Polish sports plane of 1932, constructed by the RWD team. It was a winner of the Challenge 1932 international tourist aircraft contest.

==Development==
The aircraft was designed specially for the purpose of competing in the international tourist aircraft contest Challenge, which RWD attended in 1930, without major success. It was constructed by the RWD team of Stanislaw Rogalski, Stanislaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in the workshops of Students&#x27; Mechanical Club of Warsaw University of Technology (their designs were named RWD after their initial letters). The new plane differed from previous RWD designs, having a cab with two seats next to each other, folding wings and good wing mechanization (slats and flaps).

Only three aircraft were built, the first one was flown on June 3, 1932, by its designer Jerzy Drzewiecki. The aircraft were given civilian registrations SP-AHL, SP-AHM and SP-AHN. During trials, SP-AHM crashed and Drzewiecki was hurt. After some modification of the tail, the two remaining RWD 6s were sent to the Challenge contest.

Challenge 1932, held between August 11–28, 1932, was eventually won by Franciszek Żwirko (pilot) and Stanisław Wigura (mechanic) in their RWD 6 SP-AHN, with a start number O6. The other RWD 6, flown by Tadeusz Karpiński, took ninth place out of 43 competitors (SP-AHL, nr. O4). During contest, the RWD 6 was given the highest scores for technical evaluation of all participating aircraft.

On September 11, 1932, the RWD 6 SP-AHN with Franciszek Żwirko and Stanisław Wigura aboard, crashed during a storm while flying to an air meeting in Czechoslovakia. Both died. The cause was found to be weak wing mountings, that caused wing warping at higher speeds. The last remaining RWD 6 (SP-AHL) was modified after this accident, receiving a strengthened wing with V-shaped struts and the new designation RWD 6bis. The RWD 6bis was completed and flown in September 1933. In 1935 it was broken up, and its fuselage was used to create the RWD 13 touring plane prototype. A direct development of the RWD 6 as a sport plane was a four-seater RWD 9, a winner of the Challenge 1934.

==Description==
Two-seater sports and touring strutted high-wing monoplane of a mixed construction. A metal frame fuselage covered with canvas, with the engine clad in aluminium sheets. Rectangular single-spar wing of wooden construction, canvas and plywood covered. Wings folded rearwards, and were equipped with automatic slats and flaps. Closed cabin with two seats side-by-side, with dual controls. The cabin had a pair of doors. 7-cylinder Armstrong Siddeley Genet Major radial engine of 104 kW (140 hp) (119 kW, 160 hp start power). Two-blade metal propeller. Conventional landing gear, with a rear skid. Fuel tanks in wings (140 L, 34 US gal). Take-off: 111 m (to altitude 8 m), landing: 106 m (from altitude 8 m – best results from the Challenge contest).

<text>Martin David Davis (March 8, 1928 – January 1, 2023) was an American mathematician and computer scientist who contributed to the fields of computability theory and mathematical logic. His work on Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem led to the MRDP theorem. He also advanced the Post–Turing model and co-developed the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which is foundational for Boolean satisfiability solvers.

Davis won the Leroy P. Steele Prize, the Chauvenet Prize (with Reuben Hersh), and the Lester R. Ford Award. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

== Early life and education ==
Davis&#x27;s parents were Jewish immigrants to the United States from Łódź, Poland, and married after they met again in New York City. Davis was born in New York City on March 8, 1928. He grew up in the Bronx, where his parents encouraged him to obtain a full education. He graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science in 1944 and went on to receive his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from City College in 1948 and his PhD from Princeton University in 1950. His doctoral dissertation, entitled &quot;On the Theory of Recursive Unsolvability&quot;, was supervised by American mathematician and computer scientist Alonzo Church.

== Academic career ==
During a research instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the early 1950s, he joined the &quot;Control Systems Lab&quot; and became one of the early programmers of the ORDVAC. He later worked at Bell Labs and the RAND Corporation before joining New York University. During his time at the NYU, he helped set up the university&#x27;s computer science department. He retired from NYU in 1996. He was later a member of visiting faculty at University of California, Berkeley.

=== Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem ===

Davis first worked on Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem during his PhD dissertation, working with Alonzo Church. The theorem, as posed by the German mathematician David Hilbert, asks a question: given a Diophantine equation, is there an algorithm that can decide if the equation is solvable? Davis&#x27;s dissertation put forward a conjecture that the problem was unsolvable. In the 1950s and 1960s, Davis, along with American mathematicians Hilary Putnam and Julia Robinson, made progress toward solving this conjecture. The proof of the conjecture was finally completed in 1970 with the work of Russian mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich. This resulted in the MRDP or the DPRM theorem, named for Davis, Putnam, Robinson, and Matiyasevich. Describing the problem, Davis had earlier mentioned that he found the problem &quot;irresistibly seductive&quot; when he was an undergraduate and later had progressively become his &quot;lifelong obsession&quot;.

=== Other contributions ===
Davis collaborated with Putnam, George Logemann, and Donald W. Loveland in 1961 to introduce the Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland (DPLL) algorithm, which was a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form, i.e., for solving the CNF-SAT problem. The algorithm was a refinement of the earlier Davis–Putnam algorithm, which was a resolution-based procedure developed by Davis and Putnam in 1960. The algorithm is foundational in the architecture of fast Boolean satisfiability solvers.

In addition to his work on computability theory, Davis also made significant contributions to the fields of computational complexity and mathematical logic. Davis was also known for his model of Post–Turing machines.

In 1974, Davis won the Lester R. Ford Award for his expository writing related to his work on Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem, and in 1975 he won the Leroy P. Steele Prize and the Chauvenet Prize (with Reuben Hersh). He became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982, and in 2013, he was selected as one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society.

Davis&#x27;s 1958 book &quot;Computability and Unsolvability&quot; is considered a classic in theoretical computer science, while his 2000 book &quot;The Universal Computer&quot; traces the evolution and history of computing starting including works of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Alan Turing. His book &quot;The Undecidable&quot;, the first edition of which was published in 1965, was a collection of unsolvable problems and computable functions.

== Personal life and death ==
Davis was married to Virginia Whiteford Palmer, a textile artist. The couple met during their time in the Urbana–Champaign area and subsequently married in 1951. They had two children. The couple lived in Berkeley, California, after his retirement.

Davis died on January 1, 2023, at age 94. His wife died the same day several hours later.

<doc id="953045" wikidata="Q482455" url="?curid=953045" title="An Innocent Man">
<text>An Innocent Man is the ninth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on August 8, 1983. The concept album is a tribute to the American popular music of Joel&#x27;s adolescent years with Joel paying homage to a number of different and popular American musical styles from the late 1950s and early 1960s, most notably doo-wop and soul music. The album cover artwork was taken on the front steps of 142 Mercer Street, just north of the intersection of Mercer and Prince Street in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

==Background==
In an interview about the making of the album, Joel talks about the fact that at the time that he was recording &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;, he was newly divorced from his first wife, Elizabeth Weber, and was single for the first time since achieving rock star status. He had the opportunity to date supermodels such as Elle Macpherson and Christie Brinkley, and because of these experiences, he said, &quot;I kind of felt like a teenager all over again.&quot; Joel started writing songs in the same styles as pop songs that he remembered from his teenage years, citing pop music from the late 1950s and early 1960s, including &quot;early R&amp;B songs and The Four Seasons, and the Motown music, soul music.&quot; According to Joel, the various songs were not meant to be autobiographical, and instead center around various made-up characters.

Joel explained, &quot;When you&#x27;re gonna write [songs for a new album], you write what you&#x27;re feeling. And I didn&#x27;t fight it. The material was coming so easily and so quickly, and I was having so much fun doing it. I was kind of reliving my youth. ... I think within 6 weeks I had written most of the material on the album.&quot; Joel also said that he was pleasantly surprised to have hit records in the 1980s with retro songs like the mostly a cappella doo wop song &quot;The Longest Time.&quot; The song &quot;Easy Money&quot;, which was made as a tribute to early R&amp;B, was initially written for the 1983 film of the same name starring Rodney Dangerfield and was the song that &quot;kicked off&quot; the creation of &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;, according to Joel. Dangerfield later made a cameo appearance at the end of the music video for the song &quot;Tell Her About It&quot;, as an exchange for Joel&#x27;s song in support of Dangerfield&#x27;s movie. The song &quot;Christie Lee&quot; describes a narrative about a saxophone player who has his heart broken by a woman he falls in love with, whom he later realizes is only interested in him for his saxophone skills.

==Chart performance==
The album featured three &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 hit singles: &quot;Tell Her About It&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; (No. 3) and &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; (No. 10). Four other singles were released from the album: &quot;The Longest Time&quot; (No. 14), &quot;Leave a Tender Moment Alone&quot; (No. 27), &quot;Keeping the Faith&quot; (No. 18) and &quot;This Night&quot; (US B-side of &quot;Leave a Tender Moment Alone&quot;). &quot;Tell Her About It&quot; and &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; garnered international success—&quot;Uptown Girl&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; remained on the US Pop album chart for 111 weeks, becoming Joel&#x27;s longest charting studio album behind &quot;The Stranger&quot;. For over a year, the album remained on the charts in the UK, Japan and Australia.

==Critical reception==
Like his three previous efforts, Joel&#x27;s &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; received a nomination for the 26th Grammy Award for Album of the Year, although the award went to Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. The album was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Uptown Girl,&quot; but again was beaten by &quot;Thriller&quot;.

==Track listing==
All songs by Billy Joel, except for the chorus for &quot;This Night,&quot; which is credited on the sleeve to Joel and L. v. Beethoven.

The track listing on the LP is slightly different from that on the cassette and original CD pressings, with the latter swapping the places of &quot;The Longest Time&quot; and &quot;Uptown Girl.&quot; However, on the actual cassette shell and disc label, the songs are listed (and play) in the correct order as printed on the LP.

<text>Digital Image Design (DID) was a British video game developer founded by Martin Kenwright and Phillip Allsopp in 1989. It was originally based in Runcorn, Cheshire in England. The company specialized in aircraft simulator games, mostly published by Ocean Software. DID expanded following the release of &quot;TFX&quot;, &quot;Inferno&quot;, and &quot;EF2000&quot;, and subsequently moved offices to Warrington. During this period, the technology from one of its products was spun off into a military laser designation simulator and they would also produce professional flight simulators for customers such as the Royal Air Force and British Airways.

After being taken over by Infogrames, key members of staff including Kenwright and Mick Hocking left to form Evolution Studios together with Ian Hetherington from Psygnosis. The company was subsequently sold to Rage Games Limited. After the demise of Rage Games Limited, a company named Juice Games appeared in the same Warrington office, with some key members of staff. Juice Games later became THQ Digital Studios UK.

<text>Storm Front is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on October 23, 1989. It was Joel&#x27;s third album to reach No. 1 in the U.S. and features &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;, a fast-paced song that cataloged a list of historical events, trends, and cultural icons from 1949 (when Joel was born) until 1989.

&quot;I Go to Extremes&quot;, a song describing the ups and downs of his emotional life, placed at No. 6. Other songs that placed in the top 100 were &quot;And So It Goes&quot; (No. 37), &quot;The Downeaster &#x27;Alexa&#x27;&quot; (No. 57), and &quot;That&#x27;s Not Her Style&quot; (No. 77). The album was also nominated for five Grammy Awards. The album&#x27;s cover depicts the maritime storm warning flag indicating wind forces 10–12, the highest intensity on the Beaufort scale. Joel has stated in recent Sirius XM segments that he was inspired by Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1986 track &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; for the &quot;driving rhythm section&quot; when he was writing the title track.

== Notable cover versions ==
*In 1991, Garth Brooks recorded &quot;Shameless&quot; on his album &quot;Ropin&#x27; the Wind&quot;. Brooks&#x27; cover version was also released as a single and reached the top of the US country charts, and also entered the UK Singles Chart.

<text>Thales Australia (formerly Australian Defence Industries and ADI Limited) is a defence contractor based in Australia. It is a subsidiary of the French defence technology conglomerate Thales Group.

Thales Australia had been engaged in numerous programmes in conjunction with the Australian Defence Force, as well as overseas operators. It specialises in the design and delivery of various systems, products and services for both commercial and defence sectors.

==Services==
The company can trace its roots back to the 1890s. It gradually developed its industrial base and grew to become a major indigenous defence specialist, handling the design, manufacture, and through-life support of various defence systems. Accordingly, the firm, previously known as Australian Defence Industries (ADI) has operated numerous long-term contracts with the Australian government and the Australian Defence Forces alike.

For many years, ADI was the sole indigenous defence contractor in Australia; however, a rival in the form of Tenix Defence was created as a subsidiary of Tenix Group company in 1997. While at one point Tenix Defence had displaced ADI as the biggest military contractor in the nation, British defence firm BAE Systems completed the acquisition of Tenix Defence during June 2008 in exchange for A$775 million (£373 million).

As ADI, the company manufactured various small arms, including the Steyr AUG-based EF88 Austeyr assault rifle at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, along with a variety of smokeless powders for reloading rifle, pistol &amp; shotgun cartridges. ADI was also a major producer of Australian armoured vehicles, such as the Bushmaster and Hawkei; it developed region-specific modifications for imported military vehicles as well. The production of the Bushmaster reportedly comprised over a quarter of the firm&#x27;s export sales during 2009.

Throughout much of the company&#x27;s existence, ADI was based on Garden Island Naval Base in Sydney, it also maintained a R&amp;D/Custom production facility in Brisbane. During 2004, ADI controversially applied to the Australian Equal Opportunities Commission to exclude workers of certain nationalities for security reasons.

During October 2006, it was announced that the Australian federal government had permitted the regional conglomerate Transfield Holdings to sell their 50% shareholding in ADI to the Thales Group&#x27;s Australian holdings, the Australian branch of the French military engineering firm. Accordingly, all ADI operations have been acquired by the company, which is now known as Thales Australia.

Thales Australia is perhaps best known for its naval ship repair operations and, , leases the Captain Cook Graving Dock at Garden Island Naval Base in Sydney and also leases and occupies many of the buildings there. ADI&#x27;s large site in St Marys in Western Sydney is progressively being repatriated for residential development with their munitions capability being consolidated in Benalla, Victoria and their testing facilities being sold to Vipac Engineers and Scientists. In addition to the supply of complete warships, Thales Australia handles the integration of various elements of naval equipment, including radar, sonar, communications, optronics and electronic warfare systems, in addition to miscellaneous support services.

By 2010, Thales Australia reportedly employed 3,300 people spread across 35 sites, the majority of which were based in New South Wales and Victoria. At the same time, roughly 65 per cent of the firm&#x27;s activity was within the defence sector, with transport, security, and aerospace comprising the remainder. By 2020, the company had opened two additional sites and had 3,900 employees throughout Australia.

Thales Australia has been involved in various aerospace programmes, having specialised in avionics and aerospace-grade electronics. By 2010, the firm was engaged in the Eurocopter Tiger and NHIndustries NH90 helicopter programmes, serving as the major maintenance, spares and systems supplier on behalf of the Australian Defence Force. It has also been a supplier of various avionics and subsystems, including digital mapping, navigation, communications, electronic warfare systems, mission computers, flight simulators, sonar and mine detection apparatus. The company has developed a range of solutions for the air traffic control function.

By the 2010s, one growing sector of the firm has been its services division. Thales Australia has delivered various programmes related to mass transportation and public infrastructure, including the Auckland Public Transport Ticketing system, designing and implementing open road tolling infrastructure, and gas turbine containerisation. Transport-specific services include command and control systems, railway signalling, security, and communications solutions. Thales Australia also offers numerous security-related services, including secure communications, infrastructure security, border protection technologies, ID management, and cryptology.

On 29 June 2020, Thales Australia agreed to enter into a joint tenancy, alongside NIOA, of the government-owned munitions factory in Benalla, in addition to continuing its sole tenancy of the government-owned propellant factory in Mulwala.

<doc id="953058" wikidata="Q1487364" url="?curid=953058" title="River of Dreams">
<text>River of Dreams is the twelfth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released on August 10, 1993. &quot;River of Dreams&quot; presented a more serious tone than found in Joel&#x27;s previous albums, dealing with issues such as trust and long-lasting love. It was rumored that the themes of trust and betrayal, particularly certain lyrics from the songs &quot;A Minor Variation&quot; and &quot;The Great Wall of China&quot;, stem from Joel&#x27;s legal disputes with his former manager and ex-brother-in-law, Frank Weber, who reportedly embezzled millions of dollars from Joel and used dubious accounting practices to cover it up. It was Joel&#x27;s fourth and last album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart, a position it held for three consecutive weeks.

&quot;River of Dreams&quot; is the last rock album Joel has released to date, as his next album, &quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot; (2001), features classical compositions with solo piano performed by Hyung-ki &quot;Richard&quot; Joo. Since &quot;River of Dreams&quot;, Joel has recorded occasional pop/rock singles and continues to play live.

The album cover was a painting by Joel&#x27;s then-wife, Christie Brinkley. In 1993, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave her the &quot;Top Picks&quot; award for &quot;The Best Album Cover of the Year&quot;.

The same cover, in 2024, was named one of the worst 50 album covers of all time by Rolling Stone.

==Background==
In the summer of 1992, Billy Joel held a series of writing and recording sessions on Shelter Island, New York; these sessions eventually produced seven tracks, self-produced by Joel.

Joel was dissatisfied with the results, and so, on the recommendation of Don Henley, he brought in session guitarist Danny Kortchmar for another take on the songs. Kortchmar agreed to produce, provided he be allowed to use session musicians on the recordings, to which Joel agreed. Only one song from the Shelter Island sessions, &quot;Shades of Grey&quot;, would make the final album in its original produced form.

In a 2018 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, Joel expressed disappointment that the album did not yield any hit singles beyond the title track. He further attributed his decision to stop releasing pop albums to the lack of airplay. &quot;The thing was, I put a lot of work into &quot;River of Dreams&quot; and it was as if the business had left me behind because there are substantial songs on that album that never went anywhere. So I said, &#x27;What&#x27;s the point of putting myself through writing and recording if it doesn&#x27;t mean what it&#x27;s supposed to mean out there in the world?&#x27;&quot;

==Aftermath==
&quot;River of Dreams&quot; stands as Billy Joel&#x27;s most recent studio album of original material in the pop/rock genre. Joel has often stated that the album was designed to stand as his final record and that while he still composes music, he no longer writes within the pop/rock music vein and has no more interest in the recording industry. Joel&#x27;s succeeding studio album &quot;Fantasies &amp; Delusions&quot;, released in 2001, was an instrumental album of classical piano pieces containing no pop songs whatsoever. In 2019, a group of Billy Joel fans created a petition at Change.org asking him to put out at least one more studio album with new songs of original materials in the pop/rock genre, but it obtained less than 300 signatures, and some of the signatories stated that they wanted Joel to record cover songs or remakes of his earlier hits rather than new material.

<doc id="953065" wikidata="Q714516" url="?curid=953065" title="Brian Sandoval">
<text>Brian Edward Sandoval ( ; born August 5, 1963) is an American politician, academic administrator, and former federal judge who served as the 29th Governor of Nevada from 2011 to 2019.

A graduate of the University of Nevada, Reno, Sandoval began his political career in the early 1990s. In 1998 he was appointed to be a member of the Nevada Gaming Commission and later served as the commission&#x27;s chairman from 1999 to 2001. A Republican, Sandoval ran and won the position of Nevada Attorney General and served from 2003 until 2005, when President George W. Bush nominated Sandoval to serve as judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada.

Sandoval ran for governor in 2010. He defeated incumbent governor Jim Gibbons for the Republican nomination and later defeated Democratic nominee Rory Reid in the general election. He was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democrat Bob Goodman in the state&#x27;s largest electoral landslide. Sandoval was barred by term limits from running for a third term in 2018. He was succeeded by Democrat Steve Sisolak.

Since October 2020, Sandoval has served as the 17th president of the University of Nevada, Reno. 

==Early life and education==
Sandoval was born in Redding, California, to Ron Sandoval (an FAA maintenance supervisor) and his wife Gloria (Gallegos) Sandoval (a legal secretary). A long-time resident of Reno, Sandoval is of Hispanic ancestry. Sandoval attended Reno&#x27;s Little Flower School and graduated from Bishop Manogue High School in Reno in 1981; he attended the University of Nevada, Reno, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and economics in 1986. He then went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law in 1989.

== Early career ==
Sandoval passed the Nevada and California bar exams and entered private practice with several Reno law firms. In 1999, he opened his own law firm in Reno.

===Nevada Assembly===
====Elections====
When incumbent Republican Jim Gibbons decided to retire to run for Governor of Nevada in 1994, Sandoval ran for the Reno-based 25th District of the Nevada Assembly. He won the open seat and won re-election in 1996. After he resigned from his seat in 1998, Gibbons&#x27; wife Dawn won the open seat.

====Tenure====
Sandoval sponsored 14 bills that became law—including some that prevented felons from suing victims if they are injured committing a crime, increased the penalties for operating a boat under the influence, and allowed indigent defendants to perform community service to defray their legal costs.

====Committee assignments====
Sandoval served on the Judiciary, Taxation and Natural Resources Committees. He also served on the Wisconsin Legislative Commission, the Advisory Commission on Sentencing, the Juvenile Justice Commission, the Advisory Council on Community Notification of Sex Offenders, and the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency Oversight Committee.

===Gaming Commission of Nevada===
In 1998, Sandoval was appointed to serve as a member of the Gaming Commission of Nevada, which oversees the state&#x27;s gaming industry. The following year, at the age of 35, Sandoval became the youngest person ever to serve as chairman of the gaming commission. During his time on the commission, Sandoval fought national efforts to block gambling on college sports events, worked on regulations limiting neighborhood gaming and worked for regulations prohibiting slot machines with themes attractive to children.

==Attorney General of Nevada==
===2002 election===
Sandoval announced his bid on October 11, 2001, to succeed three-term Democrat Frankie Sue Del Papa who was not eligible to run for re–election as Attorney General of Nevada due to lifetime term limits established by the Nevada Constitution in 1996. His primary major party opposition was Democratic attorney John Hunt from Las Vegas, whom Sandoval defeated by a margin of 58.32% to 33.63% on November 5, 2002. Sandoval took office on January 6, 2003.

===Tenure===
While Attorney General, Sandoval led the state&#x27;s legal fight against the storage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, developed Nevada&#x27;s first Public Integrity Unit and sponsored legislation strengthening Nevada&#x27;s laws against domestic violence, drug abuse and human trafficking.

As attorney general, Sandoval was also the chairman and a member of several state boards and commissions, including the Nevada Boards of Pardons, Prisons, Transportation, and Examiners; the Cyber-Crime Task Force; the Committee on Domestic Violence, and the Prosecutorial Advisory Council.

==Federal district judge==
===Nomination===
In the fall of 2004, Democratic Senator Harry Reid spoke with Sandoval about whether he was interested in serving as a judge for the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and that December, Reid recommended to President George W. Bush that he nominate Sandoval to a future opening on that court. Sandoval was formally nominated by Bush on March 1, 2005, to the seat being vacated by Judge Howard D. McKibben.

On September 29, 2005, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a confirmation hearing on Sandoval&#x27;s nomination. On October 20, 2005, the Judiciary committee reported Sandoval&#x27;s nomination out of committee on a voice vote. Sandoval was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate on October 24, 2005 by an 89–0 vote (with 11 Senators not voting). Sandoval received his judicial commission on October 26, 2005.

===Tenure===
Sandoval announced his resignation as Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada on August 15, 2009, to become effective beginning September 15, 2009. On the same day as his resignation became official, Sandoval announced he was running for the Governorship. Sandoval&#x27;s chambers were in the Bruce R. Thompson Courthouse and Federal Building in Reno.

==Governor of Nevada==
===2010 election===

On June 9, 2010, on the Republican primary, Sandoval defeated incumbent Governor Jim Gibbons. In the general election, Sandoval won 53%–41%, against Democrat Rory Reid, the Clark County Commissioner and son of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He won every county in the state, and all with a majority except Clark County, where Las Vegas is the county seat, which Sandoval won with a plurality (49%–47%).

===2014 election===

Sandoval ran for re-election in 2014. He won the Republican primary with 90% of the vote. In the general election, Sandoval defeated Democrat Bob Goodman with over 70% of the vote.

===Tenure===

Sandoval, as the state&#x27;s 29th Governor, proposed a $5.8 billion 2011 budget without any new taxes. It could cause as many as 361 layoffs and 5% pay reductions for state workers. It also included a 5% cut in primary education and 7% cut in higher education. Sandoval turned down a pay raise that would have increased his salary from $141,000 to $149,573 per year. He also has said he will take a 5% pay cut to coincide with every other state worker&#x27;s.

The final budget for 2011 avoided deep cuts to education and human services programs. It contained a number of reforms that include ending teacher tenure as well as the practice of deciding layoffs based solely on teacher seniority, allowing local governments to re-open employee contracts during financial emergencies as well as barring collective bargaining by supervisors, and eliminating retirement health insurance for new state employees hired after January 1, 2012.

He appointed U.S. Congressman Dean Heller (R–Carson City) to became U.S. Senator, after the seat become vacant from the resignation of John Ensign.

On September 11, 2014, Sandoval signed a package bill to provide $1.3 billion in tax breaks and subsidies over 20 years for Tesla Motors in exchange for building the massive Gigafactory 1 battery factory in the state, near Reno. The factory is key to Nevada&#x27;s efforts to revitalize its economy, which was hard-hit by the mortgage meltdown and the Great Recession and has yet to fully recover. 
In June 2015, Sandoval signed several bills designed to overhaul Nevada&#x27;s education system. The reforms substantially increased funding for public schools and grants and created incentives to recruit more teachers and promote professional training. $10 million were appropriated for preschool programs and an expansion of full-day kindergarten across Nevada.

Sandoval is widely regarded as a moderate Republican, supporting abortion, Obamacare, immigration reform, and renewable energy. Sandoval was suggested by Senator Harry Reid as a potential nominee to fill the seat of deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, given his judicial experience as well as his moderate reputation; however, Sandoval quickly withdrew himself from consideration.

On March 21, 2016, Sandoval met with Mark Davis, owner of the NFL&#x27;s Oakland Raiders, about moving the Raiders to Las Vegas, Nevada. On October 14, 2016, Sandoval signed a bill that would provide $750 million in public funding for Allegiant Stadium which would open four years later for the Raiders and the UNLV Rebels football program in July 2020.

On July 12, 2016, Sandoval launched a comprehensive review of Nevada&#x27;s juvenile justice system and established the Statewide Juvenile Justice Improvement Task Force. Nevada was selected to receive technical assistance from The Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center through a grant from the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Following the launch, the CSG Justice Center conducted an analysis of the state&#x27;s juvenile justice system and made recommendations to the task force based on its assessment.

On May 17, 2017, Sandoval signed Senate Bill 201, which would ban psychotherapists from performing conversion therapy on minors.

===Solar issues===

Sandoval came under criticism in 2015 by the rooftop solar industry in Nevada after claims that the Governor failed to act on a statewide net energy metering cap of 235MW. The cap stirred controversy due to its ability to negatively affect the future of the largely successful solar industry in Nevada, specifically related to the loss of thousands of in-state jobs. A statewide study conducted by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada previously deemed net metering a benefit to all ratepayers.

At the end of July 2015, NV Energy proposed new rates for rooftop solar users. NV Energy specifically states in its proposal that the new rates could eliminate all savings for solar customers.

On August 20, 2015, the controversial 235 MW net metering cap was hit. Immediately before the cap was hit, Vivint Solar pulled out of the state only two weeks after entering. This resulted in layoffs of many recently hired Nevadans, signaling the future of the industry in Nevada without net metering.

In December 2015, a solar company operating in Nevada filed a lawsuit against Governor Brian Sandoval to compel the release of public records the Governor&#x27;s office withheld. The withheld public records included text messages between the Governor and his staff with NV Energy&#x27;s lobbyists. The company claims that the public has the right to know the impact those relationships have had on critical policy decisions, including the rooftop solar debate.

On December 22, 2015, Sandoval&#x27;s Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, composed of Chairman Paul Thomsen, Commissioner David Noble and Commissioner Alaina Burtenshaw, voted to eliminate the state&#x27;s net metering policy for rooftop solar. The aftermath of the decision resulted in widespread layoffs in the state and an outpouring of consumer backlash due to the direct penalization of current and future solar customers.

== Gaming executive ==
After leaving office, Sandoval joined MGM Resorts International as the president of global gaming development. In that role, he was responsible for leading MGM&#x27;s efforts in legalizing casino gambling in Japan and public policy around sports betting in the United States. He left the position in April 2020 to apply for the position of president of the University of Nevada, Reno. In February 2025, concurrently with serving as president of UNR, Sandoval was named to the board of directors of Resorts World Las Vegas, an effort to provide local oversight over a casino which had been mired with issues.

== President of University of Nevada, Reno ==
On September 17, 2020, Sandoval was named as UNR&#x27;s 17th president (following Marc Johnson). He is considered an unusual choice because his background does not include any experience in higher education administration. He is the first Hispanic president of the university, as well as the first alumnus of the University to serve as its President. As UNR president, Sandoval has pushed to expand enrollment to 25,000 students by 2030 in what he calls the &quot;Wolf Pack Way&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
Sandoval has received the following awards and certificates: the Hispanics in Politics&#x27; 1996 &quot;Broche de Oro Award&quot;; the Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s 2003 &quot;Torch of Liberty Award;&quot; the Nevada State Bar&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Access to Justice Public Lawyer Award;&quot; The Latino Coalition&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Most Influential Hispanic in the U.S. Award&quot;; and the 2004 University of Nevada &quot;Alumnus of the Year Award.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sandoval married Kathleen Teipner in 1990. With Kathleen, the program director for the Children&#x27;s Cabinet in Reno, Sandoval has three children. He and his wife announced their separation in 2017 and finalized their divorce in 2018, stating the demands of public life as the main reason. Sandoval remarried Lauralyn McCarthy, a Las Vegas gaming executive on August 11, 2018.

<text>Douglas Joseph Cardinal (born 7 March 1934) is a Canadian architect based in Ottawa, Ontario. His style of architecture is influenced by his Indigenous heritage as well as European Expressionist architecture. Cardinal is perhaps best known for his designs of the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec (1989) and the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. (1998). He is considered one of Canada&#x27;s most influential contemporary architects.

==Life==
Born in Calgary, Alberta, to parents Joseph and Frances Cardinal, Douglas Cardinal is the oldest of eight children. He is a member of the Siksika Nation. His father was of Siksika (Blackfoot), French, and Ojibwe heritage, while his mother was of German, French and Mohawk/Métis descent. His mother worked as a nurse and was well educated. Cardinal&#x27;s parents met in 1926, and in the first half of the 20th century, women had very little status and rights. The patriarchal society did not recognize educated women like Frances Cardinal. However, his father&#x27;s tribe&#x27;s societal norms accepted a matrilineal culture, where women are very respected and admired. These cultural ideas shaped Cardinal&#x27;s upbringing and affected his worldview and relationship with his heritage. He has recalled that his mother told him at a young age, &quot;You’re going to be an architect.&quot;
Cardinal grew up a couple of miles outside the small city of Red Deer, Alberta. Cardinal was educated at St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent Catholic, a boarding school for children who lived in the country and wanted to go beyond Grade 8, which was all that most one-room country schools offered. Cardinal finished high school there. The much-loved Daughters of Wisdom who ran the boarding school taught both Catholic and Protestant children there, and like many other boarders, Cardinal was taught about arts and culture by the Sisters. He has said that this religious school influenced him immensely. Living a few miles away from the rest of his family made him focus on his academic achievements. Traditional sacred architecture and its role in culture made him want to create spaces as powerful and inspirational as churches and basilicas. It also ignited in him a passion for architecture in those early years.

In 1953, he started studying architecture at the University of British Columbia (UBC) but was forced to leave two years later due to his radical ideas. His different approach toward architecture did not align with the ideas of modernism at the time. He wanted to create buildings responding to nature and the organic rhythm of life, which was unprecedented in the 1950s. In his third year of studies, he was told by the director of UBC that he had &quot;a wrong background&quot; for the program and the profession. After he left Vancouver and returned to Red Deer to start working at local architectural firms as a draftsman. His ejection from UBC made it impossible for him to apply to Canadian universities again. Cardinal also wanted a change of scenery due to racism towards Indigenous people in his home country so decided to head south, stopping in Arizona and Mexico, and later settling in Texas. Eventually, he attended the University of Texas at Austin, from which he graduated with a degree in architecture in 1963.

In university, he also studied cultural anthropology, due to his cultural heritage and philosophy based on the sacredness of life and nature. He wanted to study people and did not feel that the buildings around him were designed around people. His philosophy was inspired by architect Rudolph Steiner, whom Douglas studied at the University of Texas. Steiner&#x27;s work led Douglas to study anthropomorphism, which he applied to his work. The idea of anthropomorphism and its concept of responding to human behavior, natural cycles of life, and the beauty of sacred land and tectonics aligned with Cardinal&#x27;s cultural heritage. Another inspiration for Cardinal was the works of Frank Lloyd Wright. He appreciated his organic way of responding to the landscape with the use of natural materials, such as stone and brick. In Texas, he accepted his Indigenous heritage, and one of his professors even encouraged him to learn more about his background.

==Career==
Cardinal opened his private practice in 1964, and the same year he was commissioned to design St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Red Deer, Alberta. Construction was completed in 1968, and it has since been recognized as a prominent example in the history of Canadian architecture. In 2007, the church was featured on a Canada Post stamp series featuring four Canadian architects to commemorate the centennial of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC).

Beginning with his work on St. Mary&#x27;s, Cardinal was one of the first North American architects to use computers to assist in the design process. His curvilinear designs reflect the landscape around them, so that people making use of the building can retain a sense of the surrounding land. He found that the use of computerized design would fit best for his unusual designs and the use of shapes. He also found 3D programs very useful for laying out the exact dimensions of buildings.

In 1993, he was hired by the Smithsonian Institution as the Primary Design Architect for the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI). The NMAI is currently situated on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and is directly across from the Capitol of the United States of America. After contractual disputes, Cardinal was removed from the project in 1998 before it was completed, but he continued to provide input into the building&#x27;s design.

In 2008, his firm was hired by the Kirkland Foundation to design a museum/convention center in Union City, Tenn. The Discovery Park of America was to be a unique structure housing a multi level museum with artifacts from across the nation as well as provide a place for large conventions/meetings for the community. Early in 2009 the firm&#x27;s contract was terminated with the owner, and all construction activity was halted, due to undisclosed differences between the two parties.
=== Architectural style and philosophy ===
Throughout his early years, Douglas Cardinal was dealing with racism and societal ideas of conformity for both his lifestyle and architecture. Only in his years in Texas he started to fully embrace his indigenous heritage and learn more about it. In 1970s Cardinal developed his trademark architectural style with organic curvilinear forms. In those years he started wearing native clothes and necklaces, as well as becoming an advocate for indigenous rights. This spiritual connection with his native culture affected and influenced his work and unique architectural approach. Many philosophical ideas of indigenous history include its respect and sensibility towards nature, humans&#x27; inseparable relationship with the environment and land. These concepts resulted in his use of natural materials, organic shapes, soil and sun studies, as well as creating spaces that move people spiritually and make them appreciative of their surroundings. The native philosophy is also very contrasting from the Western civilization worldview due to its use of time. It is appreciative of resilience of nature and its ability to withstand hard conditions. Therefore, its architecture aims to last for seven generations, as opposed to the economically driven and efficient approach of the patriarchal society.
=== St. Mary&#x27;s Church ===
St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Red Deer, Alberta is Cardinal&#x27;s first building. Upon his return to Alberta, Cardinal met with Father Werner Merx, who wanted the new church to be innovative and unique. The archbishop of the church has already appointed another architect for the job, but Merx insisted on hiring Cardinal and realizing his vision. The archbishop whom they needed to convince turned out to be Anthony Jordan, who helped to resolve legal case for Cardinal 10 years earlier. Douglas Cardinal was approved for a job.

The church has 750 seats inside and includes tubular skylights for natural daylight. Cardinal started his first project in 1967 and it turned out to be so challenging that he doubted if he could survive its completion. However, the building became one of his iconic designs that determined his architectural style. He combined all of his philosophical and cultural ideas and created a church that represented his many beliefs towards the nature and organic forms, that is unique and unprecedented for its time.

=== Canadian Museum of History ===
This building, opened in 1989 as Canadian Museum of Civilization at the time, is another project that is very representative of Cardinal&#x27;s architectural style. Influenced by his indigenous heritage it focuses on the response to its surroundings. It is located on the banks of the Ottawa River, facing Parliament Hill. All the massive government buildings in the city center are clustered and turned away from the river. Cardinal opened the Great Hall towards the river, making it the only building in the area that is responding to it. This approach also translated into the wrapping facade with curves that can embrace and invite people inside and create welcoming environment. The envelope of the building is shaped in an organic form, as if sculptured by the forces of nature. He also wanted to acknowledge his appreciation for the Parliament by using the same limestone as the one used in the building. Besides responding to the site conditions, the museum also engages with its historic context by including totem poles and native murals inside the building. He wanted the space inside feel alive and dynamic, and not limit its form to the programmatic requirements. Former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau also encouraged Cardinal to create a museum where people embrace their different backgrounds and learn from each other. Prime minister&#x27;s idea for multicultural Canadian society aligned well with Cardinal&#x27;s vision. The overall concept and purpose of the building corresponded with his ideas. However, in 1984 the new Brian Mulroney government was not approving of Cardinal&#x27;s design. He then lost his team on the project and was not fully paid for his previous work. This was a tremendous loss for the architect, but he was too driven to fulfill this project and was not willing to give up. After long years of defending his design, he eventually finished the museum and it became one of his many fundamental projects.

=== The Group of Seven ===
In 20th century, there were several artistic hierarchies, such as Canadian Group of Seven. Cardinal was part of a similar group that included some of Canada&#x27;s most influential architects, such as Moshe Safdie, Raymond Moriyama, Eberhard Zeidler, Arthur Erickson, Ray Affleck and Ron Thom. This environment was encouraging for the architect and they often shared ideas and passion to create great architecture. Although all of their styles and conceptual vision were different, they all agreed on creating with meaning and beauty, instead of commercial skyscrapers of that era. However, his personal and financial problems often made him lose his direction and consequently he did not receive as much recognition as his peers. These instances include his design of the Grand Prairie Regional College in Alberta. Opened in 1974, this project did not meet government&#x27;s simplistic and modernistic vision for the project and went over budget.

== Personal life ==
Cardinal has been married four times and has eight children. After his return to Red Deer, Douglas Cardinal met his former high school sweetheart Deirdre. Her Irish Catholic family did not accept of their relationship because of his heritage and the two of them eloped. This also was a problem, because Cardinal had charges pressed against him as an interracial marriage was illegal at the time. He was defended by the archbishop lawyer Anthony Jordan and was not found guilty. Deirdre then was pressured to move back with her family, and was raising their first daughter alone.

Shortly before he decided to go the United States, he started a relationship with Carole Olson. She accompanied him on a road trip 1957 to Texas and they later got married. They had three children - Nancy, Guy and Bret. The couple split during their years in America due to his preoccupation with work. His son Bret is also an architect and has worked with his father for 25 years until he started his own architecture firm.

He married Marylin Zahar in 1973, with whom he had two children - Lisa and Jean-Marc.

His fourth and current wife, Idoia Arana-Beobide, is of Basque origin and 30 years his junior. The two met in 1988 when his designs for the Canadian Museum of History were being constructed. At the time, she was a tour guide for the museum and an international student taking a museum studies course at a local community college. Together they have two children, Aritz and Lorea, and reside in Ottawa. His wife works as a director at his architectural firm.

<text>Maeve Kinkead (born May 31, 1946) is an American soap opera actress, writer and poet.

==Career==
After numerous roles on stage, Kinkead&#x27;s first major role was as Angie Perrini on the soap &quot;Another World&quot; (1975–80). Her longest running role was as Vanessa Chamberlain on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She played the role on a contract basis from June 2, 1980 to August 28, 1981, February 1, 1982 to September 1996, and April 1997 to September 5, 2000. She garnered five Daytime Emmy nominations during her time on the show, winning for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 1992. In 1993, she received her first nomination as Outstanding Lead Actress.

In 2000, Kinkead left &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She made special guest appearances as Vanessa in 2002 for Guiding Light&#x27;s 65th anniversary on-screen. In 2005, Kinkead returned, and was included in the 70th anniversary cast photo. Kinkead appeared as Vanessa until the series finale on September 18, 2009. 

== Other work ==
In 2008, Kinkead graduated from the Warren Wilson College Master of Fine Arts Program for Writers with a degree in poetry. She released her first book of poetry, &quot;A Dangling House&quot;, in 2017.

==Personal life==
Kinkead lives in New York City with her husband Harry Streep, brother of actress Meryl Streep, and their children.

Kinkead was diagnosed with breast cancer (time frame unknown). In 2006, she appeared on the PBS program &quot;The New Medicine&quot;, hosted by Dana Reeve (who died of lung cancer the same year), in a segment that discussed the comfort level patients have when they are interacting with physicians, and how empowered they feel about talking to their physicians about health concerns.

<doc id="953076" wikidata="Q15521618" url="?curid=953076" title="Francis Evans Cornish">
<text>Francis Evans Cornish (February 1, 1831 – November 28, 1878) was a Canadian politician. He served as Mayor of London, Canada West, in the early 1860s, became the first Mayor of Winnipeg in 1874, and was for a time a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

==Early life and education==
Cornish was born in London (then in Upper Canada), to a family that had moved to Canada from England twelve years earlier. He was educated in London, articled in law, and was called to the bar of Canada West in 1855. At age 26, he was appointed a QC. He was a successful lawyer, and was involved in the local masonic and Orange lodges.

==Political career==
London was incorporated as a city in 1855, and Cornish was elected as an alderman in its seventh ward three years later. He was re-elected in 1859 and 1860. In May 1860, Cornish ran as a Conservative candidate in the riding of Middlesex East, in a by-election for the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislature. He was defeated by R. Craik, a Liberal. There was a second Conservative candidate in the race, and some suspect that Cornish deliberately split the Conservative vote to permit a Liberal victory.

Cornish was elected Mayor of London in 1861, and held the position for the next four years. He was responsible for resolving a scandal at the city&#x27;s hospital, and oversaw the city&#x27;s first serious efforts to reduce fire hazards in its central region. The most notorious incident of his tenure as mayor occurred in 1863, when he physically attacked a British commander who boasted of an affair with Cornish&#x27;s wife. He was convicted of assault, and fined eight dollars.

Cornish often resorted to dubious means to win elections, and received assistance from members of the local Orange Order. He was defeated for the mayoralty in 1865, when his opponent David Glass successfully petitioned for the local militia to oversee the civic proceedings.

Cornish ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1871 provincial election, but was defeated by John Carling, a local brewer and fellow Conservative. Cornish&#x27;s loyalty to the Conservative Party was ambiguous in this period, and some sources believe he favoured the Liberals.

Although he was re-elected to London&#x27;s municipal council in 1871, Cornish had little interest in the city. He moved to Winnipeg in 1872, and assisted in developing of the new province&#x27;s legal system. He became a spokesman for recent Ontario immigrants, and forged a political alliance with John Christian Schultz&#x27;s Canadian Party. Schultz&#x27;s followers opposed the province&#x27;s &quot;consensus government&quot; and were often involved in violent activities against the local Métis population.

Against the wishes of prime minister John A. Macdonald, Cornish coordinated the arrest of Ambroise-Dydime Lepine in 1873. Lepine had been the adjutant-general in Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government, and his arrest sparked bitter divisions among the province&#x27;s English-speaking and French-speaking communities. Cornish served as leader for the prosecution in Lepine&#x27;s trial, which resulted in a conviction and a death sentence (later commuted to a minor jail sentence).

Winnipeg was formally incorporated as a city in 1873, and Cornish declared himself a candidate for the city&#x27;s mayoralty. On January 5, 1874, he defeated William F. Luxton by a margin of 383 votes to 179. It may be noted that there were only 382 eligible voters in the city at the time, but that property owners were allowed to vote in every civic poll in which they owned property. Cornish&#x27;s followers exploited this rule to their benefit.

In the 1874 provincial election, Cornish declared himself a candidate for the Manitoba legislature in the constituency of Poplar Point. He ran as an opponent of premier Robert A. Davis&#x27;s ministry (which was primarily supported by francophones), and defeated his sole opponent, Robert Hastie, by a margin of 92 votes to 65. Cornish subsequently allowed his name to stand for re-election as mayor of Winnipeg, but paid little attention to the campaign. He was defeated by William Kennedy, 218 votes to 164.

Early in 1875, opposition leader John Norquay entered the cabinet of Premier Davis and brought several of his Anglophone followers to the government side. Cornish did not join Norquay, and emerged as the leader of the parliamentary opposition. He was again accused of fomenting violence in an 1876 municipal election, and was fined twenty dollars for his role in an altercation.

Cornish was asked to run as a Liberal candidate in the 1878 federal election of 1878, but declined. His party affiliation was still ambiguous in this period. He declared himself a &quot;National&quot; in federal politics, and is generally considered to have been a Conservative, albeit of an independent stripe, during his time in the Manitoba legislature. Like John Christian Schultz, he gradually left his Ontario Conservative background, and sometimes aligned himself with a &quot;Liberal&quot; position when opposing the provincial government.

Cornish was elected as an alderman to the municipal council of Winnipeg in 1878. He was also planning to run for re-election to the provincial legislature, but died from cancer of the stomach in November.

In his history of Manitoba&#x27;s legal system, Bruce MacFarlane describes Cornish as &quot;by most accounts a brash and rude man, but extremely intelligent. Best known as the first mayor of Winnipeg, he was also decidedly anti-Catholic, anti-Métis and especially anti-Riel&quot;.

<text>Sericulture, or silk farming, is the cultivation of silkworms to produce silk. Although there are several commercial species of silkworms, the caterpillar of the domestic silkmoth is the most widely used and intensively studied silkworm. This species of silkmoth is no longer found in the wild as they have been modified through selective breeding, rendering most flightless and without defense against predators. Silk is believed to have first been produced in China as early as the Neolithic period. Sericulture has become an important cottage industry in countries such as Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, and Thailand. Today, China and India are the two main producers, with more than 60% of the world&#x27;s annual production.

==History==
According to Confucian text, the discovery of silk production dates to about 2700 BCE, although archaeological records point to silk cultivation as early as the Yangshao period (5000–3000 BCE). In 1977, a piece of ceramic created 5400–5500 years ago and designed to look like a silkworm was discovered in Nancun, Hebei, providing the earliest known evidence of sericulture. Also, by careful analysis of archaeological silk fibre found on Indus Civilization sites dating back to 2450–2000 BCE, it is believed that silk was being used over a wide region of South Asia. By about the first half of the 1st century CE, it had reached ancient Khotan, by a series of interactions along the Silk Road. By 140 CE, the practice had been established in India. In the 6th century CE, the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire led to its establishment in the Mediterranean, remaining a monopoly in the Byzantine Empire for centuries (Byzantine silk). In 1147, during the Second Crusade, Roger II of Sicily (1095–1154) attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Palermo and Calabria, eventually spreading the industry to Western Europe.

==Production==
The silkworms are fed with mulberry leaves, and after the fourth moult, they climb a twig placed near them and spin their silken cocoons. The silk is a continuous filament comprising fibroin protein, secreted from two salivary glands in the head of each worm, and a gum called sericin, which cements the filaments.
The sericin is removed by placing the cocoons in hot water, which frees the silk filaments and readies them for reeling. This is known as the degumming process. The immersion in hot water also kills the silkmoth pupa.

Single filaments are combined to form thread, in a process called &quot;throwing&quot;, which is drawn under tension through several guides and wound onto reels. This process of throwing produces various yarns depending on the amount and direction of the twisting. The threads may be plied to form yarn (short staple lengths are spun; see silk noil). After drying, the raw silk is packed according to quality.

== Sustainable silk ==

=== Peace silk ===
The most popular substitute for traditional silk is peace silk, also known as ahimsa silk. The primary factor that makes this form of silk more ethical is that moths are permitted to emerge from their cocoons and fly away prior to boiling. It denotes that no pupa is ever cooked alive during manufacture. However, domesticated silkworms used to make silk have undergone thousands of years of selective breeding and are not &quot;manufactured&quot; to emerge from their cocoons. They are unable to defend themselves against predators since they cannot fly or see clearly. They typically die soon after emerging from their cocoons as a result.

=== Wild silk ===
The cocoons of Tussar silkworms, which are found in open woodlands, are used to produce wild silk, also known as Tussar silk. Compared to conventional silk, their cocoons are typically picked after the moths have emerged, making it a more ethical option. Because wild silkworms consume a variety of plants, their fabric is less uniform but more robust. The fabric is made with fewer chemicals as well. The pupae are still inside the cocoons when they are harvested by certain enterprises that employ &quot;wild silk&quot;, though.

===Stages of production===
The stages of production are as follows:

# The female silkmoth lays 300 to 500 eggs.
# The silkmoth eggs hatch to form larvae or caterpillars, known as silkworms.
# The larvae feed on mulberry leaves.
# Having grown and moulted several times, the silkworm extrudes a silk fibre and forms a net to hold itself.
# It swings itself from side to side in a figure &#x27;8&#x27;, distributing the saliva that will form silk. 
# The silk solidifies when it contacts the air.
# The silkworm spins approximately one mile of filament and completely encloses itself in a cocoon in about two or three days. The amount of usable quality silk in each cocoon is small. As a result, about 2,500 silkworms are required to produce a pound of raw silk.
#The intact cocoons are boiled, killing the silkworm pupa.
# The silk is obtained by brushing the undamaged cocoon to find the outside end of the filament.
# The silk filaments are then wound on a reel. One cocoon contains approximately of silk filament. The silk at this stage is known as raw silk. One thread comprises up to 48 individual silk filaments.

Mahatma Gandhi was critical of silk production based on the Ahimsa philosophy &quot;not to hurt any living thing&quot;. He also promoted &quot;Ahimsa silk&quot;, made without boiling the pupa to procure the silk and wild silk made from the cocoons of wild and semiwild silkmoths. The Human League also criticised sericulture in their early single &quot;Being Boiled&quot;. The organisation PETA has also campaigned against silk.

== Pupae as food ==
The conventional method of silk production results in ~8 kg of wet silkworm pupae and ~2 kg of dry pupae per kilogram of raw silk. This byproduct has historically been consumed by people in silk-producing areas.

== Politics ==
The first councillor was Fani Francis Sizimbo, a Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) member, who won the inaugural 1992 regional election and was in office until 1998. In the 1998 regional election the constituency was won by Lichaba John Ndubano in 1998. Ndubano, a SWAPO member, moved the SWAPO office from Linyanti to Sangwali. At that time the Caprivi conflict was simmering in the area. Ndubano did not support secessionism, and as a result was not liked in secessionist dominated areas.

In the 2004 regional elections SWAPO was represented by Dorothy Kabula. She received 2,473 of the 3,969 votes cast and became councillor. In 2010 Cletius Sipapela, also SWAPO, won the constituency elections. In the 2015 regional election Sipapela was reelected with 1,480 votes, followed by Ivene Visitor Kabunga of the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 1,191 votes. Charles Wuyeni Matemwa of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) also ran and received 19 votes.

The 2020 regional election was won by Ivene Vistor Kabunga, an independent candidate. He received 1,903 votes and serves as the Linyanti Constituency Councillor. SWAPO&#x27;s candidate Mwangala Sonnia Musukubili came second with 925 votes.

==Traditional authorities==
Linyanti is the only constituency in the region with three Kings: King Mayuni of the Mashi Traditional Authority, King Shufu of the Bayeyi and King Mamili of the Mafwe. Over decades, King Mamili was the sole traditional authority in the constituency until the Bayeyi declared themselves an independent tribe in 1992 and Mayuni divorced himself in 1994 to form the Mashi Traditional Authority.

<doc id="953086" wikidata="Q612787" url="?curid=953086" title="Hicetas">
<text>Hicetas ( or ; c. 400 – c. 335 BC) was a Greek philosopher of the Pythagorean School. He was born in Syracuse, Magna Graecia. Like his fellow Pythagorean Ecphantus and the Academic Heraclides Ponticus, he believed that the daily movement of permanent stars was caused by the rotation of the Earth around its axis. When Copernicus referred to &quot;Nicetus Syracusanus&quot; (Nicetus of Syracuse) in &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; as having been cited by Cicero as an ancient who also argued that the Earth moved, it is believed that he was actually referring to Hicetas.

Cicero refers to Hicetas in the &quot;Academica,&quot; volume II, citing in turn Theophrastus. According to Heath:
:Cicero [says] “Hicetas of Syracuse, as Theophrastus says, holds that the heaven, the sun, the moon, the stars and in fact all things in the sky remain still, and nothing else in the universe moves, except the earth; but as the earth turns and twists about its axis with extreme swiftness, all the same results follow as if the earth were still and the heaven moved&quot;. This is of course not well expressed…but Cicero means no more than that the rotation of the earth is a complete substitute for the apparent daily rotation of the heaven as a whole.

<text>Tourism holds considerable significance as a pivotal industry within Mexico&#x27;s economic landscape. Beginning in the 1960s, it has been vigorously endorsed by the Mexican government, often heralded as &quot;an industry without smokestacks,&quot; signifying its non-polluting and economically beneficial nature. 

Mexico has consistently ranked among the world&#x27;s most frequented nations, as documented by the World Tourism Organization. Second only to the United States in the Americas, Mexico&#x27;s status as a premier tourist destination is underscored by its standing as the sixth-most visited country globally for tourism activities, as of 2017. The country boasts a noteworthy array of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, encompassing ancient ruins, colonial cities, and natural reserves, alongside a plethora of modern public and private architectural marvels. 

Mexico has attracted foreign visitors beginning in the early nineteenth century, with its cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts. Mexico&#x27;s allure to tourists is largely attributed to its temperate climate and distinctive cultural amalgamation, blending European and Mesoamerican influences. The nation experiences peak tourism seasons typically during December and the mid-Summer months. Additionally, brief spikes in visitor numbers occur in the weeks preceding Easter and Spring break, notably drawing college students from the United States to popular beach resort locales.

Visitors to Mexico originates primarily from the United States and Canada. Additionally, Mexico attracts visitors from various Latin American countries, with a smaller contingent coming from Europe and Asia.

==History of tourism==

===19th century===
Tourism in Mexico burgeoned subsequent to the establishment of the Mexican republic. Noteworthy figures such as Alexander von Humboldt, Frannie Calderón de la Barca, John Lloyd Stephens, and Edward B. Tylor significantly contributed to the burgeoning interest in Mexico as a tourist destination through their writings and explorations. Alexander von Humboldt, a renowned naturalist and explorer, penned detailed accounts of his travels throughout Mexico during the early 19th century. His comprehensive observations on Mexico&#x27;s geography, flora, and fauna captured the imagination of many prospective travelers, thus fostering an initial interest in the region. 

Tourists from the United States began arriving in Mexico in numbers starting in the 1880s, following the construction of direct railway lines in Mexico to the U.S. border. General Porfirio Díaz became president of Mexico by coup in 1876, the beginning of a long period of peace in Mexico following decades of civil war. With the inauguration of direct Pullman service from the U.S. to Mexico in 1884, tourists no longer endured difficult and dangerous travel. The Mexican Central Railway actively promoted tourism in the United States, hiring a professional photographer, William Henry Jackson, to visually record the route and a professional writer, James W. Steel, to write promotional copy. Guides for English-speaking tourists were also published, most notably &quot;Terry&#x27;s Guide to Mexico&quot;, which went through several editions at the beginning of the twentieth century. Mexico appealed to American tourists seeking an &quot;exotic&quot; holiday. It was promoted in 1890 as the &quot;Egypt of the New World.&quot; With the 1910 centennial of Mexican independence, the government undertook an excavation and reconstruction of the Pyramid of the Sun at the huge archeological site of Teotihuacan, near Mexico City. A railway line was constructed from the capital to the site, bringing scholars from the 1910 meeting of the International Congress of Americanists. In addition, the National Museum of Anthropology was refurbished in advance of the celebrations, in anticipation of tourists. Mexico was a beneficiary of the increasing tourism of Europeans and Americans to distant lands. In Mexico, many tourists brought home real or fake relics, and often left graffiti.

===20th and 21st centuries===

The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) interrupted tourism in Mexico, but by the 1930s, the Mexican government began promoting tourism again with posters of light-skinned young women and lush gardens. In the 1920s and 30s, there was an &quot;enormous vogue of things Mexico&quot; in the United States, resulting in cultural exchanges, temporary and permanent art exhibitions, and patronage of Mexican artists, such as muralists Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. Starting with the administration of Plutarco Elías Calles (1924–28), the Mexican government became involved in promoting tourism in Mexico, eventually becoming a cabinet position, the Ministry of Tourism in 1975.

In 1929, Mexican president Emilio Portes Gil officially announced the country&#x27;s entry into the tourism industry. Over the next few years, the industry stayed small because of the ongoing Great Depression, so the government focused its attention on research and was ready after World War II to welcome tourists who could no longer visit Europe instead.

During the Jazz Age and the era of Prohibition of alcohol in the U.S., border towns in Mexico, particularly Tijuana became destinations for vice tourism. The song &quot;South of the Border (down Mexico way)&quot; song by Frank Sinatra helped promote the region. It was known for casino gambling, glitzy floor shows, horse- and dog-racing, and other hedonistic pursuits. Chicago gangster Al Capone frequented the Agua Caliente resort, as did big names from Hollywood. &quot;Mafia chic and Hollywood star power fueled the Tijuana mystique and imbued it with ersatz glamour.&quot; When Lázaro Cárdenas became president of Mexico, 1934–40, he cracked down on casino gambling in northern Mexico, since it was a source of money and power for Cárdenas&#x27;s political rivals, former presidents Plutarco Elías Calles and Abelardo L. Rodríguez.
When Cárdenas was governor of his home state of Michoacan (1928–32) and later, when he was president of Mexico (1934–40) and beyond, he promoted tourism to Michoacan and particularly to the historic town of Pátzcuaro. He commissioned murals to show the importance of the region&#x27;s history to the history of Mexico, promoted indigenous performance in music and dance, and actively had Michoacan advertised as a tourist destination.
The Mexican government developed beach resorts in the 1940s and 1950s in Acapulco, under president Miguel Alemán, who in his post-presidency became Commissioner of Tourism. Other beach resorts on the Pacific coast were also developed, including Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and on the Baja California peninsula at Cabo San Lucas. Later on the Yucatan Peninsular the government promoted the development of Cancún. The importance of tourism in Mexico has seen its head having a cabinet-level position. Attracting tourists from the developed world spurred the construction of upscale hotels, particularly by U.S. hotel chains. San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato developed as an artists&#x27; colony. Unlike beach resorts developed by the Mexican government, San Miguel was promoted to tourists by locals.

Starting in the late twentieth century, Mexico has been alert to international venues to both protect tourist destinations such as archeological sites, colonial cities, and natural wonders listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. With the inauguration of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage program, Mexico has certified the cultural importance of Days of the Dead (2003), Mexican cuisine (2010), mariachi music (2011), and charrería (2016), among others. Private philanthropy has played an important role in the preservation and restoration of a number of Mexican sites, most prominently by entrepreneur Carlos Slim, whose Foundation for the Historic Center of the City of Mexico (&quot;Fundación del Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México&quot;) has made a significant difference in the historic core of the capital, including security concerns.

Violence and political turmoil in Mexico has been a problem which affects travel and tourism. The years of the Porfirio Díaz regime (1876-1911) saw a decrease in violence and the rise of tourism. The Mexican Revolution 1910-20 was a major civil war, but following that the Mexican government achieved a level internal security that saw the rise of tourism and cultural exchanges in the 1920s and 1930s. In recent years, with the drug war in Mexico, U.S. State Department travel advisories have alerted tourists to the dangers of certain areas of the country.

==Statistics==

The primary nations from which tourists embark on journeys to Mexico, manifesting a notable proportion of air arrivals, include the United States, Canada, and various European countries.

== Local effects ==

=== Economic effects ===
The Mexican government has often had a hand in the development of the country&#x27;s tourist sector. One reason for this was, and still is, tourism&#x27;s potential to improve the economy, as tourists spend money on accommodations, recreation, food and souvenirs. In the 1920s, the government organized studies of the economy and tourism competitors, collaborated with private companies, and created a national tourism agency in order to capitalize on the economic potential of tourists, especially those from the United States. The tourism industry in 2018 was about 8.7% of Mexico’s GDP and brought the country 215.5 billion Mexican pesos (or 10.8 billion U.S. dollars) in export earnings. That same year, it also provided jobs for over 2.3 million people, which is 6% of the total employment in the nation.  
=== Social effects ===
In the early 20th century, the development of tourism may have increased a sense of national unity and pride among Mexicans because promoting the industry required them to celebrate the unique environment, history and culture that make the country a desirable place to visit.

Much of the tourist economy is focused on large tourist centers and resort areas, some of which were set up by the government itself, such as Cancún in 1970. People from around Mexico migrate to these centers in search of employment. In many cases, the available jobs have allowed women to gain more economic independence. In other instances, where migrants leave their families to find work outside their towns, the move can disrupt family dynamics and other aspects of life back home, despite an increased income.

In places like Cancún, low-wage workers often live in cities outside of the tourist hotspot, in conditions far from that of the resorts and beaches enjoyed by foreign tourists. These people, who typically work in the service sector or construction, often don&#x27;t make enough money to be able to access these beaches or participate in any of the recreational activities they make possible through their jobs. Additionally, migrant workers can feel pressure to change their language and their clothing styles to fit in with the more Americanized culture of the areas. However, not everyone working in the tourist industry has these same issues, such as those involved with ownership, investment, and even architecture and engineering.

=== Environmental effects ===

The large-scale development of large resorts and other tourist attractions can be detrimental to the environment, as it threatens ecosystems and their biodiversity. As ecotourism becomes more popular and more tourists seek out environmentally friendly experiences in nature, the Mexican government has formulated plans to create a more sustainable industry. One common method of protecting ecosystems that is used by some NGOs and other organizations is designating protected areas. However, creating these can come at the cost of native people&#x27;s wellbeing, as it sometimes pushes them out of land they have lived off of for generations and eliminates resources previously shared by local communities.

=== Rural areas ===
In less populated rural areas, tourism and its impacts take a different shape than in large resort areas. A 2021 study done in Tlaxcala, Mexico, where religious and archaeological tourism have become popular, showed that locals have mixed opinions. 64.5% of people interviewed said that the impact of tourism was positive, and 31.5% said it was &quot;moderately positive,&quot; due to economic growth, better transportation and improved public services. Others, however, voiced concerns about traffic, disruptive street vendors catering to tourists, and an increased cost of living. Many people in this area work in the industry, at hotels, restaurants, shops, and archeological sites.

==Central Mexico==
===Mexico City===
Mexico City is the capital of Mexico, and its most important city. The historic center of Mexico City is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with ancient archeological ruins, numerous colonial-era churches, most importantly the Cathedral, and the former palace of the Viceroy of New Spain, now the National Palace. The cathedral and National Palace are both located on the main plaza, known as the Zocalo. The city has museums of many types, housing cultural treasures of Mexico&#x27;s history since ancient times to the modern era. One guide rates the National Museum of Anthropology as the top place to visit in Mexico City, located in Chapultepec Park, itself a top tourist attraction for foreign visitors and Mexico City residents. Other museums worth a visit are the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Museo Dolores Olmedo, the Franz Mayer Museum, the Frida Kahlo Museum, the Museo Rufino Tamayo, the archeological museum of the Templo Mayor, adjacent to the National Palace and cathedral; and the Museo Nacional de Historia in Chapultepec Castle, the former residence of viceroys of Mexico, Emperor Maximilian I, and presidents of Mexico until the early twentieth century.

====Gallery====
===Morelos===

Just south of Mexico City is the state of Morelos. Its capital, Cuernavaca, is nicknamed &quot;The City of Eternal Spring&quot;; its year-round benign climate attracts both national and international visitors. Top tourist attractions in Cuernavaca include the Palace of Cortés (16th-century home of the Conquistador, now a regional museum), the archeological site of Teopanzolco, and the Cuernavaca Cathedral. This latter is one of eleven Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl in the state that are considered World Heritage Sites (three others are in the State of Puebla.

Just east of Cuernavaca are the Pueblos Magicos (Magic Towns) of Tepoztlan and Tlayacapan, each with its 16th-century monastery and colorful pre-Lenten carnival. Tepoztlan is also known for its Sunday Tianguis and the Sierra de Tepoztlan with its small pyramid and spectacular view.

Further east is the city of Cuautla, where an important battle took place in 1812 during the Mexican War of Independence. General Emiliano Zapata centered many of his revolutionary activities in and around Cuautla during the Mexican Revolution.

Morelos has a large number of water parks, ranging from small, rustic parks to international attractions. There are also several pre-hispanic pyramid sites, notably that of Xochicalco.

==Southern Mexico==

Southern Mexico is the home of many surviving indigenous cultures and is a destination for many foreign and domestic tourists in Mexico. The dense indigenous populations in the prehispanic era saw the rise of civilizations, with enormous archeological sites indicating their complexity. The rugged terrain of southern Mexico and the lack of mineral wealth drawing large numbers of Spanish settlers in the colonial era and in the post-independence era has meant that southern Mexico remains highly indigenous in character.

==Oaxaca==
Oaxaca in central southern Mexico has remained highly indigenous into the modern era and the destination for tourists wishing to experience the various indigenous cultures there. The capital of the state is Oaxaca City, is where most tourists stay, after arrival by plane at the major airport. Tourists can use the capital as a base for day-trip excursions outside the capital to visit towns specializing in particular crafts, often sold in traditional local markets (tianguis). Craft-making towns include Santa María Atzompa,(pottery); San Bartolo Coyotepec, (black pottery); Ocotlán, Oaxaca (pottery); San Martín Tilcajete, fantastical carvings called (alebrijes); and Teotitlan del Valle, rugs. Oaxacan cuisine is notable, with ingredients, such as salted and dried grasshoppers (chapulines), and flavors that are regional.

Places worth visiting outside of the capital include the major archeological site of Monte Albán, as well as Mitla. There are numerous towns with markets and craft production.
==Yucatan Peninsula and Chiapas==

The peninsula has a considerable number of major archeological sites, including Chichén Itza, Uxmal, and the La Ruta Puuc, a series of small archeological sites. The state capital of Mérida was founded in the colonial era and experienced a major boom in the nineteenth century with the expansion for the market for its sisal cordage or twine, so that the city has a number of mansions of the former sisal barons. Campeche is Mexico&#x27;s only walled city.

The Mexican state of Chiapas has the archeological sites of Palenque, Bonampak, and Yaxchilán. The capital Tuxtla Gutiérrez is the gateway to the region, with a major airport. San Cristóbal de las Casas, named after the early sixteenth-century defender of indigenous rights, Fr. Bartolomé de las Casas is a colonial-era provincial city.

==Central West Mexico==
Tourist destinations include Aguascalientes, Guadalajara, Guanajuato, Manzanillo, Morelia, Pátzcuaro, Querétaro, San Miguel de Allende, and Zacatecas.

===Guadalajara===


Guadalajara, Jalisco, the second-largest Mexican city by population, is home of some of Mexico&#x27;s best known traditions, such as tequila, mariachi music and charros, or Mexican cowboys. Its similitude with western European countries mixed with modern architecture and infrastructure makes Guadalajara very attractive to tourists. Along with Mexico City and beach destinations (Cancun, Acapulco, etc.), Guadalajara is one of the most visited cities in Mexico. Cultural tourism is the main attraction, the city being home to a large number of museums, art galleries and theatres. The city is also the host of several internationally renowned events, such as the Guadalajara International Book Fair which is the most important exposition of its kind in the Spanish-speaking world, and the second largest book fair in the world. The city is known as a pioneer in the underground arts scene as well as in the electronic music world, another main touristic attraction. Its diversity of European architectural styles is a focus of attraction for tourists, in particular the Metropolitan Cathedral, the Degollado Theatre and the Hospicio Cabañas which is a World Heritage Site and one of the oldest hospital complexes in Spanish America. Other tourism activities include shopping at its world class shopping malls, or &quot;plazas&quot;, taking a tour to the surrounding areas such as the Huentitan Canyon, Tonalá, Tlaquepaque, Chapala or visiting nearby towns, which are well-connected by modern highways, such as Tequila, Puerto Vallarta or Mazamitla, depending upon whether visitors seek urban, coastal or rural getaways.

===Morelia===
Morelia, Michoacán is the Capital of the State of Michoacán. Its Historic Downtown Area (Centro Histórico) encompasses approximately 150 city blocks in the city centre, roughly corresponding to the actual area of the city at the end of the 18th century. The Centro Historico contains over 1,000 historical sites, including (but not limited to) the cathedral and the aqueduct.

==Northeast Mexico==
===Monterrey===
Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, was founded in the late 16th century. The downtown district is the oldest section in the city, surrounded by newer neighbourhoods. The Museo de Historia Mexicana (Museum of Mexican History), MARCO (Monterrey Museum of Contemporary Art), Metropolitan Museum of Monterrey and the Museum of the Palacio de Gobierno, or State House, are some of the better known museums in the city, as well as nationally. The Santa Lucia Riverwalk is a riverwalk similar to the one in San Antonio, Texas, having a length of 2.5 km (1.6 mi) and connecting the Fundidora Park with the Macroplaza, one of the largest plazas in the world.

The coastlines of Mexico harbor many stretches of beaches that are frequented by sun bathers and other visitors. On the Yucatán peninsula, one of the most popular beach destinations is the resort town of Cancún, especially among university students during spring break. Just offshore is the beach island of Isla Mujeres, and to the east is the Isla Holbox. To the south of Cancun is the coastal strip called Riviera Maya which includes the beach town of Playa del Carmen and the ecological parks of Xcaret and Xel-Há. A day trip to the south of Cancún is the historic port of Tulum. In addition to its beaches, the town of Tulum is notable for its cliff-side Mayan ruins.

On the Pacific coast is the notable tourist destination of Acapulco. Once the destination for the rich and famous, the beaches have become crowded and the shores are now home to many multi-story hotels and vendors. Acapulco is home to renowned cliff divers: trained divers who leap from the side of a vertical cliff into the surf below.

Along the coast to the south of Acapulco are the surfing beaches of Puerto Escondido, the snorkeling, harbor beach of Puerto Ángel, and the naturist beaches of Zipolite. To the north of Acapulco is the resort town of Ixtapa and the neighboring fishing town of Zihuatanejo. Further to the north are the wild and rugged surfing beaches of the Michoacán coast.

Along the central and north Pacific coast, the biggest draws are beaches of Mazatlán city and the resort town of Puerto Vallarta. Less frequented is the sheltered cove of Bahía de Navidad, the beach towns of Bahía Kino, and the black sands of Cuyutlán. San Carlos, home of the Playa los Algodones (Cotton Beach), is a winter draw, especially for retirees.

At the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula is the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, a town noted for its beaches and marlin fishing. Further north along the Gulf of California is the Bahía de La Concepción, another beach town known for its sports fishing. Closer to the United States border is the weekend draw of San Felipe, Baja California.

==Archeological sites==


*Teotihuacan
*Tula
*Monte Albán
*Chichen-Itzá

The central and southern parts of Mexico was where a number of pre-Hispanic civilizations developed, the most prominent being the Aztec, Mayan, and the Olmec as well as Zapotec and Mixtec. There are numerous tourist destinations where these ruins can be viewed. The Mexican government has taken jurisdiction of many sites, often setting guidelines for excavation, preservation, and limitations on numbers of visitors, but nearby indigenous communities, who see these sites as part of their direct cultural heritage, object to those regulations.
The Yucatán peninsula was home to the Mayan people, and many of the indigenous people still speak the language. The area also contains many sites where ruins of the Maya civilization can be visited. The richest of these are located in the eastern half of the peninsula and are collectively known as La Ruta Puuc (or La Ruta Maya). The largest of the Ruta Puuc sites is Uxmal, which was abandoned in the 12th century.
A one-hour drive to the northeast of Ruta Puuc are the surviving remains of the city of Mayapán. This settlement was controlled by Chichén Itzá to the east, now a large archaeological site with many interesting ruins. Other ruins on the peninsula include the aforementioned Tulum on the east coast, Cobá to the northwest of Tulum, Polé (now Xcaret) just south of Playa del Carmen and Calakmul in the nature reserve along the Guatemala border. However this list by no means exhausts the number of archaeological sites to be found in this area.

To the west, the state of Chiapas includes the temples and ruins of Palenque, the glyphs of the city of Yaxchilán, the painted walls of nearby Bonampak, and the remains of the fortress of Toniná. In the city of Villahermosa to the north is the Parque-Museo La Venta, with a collection of Olmec sculptures.

Along the gulf coast area in the state of Veracruz are more archaeological sites, with the Olmec ceremonial center of Tres Zapotes, the ruins of the large Totonac city of Zempoala, and the ruins of El Tajín with the Pyramid of the Niches. The city of Xalapa contains the Museo de Antropología, a notable museum featuring a collection of massive Olmec head sculptures.

In the state of Oaxaca along the Pacific coast are the ruins of Mitla, known as the &quot;City of Death&quot; and of Monte Albán, the remains of the once extensive Zapotec capital and religious center.

Moving to the north, the central region around Mexico City contains several archaeological sites. To the southwest are the massive ruins of Teotihuacán, including the Pyramid of the Sun and the Temple of Quetzalcoatl. To the southeast near the city of Cholula is the Great Pyramid, visible from the city center. Just to the north of Cholula are the well-preserved ruins of the city of Cacaxtla. Last but not least is the Toltec capital of Tula, to the north of Mexico City. In the capital itself is the largest museum in Mexico, the Museo Nacional de Antropología.

Finally, less visited than the major sites are the mysterious ruins of La Quemada, sometimes referred to as Chicomostoc, located south of Zacatecas, Zacatecas in the northern half of Mexico.

==Ethnic cultural tourism==

Tourists often also seek destinations with living indigenous cultures, such as in Oaxaca and Yucatan. Traditional markets in many small towns have a mixture of ordinary foodstuffs and supplies for the local populations, as well as market-sellers of craft goods that are locally produced. In the state of Oaxaca, various towns specialize in particular crafts, such as weaving of rugs (Teotitlan del Valle) and black pottery (Coyotepec). Some production of Mexican handcrafts and folk art is traditional, and is particularly practiced in Oaxaca, but some artisans respond to tourist demand crafting products for that market exclusively. The Guelaguetza, an annual festival of music and dance by indigenous communities in Oaxaca gives reinforcement of local traditions and deliberately seeks tourists as attendees, staged now in an amphitheater. Another event that is promoted touristically is Mexico&#x27;s Days of the Dead at the beginning of November and has been listed as a protected cultural practice, entered on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.
Towns with specialized crafts:
* San Pablito, Puebla (amate paper)
* Santa María Atzompa, Oaxaca (pottery)
* San Bartolo Coyotepec Oaxaca (pottery)
* Ocotlán, Oaxaca (pottery, blades)
* San Martín Tilcajete, Oaxaca (alebrijes)
* Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoacan (copper crafts)

==Festivals and Celebrations==

Mexico has many religious and civic festivals as well as cultural festivals of various kinds.

Since the colonial era, the Roman Catholic Church established a number of festivals, both general and local, celebrating events on the liturgical calendar. Holy Week in Mexico is observed widely, with many re-enactments of events in the last days of the life of Christ. The Christmas season runs for 12 December, the feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe to 6 January, the Feast of the Ephiphany, also known as Three Kings. There are many local religious celebrations by towns, often on the saint&#x27;s day for which they were named.
Food and drink festivals include the Alfeñique fair in Toluca; the Feria Nacional de San Marcos in Aguascalientes; the International Pasty Festival in Real del Monte, Hidalgo state; the Night of the Radishes (23 December) Oaxaca, and the Puerto Vallarta Gourmet Festival.

A major gathering of Spanish-language booksellers is the annual Guadalajara International Book Fair. The International Cervantes Festival is held annually in Guanajuato. In Oaxaca, the Oaxaca International Literary Competition and the Oaxaca Independent Film Festival are events.

About 225 cities and towns celebrate carnvales before Lent in late February or early March. The largest are in Mazatlán and the city of Veracruz, but such celebrations can be found all across the country: Morelos, Oaxaca, Tlaxcala, Chiapas, Campeche, and Puebla. The larger city &quot;carnavales&quot; employ costumes, elected queens, and parades with floats, but Carnaval celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of European influence during Mexico&#x27;s colonial period.

==Historic colonial cities==


*Campeche, Campeche. The only walled city in Mexico is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
*Cuernavaca, Morelos. Historic architecture, including the Palace of Hernán Cortés.

*Veracruz, Veracruz. The first City Hall in the Americas was settled here, as well as the historic fort of San Juan de Ulúa. The city was twice occupied by U.S. invaders (1847 and 1914).

== Ecotourism ==


In Latin America, Costa Rica is considered a model for ecotourism, and Mexico is seeking to develop this sector. Aims for what is considered success in the sector is the proportion of tourist dollars that remain in the locality rather than those outside and prevention of large numbers of ecotourists that could undermine tourists&#x27; experience of the natural wonders. Mexico has a significant number of sites designated as UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, some of which are tourist destinations.

*El Cielo Biosphere
*Barranca del Cobre
*Cascada de Texolo
*Durango
*El Nevado 
*El Rosario – in the last two months of the year, a mass migration of monarch butterflies reaches the El Rosario sanctuary near Zitácuaro, Michoacán.

According to a 2018 survey by the Medical Tourism Association, Mexico is among the top medical destinations for Americans. The Medical Tourism Index ranks Mexico as the 29th most popular destination for medical tourism. Mexico been a destination for medical tourism due to its proximity to the United States. Border towns like Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez attracted Americans seeking affordable healthcare, especially for procedures such as dental work, cosmetic surgery, and prescription medications. In recent years, Los Algodones, Baja California, a settlement of fewer than 6,000 people located on the US border near Yuma, Arizona, has become a major destination for Americans and Canadians seeking dental services. Roughly 600 dentists practice in the community, catering mainly to tourists, leading the community to be nicknamed &quot;Molar City&quot;.
