<text>Viscount Clifden, of Gowran in the County of Kilkenny, Ireland, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 12 January 1781 for James Agar, 1st Baron Clifden. He had already been created Baron Clifden, of Gowran in the County of Kilkenny, in 1776, also in the Peerage of Ireland. The Viscounts also held the titles of Baron Mendip in the Peerage of Great Britain from 1802 to 1974 (a title which is still extant and now held by the Earl of Normanton) and Baron Dover from 1836 to 1899, when this title became extinct, and &quot;Baron Robartes&quot; from 1899 to 1974, when this title became extinct, the two latter titles which were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The interrelated histories of the peerages follow below.

==Viscount Clifden==
James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden was the son of Henry Agar of Gowran Castle and the elder brother of Charles Agar, 1st Earl of Normanton. His mother was Anne Ellis, daughter of Welbore Ellis, Bishop of Meath, and sister of the politician Welbore Ellis, who in 1794 was created &quot;Baron Mendip&quot; in the Peerage of Great Britain with remainder to his three nephews Lord Clifden, the future Lord Normanton and another brother of theirs. Lord Clifden was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He represented County Kilkenny in the Irish House of Commons and Heytesbury in the British House of Commons.

In 1802, he succeeded his great-uncle Welbore Ellis, 1st Baron Mendip as second Baron Mendip according to the special remainder, and in 1804 assumed by royal license the additional arms and surname Ellis. The titles were to remain united until the extinction of the barony and viscountcy of Clifden in 1974. Lord Clifden&#x27;s only son George James Welbore Agar-Ellis was created &quot;Baron Dover&quot; in 1831 (see below), but predeceased his father. He was therefore succeeded by his grandson, the third Viscount, who had already succeeded his father as second Baron Dover in 1833. His only son, the fourth Viscount, died unmarried at an early age, when the titles passed to his uncle, the fifth Viscount. He had previously represented County Kilkenny in Parliament as a Liberal.

On his death, the barony of Dover became extinct, while he was succeeded in the other titles by his kinsman the second Baron Robartes, who became the sixth Viscount. He was the son of Thomas James Agar-Robartes, who was created Baron Robartes in 1869 (see below), son of Hon. Charles Bagenal-Agar, youngest son of the first Viscount Clifden. The sixth Viscount had earlier represented Cornwall East in Parliament as a Liberal and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire from 1906 to 1915. His eldest son Captain the Hon. Thomas Agar-Robartes sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Bodmin and St Austell, but was killed in the First World War, predeceasing his father, unmarried.

Lord Clifden was therefore succeeded by his second son, the seventh Viscount. He sat as a Liberal in the House of Lords and served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip) from 1940 to 1945 in the war-time coalition of Winston Churchill. On the death of his younger brother, the eighth Viscount, the barony and viscountcy of Clifden and barony of Robartes became extinct, while he was succeeded in the barony of Mendip according to the special remainder by his distant relative the sixth Earl of Normanton.

The family seats were Gowran Castle in Ireland and Holdenby House in Northamptonshire, while the family&#x27;s townhouse was Dover House in Whitehall, London. When the titles were inherited by the Robartes-Agar branch of the family in Agar-Robartes, the family seat was at Lanhydrock House in Cornwall.

==Baron Mendip==

The title of Baron Mendip, of Mendip in the County of Somerset, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1794 for the politician Welbore Ellis, with remainder to the three eldest sons of his sister Anne Ellis, wife of Henry Agar (which included James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden and Charles Agar, 1st Earl of Normanton). Lord Mendip died childless and was succeeded according to the special remainder by his great-nephew the second Viscount Clifden, who became the second Baron Mendip as well.

==Baron Dover==
The title of Baron Dover, of Dover in the County of Kent, was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1831 for the Whig politician the Hon. George Agar-Ellis, only son of the second Viscount Clifden. Agar-Ellis represented Heytesbury, Seaford, Ludgershall and Okehampton in the House of Commons and served under Lord Grey as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests from 1830 to 1831. On Lord Dover&#x27;s early death in 1833, the title passed to his eldest son, the second Baron. In 1836 he also succeeded his grandfather as third Viscount Clifden.

==Baron Robartes==
The title of Baron Robartes, of Lanhydrock, and of Truro in the County of Cornwall, was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1869 for Thomas Agar-Robartes, who had previously represented Cornwall East in Parliament. He was the son of Hon. Charles Bagenal-Agar, youngest son of James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden (see above). His mother was Anna Maria Hunt, great-niece and heiress of Henry Robartes, 3rd Earl of Radnor (whose titles became extinct in 1757). On 30 March 1822, he assumed the additional surname and arms of Robartes by royal licence. Lord Robartes&#x27; son, the second Baron, succeeded his kinsman as sixth Viscount Clifden in 1899. For further history of the peerages, see the Viscount Clifden above.

<text>USNS &quot;Yukon&quot; (T-AO-202) is a underway replenishment oiler operated by the Military Sealift Command to support ships of the United States Navy.

&quot;Yukon&quot;, the sixteenth ship of the &quot;Henry J. Kaiser&quot; class, was laid down at Avondale Shipyard, Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 13 May 1991 and launched on 6 February 1993. She entered non-commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of the Military Sealift Command with a primarily civilian crew on 25 March 1994. She serves in the United States Pacific Fleet.

On 27 February 2000, &quot;Yukon&quot; collided with a smaller civilian cargo ship while entering the port of Dubai in the Persian Gulf.

On 13 July 2000, &quot;Yukon&quot; collided with the amphibious transport dock USS &quot;Denver&quot; (LPD-9) during an underway replenishment about west of Hawaii. No one on either ship was injured, and there were no fuel leaks, but &quot;Yukon&quot; suffered major damage, including several large holes and dents above the water line on her starboard quarter, while a 40-foot (12.2 m) hole was torn in &quot;Denver&quot;″s bow from the second deck to the waterline. The investigation into the accident found &quot;Denver&quot; responsible. Both ships went to the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for repairs. &quot;Yukon&quot; then transited to San Francisco, California, for further repairs at the same time as her scheduled routine . &quot;Yukon&quot; returned to service in January 2001.

On 16 May 2012, &quot;Yukon&quot; collided with the amphibious assault ship after &quot;Essex&quot; suffered an apparent steering malfunction upon approach for an underway replenishment. There were no injuries and no loss of fuel was reported. Both vessels were able to continue to San Diego, California, under their own power. The crew of the USS &quot;Essex&quot; was blamed in a report.

<text>Pyroglutamic acid (also known as PCA, 5-oxoproline, pidolic acid) is a ubiquitous but understudied natural amino acid derivative in which the free amino group of glutamic acid or glutamine cyclizes to form a lactam. The names of pyroglutamic acid conjugate base, anion, salts, and esters are pyroglutamate, 5-oxoprolinate, or pidolate.

It is a metabolite in the glutathione cycle that is converted to glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase. Pyroglutamate is found in many proteins including bacteriorhodopsin. &quot;N&quot;-terminal glutamic acid and glutamine residues can spontaneously cyclize to become pyroglutamate, or enzymatically converted by glutaminyl cyclases. This is one of several forms of blocked &quot;N&quot;-termini which present a problem for &quot;N&quot;-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry, which requires a free primary amino group not present in pyroglutamic acid. The enzyme pyroglutamate aminopeptidase can restore a free &quot;N&quot;-terminus by cleaving off the pyroglutamate residue.

Pyroglutamic acid exists as two distinct enantiomers:
*(2&quot;R&quot;) or which happens to be (+) or &quot;d&quot; 
*(2&quot;S&quot;) or which happens to be (–) or &quot;l&quot;

==Metabolism==
As first discovered in 1882, pyroglutamic acid can be formed by heating glutamic acid at 180 °C, which results in the loss of a molecule of water. In living cells, it is derived from glutathione through the action of an enzyme, γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase. Pyroglutamic acid may function in glutamate storage, and acts to oppose the action of glutamate, including in the brain. It also acts on the brain&#x27;s cholinergic system; Amyloid β containing pyroglutamic acid is increased in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; this may be part of the disease process.
Increased levels of pyroglutamic acid in the blood, leading to excess in the urine (5-oxoprolinuria), can occur following paracetamol overdose, as well as in certain inborn errors of metabolism, causing high anion gap metabolic acidosis.

==Uses==
The sodium salt of pyroglutamic acid—known either as sodium pyroglutamate, sodium PCA, or sodium pidolate—is used for dry skin and hair products, as it is a humectant. It has low toxicity and is not a skin irritant, but its use in products is limited by a high price.

-pyroglutamic acid is sold online as a nootropic dietary supplement.

Magnesium pidolate, the magnesium salt of pyroglutamic acid, is found in some mineral supplements.
In a preclinical study, additional pharmacological properties of pyroglutamic acid were revealed such as anti-phosphodiesterase type 5, anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme, and anti-urease activities.

<doc id="953471" wikidata="Q2823245" url="?curid=953471" title="Carboxyglutamic acid">
<text>Carboxyglutamic acid (or the conjugate base, carboxyglutamate), is an uncommon amino acid introduced into proteins by a post-translational carboxylation of glutamic acid residues. This modification is found, for example, in clotting factors and other proteins of the coagulation cascade. This modification introduces an affinity for calcium ions. In the blood coagulation cascade, vitamin K is required to introduce γ-carboxylation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X and protein Z.

== Synthesis ==
In the biosynthesis of γ-carboxyglutamic acid, the γ-proton on glutamic acid is abstracted, and CO2 is subsequently added. The reaction intermediate is a γ-glutamyl carbanion.

This reaction is catalyzed by a carboxylase that requires vitamin K as its cofactor. It is not exactly known how vitamin K participates, but it is hypothesized that a free cysteine residue in the carboxylase converts vitamin K into an active strong base that in turn abstracts a hydrogen from glutamic acid&#x27;s γ-carbon. Then CO2 is added to the γ-carbon to form γ-carboxyglutamic acid.

== γ-Carboxyglutamic acid-rich (GLA) domain ==

A number of γ-carboxyglutamate residues are present in the γ-carboxyglutamic acid-rich (&quot;GLA&quot;) domain. This GLA domain is known to be found in over a dozen known proteins, including coagulation factors X, VII, IX, and XIV, vitamin K-dependent protein S and Z, prothrombin, transthyretin, osteocalcin, matrix Gla protein (MGP), inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, and growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6). The Gla domain is responsible for high-affinity binding of calcium ions (Ca2+) to Gla proteins, which is often necessary for their conformation, and always necessary for their function.

== Role in coagulation ==
γ-Carboxyglutamic acid residues play an important role in coagulation. The high-affinity calcium binding sites in the GLA domain of factor IX, which is a serine protease of the coagulation system, were found to partially mediate the binding of factor IXa to platelets and in factor-X activation. In addition, upon mechanical injury to the blood vessel wall, a cell-associated tissue factor becomes exposed and initiates a series of enzymatic reactions localized on a membrane surface generally provided by cells and accumulating platelets. Gla residues partly govern the activation and binding of circulating blood-clotting enzymes and zymogens to this exposed cell membrane surface. Specifically, gla residues are needed in calcium binding and in exposing hydrophobic membrane binding regions to the cell bilayer. Lack of these gla residues results in impaired coagulation or even anticoagulation, which may lead to bleeding diathesis or thrombosis. In addition, removal of calcium ion from these proteins with an organic chelator, such as citrate ion, causes their dysfunction, and prevents blood from coagulating. Thus, citrate addition to blood is the most common method of storing it in a liquid state between harvest and transfusion.

<text>William Lee Plunket, 5th Baron Plunket (19 December 1864 – 24 January 1920) was a British diplomat and administrator. He was Governor of New Zealand from 1904 to 1910.

==Early life==
Born in Dublin, he was educated at Harrow and Trinity College Dublin. His parents were William, 4th Lord Plunket, the archbishop of Dublin in 1884–97, and his wife Anne, the daughter of Sir Benjamin Guinness.

He entered the Diplomatic Service and was sent to Rome in 1889 as an attaché to the British Embassy there. In 1892, he was appointed in the same position to the embassy in Constantinople, and finally retired two years later.

==Career==
Having succeeded his father as fifth Baron Plunket in 1897, Plunket three years later became private secretary to Lord Cadogan, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time, and fulfilled the same role for his successor Lord Dudley, when he was appointed to the position in August 1902. He was appointed CVO and KCVO in 1900 and 1903 respectively, and in 1904 he became Governor of New Zealand as well as a KCMG the following year. By chance, the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives at the time was his second cousin Arthur Guinness. He held this post until 1910, when he was advanced to GCMG. In 1907 he presented the Plunket Shield, which is still contested each year by the major cricket teams in New Zealand. He was later appointed KBE in 1918.

==Freemasonry==
He was a Freemason. During his term as Governor of New Zealand (1906–1909), he was also Grand Master of New Zealand&#x27;s Grand Lodge.

==Death==
Lord Plunket died on 24 January 1920 aged 55 at 40 Elvaston Place, London, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Putney Vale Cemetery.

==Family==
Plunket married, in 1894, Lady Victoria Alexandrina Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, youngest daughter of the 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, by whom he was to have eight children. Victoria gave her name to the Plunket Society, a New Zealand society promoting the health and well-being of mothers and children and was a patron of the Mothercraft Training Society.

<text>Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild (29 April 1936 – 26 February 2024), was a British peer, investment banker and member of the Rothschild banking family. Rothschild held important roles in business and British public life, and was active in charitable and philanthropic areas.

He was the eldest son of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild. Raised in a background that intertwined Jewish heritage with the tenets of Orthodox Judaism through his mother&#x27;s conversion, Rothschild&#x27;s education spanned from Eton College to Christ Church, Oxford, where he performed well in history. His early life was marked by membership of the Bullingdon Club and familial connections, including half-siblings Emma Rothschild and Amschel Rothschild.

Rothschild&#x27;s business career started at N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, though a familial dispute led to his departure in 1980. Despite relinquishing his stake in the family bank, he maintained influence through the Rothschild Investment Trust, now RIT Capital Partners plc, among other ventures. Notable business activities included founding J. Rothschild Assurance Group with Mark Weinberg and participating in high-profile bids and partnerships. His tenure as Deputy Chairman of BSkyB Television and involvement with RHJ International and Blackstone Inc. highlighted Rothschild&#x27;s diverse business interests, leading to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order honour in 2020, for services to the Duchy of Cornwall.

Rothschild was married to Serena Mary Dunn, with whom he had four children, continuing the Rothschild legacy. His philanthropic efforts were extensive, chairing and contributing to art and heritage organizations, notably the National Gallery and the Heritage Lottery Fund in the UK. Rothschild&#x27;s participation in restoring Waddesdon Manor and engagement with the Butrint Foundation in Albania showed his interest to cultural preservation. His chairmanship of Yad Hanadiv reflected his commitment to philanthropy in Israel. Under his leadership, the organization went beyond funding national landmarks and began to focus on education initiatives, environmental pursuits and advancing equal opportunity for Israel&#x27;s Arab minority.

==Early life and education==
Born at Merton Hall in Cambridge on 29 April 1936, Nathaniel Charles Jacob Rothschild was the eldest son of Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild, by his first wife Barbara Judith Rothschild (née Hutchinson). His father was born into a Jewish family, while his mother converted to Orthodox Judaism when they married. Rothschild was educated at Eton College and then at Christ Church, Oxford, where he gained a First in history, tutored by Hugh Trevor-Roper. At Oxford he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. Emma Rothschild is his half-sister and Amschel Rothschild was his half-brother.

==Business career==
From 1963, Rothschild worked at the family bank N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in London, before resigning in 1980 due to a family dispute. The chairmanship of the bank had passed from his father, who had chosen to follow a scientific career and had lost control of the majority voting shares, to his distant cousin Sir Evelyn de Rothschild. He sold his minority stake in the bank, but took independent control of Rothschild Investment Trust (now RIT Capital Partners plc), an investment trust listed on the London Stock Exchange.

After resigning from the bank in 1980, Rothschild went on to found J. Rothschild Assurance Group (now St. James&#x27;s Place plc) with Mark Weinberg in 1991. In 1989, he joined forces with Sir James Goldsmith and Kerry Packer in an unsuccessful bid for British American Tobacco.

Rothschild was Chairman of RIT Capital Partners plc, one of the largest investment trusts quoted on the London Stock Exchange with a net asset value of about £2 billion. He was Chairman of J Rothschild Capital Management, a subsidiary of RIT Capital Partners plc. He also retained many other venture capital and property interests.

From November 2003 until his retirement in 2008, he was Deputy Chairman of BSkyB Television and until 2008 he was a Director of RHJ International. He was also a Member of the council for the Duchy of Cornwall for the Prince of Wales and a member of the International Advisory Board of The Blackstone Group.

Rothschild was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to the Duchy of Cornwall.

===Oil interests===
In 2003, it was reported that Russian oil industrialist Mikhail Khodorkovsky&#x27;s shares in YUKOS passed to him under a deal which they had concluded prior to Khodorkovsky&#x27;s arrest.

In November 2010, an entity affiliated with Rothschild purchased a 5% equity interest in Genie Energy, a subsidiary of IDT Corporation, for $10 million. In 2013, Israel granted Genie Energy exclusive oil and gas exploration rights to a 153-square mile (396 km2) area in the southern part of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

==Personal life==
Rothschild was a member of the Reform Jewish synagogue.

In 1961, Rothschild married Serena Mary Dunn, a granddaughter of the Canadian financier Sir James Dunn, and they had four children, consisting of three daughters and one son. Lady Rothschild died in 2019. Their four children are: 
* The Hon. Hannah Mary Rothschild Brookfield (22 May 1962). She married William Brookfield in 1994 and they were divorced. They have three daughters.
* The Hon. Beth Matilda Rothschild Tomassini (27 February 1964). She married Antonio Tomassini in 1991 and they were divorced. They have three children.
* The Hon. Emily Magda Rothschild Freeman-Attwood (19 December 1967). She married Julian Freeman-Attwood on 25 June 1998. They have two daughters.
* Nathaniel Philip Victor James Rothschild, 5th Baron Rothschild (12 July 1971). He married Annabelle Neilson on 13 November 1995, and they were divorced in 1997. He married Loretta Basey in 2016.

Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, died in London, United Kingdom, on 26 February 2024, at the age of 87. The Service of Celebration for the Life of the late Lord Rothschild was held at Waddesdon Manor on 13 June, which was attended by King Charles III and Queen Camilla. 

==Philanthropy==
Jacob Rothschild played a prominent part in Arts philanthropy in Britain. He was Chairman of Trustees of the National Gallery from 1985 to 1991, and from 1992 to 1998, chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund. In the 1990s, he was chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, responsible for distributing the proceeds of the National Lottery to the heritage sector, an influential post which oversaw the distribution of £1.2 billion in grants.

At one time he was also a Trustee of the State Hermitage Museum of St Petersburg (retired 2008); a Trustee of the Qatar Museums Authority (retired 2010); Chairman of the Pritzker Prize for Architecture (2002–2004); Chairman of both the Gilbert Collection Trust and the Hermitage Development Trust, Somerset House; a Trustee and Honorary Fellow of the Courtauld Institute, Somerset House; and a Fellow, Benefactor, and member of the Visitors&#x27; Committees of the Ashmolean Museum Oxford (retired 2008). In 2014, he received the J. Paul Getty Medal &quot;for extraordinary achievement in the fields of museology, art historical research, philanthropy, conservation and conservation science&quot;.
Rothschild was especially active in the project to restore Somerset House in London, for which he helped secure the Gilbert Collection and ensured the long-term future of the Courtauld Institute of Art. As a private project, he carried out the restoration of Spencer House, one of the finest surviving 18th century London townhouses, adjacent to his own offices.

In 1993 he joined with John Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Preston Candover, to set up the Butrint Foundation to record and conserve the archaeological site of Butrint in Albania, close to his holiday home on Corfu. Rothschild remained Chairman of the Butrint Foundation up until his death.

Jacob Rothschild also followed the Rothschild family&#x27;s charitable interests in Israel and was the chairman of Yad Hanadiv, the family foundation which gave the Knesset and the Supreme Court buildings to Israel between 1989 and 2018. Under his leadership, the organization went beyond funding national landmarks and began to focus on education initiatives, environmental pursuits and advancing equal opportunity for Israel&#x27;s Arab minority. He was also president of The Rothschild Foundation (Hanadiv) Europe, and patron and chairman of the board of trustees of The Rothschild Foundation. In addition, he was the Honorary President of the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.

Rothschild served as a Member of the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Board, set up by the British government, is an honorary fellow of the British Academy, and a Trustee of The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Charitable Fund.

Rothschild had also been a Member of the UK Main Honours Board (retired 2008); Chairman of the Honours Committee for Arts and Media (retired 2008); Trustee of the Edmond J Safra Foundation (retired 2010); and a Member of committee of the Henry J Kravis Prize for Creative Philanthropy (retired 2010).

===Waddesdon Manor===
In 1988 he inherited from his aunt Dorothy de Rothschild, the Waddesdon and Eythrope estates in Buckinghamshire, and began a close association with Waddesdon Manor, the house and grounds which were built by Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild in the 1880s and bequeathed to the National Trust in 1957 by his distant cousin, James A. de Rothschild. He was a major benefactor of the restoration of Waddesdon Manor through a private family charitable trust and, in an unusual arrangement, had been given authority by the National Trust to run Waddesdon Manor as a semi-independent operation. The cellars at Waddesdon Manor house his personal collection of 15,000 bottles of Rothschild wines dating as far back as 1870.

Open to the public, Waddesdon attracted over 466,000 visitors in 2018, with 157,000 visiting the house in 2015. Waddesdon has won many awards over the last 20 years, including Visit England&#x27;s &quot;Large Visitor Attraction of the Year&quot; category in 2017, Museum of the Year Award and Best National Trust Property.

Rothschild commissioned the 2015 RIBA Award winner Flint House on the Waddesdon Manor estate in Buckinghamshire. Rothschild donated the property to the Rothschild Foundation which manages the rest of the estate for the National Trust.

The estate has been a venue for visiting heads of state including U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Margaret Thatcher received French president François Mitterrand there at a summit in 1990. It hosted the European Economic Round Table conference in 2002, organised by Warren Buffett and attended by James Wolfensohn, former president of the World Bank, and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

<doc id="953513" wikidata="Q2095882" url="?curid=953513" title="Pinklao">
<text>Pinklao (; 4 September 1808 – 7 January 1866) was the viceroy of Siam. He was the younger brother of Mongkut, King Rama IV, who crowned him as a monarch with equal honor to himself.

==Early life==
Prince Chutamani was born on 4 September 1808, as a son of Prince Itsarasunthon and Princess Bunrot at the Phra Racha Wang Derm or Thonburi Palace. Prince Chutamani also had an elder brother—Prince Mongkut—who was seven years older. In 1809, Prince Itsarasunthon was crowned as Rama II and his mother became Queen Sri Suriyendra. They all moved to the Grand Palace.

The government of Rama II, however, was dominated by &quot;Kromma Meun&quot; Chetsadabodin, his son with Sri Sulalai. In 1824, Mongkut became a monk according to Thai traditions. However, Rama II fell ill and died in the same year. The nobility, led by &quot;Chao Phraya&quot; Abhay Pudhorn, the Prime Minister, and Prayurawongse, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, supported Chetsadabodin for the throne as he proved competent to rule. Chetsadabodin was crowned as Rama III.

Prince Mongkut then stayed in his monkhood to avoid political intrigues. Prince Chutamani, however, entered the government under Nangklao and was awarded the title &quot;Kromma Khun Isaret-rangsant&quot;. &quot;Kromma Khun&quot; Isaret moved to the Thonburi Palace, where he lived with his mother Queen Sri Suriyendra until her death in 1836.

The young prince was, as was his elder brother, well disposed towards foreigners. In 1833 at age 25 and known to diplomatist Edmund Roberts as Chow-Phoi-Noi or &quot;Mom-fa-Noi&quot;, the prince secretly visited the mission house during Roberts&#x27; negotiations for the Siamese–American Treaty of Amity and Commerce, the United States&#x27; first treaty with Thailand. The prince was pleased and gratified with a nighttime visit to the man-of-war &quot;Peacock&quot;, during which the men mustered to quarters for naval exercises. Roberts stated that the prince spoke and wrote the English language with considerable fluency, and his pronunciation was correct.

==Reign with Mongkut==

Nangklao died in 1851. &quot;Kromma Khun&quot; Isaret was at the time the heir presumptive to the throne, but the return and claim of his brother Prince Mongkut was stronger. Mongkut was then crowned on 25 May 1851, with the support of the nobility. Concurrently Prince Isaret was crowned as &quot;Uparaja&quot; Pinklao with equal honor to Mongkut. In practice, Pinklao held the title of Lord of the Front Palace. The popular legend holds that Mongkut&#x27;s own astrological calculations stated that his brother Prince Isaret also held the &quot;fate to become a king&quot;. As a result, he gave Pinklao the same styles and title normally reserved for a King such as &quot;Phrabat Somdet&quot; and &quot;Chao Yu Hua&quot;: &quot;Phrabat Somdet Phra Pinklao Chao Yu Hua&quot;. David Wyatt considers his appointment a way of Mongkut&#x27;s to prevent Pinklao from challenging his own position. Nevertheless, the relationship between the brothers remained peaceful and good throughout Mongkut&#x27;s reign.

The government under Mongkut was, however, in the strong hands of Prayurawongse and Pichaiyat, the former as Chief Minister of Siam. Interference from both King and Vice King was therefore minimal. Expanding his interests to foreign affairs Pinklao, who was known for his fluency in the English language was able to respond to the letters of John Bowring. In the letters, he referred himself as &quot;the Second king&quot; and his brother as &quot;the First king&quot;. As a result, Pinklao was able to play a great role in the negotiation of the Bowring Treaty of 1855, as well as a role in the subsequent negotiation of the Harris Treaty of 1856 that updated the Roberts treaty of 1833.

As the second monarch and Front Palace lord, Pinklao maintained his own private army, and a navy of several modern ships. It was during this time that the power of the Front Palace greatly expanded. Apart from state affairs, Pinklao was interested in both western and Lao culture, speaking English, drilling his troops in European fashion, singing, dancing, and playing the &quot;khene&quot; to &quot;mor lam&quot; music.

Pinklao died on 7 January 1866, predeceasing his brother by two years. His nephew the 15-year-old Chulalongkorn (son of Mongkut), succeeded to the throne in 1868 and Regent Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse arranged the title of Front Palace lord to be succeeded by Pinklao&#x27;s son with Princess Aim, Prince Yingyot, later Wichaichan.

<text>Ernest James Watts (born October 23, 1945) is a Grammy-winning American jazz and R&amp;B saxophonist who plays soprano, alto, and tenor saxophone. He has worked with Charlie Haden&#x27;s Quartet West and toured with the Rolling Stones. On Frank Zappa&#x27;s album &quot;The Grand Wazoo&quot; he played the &quot;Mystery Horn&quot;, a straight-necked C melody saxophone. Watts also played the notable sax riff on &quot;The One You Love&quot; from Glenn Frey&#x27;s album &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot;.

==Biography==

Watts was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and began playing saxophone at 13. After a brief period at West Chester University, he attended the Berklee College of Music on a &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine scholarship.He toured with Buddy Rich in the late 1960s, occupying one of the alto saxophone chairs, and visited Africa on a U.S. State Department tour with Oliver Nelson&#x27;s group.

Watts played alto saxophone with The Tonight Show Band under Doc Severinsen for 20 years and was a member of Barry White&#x27;s Love Unlimited Orchestra. He was a featured soloist on many of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s albums on Motown during the 1970s, as well as on many other pop and R&amp;B sessions during his 25 years as a studio musician in Los Angeles. He has won two Grammy Awards as an instrumentalist.

Watts was added to the lineup of backing musicians on the fifth show of the Rolling Stones American Tour 1981 and was with them until the end of that tour. Throughout the tour, Watts&#x27;s influence on the Stones&#x27; live performance grew significantly, with the Stones jamming longer and longer over tracks such as &quot;Just My Imagination&quot; and Let Me Go&quot;. Watts can be heard on &quot;Still Life&quot;, the live album recorded during the tour. 

In the mid 1980s, Watts decided to rededicate himself to jazz. He recorded and toured with German guitarist and composer Torsten de Winkel, drummer Steve Smith, and keyboardist Tom Coster. He was invited to join Charlie Haden&#x27;s Quartet West; the two met backstage one night after Haden heard Watts play &quot;Nightbird&quot; by Michel Colombier.

Watts also played on soundtracks for the movies &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; and on the theme song for the TV show &quot;Night Court&quot;. In 1982, his version of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; was featured in the Season 4 episode of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; (&quot;The Creation of Venus&quot;). He was featured on one of Windows XP&#x27;s sample tracks,&quot;Highway Blues&quot; by New Stories.
In 1986, Watts visited South America with the Pat Metheny Special Quartet alongside Charlie Haden and Paul Wertico, playing at Shams in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In 2008, his album &quot;Analog Man&quot; won the Independent Music Award for Best Jazz Album. He played on Kurt Elling&#x27;s album &quot;Dedicated to You&quot;, which won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album in 2011.

<text>GiNaC is a free computer algebra system released under the GNU General Public License. The name is a recursive acronym for &quot;GiNaC is Not a CAS&quot; (Computer Algebra System). This is similar to the GNU acronym &quot;GNU&#x27;s not Unix&quot;.

What distinguishes GiNaC from most other computer algebra systems is that it does not provide a high-level interface for user interaction. Rather, it encourages its users to write symbolic algorithms directly in C++, which is GiNaC&#x27;s implementation programming language. The algebraic syntax is achieved in C++ through the use of operator overloading. The name GiNaC is also explained by its developers&#x27; perception that most &quot;computer algebra systems&quot; put too much emphasis on a high-level interface and too little on interoperability.

GiNaC uses the CLN library for implementing arbitrary-precision arithmetic. Symbolically, it can do multivariate polynomial arithmetic, factor polynomials, compute GCDs, expand series, and compute with matrices. It is equipped to handle certain noncommutative algebras which are extensively used in theoretical high energy physics: Clifford algebras, SU(3) Lie algebras, and Lorentz tensors. Due to this, it is extensively used in dimensional regularization computations – but it is not restricted to physics.

GiNaC is the symbolic foundation in several open-source projects: there is a symbolic extension for GNU Octave, a simulator for magnetic resonance imaging, and since May 2009, Pynac, a fork of GiNaC, provides the backend for symbolic expressions in SageMath.

<text>Interstate H-201 (H-201, named the Moanalua Freeway) is the only auxiliary Interstate Highway located outside the contiguous United States, serving the island of Oʻahu in the US state of Hawaii. The loop route connects exits 13 and 19 on H-1, passing Fort Shafter, Tripler Army Medical Center, and the Red Hill Underground Fuel Storage Facility.

Despite being designated an Interstate in 1989, until mid-2004, the route was an unsigned Interstate, signed only as Route 78. The section of the Moanalua Freeway between Route 99 (Kamehameha Highway) and the western H-1 interchange remains designated as Route 78.

==Route description==

H-201 serves as an alternate route to H-1 near Downtown Honolulu, traveling on the Moanalua Freeway around the northeast side of Salt Lake. It begins at a junction with Route 99 on the north side of Aloha Stadium, located near Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam. The freeway travels east through an interchange with H-1, which continues west toward Kapolei and south to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, and H-3. H-201 and H-3 briefly run parallel to each other through Halawa, where the former intersects Kahuapaani Street, before H-3 splits to continue northeast across the Koʻolau Range. H-201 turns southeast to avoid Red Hill and travels through Moanalua, a residential neighborhood with hospitals operated by Kaiser Permanente, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and the US Army (including Tripler Army Medical Center). The freeway continues southeast, passing Moanalua Gardens and an industrial area, before it bisects Fort Shafter, a military installation in the Kalihi valley. H-201 then terminates on the south side of Fort Shafter at an interchange with H-1, which continues southeast towards Downtown Honolulu on the Lunalilo Freeway.

The freeway is maintained by the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) and is designated as part of the National Highway System, a network of strategic highways in the US. H-201 is generally six to eight lanes wide with an eastbound high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane during the morning rush hour from Halawa to Puuloa Road. Traffic volumes on the highway, measured in terms of annual average daily traffic, ranged in 2020 from a minimum of 19,800 vehicles at its western terminus to a maximum of 136,100 vehicles near H-3.

==History==
Moanalua Road, the direct predecessor to H-201, was an unpaved road constructed in the late 19th century to connect Honolulu&#x27;s King Street to Aiea. The road was macadamized in 1899 but remained in poor condition for several years, prompting calls to prioritize its improvement for tourists. It was repaired in the 1910s, following the establishment of Fort Shafter, and plans were announced to straighten sections of the road in 1921.

The territorial government began preliminary construction of a four-lane divided highway to replace Moanalua Road in 1948, following the opening of the new Tripler Army Hospital. The project, which would reduce the number of curves on the road from 24 to 6, was also meant to connect with the Mauka Arterial (now part of H-1) and relieve congestion on the Kamehameha Highway near Pearl Harbor. The westernmost of the divided highway was dedicated and opened to traffic on April 28, 1954. The road was designated as part of Route 72 in 1955.

The remaining section of the original Moanalua Road, bisecting Fort Shafter, was upgraded to a divided highway in the second phase and end at an interchange with the Lunalilo Freeway (also part of H-1). With funding from the territorial highway department and approval of the US Army, several facilities at Fort Shafter were relocated to new buildings in 1958 and the former Tripler Army Hospital was demolished in May 1959 to make way for the project. Construction began in June 1959 under a $1.46-million (equivalent to $ in ) contract awarded to Hawaiian Dredging and Construction. The widened Fort Shafter section of the Moanalua Highway was opened in September 1960, featuring an interchange at E Street and several overpasses.

Plans to upgrade the western terminus at Aiea to an interchange with the Kamehameha Highway were approved in the late 1950s. Construction began in 1960, and the Aiea interchange opened in stages between June 1965 and November 1965, at a cost of $2 million (equivalent to $ in ). A western extension of the Moanalua Highway from the Aiea interchange with flyover ramps to connect to the Kamehameha Highway was approved for construction in 1964 and was opened to traffic in June 1966. The interchange with the Lunalilo Freeway at the eastern end of the highway was completed in May 1964.

The conversion of the highway to a full freeway began in September 1971 with work near Red Hill and was completed in August 1974. It was estimated to cost $37 million (equivalent to $ in ) total to construct. An eastbound lane between Halawa and Puuloa Road was designated for carpools of four or more people in October 1974. The highway was designated as Route 78 in the early 1970s.

The Federal Highway Administration approved the addition of H-201 to the Interstate Highway System on November 1, 1989. HDOT requested that the Moanalua Freeway be reclassified as an Interstate so that the interchange with H-1 at the eastern end could conform to federal highway standards. HDOT originally asked the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in June 1990 to approve the freeway as H-1A in an application to AASHTO&#x27;s Special Committee on US Route Numbering, the committee which approves Interstate Highway designations. HDOT resubmitted a request later that year to number it as H-101, and AASHTO approved it as H-201 on December 8, 1990. The highway was initially designated H-1A, but AASHTO policy does not generally allow alphabetic suffixes in Interstate numbers. The final designation, H-201, conforms to the general rule for three-digit Interstate loop routes that uses an even initial digit.

Until 2004, HDOT chose not to sign H-201 as such, instead retaining the designation Route 78. Reasons given included the following:
* inability to render the new route number in a legible manner (because it has four characters, longer than the one to three characters of any other Interstate, it is necessary to use the thinnest font to render the number, and the shield is wider than the standard Interstate shield)
* encouraging motorists to use the newer and better designed H-1
* avoiding confusion with H-2

In July 2004, in conjunction with a major resurfacing of both sides of the freeway, it was decided to bring the signage in line with the official designation.

<text>William Conyngham Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket (26 August 1828 – 1 April 1897) was Dean of Christ Church Cathedral and Archbishop of Dublin in the Church of Ireland.

== Life ==
Born in Dublin, he was the eldest son of John Plunket, 3rd Baron Plunket and Charlotte Bushe. Plunket was educated at Cheltenham College and Trinity College, Dublin (B.A. 1853; M.A. 1864) before being appointed chaplain and private secretary to his uncle, the Bishop of Tuam, in 1857, a post he held for seven years. The following year, he became Rector of Kilmoyan and Cummer in County Galway. In 1864, he returned to Dublin as Treasurer of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, of which he was appointed Precentor in 1869.

In 1876, Lord Plunket (as he became on succeeding his father in 1871) was consecrated Bishop of Meath, and in 1884 he was finally appointed Archbishop of Dublin, an office he held until his death. In 1871 he inherited Old Connaught and decided to move into the house and surrounding property as he had spent a lot of time there with his grandfather. He was Dean of Christ Church Cathedral from 1884 until 1887 (when he was succeeded by his brother-in-law&#x27;s nephew William Greene). Plunket received an honorary degree from Cambridge University in 1888. He also served as a Commissioner of Education from 1895 onwards and was a senator of the Royal University of Ireland.

He was instrumental in developing the Kildare Place Schools (the Church of Ireland teacher training college), and he was an advocate and supporter of the reformed faith in Spain, Portugal and Italy.

== Family ==
In 1863 he married Anne Lee Guinness, daughter of Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness. Their son William was to have a successful career in government administration. Another son, Benjamin, served as Bishop of Meath and was the father of Olive, Countess Fitzwilliam. His sister married John Darley, bishop of Kilmore, Elphin, and Ardagh. His wife having predeceased him in 1889, Lord Plunket died aged 68 in Dublin, and he was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. His statue near Leinster House in Kildare Street, Dublin is a landmark.

<text>Ronald Gow (1 November 1897 – 27 April 1993) was an English dramatist, best known for &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; (1934).

Born in Heaton Moor, Stockport, Cheshire, the son of a bank manager, Gow attended Altrincham County High School. After training as a chemist, he returned to his old school as a teacher. In the late 1920s he made several educational silent films with his pupils: &quot;The People of the Axe&quot; (1926) and &quot;The People of the Lake&quot; (1928) recreated life in ancient Britain, the latter produced &#x27;with the approval of&#x27; Sir William Boyd Dawkins; &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; (1928) was a Boy Scout adventure with a cameo from Robert Baden-Powell; &quot;The Glittering Sword&quot; (1929) was a medieval parable about disarmament.

Writing occupied his spare time during his years as a schoolmaster, and he wrote several plays for the BBC. At the age of 35 he had his first professional production, in London and New York, with &quot;Gallows Glorious&quot; (1933), a play about the American slavery abolitionist John Brown.

In 1934 he wrote &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;, based on Walter Greenwood&#x27;s novel about unemployment in Salford during the Great Depression. The play was a huge success. Wendy Hiller played the lead, and also made her first film appearance in the Gow-scripted &quot;Lancashire Luck&quot;.

In 1937 Hiller and Gow married. They later moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where they raised two children, Ann (1939–2006) and Anthony (b. 1942). He lived with Hiller at their home, &quot;Spindles&quot;, until his death in 1993. He continued writing plays into his eighties, providing material for his wife in adaptations of &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1946), which was a great success while &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; (1949), adapted from the H. G. Wells novel, quickly proved a commercial failure. Gow was co-credited for the book used in the musical version of &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; which premiered in 1969. His other adaptations include Vita Sackville-West&#x27;s &quot;The Edwardians&quot; and &quot;A Boston Story&quot; (1966), based on Henry James&#x27; &quot;Watch and Ward&quot;.

<text>iShell is a traditional multimedia authoring environment, similar in many ways to Macromedia Director. A descendant of the Apple Media Tool, iShell is designed to be easy to use, but powerful enough to grow as a user&#x27;s skill set increases. iShell was first released by Tribeworks in 1999. In July 2006, tribalmedia acquired all rights to iShell. The current version of iShell is 4.5r7.

iShell uses the Key programming language, which is based on Eiffel. This language was previously known as the Apple Media Language (AML) which was part of the Apple Media Tool. Both iShell and the Apple Media Tool were developed by Patrick Soquet, one of the founders of Tribeworks. The two tools share many design features in common.

iShell differs in its distribution model from similar applications, allowing users access to the source code.

==Features==
* Cross-platform creation and delivery (Macintosh and Windows)
* Graphical reusable object and event based programming and design environment
* Support and use of the QuickTime media framework
* Text support via basic RTF and HTML, and common styled input fields
* Pluggable architecture for the addition of external third-party plugins and scripts
* Access local and remote media assets
* XML creation and parsing through DOM and SAX
* Flat file text database support
* Common programming functions and logic for strings, numbers, etc. without the need for scripting

==Third-party plugins==
Numerous developers have taken advantage of iShell&#x27;s community-source model to build commercial plugins for the software. tribalmedia acts as a reseller for many of these third-party developers.
*Kromo: Adds several features to iShell, including database integration and filesystem functions.
*Spunk: A companion program to Kromo, allows developer to incorporate web-based content into iShell projects.
*ImageLayer: Full integration of Photoshop files.
*ZebraSpeak: Adds text-to-speech and advanced keyboard interaction to iShell.
*ZebraTools: Adds numerous new features to iShell.
*OpenTribe plugins: iSQUALE, DiSx, iStorm, iGDIP, iDream

<text>Inti-Illimani (; from &quot;Inti&quot; and &quot;Illimani)&quot; are an instrumental and vocal Latin American folk music ensemble from Chile. The band was formed in 1967 by a group of university students and it acquired widespread popularity in Chile for their song &quot;Venceremos&quot; (We shall win!), which became the anthem of the Popular Unity government of Salvador Allende. When the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état took place, they were on tour in Europe and were unable to return to their country where their music was proscribed by the ruling military junta of Augusto Pinochet. In Europe their music took on a multifarious character, incorporating elements of European baroque and other traditional music forms to their Latin American rhythms, creating a fusion of modern world music. Their name means &#x27;Sun of the Golden Eagle&#x27; in Aymara.

==History==
The group was formed by students at the Universidad Técnica del Estado at Santiago, Chile in 1967. In 1973 while they were on tour abroad, General Augusto Pinochet launched a coup d&#x27;état and took power. Having heard of the numerous extra-judicial killings of many fellow artists by Chile&#x27;s army, they took up residence in Italy, resulting in &quot;the longest tour in history&quot; as they remained in exile. They continued their efforts supporting Chilean democracy internationally; &quot;magnitizdat&quot; copies of their work continued to be widely distributed in Chile. In September 1988, days after they were no longer banned from Chile, they began touring Chile again, supporting the &quot;No&quot; side during the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite.

In the past the group was musically led by Horacio Salinas and politically led by Jorge Coulon. However, in 2001 there was a controversial split of the group, which started when three key members left the group (José Seves, Horacio Durán and Horacio Salinas). They were replaced by Manuel Meriño (from Entrama), Cristián González and Juan Flores. Due to the importance of departed members, many called into question the ability of the remainder to carry on the Inti-Illimani name. Meanwhile, the three departed members started their own group they call Inti-Illimani Histórico. From 2005 onwards, there has been two groups.

<text>Tanit or Tinnit (Punic: 𐤕𐤍𐤕 &quot;Tīnnīt&quot;) was a chief deity of Ancient Carthage; she derives from a local Berber deity and the consort of Baal Hammon. As Ammon is a local Libyan deity, so is Tannit, who represents the matriarchal aspect of Numidian society, whom the Egyptians identify as Neith and the Greeks identify as Athena. She was the goddess of wisdom, civilization and the crafts; she is the defender of towns and homes where she is worshipped. Ancient North Africans used to put her sign on tombstones and homes to ask for protection her main temples in Thinissut (Bir Bouregba, Tunisia), Cirta (Constantine, Algeria), Lambaesis (Batna, Algeria) and Theveste (Tebessa, Algeria). She had a yearly festival in Antiquity which persists to this day in many parts of North Africa but was banned by Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, who called it a pagan festival.

Tannit was also a goddess of rain, in modern-day Tunisia, it is customary to invoke or (&#x27;Mother Tannou&#x27; or &#x27;Mother Tangou&#x27;, depending on the region), in years of drought to bring rain Similarly, Algerians and Tunisians refer to &quot; farming&quot; to mean non-irrigated agriculture.

== Etymology ==
The names themselves, Baal Hammon and Tanit, have Berber (Tamazight) linguistic structure. Many feminine names begin and end with &quot;t&quot; and &quot;n&quot; in the Berber languages; in berber &quot;Tanit&quot; means spring or stream, though it does not appear in local theophorous names. Before 1955, the only attestations of the goddess&#x27;s name were in Punic, which is written without vowels as &quot;TNT&quot; Tanit or &quot;TNNT&quot; as Tannit and was arbitrarily vocalized as &quot;Tanit&quot;. In 1955, Punic inscriptions transliterated in Greek characters found at El-Hofra (near Constantine, Algeria) transliterated the name as (Thinith) and (Thenneith). The inscriptions indicate that the name was likely pronounced as Tinnīt. Still, many scholars and writers continue to use &quot;Tanit&quot;. She was later worshipped in Roman Carthage in her Romanized form as Dea Caelestis, Juno Caelestis, or simply Caelestis.

== Worship ==
Tanit was worshiped in Punic contexts in the Western Mediterranean, in North Africa, Sicily, Malta, Gades and many other places into Hellenistic times when Rome expanded into North Africa. long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit was still venerated in North Africa under the , for her identification with Juno by the Romans.Tanit&#x27;s worship had a massive local cult of origin in north Africa, since in ancient Carthage, Tanit soon eclipsed the more established cult of Baal Hammon and, in the Carthaginian area at least, was frequently listed before him on the monuments From the fifth century BCE onwards, Tanit&#x27;s worship is associated with that of Baal Hammon. She is given the epithet (&#x27;face of Baal&#x27;) and the title , the female form of (&#x27;chief&#x27; or &#x27;lord&#x27;). In North Africa, where the inscriptions and material remains are more plentiful, she was, as well as a consort of Baal Hammon, a heavenly goddess of war, a &quot;virginal&quot; (unmarried) mother goddess and nurse, and, less specifically, a symbol of fertility, as are most female forms. Tanit&#x27;s worship became popular in Carthage, especially after the separation between Carthage and Tyre in the 6th century BCE, when the traditional Phoenician cults of Astarte and Melqart were replaced by the worship of local North African deities Tanit and Baal Hammon.

Several of the major Greek goddesses were identified with Tanit by the syncretic &quot;interpretatio graeca&quot;, which recognized as Greek deities in foreign guise the gods of most of the surrounding non-Hellene cultures as the Greek historians such as Herodotus, Apollodorus, Pausanias mention that Athena has ancient Libyan origins in North Africa to Tanit herself as a goddess of strikingly similar aspects to Athena (Wisdom, War, Weaving..etc). Herodotus one of the most well known Greek historians who traveled throughout the region wrote about her the following:

Archeologists have recently also uncovered temples of Tannit dating back to the 4th century BC in the Azores islands dedicated to Tanit, archaeologists uncovered more than five hypogea type monuments (tombs excavated in rocks) and at least three ‘sanctuaries’ proto-historic, carved into the rock.

A shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia revealed an inscription that has been speculated to have connection between the goddesses Tanit and Astarte (Ishtar). Iconographic portrayals of both deities later become similar thanks to the influence of Carthage&#x27;s trade empire across the mediterranean West to East. The relation between both deities has been proposed to be hypostatic in nature, representing similar aspects of the goddesses. In Carthage, Astarte another war goddess was worshipped alongside the goddess Tanit, the two deities are clearly not equal and one does not originate from the other. Although Tanit did not appear at Carthage before the 5th century BC, this shows her clear origins locally from North Africa. However it is well known that the Phoenician Astarte is a deity of wars of aggression, in direct contrast to Libyan Tanit which only goes to war in the defense of the civilization or the homeland where she is worshipped, called &#x27;defender of homes and families&#x27;, giving direction and help to those who seek wisdom. Carthagenians spread the cult of Tanit-Astarte to the Iberian Peninsula with the foundation of Gadir (modern day Cádiz) and other colonies, where the goddess might have been also assimilated to native deities. Her worship was still active after the Roman conquest, when she was integrated with the Roman goddess Juno (along with elements from Diana and Minerva) in a goddess named &quot;Dea Caelestis&quot;, the same way Baal Hammon was assimilated to Saturn. Dea Caelestis retained Punic traits until the end of classical antiquity in the fourth century CE. Similarly, long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit was still venerated in North Africa under the , for her identification with Juno.

The temple of Juno Caelestis, dedicated to the City Protector Goddess Juno Caelestis, which was the Roman name for Tanit, was one of the biggest building monuments of Roman Carthage, and became a holy site for pilgrims from all North Africa and Spain.

==Iconography==

Her symbol (the sign of Tanit), found on many ancient stone carvings, the symbol of Tannit, is a triangle representing the human body, surmounted by a circle representing the head, and separated by a horizontal line which represents the hands. Later, the trapezium was frequently replaced by an isosceles triangle. The symbol is interpreted by Danish professor of Semitic philology F. O. Hvidberg-Hansen as a woman raising her hands. She is also represented by the crescent moon and the Venus symbol.

Tanit is often depicted while riding a lion or having a lion&#x27;s head herself, showing her warrior quality, and is often naked or bare-breasted, as a symbol of sexuality. She is also depicted winged, possibly under the influence of Egyptian artwork of Isis. Her associated animal and plants are the lion, the dove, the palm tree and the rose. Another motif assimilates her to Europa, portraying Tanit as a woman riding a bull that would represent another deity, possibly El.

== Rituals ==

Berber women&#x27;s ritual in north africa (Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco) evolved around healing fertility worship lamentation and life cycles, for Berber women these rituals are supposed to bring personal and communal satisfaction regarding religious enactment spirituality emotional needs reinforcements of family and social bonds achievements of pedagogical goals, these rituals may be public or privates an example of public rituals is the right of or (bride of the rain). This is one of the oldest rights which seeks rain from the sky when the soil and agriculture are threatened by droughts and scarcity of water. The origin of this right goes back to an ancient tradition of gathering and singing in front of the Goddess Tanit to implore her to bring rain when water is scarce, the performance of this right changes from region to region but the difference is in this respect are small. A procession goes from Village to Village and from one saint&#x27;s sanctuary to another carrying an effigy of a female, on the way the bride is splashed with water from Terraces and windows of houses, people give money gifts to the leader of the procession, the gathered money and food are used to prepare a big meal near a water spring or in a saint&#x27;s sanctuary, usually on top of the hill.

=== Child sacrifice ===

The origins of Tanit are to be found in the pantheon of Ugarit, especially in the Ugaritic goddess Anat (Hvidberg-Hansen 1982). There is significant, albeit disputed, evidence, both archaeological and within ancient written sources, pointing towards child sacrifice forming part of the worship of Tanit and Baal Hammon.

Some archaeologists theorized that infant sacrifices have occurred. Lawrence E. Stager, who directed the excavations of the Carthage Tophet in the 1970s, believes that infant sacrifice was practiced there. Paolo Xella of the National Research Council in Rome summarized the textual, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence for Carthaginian infant sacrifice.

===Archaeological evidence===
 is a Hebrew term from the Bible, used to refer to a site near Jerusalem at which Canaanites and Israelites who strayed from Judaism by practicing Canaanite idolatry were said to sacrifice children. It is now used as a general term for all such sites with cremated human and animal remains. The Hebrew Bible does not specify that the Israelite victims were buried, only burned, although the &quot;place of burning&quot; was probably adjacent to the place of burial. We have no idea how the Phoenicians themselves referred to the places of burning or burial, or to the practice itself.

Several apparent tophets have been identified, chiefly a large one in Carthage, dubbed the Tophet of Salammbó, after the neighbourhood where it was unearthed in 1921. Soil in the Tophet of Salammbó was found to be full of olive wood charcoal, probably from the sacrificial pyres. It was the location of the temple of the goddess Tanit and the necropolis. Animal remains, mostly sheep and goats, found inside some of the Tophet urns, strongly suggest that this was not a burial ground for children who died prematurely. The animals were sacrificed to the gods, presumably in place of children (one surviving inscription refers to the animal as &quot;a substitute&quot;). It is conjectured that the children unlucky enough not to have substitutes were also sacrificed and then buried in the Tophet. The remains include the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who argue in favor of child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed then so too were the children. The area covered by the Tophet in Carthage was probably over an acre and a half by the fourth century BCE, with nine different levels of burials. About 20,000 urns were deposited between 400 BCE and 200 BCE, with the practice continuing until the early years of the Christian era. The urns contained the charred bones of newborns and in some cases the bones of fetuses and two-year-olds. These double remains have been interpreted to mean that in the cases of stillborn babies, the parents would sacrifice their youngest child.

A detailed breakdown of the age of the buried children includes pre-natal individuals – that is, still births. It is also argued that the age distribution of remains at this site is consistent with the burial of children who died of natural causes, shortly before or after birth. Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was &quot;a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were &quot;offered&quot; to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead&quot;. He adds that this was probably part of &quot;an effort to ensure the benevolent protection of the same deities for the survivors.&quot; However, this analysis is disputed; Patricia Smith and colleagues from the Hebrew University and Harvard University show from the teeth and skeletal analysis at the Carthage Tophet that infant ages at death (about two months) do not correlate with the expected ages of natural mortality (perinatal).

==Cultural references==
In Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Salammbô&quot; (1862), the title character is a priestess of Tanit. Mâtho, the chief male protagonist, a Libyan mercenary rebel at war with Carthage, breaks into the goddess&#x27;s temple and steals her veil.

In Kate Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Spiritwalker&quot; trilogy, a romanticised version of Tanit is one of many deities commonly worshiped in a polytheistic Europa. The narrator, Catherine, frequently appeals to &quot;Blessed Tanit, Protector of Women&quot;, and the goddess occasionally appears to her.

G. K. Chesterton refers to Tanit in his account of the Punic Wars, &quot;War of the Gods and Demons&quot; (a chapter of his book &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;). Describing the cultural shock of foreign armies invading Italy when Hannibal crossed the Alps, Chesterton wrote:
In Margaret Atwood&#x27;s &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; there is an epigraph on a Carthaginian funerary urn that reads: &quot;I swam, the sea was boundless, I saw no shore. / Tanit was merciless, my prayers were answered. / O you who drown in love, remember me.&quot;

In John Maddox Roberts&#x27;s alternate history novel &quot;Hannibal&#x27;s Children&quot;, in which the Carthaginians won the Second Punic War, one of the characters is Princess Zarabel, leader of the cult of Tanit.

Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1956 science fiction short story &quot;The Dead Past&quot; tells of Arnold Potterley, a professor of ancient history, who is obsessed with exonerating the Carthaginians of child sacrifice and tries to gain access to the chronoscope, a device which allows direct observation of past events. Eventually, Potterley&#x27;s obsession with the Carthaginian past has far-reaching effects on the society of the present.

==Given name==

<doc id="953587" wikidata="Q4352807" url="?curid=953587" title="Theodore J. Forstmann">
<text>Theodore Joseph Forstmann (February 13, 1940 – November 20, 2011) was one of the founding partners of Forstmann Little &amp; Company, a private equity firm, and chairman and CEO of IMG, a global sports and media company. A billionaire, Forstmann was a Republican and a philanthropist. He supported school choice and funded scholarship programs for the disadvantaged. He led a tour of refugee camps in the former Yugoslavia.

==Early life==
Forstmann was born and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, the second of six children. He was the son of Dorothy (née Mercadante) and Julius Forstmann, who ran a wool business that went bankrupt in 1958. Julius had inherited Forstmann Woolen Co. from his own father, one of the richest American businessmen. Forstmann had German and Italian ancestry. He was a graduate of Greenwich Country Day School and Phillips Academy. He then played goalie on the ice hockey team at Yale University where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Forstmann later attended Columbia Law School where he earned a Juris Doctor, which he financed through gambling proceeds.

==Forstmann Little &amp; Company==
Forstmann, an attorney, founded Forstmann Little in 1978 with his younger brother Nicholas, and Brian Little. Forstmann&#x27;s second brother, J. Anthony Forstmann, founded ForstmannLeff.

Under Forstmann&#x27;s leadership, Forstmann Little &amp; Company made 31 acquisitions and significant investments and returned more than $15 billion of profits to investors. In addition to IMG, some of the firm&#x27;s investments included Gulfstream Aerospace, Dr. Pepper, Topps, Stanadyne Corp., Community Health Systems, Ziff Davis, Yankee Candle, General Instrument Corporation, and most recently, Citadel Broadcasting and 24 Hour Fitness.

==Career==

===Critic of junk bonds===
While playing golf in the late 1980s, Ted Forstmann inadvertently coined the term for which he became best known. His golf partner asked Forstmann what it meant for a company to be taken over by a buyout firm. &quot;It means the barbarians are at the gates,&quot; replied Forstmann. The term became part of Wall Street lore and was connected inseparably to the private equity industry that Forstmann pioneered and flourished in.
Forstmann was featured prominently in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, as he and his company attempted to acquire RJR Nabisco. In the subsequent film adaptation, he was portrayed by actor David Rasche. The book portrayed Forstmann as a critic of KKR&#x27;s Henry Kravis and his investment methods.

Forstmann&#x27;s criticism of Kravis (and much of the rest of the financial industry during the 1980s) centered on the issuance of high yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds to finance mergers and acquisitions. (Forstmann referred to junk bonds as &quot;wampum&quot;.) When the junk bond market later fell into disfavor as a result of scandal, Forstmann&#x27;s criticism was seen as prescient, as his more conventional investment strategy had been able to maintain nearly the same level of profitability as companies such as KKR and Revlon that built their strategy around high-yield debt.

===Credit crisis===
Forstmann accurately predicted the worsening of the credit crisis in July 2008, when most pundits believed the crisis had reached its peak. Forstmann argued that the excess of money pumped into the economy after the September 11 attacks in 2001 distorted the decision-making abilities of nearly everyone in finance. With an oversupply of money, bankers and other financiers took on more risk with less return. While this allowed many to make money for a time, eventually this risk accumulated, and the consequences led to the credit crisis.

==Civic life==
In 1995, Forstmann was given the &quot;Patron of the Arts Award&quot; by the National Academy of Popular Music at the Songwriters Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.

Forstmann dedicated significant personal resources to the cause of education reform. He was a prominent supporter of school choice. In 1998, he and friend John T. Walton established the Children&#x27;s Scholarship Fund to provide tuition assistance for low-income families wanting to send their children to private school.

In February 2011, Forstmann became a signatory of The Giving Pledge.

He was an active member of the Republican Party. He served as co-chairman of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s re-election campaign in the 1992 US presidential election.

==Personal life==
Forstmann never married. He adopted two boys in the 1990s after meeting them at an orphanage in South Africa.

Forstmann dated Padma Lakshmi, the host and judge of &quot;Top Chef&quot;. During a break in their relationship, Lakshmi gave birth to a daughter. Lakshmi was initially unclear as to the father&#x27;s identity, and it was later revealed by DNA testing to be Adam Dell.

In December 2006, newspaper reports on the inquiry into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales alleged that U.S. intelligence agencies had bugged Forstmann&#x27;s phone or plane and monitored his relationship with Diana. She and her sons were said to have planned to visit him in summer 1997, but British security reportedly blocked the visit over security concerns related to the bugging.

In May 2011, Forstmann was diagnosed with brain cancer and received treatment at the Mayo Clinic. He died on November 20, 2011, of complications from brain cancer. He had a net worth of $1.8 billion as of 2011.

<text>Samuel Marvin Griffin, Sr. (September 4, 1907 – June 13, 1982) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Georgia.

A lifelong Democrat, Griffin was a native of Bainbridge, Georgia and publisher of the &quot;Bainbridge Post-Searchlight&quot;. He served as the 72nd governor of Georgia from 1955 to 1959, where he supported educational segregation and opposed the integration of Georgia schools. After the end of his gubernatorial tenure, he returned to his native Bainbridge and entered the real estate business, helping to found Bainbridge College (later Bainbridge State College) in 1970. He served on the college&#x27;s board of directors and died from lung cancer in 1982.

==Early life and education==
Griffin was born in Bainbridge, Georgia and graduated from The Citadel in 1929. At The Citadel, Griffin was a battalion commander and also played on the baseball team. He taught in Virginia for a short time before moving back to Bainbridge.

==Career==

===Georgia General Assembly and cabinet===
In 1934, Griffin, a lifelong Democrat, was elected to the Georgia General Assembly. Two years later, he failed in an attempt to be elected to the United States House of Representatives. After that, he served in the administration of Governor Eurith D. Rivers, rising to the post of executive secretary. He also owned the Bainbridge radio station, WMGR, which was established in the late 1940s. The call sign was for Marvin Griffin Radio.

===Military service===
When the United States entered World War II, Griffin commanded a Georgia National Guard anti-aircraft battery sent to New Guinea. Griffin was a major for most of World War II and was honorably discharged as a lieutenant colonel in 1944. The next day, Governor Ellis Arnall appointed Griffin adjutant general of the Georgia National Guard, where he served until 1947. During his tenure as adjutant general, Griffin was a brigadier general in the Georgia National Guard.

===Lieutenant Governor of Georgia===
Griffin became the first Lieutenant Governor of Georgia to win office in a special election, in 1948. The first person elected as Georgia&#x27;s lieutenant governor was Melvin E. Thompson, who took office in January 1947, but also claimed the office of governor after the death of Governor-elect Eugene Talmadge in December 1946. Griffin was elected to a full term in 1950.

===Governor of Georgia===

====1954 election====

Griffin was seen as the successor to Governor Herman Talmadge, and he won the governorship in 1954 before runoff elections were required in Georgia. Griffin received a plurality of 36.3 percent of the ballots cast. Melvin E. Thompson, Griffin&#x27;s predecessor as lieutenant governor, trailed with 25.1 percent. Another primary candidate was the later Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. As governor, Griffin was a staunch segregationist. He spoke out against the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision and pledged to keep Georgia&#x27;s schools segregated &quot;come hell or high water.&quot;

====Springhill mining disaster====
In 1958, Griffin, who was a segregationist and accused of being racist, took advantage of the intense media coverage surrounding the Springhill mining disaster in Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada to promote tourism to his state by offering a group of survivors free vacations to Jekyll Island. However, to the segregationist governor&#x27;s chagrin, one of the rescued miners was black, resulting in a public relations nightmare.

====1956 Sugar Bowl and rivalry with Blake Van Leer====

Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl, where the Pitt Panthers, including African-American player Bobby Grier, were scheduled to meet the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. There was controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Governor Griffin&#x27;s opposition to integration. Tech president Blake R. Van Leer and coach Dodd met with Governor Marvin Griffin privately who promised to not interfere with the game. However, in December 1955, Griffin publicly sent a telegram to his state&#x27;s Board of Regents in an attempt to pressure Georgia Tech&#x27;s president Blake R. Van Leer to pull out. Griffin implored teams from Georgia not to engage in racially integrated events which had black citizens either as participants or as spectators. Van Leer rejected this request, which was not a stand to serve him well in the 1950s. Van Leer was already catching heat for pushing through a vote to allow women in Georgia Tech. Griffin also sent public telegrams to multiple news publications. Van Leer refused to back down during multiple meetings with the board of regents. In one meeting he would threaten to resign as a show of support when summoned by the board of regents.

He was quoted: Griffin would later request that Van Leer and Georgia Tech&#x27;s players be punished for student riots, followed up with an investigation request. Another state representative John P Drinkard recommended that all of Georgia Tech&#x27;s state funding be cut off if they proceed and later Griffin suggested anyone who adhered to the principles of integration should not be admitted to Tech. Van Leer still stuck to his statements and later received a standing ovation from the faculty senate. Two weeks after the game, Van Leer died of a heart attack on January 24, 1956, at the Atlanta Veterans Hospital.

A large contingent from the New Orleans community, as well as many related to Georgia Tech, openly fought to bar either Grier, Pitt, or the Yellow Jacket team from the game. However, students, football players and Georgia Tech&#x27;s president, civil rights leaders, as well as a large number of the Pitt community, succeeded in ensuring that the game took place.

====Corruption charges====
Griffin&#x27;s term was marred by charges of corruption. Several administration members were found guilty of crimes and Griffin was investigated in 1960 by a grand jury, which returned no true bills.

====1962 election====
In 1962, Griffin ran once more for governor but lost in the primary to a moderate candidate, Carl Sanders. Griffin received 332,746 votes (39 percent) to Sanders&#x27; 494,978 (58.7 percent). Part of the factor in Griffin&#x27;s defeat was the abolishment of the county unit system, though one study found that Sanders would have won even if the county unit system had still been in place. Thereafter, Griffin largely retired from politics. After his loss, Griffin commented, &quot;I retired for reasons of health: the voters were sick and tired of me.&quot;

In the 1966 gubernatorial race, Griffin supported Democratic nominee Lester Maddox, an Atlanta businessman known for his segregationist views. Maddox&#x27;s opponent, Republican U.S. Representative Howard Callaway, had supported Griffin in the latter&#x27;s 1962 campaign. As the publisher of the &quot;Post Searchlight&quot; in Bainbridge, Griffin at first indicated that he would repay Callaway for the earlier support, but he instead held firm for Maddox. &quot;I consider Bo Callaway one of my best friends, but I can&#x27;t go with him in the governor&#x27;s race,&quot; Griffin said. Conversely, former Governor Ernest Vandiver, who as lieutenant governor from 1955 to 1959 had frequently quarreled with Governor Griffin, dismissed Maddox as &quot;a pipsqueak&quot; and endorsed Callaway.

In 1968, Griffin was a stand-in candidate for Vice President of the United States on George C. Wallace&#x27;s American Independent Party ticket. Griffin was thereafter replaced in the second slot by United States Air Force General Curtis LeMay although Griffin&#x27;s name stayed on the ballot in 27 states, mostly concentrated in the Midwest.

==Later life and death==
In 1946, Griffin&#x27;s 14-year-old daughter, Patricia Ann Griffin, died in the Winecoff Hotel fire.

After the end of his gubernatorial tenure, Griffin returned to his hometown of Bainbridge and went into the real estate business. His first wife died in 1970, and Griffin, who was devastated by her death, remarried to Laura Jane Gibson. Griffin and his second wife both led active lives. He helped to found Bainbridge College in 1970, where classes began in 1973. He was a leading advocate and member of the college&#x27;s board of directors. He also oversaw and directed the Decatur County Sesquicentennial in 1973, at which Georgia governor and future President Jimmy Carter was the honored guest. A lifelong smoker, Griffin was diagnosed with lung cancer, the disease which would eventually kill him. He was heartbroken by the death of his second wife who also died from lung cancer. He died on June 13, 1982, less than a week after his wife&#x27;s death.

<doc id="953598" wikidata="Q1688154" url="?curid=953598" title="John Martin (Governor of Kansas)">
<text>John Alexander Martin (March 10, 1839 – October 2, 1889) was the tenth governor of Kansas.

==Origins==
Martin was born in Brownsville, Pennsylvania, a son of James and Jane Montgomery (Crawford) Martin. His father was a native of Maryland, and his mother a native of Pennsylvania. He was of Scots-Irish extraction, and the family was related to General Richard Montgomery. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Brown, was the founder of Brownsville, Pennsylvania. Martin was educated in the public schools and, at the age of fifteen, began learning the printer&#x27;s trade. He spent a brief time in Pittsburgh, where he worked as a compositor in the office of the &quot;Commercial Journal&quot;.

==Freedom&#x27;s Champion==
In 1857, at the age of 18, he came to the Kansas Territory, bought the newspaper known as the &quot;Squatter Sovereign&quot;, published at Atchison, and changed the name to &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Champion&quot;. He continued to publish this paper until his death. He was a firm free-state man and soon became actively identified with the political affairs of the territory. In 1858 he was nominated for the territorial legislature, but declined because he was not yet of legal age. In 1859 he was a delegate to the Osawatomie convention which organized the Republican party in Kansas, and for the remainder of his life he was an unswerving supporter of the principles and policies of that organization. His intelligent activity in political affairs led to his being honored by election or appointment to various positions of trust and responsibility. On July 5, 1859, he was elected secretary of the Wyandotte constitutional convention; was secretary of the railroad convention at Topeka in October, 1860; was a delegate to the Republican national convention of that year, and was elected to the Kansas Senate in 1861.

==Civil War service==
Before the expiration of his term as senator the Civil War broke out, and in October 1861, he was mustered into the United States volunteer service as lieutenant colonel of the 8th Kansas Volunteer Infantry. Early in 1862 he was appointed provost marshal of Leavenworth and held the position until his regiment was ordered to Corinth, Mississippi in March. There the 8th Kansas Infantry became a part of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s army, and it remained in the Army of the Cumberland until the close of the war. On November 1, 1862, Martin was promoted to colonel, and a few weeks later was assigned to duty as provost marshal of Nashville, Tennessee, which position he filled until the following June. With his command he took part in the Battle of Perryville; the various engagements of the Tullahoma Campaign; the battle of Chickamauga, where on the second day he was assigned to the command of the Third Brigade, First Division, XX Corps; and in November was present at the siege of Chattanooga and the Battle of Missionary Ridge. With Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s army he marched to Atlanta in the memorable campaign of 1864, the line of march being marked by engagements at Rocky Face Ridge, Dalton, Resaca, Kingston, Kennesaw Mountain and various other points. After the fall of Atlanta, Martin&#x27;s regiment joined in the pursuit of Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood as he marched northward into Tennessee, where it closed its service. During the closing scenes of his military career Martin commanded the First Brigade, Third Division, IV Corps, until he was mustered out at Pulaski, Tennessee on November 17, 1864. He later received a brevet of brigadier general &quot;for gallant and meritorious services&quot;, dated March 13, 1865.

==After the war==
Returning to Kansas, Martin resumed the editorial management of his paper, and again became a factor in political affairs. He served as a member of the Kansas Senate from 1859 to 1861, and was mayor of Atchison, serving in 1865 and 1878 to 1880. He served as the third Atchison postmaster for twelve years. For twenty-five consecutive years he was chairman of the Atchison County Republican Central Committee; was a member of the Republican National Committee from 1868 to 1884, and secretary of the committee during the last four years of that period; served as a delegate to the first Republican Convention in 1860, and was a member of the 1860, 1868, 1872, and 1880 Republican National Conventions; was a member of one of the vice-presidents of the United States Centennial commission; was one of the founders of the Kansas Historical Society, of which he was president in 1878; was president the same year of the Editors&#x27; and Publishers&#x27; Association; and from 1878 to the time of his death was one of the board of managers of the Leavenworth branch of the National Soldiers&#x27; Home. During all the years following the Civil War he manifested a keen interest in the work and welfare of the Grand Army of the Republic, and when the Department of Kansas was organized, he was honored by being elected its first commander.

==Governor Martin==
For years before his election to the office of Governor, Martin had an ambition to be the chief executive of his adopted state, but knew he had to wait and prepare himself for the duties of the office in case he should be called to fill it. The call came in 1884, when he was nominated and elected. The beginning of his administration was very difficult, and he was besieged by hordes of office-seekers. This, on account of the previous Democratic administration.

At first Martin was not a prohibitionist, but in time, as he saw the beneficial effects of prohibition, he became converted to be one of its most ardent champions. During Martin&#x27;s administration six educational institutions were established in Kansas, and 182 school houses were built in 1887. Also, the State Reformatory was located at Hutchinson, and opportunities for reform were provided for young law-breakers.

In March 1886, a strike and serious disturbances on the Missouri Pacific Railroad, in Missouri and Kansas, demanded Martin&#x27;s attentions. Rioting caused him to send the First Kansas Militia to the scene of action. After being the cause of great inconveniences and suffering, the strike was settled in April.

His first administration commended him to the people, and in 1886 he was reelected.

A bill was passed by the Kansas Legislature of 1887, conferring on women of Kansas the right to vote at school, bond, and municipal elections. This was one of the first steps toward the complete suffrage the State enjoys today.

Kansas had steadily progressed in prosperity and her towns and broad farming lands had increased immensely in value. This led to a &quot;boom&quot; during which cities were erected on paper and real towns increased in size. Many syndicates were organized to deal in Kansas real estate. Long blocks of buildings were erected in unnecessary towns, and the prairie was long after dotted with rusting pipes and hydrants, the only tangible evidences of these useless towns. The end of 1888 saw the great Kansas &quot;boom&quot; collapse, and, as this year had also had a failure of crops, Kansas experienced a panic. But this check in prosperity was comparatively brief.

There was a contest for the county seat between towns in several counties. Bitter rivalries and feuds resulted, the worst being the Stevens County, where several people were killed. On an appeal made to the Governor for help, and a militia regiment was sent to the county. In 1888 Greeley County was organized, thus completing the organization of Kansas&#x27; 105 present counties.

==Marriage and death==
On June 7, 1871, Martin married Ida Challiss, and together they had seven children.

Martin died from pneumonia on October 2, 1889, in Atchison at the age of 50, and was interred in Atchison&#x27;s Mount Vernon Cemetery.

<text>David Robert Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore PC, QC (3 December 1838 – 22 August 1919) was an Irish lawyer and Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
Plunket was the third son of John Plunket, 3rd Baron Plunket, second son of William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. His mother was Charlotte, daughter of Charles Kendal Bushe, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, while the Most Reverend William Plunket, 4th Baron Plunket, Archbishop of Dublin, was his elder brother. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin and was called to the Irish Bar in 1862.

==Political and legal career==
After practising on the Munster Circuit for a number of years, Plunket was made a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1868, and became Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland that same year. In 1870, he was elected Conservative Member of Parliament for Dublin University, and was Solicitor General for Ireland under Benjamin Disraeli from 1875 to 1877. He was then briefly Paymaster General under Disraeli (then known as the Earl of Beaconsfield) in 1880 and was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. In 1885 he became First Commissioner of Works in Lord Salisbury&#x27;s first ministry, a post he held until January 1886. He resumed the same post in August of the same year when the Conservatives returned to power, and held it until 1892. On his retirement from the House of Commons in 1895 he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Rathmore, of Shanganagh in the County of Dublin.

Apart from his political and legal career he was a director of the Suez Canal Company, Chairman of the North London Railway for many years and a director of the Central London Railway at its opening in 1900..

==Personal life==

In Dublin, Rathmore was a member of the Kildare Street Club. He died in August 1919, unmarried, at the age of eighty, in the Railway Hotel in Greenore, County Louth and is buried at Putney Vale Cemetery in London. His peerage became extinct at his death.

<doc id="953652" wikidata="Q11135198" url="?curid=953652" title="History of Jiangxi">
<text>The history of Jiangxi stretches from Lower Paleolithic times to the present, as Jiangxi was already inhabited by humans one million years ago. Until recently, the earliest known Jiangxi pottery was dated to around 11000 BC,; however, recent finds show that the absolutely earliest known pottery, from ca. 18,000 BC, comes from Xianren Cave in Jiangxi. In this Chinese province the full Neolithic period began before 8000 BC, as represented by Xianrendong culture in discovering cultivated rice over 10,000 years ago. This period is followed by the Bronze Age around 2000 BC, represented by Wucheng culture and Dayangzhou culture, and by the Iron Age prior to 500 BC.

The first recorded people inhabited in Jiangxi are Baiyue and their influence is still found in modern-day Gan Chinese dialects. Jiangxi was then respectively ruled by Wu, Yue, Chu in the 1st millennium BC and firstly conquered by the Chinese dynasty of Han around 200 BC.

Centred on the Gan River valley, Jiangxi provides the main north–south transport route. Its encirclement by mountains has allowed the lands of Jiangxi to develop as a separate geographic region and an independent cultural entity. They provide one of the communication routes from the North China Plain and the Yangzi River valley to the territory of modern Guangdong. As a result, Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of its history.

== Early history ==
Jiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the Shang dynasty (16th to 11th centuries). Information about this era is scarce, but it is likely that peoples collectively known as the Yue inhabited the region.

During the Spring and Autumn period, the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of Wu. Two settlements are known of at this time: Ai (), and Po (番, later 潘). After Wu was conquered by the state of Yue (a power based in modern northern Zhejiang) in 473 BC, the state of Chu (based in modern Hubei) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC, and was in turn subjugated by the state of Qin in 221 BC. Qin established the Qin dynasty in that same year, the first unified Chinese state.

== Imperial China ==

The unification of China by the Qin dynasty saw the incorporation of Jiangxi into the Qin empire. The First Emperor of Qin established seven counties in Jiangxi, all of them administered from the commandery seat of Jiujiang, located north of the Yangzi in modern Anhui. All of the commandery seats were located along the Gan River system. Most were no more than a day or two separated and protected one of the Qin routes to the newly incorporated territories further south in Nanhai (modern Guangzhou). Military settlements were known to have existed at least two of the counties. The Qin colonisation formed the earliest settlement structure in Jiangxi and which for the most part, has survived to the present day.

The commandery of Yuzhang () was established in northern Jiangxi at the beginning of the Han dynasty, possibly before the death of Xiang Yu in 202 BC. In 201, eight commanderies were added to the original seven of Qin, and three more were established in later years. For most of the Han era the commandery&#x27;s eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others are located directly on modern municipalities. Others counties, however, have been moved and abolished in later centuries.

In 291 AD, during the Western Jin dynasty, Jiangxi became its own &quot;zhou&quot; called Jiangzhou (). During the Northern and Southern dynasties, Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of &quot;zhou&quot; slowly grew.

During the Sui dynasty, there were seven commanderies and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the Tang dynasty, another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming &quot;zhou&quot; (henceforth translated as &quot;prefectures&quot; rather than &quot;provinces&quot;).

Circuits were established during the Tang dynasty as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the Jiangnan Circuit (lit. &quot;Circuit south of the Yangtze&quot;). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called Jiangnanxi Circuit (lit. &quot;Western circuits south of the Yangtze&quot;). This is the source of the modern name &quot;Jiangxi&quot;.

As a circuit, Jiangnanxi contained eight prefectures (&quot;zhou&quot;):
Six prefectures and four military prefectures (軍 jun) replaced the previous prefectures (with fifty-five counties).

The Tang dynasty collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Jiangxi first belonged to Wu (), then to Southern Tang (). Both states were based in modern-day Nanjing, further down the Yangtze River.

During the Song dynasty, Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).

During the Yuan dynasty, the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern Guangdong. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the Ming dynasty after Guangdong was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.

==Modern time==
After the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the Communists and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people&#x27;s revolution. The Nanchang Uprising took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the Chinese Civil War. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang&#x27;s attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the Communists declared Jiangxi&#x27;s independence from the Republic of China as the &quot;Chinese Soviet Republic&quot; which was formed in Ruijin (), sometimes called the &quot;Former Red Capital&quot; (), or just the &quot;Red Capital&quot;. In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the Long March to Yan&#x27;an.

Following the Doolittle Raid during World War II, most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The Imperial Japanese Army began the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign to intimidate the Chinese from helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians while searching for Doolittle&#x27;s men.

<doc id="953669" wikidata="Q3565555" url="?curid=953669" title="Wally Lewis">
<text>Walter James Lewis AM (born 1 December 1959) is an Australian former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and coached in the 1980s and 1990s. He became a commentator for television coverage of the sport. A highly decorated Australian national captain, Lewis is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever players of rugby league. His time as a player and coach was followed by a career as a sports presenter for the Nine Network.

Nicknamed The King and also [[Suncorp Stadium#Popular culture|The Emperor of Lang Park]], Lewis represented Queensland in thirty-one State of Origin games from 1980 to 1991, and was captain for thirty of them. He also represented Australia in thirty-three international matches from 1981 to 1991 and was national team captain from 1984 to 1989. Lewis is perhaps best known for his State of Origin performances, spearheading Queensland&#x27;s dominance in that competition throughout the 1980s and winning a record 8 man of the match awards.

Lewis has since been inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and in 1999 he became the sixth member of &#x27;The Immortals&#x27;. In 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia&#x27;s international standing in the sport of rugby league.

In February 2008, Lewis was named in the list of Australia&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest
Players&quot; (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code&#x27;s centenary year in Australia. Lewis went on to be named in the halves in the Kangaroos&#x27; &quot;Team of the Century&quot;. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel&#x27;s majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players. In June 2008, he was also chosen in the Queensland Rugby League&#x27;s Team of the Century at five-eighth and captain. In October 2016, he became the 38th Legend of Australian Sport at the Sport Australia Hall of Fame awards.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Wally Lewis was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;.

In 2011, Lewis was a recipient of the Queensland Greats Awards.

==Early life==
Lewis was born in Hawthorne, Queensland on 1 December 1959. His father, Jimmy, played first grade rugby league at or for Brisbane clubs Wests and Souths, later becoming coach of the Wynnum-Manly club. His mother, June, was a Queensland representative netball player. When he was six years old, Lewis was playing rugby league with Cannon Hill Stars, usually at lock forward. He played in junior Queensland school teams, at times representing his state against New South Wales before a State or Test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Lewis attended Brisbane State High School during the 1970s. In 1977 while still in high school, Lewis also played representative rugby union as a Centre, touring Europe and Japan with the Australian schoolboys team alongside the likes of Tony Melrose, Michael O&#x27;Connor, and all three Ella brothers Mark, Glen and Gary, all of whom went on to represent the Australia national rugby union team, while O&#x27;Connor would become a dual international when he played alongside Lewis for the Kangaroos.

The 1977 Australian Schoolboys Rugby Union tour of Great Britain would see the first of three times Lewis would make undefeated tours of Britain with Australian national teams.

According to Lincoln Lewis, Wally and his brother Scott, who played alongside him in the BRL, are butchers by trade.

==Rugby League career==
===Fortitude Valley===
Following his return to Australia from the 1977 Schoolboys tour, Lewis faced discrimination in the Queensland Rugby Union fraternity due to his rugby league background. After being told he would no longer be selected for any representative teams if he continued to play league, he immediately decided his future lay with rugby league, playing in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership with Valleys Diehards from 1978. Also in 1978, Lewis (and another young Brisbane based lock from Wests named Paul Vautin) turned down an offer to play in the famed Sydney premiership with the North Sydney Bears. While Lewis would remain in Brisbane in 1979, Vautin would go on to sign with 1978 Sydney premiers the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.

In 1979 Lewis made his senior début for Queensland from the bench in games played under the old State of Residence rules, and also played for a Brisbane representative side against the touring Great Britain Lions. With former Australian halfback Ross Strudwick now captain-coach of the Diehards, Lewis helped Valleys to premiership victory over the Wayne Bennett-coached Souths Magpies side in the BRL Grand Final at Lang Park. Playing in the centres for the Magpies that day was a 19-year-old cadet policeman who would become a long serving Queensland and Australian teammate of Lewis in the coming decade, Mal Meninga.

Lewis made the run-on side for Queensland in the inaugural State of Origin match in 1980 at lock forward alongside his hero Arthur Beetson who at the age of 35 was playing in his first ever game for his home state. There were some in the press who questioned his selection, claiming he should have started from the bench with well performed Brisbane Wests lock Norm Carr in the starting side. Lewis however had a hand in Queensland&#x27;s first ever State of Origin try scored by Kerry Boustead. The following year a second State of Origin match was played, and captain-coach Arthur Beetson was a late withdrawal due to injury. In what proved to be a master stroke, Beetson coached the team from the sidelines and handed the captaincy over to 21-year-old Lewis who had moved from lock to play .

His form for Queensland in both the two games played under the old residence system, and the one Origin game in which he scored one of four Qld tries, saw him selected to make his Test début for Australia in 1981, playing five-eighth in a 43–3 win over France at the SCG. At the Australian team&#x27;s first training session (at Lang Park), coach Frank Stanton wasn&#x27;t impressed with Lewis&#x27; fitness after he lagged behind in a set of 400 metre runs, though it was reported that Lewis wasn&#x27;t alone and only lock forward Ray Price had completed the runs without too much trouble. During the game Lewis had a chance to score his first test try. Backing up a line break, Lewis received the ball only 15 metres out with a clear path to the line. Hearing someone closing in from behind he passed the ball to his partner Steve Mortimer to score before he could be tackled. After scoring Mortimer questioned Lewis as to why he passed as there was no French player near him. Lewis later saw a television replay which showed it was in fact the match referee who he could hear behind him. Ironically, the try was Mortimer&#x27;s first test try in what was also his début test for Australia.

In the 1982 State of Origin series Lewis got his second Origin try and his first man-of-the-match award in Origin and later that year was a member of the 1982 Kangaroo tour as tour vice-captain. The 1982 Kangaroos became the first side to go through Great Britain and France undefeated, earning themselves the nickname The Invincibles. The tour raged with selection controversy as for the opening game of the tour against Hull Kingston Rovers, Stanton chose Parramatta&#x27;s Winfield Cup Grand Final winning halves Brett Kenny and Peter Sterling (though Lewis actually played from the bench), who went about cementing their selection for the first test. Lewis was left out of the first Ashes test against Great Britain at Boothferry Park in Hull and coach Frank Stanton had been less than impressed with his attitude to training and his off-field habits which had seen him actually gain weight. Stanton then challenged him to get back into shape and force his way back into the test team and Lewis did just that. He began training harder to lose the weight, including jogging back from training to the team base, the Dragonara Hotel in Leeds. His form also improved and he became a vital player from the bench in the final two tests at Central Park and Headingley. Lewis&#x27; finest moment on the tour came in the second half of the second test in Wigan. After coming on as a replacement for injured winger Eric Grothe (he come on to play 5/8 with Brett Kenny moving to the centres and Mal Meninga to the wing), Lewis fired a bullet-like 20 metre cut-out pass to Meninga who then scored in the corner. Although the Kangaroos had soundly beaten Great Britain until that point of the series, Lewis&#x27; pass had a psychological effect on the Lions who were left wondering just how good the Australian&#x27;s really were if they could afford to leave someone on the bench who could pass like that. Those long cut-out passes (something he learned playing junior rugby union and playing backyard football with his brothers) would become a feature of Lewis&#x27; game over the next 10 years.

During the tour, Lewis captained his first game for Australia in an international when the Kangaroos defeated Wales in a &quot;non-test&quot; at Ninian Park in Cardiff. Playing in the s, Lewis was one of four try scorers in a 37–7 win for the Kangaroos, with fullback Steve Ella leading the way with four. Wally also kicked four goals with the game played in driving rain.

Wally was selected at five-eighth for the first test against France on the French leg of the tour, but missed the second test after again dislocating his shoulder in a minor game between the tests which ended his tour as a player.

In the first and third games of the 1983 State of Origin series, Lewis was named man-of-the-match. In 1983, Lewis also regained his test five-eighth spot from Brett Kenny for the two tests against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland, and at Lang Park.

Lewis captained Queensland as they toured Papua New Guinea and England part of the 1983–84 Rugby Football League season. He played in their 8–6 defeat against Hull Kingston Rovers followed up by a 40–2 victory over Wigan RLFC and a 2–58 win over Leeds Rhinos.

Lewis played for English First Division side Wakefield Trinity for a short spell during the 1983–84 Rugby Football League season and he remains a favourite of Trinity fans, who named their fanzine &quot;Wally Lewis is Coming&quot;. Trinity won 5 of 10 games during Lewis&#x27;s stay, including a win over St. Helens in which Lewis scored a hat-trick. After his last match on 12 February, Trinity did not win another game and were relegated to the second division. Initially, Lewis had been reluctant to sign with Wakefield after having played both club and representative football almost non-stop since the start of 1982, including the Kangaroo Tour and Queensland&#x27;s three game tour of England at the end of 1983, when he came to the attention of Wakefield. The club asked him to name his price and, not believing that they could afford it, Lewis told them it would cost £30,000 for him to play in England (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £140,100 in 2016). What he did not know was that a wealthy Wakefield businessman financially supported the club and was bankrolling their attempt to sign Lewis (who by the end of 1983 had been rated the best player in rugby league). Good to his word and despite being jaded and in need of a break, Lewis signed to play his only season of English club football and became the highest paid player in England at the time.

===Wynnum-Manly===
Back in Australia, Lewis left Valleys and ultimately signed with the Wynnum-Manly Seagulls after initially considering an offer from Past Brothers. In 1984 Lewis captained an Oceania team&#x27;s 54–4 victory over an Anglo-French selection in an exhibition match Paris, returning to Brisbane after the match to continue playing for Wynnum-Manly. He gained the national captaincy for the first time in the 1984 Ashes series against Great Britain, winning a well publicised battle with Parramatta and NSW captain Ray Price and becoming the 12th Queenslander to captain Australia. Lewis was the first Queenslander to captain an Australian team to an Ashes victory. Wally was also named player of the series for his performance as captain of the Brisbane Rugby League team that won the 1984 National Panasonic Cup Final against Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs Roosters club. Lewis was named man-of-the match in the first two games of the 1984 State of Origin series, making it three consecutive Origin man-of-the-match awards. That year, he also won the Brisbane Rugby League premiership&#x27;s grand final against Souths. The following year, Lewis was awarded the inaugural Golden Boot Award as the world&#x27;s best international player in 1984.

Lewis was man-of-the-match for Game II of the 1985 State of Origin series, becoming the second player, after Mal Meninga in Game 1 1982, from the losing team to win the award. He then played in Wynnum-Manly&#x27;s 1985 BRL grand final loss to a Souths Magpies team which included Gary Belcher, Mal Meninga and Peter Jackson. The Australian side toured New Zealand that year, winning the test series 2–1. The New Zealand tour was an unhappy one though, with coach Terry Fearnley, who had just led New South Wales to their first ever State of Origin series win, not getting along with captain Lewis or the other Queensland players and seemingly favoring NSW players, especially tour vice-captain Wayne Pearce. After winning the first two tests, Fearnley dropped four players from the team, all Queenslanders, in what Queensland Rugby League boss Senator Ron McAuliffe called a &quot;Football Assassination&quot;. The changes to the team proved to be a disaster as the Kiwis defeated a disjointed Australia 18–0.

The following year, internal problems between the Seagulls club board and its head coach Des Morris saw Lewis installed as Captain-coach of Wynnum-Manly. Lewis would lead the team, which included rep players Colin Scott, Gene Miles and Bob Lindner, to a 14–6 win over Brothers in the 1986 BRL Grand Final at Lang Park. He then became the first Queenslander since Tom Gorman in 1929–30 to be named as captain for a Kangaroo tour. Following the successful 1986 Kangaroo tour which the Australians went through undefeated to earn themselves the nickname The Unbeatables, 1985 Australian coach Terry Fearnley wrote an article for &quot;Rugby League Week&quot; that was highly critical of Lewis&#x27; captaincy based on his experiences during the 1985 New Zealand tour. Don Furner, who took over as Australian coach in 1986 before the mid-season test series against New Zealand, later told that while initially weary of working with Lewis based on Fearnley&#x27;s public comments and Lewis&#x27; battles with Frank Stanton on the 1982 Kangaroo Tour, he encountered no problems with the Australian captain and the two formed a good personal and working relationship.

Although Queensland lost the 1986 State of Origin series 3–0 to NSW, the first clean sweep in Origin history, Lewis led the Australian&#x27;s to a clean sweep of New Zealand in the mid-season test series, scoring a try in the 29-12 second test win at the SCG and the 32–12 win in the final game at Lang Park. Australia also won the opening test of the series 22–8 at Carlaw Park in Auckland.

In 1987 Lewis was honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia &quot;for service to rugby league football&quot;. Also that year &quot;King Wally&quot;, a biography of Lewis written by Adrian McGregor was published. Lewis was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987. 1987 saw Lewis lead Queensland to a 2-1 Origin series win over NSW, though NSW won a fourth exhibition game played at the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Los Angeles. The Australians only played one test in 1987, suffering a shock 13–6 loss to New Zealand at Lang Park in July. It was the second time in succession that the Kangaroos, fresh from an unbeaten Kangaroo Tour, had lost a test to the Kiwis in Brisbane.

===Brisbane Broncos===
Several New South Wales Rugby League premiership clubs had attempted to lure Wally Lewis south during the 1980s, including the Bob Fulton coached Manly-Warringah which came closest to contracting him in 1986. However, the QRL, fearing they were going to lose Lewis (easily their biggest star) and possibly his Wynnum-Manly, Qld and Australian teammate Gene Miles to Manly soon after losing Souths players Gary Belcher and Mal Meninga to the Canberra Raiders, blocked the move to Sydney and Lewis stayed with the Seagulls. In 1988, Lewis finally got to play in the Sydney premiership when he was signed by the Brisbane Broncos as inaugural captain of the side upon their inception in 1988, leading the new club to a 44–10 win over defending NSWRL premiers Manly at Lang Park in their first ever game. Lewis was the Broncos&#x27; top try-scorer in their first season and also later had the honour of scoring the club&#x27;s first hat-trick.

During the season Lewis was awarded the Harry Sunderland Medal as Australia&#x27;s player of the 1988 Ashes series against Great Britain, whose 26–12 win in the dead rubber third test at the Sydney Football Stadium (SFS) was their first test victory over Australia since 1978. Lewis and teammate Sam Backo also joined Ken Irvine as the only Australian players to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. On 20 July 1988 Lewis played for Australia in their record 62-point win over Papua New Guinea, scoring a try. At the end of the season he captained Australia to victory over New Zealand in the final of the 1985 - 1988 Rugby League World Cup. Australia won the game 25–12 in front of 47,363 fans at Auckland&#x27;s home of rugby union Eden Park, though Lewis broke his right forearm in the 15th minute of the game while tackling Kiwi winger Tony Iro. After receiving treatment, he bravely played on for a further 20 minutes, making a number of one armed tackles despite being an obvious target in defense. Late in the first half when it became clear that with a 21–0 lead Australia would win the game, coach Don Furner replaced Lewis with Terry Lamb.

Lewis won another man-of-the-match award in the second game of the 1989 State of Origin series. Lewis scored a famous try in the second half of the game played at the SFS, when he went on a 40-metre cross field run to the line where he outpaced a much younger Laurie Daley, and held off NSW fullback Garry Jack&#x27;s tackle over the last 10 metres to score in the corner. From there Lewis was captain of the Australian team for their mid-season tour of New Zealand.

At the end of the 1990 season, due to salary cap restrictions, Lewis was not made a large enough offer to keep him at the Broncos, with Bennett citing the need to retain younger talent.

===Gold Coast Seagulls and coaching===
Following the souring of his relationship with the Broncos, Lewis was unwilling to move to Sydney for family reasons and in 1991, he joined the Gold Coast Seagulls and was appointed as captain by coach Malcolm Clift. He won his eighth and last man-of-the-match award in the first game of the State of Origin series that year, before playing both his last match for Queensland and Australia by the end of the season. He captained and coached Gold Coast during the 1992 NSWRL season but again finished the season in last place. In their last match under Lewis as captain-coach, the Gold Coast defeated Penrith, thus denying the Panthers a place in the finals play-offs. The following year he stopped playing but continued coaching the Seagulls, but departed after a third consecutive wooden spoon. In his time coaching Seagulls, the club had won just 7 games out of 44 played, losing the last 16 in a row.

Wally Lewis played his last game for the Seagulls in a match against a South Australian &#x27;Select&#x27; team (which included his longtime friend Paul Vautin, as well as St George Dragons players Ricky Walford and Jeff Hardy) at the Thebarton Oval in Adelaide on 7 November 1992, the night before the Australian Formula One Grand Prix.

Lewis also coached the Queensland State of Origin side in 1993 and 1994 but never won a series.

===Legacy===

Wally Lewis is remembered for his creative, playmaking football and great on-field confrontations, most notably one in the 1991 State of Origin series with Mark Geyer. Years before that his and Brett Kenny&#x27;s likenesses were put onto the State of Origin winner&#x27;s shield. The Wally Lewis Medal has been awarded to the Queensland player of the series in State of Origin from 1992 to 2003. Since 2004, it has been awarded to the player of the series from either side.

A bronze statue of Wally was raised at the entrance to Lang Park. The statue text reads:
&quot;WALLY LEWIS&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The Emperor of Lang Park&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This honour was bestowed upon Wally Lewis by the former Chairman of the Queensland Rugby League, Senator and acclaimed father of State of Origin, the late Ron McAullife, in recognition of the impact Wally had on matches played at this ground across three decades.&quot;

&quot;Lewis is arguably the greatest rugby league footballer of all time. He is one of only a handful of players to be named a Rugby League Immortal and was one of the six inaugural members of the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.&quot;

&quot;He achieved the greatest honour in Rugby League: the captaincy of his country, but it was his feats as Queensland skipper and playmaker in State of Origin that he achieved legendary status. He played 31 Origin games (30 as captain) and a record 8 Man of the Match awards over a 12-year period.&quot;

&quot;The name Wally Lewis is synonymous with State of Origin and Queensland Rugby League and continues to be an inspiration to future generations of footballers&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
Wally Lewis has also appeared in numerous advertisements during and after his football playing career. Examples include promotions for XXXX beer and Burger King.

During the 2007 season at the Broncos&#x27; 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Lewis.

In December 2009 Lewis was inducted into the Queensland Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

In November 1984, Lewis married Jacqueline in St John&#x27;s Cathedral (Brisbane); however, they separated in 2021. Together, they have two sons and one daughter: Mitchell, Lincoln and Jamie-Lee.

Wally&#x27;s son, Lincoln, was a full-time actor on the Seven Network television drama, &quot;Home and Away&quot;, winning a TV Week Logie Award for best male new talent. His other son, Mitchell is a presenter on the Nova FM radio station, Nova 106.9 in Brisbane as the station&#x27;s sports reporter and assistant producer on the &quot;Ash, Luttsy &amp; Nikki&quot; breakfast show. His daughter Jamie-Lee was born profoundly deaf. The family got confirmation of this on the day of the final State of Origin game of the 1991 series, prompting Wally&#x27;s decision to retire from Origin football following the game. Jamie-Lee is a water polo player who is currently on a scholarship to the Queensland Academy of Sport who has represented Australia, and is the first deaf person in the world to ever represent her country&#x27;s national hearing team.

In May 2010, Lewis was rushed to hospital and had his gallbladder removed.

Wally Lewis completed his autobiography, &quot;Out of the Shadows: A Champion&#x27;s Return to the Spotlight&quot;, in 2009.

Lewis is well known as a big fan of &quot;The Phantom&quot; comic series.

Following his retirement from the sport, Lewis became a television sports presenter, first on &quot;Seven Nightly News Brisbane&quot;, before moving to the higher-rating &quot;Nine News Queensland&quot; where he remained until he stepped down from the role, citing health concerns, at the beginning of January 2023.

===Epilepsy===
During the nightly news broadcast of 16 November 2006, Lewis previewed the sports segment but was not onscreen when the program returned from the commercial break, with newsreader Bruce Paige instead presenting the sports segment. A similar event occurred two weeks later, on 30 November, when Lewis appeared onscreen and began to read the autocue, saying &quot;Good evening&quot; before seeming distressed. A scheduled report was then played, with Paige delivering the rest of the bulletin. Following these events, Lewis was given medical leave for the rest of the year. The following night, Lewis revealed that he had epilepsy. Lewis has revealed in his book that his on-air disorientation was caused by the condition.

On 21 February 2007, Lewis underwent brain surgery to help his epilepsy at Austin Hospital in Melbourne. The surgery was reported as a success by Gavin Fabinyi, Director of Neurosurgery. He has since made a full recovery.

Lewis was not expected to make a return as a TV reporter until 29 January but delivered a flawless report alongside new sports presenter Steve Haddan. In September 2007, Lewis appeared on-air for the first time since the surgery, and by 2009 had returned to presenting on weeknights.

Lewis is quoted as saying that &quot;People come and ask me now about things (from his rugby league career) and I just don&#x27;t remember them at all – that&#x27;s absolutely frightening.&quot;

Lewis said he wanted to work with epilepsy organisations and raise awareness about the condition. He is also the vice patron of the Hear and Say Centre, becoming involved with the charity organization after his daughter, Jamie-Lee, was born profoundly deaf.

<text>William Brian Little (1942–2000), known as Brian Little, was one of the founding partners of Forstmann Little &amp; Company, a private equity firm. He graduated from Colgate University in 1964, and he later served as the chairman of the board of trustees. An art building at Colgate was named Little Hall after him in 2001.

Brian Little worked as a senior vice president at White Weld &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. He briefly continued to work at the firm after it was acquired by Merrill Lynch in 1978, and in the same year founded Forstmann Little with brothers Ted and Nick Forstmann.

Little died in 2000 of a heart attack at the age of 58.

<text>Nicholas Curt &quot;Nick&quot; Forstmann (January 15, 1947 – February 2, 2001) was one of the founding partners of Forstmann Little &amp; Company, a private equity firm.

After attending The Lawrenceville School, Forstmann graduated from Georgetown University in 1969, and began working at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. In 1975, Forstmann joined Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a company with which he would later develop a rivalry. He founded Forstmann Little with his older brother, Ted, and Brian Little, in 1978. Forstmann&#x27;s second brother, J. Anthony Forstmann, founded ForstmannLeff.

Forstmann served on the advisory boards of Georgetown University and Marymount College. He also served as the vice chairman of 1996 Vice Presidential candidate Jack Kemp&#x27;s &quot;Empower America&quot;, a free market advocacy group.

He also played a leading role in Forstmann Little&#x27;s bid to acquire RJR Nabisco. Forstmann was featured in the book about the bidding war, &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;, and was portrayed in the subsequent film by actor Joseph Kell.

Forstmann helped form the Inner-City Scholarship Fund of the Archdiocese of New York.

He died in 2001 of small-cell lung cancer, aged 54.

<text>Robert Henry Alexander Eames, Baron Eames, (born 27 April 1936) is an Anglican bishop and life peer, who served as Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh from 1986 to 2006.

==Early life and education==
Eames was born in 1936, the son of a Methodist minister. His early years were spent in Larne, with the family later moving to Belfast. He was educated at the city&#x27;s Belfast Royal Academy and Methodist College Belfast (from 1947 – 1955) before going on to study at the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, graduating LL.B. (Upper Second Class Honours) in 1960 and earning a Ph.D. degree in ecclesiastical law and history in 1963.

During his undergraduate course at Queen&#x27;s, one of his philosophy lecturers was his future Roman Catholic counterpart, Cahal Daly.

==Ministry==

Turning his back on legal studies for ordination in the Church of Ireland, Eames embarked on a three-year course at the divinity school of Trinity College, Dublin in 1960, but found the course &quot;intellectually unsatisfying&quot;. In 1963 he was appointed curate assistant at Bangor Parish Church, becoming rector of St Dorothea&#x27;s in Belfast three years later.

In the same year, 1966, he married Christine Daly. During his time at St Dorothea&#x27;s, in the Braniel and Tullycarnet area of east Belfast, he developed a &quot;coffee bar ministry&quot; among young people, but The Troubles interrupted. During this time he rescued a Catholic girl from a loyalist mob who had set her family home on fire. He turned down the opportunity to become dean of Cork and in 1974 was appointed rector of St Mark&#x27;s in Dundela in east Belfast, a church with strong family links to C. S. Lewis.

On 9 May 1975, at the age of 38, he was elected bishop of the cross-border Diocese of Derry and Raphoe – in a groundbreaking move, he invited his similarly young Catholic counterpart, Edward Daly, to his consecration on 9 June.
Eames was translated five years later, on 30 May 1980, to the Diocese of Down and Dromore. He was elected to Down and Dromore on 23 April and that election confirmed 20 May 1980. In 1986, he became the 14th Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland since the Church of Ireland&#x27;s break with Rome. It was an appointment that caused some level of astonishment among other church leaders.

==Drumcree controversy==

Drumcree Church, a rural parish near Portadown, became the site of a major political incident in 1996, when the annual Orangemen&#x27;s march was banned from returning to the centre of Portadown via the Nationalist Garvaghy road after attending worship at Drumcree parish church. This decision was made by the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and not the Northern Ireland parades commission who, at this time, did not have authority to prohibit parades, existing only as an advisory body. Public unrest and violence escalated and over the next three summers the situation was unstable, with other parades coming under first police and later commission sanction.

Archbishop Eames, as diocesan bishop and civil leader found himself immersed in the search for a resolution to the issue. Within the wider Church of Ireland there was unease as it is a broad church in theology and politics and has within its congregations nationalists in the south and unionists in the north. Eames, along with the rector of Drumcree, had to navigate this wider political and social controversy and sought political assistance for his efforts to defuse tension. Some bishops in the Republic of Ireland called for Eames to close the parish church. Notable among these was Bishop John Neill who later became Archbishop of Dublin.

Eames refused to do so, believing this action could have precipitated greater unrest and possibly bloodshed. Eames described the Drumcree controversy as his &quot;own personal Calvary&quot;.

==Anglicanism&#x27;s &quot;troubleshooter&quot;==

* Chairman of the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Commission on &quot;Communion and Women in the Episcopate&quot;, 1988–89.
* Chairman of the Inter-Anglican Theological and Doctrinal Commission, 1991.
* Chairman of the Lambeth Commission on Communion, 2003–2004.

Eames was, for many years, a significant figure within the general Anglican Communion. In 2003, the self-styled &quot;divine optimist&quot; was appointed Chairman of the Lambeth Commission on Communion, which examined significant challenges to unity in the Anglican Communion.

The Commission published its report (&quot;the Windsor Report&quot;) on 18 October 2004.

==Retirement and succession==
At the Church of Ireland General Synod in 2006 he announced his intention to retire on 31 December 2006. Church law permitted him to continue as primate until the age of 75 but he resigned, in good health, at the age of 69. A tribute to him in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, assessing his years of public ministry and likely legacy noted that &quot;behind the warm smile, many know there is a man of steel.&quot;

On 10 January 2007, the eleven serving bishops of the Church of Ireland, meeting at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Dublin, elected Alan Harper, Bishop of Connor, as Eames&#x27;s successor.

==Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland==
In mid 2007 he was appointed co-chairman, along with Denis Bradley, of the Consultative Group on the Past in Northern Ireland. This aimed to work out how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, especially as it affects the victims of the Troubles and their relatives.

Sources close to the Group created some controversy in early 2008 by suggesting that the Troubles could be officially classified as a &quot;war&quot;. Relatives of security force victims argued that this would demean the sacrifice of their relatives during the darkest days of the Troubles. Their relatives were often shot when off duty and unable to defend themselves; their opponents were not obeying the rules of war as commonly understood. Many of the final recommendations were derailed over the proposed payment of a pension or stipend to victims.

The Group issued its report in January 2009.

==Honours and awards==
* Select preacher at Oxford University, 1987.
* Created a life peer, he was gazetted as Baron Eames, of Armagh in the County of Armagh, on 25 August 1995 (on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, John Major, MP). He sits as a crossbencher.

The Award was presented by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, on 16 November 2006, at a special service in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh. Presenting the award, Archbishop Williams said: “We have in the Anglican Communion various ways of recognising distinguished service. There are awards given at Lambeth, there is the Cross of St Augustine. But once in a while somebody comes along for whom this doesn&#x27;t seem completely adequate and when Desmond Tutu retired, the then Archbishop of Canterbury invented the Archbishop of Canterbury&#x27;s Award for Outstanding Service to the Anglican Communion. Tonight it is a huge privilege to present that award for the second time.”

<text>Edgar &quot;Pop&quot; Buell (April 26, 1913 – December 30, 1980) was a humanitarian aid worker in Laos. He was a farmer in Steuben County, Indiana, until the age of 47, but following the death of his wife in 1958 he joined the International Voluntary Services, a precursor to the Peace Corps, which offered him a job as an agricultural adviser in Laos. Buell worked in Laos through the Laotian Civil War, organizing relief aid to refugees and isolated villages. He was forced to flee Laos in 1974 when the Communist Pathet Lao gained control of the country.

==Volunteer==
In 1958, Buell volunteered with the International Voluntary Services (IVS) at the salary of sixty-five dollars a month. In May 1960, he left Indiana for an orientation course in Washington, D.C., and then flew to Laos (his first time out of the United States) for his new job.

In Laos, Pop (as he came to be universally known) was assigned to a small village about 100 miles north of Vientiane on the Plain of Jars. He lived in a hut without plumbing or electricity, his life there reminding him of growing up on the farm in Indiana.

==The Laotian Civil War==
In the early 1960s the CIA was building up its secret Hmong army on the Plain of Jars where Buell lived. Laos&#x27; isolation and low international profile changed dramatically with a coup d&#x27;état in 1960 and the entry of Laos on the world stage as a pawn in the Cold War struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Buell became involved in the Laotian Civil War between the Royalist government, supported by the United States, and the Communist Pathet Lao. Increasingly, both the United States and North Vietnam intervened militarily in Laos to protect their toehold in the country. Unlike Vietnam, where the US sent more than 500,000 soldiers, only a few Americans, civilian and military, worked in Laos. The CIA supported local efforts to fight the Pathet Lao, made up largely of Hmong and other highlanders and Pop Buell was the man on the scene who knew the Hmong and had their trust. Many Laotians were displaced by the fighting or, in the case of the highlanders, cut off in their mountaintop villages. To Buell, now working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, fell the task of organizing relief aid to refugees and isolated villagers. Frequently, the aid was in the form of bags of rice air dropped by Air America aircraft. Air America was the CIA owned civilian airline operating in Southeast Asia. Buell became a &quot;one-man supply corps.&quot;

Buell became involved with the CIA largely through circumstance with his volunteer activities. Buell downplayed his CIA role. Although it was not central to his mission, he was one integral part of the CIA program in the Plain of Jars where the CIA was building up a Hmong resistance. To increase the Hmong tribes&#x27; effectiveness as a military force, Buell helped strengthen the Hmong economy by using his agricultural skills to improve Hmong techniques for planting and cultivating opium. Buell told the Hmong, &quot;If you&#x27;re gonna grow it, grow it good, but don&#x27;t let anybody smoke the stuff.&quot; As a result, opium production increased. Buell supplied modern day medicine to the Hmong. Because of this, local opium consumption for medical purposes declined. This made more opium available for international markets.

Buell took money out of his retirement fund to buy supplies when U.S. government funds and resources were interrupted, as they often were at the far end of the supply chain. He was known to the Hmong as Tan Pop, &quot;Uncle Pop&quot;. His opinion about the war in Laos was that it was for the Hmong to defend themselves against North Vietnam’s Pathet Lao, pointing out &quot;for every Hmong that died, one fewer American soldier died&quot; in Vietnam. Many thousands of Hmong died in the war. He became one of several seldom-seen but mythical figures of the war in Laos—which is almost always described as &quot;secret&quot;.

==Later life==
The Hmong army held off the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao for many years, but with the Paris Peace Accords of 1973 U.S. military aid and most economic aid to Laos ceased. The position of the Hmong army and the Royalist government became increasingly untenable. In 1974, Pop was out of a job with the Hmong and the U.S. government. He worked briefly as a teacher in Vientiane, but the American Embassy there soon learned that his name was on a list of people to be murdered by the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese who were completing their conquest of the country. Continental Air Services, Inc. pilot Les Strouse evacuated Buell from Laos by dressing him in a pilot&#x27;s uniform, driving him to the airport, and flying him to Bangkok, Thailand. Everything Pop owned fit into three suitcases. Pop lived in Bangkok the rest of his life. He died December 29, 1980, while visiting a friend in Manila, Philippines. He is buried beside his wife Mattie in Edon Cemetery, Edon, Ohio.

In 1967, author John Steinbeck remarked during a visit to Laos. &quot;I think Pop is an example of how the ancient Gods were born... Whether you believe it or not, there are still giants in the earth.&quot;

== History ==
The Indigenous people of the Isisford region are known as the Kuungkari people. The first Europeans to enter the area were members of the expedition led by Thomas Mitchell, who journeyed through what is now Isisford in September 1846. Mitchell described a large native encampment being present with permanent huts and well-beaten pathways. The resident people were alarmed at the arrival of this group, and Mitchell continued through with little interaction. He made camp at a nearby lagoon, which he called Yuranigh&#x27;s Pond, after Yuranigh, his Wiradjuri guide.

In 1847, Edmund Kennedy&#x27;s exploratory group travelled through the region where he obtained the name of the Barcoo River from an old Kuungkari man living near Yuranigh&#x27;s Pond.
The expedition of Augustus Charles Gregory passed through the same area in 1858. While they were encamped, they fired a shot into the scrub to scare away the local Aborigines. In 1862, the expedition led by William Landsborough camped close to the same place and likewise felt threatened by the resident Kuungkari. A number armed with clubs and throwing sticks approached the camp and Landsborough ordered his men to fire. One Kuungkari man was shot dead and another wounded.

British pastoralists began to enter the region in 1866 with John Charles Ellis and his brother Evelyn taking up land. They were sons of Charles Ellis, 6th Baron Howard de Walden and named their property Portland Downs after their maternal grandfather William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland. A year later, Charles Lumley Hill established the neighbouring Isis Downs property and John Fanning formed Ruthven. Frontier violence ensued with Fanning being killed in 1868 by resident Aboriginal men and another squatter named Richard Welford being killed in 1872. Punitive expeditions conducted by Native Police and local pastoralists such Charles Lumley Hill subsequently occurred, with many Indigenous people being shot.

In May 1875, closer development started to occur with James Whitman opening a hotel, store and blacksmith. Land for the township of Whittington was reserved in 1877, and the town was surveyed as the Town of Wittown in April 1878; it is said that Whitman named it after himself. 

Isis Downs Post Office opened on 1 June 1868 and was replaced by the Wittown office in 1876. However, in May 1878, the name Isisford was proposed and by August 1878 it had been renamed Isisford, because it was near the Isis Downs pastoral run and a ford on the Barcoo River. In the following years the town progressed with the growth of the pastoral industry. A post office and telegraph line were operating by 1881. 
Isisford Private School opened in the 1870s. It was by operated by Mr R Venables. It closed when Isisford Provisional School opened on 19 October 1881 with Venables becoming its first teacher. Circa 1883 the provisional school became Isisford State School. In 1892 it became Isisford Provisional School, returning to state school status in January 1894.
The Queensland Government called for tenders to build a court house in Isisford in August 1883 with the contract awarded to William McLaughlin in November 1883. The court house was completed in November 1885.

In April 1910, Isisford became the first town in Australia to be serviced by a motorised mail delivery (from Ilfracombe, to the north). A plaque on the post office commemorates the centenary of the commencement of the service.

Isisford Convent School was established in 1950 by the Presentation Sisters. It closed in 1970.

In September 1956, a deliberately lit fire at the Isisford Hotel resulted in the deaths of a mother and her child.

In the mid-1990s, the first fossils of &quot;Isisfordia&quot;, an extinct genus of crocodile-like animals, was discovered in a dry creek close to the town. The discovery was made by the town&#x27;s former Deputy Mayor, Ian Duncan, after which the new species was named.

On 10 September 2021, a new locality called Yaraka was created around the town of Yaraka, the land being excised from the locality of Isisford, to avoid confusion and restore historical connections.

<text>A commode is any of many pieces of furniture. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; has multiple meanings of &quot;commode&quot;. The first relevant definition reads: &quot;A piece of furniture with drawers and shelves; in the bedroom, a sort of elaborate chest of drawers (so in French); in the drawing room, a large (and generally old-fashioned) kind of chiffonier.&quot; The drawing room is itself a term for a formal reception room, and a chiffonier is, in this sense, a small sideboard dating from the early 19th century.

Another meaning attested is a washstand, a piece of furniture equipped with basin, jug, and towel rail, and often with space to store the chamber pot behind closed doors. A washstand in the bedroom pre-dates indoor bathrooms and running water.

In British English, &quot;commode&quot; is the standard term for a commode chair, often on wheels, enclosing a chamber pot—as used in hospitals and assisted living homes. In the United States, a &quot;commode&quot; is now a colloquial synonym for a flush toilet.

The word &quot;commode&quot; comes from the French word for &quot;convenient&quot; or &quot;suitable&quot;, which in turn comes from the Latin adjective &quot;commodus&quot;, with similar meanings.

==History and types==

===France===
The term originates in the vocabulary of French furniture from about 1700. At that time, a &quot;commode&quot; meant a cabinet or chest of drawers, low enough so that it sat at the height of the dado rail (&quot;à hauteur d&#x27;appui&quot;). It was a piece of veneered case furniture much wider than it was high, raised on high or low legs.

Commodes were made by &quot;ébénistes&quot;; the French word for &quot;cabinet-maker&quot; is derived from ebony, a black tropical hardwood notable as a foreign luxury. The beautiful wood was complemented with ormolu (gilt-bronze drawer pulls). The piece of furniture would be provided with a marble slab top selected to match the marble of the chimneypiece.

A commode occupied a prominent position in the room for which it was intended: it stood against the pier between the windows, in which case it would often be surmounted by a mirror glass, or a pair of identical commodes would flank the chimneypiece or occupy the center of each end wall.

&quot;Bombé&quot; commodes, with surfaces shaped in three dimensions, were a feature of the rococo style called &quot;Louis Quinze&quot;. Rectilinear neoclassical, or &quot;Louis Seize&quot;, commodes might have such deep drawers or doors that the feet were &quot;en toupie&quot;—in the tapering turned shape of a child&#x27;s spinning top. Both rococo and neoclassical commodes might have cabinets flanking the main section, in which case such a piece was a &quot;commode à encoignures&quot;; pairs of &quot;encoignures&quot; or corner-cabinets might also be designed to complement a commode and stand in the flanking corners of a room. If a commode had open shelves flanking the main section it was a &quot;commode à l&#x27;anglaise&quot;; if it did not have enclosing drawers it was a &quot;commode à vantaux&quot;.

Before the mid-eighteenth century the commode had become such a necessary article of furniture that it might be made in &quot;menuiserie&quot; (carpentry), of solid painted oak, walnut or fruitwoods, with carved decoration, typical of French provincial furniture.

===England===
In the English-speaking world, &quot;commode&quot; passed into cabinet-makers&#x27; parlance in London by the mid-eighteenth century to describe chests of drawers with gracefully curved fronts, and sometimes with shaped sides as well, perceived as being in the &quot;French&quot; taste. Thomas Chippendale employed the term &quot;French Commode Tables&quot; to describe designs in &quot;The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer&#x27;s Director&quot; (1753), and Ince and Mayhew illustrated a &quot;Commode Chest of drawers&quot;, plate xliii, in their &quot;Universal System of Household Furniture&quot;, 1759–62. John Gloag notes that &quot;Commode&quot; expanded to describe any piece of furniture with a serpentine front, such as a dressing table, or even a chair seat. Gloag points out that Thomas Shearer&#x27;s designs for two &quot;commode dressing chests&quot; illustrated in &quot;The Cabinet-Makers&#x27; London Book of Prices&quot;, 1788, plate 17, are repeated, but as &quot;serpentine dressing chests&quot;, in &quot;The Prices of Cabinet Work&quot;, 1797 edition.

==Toilet==


In British English, &quot;commode&quot; is the standard term for a commode chair, often on wheels, enclosing a chamber pot—as used in hospitals and the homes of disabled persons. (The historic equivalent is the close stool, hence the coveted and prestigious position Groom of the Stool for a courtier close to the monarch.) This piece of furniture is termed in French a chaise percée (&quot;pierced chair&quot;); similar items were made specifically as moveable bidets for washing.

In the United States, a &quot;commode&quot; is a colloquial synonym for a flush toilet particularly in the American South.

<text>Historadiography is a technique formerly utilized in the fields of histology and cellular biology to provide semiquantitative information regarding the density of a tissue sample. It is usually synonymous with microradiography. This is achieved by layering a ground section of mineralized tissue (such as bone) with photographic emulsion on a glass slide and exposing the sample to a beam of X-rays. After developing the emulsion, the resulting radiograph can be viewed with a microscope. A side-by-side comparison with a slide containing radiographs of various substances of known mass can provide a rough mass estimate, and therefore a rough approximation of the concentration of calcium salts in the sample.

Historadiography has also been used to visualize staining of tissue, such as spinal cord samples with thorotrast, which contains thorium that is opaque to X-rays.

Over recent decades researchers have generally lost interest in historadiography. The most recent publication using the term (1998) to be indexed in PubMed referred to autoradiography of tritium incorporated in thymidine.

<text>Prince Makonnen Haile Selassie, Duke of Harar (baptismal name: &quot;Araya Yohannes&quot;; 16 October 1924 – 13 May 1957) was the second son, and second-youngest child, of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and Empress Menen Asfaw. He was made &quot;Mesfin&quot; (or Duke) of Harar upon the coronation of his parents in 1930.

==Prince Makonnen&#x27;s family==

Prince Makonnen was married to Sara Gizaw, who also became a Princess and the Duchess of Harar. Together they had six sons, all of whom are entitled to the style of &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;:

* Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Paul Wossen Seged, Duke of Harar (Addis Ababa, 21 August 1947 – 10 November 2021). Married 19 March 1995 to Connie Jo Quave, (b. 30 September 1957)
* Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Mikael, Duke of Harar (b. Addis Ababa, 30 January 1950). Married to Princess Asrat Amaha Yesus.
* Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Dawit (b. Addis Ababa, 30 January 1952-Nyon, Switzerland, 26 August 1989). Married 16 April 1974 to Princess Adey-Abeba Imru Makonnen (b. 11 March 1951, elder daughter of H.E. &quot;Lij&quot; Imru Zelleke, Ambassador to Germany and Minister of State, and his wife &quot;Woizero&quot; Martha Nasibu, later &quot;Marchesa&quot; Francesco Tortora Brayda di Belvedere, daughter of H.E. General &quot;Ras&quot; Nasibu Zamanuel, Minister of War), and had two sons:
** Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Yokshan Dawit Makonnen (b. Vero Beach, Florida, 8 February 1978)
** Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Joel Dawit Makonnen (b. Rome, 5 May 1982). Married 9 September 2017 to Ariana Austin (b. Washington, 6 January 1986) 
* Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Fileppos Tafari Makonnen (Prince Philip Makonnen) (b. Addis Ababa, 15 June 1954). Educ in the UK, living in USA. Married 19 July 1990 to Princess Aster Abitow Makonnen (b. Addis Ababa, 1 February 1968), and had two sons and one daughter:
** Princess (&quot;Leult&quot;) Edna Tafari Makonnen (b. 5 January 1991). Married 30 April 2022 to Jamal Robinson
** Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Dawit Tafari Makonnen (b. Fort Wayne, Indiana, 1992)
** Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Isayas Tafari Makonnen (b. Toronto, 1998)
* Prince (&quot;Leul&quot;) Beede Mariam (b. Addis Ababa, 30 March 1957). Married to Princess Mahelate Be&#x27;eda Mariam and had one daughter: 
** Princess (&quot;Leult&quot;) Blaine Be&#x27;eda Mariam

In addition, Prince Makonnen also had a natural daughter, &quot;Woizero&quot; Meheret Makonnen, born before 1945.

In 1974, with the overthrow of the Ethiopian monarchy, the widowed Duchess of Harar and her sons were all placed under detention, with the exception of Prince Taffari who was abroad at school and Prince David Makonnen who was attending advanced military training in the United States. After a long and harsh imprisonment, Princess Sara was released by the Derg regime along with the other female members of the Imperial family in 1989. A year later, her sons were also released from their imprisonment. Days before their release, Prince Dawit Makonnen died in Switzerland.

After the fall of the Derg regime, Princess Sara and her sons were allowed to travel abroad. And after a number of years living in London, they returned to live in Addis Ababa. The Duchess of Harar was prominent at the Imperial funerals held for her brother-in-law, the Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen (also known as Emperor-in-Exile Amha Selassie I), the Emperor Haile Selassie I, and the funeral for Princess Tenagnework. She died in 2019.

==Death==
It was widely believed that Emperor Haile Selassie favoured the Duke of Harar over all his other children, and it was even rumoured that the Emperor even considered naming Makonnen as his heir, instead of his liberal elder son, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen. However, Prince Makonnen died in a car crash in 1957 on his way to the resort town of Nazreth from Debre Zeyit, east of Addis Ababa. He was buried in the crypt of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa. Some believe the car crash was an assassination plot by the Prince&#x27;s political enemies. He was 32 years old at the time of his death.

<text>Burrard Inlet () is a shallow-sided fjord in the northwestern Lower Mainland, British Columbia, Canada. Formed during the last Ice Age, it separates the City of Vancouver and the rest of the lowland Burrard Peninsula to the south from the coastal slopes of the North Shore Mountains, which span West Vancouver and the City and District of North Vancouver to the north.

Burrard Inlet opens west into the Strait of Georgia between Point Atkinson and Point Grey. Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Peninsula protrudes northwesterly into the inlet, separating it into the wide outer Burrard Inlet to the west and the elongated inner Burrard Inlet to the east. The southeastern portion of the outer inlet is an open bay known as English Bay, which has a narrow eastern inlet called False Creek. The strait between Prospect Point and the sandbanks just east of the Capilano River mouth, which connects the inlet&#x27;s outer and inner sections, is known as the First Narrows, traversed by the Lions Gate Bridge. The inner inlet then widens into Vancouver Harbour, which hosts the Port of Vancouver, Canada&#x27;s largest port.

At the eastern end of the harbour, Burrard Inlet narrows again into a strait between Burnaby Heights and the mouth of the Seymour River, known as the Second Narrows, which is traversed by the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge and the Second Narrows Rail Bridge. After the Second Narrows, it widens again and continues east until the headland near Dollarton, where it splits into two arms. The longer arm, known as Indian Arm, extends northerly between Mount Seymour and Eagle Mountain until it meets the deltas of Indian River mouth. The shorter arm, known as Port Moody Arm or Moody Inlet, courses further east for another past a strait (traversed only by overhead powerlines) between Burnaby Mountain and the bluffs of Belcarra Regional Park. Port Moody Arm is almost completely encompassed by the City of Port Moody.

== History ==
What is now known as Burrard Inlet has been home to the Indigenous peoples of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-waututh Bands, who have resided in this territory for thousands of years. In 1791, the first European explorers in the region, Juan Carrasco and José María Narváez, sailing under orders of Francisco de Eliza, entered the western part of the inlet in their ship, &quot;Santa Saturnina&quot;. They failed to find the Fraser River, mistaking the lowland of the river&#x27;s delta as a major inlet of the sea, which they named Canal de Floridablanca. This led to one of the prime objectives of the 1792 expedition of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano, which was to determine the exact nature of the Canal de Floridablanca. Galiano spent many days exploring the general area, realizing that there was a great river there and sighting Burrard Inlet itself on June 19, 1792. Just days later, the inlet was again named by Captain George Vancouver, after his friend and former shipmate Captain Harry Burrard Neale.

In 1888, the inlet was described in &quot;The British Columbia Pilot&quot; published by the British Admiralty as follows.
== Geography ==

The inlet runs almost directly east from the Strait of Georgia to Port Moody. About two-thirds of the way east from the mouth of the inlet, the steep-sided Indian Arm branches off to the north between Belcarra and Deep Cove on into the Pacific Ranges.

Near the mouth of the inlet, a small section of the inlet along the curved stretch of the Burrard Peninsula is named English Bay. From English Bay, a small inlet named False Creek branches off to the east and incises the peninsula.

===Extent===
The extent of Burrard Inlet is defined as a line between Point Atkinson and Point Grey on the west, the end of Port Moody Arm on the east, and the head of Indian Arm on the north. The inlet is about long from the Strait of Georgia to Port Moody, or about from the Strait of Georgia to the head of Indian Arm.

==Settlements==
Settlements on the shores of Burrard Inlet include Vancouver, West Vancouver, North Vancouver, Burnaby, and Port Moody. Three bridges, the First Narrows Bridge (alias Lions Gate Bridge) (built in the 1930s), the Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing (1960) and the CNR railway bridge (1969) at the Second Narrows, and the SeaBus passenger ferry, cross the inlet. Aside from just east of the inlet&#x27;s mouth (where it includes English Bay), it is widest (about ) between the First and Second Narrows, also the busiest part of Vancouver&#x27;s port.

== Port of Vancouver ==
Protected from the open ocean, the calm waters of Burrard Inlet form Vancouver&#x27;s primary port area, an excellent one for large ocean-going ships. While some of the shoreline is residential and commercial, much is port-industrial, including railyards, terminals for container and bulk cargo ships, grain elevators, and (towards the eastern end) oil refineries. Freighters waiting to load or discharge cargoes in the inlet often anchor in English Bay, which lies south of the mouth of the inlet and is separated from it by Vancouver&#x27;s downtown peninsula and Stanley Park.

On the main inlet, a few park areas remain forested as they were centuries ago, but the steep slopes of Indian Arm are so impassable that most have seen no development, despite the proximity of such a major city. Only in 2003 was a rough wilderness hiking trail around the whole of Indian Arm completed, and it was the work of one man over many years.

== Major crossings ==
The major crossings of Burrard Inlet, from west to east, are as follows:
* Lions Gate Bridge
* SeaBus
* Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing, or 
** Second Narrows Bridge

<doc id="953759" wikidata="Q422779" url="?curid=953759" title="Methyl formate">
<text>Methyl formate, also called methyl methanoate, is the methyl ester of formic acid. The simplest example of a carboxylate ester, it is a colorless liquid with an ethereal odour, high vapor pressure, and low surface tension. It is a precursor to many other compounds of commercial interest.

==Production==
In the laboratory, methyl formate can be produced by the condensation reaction of methanol and formic acid, as follows:

:HCOOH + CH3OH → HCOOCH3 + H2O

Industrial methyl formate, however, is usually produced by the combination of methanol and carbon monoxide (carbonylation) in the presence of a strong base, such as sodium methoxide:

This process, practiced commercially by BASF among other companies gives 96% selectivity toward methyl formate. The catalyst for this process is sensitive to water, which can be present in the carbon monoxide feedstock, which is commonly derived from synthesis gas. Very dry carbon monoxide is, therefore, essential.

==Uses==
Methyl formate is used primarily to manufacture formamide, dimethylformamide, and formic acid. These compounds are precursors or building blocks for many useful derivatives.

Because of its high vapor pressure, it is used for quick-drying finishes and as a blowing agent for some polyurethane foam applications (for example Ecomate® manufactured by Foam Supplies Inc.) and as a replacement for CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs. Methyl formate has near zero ozone depletion potential and zero global warming potential and a short atmospheric life of 3 days.

It is also used as an insecticide.

A historical use of methyl formate, which sometimes brings it attention, was in refrigeration. Before the introduction of less-toxic refrigerants, methyl formate was used as an alternative to sulfur dioxide in domestic refrigerators, such as some models of the famous GE Monitor Top.

<text>Joseph Franklin Harris (born February 16, 1936) is an American businessman and Democratic politician who served as the 78th governor of Georgia from 1983 to 1991.

Harris attended Asbury College for one year, then went on to graduate from the University of Georgia in 1958 with a degree in business administration. While attending Georgia, he also became a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Upon graduation, Harris returned to his native Cartersville, Georgia to join his father Frank and brother Fred in the family run cement business.

Harris called himself the education governor as he raised the state salaries for teachers. and implemented the Quality Basic Education Act (QBE), built the Georgia Dome, created the Technical College System of Georgia formerly known as the Department of Adult &amp; Technical Education, and lured the 1996 Summer Olympics to Atlanta. Harris is also credited with building more libraries during his term than any other governor in Georgia&#x27;s history. Also during his term, Harris created the Growth Strategies Commission chaired by Cartersville native and prominent developer Joel Cowan. His fiscal strategies resulted in higher bond ratings for the state and during his governorship Georgia was rated among the country&#x27;s top 15 best-managed states by &quot;Financial World&quot;.

== Board of regents ==
After two terms as governor, Harris was appointed to the Board of Regents for the University System of Georgia serving for seven years, two years as chairman.

== Georgia State University ==
From 1995 through 2009, Harris served at Georgia State University as an executive fellow and lecturer in the School of Policy Studies. He is chairman of the board of Harris Georgia Corporation, an industrial development firm that was established in 1980 in Cartersville, Georgia. He also served on the board of directors for Aflac from 1991 to 2011.

== Legacy ==
The portion of U.S. Route 41 through Bartow County is named in his honor (Joe Frank Harris Parkway), as well as the Joe Frank Harris Commons that houses The Village Summit Dining Commons at the University of Georgia, the main entrance to the Georgia Ports Authority in Brunswick, Georgia (Joe Frank Harris Blvd.), and the main entrance to the Georgia State Fairgrounds in Perry (Governor Joe Frank and Mrs. Elizabeth Harris Blvd.).

<doc id="953799" wikidata="Q284551" url="?curid=953799" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559">
<text>United Nations Security Council resolution 1559, adopted on 2 September 2004, after recalling resolutions 425 (1978), 426 (1978), 520 (1982) and 1553 (2004) on the situation in Lebanon, the Council supported free and fair presidential elections in Lebanon, urging the Lebanese government to establish control over its territory, disarm militias like Hezbollah, and facilitate the withdrawal of any remaining foreign forces from the country.

Nine countries voted in favor: Angola, Benin, Chile, France, Germany, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Six countries abstained: Algeria, Brazil, China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Russia.

The resolution was sponsored by France and the United States. The cooperation between these two nations on an issue concerning the Middle East was seen as a significant improvement in their relationship, compared to their earlier bitter disagreement over the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Because Lebanon was governed by France as a League of Nations mandate 1919–1943, France has long taken a special interest in Lebanon.

== Contents of resolution ==
It called on Lebanon to establish its sovereignty over all of its territory and called on Syria as a foreign force to withdraw from Lebanon and to cease intervening in the internal politics of Lebanon. The resolution also called on all Lebanese and foreign forces on Lebanese soil to disband and declared support for a &quot;free and fair electoral process&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
The resolution was coauthored by France and the United States. Echoing the Taif Agreement, the resolution &quot;calls upon all remaining foreign forces to withdraw from Lebanon&quot; and &quot;for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias.&quot; Lebanon has requested that Israel withdraw from the disputed Shebaa Farms and the hills of Kfar-Shouba and return the Lebanese detainees in Israel as a condition for fully implementing Resolution 1559 which includes disbanding of the military wing of Hezbollah. Critics of the resolution argue however that an attempt from the weak and politically divided Lebanese army to disarm Hezbollah would be very difficult and could restart the Lebanese civil war. Syria was also in violation of the resolution until recently because of their military presence in Lebanon.

On 7 October 2004, the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan reported to the Security Council regarding the lack of compliance with Resolution 1559. Mr. Annan concluded his report by saying: &quot;It is time, 14 years after the end of hostilities and four years after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, for all parties concerned to set aside the remaining vestiges of the past. The withdrawal of foreign forces and the disbandment and disarmament of militias would, with finality, end that sad chapter of Lebanese history.&quot;

The 20 January 2005 UN Secretary-General&#x27;s report on Lebanon stated that &quot;The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the Shab&#x27;a farms area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions. The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978). The UN Security Council has repeatedly requested that all parties respect the Blue Line in its entirety.&quot;

On 28 January 2005, Resolution 1583 called upon the Government of Lebanon to fully extend and exercise its sole and effective authority throughout the south, including through the deployment of sufficient numbers of Lebanese armed and security forces, to ensure a calm environment throughout the area, including along the Blue Line, and to exert control over the use of force on its territory and from it.

Syria made few moves to comply with the resolution until the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, on 14 February 2005. International pressure to withdraw intensified and public perception in Lebanon turned strongly against Syria, evidenced by mass demonstrations that were labeled the Cedar Revolution. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria announced on 5 March 2005 that he planned to &quot;bring his forces home.&quot; The withdrawal, which involved about 14,000 troops, took about seven weeks to complete.

On 26 April 2005, after 29 years of military action in Lebanon, the last Syrian troops left Lebanon. Syrian military and intelligence facilities, after the destruction of sensitive documents or the transportation of logistical material, were turned over to Lebanese counterparts. This action left the Lebanese government as the main violator of the resolution due to its refusal to dismantle the pro-Syrian Palestinian and Hezbollah militias.

On 27 December 2005, Katyusha rockets fired from Hezbollah territory smashed into houses in the Israeli city of Kiryat Shmona wounding three people. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called on the Lebanese government &quot;to extend its control over all its territory, to exert its monopoly on the use of force, and to put an end to all such attacks&quot;.

On 23 January 2006, the UN Security Council called on the Government of Lebanon to make more progress in controlling its territory and disbanding militias, while also calling on Syria to cooperate with those efforts. In a statement read out by its January President, Augustine Mahiga of Tanzania, the council also called on Syria to take measures to stop movements of arms and personnel into Lebanon.

==Lebanese response==
The Lebanese government officially responded to the resolution on the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) website in as follows:
# The only foreign forces existing in Lebanon are the Israeli forces which occupy the farms of Shebaa. Whereas the Syrian forces are friendly Arab forces which entered Lebanon according to the Lebanese government&#x27;s demand and their existence is regulated by the convention of brotherhood and coordination and cooperation between Lebanon and Syria and a copy of this convention was submitted to the United States at that time. - And in this context the Syrian forces carried out five redeployment operations in the Lebanese regions according to the resolution of the mutual military committee of the two brother armies.
# An immediate withdrawal of the Syrian Arab forces according to the security council&#x27;s resolution number 1559 cannot be executed however the redeployment operations are carried out in cooperation between the two countries and specifically in the framework of the high military committee. The national resistance which is confronting the Israeli occupation is not a guerilla and it has no security role inside the country and its activities are restricted to facing the Israeli enemy. This resistance led to the withdrawal of the enemy from the bigger part of our occupied land and is still persistent to free the farms of Shebaa. Preserving this resistance constitutes a Lebanese strategic interest with the aim of relating the struggle with the enemy and regain all the Lebanese legitimate rights achieving and at the forefront the withdrawal of Israel from the farms of Shebaa and the return of the refugees to their land.
# As for the Palestinian presence in the camps in all its known considerations is resultant from the practices of Israel which expulsed the Palestinians and the resort of a part of them to Lebanon, and most of them live in refugee camps fostered by the United Nations and the UNRWA organization. The Palestinians are claiming the right of return according to the international resolutions and especially the resolution number 194. In this framework the government preserved their particularities inside the camps which the army encircles and does not allow the traffic of arms outside of it and the army offered many martyrs and exerted great efforts to control the situation.
# The Lebanese who are familiar with the ruthless ordeals that the country witnessed during a long period of time paid its price with a huge flood of blood and losses of properties, and knew the ways to escape from the absurd wars and the others&#x27; conflicts on their land, and realized the importance of the return of security and stability and prosperity to the country, are those who are fully aware of what serves their interests and guarantees and preserves the independence and sovereignty of their country away from the suspicious adventures which has proven their barrenness, and all the attempts in this field constitute the best evidence.

Hezbollah and the Loyalty to the Resistance bloc denounced a report on the resolution in 2010 as meddling in Lebanese affairs.

== Lebanese political debate ==
The question of compliance with Resolution 1559 is a prominent matter in Lebanese politics. Former PM Fouad Siniora stated in January 2006 that the Lebanese government considered the armament of Hezbollah to be a domestic affair which, in his opinion, should reassure Hezbollah that the government will protect its military wing.

Druze leader MP Walid Jumblatt has repeatedly insisted that he objects to the disarmament of Hezbollah, according to the international resolution, describing the party as a &quot;resistance group&quot; and not a militia. He engaged in an electoral alliance with Hezbollah during the 2005 parliamentary election, with one of the titles of the alliance being &quot;The Protection of the Resistance,&quot; but is now calling on Hezbollah to be integrated into the Lebanese Army and hand in its weapons over to the government.

Siniora has more stated on 20 July 2006 that &quot;the continued presence of Israeli occupation of Lebanese lands in the Shebaa Farms region is what contributes to the presence of Hezbollah weapons. The international community must help us in (getting) an Israeli withdrawal from Shebaa Farms so we can solve the problem of Hezbollah&#x27;s arms.&quot;

Critics have said that the existence of Hezbollah, is a violation of UN security council resolution 1559, which was adopted in 2004 since it called for all militias in Lebanon, including Hezbollah to disband. Part of the mandate of UNFIL which has operated in Lebanon since 1978 mission in Lebanon is to disarm Hezbollah.

<doc id="953800" wikidata="Q3632298" url="?curid=953800" title="Andy Bichel">
<text>Andrew John Bichel (born 27 August 1970) is a former Australian cricketer, who played 19 Test matches and 67 One Day Internationals for Australia between 1997 and 2004. He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler, but was also a hard-hitting lower-order batsman. Bichel was a member of the Australian team who won the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

Bichel represented Queensland in the Australian domestic competitions. He also played for Worcestershire, Hampshire and Essex in English county cricket.

Since retiring from playing, Bichel has been a coach and a selector. He is a cousin of Chris Sabburg.

==Personal life==
Bichel was born to parents of German ancestry, married Dion in 1997 and they have two children.

==Domestic career==
As well as Queensland&#x27;s state team, he has played for the English Counties Essex, Hampshire and Worcestershire, where he had successful sessions on Essex with the bat and ball.

==International career==
===Early years===
Bichel made his Test debut for Australia in Adelaide in 1996 in a match against the West Indies, and his one-day international debut in Brisbane in the same year, also against the West Indies.

His rise to prominence coincided with the emergence of a young Brett Lee, with whom he was, for many years, often in a battle with Lee for the third fast-bowler spot in the Australian line-up behind Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie. As the younger and pacier Lee was often selected ahead of him, Bichel now holds the Test match record of being twelfth man for Australia on 19 occasions. He would later claim that his bowling suffered during these times, as he missed out on the valuable match practice that he could have earned either playing for Australia or Queensland.

=== 2003 Cricket World Cup ===
A highlight of Bichel&#x27;s career was Australia&#x27;s 2003 World Cup campaign. He was initially back up to Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath, playing his first game against Netherlands and making a good impression with the ball. However, after injury prematurely ended Gillespie&#x27;s World Cup tournament, Bichel took over his position in the side. Bichel would go on to retrieve Australia from serious trouble on more than one occasion, most notably with figures of 7–20 against England. This bowling performance became the best-ever figures against England in ODIs, the best bowling at St George&#x27;s Park in ODIs, and the best bowling in a World Cup match as well.

In the same match, he also played a crucial role with the bat, combining with Michael Bevan for an unbeaten 73-run ninth-wicket partnership to ease Australia to victory, with Bickel finishing on 34 not out. Similarly, in the Super Six stage, he came to the crease with Australia floundering at just 84-7 against New Zealand. Bichel and Bevan again saved Australia, with Bichel registering his highest score of 64 as Australia put up a winning total batting first. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka, he bowled tightly, conceding only 0–18 in 10 overs but his fielding pressure caused the spectacular run out of Aravinda de Silva as Bichel picked up, spun around and threw down the stumps to prevent a tight single off his own bowling. In the final against India, he picked up one wicket, bowling Rahul Dravid, as Australia won, completing an undefeated campaign.

== Injury and retirement ==
At the start of the 2004–05 Australian summer, Bichel was not offered a contract by Cricket Australia, an indication that its selectors did not realistically believe he would represent Australia in that season. His performances in the domestic competition, however, continued to be at the same high standards as before and it was clear he wanted to make another return to the international scene. Bichel&#x27;s bowling at state level during the 2004–05 domestic season earned him the Domestic Player of the Year award at the 2005 Australian cricket awards.

However, he announced his retirement on 9 February 2009, saying he never fully recovered from his shoulder injury.

==Post retirement==
Chennai Super Kings, the IPL Champions of 2010 season, acquired Andy Bichel&#x27;s services as a bowling coach for the team&#x27;s youngsters for IPL 2011 season. He was later the coach of Papua New Guinea. On 11 November 2011, it was announced that Andy Bichel would join the Cricket Australia selection panel.

In 2014 it was announced that Bichel had partnered Tangalooma Island Resort to be an official brand ambassador.

Bichel has been well credited for his art in the fast bowling coaching landscape. His mantra of &#x27;FTOO&#x27; is preached throughout Queensland Cricket.

<doc id="953802" wikidata="Q60520157" url="?curid=953802" title="Mexican jumping bean">
<text>Mexican jumping beans () are seed pods that have been inhabited by the larva of a small moth (&quot;Cydia saltitans&quot;) and are native to Mexico. The pod is usually tan to brown. They are from the shrub &quot;Sebastiania pavoniana&quot;, often also referred to as &quot;jumping bean&quot;. However, they are not related to actual beans (legume plants), but rather to spurges. The beans are considered non-toxic but are not generally eaten. In the spring, when the shrub is flowering, moths lay their eggs on the shrub&#x27;s hanging seedpods. When the eggs hatch, tiny larvae bore into the immature green pods and begin to devour the seeds. The pods ripen, fall to the ground and separate into three smaller segments, and those segments are called Mexican jumping beans. As the tiny larvae inside curl up and uncurl, they hit the capsule&#x27;s wall, and the bean appears to jump. They move more as temperatures rise. The larva eats away the inside of the bean (until it becomes hollow) and attaches itself to the inside of the bean with silk-like thread.
Physicists at Seattle University theorize, using Brownian motion as a model, that the larva&#x27;s random walk helps to find shade to survive on hot days. Although it does not optimize for finding shade quickly, the strategy minimizes the chances of never finding shade when shade is sparse.

The larva may live for months inside the bean with varying periods of dormancy. If the larva has adequate conditions of moisture and temperature, it will live long enough to go into a pupal stage. In the spring, the moth forces itself out of the bean through a round &quot;trap door&quot;, leaving behind the pupal casing. After its metamorphosis, the small, silver and gray-colored moth lives for no more than a few days.

==Novelty==

When the bean is warmed (by being held in the palm of the hand, for example) the larva will move to eat, pulling on the threads and causing the characteristic hop. Leaving the beans in a hot environment can kill the larva.

==Sources==
The Mexican jumping bean comes from the mountains in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chihuahua. Álamos, Sonora, calls itself the &quot;Jumping Bean Capital of the World&quot;. They are in an area approximately 50 by 160 km (30 by 100 miles) where the &quot;Sebastiania pavoniana&quot; host tree grows. During the spring, moths emerge from last year&#x27;s beans and deposit their eggs on the flower of the host tree.

<text>Mundubbera ( ) is a rural town and a locality in the North Burnett Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Mundubbera had a population of 1,120 people.

Mundubbera is the self-proclaimed &quot;Citrus Capital of Queensland&quot;, although this is disputed by the neighbouring (and rival) town of Gayndah.

== Geography ==
The town is in the Wide Bay–Burnett region on the Burnett Highway, north west of the state capital, Brisbane, north of Dalby and west of the regional centre, Bundaberg. The Mundubbera-Durong Road exits to the south.

Mundubbera is built on the bank on the Burnett River.

The Mundubbera district is bounded on the east by the Binjour Plateau and on the south and west by the Burnett River. Devonian, Carboniferous, Triassic, and post-Triassic sediments have all been found in the district. Devonian and Carboniferous sediments are incorporated into the late or post-Permian folds which affect the Yarrol Basin. A large syncline is exposed, commonly called the Mundubbera Syncline. Folded Triassic strata are found in the western part of the district in a fault block. There is evidence of Tertiary or post-Triassic sediments in horizontal sandstone. Near Riverleigh, fossil corals were found in limestone during the 1920s. These were studied by Dorothy Hill of the University of Queensland.

==History==

Gureng Gureng (also known as Gooreng Gooreng, Goreng Goreng, Goeng, Gurang, Goorang Goorang, Korenggoreng) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Gureng Gureng people. The Gooreng Gooreng language region includes the towns of Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Miriam Vale extending south towards Childers, inland to Monto and Mt Perry. Wakka Wakka (Waka Waka, Wocca Wocca, Wakawaka) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in the Burnett River catchment. The Wakka Wakka language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the North and South Burnett Regional Council, particularly the towns of Mundubbera, Cherbourg, Murgon, Kingaroy, Gayndah, and Eidsvold.

The name of the town comes from the name of a pastoral property established in 1848 by H.P. Bouverie. It is believed to be an Aboriginal word, possibly from the Kabi language, meaning &quot;sharp ridges&quot; or &quot;climbing steps cut in a tree&quot;. It has also been suggested it may mean &quot;meeting place of the waters&quot; referring to the confluence of the Burnett, Auburn and Boyne rivers just upstream from Mundubbera.

European settlement took place in the late 1840s. A town reserve was established on 26 November 1861. Closer settlement, involving migrants from Germany, Britain and the Netherlands, did not take place until the early 1900s and the town was established in its existing site prior to World War I.

Mundubbera Post Office opened by 1 July 1912 (a receiving office had been open from 1911).

Mundubbera State School opened on 7 November 1913. The school was originally on land bordered by Stuart-Russell, Mahoney and Leichhardt Streets. In 1963, a new site in Bunce Street was developed to offer secondary schooling to Year 10. New classrooms for primary schooling were added in Bunce Street in 1980. In 2022, it was renamed Mundubbera State College.

The Mungar Junction to Monto railway line serviced the town from 1914.

A library was established in Mundubbera in December 1933 in the School of Arts.

The Mundubbera War Memorial commemorating those from the district who served in World War I was unveiled by the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Brisbane and Minister for Works, Mick Kirwan, on 27 May 1928.

Henry Zipf planted the first citrus orchards in 1933 and established Mundubbera as a major producer of export citrus. The recent (2006) drought and the aftereffects of the 2004 Citrus canker outbreak in Emerald has had a dampening effect of the citrus industry in the area.
The Mundubbera Vietnam Veterans Memorial commemorates those who served in the Vietnam War. It is located beside the RSL Memorial Hall.
On 11 November 1995, members of the RSL planted a Lone Pine war memorial tree from a seedling whose lineage links back to Gallipoli.

== Demographics ==
In the , the town of Mundubbera had a population of 1,053 people.

In the , the locality of Mundubbera had a population of 1,261 people.

In the , the locality of Mundubbera had a population of 1,120 people.

== Heritage listings ==
Mundubbera has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Mundubbera Butter Factory (also known as Maryborough Co-operative Dairy Association Butter Factory), 26 Bowen Road
*Mundubbera Cemetery, Kinchela Street
*O&#x27;Regan Memorial Gates, Leichhardt Street
*former Mundubbera Shire Hall and Bloxsome Memorial Building (also known as Mundubbera Library), Lyons Street
*Mundubbera War Memorial, intersection of Lyons and Bouverie Streets
*Jones Weir, Seligmann Avenue

==Economy==
The economy Mundubbera is predominantly agriculture and forestry. The major agricultural activities in Mundubbera are cattle grazing and, in the irrigated areas, fruit growing. Fruit grown in the Mundubbera area includes citrus, mangoes, avocadoes and stone fruit.
In addition, Mundubbera is Queensland&#x27;s largest producer of table grapes.

During the fruit picking seasons Mundubbera can double in size as many itinerant workers and backpackers from around the world come to the town looking for work on the orchards. Seasonal workers are accommodated in two large caravan parks in Mundubbera itself or in many on-site parks. Since 2010, workers from Tonga and Papua New Guinea have been supported through the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. The success of this endeavour has meant that the Seasonal Worker Program will be fully operational from 1 July 2012.

Supporting the fruit industry are businesses such as a fruit juice processor and several packing sheds. Bugs for Bugs, an integrated pest management business, raises insects in the old butter factory. These insects that act as a biological control for common fruit pests, reducing chemical insecticide use.

With large areas of State forest in the shire, Mundubbera also has a large timber industry with a mill in Mundubbera town. Other industries include piggeries and dairying. Commercial activity is limited and consists mainly of small businesses supporting local residents and farmers. The town has two hotels, two motels and an IGA supermarket, plus the usual small-town services such as a butcher, baker, newsagency, post office and a public library open to the general public.

==Transport==
The town is about south of the intersection of the Burnett Highway and the Mundubbera–Durong Road. The Burnett Highway links Mundubbera with Gayndah and Goomeri to the east; and Eidsvold, Monto and Biloela to the north. The Mundubbera-Durong links Mundubbera to Dalby and Toowoomba in the Darling Downs. This road is single lane bitumen in places. Public transport is limited. In 2005 the only public transport servicing Mundubbera was a bus service operating once a week on Thursdays to Bundaberg and on Wednesdays and Fridays to Maryborough. By 2022, the bus service to Bundaberg was thrice weekly and to Maryborough was once weekly.

In 2012 the Queensland Government under the Premiership of Campbell Newman announced that the railway line would no longer be looked after.

==Education==
Mundubbera State College is a government primary and secondary (Early Childhood to Year 10) school for boys and girls at 57 Bunce Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 242 students with 24 teachers (22 full-time equivalent) and 24 non-teaching staff (14 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. The school previously had a preschool but following the introduction of Prep, the preschool has been converted into a music room.

The nearest school offering secondary education to Year 12 is Burnett State College (formerly Gayndah State High School), to the east in Gayndah. Distance education and boarding schools are other options.

Other primary schools in the area include the small school cluster of the rural schools of Boynewood SS (opened 1915), Binjour Plateau SS (1913), Monogorilby SS (1936) and Riverleigh SS (1914); Riversleigh SS was closed at the end of 2009 due to lack of enrolment.

==Attractions==

While Mundubbera attracts seasonal workers from around the world, tourism remains relatively undeveloped. 

Some attractions include:

*The nearby Auburn River National Park is a good location to find Queensland Lungfish (&quot;Neoceratodus forsteri&quot;), known locally as Ceratodus, a rare living fossil found only in the Burnett and Mary Rivers. This park is popular with bush walkers and rock climbers. It features cascades, great swimming spots, caves, balancing rocks and superb scenery.
*The town lookout on the entrance to town on the Burnett Highway is home to a Black stump, to symbolise Mundubbera&#x27;s location on the edge of the Outback.
*The Big Mandarin, a larger-than-life fibreglass model of an Ellendale Mandarin doubles as a kiosk for a local caravan park. It is one of many &quot;Big&quot; tourist attractions that dot the Australian landscape.
*The &quot;Meeting Place of the Waters&quot; 360-degree mural painted on the sewerage pumping station is a visual tribute to the Boyne Auburn and Burnett Rivers that provide Mundubbera with its prosperity. 
*The Riverside Walk, Bicentennial Park and Railway Precinct are beside the Heritage listed Jones Weir.
*The Burnett River Bridges section of the Boyne Burnett Inland Rail Trail was opened in 2022 at Mt Debateable Railway Siding, Gayndah. Sixteen kilometres of it lies beside the Burnett River. The Red Gulley Bridge, Slab Creek Bridge, Spring Creek Bridge, Boomerang Bridge, Humphery Bridges Numbers 1, 2 (&quot;Faith&quot; Bridge or &quot;bridge of faith&quot;), and 3 and Roth&#x27;s Bridge are passed on the way to the other end at Mundubbera Railway Precinct. The Official Register of Engineering Heritage Markers listed the &quot;Degilbo-Mundubbera Railway Bridges&quot; in 2016. A total of 12 bridges, including some on this section of Rail Trail, are recognised with one Engineering Heritage Marker representing the “best example of a collection of historic railway bridges in Australia”.

<doc id="953810" wikidata="Q2686385" url="?curid=953810" title="Factitious disorder">
<text>A factitious disorder is a mental disorder in which a person, &quot;without&quot; a malingering motive, acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms, purely to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient&#x27;s role. People with a factitious disorder may produce symptoms by contaminating urine samples, taking hallucinogens, injecting fecal material to produce abscesses, and similar behaviour. The word &quot;factitious&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;factītius&quot;, meaning &quot;human-made&quot;.

Factitious disorder imposed on self (also called Munchausen syndrome) was for some time the umbrella term for all such disorders. Factitious disorder imposed on another (also called Munchausen syndrome by proxy, Munchausen by proxy, or factitious disorder by proxy) is a condition in which a person deliberately produces, feigns, or exaggerates the symptoms of someone in their care. In either case, the perpetrator&#x27;s motive is to perpetrate factitious disorders, either as a patient or by proxy as a caregiver, in order to attain (for themselves or for another) a patient&#x27;s role. Malingering differs fundamentally from factitious disorders in that the malingerer simulates illness intending to obtain a material benefit or avoid an obligation or responsibility. Somatic symptom disorders, though also diagnoses of exclusion, are characterized by physical complaints that are not produced intentionally.

==Etiology==
What causes factitious disorder is not well understood, however there is a handful of possible motives that drive this pattern of behavior. 

Individuals may experience a heightened thrill from medical procedures, a desire for attention and care, or feelings of control or accomplishment when deceiving medical professionals. They may partake in this behavior in order to seek and maintain relationships or use the sick-patient role as a coping strategy in response to stressful life events.

If an individual did not form a healthy attachment to a caregiver as a child, there is a possibility that the person may develop factitious disorder in order to fulfill the need of receiving care. Attention from medical professionals may act as a replacement in satisfying important needs that the person never received as a child. Individuals may also use invasive or painful tests or procedures as a way to punish oneself for past mistakes or to cope with guilt associated with abuse. This is considered masochistic behavior.

Individuals diagnosed with this disorder are more likely to have a history of emotional or physical abuse, neglect, and/or turbulent childhoods. This upbringing can cause an unstable sense of identity and low self-esteem. Abuse may prompt a feeling of lack of control, and the person may use faked symptoms and a fabricated medical history to gain back a sense of autonomy.

Those with factitious disorder are also more likely to have experienced a severe illness in childhood, with the early exposure to healthcare being a major contributor to the onset of the disorder.

There is a significant correlation found between the comorbidity of factitious disorder and personality disorders, specifically borderline personality disorder. Depressive disorders are also often diagnosed concurrently with factitious disorder. The causality cannot be known about whether one disorder causes the other, but it can be deduced that these diagnoses share similar etiologies and some overlapping symptoms.

Each particular case of factitious disorder presents itself differently and is derived from various etiologies. However, there is an overarching belief that patients experience the uncontrollable urge to maintain the sick-patient role, acting as a type of behavioral addiction. This contributes to the prolonged behaviors associated with the disorder.

==Diagnosis==
Criteria for diagnosis include intentionally fabricating to produce physical or psychological signs or symptoms and the absence of any other mental disorder. Motivation for their behavior must be to assume the &quot;sick&quot; role, and they do not act sick for personal gain as in the case of malingering sentiments. When the individual applies this pretended sickness to a dependent, for example, a child, it is often referred to as &quot;factitious disorder by proxy&quot;.

The DSM-5 differentiates among two types:
*Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)
*Factitious disorder imposed on another (Munchausen syndrome by proxy), defined as: When an individual falsifies illness in another, whether that be a child, pet, or older adult.

===Factitious disorder imposed on self===
Factitious disorder imposed on self, previously called Munchausen syndrome, or factitious disorder with predominantly physical signs and symptoms, has specified symptoms. Factitious disorder symptoms may seem exaggerated; individuals undergo major surgery repeatedly, and they &quot;hospital jump&quot; or migrate to avoid detection.

===Factitious disorder imposed on another===

Factitious disorder imposed on another, previously Munchausen syndrome by , is the involuntary use of another individual to play the patient role. This disorder is relatively rare. False symptoms have been produced in children by perpetrator caregivers or parents. Less frequently they are produced in one adult by another adult. The disorder produces the &quot;appearance&quot; of illness, which &quot;appearance&quot; may be augmented by the perpetrator by providing an intentionally misleading medical history, or even by tampering with laboratory tests to make the targeted individual appear sick. 

Occasionally in cases of this disorder, caregivers have been known to actually injure a child or to medically harm another adult in order to ensure that the targeted individual is medically treated. For instance, a mother whose son has celiac disease might knowingly introduce gluten into the son&#x27;s diet. Such parents may be validated by the attention that they receive from having a sick child. When the disorder occurs between adults, a perpetrator may gain sympathy for their supposedly &quot;heroic efforts&quot; to care for the other targeted adult. For example a wife has been found to have induced a &quot;manufactured&quot; illness in her husband via the surreptitious injection of a harmful substance into her husband.

===Ganser syndrome===
Ganser syndrome was once considered a separate factitious disorder, but is now considered a dissociative disorder. It is a disorder of extreme stress or an organic condition. The patient experiences approximation or giving absurd answers to simple questions. The syndrome is sometimes diagnosed as merely malingering—however, it is more often defined as a factitious disorder. This has been seen in prisoners following solitary confinement, and the symptoms are consistent in different prisons, though the patients do not know one another.

Symptoms include a clouding of consciousness, somatic conversion symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, echolalia, and echopraxia. Individuals also give approximate answers to simple questions such as, &quot;How many legs on a cat?&quot; &quot;Three&quot;; &quot;What&#x27;s the day after Wednesday?&quot; &quot;Friday&quot;; and so on. The disorder is extraordinarily rare with fewer than 100 recorded cases. While individuals of all backgrounds have been reported with the disorder, there is a higher inclination towards males (75% or more). The average age of those with Ganser syndrome is 32, though it stretches from ages 15–62 years old.

===Differential diagnosis===
Factitious disorder should be distinguished from somatic symptom disorder (formerly called somatization disorder), in which the patient is truly experiencing the symptoms and has no intention to deceive.
In conversion disorder (previously called hysteria), a neurological deficit appears with no organic cause. The patient, again, is truly experiencing the symptoms and signs and has no intention to deceive.
The differential also includes body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorder.

==Treatment==
No true psychiatric medications are prescribed for factitious disorder. However, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can help manage underlying problems. Medicines such as SSRIs that are used to treat mood disorders can be used to treat factitious disorder, as a mood disorder may be the underlying cause of factitious disorder. Some authors (such as Prior and Gordon 1997) also report good responses to antipsychotic drugs such as Pimozide. Family therapy can also help. In such therapy, families are helped to better understand patients (the individual in the family with factitious disorder) and that person&#x27;s need for attention.

In this therapeutic setting, the family is urged not to condone or reward the factitious disorder individual&#x27;s behavior. This form of treatment can be unsuccessful if the family is uncooperative or displays signs of denial and/or antisocial disorder. Psychotherapy is another method used to treat the disorder. These sessions should focus on the psychiatrist&#x27;s establishing and maintaining a relationship with the patient. Such a relationship may help to contain symptoms of factitious disorder. Monitoring is also a form that may be indicated for the factitious disorder patient&#x27;s own good; factitious disorder (especially proxy) can be detrimental to an individual&#x27;s health—if they are, in fact, causing true physiological illnesses. Even faked illnesses and injuries can be dangerous and might be monitored for fear that unnecessary surgery may subsequently be performed.

==Prognosis==
Some individuals experience only a few outbreaks of the disorder. However, in most cases, factitious disorder is a chronic long-term condition that is difficult to treat. There are relatively few positive outcomes for this disorder; in fact, treatment provided a lower percentage of positive outcomes than did the treatment of individuals with obvious psychotic symptoms such as people with schizophrenia. In addition, many individuals with factitious disorder do not present for treatment, often insisting their symptoms are genuine. Some degree of recovery, however, is possible. The passage of time seems to help the disorder greatly. There are many possible explanations for this occurrence, although none are currently considered definitive. It may be that a factitious disorder individual has mastered the art of feigning sickness over so many years of practice that the disorder can no longer be discerned. Another hypothesis is that many times a factitious disorder individual is placed in a home, or experiences health issues that are not self-induced or feigned. In this way, the problem with obtaining the &quot;patient&quot; status is resolved because symptoms arise without any effort on the part of the individual.

==History==
Previously, the DSM-IV differentiated among three types:
*Factitious disorders with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms: if psychological signs and symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation
*Factitious disorders with predominantly physical signs and symptoms: if physical signs and symptoms predominate in the clinical presentation
*Factitious disorders with combined psychological and physical signs and symptoms: if both psychological and physical signs and symptoms are present and neither predominates in the clinical presentation

<text>The Hamilton Street Railway (HSR) is the public transport agency for Hamilton, Ontario. The name is a legacy of the company&#x27;s early period, when public transit in Hamilton was primarily served by streetcars. Although streetcars are no longer used in the city today, the HSR operates bus and paratransit services, with a ridership of 21 million passengers a year.
==History==

===Ownership===
On March 29, 1873, the HSR was established after Ontario passed &quot;An Act to incorporate &quot;The Hamilton Street Railway Company.&quot;&quot; It was owned by Lyman Moore and operated as a private business under a city franchise. In 1899, HSR was bought out by the Hamilton Cataract, Power, Light and Traction Company, later known as Dominion Power and Transmission Company. In April 1930, HSR was acquired by Ontario Hydro. Provincial ownership ended in 1946 when HSR became a subsidiary of Canada Coach Lines. Through a corporate reorganization in 1954, CCL became a subsidiary of HSR. HSR and CCL were purchased by the city of Hamilton in 1960. CCL was sold to Trentway-Wagar in 1993. In 1977, the Hamilton-Wentworth Region assumed ownership of HSR. In 2001, regional amalgamation placed ownership back with the city of Hamilton.

===Former streetcar system===

The HSR operated horsecars from 1874 to 1892. In May 1874, the first horsecar ran south on James Street, then east on King Street to Wellington Street, a distance of . At the end of horsecar operation, there were 5 horsecar routes, of track, 45 horsecars, 9 sleighs and 160 horses. Fifteen of the horsecars would be converted into electric streetcars. The horsecar system had three barns: North Barn at Stuart and Bay Streets, East Barn at Sanford Avenue and King Street (built 1890) and South Barn at Herkimer and Locke Streets (built 1891). These three locations would continue to be used after electrification. On June 29, 1892, the first electric streetcars went into operation. 

In 1895, York Street was mostly double-tracked. In 1896, the first streetcar loop was constructed at Guise Street at the north end of James Street. In 1904, HSR provided rush-hour service north from Barton Street over the tracks of the Hamilton Radial Electric Railway (HRER) along Birch Avenue. In 1907, the , single-track, side-of-road Bartonville line was built east from Sherman Avenue along King Street East to Strongman Road. Barton Street was double-tracked in 1911. Tracks were extended east along Burlington Street from James Street (1910 and 1913), linking to the double-track HRER line at Birch Avenue. By 1916, tracks had been extended east on Barton Street, north and south on Kennilworth Avenue and west on Main Street; an enlarged Belt Line was created in October 1916 using the new double track and became the city&#x27;s busiest streetcar line. By 1923, the tracks had been extended west along King Street to Cline Avenue in Westdale. After the Hamilton and Dundas Street Railway ceased operation in 1923, HSR took over a portion of its line along Aberdeen Avenue to Longwood Road.

In 1908, the South Barn was destroyed by fire after which the site continued to be used streetcar storage. In 1910, the Sanford Barn was opened near north-west corner of King and Sanford Streets, across the street from the East Barn. In 1928, new shops were opened near the East Barn to maintain streetcars and interurban cars. In 1929, the North Barn closed.

The HSR had a mixed fleet of single-end and double-end streetcars. Single-end streetcars were used on the Belt Line where no loops were required. In 1927, turning loops were added at the outer ends of the Aberdeen and Westdale lines.

Bus service was introduced in 1926 along Cannon Street. The first contraction of the streetcar system was the closure of the single-track line to Bartonville, replaced by buses in 1929. The first major streetcar abandonment was along York Street on 1939.

By 1940, the HSR operated the following seven routes:
After Canada Coach Lines purchased HSR in 1946, it announced the abandonment of streetcar service. Consequently, service was abandoned on Aberdeen Avenue in 1947, to Westdale in 1949 and on Burlington Street in 1950. The final abandonment was the Belt Line with April 5, 1951 being its last day of service, but with a ceremonial last run on the following day.

===Former interurban lines===
Hamilton had four interurban lines originating from downtown Hamilton. These lines were not part of the HSR but for many of their years of operation had the same parent company, Dominion Power and Transmission Company. In order to access downtown Hamilton, the interurbans shared some trackage with the HSR.

From 1907, interurban cars ran out of a Hamilton Terminal Station located between Main and King Streets East at Catherine Street. The passenger terminal with several tracks was east of Catherine Street and a two-track interurban freight station was on that street&#x27;s west side. In 1924, buses of Dominion Power subsidiaries started using the terminal, but loaded on Main Street. After interurbans were abandoned, the passenger station was renovated for buses. The station closed in 1955, and was later demolished. Today, its site is occupied by Terminal Towers.
===Former trolley bus system===

Trolley buses were used by the HSR from 1950 to 1992. The trolley bus system opened on December 10, 1950, and the last day of trolley bus service was December 30, 1992.

On December 10, 1950, the first Hamilton trolley buses went into service on the Cannon route, replacing a busy bus route. In October 1951, several months after the termination of streetcar service, a second trolley bus route went into service as the King-Barton route. In 1956, the city introduced one-way streets in downtown Hamilton; as a result, the King-Barton route was split into the separate King and Barton routes. Trolley bus operation was eventually extended as far east as Donn Avenue in Stoney Creek. Trolley buses operated out of the Sanford facility which used to handle streetcars. Originally designated only by names, as in streetcar days, the three routes were later given numbers, 1 for the King route, 2 for Barton, and 3 for the Cannon route. The fleet originally consisted of 50 Canadian Car–Brill vehicles, which by 1973 were replaced by 40 Flyer E700 trolley buses built in 1972–73. Sixteen Flyer E800A vehicles were added in 1978–79. All 56 Flyer trolley buses used some electrical components, such as motors, from retired Brill trolley buses, but that in the E800s came not from HSR Brills but from Brills of the Thunder Bay trolley bus system (closed in 1972), purchased by HSR for the parts.
In the mid-1980s, the older Flyer trolley buses were nearing the end of their useful life, given that their electrical equipment had been recycled from 1950 trolley buses. HSR noted that new diesel buses were cheaper to buy than new trolley buses. However, in November 1986, the city council and Hamilton–Wentworth Regional Council both voted in favour of retaining trolley bus operation and endorsing buying new trolley buses, and small investments in new infrastructure were still being made, such as the construction of a new turnaround loop for trolley buses at Eastgate Square mall, which came into use in September 1986. However, temporary substitutions of diesel buses for trolley buses became increasingly common in the late 1980s. Diesel buses temporarily replaced trolley buses on routes 1–King and 3-Cannon in May 1989 because of road construction projects, with trolley buses returning to both routes in November 1989. However, both routes were again dieselized in early January 1990 for what would ultimately be the last time. Only route 2–Barton then remained in operation with trolley buses.

At the time the King and Cannon routes were dieselized, the city moved trolley bus operations to a new bus garage at 330 Wentworth Street North which did not have trolley wires. This was possible because all but one of HSR&#x27;s 16 newer trolley buses (model E800A) had been retrofitted in 1989–90 with a small auxiliary diesel engine for off-wire movements. The last day for trolley bus operation on the Barton route was December 30, 1992, when only a single trolley bus (No. 7815) was in service. At the time, the regional council was still planning to purchase new trolleybuses for routes 1 and 2, and HSR issued a draft specification for new trolley buses in April 1993, and subsequently, considered purchasing or leasing 40 trolley buses from the Edmonton trolley bus system that had been on loan to the Toronto Transit Commission since 1989–90 and were in storage in Toronto after the 1993 closure of the trolley bus system there. However, after HSR concluded that the Edmonton vehicles would require costly modifications for Hamilton, the regional council voted on March 1, 1994 to make the system&#x27;s closure permanent.

=== Barns/garages ===

HSR is proposing to build a new garage at the site of the former Wentworth Street Transit Centre. The garage would hold 200 natural-gas buses and have 30 repair bays, a bus wash facility and offices. In January 2023, HSR posted bid documents; it hopes to open the new facility in 2024 to supplement the overcrowded Mountain Transit Centre.

== Services ==

=== Bus routes ===
Most bus routes in Hamilton operate all of the week, from early morning to late at a night, or past midnight. Headways mostly range from between 6 and 30 minutes, and most routes being 20 minutes or better on weekdays, usually between 12 and 20 minutes frequencies, depending on time of day.

On weekends, frequencies are reduced, and services are usually altered or unavailable on holidays.

There are some special bus routes that only operate during certains times of year, enter Burlington, or otherwise operate in different ways from the majority of routes.

=== Trans-Cab ===
Introduced in 1998 as a two-year pilot project, Trans-Cab is a shared-ride taxi service between HSR and specific local taxi providers, currently offered in portions of Glanbrook and Stoney Creek.

=== Accessible transportation ===
Accessible Transportation Services (ATS) is the section that administers a variety of accessible services on behalf of the City
* Accessible low-floor (ALF) buses provide level entry and exit to accommodate wheelchairs and walkers. It is anticipated that the entire HSR fleet will be accessible by 2009.
* Disabled and Aged Regional Transportation System (DARTS) is a non profit charitable organization that is the paratransit service provider.
* Taxi Scrip program provides discounted taxi coupons for ATS registered persons who are unable to access regular transit buses.

=== Mountain Climber ===

In 2017, HSR launched a program called &quot;Mountain Climber,&quot; that allows cyclists ride on the bus to get up and down Hamilton Mountain for free. This program was made permanent in 2018 and has since been expanded to include more stops.

Participating bus stops are located along major roads at the base and crest of the escarpment. People with bicycles load them onto the bus&#x27; front rack, and when boarding, tell the bus operator they are riding under Mountain Climber for free. The routes are very limited in length, and provide a safe way for cyclists to ascend or descend the mountain, in order to encourage active transportation.

=== Rapid transit ===
Metrolinx, the provincial public transit agency, is planning a light rail line along the Main/King corridor from McMaster University to Eastgate Square. The line will have 17 stops. Previously known as the B-Line, it is one of five BRT/LRT lines originating from the BLAST network proposal, and the only one in active planning. , the operator of the future line is unknown and might not be HSR. For example, Keolis will operate and maintain the Hurontario LRT, another Metrolinx project, even though the local public transit operator in Mississauga is MiWay.

== (Re)envision the HSR ==
In 2023, a concept plan to prepare the bus routes in the city for the addition of the Hamilton LRT project was presented. This plan was intended to feed LRT ridership, and the HSR will use this operations plan when the LRT is operational.

== Terminals and connections ==
HSR routes from downtown to the Mountain (21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, and 35) currently use the Frank A. Cooke Transit Terminal (former MacNab Transit Terminal), while several lower city routes (4, 6, 7, 8 and 9) have an on-street terminal layover at the intersection of Main and James Streets. Route 34 has a layover location on Main at MacNab.

On September 4, 2022, the City of Hamilton renamed the MacNab Transit Terminal to Frank A. Cooke Transit Terminal to honour an employee of the HSR that retired as a general manager and died at the age of 100. The terminal is located at 1 MacNab Street South and was opened in 2011. It serves 10 bus routes with 7,250 weekly arrivals and departures in 2022. The wheelchair accessible terminal has heated platforms, bus shelters, public washrooms and a green roof.&lt;ref name=&quot;TT-2022/08/20&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
HSR connects with GO Transit at Hamilton GO Centre, which serves as the terminus for four HSR routes (1, 2, 3, and 51). The station, located at 36 Hunter Street East, a few blocks south of King and James, is the terminus of the Lakeshore West railway line and express Highway 407 and Queen Elizabeth Way GO Buses. It is also the former home of the main Greyhound Lines bus stop, prior to Greyhound Canada&#x27;s Canada-wide closure in 2021. It is also the former Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (TH&amp;B) passenger station, and there is a small museum above the public concourse. HSR routes 2 and 4 also connect with GO at Barton Street &amp; Nash Road in East Hamilton, where a GO bus travels between there and the Burlington GO Station.

At the Mountain Transit Centre transfer point (served by route 27) and a contract with Blue Line Taxi, the HSR also connects with other areas in the northwest portion of the former Glanbrook.

In addition, the HSR is connected with Burlington Transit, as one route (11 Parkdale) travels into Burlington via Burlington Beach, 18 Waterdown connects with BT at Aldershot GO Station, and BT Route 1 enters downtown Hamilton from Plains Road West. Also &#x27;9 Rock Gardens&#x27; travels into Burlington going into the Royal Botanical Gardens during the summer months.

=== Other terminals and loops ===

==Fares==
HSR fares can be paid with exact cash (no change given), Presto card or the mobile Presto e-tickets app. Starting in 2023, riders could tap their credit or debit card on the Presto reader to pay the cash fare amount.

A single-ride fare provides a 2 hour transfer window which allows customers to get on and off HSR buses as many times as they want on a single fare.

Children ages 0 to 5 years old can ride fare-free when travelling with an accompanying paying adult. Children ages 6 to 12 and Hamilton senior residents aged 80 and over can ride fare-free only when travelling with a valid Presto card, for those who do not have a Presto card, they are required to pay a regular fare. 

==Staff==
HSR bus drivers and mechanics (800 employees as of 2019) are members of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 107. The local does not represent those working on city&#x27;s paratransit service, Disabled and Aged Regional Transportation System (DARTS), which is a separate, non-profit charitable organization that contracts with HSR.

=== 2023 strike ===

After regular collective bargaining talks broke down, ATU Local 107 workers went on strike at 12 am on November 9, 2023. The union cited wage increases that did not keep up with the rate of inflation in a handout given to passengers in the days proceeding the job action. The strike came as the city was preparing and hosting festivities for the 110th Grey Cup, for which HSR had been planning to run a shuttle service for fans. The transit union said that any shuttle service would be considered as using scab labour and would be targeted by picket lines. In the early hours of November 16, Mayor Andrea Horwath announced that a deal had been made and that there would be a return to regular service on November 17, 2023. The new 4-year contract was ratified by Local 107 members on November 23 with 81% voting in favour of the deal that in lieu of a changed wage offer, gave transit workers a one-time payment as well as benefit increases.

<doc id="953817" wikidata="Q2962638" url="?curid=953817" title="Cheney Stadium">
<text>Cheney Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium located in Tacoma, Washington, United States. It is primarily used for baseball and is home to the Tacoma Rainiers of the minor league Pacific Coast League. The stadium also hosted professional soccer teams, including the Tacoma Defiance of the USL Championship until 2022 and OL Reign of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League until 2021. Cheney Stadium opened in 1960 and has a capacity of 6,500 seats. It is next to Henry Foss High School, and the stadium has an agreement with the school to use the school parking lot for parking.

==History==
Cheney Stadium is named for Ben Cheney, a local businessman who worked to bring minor league baseball to Tacoma and also was put in control of the project. Cheney Stadium was constructed in 42 working days after the San Francisco Giants had committed to moving their Triple-A affiliate from Phoenix if the city could open the stadium for the beginning of the 1960 season. Construction included light towers and wooden grandstand seats from Seals Stadium in San Francisco. Several of the wooden grandstand seats are still in place today.

Cheney Stadium has been home to Pacific Coast League baseball continuously since 1960, in the form of seven teams: the Tacoma Giants (1960–65), Cubs (1966–71), Twins (1972–77), Yankees (1978), Tugs (1979), Tigers (A&#x27;s) (1980–94), and the Rainiers (Mariners) (1995–present).

Notable players who played in Cheney Stadium include Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry, Reggie Jackson and Ken Griffey Jr., as well as Tom Kelly, Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire, Jason Giambi, Félix Hernández, Cliff Lee and Alex Rodriguez.

The stadium hosted the baseball competition of the 1990 Goodwill Games and hosted the 30th annual Triple-A All-Star Game on July 12, 2017.

It was the Seattle Mariners&#x27; alternate training site in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the Minor League Baseball campaign and the abbreviation of the Major League Baseball season. The Mariners had previously considered Cheney Stadium for use during the 1994 season after the Kingdome was closed for emergency repairs.

===2011 renovation===
On November 11, 2009, it was announced the City of Tacoma was considering a $30 million renovation to Cheney Stadium. Early renovation plans included a new grandstand superstructure, roof and concourse, as well as new concession stands, seats, luxury suites and a restaurant. The proposal drew little controversy from taxpayers.

On November 19, 2009, the Tacoma Rainiers renewed their lease with the City of Tacoma to keep playing at Cheney Stadium for 32 years. The deal relied on the renovation proposal getting passed. The proposal, now said to be $28 million in cost, was approved on November 25, 2009. The approval means the Rainiers will continue to play in Tacoma until at least 2041, and renovations were completed before the 2011 season. The renovations included basic repairs, 16 luxury suites, a kids&#x27; &quot;play area&quot;, more restrooms and concession stands, and a new restaurant.

==Soccer==

The reserve team of Seattle Sounders FC of Major League Soccer, known at the time as Seattle Sounders FC 2, played in Cheney Stadium from 2018 to 2021. The team rebranded as the Tacoma Defiance in 2019, but maintained the Sounders affiliation. The club, along with the OL Reign, then known as Reign FC, of the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League originally planned to build their own soccer-specific stadium in a nearby parking lot, with assistance from the Rainiers, and had aimed to open the new stadium in 2021. After the 2021 season, Major League Baseball tightened restrictions on alternate uses of their fields and both teams found new locations. Reign moved their home matches to Lumen Field beginning with the 2022 season. The Tacoma Defiance currently play at Starfire Stadium.

The Sounders played one U.S. Open Cup match at Cheney Stadium on June 12, 2019, which ended as a 2–1 loss to the Portland Timbers. 6,280 spectators attended the match.

<text>PSR B1829−10 (often shortened to PSR 1829−10) is a pulsar that is approximately 30,000 light-years away in the constellation of Scutum. This pulsar has been the target of interest, because of a mistaken identification of a planet around it. Andrew G. Lyne of the University of Manchester and Bailes claimed in July 1991 to have found &quot;a planet orbiting the neutron star PSR 1829-10&quot; but in 1992 retracted. They had failed to correctly take into account the ellipticity of Earth&#x27;s orbit, and had incorrectly concluded that a planet with an orbital period of half a year existed around the pulsar.

<doc id="953828" wikidata="Q5877300" url="?curid=953828" title="Hoggs Hollow">
<text>Hoggs Hollow is a residential neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located to the south of York Mills Road, east of Yonge Street, and the western branch of the upper Don River flows through it.

Hoggs Hollow is named after the Hogg family. James Hogg (1797–1839), a Scotsman, settled in the area in 1824. He operated a whisky distillery and a grist mill, and he was viewed as the most successful of all the millers in the valley. The name of the neighbourhood is usually written without an apostrophe as Hoggs Hollow, but it sometimes appears with an apostrophe as Hogg&#x27;s Hollow.

==History==

In 1856, John and William Hogg, sons of James Hogg, subdivided their father&#x27;s estate under the name &quot;Hoggs Hollow&quot;. The subdivision included one hundred and forty-one lots. With the area full of quick sand, swamps and bogs, only a few houses were actually built at this time, however Sebastian and Carson were among the first settlers to arrive in Hoggs Hollow with the Hogg family. The subdivision stood in close proximity to the historic village of York Mills. A school, post office, pottery, blacksmith, livery, stable, store, golf links and clubhouse, hillside cemetery (at Yonge Street and Mill Street) and St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church served the community, one largely made up of Scottish, Irish and English immigrants.

In 1805 Cornelius van Nostrand and his large family, settled in this area to farm. He was the first Canadian van Nostrand and played a significant role in the building of the nearby St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church, where a large family monument is situated. The family went on to operate a grist mill and distillery.

Development of the present-day Hoggs Hollow neighbourhood began during the 1920s with the creation of lots, layout of roads, and design of homes reflecting the aesthetic of the English countryside. In 1925, a two-room elementary schoolhouse named the Baron Renfrew School opened to replace an earlier structure at 45 York Mills Road (formerly Mercer Avenue and/or concession road 19) that was destroyed by fire. In 1929, the Loretto Sisters Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary moved their Motherhouse and Loretto Abbey Catholic Secondary School to the area.

The neighbourhood grew in stages and was finally completed during the 1960s. Both St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church and Baron Renfrew School (renamed to York Mills Public School) grew in size, with various additions. Agricola Finnish Lutheran Church was built in 1967, serving Toronto and area&#x27;s Finnish Lutheran community.

In 1982, York Mills Public School was decommissioned and renovated as office space for the Metro Toronto school board (used until 1998). The historic two-room schoolhouse exterior was restored. The school was demolished in 2004, and bricks from it were used to create a memorial.

The Miller Tavern (formerly the Jolly Miller Tavern), c. 1857, located at the bottom of Hoggs Hollow Hill, 3885 Yonge Street, was closed for many years, but re-opened in 2004 after many battles between developers, the city and groups that wanted to preserve the historical landmark. The George S. Pratt House, c. 1886, located at 17 Mill Street, is another historic landmark in Hoggs Hollow. In need of funds, The York Mills Public School building was sold by the school board and demolished. Many of the original estate homes and modern movement residences of the early to mid-20th century are being demolished in favour of large new homes. With a densely developed business area, many businesses and services are available, and while church attendance has diminished at St. John&#x27;s, other churches and synagogues now serve the people of the area.

Periodically, attempts have been made to reconnect portions of the valley with new roads to the higher-set neighbourhoods of the ridges above.

==Public transportation==
In 1892, the Metropolitan Street Railway extended streetcar service along Yonge Street from Toronto (Summerhill) to the southern rim of Hoggs Hollow near today&#x27;s Glen Echo Road, and then through the valley to Richmond Hill in 1897. This radial railway service through the valley ended in 1948. However, the Yonge streetcar line continued to operate service from Glen Echo Road to downtown Toronto until 1954. Since 1973, Hoggs Hollow has been served by York Mills subway station.

==Disasters==
On October 15, 1954, the valley was inundated by Hurricane Hazel, and many attempts have since been made to manage water in the natural watershed of a valley, though many homes are still prone to moisture and flooding from the water table. A steel truss bridge carrying Yonge Street across the river was damaged and temporarily replaced by a Bailey bridge until a new bridge was built.

On March 17, 1960, the incident popularly known as the &quot;Hoggs Hollow Disaster&quot; occurred. Five young Italian immigrant workers were killed while constructing a tunnel for a water main at Hoggs Hollow. The details of the accident, where they were trapped 35 feet underground in a cramped, dimly lit tunnel, sparked a public outcry over the lack of safety standards in construction. Ultimately, the outcry led to an improvement in working conditions, such as the passing of the Industrial Safety Act.

Bates was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of Nora (Jennings) and Representative George J. Bates of the , who also served as Salem&#x27;s mayor. He attended local schools and graduated from Worcester Academy in 1936. He received his undergraduate education at Brown University, Providence, R.I., graduating in 1940. Following graduation from Brown, he enlisted in the United States Navy in July 1940 and was commissioned as ensign in the Naval Reserve on January 30, 1941. Bates then received instruction at the Naval Reserve Supply Officer&#x27;s School at the Naval Medical Center, Washington, D.C., before serving successive tours of duty at the Washington Navy Yard and in &quot;Constellation&quot; (IX-20).

He remained a naval reservist, and by 1949 had become the supply officer for the 4th Naval District. While Bates was stationed there, his father was killed in a plane crash at the Washington National Airport on November 1, 1949.

Bates resigned his reserve commission — he had attained the rank of lieutenant commander by that time — on February 14, 1950, to fill the seat of his late father in the United States House of Representatives. For nearly two decades, until his death in 1969, Bates staunchly advocated a strong military posture for the United States. On the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy and the House Armed Services Committee, he vigorously supported the development of nuclear-powered naval vessels. He also vigorously backed incentive pay programs and the establishment of better housing facilities for servicemen. He constantly sought means to enhance the training, caliber, and morale of military personnel. Bates voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Bates died of stomach cancer on June 22, 1969. Immediately upon his death, the U.S. Navy attack submarine , originally planned to be named USS &quot;Redfish&quot;, was renamed in his honor before her construction began.

The Bates Bridge, which crosses the Merrimack River between Groveland and Haverhill, Massachusetts, is named in his honor.

His great-nephew is comedian John Mulaney, whose maternal grandmother is Bates&#x27; sister.

<text>USS &quot;William H. Bates&quot; (SSN-680), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was planned to be the second U.S. Navy ship to be named USS &quot;Redfish&quot;—for the redfish, a variety of salmon —when the contract to build her was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 25 June 1968. However, upon the 22 June 1969 death of William H. Bates (1917–1969), the U.S. representative from Massachusetts&#x27;s 6th congressional district (1950–1969) known for his staunch support of nuclear propulsion in the U.S. Navy, she was renamed &quot;William H. Bates&quot; and was laid down on 4 August 1969 as the only ship of the U.S. Navy to have borne the name. The reason for her naming by then-Secretary of the Navy John Chafee, breaking with a long-standing Navy tradition of naming U.S. Navy attack submarines for sea creatures, was best summed up by Admiral Hyman Rickover, the then-director of the Navy&#x27;s nuclear reactors program, with the pithy comment that, &quot;Fish don&#x27;t vote!&quot;

==Construction and commissioning==

The contract to build &quot;Redfish&quot; was awarded on 25 June 1968, and she had been renamed &quot;William H. Bates&quot; by the time her keel was laid on 4 August 1969 by Ingalls Shipbuilding. She was launched on 11 December 1971, sponsored by Mrs. Andrew R. Grainger, and commissioned on 5 May 1973.

==Service history==

===1973–1979===
After shakedown, &quot;William H. Bates&quot; arrived at her home port, New London, Connecticut. She was deployed to the eastern Atlantic Ocean between July and October 1974 and conducted her first patrol mission before visiting Holy Loch, Scotland, and Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, on her way home. However, her respite was brief, for she was again underway on patrol by the latter part of December 1974 and into January 1975. After voyage repairs at Holy Loch, she called at Faslane, Scotland, for a port visit.

Departing Faslane for home in late January 1974, &quot;William H. Bates&quot; underwent a refit at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, before conducting local operations off Fort Lauderdale, Florida, into the summer of 1975. She was deployed to European waters again soon thereafter, taking part in antisubmarine warfare exercises. In November 1975, she took part in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercises &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;Ocean Safari &#x27;75,&quot; before she returned to New London in December 1975.

&quot;William H. Bates&quot; conducted her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in 1976, departing New London on 5 May 1976. During this tour, she honed her skills in exercises with other ships of the U.S. Navy and NATO naval units of foreign countries. During the deployment, she visited Bizerte, Tunisia; Augusta Bay, Sicily; and La Spezia and Naples, Italy. After departing the Mediterranean Sea on 6 September 1976, she took part in exercise &quot;Ocean Safari &#x27;76&quot; in mid-month. On 14 October 1976, she returned to New London.

&quot;William H. Bates&quot; underwent voyage repairs and later prepared for another overseas deployment. She departed New London during the summer of 1977 and completed her assigned mission on 3 October 1977, mooring alongside the submarine tender that day. She subsequently transited the North Sea for a port visit to Bremerhaven, West Germany, where she spent five days. She then took part in exercise &quot;Ocean Safari &#x27;77&quot; with NATO units while returning from European waters to New London.

&quot;William H. Bates&quot; operated in the Atlantic into early 1978 until moving to a new home port, San Diego, California, in May 1978 for service in the United States Pacific Fleet.

===1978–1989===
From 1978 through early 1989, &quot;William H. Bates&quot; operated from San Diego while attached to Submarine Squadron 11, conducting numerous Western Pacific deployments and operations, such as &quot;Exercise Team Spirit&quot; with the Republic of Korea Navy and the navies of various other countries. During her deployments, she conducted port visits at Subic Bay in the Philippines, at Chinhae in South Korea, at Yokosuka and Sasebo in Japan, at Guam, and at Satahip in Thailand, among other places.

In mid-1989, &quot;William H. Bates&quot; transited northward from San Diego, stopped at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California, for minor repairs and to allow her crew to rest, and then continued up the United States West Coast and entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, for an extensive refueling overhaul and retrofit.

===1991–2000===
In 1991, after completion of the refueling overhaul, &quot;William H. Bates&quot;″ homeport was changed to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in April, 1991 and assigned to Submarine Squadron 1, from which she completed several Western Pacific deployments and operations during the 1990s, including fit-up of Dry Deck Shelter 06-P in December 1991, a 6-month Western Pacific deployment 18 June-18 December 1992 including port visits in Guam, Yokosuka, and Hong Kong, a 56-day deployment to the Western Pacific 23 June-18 August 1993 which included participation in Exercise Tandem Thrust &#x27;93, a port visit in Brisbane, and a Golden Shellback simultaneous crossing of the Equator and International Dateline on 13 August 1993.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;William H. Bates&quot; was decommissioned and simultaneously stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 February 2000. She returned to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program began on 1 October 2002 and was completed on 30 October 2002.

<doc id="953851" wikidata="Q888924" url="?curid=953851" title="Carl Sanders">
<text>Carl Edward Sanders Sr. (May 15, 1925 – November 16, 2014) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 74th governor of Georgia from 1963 to 1967.

==Early life and education==
Carl Sanders was born on May 15, 1925, in Augusta, Georgia, United States to a middle class family. He later stated that he had &quot;an exceptionally happy and secure childhood.&quot; He attended the Academy of Richmond County, where he performed well academically and played on the school football team. He was made an alternate appointee to the United States Military Academy, but when the primary appointee claimed the spot Sanders accepted a football scholarship and enrolled at the University of Georgia in 1942. He played as a left-handed quarterback on the freshman football team.

While Sanders was at college, the United States entered World War II, and in 1943 he left his studies and joined the United States Army Air Forces. He was commissioned as a lieutenant and piloted B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft. He named his own bomber &quot;Georgia Peach&quot;, but was never deployed overseas. After the war he returned to the University of Georgia to complete his studies. He studied law, passing the bar examination in early 1947 and finishing his courses in December. He played with the Georgia Bulldogs and went to the Oil Bowl. He was a member of the Chi Phi fraternity, the Phi Kappa Literary Society, and the school debate team. On September 6, 1947, he married Betty Foy, an art student he had met at the university. They had two children together. Sanders started practicing law in Augusta with Henry Hammond before establishing his own practice with several other partners. He devoted a significant amount of time to practice early on to pay off medical debt after his wife fell ill.

==Legislative career==
Sanders garnered an interest in politics from his father, who had served on the Richmond County Board of Commissioners. In 1954, Sanders won a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives, successfully defeating a &quot;Cracker Party&quot; candidate. Two years later he was elected to the Georgia State Senate. At the time, a rotation agreement meant the seat was typically held in successive fashion by a denizen of Richmond County, of Jefferson County, and of Glascock County. He was re-elected in 1958 and 1960, making him the only person to ever serve three consecutive terms from a multi-county Georgia senatorial constituency while the rotation agreements were in use.

In 1958 Sanders chaired a Senate committee which investigated potential corruption in the Rural Roads Authority during Governor Marvin Griffin&#x27;s tenure. The committee found that the authority spent too much money on construction projects, located new roads without proper consideration, and was ineffective at maintaining existing roads. It recommended that the agency be dissolved and that future rural road projects be allocated based on population density, all financed with a pay-as-you-go system. Lieutenant Governor Ernest Vandiver became political allies with Sanders as a result of his committee work and made him Senate floor leader in 1959. Vandiver became governor, and that year a federal judge ordered the Atlanta Board of Education to draft a plan to racially desegregate schools. Vandiver called 60 people to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion to discuss either proceeding with desegregation or closing the schools. Only Sanders and House floor leader Frank Twitty advised desegregation, the former fearing that suspending schools &quot;would have created a generation of illiterates.&quot; Vandiver ultimately had schools closed only temporarily while the Georgia General Assembly revised state segregation statutes. He opposed a proposal to make the school issue subject to a statewide referendum. With the governor&#x27;s support, Sanders was elected president pro tempore of the Senate on February 20, 1959, after Robert H. Jordan&#x27;s resignation, and served in that position during the chamber&#x27;s 1960 and 1962 regular sessions.

== Gubernatorial career ==
=== 1962 election ===

Sanders decided to make a bid for higher office in 1962. Initially mulling over a potential race for the office of lieutenant governor which had a retiring incumbent, he had doubts when a similarly-named Atlanta attorney, Carl F. Sanders, declared his candidacy. Carl E. Sanders suspected that the other man had been planted to confuse voters and spoil his chances by another candidate, Peter Zack Geer. Geer denied the allegation. Carl E. Sanders then decided to run for governor. At the time he launched his candidacy in late April, Georgia used the county unit system in its primaries, whereby the candidate who won the majority in most counties secured the party nomination, instead of the candidate which earned the majority of all votes across the state. This system greatly limited the chances of urban candidates for decades. Several weeks into the primary, federal courts declared this method unconstitutional, and left the nomination to be decided by popular vote. Sanders campaigned on &quot;a platform of progress&quot;, pledging to improve education, reorganize the State Highway Department, revamp mental health and penal institutions, recruit industry, and reapportion the General Assembly.

Already seeking the nomination in the Democratic primary were former governor Marvin Griffin and incumbent Lieutenant Governor Garland T. Byrd. Byrd withdrew from the race after suffering a heart attack in May. Griffin was a staunch supporter of racial segregation. He attacked Sanders as too young for the governorship and not committed enough to defending segregation. Sanders supported segregation but felt it was useless to oppose federal integration orders. He promised to &quot;maintain Georgia&#x27;s traditional separation&quot; but said he opposed race-baiting politics and that &quot;I tip my hat to the past, but I take off my coat to the future.&quot; He also promised to keep public schools open, even if the federal government ordered them to integrate. Griffin held a rally with Alabama governor-elect George Wallace, another staunch segregationist, to demonstrate his support for racial separation. Sanders mocked this strategy at his own rally the same day, describing Griffin as &quot;so weak in his belief in Georgia and her people that he plans to import an outsider to meddle in our affairs. I don&#x27;t need an Alabama crutch to help me.&quot; Griffin pledged to oppose federal court orders to integrate and throughout the campaign vilified the &quot;Negro bloc vote&quot; in Georgia. Following a confrontation between the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan and the Georgia State Patrol at a Klan rally, Griffin offered that he was unsure of how to handle such a situation. Sanders accused the former governor of having prior knowledge of the rally and of bring Klansmen into Georgia. Sanders also accused Griffin of having run a corrupt administration in his previous term. In the primary, he defeated Griffin, receiving 494,978 votes (58.7 percent) to Griffin&#x27;s 332,746 (39 percent). Most of his support came from urban areas. He then won the general election. He took the oath of office on January 14 and was formally inaugurated as governor the following day. Aged 37 upon his assumption of the office, he was the youngest governor in the country at the time.

=== Executive actions ===
Sanders appointed a Governor&#x27;s Commission for Efficiency and Improvement in Government, which managed reforms in the penal system, mental healthcare, the civil service, the Highway Department, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Education. He worked with Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. to bring professional sports teams to the capital city, and in 1963 he recruited a friend, Rankin M. Smith Sr., to fund the creation of the Atlanta Falcons football team.

Sanders campaigned as a racial segregationist and did not actively support the civil rights movement for blacks when in office, but was forced to address racial issues on several occasions. He was regarded by observers as a racial moderate, and described his own position as &quot;a segregationist but not a damned fool.&quot; He regarded both white reactionaries and black civil rights activists as politically extreme. Concerned that racial violence would interfere with his plans to expand Georgia&#x27;s economy, he said, &quot;while I am governor we are going to obey the laws, we are not going to resist federal court orders with violence, and we are not going to close any schools.&quot; He appointed some blacks to state boards and the first blacks to the State Patrol and Georgia National Guard. Overall, his administration was staffed predominantly by whites and he appointed no black agency heads or judges. When confrontations between different groups over racial issues appeared, he tended to try and negotiate compromises, though he sent state police to Savannah in July 1963 to head off violence and placed police on standby in Atlanta in mid-1966 when Mayor Allen confronted angry black demonstrators. He criticized rioters and testified to Congress against the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, arguing it violated property rights.

=== Legislative affairs ===
By the time Sanders became governor, it was common for this official to wield wide influence over the General Assembly, including being able to essentially name the Speaker of the House and legislative committee chairmen. He was one of the last governors to be able to exercise this amount of authority over the legislature. In 1963 Leroy Johnson became the first black state senator in Georgia in decades. When guards at the State Capitol informed Sanders that Johnson and his black pages were ignoring signs designating &quot;white&quot; and &quot;colored&quot; restrooms and water fountains, the governor had the signage removed. Later, Johnson attempted to dine at the Commerce Club, an Atlanta venue frequented by legislators and other members of the state&#x27;s political and economic elite. The white maître d&#x27; refused Johnson service, so he contacted Sanders. Sanders called club founder Robert W. Woodruff, who subsequently instructed the maître d&#x27; to serve Johnson.
Sanders was a fiscal conservative. Most of his budgeting focus was directed at public education. His administration&#x27;s 1963 budget recommendation to the General Assembly devoted 56 percent of expenditures to education. At the governor&#x27;s request, the legislature created the Governor&#x27;s Commission to Improve Education, with 25 members appointed by the governor. The body included the first black people appointed to a state commission since the Reconstruction era. Equipped with the commission&#x27;s recommendations, the following year he stated that Georgia&#x27;s education system was a &quot;modern crisis&quot; and called for a $30 million increase in taxes to improve schools. This included a 50 cent increase on the tax per gallon on liquor, a 12 cent increase on the tax per case of beer, 1% increase in the corporate income tax, and the elimination of the vendors&#x27; commission on collection of the general sales tax. He further requested that the State Board of Education be empowered to establish minimum standards and that $100 million in bonds be issued to fund new educational institution construction. The General Assembly incorporated his suggestions with minimal alterations. Over the course of his tenure, schoolteacher and university faculty salaries were raised, 10,000 additional teachers were hired, a record number of new schools were built, new junior colleges and vocational schools were created, and a Governor&#x27;s Honors Program was established.

Sanders asked the legislature to appropriate funds for airport construction to attract industry to outlying communities. As a result, 33 new community airports were established in Georgia between 1965 and 1966. Georgia&#x27;s economy performed well during his tenure, and the state had a budget surplus when he left office.

While serving as governor, Sanders supported an attempt by the General Assembly to draft a new state constitution in 1963. The proposed document was prevented from being scheduled for a referendum necessary to ratify it by a United States district court, which ruled that since the legislators who had created the constitution were from malapportioned districts, their work was invalid. Sanders was deeply disappointed by the ruling. The decision was later reversed by the United States Supreme Court, but by then there was not sufficient political will to revamp the constitution. On February 17, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot; that Georgia had to redraw its congressional districts to comply with the principle of one man, one vote. The General Assembly had only four days to respond before its session was scheduled for adjournment, but Sanders urged it to redraw the districts. The legislators struggled with the process, and after his own floor leader had resigned the revisions to failure, Sanders visited the House floor on February 21 to encourage the body to keep working. Despite the vocal dissatisfaction of some legislators, a revised districting plan was ultimately passed.

=== Political affairs ===

Shortly after winning election, Sanders visited President of the United States John F. Kennedy. He was generally supportive of the president&#x27;s administration and used his New Frontier rhetoric.

In 1964 Sanders appointed a biracial delegation to represent Georgia at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, the first time that black people were represented on the delegation. Sanders explained, &quot;[T]his is not a social club. This is purely a political organization, based on the fact that every voter should be represented.&quot;

Under the term limit law then in effect, Sanders was ineligible to run for re-election in 1966. In the general election campaign that year, he endorsed Democratic nominee Lester Maddox, a segregationist, as his successor though the two had disagreed on many issues. At the Democratic State Convention in Macon on October 15, 1966, Sanders told the delegates: &quot;A man should be loyal to his country, his family, to his God and to his political party—and don&#x27;t you ever forget it.&quot; In his speech, Sanders likened Maddox&#x27;s Republican opponent, U.S. Representative Howard Callaway, to the &quot;arrogance of Richard Nixon, the chameleon ability of Ronald Reagan to switch rather than fight, and the callous concern for human needs that is a throwback to McKinley, Harding, and Coolidge.&quot; Callaway criticized Sanders for mishandling the state budget surplus, a position which weakened the Republican among anti-Maddox moderate voters. Callaway led Maddox in the popular vote but failed to win a majority, and the Democratic-controlled Georgia General Assembly chose Maddox as governor. Sanders was succeeded by Maddox on January 10, 1967.

== 1970 gubernatorial campaign ==

Sanders left office at the peak of his popularity and turned down several offers for federal government positions from President Johnson. Instead he returned to mount an unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1970. The other two candidates in the Democratic primary were former state senator Jimmy Carter and black attorney Chevene Bowers King. Sanders was initially favored by most political observers as the candidate most likely to win. Early polls conducted at the behest of Carter showed most Georgians held a favorable view of Sanders&#x27; previous gubernatorial term. Carter directed his campaign team to frame his opponent as anti-democratic, &quot;nouveau riche&quot;, &quot;Atlanta-oriented&quot;, overly liberal, and hostile to George Wallace.

Carter attempted to portray himself as friendly to the &quot;average man&quot; and working-class voters, while portraying Sanders as out-of-touch and regularly referring to him as &quot;Cuff Links Carl&quot;. He also regularly claimed without basis that Sanders had used his time in office to enrich himself. Sanders ran with the slogan &quot;Carl Sanders ought to be governor again,&quot; which appeared to some voters as arrogant. Furthermore, while his television advertisements showed him as a man of success while jogging, boating, and flying, Carter&#x27;s ads focused on his farming background and suggested that Sanders was the candidate of the &quot;big-money boys&quot;.

Carter&#x27;s campaign anonymously distributed a photo of Sanders getting doused with a bottle of champagne by a black Atlanta Hawks basketball player celebrating a victory at a game. The photo communicated several potentially damaging messages about Sanders, including his wealth, an association with alcohol (which was disliked in teetotalist rural communities) and a personal connection with a black person. The Carter campaign also published anonymous &quot;fact-sheets&quot; which described Sanders as a staunch ally of controversial black legislator Julian Bond (the two actually disliked one another), noted his attendance at the funeral of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., and attacked him for denying Wallace an official visit to the state. At the same time, the campaign set up a fictitious &quot;Black Concern Committee&quot; to draw black support away from Sanders by arguing that he had failed to honor promises to the black community during his gubernatorial tenure. Carter&#x27;s campaign press secretary later described their efforts as a &quot;nigger campaign&quot;.

In the September 9 Democratic primary, Carter led with 388,280 votes, while Sanders placed second with 301,179 votes, most of them from blacks or urbanites. With the contest moving to a runoff since no candidate had won an outright majority, Sanders began a series of attacks on Carter. At a press conference shortly after the first primary, he called Carter &quot;a smiling hypocrite&quot; and a staunch liberal. When Carter refused to debate him, Sanders hosted a televised debate with an empty chair, though the absent opponent brushed the event aside, quipping &quot;Some folks said the chair was ahead.&quot; After Carter secured the endorsement of segregationist publisher Roy V. Harris, Sanders&#x27; campaign crafted a pamphlet which depicted Carter climbing into a bed with Harris. Sanders&#x27; workers also created another pamphlet showing a picture of dilapidated tenant housing on Carter&#x27;s farm, captioned &quot;Isn&#x27;t it time someone spoke up for these people?&quot; Carter denounced the literature as smear sheets and warned his campaign workers about their distribution. During the last few days of the campaign, Sanders&#x27; organization launched an intense effort to fly the pamphlets into far-flung areas of the state. Many were intercepted by Carter supporters posing as Sanders campaigners and destroyed.

In the runoff primary Carter won with 60 percent of the vote. Sanders received 93 percent of the black vote and the support of his erstwhile backers, but Carter won overwhelmingly in rural areas. He felt guilty about the tactics he had employed, and after his win he called Sanders to apologize for attacking his character. Carter was victorious in the subsequent general election, and was later elected President of the United States in 1976. Sanders remained bitter about the 1970 campaign, and later said of Carter, &quot;He is not proud of that election, and he shouldn&#x27;t be proud of it,&quot; though he also thought Carter made &quot;more of a class distinction than a race distinction&quot; in the campaign. He never pursued public office after his loss but remained an active fundraiser for Democratic candidates. He served as the finance chairman of the Georgia Democratic Party during George Busbee&#x27;s gubernatorial tenure.

==Later life and death==

In 1967 Sanders joined with several other lawyers to create the firm Troutman, Sanders, Lockerman &amp; Ashmore in Atlanta. He renewed his focus on the firm—which was renamed Troutman Sanders in 1992—after his loss in the 1970 gubernatorial race and recruited Georgia Power and Southern Company as clients. He became chairman of First Georgia Bank in 1973. He served as chairman of the law firm for thirty years, and in 2006 became its chairman emeritus. At the time of his death, Troutman Sanders had grown to include 600 lawyers. Sanders died in Atlanta on November 16, 2014, at the age of 89, after a fall at his home.

In recognition of his role in encouraging the construction and expansion of airports in Georgia, he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame in 1997. The Carl E. Sanders Family YMCA opened in Buckhead, Atlanta, in 2000, after a gift to construct it was made in Sanders’ honor by Guy Millner.

<text>Kevin Conroy (November 30, 1955 – November 10, 2022) was an American actor. He appeared in a variety of stage performances, television series, and television films. Conroy earned fame for voicing the DC Comics superhero Batman in various animated media, beginning with &quot;&quot; in 1992. Conroy went on to voice the character for dozens of animated television series, feature films, and video games over the next three decades.

==Early life==
Kevin Conroy was born on November 30, 1955, in Westbury, New York, into an Irish Catholic family. He moved to Westport, Connecticut, when he was about 11 years old. He had three older siblings. Conroy held dual American and Irish citizenship.

Due to the tumultuous environment in his home, Conroy lived with a family friend during his last year of high school. Conroy&#x27;s father was an alcoholic and once attempted suicide while Conroy was in high school. In adulthood, Conroy was estranged from his father for many years but they reconciled shortly before his death. He was at both his mother&#x27;s side and his father&#x27;s side when they died.

Conroy moved to New York City in 1973 when he earned a full scholarship to attend the Juilliard School&#x27;s drama division, studying under actor/director John Houseman. While there, he roomed with Robin Williams, who was in the same group as both Conroy and Kelsey Grammer. After graduating from Juilliard in 1978, he toured with Houseman&#x27;s performing group The Acting Company, and the following year he went on the national tour of Ira Levin&#x27;s &quot;Deathtrap&quot;. Conroy and his co-star Brian Bedford did not get along, and got into an on-stage brawl during the opening night performance of &quot;Deathtrap&quot; at the Kennedy Center.

==Career==
===Theatre===
In 1980, after playing the role of Jerry Grove in the New York City-based daytime soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, Conroy moved out to California to pursue further work in television. Conroy became associated with the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, where he performed in productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. From 1980 to 1985, he acted in a variety of contemporary and classic theatre pieces, including the Broadway productions of Edward Albee&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Lolita and Eastern Standard&quot;. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that, as a gay man living in New York City in the time of the AIDS epidemic, he &quot;went to so many funerals that [he] felt such a sense of obligation&quot; to portray the character of a TV producer secretly living with AIDS in &quot;Eastern Standard.&quot;

===Film and television===
Conroy returned to television in the 1985 TV film &quot;Covenant&quot; and had a role on another daytime soap drama, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;. Conroy played gay lawyer Bart Fallmont on &quot;Dynasty&quot; from 1985 to 1986. He was a series regular on &quot;Ohara&quot; in 1987, and as the company commander on &quot;Tour of Duty&quot; from 1987 to 1988, before starring in a series of television films. Though initially cast as one of the show&#x27;s main characters, his role on the show was reduced while it filmed in Hawaii and he ended up spending much of his time making portraits of tourists on the Honolulu boardwalk. Conroy also guest starred on shows such as &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot; and &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.

===Voice acting===

As a voice actor, Conroy is known for his starring role in &quot;&quot; (1992–1995). He was notably the first voice actor to alter his voice tone between portraying Batman and Bruce Wayne, which Michael Keaton had previously done in Tim Burton&#x27;s live-action &quot;Batman&quot; films. However, Conroy based his dual-voice performance on Leslie Howard in the 1934 film &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;. He continued to voice Batman in various animated spin-off productions, which collectively took place in what is known as the DC Animated Universe (DCAU). These spin-offs include the TV shows &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997–1999), &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001, in which he portrays an elderly Bruce Wayne retired from crimefighting), &quot;Justice League&quot; (2001–2004), and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004–2006), as well as the theatrical film &quot;&quot; (1993), and the direct-to-video films &quot;Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero&quot; (1998), &quot;Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker&quot; (2000), and &quot;&quot; (2003). He also voiced the DCAU Batman for guest appearances in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot; and &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;.

Conroy went on to voice Batman in the direct-to-video DC Universe Animated Original Movies: &quot;&quot; (2008), &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot; (2009), &quot;Superman/Batman: Apocalypse&quot; (2010), &quot;Justice League: Doom&quot; (2012), &quot;Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox&quot; (2013), &quot;&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2016), &quot;Batman and Harley Quinn&quot; (2017), and &quot;Justice League vs. the Fatal Five&quot; (2019). He later returned to voicing Batman on TV for the animated series &quot;Justice League Action&quot; (2016-2018), along with guest appearances on &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot;. In a tally of the actor&#x27;s performances that include his every episode and film portrayal of Batman, Conroy portrayed the character longer than any other actor in live-action and animation. The previous record-holder was Olan Soule, who voiced Batman in various animated works between the late 1960s and early 1980s (including &quot;Super Friends&quot;).

After the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City, Conroy participated in relief efforts by volunteering to cook for people. During an audio commentary on &quot;&quot;, Conroy expressed his surprise at the reaction of the emergency service workers to his presence. At the behest of another cook, Conroy called out from the kitchen to the dining area in his &quot;Batman voice&quot;, reciting the iconic line, &quot;I am vengeance! I am the night! I am Batman!&quot; (from the &quot;BTAS&quot; episode &quot;Nothing to Fear&quot;). This was greeted by cheers and applause from emergency service personnel, many of whom had been fans of &quot;Batman: The Animated Series&quot; during its airing in the 1990s. Conroy confessed to being humbled and deeply flattered by the reaction.
Conroy also voiced Batman for multiple video games, including the &quot;&quot; series. Following the release of &quot;&quot; (2009) and &quot;&quot; (2011), he stated at the 2013 Dallas Comic Con that he had been working on &quot;the next Arkham&quot;, leading to rampant speculation that he would reprise his role in &quot;&quot;. In June 2013, however, it was confirmed that Conroy would not be involved in &quot;Arkham Origins&quot; (Batman was instead voiced by Roger Craig Smith in that game), meaning Conroy may had been referring to a yet-unannounced game from the &quot;Arkham&quot; series. He would ultimately reprise the role for the fourth game in the series, titled &quot;&quot; (2015). The 2024 sequel to &quot;Arkham Knight&quot;, &quot;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&quot;, marked his final video game performance as Batman. However, in early 2024, it was revealed that Conroy had recorded a role for &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths – Part Three&quot;.

In October 2013, Conroy appeared on Tim Daly&#x27;s web series &quot;The Daly Show&quot;, parodying his role as Batman, with Daly reprising the role of Superman from &quot;Superman: The Animated Series&quot;.

Conroy portrayed Bruce Wayne of Earth-99 in live-action in the Arrowverse crossover &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. This was his only live-action portrayal of the character.

Mark Hamill, Conroy&#x27;s frequent voice actor co-star as the Joker, spoke highly of working with him. Regarding his willingness to be involved in a Batman-related project, Hamill said, &quot;When they offer me roles now, I say, &#x27;Is Kevin doing it?&#x27; ... I don&#x27;t even have to read the script, if Kevin&#x27;s doing it, I&#x27;ll do it.&quot; In 2023, following Conroy&#x27;s death, Hamill stated he was done voicing the Joker, citing his Joker quote &quot;Without Batman, crime has no punchline&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In a 2016 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; promoting the of &quot;&quot;, Kevin Conroy revealed that he was gay. As part of DC Comics&#x27; 2022 Pride anthology, Conroy wrote &quot;Finding Batman&quot;, a story that recounted his life and experiences as a gay man. It received critical acclaim upon release. He was married to Vaughn C. Williams at the time of his death.

Conroy made an effort to conceal his homosexuality throughout most of his career. He spoke in &quot;Finding Batman&quot; about the discrimination he faced once potential collaborators and employers discovered his homosexuality. Conroy said that on multiple occasions he had been removed from consideration for acting jobs due to his sexual orientation.

In the 2016 United States Presidential Election, Conroy supported Hillary Clinton and described Donald Trump as &quot;a xenophobic, narcissistic clown, who&#x27;s only interested in himself&quot;.

Conroy made frequent appearances at comic book conventions; his last convention was in Connecticut in July 2022.

== Death ==
Conroy died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City on November 10, 2022, at age 66, of intestinal cancer. Upon news of his death, DC Comics gave free online access to &quot;Finding Batman&quot; as a way to honor Conroy. &quot;Finding Batman&quot; went on to win the 2023 Eisner Award for Best Short Story. His co-stars, including Mark Hamill and Tim Daly, and numerous other figures paid tribute to Conroy on social media.

<text>Bobbie Diane Eakes is an American actress and singer. She is known for her role as Macy Alexander on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (1989–2000, 2001, 2002–2003) and for her role as Krystal Carey on &quot;All My Children&quot; (2003–2011).

==Biography==
===Personal life===
She is the youngest of five daughters in an Air Force family.

Eakes was Miss Georgia 1982, placing among the top 10 at Miss America 1983. She studied at the University of Georgia. In 1992 she married novelist and actor David Steen on July 4.

===Career===
Eakes received bit roles on nighttime television series, such as &quot;Cheers&quot;, before becoming successful in the soap opera genre. In the mid-1980s, she was the lead singer of the dance-pop rock group Big Trouble. The group released one self-titled CD in 1987, which was produced by Giorgio Moroder. Their single &quot;Crazy World&quot; charted on the U.S. singles chart, reaching No. 71. As a result, Big Trouble became short-lived one-hit wonders. 

She first achieved fame in the role of Macy Alexander on the soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, which she played from 1989 to 2000 (on contract), 2001 (guest appearance) and 2002 to 2003 (on contract). A very popular &quot;good girl&quot; kind of character, Macy battled with her inner demons (including an addiction to alcohol) before finally finding happiness with Deacon Sharpe (played by Sean Kanan). On the show, Macy was an accomplished singer in her own right (in tune with Eakes&#x27; hobby).

Between stints as Macy, Eakes hosted shows on the country music television channel Great American Country. She was also featured on country music singer Collin Raye&#x27;s 2000 single &quot;Tired of Loving This Way&quot;, which peaked at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. 

On July 7, 2000, her character &quot;died&quot; in a fiery explosion when her car crashed into a gasoline truck when the writers of the show felt the character of Macy no longer contributed to the show&#x27;s storyline. She was brought back to the show during the &quot;B&amp;B&quot; location shoot at Portofino, Italy in December 2002, and was then killed off after a chandelier fell on her during a concert in 2003. The decision was made to kill Macy off a second time after Eakes had decided to take the role of Krystal Carey on &quot;All My Children&quot;, as the complete opposite of Macy, playing the sexy and sassy character. The role of Krystal is loosely based on Eakes&#x27; Southern upbringing.

Eakes also starred in productions of &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Love Letters&quot; opposite her former costar Jeff Trachta in Los Angeles. The two have still been friends offscreen. The CD they recorded together, &quot;Bold and Beautiful Duets&quot;, went double-platinum in Europe. 

With &quot;All My Children&quot; airing its final episode on ABC in September 2011, earlier in June it was highly rumored that Eakes would be returning to &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. She also starred as Katherine &quot;Kitty&quot; on &quot;The Grove: The Series&quot; created by Crystal Chappell and in 12 episodes of &quot;Tainted Dreams&quot;. Both were released exclusively online.

<text>A kettle, sometimes called a tea kettle or teakettle, is a device specialized for boiling water, commonly with a &quot;lid&quot;, &quot;spout&quot;, and &quot;handle&quot;. There are two main types: the &quot;stovetop kettle&quot;, which uses heat from a hob, and the &quot;electric kettle&quot;, which is a small kitchen appliance with an internal heating element.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;kettle&quot; originates from Old Norse &quot;ketill&quot;, &quot;cauldron&quot;. The Old English spelling was &quot;cetel&quot; with initial &quot;che-&quot; [tʃ] like &#x27;cherry&#x27;, Middle English (and dialectal) was &quot;chetel&quot;, both come (together with German &quot;Kessel&quot; &quot;cauldron&quot;) ultimately from Germanic &quot;*katilaz&quot;, that was borrowed from Latin &quot;catillus&quot;, diminutive form of &quot;catinus&quot; &quot;deep vessel for serving or cooking food&quot;, which in various contexts is translated as &quot;bowl&quot;, &quot;deep dish&quot;, or &quot;funnel&quot;.
== Stovetop kettles ==

A modern stovetop kettle is a metal vessel with a flat bottom used to heat water on a stovetop or hob. They usually have a handle on top, a spout, and a lid. Some also have a steam whistle that indicates when the water has reached its boiling point.

Kettles are typically made with stainless steel but can also be made from copper or other metals.

== Electric kettles ==
In countries with 200240V mains electricity, electric kettles are commonly used to boil water without the necessity of a stove top. The heating element is typically fully enclosed, with a power rating of 2–3 kW. This means that the current draw for an electric kettle is up to 13A, which is a sizeable proportion of the current available for many homes: the main fuse of most homes varies between 20 and 100 amps. In countries with 120 V mains electricity, twice as much current is drawn for the same power.
In modern designs, once the water has reached its boiling point, the kettle automatically deactivates, preventing the water from boiling away and damaging the heating element.

=== Development ===
Electric kettles were introduced as an alternative to stovetop kettles in the latter part of the 19th century. In 1893 the Crompton and Co. firm in the United Kingdom started featuring electric kettles in their catalogue. Although these kettles were quite primitive as the heating element couldn&#x27;t be immersed in the water. Instead, a separate compartment underneath the water storage area in the kettle was used to house the electric heating element. The design was inefficient even relative to the conventional stove-top kettles of the time.

In 1902, the &#x27;Archer&#x27; electric kettle made by Premier Electric Heaters in Birmingham, England, was marketed as a luxury item. It had an element sealed in the base of the kettle (not exposed to water), and was one of the first kettles with a boil-safe device.

In 1922, Leslie Large, an engineer working at Bulpitt &amp; Sons of Birmingham, designed an element of wire wound around a core and sheathed in a metal tube. The element could be immersed directly into water which made the kettle much more efficient than stovetop kettles.

In 1955, the newly founded British company Russell Hobbs brought out its stainless steel K1 model as the first fully automatic kettle. A bimetallic strip, heated through a pipe by the steam produced as the water comes to the boil, flexes, and cuts off the current. As little steam is produced before boiling occurs, the bimetallic thermostat is set to activate well below , thus this design works even at higher altitudes where the boiling point is significantly lower. The design has since been widely adopted by other manufacturers.

== Whistling kettles ==

A whistling kettle is a kettle fitted with a device that emits an audible whistle when the water in the kettle starts to boil. The action of steam passing through the device causes vibration, in turn creating the sound, known in physics as a tone hole.

The exact mechanism by which this occurs was not fully understood until a paper, &quot;The Aeroacoustics of a Steam Kettle&quot;, was published by R. H. Henrywood, a fourth-year engineering undergraduate at the University of Cambridge, and A. Agarwal, his supervisor, in the journal &quot;Physics of Fluids&quot; in 2013.

Harry Bramson is the inventor of the whistling tea kettle.

== Automatic tea kettles ==
Automatic tea kettles are meant to make tea brewing easier, built with the capability to make different kinds of tea without much input from the user. Once set, the automatic tea kettle brings the water to the specific temperature for preparing a given kind of tea, adds the tea to the water, and steeps the tea for the appropriate amount of time. This is because different types of teas must be brewed at different temperatures in order to create a full, balanced flavor. Often they will make a beeping sound to alert the user when the tea is ready, and maintain the temperature of the beverage after preparation.

<text>Roleystoneis a suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the south eastern corridor.
==History==
In 1830, several grants of land were given to British colonists along the upper Canning River, with Stephen Henty acquiring 5,000 acres and Captain Charles Blisset Churchman obtaining 107 acres. These land grants encompassed what is now Araluen and Roleystone, the name of the latter being derived from &quot;Rolleston&quot;, the title Churchman gave his property. The land remained untended with Churchman dying in 1833 and Henty surrendering his land grant in 1841. It was purchased by Thomas Buckingham in 1858, who referred to it as &quot;Rollingstone&quot;. The area was also referred to as &quot;The Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Rowley Stone&quot; in early police reports.

In 1865, Buckingham built a sawmill, which was located at Sparrow&#x27;s Place, later known as Butcher&#x27;s, on the Roleystone Road, about 6.5 kilometres from Kelmscott. The area was subdivided into farmlets in 1902, and was subsequently developed as orchards and market gardens. Buckingham&#x27;s homestead still stands along with a brick and mortar sheep plunge dip on the property of Araluen Golf Resort. In 1905, Roleystone was opened up for closer settlement, with property brochures extolling the virtues of the scenery and fertile valley soils.

Roleystone is now an area of large residential &quot;R5&quot; zoned properties—with 2000 m2 minimum block sizes—surrounded by larger rural properties of native bushland and fruit orchards. The residential gardens, and surrounding council and regional reserves are home to a variety of native wildlife with bandicoots, brushtail possums, shingleback lizards and Children&#x27;s pythons in relative abundance. Large numbers of western grey kangaroos are found in bush surrounding the suburb.

On 6 February 2011, a declared total fire ban day, a bushfire occurred on private property adjacent to the Brookton Highway in the Roleystone/Kelmscott area. There were a total of 72 homes destroyed and 37 homes damaged. This is the second biggest house loss in Western Australia to a single bushfire event behind the 2016 Waroona-Yarloop bushfire.

==Facilities==
The main suburban residential area to the west of Roleystone is served by a neighbourhood shopping centre, with Stargate Kelmscott and Armadale Shopping City providing other commercial services. The suburb originally contained a primary school (K-5; 1905) and Roleystone District High School (6–10; 1983). The two schools were amalgamated into Roleystone Community College (K-10) after a community consultation process held in 2009, using new and existing buildings on the site of the existing Roleystone District High School, with state government and federal (Building the Education Revolution) funding. The majority of Year 11 and 12 students travel to schools in nearby suburbs, including Kelmscott Senior High School, Lesmurdie Senior High School, Mazenod College and St Brigid&#x27;s College.

The Araluen Botanic Park and the Araluen Golf Resort are located in the south of the suburb off Croyden Road and are popular picnic and wedding locations, especially during &quot;Springtime at Araluen&quot; when all the flowers are in bloom. Araluen is also known for the Araluen Chilli Festival, which was held in the park each year until 2009. In 2010, the festival was relocated to the Fremantle Esplanade and renamed &quot;Araluen&#x27;s Fremantle Chilli Festival&quot;, and since then has continued to be operated by—and to provide funding for—the Araluen Park.

Brookton Highway (State Route 40) runs through Roleystone.

The suburb is served by a number of school bus services and by Transperth bus route 241, which runs every hour during the day, connecting the suburb to Kelmscott railway station and Stargate Kelmscott shopping centre. All services are provided by the Public Transport Authority.

== Transport ==

=== Bus ===
* 241 Kelmscott Station to Kelmscott Station – serves Brookton Highway, Peet Road, Urch Road, Raeburn Road, Holden Road, Northward Road and Westborne Road

==Local sporting clubs==
Roleystone is home to an Australian rules football club, The Roleystone Tigers. There is both a junior football club (established in 1973) and a senior football club, with the latter having amateur league team.
The Roleystone-Karragullen Cricket Club was established in 1950 and currently fields five senior men&#x27;s and two senior women&#x27;s teams along with nine junior sides.
The Roleystone Country Club is located on Wygonda Road and has views down the Brookton valley.

==Local music and arts==
Roleystone is home to the Roleystone Musicians Club. The club was established in March 2007.

Kevin Peek, a guitarist and member of the band Sky, named a Sky song after Roleystone, his home town.

Roleystone is also the home of the Roleystone Theatre – both the venue and the group. The group was formed in 1933 as the Roleystone Choral and Dramatic society, with a name change in the 1970s to the Roleystone Theatre Group. The Group is a community theatre presenting plays and musicals throughout each year.

The Roleystone Theatre (venue), first built by Roleystone and Karragullen residents in 1922 and now owned by the City of Armadale, is currently closed for remedial building works (2018 to 2022). The Roleystone Theatre Group was utilising the Roleystone Hall as their temporary home until early 2022, however until the theatre is re-built and re-opened they do not have a performance venue. It is hoped the revitalised theatre building will open in 2023.

Another notable cultural group in Roleystone is the &quot;Bohemian Club of Roleystone&quot;, an exclusive collective dedicated to celebrating 1960s and 1970s counterculture. Founded in Roleystone, the club blends bohemian lifestyle with a passion for psychedelic arts, music, and free-spirited expression.

Members engage in psychedelic exploration, drawing inspiration from Aleister Crowley and Thelema, and regularly host gatherings that incorporate esoteric practices and artistic expression.

==Local news media==
There is one local newspapers/magazine: the &quot;Roleystone Courier&quot;. This monthly magazine is owned and created by a local resident.

Additionally, The Roleystone Times, an independent local online news website founded by Roleystone Media Group, offers up-to-date coverage of local events, news, and community stories. It is affiliated with the Bohemian Club of Roleystone.

Mees began his career as a student at the University of Delaware in Newark. After graduation in 1972, he became the sports director at WILM-AM radio in Wilmington. Mees returned to Delaware in 1992 when he announced the Blue Hens&#x27; America East Championship for ESPN from the field house.

After six years in Wilmington and one year at WECA-TV in Tallahassee, Florida, Mees was hired by ESPN as one of their first on-air personalities for the network&#x27;s launch in 1979 on September 7. In 2005, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame.

==ESPN==
Mees was a lead anchor on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from 1979 to 1985 when he took on hosting and occasional play-by-play duties for NHL on ESPN. ESPN later lost the NHL contract to SportsChannel America, and he returned full-time to &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. When the NHL returned to ESPN in 1992–93, he worked NHL games as a play-by-play man during the season with Darren Pang, Brian Engblom, and John Davidson as his analysts, and he hosted &quot;SportsCenter&quot; in the off-season. Mees was an early advocate of NCAA Ice Hockey on ESPN, worked play-by-play for the Frozen Four (NCAA Hockey&#x27;s championship tournament), and contributed to the increased visibility of that tournament.

Other sports Mees called for ESPN included college basketball, college football, and Major League Baseball. He also anchored the network&#x27;s coverage of the United States Football League in the 1980s.

By the 15th anniversary of ESPN, Mees (along with Chris Berman and Bob Ley) was one of three original &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors still with the network.

==Death==
On August 14, 1996, Mees, who did not know how to swim, drowned in a neighbor&#x27;s swimming pool in Southington, Connecticut. Police initially said that Mees had jumped into the pool to save his younger daughter but later said they did not know how he ended up in the water and classified his death as an accident.

He and Michelle, his wife of almost 10 years, had two daughters: Lauren who was 8 years old and Gabrielle who was 4 at the time of his death.

<text>12 Memories is the fourth studio album from Scottish alternative rock band Travis. The album was released on 11 October 2003 on Epic Records. In comparison, the album is a much more mature and lyrically darker album, focusing on issues such as the 2003 Iraq invasion, politicians, psychological crisis and domestic abuse.

==Background and recording==
Travis drummer Neil Primrose suffered a severe spinal injury in a swimming pool accident in July 2002. The band were forced to take six months off during his recuperation before regrouping. Moving into a cottage on the island of Mull they set up a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of &quot;12 Memories&quot;.

Musically, &quot;12 Memories&quot; has embraced use of distorted guitars and a more electronic, rockier and even trip hop style. Three singles were released from the album - &quot;Re-Offender&quot;, a track that deals with domestic abuse, &quot;The Beautiful Occupation&quot;, a song which was inspired by the invasion of Iraq by US and coalition forces in 2003, and &quot;Love Will Come Through&quot;, a more traditional Travis song, which was later featured in a marketing campaign by the Post Office. Whilst being titled &quot;12 Memories&quot;, there are only eleven tracks on the album, each one of these a &quot;memory&quot;. The &quot;12th memory&quot; is actually &quot;Some Sad Song&quot;, a hidden track following the last track that criticises the Catholic school system, in which vocalist and songwriter Fran Healy was educated. The album cover is somewhat similar to those of The Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970) and U2&#x27;s &quot;Pop&quot; (1997).

This is the only Travis album without their logo on the album cover. However, their logo can be seen from the album cover, as the visible part of the rear back cover, the Travis logo can be found. The rear back cover is also similar to the cover of &quot;Re-Offender&quot;, the lead single. As the album does not display the title on the cover either, a sticker is featured on the case which says the title of the album. Also, a Parental Guidance logo is featured as a sticker on the case.

==Release and reception==
&quot;12 Memories&quot; entered the UK charts at #3, with lead single &quot;Re-Offender&quot; scoring the band their fifth Top Ten UK hit at #7. Charting at #48, &quot;The Beautiful Occupation&quot; was their first single to miss the Top 40, although the following single, fan favourite &quot;Love Will Come Through&quot;, fared slightly better, charting at #28. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and political territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, &quot;Then, of course, there&#x27;s Travis and their album &quot;12 Memories&quot; [Epic]. You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It&#x27;s like an old album. It&#x27;s like the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Revolver&quot; [1966]. Fran Healy&#x27;s voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful&quot; — Elton John). The album received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64 based on 22 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Yet &quot;12 Memories&quot; also saw the band lose ground in the US, where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the twelve memories being twelve reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn&#x27;t mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band&#x27;s decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.

<text>Saint Paul University () is a bilingual Catholic university federated with the University of Ottawa since 1965. It is located on Main Street in Canada&#x27;s capital city, Ottawa, Ontario. Fully bilingual, it offers instruction in both of the country&#x27;s official languages: French and English. The university has been entrusted for over a century and a half to the Congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. In August 1866, the university was endowed a civil charter that was passed by the government of the Province of Canada. It later received a pontifical declaration promulgated by Pope Leo XIII on 5 February 1889.

==History==
In 1848, Joseph-Bruno Guigues, the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa, established the &quot;College of Bytown&quot;. In 1856, the college was officially entrusted to the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, and, in 1866, it was renamed the &quot;College of Ottawa&quot;. The institution would later rewrite its pontifical charter in keeping with the Apostolic Constitution of Pope Pius XI, and also rewrote its civil charter around the same time. Its rewritten civil charter was approved by the Government of Ontario in 1933, when it was officially renamed the &quot;University of Ottawa&quot;, and its revised pontifical charter was approved by the Holy See in 1934. On July 1, 1965, by an act of the Ontario Legislature, the institution previously known as the University of Ottawa was renamed &quot;Saint Paul University&quot;, which retained its civil and pontifical charters, while a new corporate body, to be known as the University of Ottawa, was created to inherit the majority of the university&#x27;s holdings.

== Jean-Léon Allie Library and Archives ==
The collection contains over 500,000 volumes, 1,000 current periodicals and some 100,000 microforms.

History

The library began on April 27, 1937, as the library of the University of Ottawa&#x27;s seminary. The late Father Jean-Léon Allie, O.M.I., was its founder and first Chief Librarian. After occupying that post for more than 40 years, Father Allie continued to devote all his energies to the Library, as Acquisitions Librarian, then as University Librarian Emeritus, until his death on November 26, 1996.

Starting with only four books, the library began immediately to grow through generous donations from other religious institutions, as well as through the founder&#x27;s judicious purchases, to become the largest of its kind in Canada. The excellent quality of the library has long been recognized by scholars in philosophy, medieval studies and theology. As early as 1963, in a survey conducted for the National Conference of Canadian Universities and Colleges, Edwin E. Williams of Harvard University stated: &quot;Ottawa (i.e. Saint Paul University) has nationally outstanding collections for philosophy and religious history, with advanced research holdings for work in ... medieval studies.&quot;

The organization of the collection follows that of the Library of Congress mixed the Lynn-Peterson Classification System.

==Partnership==
The university is a member of the Association of Colleges and Universities of the Canadian Francophonie, a network of academic institutions of the Canadian Francophonie.

It was announced from autumn 2017, that St. Paul&#x27;s, will begin offering, a joint distance learning, Licentiate in Canon Law (JCL) and joint civil masters in canon law with St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, Ireland.

<doc id="953896" wikidata="Q813036" url="?curid=953896" title="Bearskin Airlines">
<text>Bearskin Lake Air Service LP, operating as Bearskin Airlines, is a regional airline based in Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. It is a division of Perimeter Aviation and operates services in northern Ontario and Manitoba. Its main base is at Thunder Bay International Airport (YQT), with a hub at Greater Sudbury Airport (YSB).

== History ==

The airline was established in 1963 by bush pilot Otto John Hegland and began operations in July 1963 from its base at Big Trout Lake, home of the Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation. However, the airline was named after Bearskin Lake, home of the Bearskin Lake First Nation (where Hegland had a general store). It started by providing only charter services to the remote First Nations reserves in northern Ontario, using bush planes equipped with floats in the summer and skis in the winter. In 1977, it began its first regular scheduled flights between Big Trout Lake and Sioux Lookout.

From then on, other scheduled flights were progressively added, first to Thunder Bay, followed by Kenora and Winnipeg. This was also the period when the Government of Ontario began constructing new airfields that would make the northern communities accessible year-round. Therefore, in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Bearskin made the transition of bush planes to wheeled commuter planes. It entered into a commercial agreement with Air Ontario and joined Aeroplan in fall 1988.

In the 1990s, Bearskin operated between Thunder Bay and Minneapolis–Saint Paul for almost three years. Following the collapse of NorOntair in 1996, Bearskin picked up over two-thirds of that carrier&#x27;s routes, thereby adding scheduled service to all the major northern Ontario cities including Marathon, Timmins and Wawa. Three years later, it expanded operations to destinations in northern Manitoba.

In September 2001, Bearskin launched its route between Toronto-Buttonville and Ottawa with seven daily roundtrips on weekdays and three daily roundtrips on weekends. This was followed by Toronto-Buttonville and Sudbury route with three daily roundtrips in April 2003. In July 2003, it sold its routes and assets servicing northern First Nations communities to Wasaya Airways for $18 million. This marked a break from its bush flying background to focus on becoming a regional carrier. It withdrew its service between Toronto-Buttonville and Ottawa in August 2004 due to competition from major carriers. Sudbury received major connectivity improvement in April 2006. Bearskin launched a new route between Ottawa and Waterloo in October 2007.

It was owned by Harvey Friesen (president), Cliff Friesen (executive vice-president), Karl Friesen (vice president of operations), Rick Baratta (vice president of finance) and Brad Martin (director of operations). In 2010 it was sold to Exchange Income Corporation (EIC) for $32 million. EIC also owns Calm Air, Perimeter Aviation, PAL Airlines, Keewatin Air, and several other non-airline companies. Bearskin had 240 employees in 2007.

As of April 1, 2014, all service at Region of Waterloo Airport (YKF) and Ottawa Airport (YOW) was cancelled, affecting seven routes and significantly decreased the flight operations. The company indicated that a softening mining sector and high tech sectors (such as BlackBerry) were to blame for cutting the routes. Additional factors included the introduction of new competitors (such as Porter Airlines). The company indicated that it is refocusing on northwestern and northeastern routes in Northern Ontario.

Bearskin is a major provider of flights for Hope Air, a charity that organizes free non-emergency medical flights for people in financial need, particularly from remote communities.

== Destinations ==

Bearskin Airlines operates services to the following Canadian domestic scheduled destinations:

==Affinity programs==
Bearskin Airlines joined the Aeroplan when it entered into a commercial agreement with Air Ontario in fall 1988. It participated in the Aeroplan rewards program until June 30, 2018 (the airline merged with Perimeter Aviation on December 31, 2017). Since then, Bearskin Airlines is part of Perimeter Aviation&#x27;s frequent flyer program, Connecting Rewards.

==Accidents and incidents==
*May 1, 1995: Flight 362, a Swearingen Metroliner, collided with an Air Sandy Piper Navajo Chieftain while on approach to Sioux Lookout Airport, destroying both aircraft and killing all persons on both aircraft, a total of eight dead.
*December 4, 1997: Flight 310, a Beechcraft 99 hit the runway at Webequie Airport when it descended too quickly. No injuries were reported but the aircraft was written off.
*November 10, 2013: Bearskin Airlines Flight 311, a Swearingen Metroliner, crashed on approach into Red Lake Airport in Ontario after a flight from Sioux Lookout Airport, killing five of seven people aboard. The crash occurred south of the airfield where the aircraft struck trees and a power line before being destroyed by impact and fire. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada concluded that there was a total failure of the left engine about above ground due to an internal component. This slowed the aircraft and caused it to stall. This led Honeywell, the engine manufacturer, to issue a change to inspection procedures for fuel nozzles.
*On February 24, 2020 a Fairchild SA227-DC Metro 23 aircraft, operated by Perimeter Aviation as Bearskin Airlines Flight 344, crashed about 4:10 p.m. CT at Dryden airport in Ontario. Transportation Safety Board of Canada investigations found pilot error was the result due to an incomplete pre-taxi checklist. The aircraft left the runway while taxiing and crashed into a snowbank at speed with left propeller fragments penetrating the aircraft interior and injuring passengers. Multiple passengers were injured but there were no fatalities.

<text>Chainik (East Slavic: &quot;чайник&quot;, &quot;teakettle&quot;, &quot;teapot&quot;) is a term that implies both ignorance and a certain amount of willingness to learn (as well as a propensity to cause disaster), but does not necessarily imply as little experience or short exposure time as newbie and is not as derogatory as luser. Both a novice user and someone using a computer system for a long time without any understanding of the internals can be referred to as chainiks. 

It is a widespread term in Russian hackish, often used in an English context by Russian-speaking hackers especially in Israel (e.g. &quot;Our new colleague is a complete chainik&quot;). FidoNet discussion groups often had a &quot;chainik&quot; subsection for newbies and old chainiks (e.g. SU.CHAINIK, RU.LINUX.CHAINIK). Public projects often have a chainik mailing list to keep the chainiks out the developers&#x27; and experienced users&#x27; discussions. Today, the word is slowly slipping into mainstream Russian due to the Russian translation of the popular &quot;For Dummies&quot; series which uses &quot;chainik&quot; for &quot;dummy&quot;.

Term can also apply to novice mountaineers, backpackers, drivers, etc., with such usage predating the usage in computing context. 

Some suggest the term is derived from a Russian folk custom to make a gift of a hollow thing – e.g., a pitted pumpkin, a kettle, or a teapot – to unsuccessful matchmakers of an aspiring groom rejected by a bride. The unlucky groom was mockingly called &quot;chainik&quot;. Over time the term entered other usages for unlucky, inept, or newbie people.

<doc id="953910" wikidata="Q232757" url="?curid=953910" title="Gabrielle Anwar">
<text>Gabrielle Anwar (born 4 February 1970) is a British-American actress. She is known for her television roles as Sam Black in the second series of &quot;Press Gang&quot;, as Margaret Tudor in the first season of &quot;The Tudors&quot;, as Lady Tremaine in the seventh season of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, and for her starring role as Fiona Glenanne on the USA network television series &quot;Burn Notice&quot; (2007–2013). Anwar is also known for the 1991 film &quot;Wild Hearts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot;, for dancing the tango with Al Pacino in the 1992 film &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, and for the 1993 films &quot;Body Snatchers&quot; and &quot;For Love or Money&quot;.

== Early life ==
Anwar was born in Laleham, Surrey, west of central London, England. Her mother, Shirley Hills, is an actress, and her father, Tariq Anwar, is a film producer and editor. Her paternal grandmother, Edith Reich, was an Austrian Jew, while her paternal grandfather was an Indian Muslim. Anwar attended Laleham C of E Primary and Middle School from 1975 to 1982; an end-of-term St Trinian&#x27;s sketch in the school concert of 1982 gave an early indication of her theatrical leanings. She studied drama and dance at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London.

== Career ==
Anwar&#x27;s acting debut was in the 1986 British miniseries &quot;Hideaway&quot;. She also starred in the music video to Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Little Head&quot;. Her film début was &quot;Manifesto&quot; (1988), which was followed by more British television productions including &quot;First Born&quot;, &quot;Summer&#x27;s Lease&quot;, &quot;Press Gang&quot;, and &quot;The Mysteries of the Dark Jungle&quot;. While working on films and television in London, she met American actor Craig Sheffer, and moved with him to Hollywood. Anwar and Sheffer have co-starred in a number of American films together, such as &quot;In Pursuit of Honor&quot;, &quot;The Grave&quot;, &quot;Turbulence 3: Heavy Metal&quot;, &quot;Flying Virus&quot;, &quot;Save It for Later&quot;, &quot;Water Under the Bridge&quot;, and &quot;Long Lost Son&quot;.

Her first American film was &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, in which she played the daughter of a murdered British agent (played by Roger Daltrey). She also appeared in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27; music video for Into the Great Wide Open. In 1992, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as competitive ice skater Tricia Kinney, who has a brief romance with Brandon Walsh. She starred in &quot;Wild Hearts Can&#x27;t Be Broken&quot; (inspired by &quot;A Girl and Five Brave Horses&quot;), and one of her most memorable moments on screen was in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;, when she danced a tango with Al Pacino, whose character was blind. She followed that with the films &quot;Body Snatchers&quot;, &quot;For Love or Money&quot;, and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. In 1994, &quot;People&quot; magazine named her one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. In 1995, she starred in &quot;Things to Do in Denver When You&#x27;re Dead&quot;.

In 2000, Anwar played Sophie in &quot;The Guilty&quot;. She also appeared in the television series &quot;John Doe&quot; (2002–2003) and acted in &quot;The Librarian: Return to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (2006). In 2007, she played Princess Margaret, sister of King Henry VIII, on Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Tudors&quot;. After that, she starred as Fiona Glenanne in the television series &quot;Burn Notice&quot; from 2007 to 2013. In 2008, Anwar made an appearance as Eva Sintzel, a woman trying to get pregnant through the fictitious Hudson Cryobank in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; episode &quot;Inconceivable&quot;. She also played a role in the seventh season of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Anwar was in a relationship with actor Craig Sheffer, with whom she has a daughter (born 1993). From 2000 to 2005, she was married to actor John Verea, with whom she has a son and a daughter. Sheffer is godfather to Anwar&#x27;s two children with Verea.

Anwar became a U.S. citizen in 2008.

In April 2010, Anwar began dating Shareef Malnik, son of Alvin Malnik. In August 2015, they were married in Montana. They live in Palm Island, Florida.

<doc id="953911" wikidata="Q4936105" url="?curid=953911" title="The Boca Raton Resort">
<text>The Boca Raton (often called the Boca Resort by locals) is a luxury resort and club in Boca Raton, Florida, founded in 1926, today comprising 1,047 hotel rooms across 337 acres. Its facilities include a 18-hole golf course, a 50,000 sq. ft. Forbes Five-Star spa, eight swimming pools, 30 tennis courts, a full-service 32-slip marina, more than 15 restaurants and bars, and 200,000 sq. ft. of meeting space.  The property fronts both Lake Boca (part of the Intracoastal Waterway) and the Atlantic Ocean. The resort was operated as part of Hilton&#x27;s Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts, and it is now privately owned by an affiliate of MSD Partners with the new name, The Boca Raton.

==History==

The resort first opened on February 6, 1926, as the 100-room Ritz-Carlton Cloister Inn. Originally designed and built by Boca Raton&#x27;s city planner, architect Addison Mizner, who intended Camino Real to be the main street of his new city, it was to have been one of two hotels, with the other being an oceanfront hotel. However, the Ritz-Carlton Investment Corporation became involved in the project and wanted the oceanfront hotel redesigned, so construction began on the smaller and financially more viable 100-room inn on the west side of Lake Boca Raton.

Mizner&#x27;s development company, hurt by the end of the Florida land boom of the 1920s and the 1926 Miami hurricane, declared bankruptcy in 1926. Philadelphia utility millionaire Clarence H. Geist bought its assets in 1927, and he expanded the Cloister Inn into the Boca Raton Club. The architectural firm Schultze and Weaver doubled the inn&#x27;s size, and a cabana club was constructed where the &quot;Addison on the Ocean&quot; condominium building now stands.

Subsequently, the U.S. Army used the club as barracks during World War II. Touted by officials as &quot;the most elegant barracks in history,&quot; it housed soldiers during the Boca Raton Army Air Field&#x27;s operation.

After the war, the Boca Raton Club&#x27;s ownership and ultimately name were changed. The Schine family purchased the club in 1944, renaming it the Boca Hotel and Club. While it was affectionately known on brochures as The Boca Raton, the resort was part of the identical Schine portfolio which included the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and the McAllister Hotel in Miami.


Arthur Vining Davis, whose brainchild was the Arvida Corporation, was responsible for modernizing the hotel. Opening the Boca Raton Club Tower in 1969, the building is still considerably taller than any other building in southern Palm Beach County. In addition, its famous &quot;Boca pink&quot; color has made it more famous than its stature of 300 feet (ninety-one meters) and twenty-seven floors, and it is commonly referred to as the &quot;pink hotel&quot;. Arvida also constructed the resort&#x27;s beach club in 1980, on the site that Mizner had intended the main hotel to stand on.

VMS Realty, Incorporated (Van Kampen, Morris, Stone), the successors to Arvida regarding ownership, purchased the property in 1983 and renamed it in 1988 as the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club.

In 2004, The Blackstone Group, a private investment firm, acquired the resort as part of its $1.25-billion acquisition of Boca Resorts, Inc., the publicly-traded owner and operator of five Florida resorts. In February 2009, the Beach Club finished a $150 million renovation, while the cloister and tower rooms were redesigned in 2006. In May 2009, Hilton announced that the resort would be the 13th property to join The Waldorf Astoria Collection.

MSD Partners L.P., led by Michael Dell, purchased the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club on June 4, 2019. The new owners, as of 2020, have made a proposal to invest $75 million for renovations to the hotel, restaurants, and amenities. The property continued to be managed by Hilton under the Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts brand until its departure in July 2021. As of July 12, 2021, the resort was renamed as The Boca Raton.

<doc id="953913" wikidata="Q1142349" url="?curid=953913" title="Emperor scorpion">
<text>The emperor scorpion (Pandinus imperator) is a species of scorpion native to rainforests and savannas in West Africa. It is one of the largest scorpions in the world and lives for six to eight years. Its body is black, but like other scorpions it glows pastel green or blue under ultraviolet light. It is a popular species in the pet trade, and is protected by CITES to prevent over-collecting that might affect the species&#x27; survival.

==Description==

The emperor scorpion (&quot;Pandinus imperator&quot;) is one of the largest species of scorpion in the world, with adults averaging about in length and a weight of 30 g. However, some species of forest scorpions are fairly similar to the emperor scorpion in size, and one scorpion, &quot;Heterometrus swammerdami&quot;, holds the record for being the world&#x27;s largest scorpion at 9 inches (23 cm) in length. The large pincers are blackish-red and have a granular texture. The front part of the body, or prosoma, is made up of four sections, each with a pair of legs. Behind the fourth pair of legs are comb-like structures known as pectines, which tend to be longer in males than in females. The tail, known as the metasoma, is long and curves back over the body. It ends in the large receptacle containing the venom glands and is tipped with a sharp, curved stinger. Scorpion stings can be categorized as mild (similar to a bee sting) to severe to humans depending on the species. Most people are not severely affected by the emperor scorpion&#x27;s sting, though some people may be allergic to scorpion stings in general. Sensory hairs cover the pincers and tail, enabling the emperor scorpion to detect prey through vibrations in the air and ground.

When gravid (pregnant), the body of a female expands to expose the whitish membranes connecting the segments. The emperor scorpion fluoresces greenish-blue under ultra-violet light.

They are known for their docile behavior and almost harmless sting; they do not use their sting to defend themselves when they are adults, however, they may use it in their adolescent stages. They prefer to use their pincers to crush and dismember their prey. Their exoskeleton is very sclerotic, causing them to have a metallic greenish-black color.

Emperor scorpions are often confused with a similar genus (&quot;Heterometrus&quot;), and are one of the most famous scorpions.

Different ion channel toxins have been isolated from the venom of the emperor scorpion, including Pi1, Pi2, Pi3, Pi4 and Pi7.

==Habitat and distribution==
The emperor scorpion is an African rainforest species, but also present in savanna. It is found in a number of African countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Togo, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Cameroon.

This species inhabits both tropical forest and open savannas. The emperor scorpion burrows beneath the soil and hides beneath rocks and debris, and also often burrows in termite mounds.

==Feeding habits==
In the wild, emperor scorpions primarily consume insects and other terrestrial invertebrates, although termites constitute a large portion of their diet. Larger vertebrates, such as rodents and lizards, are occasionally eaten. Emperor scorpions will burrow through termite mounds up to 6 feet deep in order to hunt prey. Their large claws help in tearing apart prey while their tail stinger injects venom at the same time for liquifying food. Juveniles rely on their venomous sting to paralyze prey while adults use their large claws to tear apart prey.

==Conservation and human impact==

African emperor scorpion venom contains the toxins imperatoxin and pandinotoxin.

Due to its docile nature, large size, and hardiness, &quot;P. imperator&quot; is a popular scorpion in the pet trade, which has led to such over-collecting in the wild that it is now a CITES-listed animal. They feed readily on crickets and worms available to keepers, and they can live up to 8 years in captivity. 

Despite their imposing size, emperor scorpion stings are usually mild, their venom does not cause severe symptoms in most people.

<doc id="953919" wikidata="Q2483674" url="?curid=953919" title="The Invisible Band">
<text>The Invisible Band is the third studio album by the Scottish rock band Travis, produced by Nigel Godrich. It was released on 11 June 2001 in the United Kingdom by Independiente and a day later in the United States by Epic Records. The songwriter, Fran Healy, said the title referred to the band&#x27;s status of having famous songs, but not being famous themselves. 

&quot;The Invisible Band&quot; spent four weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart, selling more copies in that time than their previous album, &quot;The Man Who&quot; (1999), achieved in six months.

== Recording ==
&quot;The Invisible Band&quot; was recorded at Ocean Way Recording, Los Angeles. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who also produced the previous Travis record, &quot;The Man Who&quot; (1999). According to the Travis songwriter, Fran Healy, Godrich arrived for the sessions in a bad mood. Healy said Godrich was frustrated after the gruelling recording sessions for Radiohead&#x27;s albums &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, and so &quot;took it out on us because he couldn&#x27;t take it out on Radiohead&quot;. 

Godrich was strict with Travis and rejected their initial work, which they found dispiriting. Eventually, after a serious argument, the mood settled. Healy felt it was good for Godrich to work with &quot;melodic&quot; bands such as Travis as well as more experimental acts such as Radiohead. The group began to make progress after a session experimenting with unusual instruments such as a tanpura.

==Critical reception==

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; received an average score of 71 based on 17 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Q&quot; wrote: &quot;While the wheel remains un-reinvented, &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; finds its mark with unerring accuracy&quot;. While Launch also said of the album, &quot;Songs like the stirring &#x27;Side&#x27;, the delicate &#x27;Dear Diary&#x27;, and the glistening &#x27;Follow the Light&#x27; are among the best and most fully crafted of Fran Healy&#x27;s short but accomplished writing career&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; also listed it as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.

<doc id="953920" wikidata="Q218884" url="?curid=953920" title="Cheryl Ladd">
<text>Cheryl Ladd (born Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor; July 12, 1951) is an American actress, singer, and author best known for her role as Kris Munroe in the ABC television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, whose cast she joined in its second season in 1977 to replace Farrah Fawcett-Majors. Ladd remained on the show until its cancellation in 1981. Her film roles include &quot;Purple Hearts&quot; (1984), &quot;Millennium&quot; (1989), &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; (1992), &quot;Permanent Midnight&quot; (1998), and &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (2017).

==Early life==
Ladd was born Cheryl Jean Stoppelmoor on July 12, 1951, in Huron, South Dakota, the second daughter of Dolores (née Katz), a waitress, and Marion Stoppelmoor, a railroad engineer. After high school, she traveled with the band The Music Shop and played in venues in the United States Midwest before settling in Los Angeles in 1970.

==Career==
===Early roles===
Ladd originally came to Hollywood to begin a career in music (she was known as &quot;Cherie Moor&quot; when she was the singing voice of Melody on Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; animated series, and she also sang on the 1970 album of the same name). However, she soon began to land non-singing roles in commercials and episodic television, including guest appearances on shows such as on &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, &quot;Search&quot; and &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

===&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1977–1981)===

Ladd&#x27;s big acting break came in 1977, when she was cast in the ABC television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels,&quot; replacing star Farrah Fawcett, who left the show after only one season to pursue a movie career. To make the transition easier for audiences, producers cast Ladd as Fawcett&#x27;s character&#x27;s younger sister, Kris, instantly making her a part of the &quot;Angels family&quot;. In the years to come, this practice of replacing Angels became a common event for the show. However, Ladd remained a part of the main cast for four seasons, until the show&#x27;s cancelation in June 1981.

While starring in the highly rated &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, Ladd took advantage of her newfound popularity to further her musical career, guest starring in musical-comedy variety series and specials, performing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl XIV in January 1980, and releasing three albums. She had a top-40 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single and a gold record.

<doc id="953921" wikidata="Q36504" url="?curid=953921" title="Sioux Lookout">
<text>Sioux Lookout is a town in Northwestern Ontario, Canada, with a population of 5,838 people (up 10.8% since 2016). Known locally as the &quot;Hub of the North&quot;, it is serviced by the Sioux Lookout Airport, Highway 72, and the Sioux Lookout railway station. According to a 2011 study commissioned by the municipality, health care and social services ranked as the largest sources of employment, followed by the retail trade, public administration, transportation and warehousing, manufacturing, accommodation and food services, and education.

Although downtown Sioux Lookout is located from the Trans-Canada Highway, the municipality covers the ends or beginnings of provincial highways 664, 642, 516, and 72. Sioux Lookout is also a key airport hub for numerous northern and Indigenous communities in Northwestern Ontario and remains a service stop for &quot;The Canadian&quot;, a transcontinental passenger train operated by Via Rail, and a busy railway junction for the northwestern Ontario segment of Canadian National Railway&#x27;s transcontinental Class 1 railroad.

Fishing camps in the area allow access to an extensive lake system fed by the English River. The town is surrounded by several beaches, including Umphreville Park, a historical site that predates the town itself. During the summer months, Sioux Lookout&#x27;s population rises as tourists, mostly American, arrive to take advantage of the multitude of lakes and rivers in the area. Experienced guides, employed by the camps, can locate the best locations and also provide an educated tour of the unique land known affectionately as &quot;sunset country&quot;.

== History ==

Sioux Lookout&#x27;s name comes from a First Nations story and a local mountain, Sioux Mountain, which served as a lookout point for the Ojibwe people. Being able to scan the surrounding area for some distance enabled the Ojibwe men to potentially detect any approaching Sioux warriors, with sufficient time to guide the women and children to safety before intercepting the enemies. From Sioux Mountain, a careful eye could catch the sun reflecting off of birch bark canoes crossing the nearby rapids. Illustrating this old story on the front page of the local newspaper, &quot;The Sioux Lookout Bulletin&quot;, is an iconic image of a First Nations man, holding a hand above his eyes as he scans the water and surrounding terrain.

Sioux Lookout was incorporated in 1912, and was a terminal and junction on the National Transcontinental Railway. For many years, Sioux Lookout was simply a railway town. At one point, gold was discovered in Red Lake; the town subsequently became one of the leading Canadian aviation centres during the 1920s and 1930s. From circa 1933 to 1937, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company operated a fur-trade post at the town along the English River near the north shore of Minnitaki Lake.

During the Cold War, from 1952 to 1967, CFS Sioux Lookout, west, was a radar base forming part of the Pinetree Line to monitor any activity from the Soviet Union.

Today, the Canadian National Railway (CNR) is a significant employer, although it is no longer the largest employer in the area, nor is the forest products industry; Sioux Lookout has become a hub of various services catering to northern First Nations communities, such as healthcare, human and social services and education, among others. Additionally, both the provincial and federal government are major employers within Sioux Lookout. As a result, the town barely felt the effects of the recession in the early 1980s. However, more significant demographic and employment changes took place around the time of the global financial crisis and recession of 2008-09; notably, the permanent closure of the lumber mill in Hudson, along with the construction of a newer, larger healthcare complex (the Meno Ya Win Health Centre), saw several shifts in the local workforce. New and different positions were subsequently made available through the Health Centre, which also brought new workers to the area.

Urban Sioux Lookout looks-out on Pelican Lake, and the municipality has initiated a lakefront improvement program to beautify this area. There are now more parks, paths, and other recreational options and amenities along the lake and surrounding lands. Numerous other lakes, rivers and water-focused activities are easily accessible, by car or boat, from Sioux Lookout. Tourism makes a significant contribution to the local economy, however, there is far more capacity for development, and the area&#x27;s potential is only starting to be recognized fully.

<doc id="953935" wikidata="Q4681267" url="?curid=953935" title="Addison Mizner">
<text>Addison Cairns Mizner ( ) (December 12, 1872 – February 5, 1933) was an American architect whose Mediterranean Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival style interpretations changed the character of southern Florida, where the style is continued by architects and land developers. During the 1920s Mizner was perhaps the best-known living American architect. Palm Beach, Florida, which he &quot;transformed&quot;, was his home, and most of his houses are there. He believed that architecture should also include interior and garden design, and initiated the company Mizner Industries to have a reliable source of components. He was &quot;an architect with a philosophy and a dream&quot;. Boca Raton, Florida, an unincorporated small farming town that was established in 1896, became the site of Mizner&#x27;s most famous development project.

The , &quot;bon vivant&quot; epitomized the &quot;society architect&quot;. Rejecting other modern architects for &quot;producing a characterless copybook effect&quot;, he sought to &quot;make a building look traditional and as though it had fought its way from a small, unimportant structure to a great, rambling house that took centuries of different needs and ups and downs of wealth to accomplish. I sometimes start a house with a Romanesque corner, pretend that it has fallen into disrepair and been added to in the Gothic spirit, when suddenly the great wealth of the New World has poured in and the owner had added a very rich Renaissance addition.&quot; Or as he described his own never-built castle, drawings of which were part of his promotional literature, it would be &quot;a Spanish fortress of the twelfth century captured from its owner by a stronger enemy who, after taking it, adds on one wing and another, and then loses it in turn to another who builds to suit his taste&quot;. As these quotes suggest, many Mizner buildings contain styles from more than one period, but all foreign.

==Biography==
Born in Benicia, at the time &quot;the educational center of California&quot;, and (briefly) its state capital, he traveled as a child with his father, Lansing B. Mizner, a lawyer, former President of the California Senate and the U. S. Minister to Central America, based in Guatemala.
As a young man, he visited China in 1893, was briefly a gold miner in the Yukon (1898–99) (Canada, not Alaska). Of his seven siblings, six of them boys, he was closest to his younger brother Wilson, though his disreputable behavior caused Addison many problems. He had a macaw parrot. and kept as pets a series of monkeys, which often rode on his shoulder; his favorite had a headstone at his grave, identifying him as &quot;Johnnie Brown, The Human Monkey, Died April 30, 1927&quot;. 
In 1932 Mizner published &quot;The Many Mizners&quot;, an autobiography covering his youth, year mining, and time in New York until the death of his mother. A second volume telling of his life in Florida was begun but never completed; the Palm Beach Historical Society has the typed manuscript. Mizner died in 1933 of heart failure in Palm Beach and is buried in the family vault at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park.

According to Donald Curl, author of &quot;Mizner&#x27;s Florida&quot;,

He was just completely outgoing and basically a really good guy. One of the things he was noted for was the kindness toward the people who worked for him and the courtesy he showed them. Some of the other architects of this era were almost the reverse; they saw the other architects as their employees, and they should have nothing to do with the design other than putting it on paper. Mizner was not that way. When the bust began in Florida, he actually helped some of the young architects get established elsewhere.
The vast majority of Mizner&#x27;s employees developed an affection for and allegiance to him: &quot;It was a pleasure working for Mizner&quot;, one remarked.

==Mizner&#x27;s Hispanism==
Addison accompanied his father when the latter travelled to Guatemala in August 1889 to begin his duties there. His first stop, aged 15, on the boat to Guatemala was Mazatlán, Mexico. This was Addison&#x27;s first direct contact with the Hispanic world, which he described as &quot;the greatest day of my life&quot;. His father Lansing Mizner spoke fluent Spanish, as did his paternal step-grandfather, James Semple, also a U.S. diplomat in Spanish America. Addison, who became fluent, after some tutoring enrolled at the Instituto Nacional in Guatemala City, &quot;where we learned that boys fought with knives and not with fists&quot;. He remained there for a year, visiting Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras with his father, before returning to California in 1890 to study at the Bates School, a boarding school in San Rafael, California. His studies there ended in 1891 because of his brother Wilson&#x27;s expulsion for misbehavior. He continued his studies briefly at Boone&#x27;s College in Berkeley, California, with the hope of passing the entrance examination for the University of California (presently the University of California, Berkeley). Either he never presented himself for the examination, or he failed it. In any event, that was the end of his formal education.

In his own words:
I have based my design largely on the old architecture of Spain — with important modifications and to meet Florida conditions. I studied the architecture of Spain itself and drew somewhat on my knowledge of Spanish tropical America.

In one of his advertisements:
Spanish Art in Boca Raton homes adds a special charm to these dwellings, in a land of tropical beauty where the softness of the South makes life easy.
He also assembled an excellent library on Spanish and Spanish Colonial architecture, which has survived and is now administered by the Historical Society of Palm Beach County.

The first idea of Mizner about his first Florida building, now the Everglades Club, was that it should contain &quot;a Moorish tower&quot;, a clear reference to the Alhambra, which Mizner visited and commented on. The Mediterranean Revival style Mizner introduced to South Florida was not Turkish or Italian, it was Spanish, specifically of the hottest, southern part of Spain, Andalucía; colonial Guatemala had similar architecture. He taught workmen to make Spanish red roof tiles, appropriate for the climate. A scholar states that Mizner&#x27;s mature style was &quot;founded upon the architecture of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain&quot;, although the Alhambra is older and Guatemala was primarily the workmanlike eighteenth- and nineteenth-century architecture of the south of Spain. Like a colonial Spanish architect would have, in many cases he worked without paper plans.

Many of Mizner&#x27;s projects have Spanish names: El Mirasol, El Solano, La Ronda (discussed below), and others. In his never-realized plan for Boca Raton, between the present Palmetto Park Road and Hillsboro Boulevard, the main street, El Camino Real, has a Spanish name, though, in another of his fanciful stories, he claimed it was inspired by Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Botafogo neighborhood. (What Mizner&#x27;s commissioned painting on the cover of his first (1925) brochure does resemble in Rio de Janeiro, is the :pt:Canal do Mangue, which runs down the middle of a wide street, but is nowhere near Botafogo, which he may have mentioned because it seemed like a more elegant name (&quot;Mouth of Fire&quot;) than Mangue &quot;mangrove&quot;.) Streets east of the future Seaboard Coast Line Railroad line (where an &quot;Addison Station&quot; was to be constructed) had Spanish personal names: Ponce de Leon, Gonzalo, Juan, Isabel, Hernando, as well as Montazuma , and Noche Triste. To the west they were to have the names of small Spanish cities: Tarragona, Cordoba, Toledo, Alcante (, for Alicante), Burgos, Palencia, Lucena, the palace/monastery Escorial, and even small towns: Monreal (name of several towns), Munera. In the planned Spanish Village neighborhood (&quot;Mizner Plat 11&quot;), projected streets had Spanish names: the main Alvarado Road, and crossing it, fanciful names, not all of which are visible in the photograph: Ébano, Feraz, Grúa, Haz, Ídolo, Jasmine, Kay, Labio, Malvis, Nao, Orear, Prado, Quevedo, Rocinante, and Salerno. The different types of pottery produced by Mizner Industries each had the name of a Spanish city.

==Mizner the humorist==
In 1903 Mizner provided illustrations for &quot;The Limerick Up to Date Book&quot; of Ethel Watts Mumford (San Francisco: Paul Elder). It says something about Mizner that he would illustrate this poem:

In 1902, with Oliver Herford and Ethel Watts Mumford, he published an annual illustrated &quot;The Complete Cynic. Being Bunches of Wisdom Culled from the Calendars of Oliver Herford, Ethel Watts Mumford, Addison Mizner&quot;.

*The Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1903
*The Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1904
*The Entirely New Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1905
*The Complete Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1906
*The Altogether New Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1907
*The Quite New Cynic&#x27;s Calendar of Revised Wisdom for 1908
*The Perfectly Good Cynic&#x27;s Calendar&quot; (1908)
*The Complete Cynic (1910)
*The Revived Cynic&#x27;s Calendar (1917)

This produced such sayings as: &quot;A woman&#x27;s mind is cleaner than a man&#x27;s. She changes it more often&quot; and &quot;Many are called but few get up&quot;.

==Mizner the storyteller==
Mizner was a storyteller but not a reliable one. He invented stories, all set in foreign countries and thus in practice unverifiable. One the lack of veracity of which is documented is the tale of his visit with his father and other family members to the ruins of Copán, in Honduras. &quot;No one knew exactly where it was&quot;, and they needed &quot;a small army of carriers and machete wielders to cut our way in&quot;. John Lloyd Stephens was &quot;the only other white man to set foot on the temple steps in three hundred and seventy years&quot;. However, at least six other white men visited and wrote about Copán in the 19th century, not counting the expeditions of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. His well-informed father, the U.S. ambassador, surely knew about some of these visitors. Mizner also omitted embarrassing information: he said his father retired as ambassador because &quot;father&#x27;s health broke down&quot;, when in fact his father was dismissed by Secretary of State James G. Blaine after a diplomatic incident.

It was on this journey that he received his first monkey, named Deuteronomy, who drowned, on the return voyage from Nicaragua to Guatemala, after she was hit on the head with a trombone (n.b.) and fell overboard.

As he told it in a totally fictitious tale, he laid out the town of Dawson Creek, British Columbia, with no tape measure. He told a story about how, in 1892, Argelia Benton (:es:Argelia Benton), the American wife of Guatemalan dictator Jose Maria Reina Barrios, invited him to build a new palace for her in Guatemala City. He was to receive a retainer of $25,000 in gold, but Barrios was assassinated before Mizner received any of the money. Mizner&#x27;s dramatic story is not evidenced by the chronology: her residence/palace, Villa Argelia, already existed in 1892, and Barrios was assassinated in 1898.

Much later, Addison said several times that he enrolled &quot;at some point during this time&quot; in the University of Salamanca, in Spain, though the only known detail about his studies there, if they existed, is that he did not receive a degree. There is no confirmation that he ever studied there (and Salamanca&#x27;s isolation makes it an unlikely choice for a foreign student). The only cities in Spain that it is documented that he visited are Seville, Granada, Toledo, and Burgos.

So much as available evidence indicates, he was never in the small city of Salamanca. However, because of its prestigious and mellifluous name, Salamanca was mentioned by Mizner repeatedly.
* According to Mizner, the Spanish king, Alfonso XIII, came to his hotel, insisted on seeing him, and gave him paneling from &quot;the private apartments of [fifteenth-century] King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain in Salamanca.&quot; There were no such apartments in Salamanca.
* Mizner also said that the entry to the Cloister Inn was through &quot;a large Romanesque arch reminiscent of the entrance gate of the University of Salamanca&quot;. There is no Romanesque architecture in Salamanca. 
* The Cloister Inn had a &quot;Salamanca Room&quot;.
* The huge doors of the Cloister Inn were said to be &quot;three-hundred-year-old originals from the University of Salamanca&quot;. In reality, these doors were made of Dade County pine in the workshops of Mizner Industries.&quot;
* The ceiling of the house La Bienvenida was &quot;inspired by a cloister ceiling at the library at the University of Salamanca&quot;.

Mizner told this kind of story to his clients: in Playa Riente, its &quot;ceiling was from the Chapter House in Toledo, Spain, and the tracery of the doors and windows from the Casa Lonja at Valencia.&quot; There was also a yellow carpet &quot;reputed to have been woven by nuns for a cathedral in Granada.&quot; (There were no carpets at all, much less ones made by nuns, in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries.) He never showed photographs or prints in books of the buildings he was allegedly imitating.

A similar Hispanic tale told several times by Mizner is that his administration buildings (in 2017 the Addison Restaurant) was based on the house of the Spanish painter El Greco, in Toledo, Spain. As Mizner surely knew, El Greco&#x27;s house was long vanished, little is known of it, and the house/museum of El Greco in Toledo, recently constructed and opened in Mizner&#x27;s day (1911), made no pretense to even be in the same location as the original house. Mizner did not follow the somber architectural style of Castile, where Toledo was, and a similarity between the two buildings is difficult to see. Similarly, he invented the connection between the tower of the Cloister Inn, which is vaguely Spanish, with the Giralda tower of the Cathedral of Seville. The San Francisco Ferry Building (1892) — a project of his mentor Polk (see below) — does have a tower that clearly resembles the Seville tower. Two contemporaneous buildings in south Florida also contain towers based on the Giralda: the Freedom Tower (Miami) (1925) and the Miami Biltmore Hotel (1926), both products of the architectural company Schultze and Weaver, who in 1927 built the Boca Raton Club that Mizner could not.

(The feature of the Everglades Club that &quot;is&quot; linked to the Giralda is the Patio of Oranges: that is the garden of the Cathedral/former great mosque of Seville, where the Giralda is.)

Similarly, he said that he traveled with his father to San José, Costa Rica, by river, which is impossible: San José is at , and is not even close to a navigable river. He embellished it further by adding that they had missed a steamer and had to travel by dugout canoe; there have never been dugout canoes in Costa Rica. He said that he based a dining hall, with multiple wash stations, on a &quot;hospital&quot; in Vic, Spain; there is no such building in Vic. He also invented a prize fight in Australia; he had a lifelong leg injury and could not possibly box. But he said he fought the boxing champion of Australia to a draw after twenty rounds (&quot;he was slow and ... I was fast&quot;), and in a rematch knocked out and probably killed his opponent. He had to escape out the back door with his share of the gate, head for the harbor, and board a ship whose gangplank was conveniently just being drawn up. One wonders what to make of his claim that he was &quot;as good a bricklayer as any man I ever had. I can plaster as well as any plasterer I have seen. I am a fairly good carpenter, a better than ordinary electrician. I know how to wipe a joint in plumbing.&quot; Similarly, &quot;I had to go into the nursery business and build a tree-moving machine. What fun it was teaching men how to stucco, teaching others how to cure pip in chickens, clearing jungles, killing land crabs, catching alligators. It was all like a game.&quot;

==Mizner&#x27;s buying trips==
He returned to Guatemala for a few months in 1904. His original plan, never implemented, was to buy coffee to sell in the U.S. (This turned later into a nonexistent coffee plantation that he bought.) Instead, realizing how many antiquities were available for modest amounts, especially in Guatemala&#x27;s abandoned former capital Antigua, he began collecting Hispanic antiquities. He purchased an old monastery – the whole building. &quot;The reason I wanted it was that eight of the side chapels of the church were intact and in each stood, thirty feet high, carved wood altars with heavy gilding.&quot; He also returned with a book of sketches of the architectural features of Antigua. This was a turning point in his decision to become an architect.

Relocating to New York in 1904, he filled his apartment with his Guatemala purchases: rich velvet and damask vestments, ornate carved church paneling, reliquaries, gilded candlesticks, and other rare ornaments. He made &quot;good money&quot; selling them to visitors.

In 1905, Mizner visited Spain for the first time; after that, he visited Europe every year. After relocating to Florida, these visits occurred during the &quot;off&quot; season. In 1924, Mizner went on a buying trip to Spain, scouring antique shops, buying &quot;furiously&quot; thousands of items: wrought iron, tapestries, furniture, grillwork, and whole staircases. He was accompanied by one of his clients, Eleanor Cosden, who is reported to have recalled &quot;the guide in the church in Toledo who, Addison pointed out, got several things wrong,&quot; and that &quot;he even straightened out our host, the Duke of Alba!&quot; (The Duke of Alba, one of the richest men in Spain, visited Palm Beach in 1926.) In 1926 he went on a similar visit, abbreviated by the financial crisis.

==Mizner&#x27;s homosexuality==
Mizner has been described as &quot;an early influential gay man in South Florida&quot;, &quot;the gay father of South Florida architecture.&quot; He is portrayed as openly homosexual in the Stephen Sondheim — John Weidman musical &quot;Road Show&quot;. Mizner described himself as a &quot;lifelong bachelor&quot;, after &quot;a few unsuccessful relationships with women in California and New York&quot;. One modern researcher says that &quot;Wilson loved women sexually; Addison cherished their friendship and companionship.&quot; He tells us, in &quot;The Many Mizners&quot;, that he &quot;fell desperately in love with Bertha Dolbeer&quot;, but the love did not last long, as she &quot;had fallen out of a window at the Waldorf-Astoria and had been instantly killed&quot;. At the same time, when he was living in San Francisco, he had &quot;an emotional relationship with a young man, Jack Baird&quot;. He described a buying trip to Europe with Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Thayer, &quot;a wicked little devil&quot;, as &quot;the happiest two months of my life&quot;. (His story that he had had a &quot;love affair with the president [of Guatemala]&#x27;s daughter&quot; is fictitious.)

Although at that period he could not be open, his biographer Caroline Seebohm said &quot;his mature sexual taste was for very young men&quot;, &quot;pretty boys with pretensions,&quot; and he had &quot;a series of young boys in tow&quot; during his later years. One of these &quot;young and handsome&quot; men was Alex Waugh, who accompanied Mizner on buying trips and ended up manager of the antiques and reproduction furniture store for Mizner Industries. When Waugh sent recollections of Mizner to biographer Alva Johnston, they were &quot;quite unprintable&quot;. Another was Horace Chase, his &quot;wild, thoroughly-likeable&quot; nephew, for two years the manager of the &quot;virtually inoperable pottery factory, &#x27;Las Manos&#x27; [&#x27;The Hands&#x27;]&quot;, which he bought from Paris Singer. &quot;Jack Roy was a memorable young man whom Addison made manager of his furniture factory despite his having no experience whatsoever in management or any familiarity with artisanship ... Addison met Jerry Girandolle in New York and, after giving him a new Cadillac, also made him manager of the furniture factory [Jack having departed]. Later, Addison was attracted to the young painter he used on the Cosden house, Achille Angeli, &#x27;a strikingly handsome young fellow&#x27;.&quot;

==Early architectural career==

Little is known about Addison Mizner&#x27;s sketches and artwork prior to his architectural career; he did brag in 1893 of having sold six pictures for $150. His subsequent work shows him to be a fine draftsman and an artist who painted beautiful watercolors.

Although he lacked formal university training, Mizner served a 3-year apprenticeship (1894–1897) in the office of San Francisco architect Willis Jefferson Polk, eventually becoming a partner. Polk was only five years older than Addison and was not committed to any architectural style. &quot;His [Mizner&#x27;s] architectural training rivaled that of many in the profession of his day.&quot;

In 1904 he relocated to New York City, and then to nearby Port Washington, Long Island. During his first five years in New York, Mizner never built a house. The commissions he did receive were for interior design, which in two cases were the interior of yachts, and in designing gardens. Eventually he designed numerous country houses across Long Island and the region. In 1907, he and William Massarene designed White Pine Camp, a retreat in the Adirondack Mountains, later used by U. S. President Calvin Coolidge as his &quot;Summer White House&quot;. He also designed Rock Hall in Connecticut and the main house of the Hitchcock Estate in Dutchess County, New York.

==Florida==

In January 1918, aged 46, Mizner visited Palm Beach, Florida for his health, at the suggestion of Paris Singer, whose house guest he was. He was &quot;prepared to die&quot;, but instead recovered. He decided to stay. The existing architecture in Palm Beach was wooden – Flagler&#x27;s two hotels, the Royal Poinciana and The Breakers (burned 1925), were wooden — and in a style better suited for colder weather, Mizner tells us. Familiar from Guatemala with Hispanic warm climate architecture, he chose it as a style more appropriate for South Florida. His Mediterranean Revival designs won the attention and patronage of wealthy clients, who preferred to build their own individual ocean-front mansions. Constructed of stone, tile, and stucco, his buildings were better suited to Florida&#x27;s semi-tropical climate (and threat of hurricanes) than the wooden shingle-style resort architecture imported from the Northeast. As a result of Mizner, &quot;Palm Beach was transformed.&quot;. Mizner &quot;designed with the wealthy in mind&quot;; people &quot;began building private residences on a grand scale.&quot; As a result in large part of Mizner, &quot;by 1925 Palm Beach had established itself as &quot;the&quot; resort community of the United States.&quot;

Mizner&#x27;s concept of architect was that he did not just design a building, but also its interior decoration and gardens.

His houses were generally one room deep to allow cross-ventilation, with kitchens located in wings to keep their heat away from living areas. Kitchens were also located downwind of the dining area. They were built with courtyards on various levels, replete with arcades and lofty galleries; rooms featured exposed rafters and vaulted ceilings; tiled pools and mosaics were said to resemble those of Pompeii (if that is not another of Mizner&#x27;s exaggerations). Other characteristic features included loggias, colonnades, clusters of columns supporting arches, French doors, casement windows, barrel tile roofs, hearths, grand stairways and decorative ironwork.

===The Everglades Club===

Mizner&#x27;s first big commission, and the project that made him famous, was the Everglades Club, which opened in January 1919. It was a &quot;revelation&quot; and its architectural effect &quot;cannot be exaggerated&quot;. Another scholar says that Mizner &quot;revolutionized Palm Beach architecture&quot;.
No one had seen anything like it: a &quot;gorgeous pink stucco palace, with arcades, wrought-iron balconies, and terra-cotta-tile roofs.&quot; There were two four-hundred-year-old doors, and chairs of the same antiquity. Hispanic tiles were everywhere. &quot;It took the place by storm&quot;, said Singer years later. An even larger project, the 147-room mansion El Mirasol (demolished), followed in 1919. Mizner received many subsequent commissions, in what was the most successful part of his career. From 1919 to 1924 he designed about thirty-eight houses in Palm Beach. His clients were wealthy and socially prominent: Gurnee Munn, John Shaffer Phipps, Barclay Harding Warburton II, Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr., Edward Shearson, Rodman Wanamaker, Paul Moore Sr., and Eva Stotesbury among them. For them, he created &quot;a Mediterranean village&quot;.

===Mizner Industries===
To make materials for the Everglades Club, he and Paris Singer purchased a small facility and began the manufacture of roof and floor tiles, with a sideline production of ironwork and furniture. The factory also made pottery; Mizner viewed pottery as something that &quot;could be effectively used to integrate an indoor and outdoor color scheme.&quot; The factory was called &quot;Las Manos&quot; (&quot;The Hands&quot;), referring to the way products were made there: &quot;con las manos&quot;, with our hands, by hand.

After the Club was completed in 1919, Singer sold Mizner his interest in the factory, which prospered. In West Palm Beach, &quot;just east of the railroad,&quot; by 1925 Mizner Industries Incorporated was making, according to its catalog, &quot;pottery, roof and floor tile, period furniture, wicker, upholstering, repairing, antique millwork and hardware, bronze sash, wrought iron, stained and leaded glass windows, reconstructed and ornamental stone, and imitation marble.&quot; It was one of the largest manufacturing companies in Palm Beach County. Mizner lacked the talent for making conventional plans and specifications. Everything was done off-the-cuff. Plans for one house were drawn in the sand on the beach. He was a pioneer in developing artificial or cast stone, a combination of coquina shell, lime, and a cement mixture. He also used &quot;woodite&quot;, a composite material with a wood component, which could be poured and molded. As a result, Mizner Industries sold &quot;precast plastering&quot;, highly ornate plaster coffered ceilings and mouldings, and with woodite, besides antique-style doors, the paneling of a complete room, all at a relatively low cost. &quot;One of the major difficulties in identifying Mizner buildings is the presence of Mizner Industries stonework on non-Mizner buildings&quot;; a number of buildings he did not build are frequently misattributed to him.

Mizner Industries, copying imported antiques or photographs, manufactured beds, tables, taborets, chests, dressing tables, wardrobes, &quot;all pieces of furniture imaginable.&quot; There were two qualities: &quot;a superior, handcrafted line ... extremely difficult to distinguish from authentic Spanish antiques,&quot; and another &quot;good, sturdy line with little or no hand attention.&quot;

===Mizner&#x27;s Florida style===
Mizner was anything but a follower of styles. He would improvise a building&#x27;s design as he went; he was someone who &quot;would take a lot of liberties&quot;, who &quot;let his imagination run riot&quot;. In the end, Mizner would create a pink-walled, red-tiled, wrought iron-gated world of unreal luxury. Developers loved the Mizner style because it gave their brand-new developments an air of established, Old World elegance. It was imitated in new developments in the Florida peninsula. &quot;It is style,&quot; said Donald Curl. &quot;As an architect, he introduced Mediterranean revival, or Spanish revival, or whatever you wanted to call it. He made it not only popular but fashionable. Mizner was someone who was willing to take a lot of liberties and design buildings that were good for the climate and the lifestyle of the people who were his clients.&quot; &quot;I never begin to design a home without first imagining some sort of romance about it. Once I have my story, then the plans take place easily.&quot;

Mizner created a version of Spanish style that was appropriate to twentieth-century Florida.
The loggia room has survived as the Florida room. The changing room is now an essential. The focal point, now swimming pool with bridge or hanging basket chair, creates the necessary element of excitement. Native building materials are touted. Red tile remains a precious commodity. Pastel colors prevail. Meandering streets with boutiques are today&#x27;s key to a successful commercial adventure. The advantages of mixed residential and commercial use have become obvious.
===&quot;Antiquing&quot; buildings===
To get the all-important appearance of antiquity Mizner inflicted vandalism. He deliberately smudged up new rooms with burning pots of tarpaper, took penknife to woodwork and statuary, chipped tiles, used acid to rust the iron, made wormholes with an icepick, cracked a mantle with a sledgehammer, all creating what he called &quot;the kiss of the centuries.&quot; He hired inexperienced help to lay roof tiles awry, and once had men in hobnailed boots walk up and down a stairway before the cement set to get the effect of centuries of wear. One of his original contributions to architecture was the discovery that worm-eaten cypress gave the desired effect of age; thus &quot;pecky&quot; cypress, weak and worthless for structural elements, suddenly became the mahogany paneling of Palm Beach.

==Selected buildings==

*An oceanfront Palm Beach estate was once owned by the late John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono Named El Solano. Located on South Ocean Boulevard, popularly referred to as Billionaires&#x27; Row, the house is next door to a property owned by author James Patterson, records show.
*Mizner designed the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York, in 1912.
*Mizner&#x27;s first major Florida commission was the Everglades Club, a Spanish-mission-style convalescent retreat built in 1918, that became (and remains) a private club. It stands at 4 Via Parigi (off Worth Avenue) in Palm Beach.
*Mizner designed the 37-room El Mirasol (&quot;the sunflower&quot;), completed in 1919, for investment banker Edward T. Stotesbury, head of the town&#x27;s most notable family of the time. It included a 40-car garage, a tea house, an auditorium and a private zoo. The mansion stood at 348 N. Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, but was demolished in the 1950s.
*La Bellucia, at 1200 South Ocean Boulevard, was built in 1920 for Dr. Willey Lyon Kingsley. In 2009 it was Palm Beach&#x27;s largest recorded sale at $24 million.
*Also in 1920, Mizner built a grand Palm Beach estate home called Costa Bella (&quot;beautiful coast&quot;) at 111 Dunbar Road for Elizabeth Hope Gammell Slater. Her father was Prof. William Gammell, and her grandfather was Robert Ives of the firm Brown and Ives. In a story published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1882, her mother was &quot;reckoned the richest woman in America, her property placed at twenty millions or more.&quot; Addison Mizner used his primary builder and contractor at that time, Cooper C. Lightbown, who later became the Town of Palm Beach&#x27;s Mayor from 1922 to 1927.
:In his book &quot;Mizner&#x27;s Florida&quot;, author and historian Donald W. Curl noted the home&#x27;s &quot;massive stone staircase&quot; and that the home was more formal than Mizner&#x27;s typical work. This formality is seen in such details as the pure Belgian black marble he used in the entrance foyer, and one of the first uses of terrazzo flooring for the 1920s showcased in the palatial dining hall. Furthermore, Curl notes the &quot;stalactite&quot; lighting fixture and gothic tracery for the dining room ceiling. It is believed that Mizner replicated the plasterwork in the dining room from photographs of the Alhambra that he had taken from his travels in Spain. Costa Bella&#x27;s massive ballroom and dining hall feature grandiose palladian windows and french doors. Hence, historian Curl comments that, &quot;the extensive fenestration created an open and light vacation house.&quot; Costa Bella is the quintessential example of Mizner&#x27;s architectural majesty encompassing all the elements and building materials he is famous for: towering hand-stenciled wood beamed cypress ceilings, coral stone flooring, antique tiles, elaborate decorative columns and corbels, unique light fixtures, stone carvings and stone-carved fireplace mantels.
*In 1922, Mizner built the William Gray Warden Residence (Warden House) at 112 Seminole Ave, Palm Beach, which is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
*Another fanciful Palm Beach mansion, Villa Flora, was built in 1923 for Edward Shearson. It stands at 110 Dunbar Road.
*La Querida (&quot;the dear one&quot;), apocryphally conflated with La Guerida (&quot;bounty of war&quot;), was built in Palm Beach in 1923 for Rodman Wanamaker of Philadelphia, heir to the Wanamaker&#x27;s department store fortune. It was later purchased by Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. in 1933 during the depths of the Great Depression for $120,000, and eventually would become President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Winter White House&quot;. It sold for $70,000,000 in June 2020. It stands at 1095 N. Ocean Boulevard.
*As early as 1925, Mizner was commissioned by Dr and Mrs (Lillian) Thomas Dempsey to build a beautiful, diminutive Mediterranean Revival summer home (possibly the smallest structure Mizner ever built). The house has 22&#x27; ceilings, enabling the architect to install a &quot;mezzanine-loggia,&quot; encircled by the hand-wrought iron railings for which a classic Mizner building is known. The house, at 100 S. Osborne Avenue, Margate, New Jersey (formerly 8704 Atlantic Ave) is on a beach block corner where Atlantic Ave intersects Osborne. (A stone&#x27;s throw away, another architectural landmark, known as Lucy the Elephant, holds court at the corner of Atlantic and Washington Avenues.) Jeff Rosen of Spielberg Productions, who purchased the home from the Dempsey estate, later sold it to Marsha &amp; Michael Birnbaum of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. It has since been purchased and is occupied by auteur-singer-poet Silkë Berlinn.
*Mizner&#x27;s own Palm Beach home was built in 1925. It was called El Solano after the hot, oppressive wind which blows off the Mediterranean Sea in eastern Spain, but also for Solano County, California, his birthplace. Sold to Harold Vanderbilt, the estate was later purchased by John Lennon. It stands at 720 S. Ocean Boulevard.
*He designed and built the Riverside Baptist Church in Jacksonville, completed in 1926. Because he promised to build it in honor of his mother, Ella Watson Mizner, the architect refused payment for his services. The church stands at 2650 Park Street, and is Mizner&#x27;s only work of religious architecture.
*The clubhouse for the Wee Burn Country Club in Darien, Connecticut was designed by Mizner in his Mediterranean style in 1926.
*A mansion of , with a guest house, was built at 1820 S. Ocean Blvd. for Paul Moore Sr. (completed 1926). After a two-year renovation-and-restoration project, the property was listed for sale in 2018 for $58,000,000.
*In 1928, he designed the original Cloister Hotel at Sea Island, Georgia. It was demolished in 2003.
*Mizner also built a Mediterranean Revival mansion in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1929, La Ronda. It was demolished on October 1, 2009. Some architectural elements were salvaged.

==Mizner Mile==
In Boynton Beach, Florida, between Palm Beach and the future Boca Raton, Mizner&#x27;s first vision of a &quot;comprehensive ocean city&quot; was a mile-long resort. &quot;Mizner Mile, situated on [what is today (2018)] Old Ocean Boulevard, was to include a club, polo fields, houses designed by Mizner, and a two-thousand-room hotel modeled on &#x27;the lines of a Spanish monastery&#x27;.&quot; He planned to exchange the design of a new Boynton City Hall for city commissioners&#x27; permission to build his hotel and club. The project (1924–1925) went aground, and Mizner abandoned it, after locals strongly opposed the relocation of Old Ocean Boulevard – a new road was built and the original road was to be destroyed – to allow beachfront lots. He designed plans for a never-built Boynton Woman&#x27;s Club without fee &quot;in an effort to make amends to the city&quot;.

==Boca Raton development==
In 1925 Addison Mizner embarked on his most ambitious project, what he called his &quot;culminating achievement&quot;: the creation of a fabulous resort at Boca Raton. He claimed that it would offer more than Palm Beach, and was &quot;undoubtedly the most tremendous land development project ever launched in the state of Florida.&quot; The city was incorporated in 1924 and immediately appointed him city planner. Boca Raton&#x27;s original City Hall, which currently houses the city&#x27;s Welcome Center and the Boca Raton History Museum, began as his project, though because of the bankruptcy of Mizner Industries he did not complete it, and it is more modest than he planned.

He began by forming the Mizner Development Corporation, a syndicate of prominent investors including Rodman Wanamaker, Paris Singer, Irving Berlin, William Kissam Vanderbilt II, Elizabeth Arden, Jesse Livermore, Clarence H. Geist, and T. Coleman du Pont as chairman. In March the corporation quietly bought up of ocean-front property with an overall total of over . On April 15, 1925, the syndicate announced this large development, labeled the &quot;Venice of the Atlantic&quot;, which would feature a thousand-room hotel, two golf courses, a polo field, parks, and miles of paved and landscaped streets which included a grand boulevard called El Camino Real. In an address before 100 salespeople, the architect declared:

It is my plan to create a city that is direct and simple ... To leave out all that is ugly, to eliminate the unnecessary, and to give Florida and the nation a resort city as perfect as study and ideals can make it.

On the first day of selling lots, May 14, 1925, $2 million was sold, with a further $2 million within the first month. There was a traffic jam in front of his Miami office. Mizner ran buses to Boca from Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, and also used seaplanes to transport potential buyers to the site. According to a typically exaggerated sales brochure, he had offices in &quot;several cities in Florida&quot;, as well as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Savannah, Georgia. (The only sales offices were in Palm Beach, Miami, and his Administration Buildings in the future Boca Raton.)

By the end of October more than $25 million in lots had been sold (though in most cases not paid for). Seeing that the large hotel would take a long time to build, Mizner immediately began work on a 100-room smaller hotel, the Ritz-Carlton Cloister Inn (now a wing of the Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club). It was constructed during late 1925 and opened in early 1926, at a cost of $1,750,000.

==Mizner&#x27;s role in the land boom collapse of 1926==
Where Mizner was not strong was in planning. He built houses &quot;off the cuff&quot;, without plans. He also had no financial plan, and tried to handle finance off the cuff as well. But the facilities he had announced — three golf courses, a polo ground, a theater, a large church, and an airport, to start with – were going to require a lot of money to build. Mizner did not have it, and he did not have a plan for getting it, or as a writer put it, his &quot;extravagant imagination outstripped his budget and the market.&quot; He lacked &quot;financial sense and business shrewdness.&quot; What he had were a lot of high society contacts, fame, and a track record building houses for the wealthy in Palm Beach.

When he set up Mizner Development Corporation in 1925, he was able to assemble a fantastic board of famous people and investors. This was a prime reason why initial sales were spectacular. Marie Dressler, recruited as a salesperson, described selling Boca Raton lots as &quot;a creative endeavor&quot; and the activity there as theater (&quot;uprooting large palm trees and planting them around houses ... to lend a touch of tropic romance to a scene&quot;).

A 1925 advertisement reassures purchasers (&quot;doubters&quot;) that Florida property is &quot;gold&quot;, and that they are getting a bargain, buying early. Another, that &quot;an investment in Boca Raton soil is an anticipation of potential profit,&quot; and &quot;every promise of the Mizner Development Corporation is meant to be kept.&quot; His advertisements said to attach the ad to the sales contract, as a part of it, and noted &quot;the names&quot; who were &quot;guaranteeing&quot; the project. Using the names to make sales was the idea of publicity agent Harry Reichenbach. But the cash flow was not even close to sufficient to build his promised facilities. Some of the directors, whose attorneys warned them of potential liability, since their names were being used in advertisements, resigned. DuPont unsuccessfully requested the resignations of Reichenbach and corporation treasurer Wilson Mizner, who taught salesmen to mention the famous names. He resigned as chairman of the board on October 24, 1925, &quot;a nasty split.&quot; A statement from du Pont&#x27;s resignation was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Three other directors and a member of the Finance Committee resigned within days, making a public statement that the Corporation should not be using their names since they had little control over the company, which did not have &quot;reasonable and competent management.&quot; The Ritz-Carlton Cloister Inn opened on February 6, 1926, and Mizner had an elegant dinner for 500 guests, after rush ordering 906 dozen plates, cups, and other items. Over the winter season an additional $6 million trickled in, but sales came to a halt in the spring, and previous purchasers were not all making payments. By May 1926 unpaid contractors were beginning legal action against the company, forcing it into receivership. This led to Mizner&#x27;s losing control of the corporation in July 1926 and to bankruptcy in September. This was the beginning of the end of Mizner&#x27;s career as an architect.

A statement during the bankruptcy proceedings outlined what the Mizner Development Corporation had accomplished as of December 4, 1926, besides building the Administration Buildings and the Cloister Inn:

==Bankruptcy ==
The bankruptcy was resolved a year later in November 1927, when Clarence Geist bought the Company&#x27;s assets. As well as the Cloister Inn, the corporation had built two Administration Buildings, a radio station, WFLA, and twenty-nine homes. Geist, a utilities executive, saw to it that Boca got a fine water plant; Mizner was unconcerned about such infrastructure.

Many people lost money through their investments in Boca Raton lots through Mizner; people who had purchased lots with the intention of quickly reselling them, very common during the land boom, found them worthless. After bankruptcy proceedings, creditors received 0.1% on the dollar; for example, the Andrews Asphalt and Paving Company received $93.36 of its $93,362 claim, and Riddle Engineering Company received $30.76 of its bill of $30,764. The Palm Beach Savings Bank, which had lent Mizner Development over 70% of its capital (the stockholders of Mizner were also officers of the bank), closed permanently in June 1926, because of the Mizner bankruptcy. After the bankruptcy, when credit typically improves, Mizner borrowed:
* $99,636 from the Farmers Bank and Trust Company
* $47,500 from the Commercial Bank and Trust Company
* $101,689 from the First American Bank and Trust
* $57,982 from the Palm Beach Bank and Trust Company
* $99,500 from the Chelsea Exchange Bank
Nothing was ever repaid of the last three loans. Mizner himself was hurt financially. He was not noted for his business acumen, and a recent biographer qualifies him as &quot;naïve&quot; and &quot;in denial&quot;, but with no intention to defraud. No one has ever described Mizner as greedy or motivated by prospects of financial gain. Members of his board, it was learned after banking records were unsealed more than sixty years later, were engaged in criminal embezzlement through their partnership in the Palm Beach Savings Bank. Mizner apparently knew nothing of this and would likely have been horrified if he had learned of it.

Mizner Industries was declared bankrupt four months after Mizner&#x27;s death in 1933. The company had stopped paying federal tax and county property tax after 1928. The company emerged from the bankruptcy reorganization and continued operations.

==Late career==
In 1927 Mizner built a house for John R. Bradley called Casa Serena in Colorado Springs. Several of Mizner&#x27;s friends got together in 1928 to publish a folio monograph of his work. It was entitled &quot;Florida Architecture of Addison Mizner&quot; and featured 185 photographs of homes by Frank Geisler. Paris Singer contributed an introduction and Ida M. Tarbell wrote the text. There was also an &quot;Edición Imperial&quot;, limited to 100 copies, a leather-bound, gold-tooled version with slipcase cover. This brought Mizner several commissions but they came to a stop with the beginning of the world depression. &quot;With neither prospects nor money, [he] was sadly forced to rely on financial support from friends [such as] Irving Berlin and Edward Moore.&quot;
The one exception was the extensive Dieterich estate, &#x27;Casa Bienvenida&#x27; (Welcome House), on Park Lane in Montecito near Santa Barbara, California. He designed and directed its creation from 1929 to 1930. The significant new Mediterranean Revival estate&#x27;s budget was unhindered by the Wall Street crash of 1929. The naturalistic landscape and formal gardens were designed by atmospheric painter and landscape designer Lockwood de Forest Jr. (1850–1932). His water channels are replicas of those at Villa Lante at Bagnaia, near Viterbo in the Italian Tuscany region. Mizner integrated the principal indoor and outdoor rooms by a cloistered arcade with slender columns on three sides of a large courtyard. He linked that to the inclined axis with a pavilion in the form of a Palladian arch on a terraced stone pedestal at the vista terminus. Casa Bienvenida is extant and well maintained to the present day.
The Spanish revival style here draws its forms and elements from medieval sources. Mizner used many high art details not generally found in this area ... while maintaining the Santa Barbara characteristic of pure design.

==Legacy==

Mizner&#x27;s buildings were typically dismissed by Modernist critics for their eclectic historicist aesthetic. Many were demolished and redeveloped, but a number of those that survive are now on the National Register.

Architects and contractors alike copied Mizner&#x27;s iteration of Spanish colonial architecture.

In the Boca Raton area, his names, Addison and Mizner, are frequently found on streets, businesses, and developments. On the grounds of the Boca Raton Resort and Club is Mizner Lake Estates, an intimate 15-estate gated enclave of million dollar homes with 24-hour security. In Delray Beach can be found Addison Reserve Country Club, a golf and tennis community of 717 luxury single-family homes situated on . It consists of nineteen villages with names such as &quot;Mirasol&quot; and &quot;Playa Riente&quot;. Also in Boca Raton is Mizner Park, an upscale &quot;lifestyle center&quot; with shops, rental apartments, and offices. In March 2005, to commemorate his visionary contributions to both the city and Florida architecture, an statue of the architect by Colombian sculptor Cristobal Gaviria was erected in Boca Raton at Mizner Boulevard and U.S. 1. In addition, Addison Mizner Elementary School in Boca Raton was named for him in 1968.

He was the brother and sometimes partner of businessman, raconteur, con man, professional gambler, and playwright Wilson Mizner, whom Addison termed &quot;my chief weakness and dreaded menace&quot;. The brothers&#x27; series of picaresque misadventures were the inspiration for Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Road Show&quot; (2008) (also titled &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;Gold!&quot;), which was also produced in Chicago and London. Previously, in 1952, Addison&#x27;s friend Irving Berlin wrote a musical called &quot;Wise Guy&quot; (also named &quot;Palm Beach, Sentimental Guy&quot;, and &quot;The Mizner Story&quot;), which never got produced. It featured Addison, Wilson, his friends, and his clients. According to the Introduction by Isaiah Sheffer, three songs from that work were included in the 1996 sheet music album &quot;The Unsung Irving Berlin&quot;. 

In 1951 Theodore Pratt wrote a novel, &quot;The Big Bubble&quot;, which is a thinly veiled biography of Mizner. In 2014 Richard René Silvin published his book &quot;Villa Mizner: The House that Changed Palm Beach&quot;, chronicling the life of Addison Mizner though a story about Mizner&#x27;s own home on Worth Avenue and Via Mizner, Palm Beach: Villa Mizner.

Mizner&#x27;s Lounge was the name of the tavern at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa from the hotel&#x27;s opening in 1988 until 2019. Mizner&#x27;s Lounge closed on April 12, 2019, to be replaced by a Beauty and the Beast-themed bar and lounge.

==Award==
The Addison Mizner Award was created in 2013 by the &quot;Florida Chapter&quot; of the Institute of Classical Architecture &amp; Art for Excellence in Classical and Traditional Architecture. During the early period of Florida&#x27;s urban development, the standards of excellence in composition and craftsmanship were defined by Mizner&#x27;s civic and domestic works in classical and traditional design. The awards are presented yearly in the multiple categories.

<text>Mizner Park is a high-end shopping, residential, and entertainment district located in the affluent downtown neighborhood of Boca Raton, Florida. The district consists of a collection of high-end shops and restaurants with luxury apartments built in a Mediterranean Revival architectural style. The mall opened in 1991 on the site of the former Boca Mall, which opened in 1974.

The Centre for the Arts at Mizner Park is located on the north end of the development, which includes an amphitheatre and the Boca Raton Museum of Art.

Cooper Carry designed Mizner as a classical Mediterranean Revival town center. It is named for architect Addison Mizner, founder of Boca Raton.

==History==
The site of Mizner Park was previously a conventional enclosed shopping center called Boca Mall, which opened in 1974. Boca Mall was originally anchored by Britt&#x27;s and Jefferson Ward. The former closed in 1982 and was temporarily occupied by IBM offices until 1985, when it was converted to Levitz Furniture. In 1989, Levitz relocated and Jefferson Ward closed. The colloquial term &quot;dive bar&quot; may have entered widespread use as a result of a bar located in the mall in its final days. The closure of these anchors led to the mall&#x27;s demolition and redevelopment.

Mizner Park opened in 1991, expanding in 1996 with a Jacobson&#x27;s department store. Jacobson&#x27;s closed in July 2002 after the chain declared bankruptcy, and its location became Robb &amp; Stucky Interiors in 2003. After Robb &amp; Stucky also declared bankruptcy, its store was closed as well. The building was converted to Lord &amp; Taylor in 2013.

It was home to the National Cartoon Museum from 1992 to 2002.

In 2017, Ouzo Bay opened at Mizner Park.

==Amphitheater==
The Mizner Park Amphitheater (originally known as the Count de Hoernle Amphitheater) is an outdoor amphitheater located in Boca Raton, Florida. It can be found in the northeast corner of Mizner Park, an outdoor shopping center in Pearl City. It was named after the Count and Countess de Hoernle.

The mid-sized venue cost $6.2 million to construct. It consists of a stage surrounded by a colonnade with a statue and fountain at the entrance of the lawn area. The venue seats 3,520, which can be expanded to 4,200 in a general admission setting.

The venue opened in November 2002 with an inauguration ceremony by Henrietta Rach de Hoernle, followed a concert by Florida Symphony Orchestra. The city took ownership of the amphitheatre in September 2010, changing the venue&#x27;s name as well.

It is the summer home to the Boca Raton Symphonia.

<text>The National Nordic Museum (previously Nordic Heritage Museum and then Nordic Museum) is a museum in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States, dedicated to the Nordic history, art, culture, and the heritage of the area&#x27;s Nordic immigrants. It was founded in 1980 as the Nordic Heritage Museum, moved into a permanent, purpose-built facility in 2018 named the Nordic Museum, and was designated as the National Nordic Museum in 2019. The museum serves as a community gathering place and shares Nordic culture by exhibiting art and objects, preserving collections, and providing educational and cultural experiences from Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish Americans. The geographical region covered by the Museum includes the entire Nordic region (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, the regions of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Åland, and the cultural region of Sápmi).

==Description==
The museum was originally known as the &#x27;Nordic Heritage Museum&#x27; and was located in a red brick building in a predominantly residential part of Ballard. This building had housed the Daniel Webster Elementary School from 1907 to 1979, at which time low student enrollment led to its closure. In 2018, the museum was renamed the &#x27;Nordic Museum&#x27; and moved into a new building on NW Market Street in Ballard. This building, commissioned by the Museum, opened May 5, 2018, and was dedicated by Icelandic president Guðni Th. Jóhannesson and Danish crown princess Mary.

The non-profit museum&#x27;s mission is to share &quot;Nordic culture with people of all ages and backgrounds by exhibiting art and objects, preserving collections, providing educational and cultural experiences, and serving as a community gathering place.&quot; The founder and long-time director Marianne Forssblad retired in 2007. Eric Nelson followed her as executive director and Janet Rauscher became chief curator in 2008. In 2012, Lizette Gradén became the chief curator. In September 2019, Leslie Anne Anderson became director of collections, exhibitions, and programs. She oversees the curatorial department.

The museum published the &quot;NHM Historical Journal&quot; on a quarterly basis until 2011. In 2013 the museum published its first edition of the annual magazine &quot;Nordic Kultur&quot;.

The museum has also published books including &quot;Voices of Ballard and Beyond: Stories of Immigrants and Their Descendants in the Pacific Northwest&quot; published in 2012.

The Nordic Museum contains a Cultural Resource Center, that includes the Walter Johnson Memorial Library which was founded in 1980. As of 2011 it held 15500 books. It specializes in books published in Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish. Its special collection includes the Gordon Tracie Music Collection and the Vanishing Generations Oral History Project. The Gordon Ekvall Tracie Music Collection (formerly the Gordon Ekvall Tracie Music Library) was founded in 1995. As of 2011 it contained 3000 audio/visual materials, 4000 music scores, 2500 books, and 40 periodical subscriptions. It focuses on folk customs, traditional dance, traditional music, folk art, and folk attire for Nordic cultures. Its special collections include the Gordon Ekvall Tracie Music Collection, the Nordiska Folkdancers Collection, and the Skandia Folkdance Society Collection.

The museum was designated as the National Nordic Museum in March 2019 by the U.S. Congress as part of the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. The new name was dedicated by senators Maria Cantwell and Lisa Murkowski the following month.

==Exhibitions==
===Nordic Heritage Museum===

As part of the long term exhibits, the old Nordic Heritage Museum had five ethnic galleries, one for each country, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, as well a gallery, &quot;Dream of America&quot;, describing Nordic emigration to the Pacific Northwest. There was also a temporary gallery space.

*Dream of America
*Folk Art Galleries
*Fishing Gallery
*Logging Gallery
*Iceland Room
*Norway Room
*Denmark Room
*Finland Room
*Sweden Room

===National Nordic Museum===

The permanent exhibit has been reconceived as a single exhibit, &quot;Nordic Journeys&quot;, spread over five galleries. Besides artifacts from the museum&#x27;s permanent collection, over 100 objects are on extended loan from other museums in the U.S. and national museums of the five Nordic countries. The exhibit ranges from 4,000-year-old stone axes and Viking-era artifacts to examples of modern Nordic design.

==Public programs==
A large part of the museum&#x27;s focus is offering programming to educate the public about Scandinavian culture, including a craft school, adult and kids programs and teacher resources.

* Films
* Lectures
* Exhibition openings and artist tours

==Special events==
Each year the National Nordic Museum hosts two major community events, Nordic Sól and Julefest.

Nordic Sól began in 1984 as Tivoli Days and was held each July. In 2008 the two-day event&#x27;s name was changed to Viking Days and in 2011 the event moved to mid-August. In 2018, the event moved back to July to coincide with the annual Ballard SeafoodFest. The event features food and craft vendors, Scandinavian music, and a Viking Encampment. In 2019, the museum renamed Viking Days to Nordic Sól and redesigned it to highlight more aspects of Nordic history and contemporary culture.

Julefest is held the Saturday and Sunday before Thanksgiving each year. This event is a Nordic Christmas celebration with craft vendors, Nordic food and music, and Christmas traditions on display. The 2019 Julefest was the 42nd occurrence of this festival.

<text>Susan Molinari (born March 27, 1958) is an American politician, company executive, journalist, and lobbyist from New York. A member of the Republican Party, she sat in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1990 to 1997, representing Staten Island for three terms. Molinari, who was considered a rising star in the party, was selected to deliver the keynote address at the 1996 Republican National Convention. However, the next year, she resigned from Congress to become a television journalist for CBS News. Later, she became a vice president for public policy at Google from 2012 to 2018.

==Early life, education and early political career==

Molinari was born in Staten Island, New York, the daughter of Marguerite (Wing) and lawyer and perennial Republican politician Guy Molinari. She is the granddaughter of Italian-born Republican politician S. Robert Molinari.

She graduated from the then SUNY Albany (now called the University at Albany, The State University of New York). She served on the New York City Council before winning a special election to the House of Representatives in 1990 as a Republican to replace her father, who retired from Congress to become Staten Island Borough President.

Molinari is a member of the Advisory Board for WeProtect which is a global non-profit cooperation with the goal to protect children online and stop the crime of online child sexual abuse and exploitation.
==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1990
On January 1, 1990, her father, incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Guy Molinari, decided to resign in order to become Borough President of Staten Island. She ran for her father&#x27;s seat in Staten Island-based 14th congressional district. On the eve of the special election, &quot;The New York Times&quot; endorsed Molinari because she &quot;promises to add a moderate Republican voice to the city&#x27;s Democratic-dominated congressional delegation&quot;. In March 1990, she defeated Robert Gigante 59% to 35%.

;1992
After redistricting, she ran in New York&#x27;s 13th congressional district. She won the Republican primary with 75%. In the general election, she defeated NYC Councilmember Sal Albanese 56%–38% and was elected to her first full term.

;1994
She won re-election to her second full term with 71% of the vote.

;1996
She won re-election to her third full term with 62% of the vote. She resigned effective August 2, 1997.

===Tenure===
While in the House of Representatives, Molinari was among the more moderate and liberal members of the Republican Party.

She signed on to the Republicans&#x27; 1994 Contract with America, which promised a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and opposed the placing of U.S. troops under UN command. Concerning social policy, she leaned more liberal than many of her Republican colleagues. Molinari supported abortion rights, but stated on CNN in January 2012 that, after having children, she is now anti-abortion. She also sided with the Democrats in voting for the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), a cornerstone of Bill Clinton&#x27;s social policy. She offset these positions with her own standing as a new mother, framing her outlook in terms of &quot;family values&quot;, and in fact energetically campaigned for fellow Republicans with whom she disagreed on both abortion and FMLA. She favored reduction of Social Security taxes, middle class tax cuts, and tax credits for families. Molinari worked with Christopher O. Ward to acquire the Staten Island Railroad to re-establish freight service to the Howland Hook Marine Terminal.

On issues of crime and punishment, she favored extended use of the federal death penalty and other restrictions. Molinari is also remembered for her role as principal sponsor of Federal Rules of Evidence 413-15. As Molinari put it on the House floor in 1994, the rules &quot;strengthen the legal system&#x27;s tools for bringing the perpetrators of these atrocious crimes to justice.&quot;

In her autobiography she intimated that the tense ideological atmosphere within the Republican Party after they won majority in the House and Georgian Newt Gingrich became Speaker contributed to her unease. Molinari gave the keynote speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention, but resigned from the House in June 1997 to take a job as a television journalist for CBS.

===Committee assignments===
When first elected, she received assignments on the Small Business Committee and Public Works committees. In the 102nd Congress (1991–1993), she traded those assignments to take a seat on the Education and Labor Committee. When the Republicans took control of the House in the 104th Congress (1995–1997), Molinari traded in her Education/Labor seat for a place on the House Budget Committee.

She was vice chairwoman of the Republican Conference and Republican Policy Committee.

==Post-congressional career==

===Journalism===
At CBS, Molinari was co-host of news program &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; for about nine months until 1998. Her hiring was controversial from the very beginning; Although Molinari had earned degrees in communication, her major professional credentials were political, and her main national public recognition came from her speech at the Republican National Convention. Media critics asked whether a partisan politician could reasonably be expected to maintain objectivity. Others at the time criticized her on-air demeanor as either too &quot;stiff&quot; or too &quot;perky&quot;, or attacked her interviews as superficial. Conservatives accused her of &quot;selling out&quot;. Although allegedly CBS had first tried to respond to these criticisms by switching Molinari into &quot;home and garden&quot; journalism, the official comment from CBS executives was that they thought her better suited to political commentary, and had no such position available.

Molinari announced she was pregnant at the end of her nine-month run at CBS. Her second child was born in late January 1999.

Molinari later hosted a public affairs show called &quot;The Flipside&quot; and has been a frequent guest commentator on major political talk shows.

===Lobbying and consulting===
After a stint as a lobbyist on her own, Molinari joined the Washington Group in October 2001, becoming the lobbying firm&#x27;s president and chief executive.

Molinari joined the law and public policy firm Bracewell &amp; Giuliani in 2008 as a senior principal. The firm is home to former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and has a well-established government relations and strategic communications practice. Previously, she was president of Ketchum Public Affairs and also served as chief executive officer of Ketchum Inc.&#x27;s lobbying firm, The Washington Group, where she served as its chairman. In 2006 Molinari&#x27;s firm received $300,062 from home mortgage giant Freddie Mac to lobby on their behalf.

Molinari supports the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN), which operates a telephone hotline in conjunction with more than 1,000 rape crisis centers nationwide. The group also sponsors outreach programs on college campuses. Her activities have included sponsoring legislation, and more recently heading a task force directed toward developing an Internet-based counterpart to the existing hotline.

Molinari also serves as Chair of The Century Council, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to fighting drunk driving and underage drinking by advocating and facilitating education, communications, research, law enforcement, and other programs. In its fight against these types of alcohol abuse, the Council is funded by &quot;America&#x27;s leading distillers&quot; of alcoholic liquor, including Bacardi, Inc. and several other liquor manufacturers.

===Political activities===
Although she has maintained a public face, Molinari&#x27;s subsequent political activities have been largely behind the scenes. She supported George W. Bush&#x27;s election in 2000, but joined with more moderate members of her party such as Gerald Ford, David Rockefeller, and Richard Riordan in forming the Republican Unity Coalition, which opposed Bush&#x27;s decision to support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution banning gay marriage.

Molinari did not seek elected office in 2006, bucking speculation that she would run against Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton. She served as an adviser to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s (R) 2008 presidential campaign. There was early speculation she might consider running for mayor of New York City in 2009, but she never did. In January 2010, Molinari confirmed that she was seriously considering a Senate bid against U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, before issuing a public statement three days later saying that she had decided not to run.

In 2013 Molinari was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

In 2020, it was announced that she would speak at the 2020 Democratic National Convention in support of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, becoming one of two one-time U.S. political party convention keynote speakers, along with Zell Miller, to speak at a convention for the opposite party.

Molinari is also a member of the Atlantic Council&#x27;s Board of Directors.

==Personal life==
Molinari married fellow U.S. Representative Bill Paxon on July 3, 1994, after having previously been married to John Lucchesi. She and Paxon have two daughters, and reside in Alexandria, Virginia .

<text>RNZ National (), formerly Radio New Zealand National, and known until 2007 as the National Programme or National Radio, is a publicly funded non-commercial New Zealand English-language radio network operated by Radio New Zealand. It specialises in programmes dedicated to news, the arts, music, and New Zealand culture generally, and includes some material in the Māori language. Historically the programme was broadcast on the (AM) &quot;YA&quot; stations 1YA, 2YA, 3YA and 4YA in the main centres.

In 2013, RNZ National had a 10.3 per cent market share, the highest nationwide and up from 9.1 per cent in 2009. Market share peaked at 11.1 per cent in 2011, probably due to the station&#x27;s coverage of the Christchurch earthquake. In 2014 493,000 people listened to RNZ National over the course of a week – the second-largest cumulative audience. A 2021 survey estimated 609,800 listeners (13.5% of the 10+ population), Morning Report being the most popular, with 434,000 listeners.

Its sister station is RNZ Concert.

<doc id="953960" wikidata="Q885839" url="?curid=953960" title="William Pope Duval">
<text>William Pope Duval (September 4, 1784 – March 19, 1854) was the first civilian governor of the Florida Territory, succeeding Andrew Jackson, who had been a military governor. In his twelve-year governorship, from 1822 to 1834, he divided Florida into four territories, established the local court system, and chose Tallahassee as the territory&#x27;s capital because of its central location. Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, Duval Street in Key West, and Duval Street in Tallahassee are named for him.

==Early life==
William Duval was born to Major William Duval and Ann Pope in &quot;Mansfield,&quot; Henrico County, Virginia (near present-day Richmond). At the age of 14, he left home and struck out on his own, settling in Bardstown, Kentucky. He began to study law and was admitted to the bar at age 19, in 1804. On October 3, 1804 (then 20), he married Nancy Hynes, daughter of Colonel Andrew Hynes, in Bardstown.

==Congressional service==
During an outbreak of Indian hostilities in 1812, Duval was given command of a company of mounted volunteers. This service and his law experience helped to win him election to the 13th Congress of the United States in 1812. He served as a representative from the Democratic-Republican Party in the new 10th Congressional District of Kentucky until 1815, when he did not seek re-election. He returned to Kentucky and continued to practice law.

==Territory of Florida==
In 1821, Florida became a U.S. territory. Duval was named U.S. Judge for the East Florida district on May 18, 1821. On April 17, 1822, President James Monroe appointed him as the first non-military governor of the territory, succeeding Gen. Andrew Jackson. In addition, Most Worshipful William Pope Duval was elected the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Florida, Free and Accepted Masons in 1830.

He was reappointed by presidents John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. During his twelve-year administration, he selected the small Indian village of Tallahassee as the site for the territory&#x27;s capital, on account of its (north) central location. He was also known for his peaceful dealings with the Native Americans. He signed the first act of legislation in the Territory of Florida, dividing it into four sections and establishing the local court system.

==Post-governorship==
Duval continued to live in Florida for a number of years, practicing law. His former mansion burned in 1905, and the site now houses the Carnegie Library at FAMU. He moved to Texas in 1848. He and his wife had eight children, many of whom began families in Texas.

All three of his sons were distinguished Texans: Burr Harrison Duval, Thomas Howard DuVal, and John Crittenden Duval. Thomas&#x27; daughter, Florence Duval West, was a poet.

William Pope Duval died in Washington, D.C.; his remains were interred at the Congressional Cemetery.

==Legacy==
*Duval County, Florida, was named for him.
*Duval County, Texas, was named for his son, Captain Burr H. Duval.
*The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

There are many roads in Florida named after him, the most well-known being Duval Street in Key West, Florida.

Washington Irving&#x27;s character &quot;Ralph Ringwood” and James K. Paulding&#x27;s character &quot;Nimrod Wildfire&quot; were based on Duval.

<text>RNZ Concert () is a publicly funded non-commercial New Zealand FM fine music radio network. Radio New Zealand owns the network and operates it from its Wellington headquarters. The network&#x27;s playlist of classical, jazz, contemporary, and world music includes recordings by local musicians and composers. Around 15 percent of its airtime features live concerts, orchestral performances, operas, interviews, features, and specialty music programs, many of them recorded locally.

The network&#x27;s specialist production department commissions work, initiates music programs, and records live broadcasts of concerts and recitals from local and visiting international musicians. RNZ Concert received the Arts Foundation of New Zealand Governor&#x27;s Award. RNZ Concert draws content from its international counterparts, including Australia&#x27;s ABC Classic, the European Broadcasting Union, Chicago&#x27;s WFMT Radio Network, and BBC Radio 3.

==History==

===Early history===

Classical music broadcasting began in New Zealand with the opening of 2YC in Wellington on 24 February 1933, with further YC stations starting in Auckland, Christchurch and Dunedin in the following couple of years (see Call signs in New Zealand). In 1936, these four stations as well as the YA and ZB stations (forerunners to RNZ National and Newstalk ZB) were organised under the auspices of the New Zealand Broadcasting Service.

Stations were modelled after the BBC&#x27;s Third Programme, and routinely broadcast local musicians in studio. The National Orchestra (now the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra) was founded within the NZBS and its very first concert from the Wellington Town Hall in February 1947 was broadcast live on 2YC. The four YC stations and other regional stations in the same format eventually began taking networked programming from Wellington under the banner of &quot;The YC Network&quot;, and these stations in 1975 unified nationwide to form the &quot;Concert Programme&quot; under a reorganised Radio New Zealand.

=== Breakup of RNZ ===
The growth of private commercial radio and Radio New Zealand&#x27;s commercial assets by the fourth National government in the 1990s changed the environment in which the Concert Programme operated. Radio New Zealand&#x27;s commercial stations were sold to The Radio Network (later known as NZME), and RNZ became a Crown entity, continuing to operate National Radio (now RNZ National) and a renamed &quot;Concert FM&quot;. Concert lost many of its music studios including Broadcasting House in Wellington, much prized by orchestras and classical musicians for recording, Until the launch of the AM Network in 1997, the network carried live coverage of the proceedings of the New Zealand Parliament.

===Recent history===

Since 2000, the network has aired a New Year&#x27;s Day countdown from an annual survey of New Zealand&#x27;s 65 most popular fine music tracks. First-placed pieces have included Handel&#x27;s Messiah and Schumann&#x27;s Konzertstuck first movement, and a majority of high-ranking pieces have come from English composers. The highest-ranked pieces are performed live by the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra during the previous November, at concerts hosted by well-known New Zealanders like John Campbell and Wallace Chapman. A print advertising campaign showing the musical scores of popular tracks depicted as battle scenes has been used to promote the countdown since 2012.

On 22 January 2007 Concert FM was renamed Radio New Zealand Concert to associate it more clearly with the Radio New Zealand brand, which was subsequently shortened to RNZ Concert in 2016. As part of its promotion of New Zealand Music Month, the network has produced a series of podcasts of New Zealand performances of classic works. NZ On Air contributes $130,000 each year towards local recordings made by RNZ Concert through SOUNZ - Centre for New Zealand Music&#x27;s Resound Project.

===War commemorations===
RNZ Concert has been involved in several contests and performances commemorating Anzac Day and the centenary of World War I. In 2014, it broadcast a concert featuring the five finalists of a one-off secondary school song-writing competition - &#x27;The Calling&#x27; - in which students had to reflect the emotional impact the declaration of World War I had on New Zealand families through an original musical score.

In the same year it ran a joint competition with ABC Classic FM and the Australian Department for Veterans&#x27; Affairs - Gallipoli Songs - for original compositions that best reflected the experiences of the original ANZAC troops and their families. Australian soprano Merlyn Quaife, Australian composer Elliott Gyger, ABC host Stephen Adams, RNZ host Kate Mead and New Zealand composer Dame Gillian Whitehead judged the competition - and New Zealand composer Andrew Baldwin was one of the six winners. The compositions were performed, recorded and broadcast on RNZ Concert and ABC Classic FM on Anzac Day 2015.

===Funding and proposed changes to service===

RNZ is fully funded by the government through New Zealand on Air, but its funding has been nominally frozen since the election of the fifth National government in 2008. During his time as broadcasting minister in 2008 to 2011, National MP Jonathan Coleman asked the organisation to consider alternative revenue sources, including listener donations and commercial sponsorship of RNZ Concert programmes, to help cover the network&#x27;s operating costs. Commercial sponsorship has been criticised by opposition MPs and activism group Save RNZ, was rejected by former chief executive Peter Cavanagh, and continues to be resisted by current chief executive Paul Thompson.

The Concert programme has drawn criticism for its Government funding. It has faced allegations of elitism, left-wing bias, and serving wealthy audiences and minority interests. Equally, it has been accused of closely following commercial radio formats and failing to perform as a public broadcaster without commercial constraints. Supporters of the network have said it performs well on a small budget. In response, David Farrar has called for the station to be scrapped, saying it &quot;plays basically German classical music&quot; when &quot;almost every piece of classical music in history is available for free and can be streamed, made into playlists and the like&quot;.

On 5 February 2020, RNZ announced plans to lay off most of RNZ Concert&#x27;s staff, including all presenters. The plan would shift broadcasts from its FM frequencies to the AM Network and make the station presenterless, more akin to a music streaming service than a traditional radio station. This was to free up resources and FM frequencies for a new youth-focused network. Opponents of the plan, including Dame Kiri te Kanawa and Helen Clark, call the cuts &quot;very concerning&quot; and question whether youth would even tune in the proposed new radio service. The proposed changes were eventually dropped.

==Live performances==

===New Zealand Symphony Orchestra===
Recorded performances of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra have been one of the cornerstones of the programming since the orchestra was first formed. The orchestra began as a department of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, which later became Radio New Zealand, in 1946.

Despite the formal separation, Symphony Orchestra performances continue to be recorded, broadcast and archived by RNZ Concert. Auckland Town Hall, Wellington Town Hall and Michael Fowler Centre performances are broadcast live-to-air and streamed online, and performances in other centres or overseas cities are usually recorded and broadcast at a later date. On many occasions the pieces are from prominent composers, like Gustav Mahler, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Ludwig van Beethoven, Sergei Prokofiev or Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. On other occasions, they are the work of local composers like Gareth Farr, John Psathas, Eve de Castro-Robinson, or Chris Watson.

===Young composers===

Each year, young composers studying musical composition at university are also given the opportunity to have their work performed by the Symphony Orchestra and broadcast on RNZ Concert. The NZSO Todd Corporation Young Composers Award provides nine finalists with firsthand mentoring on orchestral composition and the chance to have their composition workshopped, rehearsed and performed by the full-size, professional orchestra. Each finalist is interviewed for a radio feature programme, with a judging panel deciding the award winner.

University of Otago student Sam van Betew won the competition in 2014, and said it was an honour to have &quot;one of the world&#x27;s best orchestras&quot; performing his music. University of Auckland and New Zealand School of Music graduate Robin Toan was a finalist in 2008, and described it as one of the most valuable experiences a young composer can have.

In 2005, Robin Toan was also the first young composer to be selected as composer-in-residence for the National Youth Orchestra. The NYO and the NZSO Chamber Orchestra are two NZSO subsidiaries whose performances have been recorded for RNZ Concert and its forerunner stations.

===Other groups===

RNZ Concert regularly takes live broadcasts of Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra and Chamber Music New Zealand concerts, and records other ensembles widely across the country. New Zealand String Quartet concerts have featured on RNZ Concert, as well as being broadcast by Deutsche Welle, CBC Radio 2 and ABC Classic FM.

Performances by church and private school choirs are often featured, including those of Wellington&#x27;s Cathedral of St Paul and Christchurch&#x27;s St Andrews School. Auckland&#x27;s Musica Sacra chamber choir has had several concerts recorded since 1998, and Wellington&#x27;s Nota Bene chamber choir has had its concerts regularly recorded since 2004. Winners of the Royal Overseas League Arts International Scholarship for a New Zealand Chamber Ensemble also have their performances recorded for broadcast.

==Recorded music==

===Local artists===
Over several decades RNZ Concert has recorded and broadcast many New Zealand compositions, and featured many local musicians. Its collected recordings, currently held by Ngā Taonga Sound and Vision national archives, have become a record of New Zealand&#x27;s fine music history. Some of the only remaining audio recordings of composer Douglas Lilburn are two radio interviews and a recorded performance of him playing his own piece &quot;From the Port Hills&quot;.

Many New Zealand musicians and composers, like London-based Kiri te Kanawa and Florida State University&#x27;s Reed Gainsford, have had their work recorded and broadcast by RNZ Concert while pursuing further musical study and career opportunities abroad in the United States, United Kingdom or Europe. Other artists have remained based in New Zealand, while having their work showcased by RNZ Concert and by fine music stations overseas. These include pianist and chamber soloist Katherine Austin, singer Judy Bellingham and organist Michael Stewart.

Composers and composing musicians such as Michael Williams, Phillip Brownlee, Yvette Audain, Nigel Keay and Ryan Youens have had their work featured on RNZ Concert, and several conductors including Martin Setchell have been involved in recordings. Singers Morag Atchison, Stephanie Acraman and Valerie Wycoff, violinists Amalia Hall and Natalie Sharonlin and pianists Charmaine Ford and Rachel Thomas have also performed their work.

===International artists===

International artists are regularly featured through the touring programmes of Chamber Music New Zealand, as well as soloists with the major orchestras. RNZ Concert also carries major coverage of the Michael Hill International Violin Competition every two years, both from Queenstown and Auckland.

==Broadcasting==

RNZ Concert uses the Radio Data System in its FM signal, broadcasts in stereo on FM, and is also available as web streaming, through the RNZ app, and on Freeview and Sky.

<doc id="953983" wikidata="Q3639996" url="?curid=953983" title="Bill Paxon">
<text>Leon William Paxon (born April 29, 1954) is an American lobbyist and former member of the United States House of Representatives from New York. From 1989 to 1999, he served five terms in Congress.

==Early life==

Paxon was born in Akron, New York, near Buffalo. At the age of 15, Paxon volunteered for the first congressional campaign of former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jack Kemp. Kemp, decades later, was the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996.

Paxon graduated from St. Joseph&#x27;s Collegiate Institute high school in 1972, and then from Canisius College. He was elected to the Erie County Legislature in November 1977 at the age of 23, making him the youngest member ever when elected. In addition, he holds honorary doctorates from Daemen College, Roberts Wesleyan College and Canisius College.

==Political career==
Paxon was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1988, sitting in the 185th, 186th and 187th New York State Legislatures.

=== Congress ===
He was elected to the 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th and 105th United States Congresses, holding office from January 3, 1989, to January 3, 1999. Paxon chaired the Republican House Leadership committee during the 105th Congress. In 1992, Paxon was elected to chair the National Republican Congressional Committee.

====Leadership challenge====
In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw Newt Gingrich&#x27;s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The challenge began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman John Boehner of Ohio and Republican leadership chairman Paxon. According to their plan, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats, along with dissenting Republicans, would vote in Dick Gephardt as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling he had not handled the situation correctly, as the only member of the leadership who had been appointed to his position, by Gingrich, instead of elected. Gingrich accepted Paxon&#x27;s resignation and directed Paxon to immediately vacate his leadership office space.

Paxon later considered, then rejected, a challenge to Armey&#x27;s post as majority leader. He instead decided that he would not run for re-election in 1998.

==Later career==
After leaving Congress, Paxon became an advisor to GOP congressional members.

Following his 21-year public service career, Paxon joined the law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP, where, since January 1999, he has advised a wide range of public and private sector clients on policy issues. He has consistently been rated one of Washington&#x27;s top lobbyists.

Paxon was hired by Boeing to lobby members of Congress.

==Personal life==
While in Congress, the conservative Paxon worked closely with moderate then Rep. Susan Molinari R-Staten Island, who is now a lobbyist. They married on July 3, 1994, and live in Alexandria, Virginia. They have two daughters.

<doc id="953991" wikidata="Q7719948" url="?curid=953991" title="The Breeze (New Zealand radio station)">
<text>The Breeze is a New Zealand radio station playing an adult contemporary music format owned by MediaWorks New Zealand. It airs in 25 markets across New Zealand and each market shows a mix of local and network programmes.

The station reached its highest ever audience of 671,000 listeners in 2021.

The Breeze launched a television channel called The Breeze TV in March 2020, which was acquired in December 2020 by Discovery, Inc. as part of its purchase of MediaWorks&#x27; television operations. Breeze TV became an online-only channel in March 2022. It ceased broadcasting in December 2022.

==History==

===Early years=== 
In 1993, owner Independent Broadcasting Company rebranded local stations 91FM (Auckland), Kiwi 898FM (Waikato), and Windy FM (Wellington) to The Breeze. The Auckland and Waikato stations previously played a hit music format and were changed to a hot adult contemporary format using the slogan &quot;Not Too Heavy, Not Too Soft.&quot; In Wellington, Windy FM had played classic rock before rebranding and changing to the easy listening format that would be used on future Breeze stations.

All three stations of The Breeze ran separately from each other, and each market had its own local shows.

===Change of ownership===
In 1995, The Breeze in Wellington was sold to the More FM Group, and in 1996, its parent company in Auckland and Waikato was sold to Prospect Limited.

At the end of 1996, Prospect Limited was sold to The Radio Network (TRN), and in 1997, TRN closed down The Breeze in Auckland and Waikato. It then used these frequencies to start 91ZM in Auckland, and 89.8ZM in Waikato.

The Breeze continued to broadcast in Wellington, and by 2000 the station was owned by Canwest, along with More FM and Channel Z, CanWest then purchased RadioWorks, and in 2001 The Breeze became part of RadioWorks collection of local once off stations known as LocalWorks. RadioWorks, later known as MediaWorks Radio.

===Expansion to other markets===
The Breeze made a return to Waikato in 2003 when local station Y 99.3 was rebranded as The Breeze, retaining Y99.3 local announcers but changing music format from adult contemporary to easy listening.

In 2004, MediaWorks decided to make their local station branding consistent in each market: In regions where MediaWorks operated one local radio station, it was rebranded as More FM, and if a second local station was operating in the region, that station became The Breeze.

===Networking===
In 2006 The Breeze launched in the Auckland market as a completely new station.

In April 2007, Dunedin and Palmerston North were the first two regions to replace some of its local programming, focusing on delivering a local breakfast show only. Creating a network allowed The Breeze to launch in other markets such as Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Bay of Plenty and, Southland.

In March 2009, a live networked breakfast show was introduced. The networked breakfast could be heard in regions where there was no local breakfast show - regions with a live breakfast show were not affected. In 2010 the networked breakfast was replaced with the Auckland breakfast show, presented by &quot;The Two Robbies&quot; (Robbie Rakete and Robert Scott).

In 2015, The Breeze added more local programming. In the Waikato, a local drive show was added. The More FM local breakfast announcers in Dunedin and Hawke&#x27;s Bay were moved to the local The Breeze stations in their respective markets.

In 2017, The Breeze Auckland moved away from a network product to become a fully local radio offering. All show day parts, including weekends and overnights, are now local to Auckland only; this is the only metro major brand offering this.

In 2018, The Breeze launched in Timaru, Oamaru, Ashburton, and the Mackenzie Country, with a local breakfast show broadcast to the regions.

===Format change===
Traditionally known as an easy listening radio station, The Breeze dropped this title in 2011. The Breeze in 2017 dropped 60&#x27;s from its playlist. Positioned as &quot;Your place to relax&quot;, with More Music, Less Talk.

===Television arm===

On 16 April 2020, The Breeze launched Breeze TV, a music TV channel on Freeview channel 14 and Sky channel 119. On 1 December 2020, international media company Discovery, Inc. acquired Breeze TV as part of its acquisition of MediaWorks&#x27; television arm. The Breeze TV closed down in December 2022.

==Stations==
===Network===
Networked programmes on The Breeze originate from the Auckland studios (except the daytime show and the network breakfast show, which originate from the Christchurch studios since March 2025). The first network breakfast shown was &quot;The Two Robbies&quot; as the show was originally presented by Robbie Rakete and Robert Scott. In 2015 Robert Scott moved to the Drive show and was initially replaced by Anna Thomas, before Jeanette Thomas joined the show in 2016.

In April 2016 the Wellington breakfast show presented by Steve Joll and Kath Bier became the network breakfast show presented from the Wellington studios until the end of 2018.

The format of The Breeze in Wellington was then rolled out to other stations in 2003 and 2004.

In late 2009 the station traded places on the FM dial with 99.2 More FM with the More FM station becoming Q92 99.4 More FM (the 99.4 MHz frequency is for Wanaka). At the same time the local breakfast show that was on The Breeze in Queenstown was moved to More FM with The Breeze in Queenstown now running networked shows at all times.

<text>The Second Leiter Building, also known as the Leiter II Building, the Sears Building, One Congress Center, and Robert Morris Center, is located at the northeast corner of South State Street and East Ida B. Wells Drive in Chicago, Illinois. The building is not to be confused with the present Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, constructed and owned by the famous nationwide mail-order firm Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. This landmark of the Chicago school of architecture gained fame for being one of the earliest commercial buildings constructed with a metal skeleton frame remaining in the United States.

Built in 1891 by Levi Z. Leiter, (1834–1904), the Second Leiter Building was designed by architect William Le Baron Jenney, who implemented the skeletal frame made of steel to make the design fireproof. The building was leased by Levi Leiter to the department store of Siegel, Cooper and Company who occupied it for approximately seven years. After Siegel Cooper closed, the building hosted various tenants until it became the downtown flagship store of Sears, Roebuck and Company in 1931. Sears occupied the space the until 1986 when it decided to close the store and the space was leased to other tenants.

The structure is eight floors and occupies the entire block of State Street between Ida B. Wells Drive and Van Buren Street. The State Street facade consists of nine bays separated by wide pilasters. The pilasters are capped by simple capitals and an unadorned cornice crowns the entire structure. The Ida B. Wells and Van Buren facades are three bays wide with measurements of by . Within each bay are four windows on each floor aligned vertically. The building is faced with a pink granite. Each floor contains with ceilings and could be divided to house multiple tenants.

Its predecessor, the First Leiter Building, was designed by Jenney in 1879 and stood at Wells and Monroe until it was demolished in 1972. The Second Leiter Building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and a Chicago Landmark on January 14, 1997. From 1998 to 2020, the building was home to the Chicago campus of Robert Morris University, which vacated the space following its merger with Roosevelt University on March 9, 2020.

<doc id="953998" wikidata="Q5331146" url="?curid=953998" title="Mix (radio station)">
<text>Mix was a greatest hits radio station in New Zealand, broadcasting music from the 70s, 80s and 90s. Mix was owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. Mix is targeted at 35 to 54-year-olds. Its head office and studios were located in central Auckland, alongside New Zealand Media and Entertainment&#x27;s seven other radio networks. In September 2020, Mix was replaced with Gold (see below).

Mix had just one presenter; Breffni O&#x27;Rourke presented a show based in Nelson. Melanie Homer and later Tracey Donaldson also presented a nationwide breakfast show based out of Auckland. Mix played a wide variety of music from superstar acts such as Madonna, Prince, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams, Bon Jovi, Crowded House, Queen, Talking Heads, Tom Petty and more.

==History==

=== Radio i ===
The history of Mix dates as far back as the 1960s when a company called &quot;Radio International&quot; started Radio i in Auckland. The station started originally leasing air time on 1ZM, as the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation had a monopoly on the New Zealand airwaves preventing private broadcasters from operating.

Radio i was granted a broadcasting licence in 1970, the same year Radio Hauraki was granted the very first private commercial licence in New Zealand. It originally broadcast on 1590AM in the Auckland region, but moved to 1330AM in 1978, and then to 1332AM on 23 November 1978 with the switch to 9 kHz spacing. When the station switched to FM in 1990 the name was changed to Radio i92FM broadcasting on 91.8FM. After 3 months on the air on 91.8FM the station moved to its current frequency on 98.2FM and became Radio i98FM. Peter Sinclair was among the station&#x27;s hosts.

===Easy Listening i===

Radio i became Easy Listening i in 1992 to reflect the station&#x27;s easy listening format. It won best station promotion at the 1992 New Zealand Radio Awards, for a &quot;jumbo challenge&quot; campaign that featured Mike Farmer, Bill Mudgeway, Warwick Rees, Kate Rigg and Alice Worsley. The following year, breakfast host Kerry Smith won Air Personality of the Year for the Easy Listening Wake-up. The station was also a finalist for metropolitan station of the year, giving recognition to other hosts like Bob Leahy, Geoff Rooke, Ed Taylor and John Taylor. In 1995, breakfast hosts Geoff Rooke and Andrea McLay were finalists for Air Personality of the Year.
Easy Listening underwent several changes of ownership in the 1990s. A Hamilton station, Easy Listening 97FM, was rebranded as Easy Listening i97FM in 1993 and adopted an identical format. In 1995, it began simulcasting the Auckland station&#x27;s programmes. In 1996 Easy Listening i was sold to The Radio Network, and Hamilton&#x27;s station went back to local programming. In 1999 Easy Listening was dropped from the Waikato market and Newstalk ZB took over the frequency.

The network won Best Music Feature and a special commendation at the 2004 New Zealand Radio Awards, for a tribute documentary to Bee Gees musician Maurice Gibb broadcast the morning after his death. Produced overnight by Tim Roxborogh, Andrew Turling and John Budge, the documentary was based on Roxborogh&#x27;s interview with Maurice Gibb and his previous interviews with band members. At the 2004 and 2005 awards Easy Mix was also recognised for promotional trailers, programming and promotion. Figures from the Radio Broadcasting Association also showed Easy Listening i broadcast more New Zealand music in 2004 than any other easy listening station, including The Breeze.

===Viva===
The Easy Listening network was rebranded as Viva FM in 2005. Viva was geared towards women, and the first New Zealand radio network to actively target women. Viva&#x27;s target listener a 30 to 54 year old professional who was confident, self-aware and a regular cafe visitor. The station was launched with a party at SkyCity Auckland featuring performer Greg Johnson and guests Keisha Castle-Hughes, Ali Mau, April Bruce and Danny Morrison.

The station combined easy listening music with inspirational talk to &quot;strengthen listeners&#x27; emotional connection to the station&quot; and expand the listener base. Dean Young and Raylene Ramsay hosted the Viva breakfast show, and Simon Dallow hosted the station&#x27;s talk and music morning show. The John Tesh Radio Show broadcast on weekday afternoons, Tim Roxborogh hosted the drive show, and singer-presenter Gael Ludlow presented the Lovesongs &#x27;til Midnight night show.

===Easy Mix===

Viva was rebranded Easy Mix in August 2007. Consumer research had shown the brand was confused with a paper towel product and a New Zealand Herald supplement with the same name, and rival station The Breeze had outrated Viva in its first year in the Auckland market. The Radio Network made the unusual step of relaunching the network just before a ratings survey, using promotional activity to &quot;soft launch&quot; the new brand. The network returned to broadcasting a separate Auckland and network programme from the same studio to allow hosts to discuss more local Auckland issues. However, it was also criticised for being one of several foreign-owned Auckland-based radio networks with no local content. Easy Mix began broadcasting its networked programme in Wellington on 93.5FM in 2008.

The national line-up for Easy Mix regularly changed. The breakfast featured combinations of Alf Rose, Raylene Ramsay, Tim Roxborogh and Alison Leonard until a reduction in on-air staff in 2010. Roxborogh was a travel writer for the New Zealand Herald, and Leonard was a judge on Dancing with the Stars New Zealand. Leonard hosted the show in 2010 and 2011, and Lorna Subritzky took over in 2012. Alison Leonard, Rebecca Swaney and Mel Homer served as daytime hosts over the five-year period. Roxborogh, Rose and Greg Prebble had turns at the drive show, and Gael Ludlow, Ramsay and Mark Bramley had turns hosting Love Songs &#x27;til Midnight. The John Tesh Radio Show was moved to weekend afternoons, and overnight and on weekend nights the station was automated.

Bee Gees musician Barry Gibb used an interview with Roxborogh on Easy Mix in September 2009 to confirm he and his brother and bandmate Robin Gibb were planning to tour again. In 2010, the Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint against an advertisement for a Christmas club card broadcast on Easy Mix. The ad featured a childlike voice saying he wouldn&#x27;t receive a &quot;clip around the ear&quot; and &quot;life won&#x27;t be a bitch&quot; because his family is part of the scheme. The network said the ad was supposed to be humorous, but the authority ruled it was inappropriate for families listening to Easy Mix during the day.

The network was taken off-air on 22 June 2012. The FM frequencies were taken over by Radio Sport, and some of the playlist was carried over to Classic Hits and Coast. APN News &amp; Media said the loss of Easy Mix revenue and investment in digital media like iHeartRadio pushed down the profit of its New Zealand radio business that year. Commentator John Drinnan said the problems that caused Easy Mix to close stemmed from the decision to rebrand Easy Listening i as Viva in 2005. The New Zealand Herald reported former host Simon Dallow was sad to see it go off-air, and was putting it down to the &quot;changing place of the modern broadcasting environment&quot;.

===Mix===

In June 2014 the Mix was relaunched on the Auckland 98.2 FM frequency with a new format, playlist, programme line-up and branding. It began as Mix 98.2 and, according to radio survey figures, it had around 29,000 listeners after 12 weeks on air. In 2015 the station extended to Christchurch on 91.7FM and the station was renamed to Mix. In 2016 the station extended to Wellington on 93.7FM, Nelson on 104.0FM and Whangarei on 89.2FM. In 2018 the station extended to Tauranga on 99.0FM, Rotorua on 94.3FM and New Plymouth on 106.0FM. In January 2020, Radio Hauraki replaced Mix on 94.3FM in Rotorua. In June 2020, Coast replaced Mix on 98.2FM in Auckland.

The Mix frequencies were rebranded Gold on 1 July 2020. In Auckland, Gold has replaced Coast (a simulcast of 98.2FM) on 105.4FM. The Mix programme ended on iHeartRadio on 18 September 2020, the last song played on the programme was &quot;Weak in the Presence of Beauty&quot; by Alison Moyet.

Easy Listening i made a return to Christchurch in 2003, broadcasting on 1593AM, and was networked into Dunedin in 2003 on 954AM. Both stations were replaced with Coast in 2004.

==Former stations==
===Auckland===

Mix 98.2 and its previous formats have broadcast in Auckland on 98.2 FM since 1990. The station was broadcast from a transmitter on the Sky Tower (Auckland) since 1997 and the frequency was briefly used by Radio Sport between 2012 and 2014. On 1 June 2020, Mix 98.2 was replaced by Coast.

===Hawke&#x27;s Bay===

The Easy Listening i station in Hawke&#x27;s Bay started as The Alligator 90FM in 1994. It broadcast on 90.3 FM from central Napier, with an adult contemporary format that had been missing from the market at the time. It used positioning statements like &quot;Better Music Variety and Less Talking&quot;, and &quot;The Original FM Music Station for Adults&quot;. Its staff and announcers included Graeme Parsonage, Andrew Jefferies, James Milner, Virgil Troy and Julie-Ann Barnes. Mark Bramley joined the station, and later went to host Easy Mix&#x27;s night show in 2010.

Within months of the station&#x27;s launch, a second transmitter was installed on Bluff Hill and relayed the programmes to Napier Hill and Port residents on 99.9 FM. The station was renamed The Alligator 90-100FM, and then Easy Listening i90. In mid-1996 the station was sold to Hawke&#x27;s Bay Media Group, keeping a local breakfast programme but phasing out local programmes at other times of the day. The 99.9 frequency was used to set up a new youth station called Xtreme 100 fronted by Mark McCarron and Rick Toner (Breakfast), with Jason Reeves (Xtreme nights). At the end of 1997 the station reverted to local programmes and changed its name to Easy Listening 90FM. Hawke&#x27;s Bay Media Group changed its name to Independent Radio, and in 1999 it was renamed again to 90.3 Cool FM.

In 2000 the company was purchased The Radio Network, the station reverted to Easy Listening i90.3FM, and dropped all locally programmes. On 31 May 2011, the station closed down and the frequency switched to Newstalk ZB. On 1 March 2012, Easy Mix was relaunched on 96.7FM replacing Flava. The Radio Network said there was &quot;constant listener and advertiser demand for the station to return.&quot; However, the Easy Mix network closed just four months later, and the frequency was taken over by Radio Sport. Mix did return to Hawke&#x27;s Bay on 1584AM shifting Radio Hauraki to 96.7FM before it closed down.

===News and information===

Mix broadcast pre-recorded news, sport and weather updates from the NZME newsroom.

===Website and social media===

The Mix website included photo galleries, lifestyle news, entertainment news, humour videos and event listings. The station was available via audio streaming on the iHeartRadio website and app.

<doc id="954001" wikidata="Q3607764" url="?curid=954001" title="Alan Morton">
<text>Alan Lauder Morton (24 April 1893 – 12 December 1971) was a Scottish footballer who played as an outside left for Queen&#x27;s Park, Rangers and Scotland.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Morton was born in the Jordanhill district of Glasgow. He grew up in Airdrie, where his family relocated due to his father&#x27;s work. After leaving Airdrie Academy he had an unsuccessful trial with Airdrieonians. Consequently, he entered studies to become a mining engineer while playing with Queen&#x27;s Park, the famous amateur club. Once fully qualified in 1920 he turned professional, becoming Bill Struth&#x27;s first signing as manager of Rangers, but only on the proviso that he could maintain his position as a mining engineer.

Morton only measured 5 ft 4 inches in height but his talent lay in his physical balance, speed and thought. Rangers enjoyed a sustained period of success, winning the Scottish league championship in 1921, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930 and 1931. Highlights included the 1928 Scottish Cup Final win against Celtic, which ended a 25‑year wait to win the Scottish Cup.

He made his debut for Rangers against Airdrieonians on 17 August 1920, and played his last game against the same opposition on 7 January 1933 (in which he scored). &quot;The Wee Blue Devil&quot;, as he was nicknamed, played 470 times for the &quot;Gers&quot; and scored 109 goals.

===International===
Morton made his international debut for Scotland on 26 February 1920 against Wales. He would go on to play in every international against the &quot;Auld Enemy&quot;, England, from 1920 to 1932 bar the fixture at Old Trafford in 1926, eventually winning 31 caps. It was in the 1928 full international in London where Morton, as part of an underrated Scottish side that beat England 5–1 in driving rain to record a famous triumph, earned the moniker: &quot;Wembley Wizards&quot;. Three of Morton&#x27;s crosses were converted by Huddersfield Town&#x27;s Alex Jackson. Ivan Sharpe, the ex‑player and writer, commented on the victory: &quot;England were not merely beaten. They were bewildered – run to a standstill, made to appear utterly inferior by a team whose play was as cultured and beautiful as I ever expect to see.&quot;

In addition he made 15 appearances (scoring 1 goal) for the Scottish League XI (making his debut on 22 February 1919 against the Football League at St. Andrew&#x27;s, Birmingham after playing in three wartime fundraising matches) and four Scotland wartime appearances (a charity match and three Victory Internationals).

==Retirement==
After retiring Morton became an important administrator within Scottish sport. He was appointed to the Rangers board of directors and he remained there until the year of his death. Further afield, he demonstrated an inclination toward Unionist politics in reaction to the rise in post-War Scottish nationalism. He also owned a coal business in central Scotland. Today a portrait of Morton in his Scottish strip stands at the top of the marble staircase at Ibrox&#x27;s Main Stand, such is his enduring stature at the club.

==Personal life==
His elder brother Bob Morton also played for Queen&#x27;s Park, where the siblings were teammates for six seasons.

* The existence of the thermodynamic limit for the free energy and spin correlations were proved by Ginibre, extending to this case the Griffiths inequality.
* Using the Griffiths inequality in the formulation of Ginibre, Aizenman and Simon proved that the two point spin correlation of the &quot;ferromagnetics&quot; XY model in dimension , coupling and inverse temperature is &quot;dominated&quot; by (i.e. has an upper bound given by) the two point correlation of the &quot;ferromagnetic&quot; Ising model in dimension , coupling and inverse temperature formula_5 Hence the critical of the XY model cannot be smaller than the double of the critical of the Ising model formula_6

===One dimension===
As in any &#x27;nearest-neighbor&#x27; &quot;n&quot;-vector model with free (non-periodic) boundary conditions, if the external field is zero, there exists a simple exact solution. In the free boundary conditions case, the Hamiltonian is
formula_7
therefore the partition function factorizes under the change of coordinates
formula_8
This gives 
formula_9
where formula_10 is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. The partition function can be used to find several important thermodynamic quantities. For example, in the thermodynamic limit (formula_11), the free energy per spin is
formula_12
Using the properties of the modified Bessel functions, the specific heat (per spin) can be expressed as
formula_13
where formula_14, and formula_15 is the short-range correlation function, 
formula_16

Even in the thermodynamic limit, there is no divergence in the specific heat. Indeed, like the one-dimensional Ising model, the one-dimensional XY model has no phase transitions at finite temperature.

The same computation for periodic boundary condition (and still ) requires the transfer matrix formalism, though the result is the same.

This transfer matrix approach is also required when using free boundary conditions, but with an applied field formula_17. If the applied field formula_18 is small enough that it can be treated as a perturbation to the system in zero-field, then the magnetic susceptibility formula_19 can be estimated. This is done by using the eigenstates computed by the transfer matrix approach and computing the energy shift with second-order perturbation theory, then comparing with the free-energy expansion formula_20. One finds 
formula_21
where formula_22 is the Curie constant (a value typically associated with the susceptibility in magnetic materials). This expression is also true for the one-dimensional Ising model, with the replacement formula_23.

===Two dimensions===

The two-dimensional XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions is an example of a two-dimensional system with continuous symmetry that does not have long-range order as required by the Mermin–Wagner theorem. Likewise, there is not a conventional phase transition present that would be associated with symmetry breaking. However, as will be discussed later, the system does show signs of a transition from a disordered high-temperature state to a quasi-ordered state below some critical temperature, called the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In the case of a discrete lattice of spins, the two-dimensional XY model can be evaluated using the transfer matrix approach, reducing the model to an eigenvalue problem and utilizing the largest eigenvalue from the transfer matrix. Though the exact solution is intractable, it is possible to use certain approximations to get estimates for the critical temperature formula_24 which occurs at low temperatures. For example, Mattis (1984) used an approximation to this model to estimate a critical temperature of the system as
formula_25
formula_26 
The 2D XY model has also been studied in great detail using Monte Carlo simulations, for example with the Metropolis algorithm. These can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities like the system energy, specific heat, magnetization, etc., over a range of temperatures and time-scales. In the Monte Carlo simulation, each spin is associated to a continuously-varying angle formula_27 (often, it can be discretized into finitely-many angles, like in the related Potts model, for ease of computation. However, this is not a requirement.) At each time step the Metropolis algorithm chooses one spin at random and rotates its angle by some random increment formula_28. This change in angle causes a change in the energy formula_29 of the system, which can be positive or negative. If negative, the algorithm accepts the change in angle; if positive, the configuration is accepted with probability formula_30, the Boltzmann factor for the energy change. The Monte Carlo method has been used to verify, with various methods, the critical temperature of the system, and is estimated to be formula_31. The Monte Carlo method can also compute average values that are used to compute thermodynamic quantities like magnetization, spin-spin correlation, correlation lengths, and specific heat. These are important ways to characterize the behavior of the system near the critical temperature. The magnetization and squared magnetization, for example, can be computed as 

formula_32
formula_33
where formula_34 are the number of spins. The mean magnetization characterizes the magnitude of the net magnetic moment of the system; in many magnetic systems this is zero above a critical temperature and becomes non-zero spontaneously at low temperatures. Similarly the mean-squared magnetization characterizes the average of the square of net components of the spins across the lattice. Either of these are commonly used to characterize the order parameter of a system. Rigorous analysis of the XY model shows the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit is zero, and that the square magnetization approximately follows formula_35, which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. Indeed, at high temperatures this quantity approaches zero since the components of the spins will tend to be randomized and thus sum to zero. However at low temperatures for a finite system, the mean-square magnetization increases, suggesting there are regions of the spin space that are aligned to contribute to a non-zero contribution. The magnetization shown (for a 25x25 lattice) is one example of this, that appears to suggest a phase transition, while no such transition exists in the thermodynamic limit.

Furthermore, using statistical mechanics one can relate thermodynamic averages to quantities like specific heat by calculating
formula_36
The specific heat is shown at low temperatures near the critical temperature formula_37. There is no feature in the specific heat consistent with critical behavior (like a divergence) at this predicted temperature. Indeed, estimating the critical temperature comes from other methods, like from the helicity modulus, or the temperature dependence of the divergence of susceptibility. However, there is a feature in the specific heat in the form of a peak at formula_38. This peak position and height have been shown not to depend on system size, for lattices of linear size greater than 256; indeed, the specific heat anomaly remains rounded and finite for increasing lattice size, with no divergent peak.

The nature of the critical transitions and vortex formation can be elucidated by considering a continuous version of the XY model. Here, the discrete spins formula_39 are replaced by a field formula_40 representing the spin&#x27;s angle at any point in space. In this case the angle of the spins formula_40 must vary smoothly over changes in position. Expanding the original cosine as a Taylor series, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in the continuum approximation as 
formula_42
thumb|350px|Color map of the (discrete) two-dimensional XY model in a 250x250 lattice at formula_43. Each spin is represented by a color that corresponds to an angle between formula_44. Note the periodic boundary conditions.
The continuous version of the XY model is often used to model systems that possess order parameters with the same kinds of symmetry, e.g. superfluid helium, hexatic liquid crystals. This is what makes them peculiar from other phase transitions which are always accompanied with a symmetry breaking. Topological defects in the XY model lead to a vortex-unbinding transition from the low-temperature phase to the high-temperature disordered phase. Indeed, the fact that at high temperature correlations decay exponentially fast, while at low temperatures decay with power law, even though in both regimes , is called Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. Kosterlitz and Thouless provided a simple argument of why this would be the case: this considers the ground state consisting of all spins in the same orientation, with the addition then of a single vortex. The presence of these contributes an entropy of roughly formula_45, where formula_46 is an effective length scale (for example, the lattice size for a discrete lattice) Meanwhile, the energy of the system increases due to the vortex, by an amount formula_47. Putting these together, the free energy of a system would change due to the spontaneous formation of a vortex by an amount
formula_48
In the thermodynamic limit, the system does not favor the formation of vortices at low temperatures, but does favor them at high temperatures, above the critical temperature formula_49. This indicates that at low temperatures, any vortices that arise will want to annihilate with antivortices to lower the system energy. Indeed, this will be the case qualitatively if one watches &#x27;snapshots&#x27; of the spin system at low temperatures, where vortices and antivortices gradually come together to annihilate. Thus, the low-temperature state will consist of bound vortex-antivortex pairs. Meanwhile at high temperatures, there will be a collection of unbound vortices and antivortices that are free to move about the plane.

To visualize the Ising model, one can use an arrow pointing up or down, or represented as a point colored black/white to indicate its state. To visualize the XY spin system, the spins can be represented as an arrow pointing in some direction, or as being represented as a point with some color. Here it is necessary to represent the spin with a spectrum of colors due to each of the possible continuous variables. This can be done using, for example, a continuous and periodic red-green-blue spectrum. As shown on the figure, cyan corresponds to a zero angle (pointing to the right), whereas red corresponds to a 180 degree angle (pointing to the left). One can then study snapshots of the spin configurations at different temperatures to elucidate what happens above and below the critical temperature of the XY model. At high temperatures, the spins will not have a preferred orientation and there will be unpredictable variation of angles between neighboring spins, as there will be no preferred energetically favorable configuration. In this case, the color map will look highly pixellated. Meanwhile at low temperatures, one possible ground-state configuration has all spins pointed in the same orientation (same angle); these would correspond to regions (domains) of the color map where all spins have roughly the same color.

To identify vortices (or antivortices) present as a result of the Kosterlitz–Thouless transition, one can determine the signed change in angle by traversing a circle of lattice points counterclockwise. If the total change in angle is zero, this corresponds to no vortex being present; whereas a total change in angle of formula_50 corresponds to a vortex (or antivortex). These vortexes are topologically non-trivial objects that come in vortex-antivortex pairs, which can separate or pair-annihilate. In the colormap, these defects can be identified in regions where there is a large color gradient where all colors of the spectrum meet around a point. Qualitatively, these defects can look like inward- or outward-pointing sources of flow, or whirlpools of spins that collectively clockwise or counterclockwise, or hyperbolic-looking features with some spins pointing toward and some spins pointing away from the defect. As the configuration is studied at long time scales and at low temperatures, it is observed that many of these vortex-antivortex pairs get closer together and eventually pair-annihilate. It is only at high temperatures that these vortices and antivortices are liberated and unbind from one another.

In the continuous XY model, the high-temperature spontaneous magnetization vanishes:
formula_51
Besides, cluster expansion shows that the spin correlations cluster exponentially fast: for instance
formula_52
At low temperatures, i.e. , the spontaneous magnetization remains zero (see the Mermin–Wagner theorem),
formula_53
but the decay of the correlations is only power law: Fröhlich and Spencer found the lower bound 
:formula_54
while McBryan and Spencer found the upper bound, for any formula_55
:formula_56

===Three and higher dimensions===
Independently of the range of the interaction, at low enough temperature the magnetization is positive.

* At high temperature, the spontaneous magnetization vanishes: formula_57. Besides, cluster expansion shows that the spin correlations cluster exponentially fast: for instance formula_58.
* At low temperature, infrared bound shows that the spontaneous magnetization is strictly positive: formula_59. Besides, there exists a 1-parameter family of extremal states, formula_60, such that formula_61 but, conjecturally, in each of these extremal states the truncated correlations decay algebraically.

== Phase transition ==
As mentioned above in one dimension the XY model does not have a phase transition, while in two dimensions it has the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the phases with exponentially and powerlaw decaying correlation functions.

In three and higher dimensions the XY model has a ferromagnet-paramagnet phase transition. At low temperatures the spontaneous magnetization is nonzero: this is the ferromagnetic phase. As the temperature is increased, spontaneous magnetization gradually decreases and vanishes at a critical temperature. It remains zero at all higher temperatures: this is the paramagnetic phase.

In four and higher dimensions the phase transition has mean field theory critical exponents (with logarithmic corrections in four dimensions).

=== Three dimensional case: the critical exponents ===
The three dimensional case is interesting because the critical exponents at the phase transition are nontrivial. Many three-dimensional physical systems belong to the same universality class as the three dimensional XY model and share the same critical exponents, most notably easy-plane magnets and liquid Helium-4. The values of these critical exponents are measured by experiments, Monte Carlo simulations, and can also be computed by theoretical methods of quantum field theory, such as the renormalization group and the conformal bootstrap. Renormalization group methods are applicable because the critical point of the XY model is believed to be described by a renormalization group fixed point. Conformal bootstrap methods are applicable because it is also believed to be a unitary three dimensional conformal field theory.

Most important critical exponents of the three dimensional XY model are formula_62. All of them can be expressed via just two numbers: the scaling dimensions formula_63 and formula_64 of the complex order parameter field formula_65 and of the leading singlet operator formula_66 (same asformula_67 in the Ginzburg–Landau description). Another important field is formula_68(same as formula_69), whose dimension formula_70 determines the correction-to-scaling exponent formula_71. According to a conformal bootstrap computation, these three dimensions are given by: 

This gives the following values of the critical exponents:
Monte Carlo methods give compatible determinations: formula_72.

<doc id="954009" wikidata="Q7280833" url="?curid=954009" title="Radio Hauraki">
<text>Radio Hauraki is a New Zealand rock music station that started in 1966. It was the first private commercial radio station of the modern broadcasting era in New Zealand and operated illegally until 1970 to break the monopoly held by the state-owned New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation. From its founding until 2012 Hauraki played a mix of classic and mainstream rock music. In 2013, it changed its music content, playing modern rock and alternative rock from the last 25–30 years. As of 2019 more classic rock and progressive rock is being increasingly played. In its modern legal form, Radio Hauraki&#x27;s head office and main studios are now located at 2 Graham Street in the Auckland CBD, as one of eight stations of NZME Radio.

Private commercial radio stations had operated from the earliest days of broadcasting, but the government began to close them down, the process accelerating after World War II. To break the state monopoly, Radio Hauraki was originally formed as a pirate station in the Hauraki Gulf, in a history that saw the loss of one life.

==History==

===Early years===

The concept of Radio Hauraki originated with a group of journalists who felt dissatisfied with New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC) radio stations, and with the politics involved with broadcasting in New Zealand. Private stations were able to apply for licences to operate, but the New Zealand Broadcasting Service (NZBS) stonewalled all applications. A small group involving David Gapes, Derek Lowe, Ian Magan, Chris Parkinson and Denis O&#x27;Callahan
decided, with legal assistance, to start a private venture operating in international waters, outside of the confines of the monopolistic government departments of the NZBC, which ran all land-based radio stations, and of the New Zealand Post Office, which managed the radio spectrum. Gapes, Lowe, Magan, Parkinson and O&#x27;Callahan eventually broke the radio monopoly, thus allowing private radio to become widespread in New Zealand.

The five men bought a boat and tried to make it seaworthy, however the Marine Department continuously rejected their application for a warrant of fitness for the ship. So in 1966 the crew set sail anyway without the WOF. However the ship got caught on a drawbridge in the Auckland Viaduct and the crew were arrested. When they went to court the judge ruled in favour of them and in late 1966, the &quot;Tiri&quot;, the boat chosen to carry the transmitter, anchored in the Hauraki Gulf outside the 3-mile territorial-water limit. The station broadcast on the frequency of 1480 kHz – well outside the range of frequencies used by the NZBC. After testing the transmitter with a broadcast from pirate announcer Bob Leahy, and having to replace the mast after winds of more than 30 knots knocked it down, Radio Hauraki officially started broadcasting on 4 December 1966.

===Pirate radio===
During the next two years, the crew on the &quot;Tiri&quot; would endure adverse weather conditions, fatigue, and continued efforts to shut down the station. On 28 January 1968 disaster struck as the &quot;Tiri&quot; attempted to negotiate its way into Whangaparapara Harbour on Great Barrier Island in foul weather. The ship ran aground on rocks, with Radio Hauraki disc jockey Paul Lineham keeping listeners up-to-date with running commentary. The final broadcast from the &quot;Tiri&quot; was &quot;Hauraki News: Hauraki crew is abandoning ship. This is Paul Lineham aboard the &#x27;Tiri&#x27;. Good Night.&quot; followed by a station jingle. The &quot;Tiri&quot; was later towed back to Auckland and the broadcasting equipment was salvaged. However, the &quot;Tiri&quot; herself was beyond repair and was replaced four days later by the &quot;Kapuni&quot;, christened &quot;Tiri II&quot; by her new crew. A month after the loss of the &quot;Tiri&quot;, Radio Hauraki was back in international waters and broadcasting again.

In April of the same year &quot;Tiri II&quot; found herself beached again at Whangaparapara Harbour, a victim of the same storm that resulted in the &quot;Wahine&quot; disaster. After repairs she was back at sea in five days. Between this time and June 1968, &quot;Tiri II&quot; would end up beached at Uretiti Beach and caught several times broadcasting from New Zealand waters by radio inspectors. Just before Christmas 1968, Radio Hauraki became New Zealand&#x27;s first 24-hour broadcasting radio station. Radio Hauraki was not live radio. The studios were land-based and most programs were recorded on reel-to-reel tapes in -hour segments approximately one week prior to their broadcast. This meant that while contests, current top tunes, etc. could be accommodated, news and weather were more of a challenge.

Tiri was owned by AG Frankham Ltd and was registered as a barge. After running aground at Whangaparapara on 28 January 1968, it was laid up at Limestone Island near Whangarei. The search and rescue boat Marauder was owned by Bill Gibbs and Tryphena. Kapuni, also owned by AG Frankham Ltd, became known as Tiri II only during Hauraki service from 1968 to 1970. It was laid up on Rotoroa Island in the Hauraki Gulf.

===Legal radio===

In mid-1970, the state monopoly on radio frequencies was broken, with the New Zealand Broadcasting Authority finally allowing Radio Hauraki to broadcast on land, legally. The Radio Hauraki crew had spent 1,111 days at sea. The final broadcast from the seabound Hauraki Pirates was a documentary on the station&#x27;s history until that point, finishing at 10:00 pm when &quot;Tiri II&quot; turned and headed for Auckland playing &quot;Born Free&quot; continually. During their final voyage back to shore, announcer Rick Grant was lost overboard.

On 23 November 1978, Radio Hauraki moved from 1480 kHz to 1476 kHz as part of the change from 10 kHz spacing to 9 kHz spacing on the AM band.

Radio Hauraki began FM transmission in 1990 on 99.0FM, and the 1476 kHz frequency was subsequently acquired by a local community group to broadcast the BBC World Service. During the late nineties Radio Hauraki was networked into other regions around the North Island of New Zealand and in 2003 Radio Hauraki was networked into the South Island in Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. Veteran pirate announcer Bob Leahy remained a newsreader for The Radio Network right up until 2009, which saw him remain on-air on Radio Hauraki some 40 years after he helped begin the station.

After several changes in ownership Radio Hauraki is now operated by NZME Radio becoming a radio network broadcasting across New Zealand. Up until 2012 Hauraki played a mix of classic and mainstream rock music from the &#x27;60s til now. In 2013, Hauraki changed its music content playing modern rock and alternative rock from the last 25 years, also changed their positioning statement to &quot;It&#x27;s Different&quot; to coincide with their change in format. Current hosts include high-profile personalities such as: Matt Heath, Jeremy Wells, Mikey Havoc, Leigh Hart, Jason Hoyte, Steve Simpson and Tim Batt. The station claims its recent changes have resulted in a substantial increase in listeners. A film dramatising Radio Hauraki&#x27;s early years, &quot;3 Mile Limit&quot;, was released in 2014.

He left the station in 1985 to return to the United Kingdom and become one of Britain&#x27;s most well-known television personalities. During almost 30 years as a BBC Television and ITV presenter, Schofield was the first continuity announcer for Children&#x27;s BBC and the host of the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, Dancing on Ice, All Star Mr &amp; Mrs, The Cube and This Morning.

Former breakfast host Kevin Black became New Zealand&#x27;s highest-paid radio DJ, and served as breakfast host for Solid Gold between 1997 and 2009 before his death in 2013.

<text>The Sound, previously known as Solid Gold FM, is a New Zealand radio network owned by MediaWorks New Zealand. Solid Gold began broadcasting on 13 October 1997 and was rebranded as The Sound on 1 January 2012. The Sound has a classic rock format, playing &quot;the greatest music of all time&quot; from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The station appeals to an older audience than most popular and rock music stations in New Zealand.

==History==

===As Solid Gold FM===

Solid Gold FM started in Auckland on 13 October 1997 broadcasting on 93.4FM. This frequency was previously used to broadcast Kool 93, a station that played a similar format to Solid Gold. After The Radio Network purchased Kool 93&#x27;s parent company, Prospect Media Ltd, the Commerce Commission ruled that The Radio Network had to sell or dispose of some of their Auckland frequencies as a condition of the sale, and as a result they closed Kool 93, with the frequency going to Energy Enterprises.

For several months during 1997, 93.4FM was used to play temporary programme advising listeners of the launch of a new station coming soon. Solid Gold&#x27;s original line up was Breakfast with Blackie and Jennifer (Kevin Black and Jenny Marcroft), Adam &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Butler (10 am - 2 pm), Big Tony Amos (2 pm - 7 pm) and Brian Staff (7 pm - midnight). Following the launch in Auckland, Energy Enterprises (which later became RadioWorks) rolled the station out across New Zealand as they were able to secure frequencies in each market. In some markets local stations were closed down and replaced with Solid Gold, as there were markets where RadioWorks had taken over more than one local station. Solid Gold was eventually available in 25 markets across New Zealand.

During the station&#x27;s early days, the playlist featured mostly music from the 1950s and 1960s. Music from the 1950s was dropped in the early 2000s, with the station focusing on 1960s and 1970s music for most of the decade. The station has run several promotions sending listeners overseas, for example, to see Bruce Springsteen, to Graceland, 10 friends to Fiji, 10 friends to the Gold Coast, the 1000 Greatest Hits of the 60s and 70s countdown and more.

In 2009, long-term Breakfast host Kevin Black retired, and Blackie&#x27;s Big Breakfast (featuring Alan (AJ) Whetton and David Burke-Kennedy) was replaced by Muzza in the Morning, with host Murray Inglis. A former breakfast host on Auckland&#x27;s Radio Hauraki, Black was once the highest-paid private radio DJ in New Zealand. His 12-year spell with Solid Gold between 1997 and 2009 was his last on-air role until he died in 2013, just short of his 70th birthday. Murray Inglis left the breakfast show in late 2010 and was replaced by Mark McCarron.

From 25 December 2010 the station changed their positioning statement to &quot;The Greatest Hits of all time&quot;, and no longer played only 1960s and 1970s music. Daytime announcer Macca, who had been with the station since 1998, had his last show with Solid Gold on 30 December 2011 and did not continue with The Sound. Afternoon host Rick Rennie and former night host Peter Dakin also left.

===As The Sound===

The station relaunched as The Sound at 9 am on 1 January 2012. The last song on Solid Gold FM was &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot; by Sam Cooke. The first song played on The Sound, following a 5-minute profile intro, was Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding&quot;. Breakfast host Mark McCarron hosted the first show on The Sound.

The Sound features a classic rock format, which broadcasts on all existing Solid Gold frequencies over the country. The change was made in response to competing stations Classic Hits and Radio Hauraki choosing to play newer music. The change fills the gap in 1970s and 1980s music no longer played by these stations.

Mark McCarron left the breakfast show in June 2014, to make way for The Kennedy and Staufer Breakfast with Mark Kennedy and Mark Staufer. Kennedy and Staufer were well known to Auckland listeners as the breakfast duo on Auckland&#x27;s 89FM during the 1980s hosting a breakfast show called &quot;The Top Marks&quot;. The show was cancelled in July 2014, after co-host Mark Staufer reportedly used foul language during a late-night talkback slot he was co-hosting with Ian Wishart on Radio Live. The talkback slot also included frank and explicit discussion about masturbation and teenage abortion, with his co-host blaming his poor choice of words on tiredness. He immediately lost his place on the late-night talkback slot. The situation was reviewed by MediaWorks New Zealand management and the breakfast programme was cancelled just five weeks after it had begun. Following the cancellation of The Kennedy and Staufer Breakfast show Mark McCarron was reinstated as breakfast presenter with co-host Leah Panapa. Mark McCarron left the station at the end of 2015.
