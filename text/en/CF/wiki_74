<text>Mary Lillian Ellison (July 22, 1923 – November 2, 2007) was an American professional wrestler, promoter and trainer better known by her ring name The Fabulous Moolah.

She began her career working with promoter Billy Wolfe and his wife, wrestler and trainer Mildred Burke, as well as working alongside professional wrestler &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers. She won the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship in 1956 and was the most prominent holder of the title for 28 years. She is overall an eight-time women&#x27;s world champion and to this day holds the record as the longest reigning world champion in combination of all her reigns.

In the 1980s, she joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) as part of the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection storyline, feuding with Cyndi Lauper and Wendi Richter, the latter of whom defeated her for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship in the main event of The Brawl to End It All in 1984. Moolah regained the Women&#x27;s Championship on two further occasions before entering semi-retirement towards the end of the decade. She continued to make sporadic appearances for WWF/WWE until her death, often in comedic roles with longtime friend Mae Young. In 1999, she became the oldest champion in the history of professional wrestling, up to that point in time, when she won the Women&#x27;s Championship for a final time at age 76.

During her lifetime, Moolah was lauded as a leading figure in women&#x27;s professional wrestling and was considered one of the industry&#x27;s most known lady wrestlers. She became the first woman to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1995 and is also a member of the NWA Hall of Fame and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. However, her legacy has since been damaged in the years following her death, when allegations surfaced that she had exploited female wrestlers under her tutelage both financially and sexually.

== Early life ==
Mary Lillian Ellison was born in 1923 in Kershaw County, South Carolina, and grew up in Tookiedoo, 12 miles from Columbia. The youngest of five children, Ellison was the only daughter of Henry Lee and Suzann Atkinson Ellisor. 

When her mother died of cancer, eight-year-old Ellison went to live with her paternal grandmother and worked on her cousin&#x27;s cotton farm to make money. At age 10, Ellison was still deeply distraught over her mother&#x27;s death; to cheer her up, her father took her to the local wrestling matches. Ellison liked the matches, but it was not until she saw Women&#x27;s Champion Mildred Burke wrestle that &quot;they began to mean much more&quot; to her.

Ellison returned to the Columbia home of her father and brothers. She graduated from Columbia High School, and married L. Walter Carroll. They soon became parents to a daughter. A few months after the birth of her daughter, she divorced Carroll., leaving her daughter with a friend and setting out on a wrestling career of her own.

== Professional wrestling career ==
===National Wrestling Alliance (1949–1983)===
==== Early career (1949–1955) ====
Ellison began her wrestling career with Mildred Burke&#x27;s husband Billy Wolfe, the dominant women&#x27;s promoter of the time. She competed with many established female wrestlers, like Mae Young, Cecilia Blevins and Mildred Burke. Wolfe was notorious for advising his wrestlers to enter into sexual relationships with either himself or competing promoters to ensure additional bookings, a practice with which Ellison refused to go along. She, however, soon began a romance with wrestler Johnny Long. Long later introduced Ellison to Jack Pfefer who gave her the moniker &quot;Slave Girl Moolah&quot;. By the early 1950s, Moolah was a valet for &quot;Nature Boy&quot; Buddy Rogers, accompanying him to the ring while providing eye candy for the male audiences and assisting Rogers against his opponents. Ellison broke up the partnership because Rogers kept pushing her to begin a sexual relationship. She then served as the valet for the Elephant Boy (Tony Olivas). Olivas was Mexican, but had very dark skin, which caused controversy when Ellison, a white woman, would kiss him on the cheek during their ring entrance routine. At one show in Oklahoma City, a man, who thought that Olivas was a black man, attempted to stab Ellison with a knife for kissing him. Moolah later left Pfeffer&#x27;s promotion and began wrestling under Boston promoters Tony Santos and Paul Bowser. In 1955, she began working for Vince McMahon, Sr.&#x27;s Capitol Wrestling Corporation.

==== World Champion (1956–1983) ====

On September 18, 1956, Moolah defeated Judy Grable in a 13-woman battle royal to win the vacant World Women&#x27;s Championship, which shares a lineage with the NWA World Women&#x27;s Championship. She was not immediately recognized by everyone as the NWA Champion because Billy Wolfe, with whom she had conflict earlier in her career, still controlled the promotion. After the match, Vince McMahon, Sr. dubbed Ellison with a new ring name – The Fabulous Moolah. Subsequently, June Byers came out of retirement to challenge Moolah to a match for the title. During the match, Moolah acted as the aggressor and pinned Byers to retain the championship. Moolah&#x27;s first World Championship reign lasted over ten years. Moolah successfully defended the belt against the top female wrestlers in the world, such as Judy Grable and Donna Christanello, while also purporting to befriend some of the biggest celebrities of the day. Moolah claimed in her book, &quot;First Goddess of the Squared Circle&quot;, that she formed friendships with Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.

After June Byers retired in 1964, Moolah was subsequently recognized as official NWA Champion, thus making her the undisputed Women&#x27;s World Champion. Nevertheless, Moolah dropped the belt on September 17, 1966, to Bette Boucher, although she regained the title just weeks later. She also traded the belt with Yukiko Tomoe during a tour of Japan in 1968. On July 1, 1972, Moolah became the first woman allowed to wrestle at Madison Square Garden, which had previously banned women&#x27;s wrestling. In fact, Moolah helped overturn the ban on women&#x27;s wrestling in the entire state of New York, which the New York State Athletic Commission lifted in June 1972. During her quest to overturn the ban, she flipped football player Roosevelt &quot;Rosey&quot; Grier onto his back on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. Moolah continued an uninterrupted eight-year reign before losing to Sue Green at Madison Square Garden in 1976. Moolah regained her title a short time later. She also bought the legal rights to the championship in the late 1970s, and after losing the championship for two days to Evelyn Stevens in 1978, began another long reign, defending her title for another six years. Also in the 1970s, Moolah held the NWA Women&#x27;s World Tag Team Championship twice with Toni Rose.

===World Wrestling Federation (1983–1987)===

==== Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection (1983–1987) ====
In 1983, Vincent Kennedy McMahon began expanding the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) nationally, and Moolah sold him the rights to her Women&#x27;s World Championship. Moolah agreed to appear exclusively for the WWF, and thus became the first WWF Women&#x27;s Champion. The following year, singer Cyndi Lauper began a verbal feud with manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano, who long had a reputation of being a villain, that brought professional wrestling into mainstream culture in a storyline that became known as the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection.&quot; When it was finally time for Lauper and Albano to settle their differences in the ring, a match-up was scheduled with Albano representing Moolah against the challenge of Lauper&#x27;s protégé, Wendi Richter. After much buildup and hype, the Fabulous Moolah lost the championship to Richter on July 23, 1984, in the main event of &quot;The Brawl to End It All&quot;, which was broadcast live on MTV. Prior to the match, the WWF promoted Moolah as holding the championship for the previous 28 years.

After losing the title to Richter, Moolah aided Leilani Kai in defeating Richter for the title in February 1985. Richter won it back at the inaugural WrestleMania, but when Richter&#x27;s relationship soured with the WWF, Moolah donned a mask as &quot;The Spider Lady&quot; and regained the belt on November 25, 1985, in a controversial decision. Richter was never told she would be losing the title and fell victim to a real-life &quot;screwjob&quot; finish known as &quot;The Original Screwjob&quot;. Richter promptly quit the WWF afterward, while Moolah continued to be champion for another two years—excluding a six-day reign by Velvet McIntyre during a tour of Australia in 1986—before losing the belt to Sherri Martel on July 24, 1987. She later captained a team at the inaugural Survivor Series. Her team (Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin&#x27; Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels) defeated champion Martel and her team (Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie).

===American Wrestling Association (1988)===
On September 3, 1988, Moolah wrestled AWA World Women&#x27;s Champion Madusa Miceli to a double DQ on an independent card in Medina, Ohio. Afterwards Moolah would retire from wrestling.

===Ladies International Wrestling Association (1990–2000)===
During her retirement Moolah was the promoter for Ladies International Wrestling Association (LIWA) in 1990 based in North Carolina. Also the shows were held in Las Vegas. She started wrestling again in 1993 at the age of 70 when she defeated Sunny Brook. On June 21, 1996, she teamed with Mae Young at LIWA Golden Girls Extravaganza event in Las Vegas where they wrestled Liz Chase and Lori Lynn to a no contest. Moolah continued wrestling for the promotion and even continued teaming with Young. In 2000, while working for WWF; LIWA shut down. Moolah would continue working for WWF.

=== Return to WWF/E and Hall of Fame (1995, 1999–2007) ===
Throughout the early 1990s, she made appearances in video packages and at live WWF events. On June 24, 1995, she was the first female wrestler to be inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame. In the late 1990s, Pat Patterson and Ellison began jokingly discussing a comeback for her, which resulted in Patterson contacting WWF Chairman Vince McMahon about the possibility. 

In 1999, Moolah and Mae Young re-emerged in the WWF (later renamed World Wrestling Entertainment, WWE). The WWF women&#x27;s division, however, had since moved away from the traditional athletic match-ups of the past and now featured women competing in sexually-themed bikini contests and strip matches.

Upon returning, Moolah and Young began appearing regularly in comedic roles. On the September 9, 1999, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Jeff Jarrett invited Moolah, 76, into the ring and smashed a guitar over her head. On the September 27, 1999, episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Moolah and Young defeated Ivory in a Handicapped Evening Gown match, which led to a title match at No Mercy on October 17. The match saw Moolah defeat Ivory to regain the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, thus becoming the then-oldest champion ever, though she lost the title back to Ivory eight days later.

On the September 15, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Moolah won a match against Victoria. Moolah had been promised the match for her eightieth birthday and became the first octogenarian to compete in a WWE ring. After Moolah&#x27;s victory, the &quot;Legend Killer&quot; Randy Orton came out and performed an &quot;RKO&quot; on her. Moolah and Young made another appearance at New Years Revolution in 2006, during a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match attacking Victoria and stripping her of her top. She also made brief appearances at WrestleMania 23 and the 2007 Draft Lottery on June 11, 2007. Her last WWE appearance before her death was at SummerSlam in August 2007, in a backstage segment with Vince McMahon and Raw General Manager William Regal.

== Training and promoting ==

Ellison and her second husband Johnny Long began training women to become female wrestlers, including Ella Waldek, Daisy Mae, and Katherine Simpson. Long later contacted promoter Jack Pfefer, who agreed to book some of the wrestlers at his shows. After marrying wrestler Buddy Lee, he began helping Ellison train the female wrestlers. After she left Pfeffer&#x27;s promotion in the 1950s, Ellison found it difficult to book her trainees in shows due to Pfeffer&#x27;s influence over other National Wrestling Alliance promoters. Ellison claimed Pfeffer would threaten to reveal the pre-planned nature of wrestling if any other promoters did not do as he liked. As a result, Ellison began selling cosmetics door-to-door and Lee opened a service station to make enough money to pay their bills. They later began to book their wrestlers, including Judy Grable in Boston, under promoter Paul Bowser.

In the late 1950s when the once-dominant promoter of women&#x27;s wrestling, Billy Wolfe, was out of business, Ellison and Lee began to book their female wrestlers for more and more shows. They began calling their promoting business Girl Wrestling Enterprises (GWE). Ellison demanded a lot from the girls of GWE, including that they had to keep their hair and make-up done, act like a lady, and not date men who were in the professional wrestling business. In addition to women, Ellison also trained midget professional wrestlers, including Katie Glass in the 1960s. Ellison founded the Ladies&#x27; International Wrestling Association, a non-profit organization to help retired professional wrestlers, in the late 1980s. In the 1990s, she spent most of her time training female wrestlers at her school in Columbia, South Carolina. She also began training men, including Del Wilkes, and in 1995 trained more men than women. She also spent time training in Los Angeles at Verne Langdon&#x27;s Slammers Gym.

==Allegations of exploitation==
===Financial and sexual exploitation===
Journalist Dave Meltzer wrote an obituary for Moolah in which he stated that &quot;different promoters had very different ideas of what being professional meant.&quot; Wrestling historian Tim Hornbaker said that Moolah &quot;chose not to&quot; break the &quot;dishonest, greedy&quot; practices established by her mentor Billy Wolfe. Pat Laprade and Dan Murphy, in their book &quot;Sisterhood of the Squared Circle&quot;, wrote that Moolah&#x27;s &quot;tactics could be just as ruthless and cutthroat as&quot; Don Corleone, from &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

Wendi Richter and Mad Maxine both claimed that Ellison did not actually train the wrestlers at her wrestling school. According to Richter, Ellison accepted payment of the training fee (which at the time of Richter&#x27;s training was $500) and had other female wrestlers within her camp (including Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Winona Littleheart, and Joyce Grable) train the new recruits; these women did not get paid for their additional work as trainers. Richter also claimed that Ellison required all women that received training at her camp to sign a contract that allowed Ellison to function as their booker and receive 25% of their booking fee. Trainees were also required to rent duplex apartments on Ellison&#x27;s property and they were responsible for paying her for rent and utilities. The training lasted six months and took place up to five hours per day inside a wrestling ring in a barn that lacked heating and air conditioning or fans. Mad Maxine said that due to owing Moolah both rent and training fees amounting to $1,500, the trainees &quot;went into debt to [Moolah] and she controlled their lives... It was an environment ripe for abuse.&quot; Maxine also said that when she went to work for WWF, Moolah was taking at least half of her earnings. Debbie Johnson, another former trainee of Ellison&#x27;s, stated that she was required to give Ellison 30% of her booking fee, and her paycheck was further reduced as Ellison deducted travel expenses, food, rent, and utilities before paying her. As a result, Johnson worked for Ellison for two years before she received any money. Johnson stated that Ellison would refuse to book certain women in her training camp if they angered her, and that Ellison monitored her and refused to let her leave the physical constraints of the training camp unless she was accompanied by someone else.

Over the years, various female wrestlers have come forward with stories accusing Ellison of being a pimp who often provided various wrestling promoters with unsuspecting female wrestlers that would be used as sex objects. Penny Banner directly described Moolah as a pimp who &quot;in return for money,&quot; rented her female trainees out &quot;in bulk&quot; to wrestling promoters so that the promoters and male wrestlers could have sex with them. Banner said the women who were &quot;sent on these tours were not told of this &#x27;arrangement&#x27; ahead of time,&quot; and that &quot;those who refused to have sex with wrestlers and promoters were raped.&quot; One of the most notorious accusations is from the family of Sweet Georgia Brown (Susie Mae McCoy), who was trained by Moolah and her husband, Buddy Lee. The &quot;Columbia Free Times&quot; reported allegations made by her daughter in 2006, in which she said her mother told her that she was often raped, given drugs, and made an addict in an intentional attempt by Ellison and Lee to control her. Ida Martinez, who wrestled during the 1960s, also recalls that many of the regional promoters &quot;demanded personal services&quot; before they would pay the female wrestlers. Mad Maxine described Moolah as an &quot;evil person,&quot; saying Moolah made money by sending trainees &quot;out to this guy in Arizona and pimped them out.&quot; In a 2002 interview, Luna Vachon claimed that when she was sixteen years old and training at Ellison&#x27;s camp, Ellison sent her out of state to be photographed by an older man. Although she remained clothed during the photo shoot, Vachon stated she felt taken advantage of by Ellison and the older man. Vachon also stated that her aunt, Vivian Vachon, witnessed Ellison abusing alcohol and having sex with her female trainees. Sandy Parker, a lesbian former pupil of Ellison&#x27;s, also claims that Ellison forbade her from going to any gay bars and tried to press her to date men. Parker says this enraged her, because &quot;(Moolah) was two-faced because she had her own little dalliances that we all knew about.&quot;

However, several former co-workers have spoken out in Ellison&#x27;s defense. Professional wrestler Shane Douglas said he never heard anybody speaking against Moolah during his career. Former female wrestler Beverly Shade also defended Moolah, claiming &quot;Moolah wasn&#x27;t that kind of person.&quot; Jerry Lawler also said he &quot;never heard or saw anything like that when I was in the business around Moolah and her girls.&quot; Former trainee Princess Victoria said Moolah never pimped any women or used drugs, but she did take money from them. Michael McCoy, Sweet Georgia Brown&#x27;s son, refuted allegations made by his sister, stating that she has an agenda and that the allegations are false. However, on the &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; episode about The Fabulous Moolah, Michael McCoy stated that she was indeed made to have sex with paying promoters. Bruce Prichard said she was protecting herself from the promoters and the only negative thing he heard of her was &quot;took a percentage of their pay, which was laid out in their contract clearly before they even started training, day one.&quot;

===Manipulation of the women&#x27;s wrestling industry in the United States===
As well as allegedly exploiting female wrestlers sexually, Ellison was accused of using her influence to control the women&#x27;s wrestling scene and ensure that other women did not gain greater recognition. In addition to being a key participant in the original screwjob on Wendi Richter, Ellison used her influence to take over the spot originally held by her protégé Mad Maxine on the animated series &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;. Maxine was about to receive a big push by Vince McMahon but left the WWF shortly afterwards, as Ellison was unwilling to provide her with additional bookings. Maxine said that Moolah never told her about the WWF&#x27;s plans to include her in the cartoon. Numerous other former trainees defected from Ellison after growing tired of sharing their paychecks with Ellison. Women wrestlers including Vivian and Luna Vachon, Ann Casey, and Darling Dagmar moved into other regions where Ellison had less control and negotiated their own payouts with promoters.

Both Judy Martin and Leilani Kai told in later interviews that Moolah would collect the women wrestlers&#x27; pay from promoters and, after taking out her own pay, would only give the girls half of the money they were owed (keeping half of their pay for herself, plus her own pay) and telling them that was all the promoter gave her to give them. Martin stated that shortly before Ellison left the WWF in 1988 (shortly after falling out with Martin and Kai due to Ellison no longer receiving their booking fees), she sabotaged the duo while they were touring Japan. Martin stated that Ellison contacted Japanese promoters and informed them that the Jumping Bomb Angels were supposed to drop the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship to The Glamour Girls before Martin and Kai returned to the United States. This was contrary to the booking decision made by Pat Patterson before the Japanese tour began. Unable to reach Patterson by telephone, Kai and Martin agreed to win the titles from the Angels since Ellison had already misinformed the Japanese promoters. Martin stated that upon returning to the United States, Patterson was angry with them and confirmed that nobody within the WWF made the decision for the title change and that due to her long-standing relationship with the company, the WWF refused to listen to their explanation of Ellison&#x27;s deceit. Shortly thereafter, the WWF phased out the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship. In a later shoot interview, Leilani Kai told that had things gone as the WWF originally planned, The Glamour Girls would have had a title match against the Jumping Bomb Angels at WrestleMania IV and that Ellison&#x27;s actions had cost the four girls what would have been ultimately their biggest ever payday.

Women that chose to continue allowing Ellison to work as their booker were kept under tight control. Velvet McIntyre was forced to compete against Ellison (whom McIntyre stated she didn&#x27;t care for) at WrestleMania 2 instead of competing during an all-women tour of Kuwait with a group of Ellison&#x27;s other female wrestlers. Their WrestleMania 2 match lasted less than two minutes with the referee ignoring McIntyre&#x27;s leg being on the ropes while she was being pinned. Women that did not agree to Ellison&#x27;s booking fees faced limited options. Rhonda Sing stated that Ellison contacted her and offered to let her wrestle Richter in a couple of pay-per-view matches for the WWF in 1985, but demanded she receive half of Sing&#x27;s pay check; a stipulation Sing was unwilling to accept. Penny Banner stated that her retirement was due in large part to Ellison refusing to allow any of her female wrestlers to accept bookings against Banner, which severely limited the number of bookings that Banner was offered by promoters.

==Legacy==
Moolah’s career spanned over 5 decades. She was overall an eight-time world champion and is still widely recognized as the longest reigning champion of any wrestler in the wrestling business, holding the NWA/WWE Women&#x27;s Champion for 10,775 days. Her last reign made history when she became the oldest female in WWE history to win the WWE Women&#x27;s Champion at the age of 76. She was considered as an important figure and the forefront of women&#x27;s wrestling from 1960s-1980s. Some of her notable trainees were Wendi Richter, Sherri Martel, Leilani Kai, Mad Maxine and Donna Christianello. On July 1, 1972, she and Vicki Williams were the first women to wrestle in Madison Square Garden. For her impact, longevity and contributions, she became the first female inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1995 and eventually Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003.

At the time of her death, Kevin Eck wrote in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;: &quot;The Fabulous Moolah didn&#x27;t just dominate women&#x27;s wrestling for parts of four decades, she was women&#x27;s wrestling. Moolah ... is unquestionably the most influential and famous female wrestler in history.&quot; &quot;The Post and Courier&quot; columnist Mike Mooneyham described her as &quot;one of the greatest female performers to ever step into a professional wrestling ring and the most powerful woman outside the squared circle.&quot; She was the only female performer to be included in WWE&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Superstars of All Time&quot; DVD, placing 27th on the list. WWE describe her: “Moolah was recognized as the true pioneer and biggest legend in the history of women&#x27;s wrestling.” In 2016, after allegations against Moolah had become more prevalent, Luke Winkie of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed Moolah as the 69th greatest wrestler of all time because of her lengthy title reign but wrote that he &quot;didn&#x27;t feel great about it&quot;. Her house was located at Moolah Drive in South Carolina, a street named after her.

Dave Meltzer described that women&#x27;s wrestling &quot;went way way down&quot; under Moolah&#x27;s &quot;tutelage&quot;, but he also said he did not know if it was her fault. Meltzer said that although women &quot;used to headline and they were successful&quot;, &quot;during the period Moolah controlled women&#x27;s wrestling, the popularity and product didn&#x27;t evolve.&quot; However, Meltzer noted that Moolah herself &quot;stood the test of time&quot; to remain culturally relevant long after the Japanese female wrestlers of the 1980s (more popular at that time) had faded from relevance.

In March 2018, WWE announced &quot;The Fabulous Moolah Memorial Battle Royal&quot;, a battle royal for the female wrestlers of the company scheduled for WrestleMania 34 named in honor of Moolah. The decision to hold a battle royal in honor of Moolah drew controversy after the allegations of exploitation against Moolah resurfaced. Two days after the announcement, WWE renamed the match &quot;WrestleMania Women&#x27;s Battle Royal&quot;, removing Moolah&#x27;s name from the event. A 2019 episode of &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; broadcast on Viceland examined the allegations against her in the aftermath of the battle royal name controversy. The episode repeated many of the allegations against her but also featured comments from the son of Sweet Georgia Brown and wrestlers Selina Majors and Beverly Shade, who defended her. &quot;If I choose not to like her because of what she did to me, that&#x27;s fine,&quot; Princess Victoria stated. &quot;But Moolah needs to be remembered. She was an icon in this business. You can&#x27;t take away her history because she was an asshole!&quot;

== Other media ==
An animated version of Moolah was included on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;. In addition, she appeared in one of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s music videos, &quot;The Goonies &#x27;R&#x27; Good Enough&quot;. An illness in the mid-1970s meant Ellison had to pull out of the Bill Cosby movie &quot;Mother, Jugs &amp; Speed&quot;, which had a role written specifically for her. In 2002, Moolah wrote her autobiography, &quot;The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle&quot;. The book has been criticized for keeping kayfabe (the stance that wrestling storylines are real) and did not reveal a lot about her time controlling women&#x27;s wrestling. Defending herself against these claims, Ellison retorted it was hard to fit all of her almost five decade career into one book.

Moolah and Young, along with several other female wrestlers, starred in the 2004 film &quot;Lipstick and Dynamite&quot;, a documentary about the female wrestlers from the 1950s era. They also appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; promoting the film.

== Personal life ==
Ellison&#x27;s first husband was Walter Carroll, who became the father of her daughter Mary. Mary wrestled briefly but decided against pursuing the profession. Ellison had six grandchildren. Ellison and Carroll divorced shortly after their daughter&#x27;s birth. Later, Ellison married wrestler Johnny Long. Marital conflicts developed when Long wanted Ellison to be a housewife instead of a career woman. In addition, Ellison accused Long of being a &quot;womanizer&quot;. Ellison and Long divorced. Ellison also says that she dated country singer Hank Williams for four months in 1952. According to Ellison, Williams proposed to her, but Williams&#x27;s drinking and heroin abuse forced the couple to go separate ways. She further claimed that he wanted Ellison to quit her wrestling career, which she did not want to do. Two months after the breakup, Williams died due to an overdose.

Later, Ellison met a wrestler named Buddy Lee, whom she regarded as the &quot;love of her life.&quot; They were eventually married, and after divorcing in 1970 after nine years of marriage, they remained friends until Lee&#x27;s death in 1999. The divorce was attributed to Lee&#x27;s affair with Rita Cortez, one of the wrestlers the duo was training. In the early 1980s, Ellison opened Moolah&#x27;s Hideaway, a bar and grill which was operated by her daughter Mary and frequented by André the Giant.

Beginning in 1991, Ellison lived with Mae Young in a house in Columbia, South Carolina. Her estate was located on a road named Moolah Drive. A midget professional wrestler named Katie Glass also lived with Moolah for over forty years. Another wrestler, Donna Christanello, also lived with Ellison on-and-off for forty years, ending in May 1999.

During her return to the ring in 1999, Ellison began experiencing occasional dizziness, and as a result, her doctor requested that she begin to wear a heart monitor. A few days later, Ellison was admitted to the hospital for what turned out to be two clogged arteries and viral pneumonia. She stayed at the intensive-care unit of the hospital for 24 days, during which she was unconscious for fifteen days. After leaving the hospital, she again slipped into unconsciousness in the bathroom at her home, crushing several vertebrae. She underwent successful back surgery in mid-December.

===Death===
Ellison died on November 2, 2007, at the age of 84 in Columbia, South Carolina. According to her daughter Mary, the possible cause of death was a heart attack or blood clot related to a recent shoulder replacement surgery. Ellison is buried in a grave plot at Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia, South Carolina.

<text>Messier 60 or M60, also known as NGC 4649, is an elliptical galaxy approximately 57 million light-years away in the equatorial constellation of Virgo. Together with NGC 4647, it forms a pair known as Arp 116. Messier 60 and nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 59 were discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779, observing a comet in the same part of the sky. Charles Messier added both to his catalogue about three days after this.

== Characteristics ==

This is an elliptical galaxy of type E (E1.5), although some sources class it as S0 – a lenticular galaxy. An E2 class indicates a flattening of 20%, which has a nearly round appearance. The isophotes of the galaxy are boxy in shape, rather than simple ellipses. The mass-to-light ratio is a near constant 9.5 in the V (visual) band of the UBV system. The galaxy has an effective radius of (translating, at its distance, to about 10 kpc), with an estimated mass of ~1012  within a threefold volume, of which nearly half is dark matter. The mass estimated from X-ray emission is within 5 effective radii.

=== Supermassive black hole ===

At the center of M60 is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of  billion solar masses, one of the largest ever found. It is currently inactive. X-ray emission from the galaxy shows a cavity created by jets emitted by the hole during past active periods, which correspond to weak radio lobes. The power needed to generate these features is in the range (ergs per second).

== Supernovae ==
In 2004, supernova &quot;SN 2004W&quot; was observed in Messier 60. It was a type Ia supernova found west and south of the nucleus.

== Environment ==
M60 is the third-brightest giant elliptical galaxy of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and is the dominant member of a subcluster of four galaxies, the M60 group, which is the closest-known isolated compact group of galaxies. It has several satellite galaxies, one of them being the ultracompact dwarf galaxy M60-UCD1, discovered in 2013. The motion of M60 through the intercluster medium is resulting in ram-pressure stripping of gas from the galaxy&#x27;s outer halo, beyond a radius of 12 kpc.

NGC 4647 appears approximately 2.5 from Messier 60; the optical disks of the two galaxies overlap. Although this overlap suggests that the galaxies are interacting, photographic images of the two galaxies do not reveal any evidence for gravitational interactions between the two galaxies as would be suggested if the two galaxies were physically close to each other. This suggests that the galaxies are at different distances and are only weakly interacting if at all. However, studies with the Hubble Space Telescope show indications that a tidal interaction may have just begun.

== Recession speed and distance estimations ==
Messier 60 was the fastest-moving galaxy included in Edwin Hubble&#x27;s landmark 1929 paper concerning the relationship between recession speed and distance. He used a value of 1090 km/s for the recession speed, 1.8% less than the more recent value of about 1110 km/s (based on a redshift of 0.003726). But he estimated the distance of this galaxy as well as of the three nebulas of the Virgo Cluster which he included (Messier 85, 49, and 87), to be only two million parsecs, rather than the accepted value today of around 16 million parsecs. These errors in distance led him to propose a Hubble constant of 500 km/s/Mpc, whereas the present estimate is around 70 km/s/Mpc.

<doc id="964077" wikidata="Q685149" url="?curid=964077" title="Lamar Smith">
<text>Lamar Seeligson Smith (born November 19, 1947) is an American politician and lobbyist who served in the United States House of Representatives for for 16 terms, a district including most of the wealthier sections of San Antonio and Austin, as well as some of the Texas Hill Country. He is a member of the Republican Party. He sponsored the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protecting Children From Internet Pornographers Act (PCIP). He also co-sponsored the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act.

As the head of the House Science Committee, Smith has been criticized for his denial of, and promotion of conspiracy theories about, climate change and for receiving funding from oil and gas companies. He is a former contributor to Breitbart News, a website known for publishing dubious claims about climate change.

In November 2017, Smith announced that he would retire from Congress at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in 2018. In 2021, Smith registered as a lobbyist for the surveillance firm HawkEye 360 on behalf of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. In 2022, he officially registered as a foreign agent.

== Early life, education, and legal career ==
Smith attended a private high school, then called Texas Military Institute, now known as TMI — The Episcopal School of Texas, and graduated in 1965. He then earned a B.A. in American Studies from Yale University (1969) and a J.D. from Southern Methodist University (1975).

In 1969, Smith was hired as a management intern by the Small Business Administration in Washington, D.C. He was a business and financial writer for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; (1970–1972), was admitted to the Texas bar in 1975, and went into private practice in San Antonio with the firm of Maebius and Duncan, Inc.

== State politics ==
In 1978, he was elected chairman of the Republican Party of Bexar County. In 1980, Smith was elected to the Texas House of Representatives representing Bexar County, the 57th District. He served on the Energy Resources Committee and the Fire Ants Select Committee. In 1982, he was elected to the 3rd Precinct of the Bexar County Commissioners Court and served from 1983 to 1986.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Elections ===
==== 1986 ====
In 1986, four-term incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman Tom Loeffler of Texas&#x27;s 21st congressional district decided to retire to run for governor of Texas. Smith led a crowded six-way primary with 31% of the vote and then defeated Van Archer in the run-off election 54–46%. He won the general election with 61% of the vote.

==== 1988–2002 ====
During this time period, he never won re-election with less than 72% of the vote.

==== 2004 ====
Smith&#x27;s district was significantly altered in the 2003 Texas redistricting. While he lost most of the Hill Country to the 23rd District, he picked up a significant portion of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas, a traditional bastion of liberalism. Smith won re-election with 62% of the vote, Smith&#x27;s lowest winning percentage since his initial run in 1986.

==== 2006 ====
In 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States threw out the 23rd District in &quot;League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry&quot; on the grounds that it violated the rights of Latino voters. The 23rd is the largest district in the nation (not counting the at-large districts), stretching across 800 road miles from El Paso to San Antonio. Due to its size, nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn. Smith regained most of the Hill Country, but kept a large portion of his share of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas.

In November 2006 the Texas Legislative Council found that nearly two-thirds of voters in District 21 cast ballots for statewide Republican candidates in 2004. In the November 2006 open election, Smith faced six candidates. He defeated Democrats John Courage and Gene Kelly 60–24–9%. This was Smith&#x27;s lowest winning percentage of his career.

==== 2008 ====
He only faced one candidate, Libertarian nominee James Arthur Strohm, and defeated him with 80% of the vote.

==== 2010 ====
He faced two candidates, Democratic nominee Lainey Melnick and Libertarian nominee James Arthur Strohm, and won with 69% of the vote.

==== 2012 ====
Smith faced five challengers in the 2012 general election on November 6, 2012: Candace Duval (Dem), John-Henry Liberty (Lib), Fidel Castillo (Grn), Bill Stout (Grn), and Carlos Pena (Ind). He won the race with 63% of the vote.

==== 2014 ====
Smith won re-nomination to fifteenth House term in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He received 40,262 votes (60.4 percent). His runner-up was Matt McCall (born c. 1963) of San Antonio, with 22,596 votes (33.9 percent). Michael J. Smith polled the remaining 3,772 votes (5.7 percent).

==== 2016 ====
Smith won re-nomination to a sixteenth term in the House in the Republican primary held on March 1. He received 69,872 votes (60.1 percent). Running against him once more was Matt McCall, who drew 33,597 votes (28.9 percent). McCall polled 11,000 more votes than he did in 2014, but his percent went down because of higher turnout. Two other candidates held the remaining 11 percent of the ballots cast.

Smith faced the Democrat Tom Wakely (born c. 1953) of San Antonio in the November 8 general election. Smith (Republican) won with 57.0%; Tom Wakely (Democratic) got 36.5%; Mark Loewe (Libertarian) got 4.1%; and Antonio Diaz (Green) got 2.4%.

=== Tenure ===
==== Abortion ====
Smith has consistently supported restrictions on abortion. In 2009, Smith voted to prohibit federally funded abortions. In 2006, Smith voted for the Abortion Pain Bill, which would &quot;ensure that women seeking an abortion are fully informed regarding the pain experienced by their unborn child&quot;, and the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which would &quot;prohibit taking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the involvement of parents in abortion decisions&quot;. In 2008, the National Right to Life Committee, an anti-abortion advocacy group, gave Representative Smith a rating of 100 on a point system in which points were assigned for actions in support of legislation they described as pro-life.

==== Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) ====
On April 23, 2006 CNET reported that Smith was introducing a bill that &quot;would expand the DMCA&#x27;s restrictions on software that can bypass copy protections and grant federal police more wiretapping and enforcement powers&quot;. The move sparked a negative response among technology enthusiasts in opposition to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

==== Marijuana ====
Smith is a strong opponent of marijuana legalization; as chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Lamar blocked committee consideration of the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011, a bill to repeal the federal prohibition on marijuana and allow the states to set laws on cultivation, sales, use, and taxation. Smith stated that &quot;marijuana use and distribution – has a high potential for abuse&quot; and that &quot;decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to millions more Americans becoming addicted to drugs and greater profits for drug cartels who fund violence along the U.S.-Mexico border.&quot;

==== Donations ====
In 2011 Smith had received $37,250 in campaign contributions from the Beer, Wine and Liquor Lobby, and $65,800 total between 2009 and 2011. He received more than $133,000 from the Content Industry, including Industry groups and individual companies through mid-2011. Another $60,000 was donated by these companies in the 2012 Election Cycle. Maplight.org listed the Beer, Wine, and Liquor Lobby as third among Smith&#x27;s top ten campaign contributors, and Content Industry as #1.

==== Leahy–Smith America Invents Act ====
In 2011 Smith co-sponsored the Leahy–Smith America Invents Act, a bill that made significant changes to the U.S. patent system. The bill was signed into law by President Barack Obama on September 16, 2011. The law will switch U.S. rights to a patent from the present first-to-invent system to a first inventor-to-file system for patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013.

==== Space Launch Liability Indemnification Extension Act ====
On November 20, 2013, Smith introduced the Space Launch Liability Indemnification Extension Act (H.R. 3547; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend until December 31, 2014, the current limitation on liability of commercial space launch companies. Under the current system, the space launch company is liable for any damages up to $500 million, after which the U.S. Government will pay the damages in the range of $500 million to $2.7 billion. Above $2.7 billion, the company is again responsible.

==== STEM Education Act of 2014 ====
On July 8, 2014, Smith introduced the STEM Education Act of 2014 (H.R. 5031; 113th Congress), a bill that would add computer science to the definition of STEM fields used by the United States federal government in determining grants and education funding. Smith said that &quot;we have to capture and hold the desire of our nation&#x27;s youth to study science and engineering so they will want to pursue these careers. A health and viable STEM workforce, literate in all STEM subjects including computer science, is critical to American industries. We must work to ensure that students continue to go into these fields so that their ideas can lead to a more innovative and prosperous America.&quot;

==== Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) ====
On October 26, 2011, Smith introduced the Stop Online Piracy Act (H.R. 3261), also known as SOPA. The bill sought to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to fight online trafficking in copyrighted intellectual property and counterfeit goods. SOPA faced significant opposition from internet freedom advocacy groups and web companies, and on January 15, 2012, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor cancelled a planned vote on the bill.

==== Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers (PCIP) Act ====
On May 25, 2011, Smith introduced the Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011, which sought to change sentencing rules and mandated that ISPs keep logs of customer data (such as name, IP addresses, credit card numbers, and bank account numbers) for at least a year. Representative Zoe Lofgren, (D-Calif.) and Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) criticized PCIP. Lofgren said a better name would be &quot;Keep Every Americans&#x27; Digital Data for Submission to the Federal Government Without a Warrant Act&quot;. Conyers said the bill would allow use of the information for purposes entirely unrelated to fighting child pornography.

==== Taxes ====
Smith is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge.

==== Climate change ====
Smith has unequivocally stated that he believes the climate is changing, and that humans play a role in climate change. However, he questions the extent of the impact and accuses scientists of promoting a personal agenda unsupported by evidence. Smith has made a number of false and misleading claims about climate change.

As of 2015, Smith has received more than $600,000 from the fossil fuel industry during his career in Congress. In 2014, Smith got more money from fossil fuels than he did from any other industry. Smith publicly denies global warming. Under his leadership, the House Science committee has held hearings that feature the views of climate change deniers, subpoenaed the records and communications of scientists who published papers that Smith disapproved of, and attempted to cut NASA&#x27;s earth sciences budget. He has been criticized for conducting &quot;witch hunts&quot; against climate scientists. In his capacity as chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, Smith issued more subpoenas in his first three years than the committee had for its entire 54-year history. In a June 2016 response letter to the Union of Concerned Scientists, Mr. Smith cited the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s as valid legal precedent for his investigation.

On December 1, 2016, as chair on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, he tweeted out on behalf of that committee a Breitbart News article denying climate change.

==== World Health Organization ====
In February 2018, Smith criticized the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO) cancer research program for its finding that glyphosate, the active component in the herbicide Roundup, is probably carcinogen.

==== Travel ban executive order ====
Smith supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 Executive Order 13769 to ban citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, saying &quot;I appreciate President Trump&#x27;s effort to protect innocent Americans from those who might commit terrorist acts. We ought to take every reasonable step possible to protect the American people. Those from terrorist sponsoring countries should not be admitted until they can be properly vetted by our national security agencies.&quot;

=== Committee assignments ===
Smith served as chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology for the 113th Congress, having replaced Ralph Hall. Smith has previously served on the Committee on Homeland Security, Committee on the Judiciary (Chairman), the Republican Study Committee, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus and the Tea Party Caucus.

On January 30, 2015, Law360 reported that Smith has sent letters to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and to the chief technology officer at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, asking for an explanation of media claims of HealthCare.gov sharing private data supplied by subscribers with third-parties such as Google, Twitter, and YouTube.

Smith is a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, the Congressional Constitution Caucus and the Congressional Western Caucus.

== Personal life ==
In 1992, he married Elizabeth Lynn Schaefer, a Christian Science practitioner and teacher, as was his first wife, Jane Shoults, before her death in 1991. They have two children, Nell Seeligson (born 1976) and Tobin Wells (born 1979), from his previous marriage.

<text>Messier 62 or M62, also known as NGC 6266 or the Flickering Globular Cluster, is a globular cluster of stars in the south of the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus. It was discovered in 1771 by Charles Messier, then added to his catalogue eight years later.

M62 is about from Earth and from the Galactic Center. It is among the ten most massive and luminous globular clusters in the Milky Way, showing an integrated absolute magnitude of −9.18. It has an estimated mass of and a mass-to-light ratio of in the core visible light band, the V band. It has a projected ellipticity of 0.01, meaning it is essentially spherical. The density profile of its member stars suggests it has not yet undergone core collapse. It has a core radius of , a half-mass radius of , and a half-light radius of . The stellar density at the core is per cubic parsec. It has a tidal radius of .

The cluster shows at least two distinct populations of stars, which most likely represent two separate episodes of star formation. Of the main sequence stars in the cluster, are from the first generation and from the second. The second is enriched by elements released by the first. In particular, abundances of helium, carbon, magnesium, aluminium, and sodium differ between these two.

Indications are this is an Oosterhoff type I, or &quot;metal-rich&quot; system. A 2010 study identified 245 variable stars in the cluster&#x27;s field, of which 209 are RR Lyrae variables, four are Type II Cepheids, 25 are long period variables, and one is an eclipsing binary. The cluster may prove to be the galaxy&#x27;s richest in terms of RR Lyrae variables. It has ten binary millisecond pulsars, including one (M62B) that is displaying eclipsing behavior from gas streaming off its companion, and one (M62H) with an orbiting exoplanet about three times the mass of Jupiter. There are multiple X-ray sources, including 50 within the half-mass radius. 47 blue straggler candidates have been identified, formed from the merger of two stars in a binary system, and these are preferentially concentrated near the core region.

It is hypothesized that this cluster may be host to an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) – it is considered well-suited for searching for such an object. A brief study, before 2013, of the proper motion of stars within of the core did not require an IMBH to explain. However, simulations can not rule out one with a mass of a few thousand in M62&#x27;s core. For example, based upon radial velocity measurements within an arcsecond of the core, Kiselev et al. (2008) made the claim of an IMBH in M15, likewise with mass of .

<text>WXDU (88.7 FM) is a non-commercial campus radio station broadcasting a college radio format. Licensed to Durham, North Carolina, United States, the station serves the Research Triangle area. The station is owned by Duke University.

==History==
===1950 – WDBS===
Student radio at Duke began in the late 1940s when the Undergraduate Men&#x27;s Student Government Association formed a &quot;radio council&quot; to look into the possibility of establishing a campus radio station. Their efforts produced WDBS (Duke Broadcasting System), which signed on the air in 1950 on AM frequency 560.

WDBS&#x27;s offices and studios were located in the basement of the Gray building. It used carrier current AM in order to broadcast to the university&#x27;s dorms and union building. With carrier current, wires are placed in these buildings, and any radio plugged into an outlet in one of the buildings could receive AM 560. In the 1950s, this was the state-of-the-art way to broadcast.

The music shows featured hits of the day, as well as classical and jazz shows. The WDBS news and sports departments were nationally acclaimed, winning &quot;Best College News Department&quot; awards from 1956 to 1959. David Hartman, former host of &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, got his start at WDBS.
WDBS continued its broadcasting during the student activism of the 1960s, with its music programming changing to reflect students&#x27; changing tastes. WDBS was the first station to initiate a program exchange with Radio Moscow. Each week, the two stations would air the other&#x27;s show, with complete translation of news and editorial comments. This program brought with it a lot of interest from the CIA, and it was eventually stopped.

While the WDBS sports staff was covering national championship teams, the news department was busy reporting on-campus events. The years 1967-69 were tumultuous ones on the Duke campus, and the WDBS news team was always there with live news coverage, even when the main quad was tear-gassed. In 1969, when student protesters took over both the Allen Building and the President&#x27;s home, WDBS reporters were inside sending out the only live reports from the scene. WDBS also sent a reporter to the Republican and Democratic conventions in 1968; live reports were broadcast when Chicago police clashed with young demonstrators outside the Democratic convention hall.

FM radio had begun to achieve popularity in the late 1960s, as students were attracted to the advantages of stereo radio. The management of WDBS did not want to be left behind with its now-outdated carrier current system. In 1969, WDBS managers and University officials began the search for an FM frequency. With a $200,000 loan from the university, WDBS purchased the frequency 107.1 from the near-bankrupt WSRC. WDBS-FM signed on as Duke&#x27;s new radio station in May 1971. They moved the studios into the once-condemned Bivins Building on East Campus.

In order to repay the loan, WDBS intended to operate as a commercial, profit-making station, while maintaining a student staff. However, the realities of commercial radio soon necessitated an entirely professional staff, as former student volunteers stayed on to become employees. By 1973, there was only a handful of student station members left, and WDBS was, for all practical purposes, no longer the Duke station. 

In the early years, WDBS attracted a substantial following in the Triangle. It was one of the first free-form album rock stations in the Southeast, and its reputation grew as it expanded its programming to include blocks of classical and jazz music every day. The early WDBS certainly defined &quot;alternative&quot; radio.

WDBS was not without a major problem, though. The former students now managing it had no previous business experience, and in no time, WDBS was losing money by the truckload. The university continued to loan the station money just to meet its operating expenses. In the meantime, Duke students were without their own radio station. In the fall of 1974, with the help of WDBS and the university, a group of students resurrected the antiquated carrier current system, and turned an old classroom next door to the Bivins building into their studios. WDUR signed on the air at 1600 AM.

=== 1974 – WDUR/WDUK ===
WDUR received constant trouble from the old transmission system. The station&#x27;s small budget prevented them from buying any new equipment, and the old system had been allowed to deteriorate. Only a few dorms could receive an acceptable signal. Station engineers spent much of their time repairing the old transmission wires, only to have them go out again before too long.

WDUR&#x27;s fortunes brightened during the 1975–76 school year when the station officially became a student activity, and began receiving funding from the Associated Students of Duke University (ASDU). Reception was improved, and the station set up a direct line to the CI. The station grew, and developed into a tight Top 40 format. &quot;Duke Radio 16&quot;, as it was called, then added progressive rock and jazz shows, and a juke box named &quot;Otto&quot;, which automatically played singles at night, keeping the station on the air 24 hours a day. Otto would insert taped messages to identify the station at regular intervals. This sort of operation was legal because of WDUR&#x27;s carrier-current status; a regular broadcast station could not operate automatically under the law.

During the summer of 1977, a local commercial station petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the call letters WDUR. Since a carrier current station is unlicensed, and actually makes up its own call letters, the FCC granted the commercial station&#x27;s request. The Duke station became WDUK.

While all this was happening, WDBS continued to pile up a huge debt, losing much favor with the administration in the process. By 1978, this debt was said to be over $400,000.

Progressive rock grew to make up half of WDUK&#x27;s programming, but the continued weak reception prompted management to look into alternatives. The decision was made to research the possibility of going FM. 1980 ended with two significant announcements: an open frequency had been found for an FM station (88.7), and WDBS was moving off-campus, allowing WDUK to move into larger studios.

Getting an FM station on the air is no trivial task: among other things, WDUK would need a large amount of funding, university support, an FCC license, and a place to put the transmitter. The decision on where to put the transmitter was pivotal. Due to nearby stations of 88.5 and 88.9, a new station on 88.7 would not be able to operate at a very high power level. If the transmitter were put on campus, it could operate at a couple of hundred watts of power, and could reach almost a hundred square miles. If the transmitter were put at a location in the Duke Forest in Hillsborough, North Carolina, it could operate at over one thousand watts, and could reach over three hundred square miles. The latter option would be a gamble, however, as studies showed that reception on campus could turn out to be marginal.

Enticed by the offer of a larger coverage area, the management decided to put the transmitter in Hillsborough, and an FCC application was prepared (a lengthy process). WDUK continued to operate, and by this time progressive rock had entirely taken over the station&#x27;s programming. Disaster was to strike, though; in January 1982, just as WDBS had finally left and WDUK was getting ready to begin building its new studios, the 32-year-old transmission system died. The entire spring semester of 1982 was spent repairing the old transmitters.

=== 1983 – WXDU ===
WDUK was finally back on the air by the 82–83 school year. Situated in its new studios, the station fine-tuned its progressive format in anticipation of going FM. As it turned out, the FCC acted surprisingly quickly on the university&#x27;s application for an FM station, and on December 1, 1982, the university was notified that its request had been approved. Since a commercial station with the call letters WDUK already existed, the name of the station was changed to WXDU.

With a resounding 98% vote, the student body approved a referendum allocating $76,000 of their activities fee for the construction of the new FM station. Vice President William Griffith, one of the original members of the student &quot;radio council&quot; that founded WDBS in the late 1940s, provided additional funding. As construction progressed, WDUK continued to get attention by being the only station in the country to provide live coverage of the Duke-Indiana NCAA soccer championship game.

In October 1983, with the song &quot;Station to Station&quot; by David Bowie, WXDU signed on the air, and a new era of Duke radio had begun.

As it turned out, coverage on campus was indeed marginal. In 1984, the station applied for and received FCC approval of an antenna change that would bring the station&#x27;s Effective Radiated Power up to a level of 1600 watts. This improved coverage, but WXDU was still not providing adequate service to campus. During the 1986–87 school year, the management researched the possibility of putting an FM broadcast translator station on campus. A translator would pick up the station&#x27;s main signal on 88.7, shift it to another frequency, and re-transmit it at a low power level. But because a translator could be located on the campus, this power level would be enough to provide excellent service to those who could not receive the station at all.

The frequency 90.7 was chosen for the translator, and an FCC application was submitted in June 1987. The application for 1-watt translator W214AF (90.7 MHz), transmitting from the West Campus bell tower, was granted in September 1987, and the translator went on the air at the start of 1988. When North Carolina Central University received a license to build WNCU on 90.7 FM in the early 1990s, W214AF shifted to 103.5 as W278AB. It discontinued licensed operation in the early 2000s.

Over the next five years, WXDU developed a national reputation for the progressive music it played, and the growing local music scene it promoted.

During the 1992–93 school year, WXDU left the supervision of the student government and joined the Duke University Union. The move has allowed the station to grow in new and exciting ways. WXDU can now, for instance, sponsor concerts on campus at the Coffeehouse, and pool resources with other union groups such as Cable 13 and Major Attractions. The move also brought much-needed financial support to WXDU, and has allowed the station to refurbish the dilapidated studio equipment and furniture.

In the years since then WXDU has continued to flourish with the support of the union. The station has maintained a national reputation for great music, and in the late 1990s/early 2000s (decade), the station&#x27;s Country/Bluegrass/Folk programming has been noted on both the local and national levels.

During Hurricane Fran in 1996, the WXDU tower collapsed and the station spent the next 2 years virtually off the air with a very limited signal. Through a series of benefits and through the generosity of the Duke Union, WXDU was able to raise a new tower, just east of highway 86, south of I-85, with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2150 watts, at a height above average terrain of 77 meters, or 253 feet. The signal is also directional (see FCC engineering data below), with full power toward the northeast, and lower powers in other directions. It is lowest toward the southeast (between Durham and Chapel Hill), where the null is 1/3 the full power value, or about 716 watts.

In 2018, WXDU moved to new, custom-designed studio space in the new Rubenstein Arts Center.

== Management ==
WXDU is run and managed by an executive board of members who oversee all aspects of the radio station. Each year, WXDU holds elections and the DJ community has a say in electing their representatives. The roles within the executive board entail the General Manager, a position that is only eligible to students, Programming Director, Music Director, Non Musical Programming Director, Promotions Director, and DJ representative.

== Specialty shows ==
WXDU airs a variety of specialty shows that are managed by specific DJs. These shows are then open to all WXDU DJs, old and new, every week as an opportunity to learn about different types of music genres.

<text>USS &quot;Hull&quot; (DD-7) was a &quot;Hopkins&quot;-class destroyer, which was a sub-class of the , in the United States Navy, the second ship named for Commodore Isaac Hull.

==Construction==
&quot;Hull&quot; was launched by Harlan &amp; Hollingsworth of Wilmington, Delaware, on 21 June 1902; sponsored by Miss Mabel Hull, a descendant of Commodore Hull; and commissioned on 20 May 1903, Lieutenant Samuel Robison in command.

==Pre-World War I==
During her first two years of service, &quot;Hull&quot; engaged in patrol and training maneuvers off Newport and in Chesapeake Bay. After a cruise to the Caribbean January–April 1905, she returned to League Island, Pennsylvania, where she decommissioned on 30 September.

&quot;Hull&quot; recommissioned on 14 November 1906 at Philadelphia, and took part in winter exercises with fleet units in Cuban waters. After operations off Newport, the ship returned to Norfolk in October 1907 to prepare for the voyage of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;. &quot;Hull&quot; sailed as an escort vessel on 2 December and after stopping at many South American and Central American ports on the voyage around South America with the great battleships, arrived San Diego on 28 April 1907. &quot;Hull&quot; was detached on the west coast, and the Great White Fleet continued on its cruise, showing the flag around the world. The destroyer remained in the vicinity of San Francisco until departing on 24 August 1908 for a cruise to the South Pacific. She took part in various exercises in Hawaiian and Samoan waters before returning to San Diego in November.

==World War I==
&quot;Hull&quot; spent the years before World War I on patrol and training exercises off the California coast. She decommissioned on 30 October 1912 and joined the Reserve Torpedo Division at Mare Island, with which she made occasional training cruises to California ports. When America entered the war in April 1917, &quot;Hull&quot; was being refitted at Mare Island. She sailed with other destroyers for the Panama Canal Zone on 25 April and for the next three months was engaged in defensive patrol off the western approaches to that vital waterway. She sailed to Norfolk on 26 July for escort and patrol duty along the East Coast. In the months that followed, &quot;Hull&quot; escorted ships to Bermuda and engaged in training maneuvers with other ships of the fleet as well. In June 1918, she broke up an attack by German submarine &quot;U-151&quot; on a merchant ship, and often rescued sailors from sinking ships. She continued this vital ocean patrol duty until the end of the war.

&quot;Hull&quot; arrived at Philadelphia on 29 January 1919, and decommissioned on 7 July. She was sold on 5 January 1921 to Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company of Philadelphia.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant Samuel Robison (20 May 1903 – 23 June 1904) (Later Rear Admiral) 
* Lieutenant Thomas C. Hart (14 November 1906 – 14 June 1907) (Later Admiral)
* Lieutenant commander Robert Stevenson Haggart (December 1917-7 July 1919) (Later Commodore)

<text>Messier 63 or M63, also known as NGC 5055 or the seldom-used Sunflower Galaxy, is a spiral galaxy in the northern constellation of Canes Venatici with approximately 400 billion stars. M63 was first discovered by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain, then later verified by his colleague Charles Messier on 14 June 1779. The galaxy became listed as object 63 in the Messier Catalogue. In the mid-19th century, Anglo-Irish astronomer Lord Rosse identified spiral structures within the galaxy, making this one of the first galaxies in which such structure was identified.

The shape or morphology of this galaxy has a classification of SAbc, indicating a spiral form with no central bar feature (SA) and moderate to loosely wound arms (bc). There is a general lack of large-scale continuous spiral structure in visible light, so it is considered a &quot;flocculent galaxy&quot;. However, when observed in the near infrared, a symmetric, two-arm structure is seen. Each arm wraps 150° around the galaxy and extends out to from the nucleus.

M63 is a weakly active galaxy with a LINER nucleus – short for &#x27;low-ionization nuclear emission-line region&#x27;. This displays as an unresolved source at the galactic nucleus that is cloaked in a diffuse emission. The latter is extended along a position angle of 110° relative to the north celestial pole, and both soft X-rays and hydrogen (H-alpha) emission can be observed coming from along nearly the same direction. The existence of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the nucleus is uncertain; if it does exist, then the mass is estimated as , or around 850 million times the mass of the Sun.

Radio observations at the 21-cm hydrogen line show the gaseous disk of M63 extends outward to a radius of , well past the bright optical disk. This gas shows a symmetrical form that is warped in a pronounced manner, starting at a radius of . The form suggests a dark matter halo that is offset with respect to the inner region. The reason for the warp is unclear, but the position angle points toward the smaller companion galaxy, UGC 8313.

The distance to M63, based upon the luminosity-distance measurement is . The radial velocity relative to the Local Group yields an estimate of . Estimates based on the Tully–Fisher relation range over . The tip of the red-giant branch technique gives a distance of . M63 is part of the M51 Group, a group of galaxies that also includes M51 (the &#x27;Whirlpool Galaxy&#x27;).

One supernova has been observed in M63: (typeIa, mag. 11.8) was discovered by Glenn Jolly on 24 May 1971, and was discovered independently by Roger Clark on 29 May 1971. It reached peak light around 26 May. While the spectrum was consistent with a supernova of type I, the spectroscopic behavior appeared anomalous.

<doc id="964121" wikidata="Q1674465" url="?curid=964121" title="Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania politician)">
<text>Joseph Russell Pitts (born October 10, 1939) is a former American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1997 to 2017. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district was based in Lancaster and Reading and included much of the Amish country. It also included the far southwestern suburbs of Philadelphia in Chester County.

In December 2015, Congressman Pitts announced he would not run for reelection in 2016.

==Early life and education==
Pitts was born in Lexington, Kentucky and graduated from Asbury College. Pitts served five and a half years in the United States Air Force, with three tours in Vietnam. Initially commissioned as a second lieutenant, he was promoted to captain by the time he left the service. He graduated second in his class from Navigator School, after which he was trained as an electronic warfare officer. As an EW officer, he served on B-52 Stratofortresses out of Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts, with payloads of nuclear bombs. In all, he completed 116 combat missions in the Vietnam War and earned an Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters.

==Career==
After leaving the Air Force in 1969, Pitts moved to Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia and the hometown of his wife, Ginny. They built a house there, where they still live today.

Pitts was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1972, representing Kennett Square and surrounding areas of southeastern Chester County.

===U.S. House of Representatives===

====Elections====
After 10-term Republican congressman Bob Walker decided to retire in 1996, Pitts jumped into the crowded five-candidate Republican primary—the real contest in what has long been a strongly Republican district. He won the primary with 45% of the vote, defeating the second place candidate by 19 percentage points. In the general election, he defeated Democrat James G. Blaine 59%–38%.

He won re-election easily in 1998 (71%), 2000 (67%), 2002 (88%), and 2004 (64%).

=====2006=====

Pitts originally promised to serve only 10 years (five terms), but announced he would run again in 2006 amid considerable controversy. Despite the controversy, Pitts won re-election to a sixth term, defeating Democratic businesswoman Lois Herr 57%–40%. The seventeen-point margin was the second smallest margin in his career.

=====2008=====

In 2008, Pitts decided to seek a seventh term. He was challenged by Navy veteran and construction contractor Bruce Slater. Pitts defeated him 56%–39%. The sixteen-point margin was the smallest margin in his career.

=====2010=====

Pitts was challenged by Democrat Lois Herr for a third rematch. He won re-election to an 8th term, defeating her 65%–35%.

=====2012=====

Pitts was challenged by Democrat businesswoman Aryanna Strader and Independent Jim Bednarski In the general election, Pitts won re-election to a ninth term, defeating Strader 55%–39%. The sixteen-point margin is tied for 2008 in being the smallest margin in his career. He lost in Berks County by 12,000 votes (35%) and won Chester County by only 500 votes (1%). He won Lancaster handily with over 60% of the vote.

====Tenure====
Pitts has a very conservative voting record, which is not surprising given that his district has historically been one of the most Republican districts in the Northeast. However, redistricting made the 16th somewhat less Republican. The old 16th had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+8, but since the 2010 round of redistricting, it had a PVI of R+4. He received 100% ratings from the American Conservative Union in 2005 and the Christian Coalition of America in 2004.

In 2002, after a federal judge ordered the removal of the Ten Commandments from the Chester County courthouse, Pitts released a press statement that said, &quot;I think that religion and the Ten Commandments in particular should have a role in our public life&quot; and supported The Ten Commandments Defense Act (H.R. 2045). Since his first term Pitts has been chairman of the Values Action Team, a subgroup of the Republican Study Committee that coordinates legislation with the Christian right.

Over the years Pitts has received 100% ratings from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 0% ratings from Public Citizens Congress Watch. In 2008 the ACLU gave him an 18% rating, the Human Rights Campaign gave him a score of 0%, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights gave him a score of 4%. In 2007–08 the John Birch Society gave him a score of 67%, and the American Conservative Union gave him a 100% rating, as did the Christian Coalition. Others: American Association of University Women, 2007–08, 16%; Republicans for Environmental Protection, 7% in 2007; and the Children&#x27;s Health Fund, 2007–08, 0%; National Rifle Association, 2008, A; Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 2003, 0%; National Breast Cancer Coalition, 2007–08, 0%; Children&#x27;s Health Fund 2007–08, 0%. Ratings from labor groups are consistently at or near 0%; the Alliance for Worker Freedom, 2008, 100%.

Pitts visited Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban and Pakistan in 2002. He visited Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq, and Israel in 2008 as part of a Congressional Delegation. He is a leading congressional advocate of nuclear power, and &quot;introduced a bill in 2009 to fast-track the regulatory process for approving new reactors, he called it the &#x27;Streamline America&#x27;s Future Energy (SAFE) Nuclear Act.&#x27;&quot;

Pitts is an advocate of a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the Bob Goodlatte-Jim Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

The Stupak–Pitts Amendment is an amendment to America&#x27;s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 written by Pitts and Democrat Bart Stupak of Michigan, and it inserted abortion into the national health overhaul debate. This amendment continues his longtime opposition to abortion. According to Jeff Sharlet, a contributing editor for Harper&#x27;s, Pitts is a documented member of the Bible-oriented Christian group &quot;The Fellowship (Christian organization)&quot; and the C Street group in Washington, D.C.

In the 112th Congress, Pitts introduced the Protect Life Act, which would place additional restrictions on abortion access.

In July 2011, Pitts was revealed, in course of an FBI investigation, to have accepted tainted funds traced to the intelligence services of Pakistan. These funds were routed through the so-called Kashmiri American Council (KAC), run by Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, who was convicted of several felonies by the Federal government.

In October 2015, Pitts was named to serve on the Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood.

====Legislation====
On March 26, 2014, Pitts introduced the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (H.R. 4302; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would delay until March 2015 the pending cut to Medicare, a cut that has been regularly delayed for over a decade. The bill would not offset this spending with increased revenue or cuts to spending in other places, a source of controversy. Pitts said he still supports a permanent fix to the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula and is &quot;sponsoring this bill today because it is my earnest hope that this is the last patch we will have to pass.&quot;

On May 29, 2014, Pitts introduced into the House the Designer Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2014 (H.R. 4771; 113th Congress), a bill that would expand the list of anabolic steroids regulated by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to include about two dozen new substances and would establish new crimes relating to false labeling of steroids. This type of steroid enhances muscles. The bill would establish a penalty of up to $500,000 against those found to be falsely labeling their anabolic steroid products.

====Committee assignments====
* United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce
** United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy
** United States House Energy Subcommittee on Health (Chairman)
* Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe

====Caucus memberships====

<text>The San Remo is a cooperative apartment building at 145 and 146 Central Park West, between 74th and 75th Streets, adjacent to Central Park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. It was constructed from 1929 to 1930 and was designed by architect Emery Roth in the Renaissance Revival style. The San Remo is 27 stories tall, with twin towers rising from a 17-story base. The building is a contributing property to the Central Park West Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places–listed district, and is a New York City designated landmark.

The 17-story base surrounds an internal courtyard to the west, while the 10-story towers rise from the eastern portion of the base. There are numerous setbacks between the 14th and 17th stories, which double as terraces. The first three stories are clad in rusticated blocks of limestone, with two main entrances at ground level. The remainder of the facade is made of light brick with terracotta ornamentation, as well as movable windows to improve air circulation. The tops of the towers contain &quot;temples&quot; with round colonnades and lanterns. The building has twin terrazzo and marble lobbies with molded plaster ceilings. On the upper stories, many apartments contain living and dining rooms arranged around a central gallery, as well as bedrooms in the rear. There were originally 122 apartments, each with six to sixteen rooms, but several apartments have been split or combined over the years.

The San Remo replaced an 11-story apartment building with the same name, built in 1891. The current apartment complex was the first building on Central Park West to incorporate large twin towers. The building opened in September 1930, attracting large amounts of commentary from the media. It soon went into receivership following the collapse of the Bank of United States, which held the mortgage. The San Remo experienced financial difficulties throughout much of the 1930s before being acquired in 1940 by an investment syndicate. The building was converted to a housing cooperative in 1972 following a failed conversion attempt in 1970. Over the years, the San Remo has been renovated several times. Its residents have included directors, actors, and musicians.

==Site==
The San Remo is at 145 and 146 Central Park West in the Upper West Side neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building occupies the western sidewalk of Central Park West (formerly Eighth Avenue) between 74th Street to the south and 75th Street to the north. The San Remo occupies a nearly rectangular land lot with an area of . The land lot has a frontage of along Central Park West, on 74th Street, and on 75th Street. Nearby places include the Kenilworth apartment building immediately to the north, the Langham apartment building to the south, and the Ramble and Lake of Central Park to the east. In addition, the Dakota is two blocks south and the New-York Historical Society library and museum is two blocks north.

The San Remo is one of several apartment buildings on Central Park West that are primarily identified by an official name. Even though a street address was sufficient to identify these apartment buildings, this trend followed a British practice of giving names to buildings without addresses. By contrast, buildings on Fifth Avenue, along the eastern side of Central Park, are mainly known by their addresses. Christopher Gray of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the San Remo as one of several apartment buildings in Manhattan that were named after 1920; according to Gray, such structures usually &quot;were either truly grand or had hotel-like features&quot;. The San Remo&#x27;s name is derived directly from a previous building on the site.

===Previous structure===
The construction of Central Park in the 1860s spurred construction on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but similar development on the Upper West Side was slower to come. Major developments on the West Side were erected after the Ninth Avenue elevated line opened in 1879, providing direct access to Lower Manhattan. The first large apartment building in the area was the Dakota, which opened in 1884. The city installed power lines on Central Park West at the end of the 19th century, thus allowing the construction of multi-story apartment hotels with elevators.

Among the early apartment hotels was the original San Remo at 74th Street. The structure was built in 1891 by contractor Michael Brennan and designed by Edward L. Angell. The old San Remo was 11 stories tall with 90 apartments. It was decorated in the Gothic and Romanesque Revival styles and had peaked towers at its corners. The old San Remo was operated by Brennan following a dispute in 1892 with Wilson C. Morris, a hotel operator.

==Architecture==
The present San Remo was designed by Emery Roth. It is variously described as being in the neo-Renaissance or late Italian Renaissance style. Theodore Hofstatter decorated the building&#x27;s lobby, while Lou R. Strauss Jr. designed the internal garden and exterior landscaping. Unlike other large buildings on Central Park West, which were typically attributed to a single developer, no one took credit for developing the San Remo specifically. The syndicate that developed the San Remo had also erected the Beresford, seven blocks north, shortly before the San Remo was completed.

===Form===
The San Remo&#x27;s base is 17 stories high and surrounds a T-shaped interior courtyard to the west, giving the lower stories a U-shaped plan. The presence of the courtyard allowed each apartment to receive natural light from several elevations.

There are setbacks at the 14th, 16th, and 17th stories. The setbacks are covered in slate and double as terraces for some units. Two towers rise an additional ten stories from the eastern portion of the base and are arranged symmetrically. The San Remo is one of four buildings on Central Park West with a twin-towered form; the others are the Century, the Majestic, and the El Dorado. By splitting the upper stories into twin towers, as opposed to a single bulky tower, the developers could increase the amount of space that was near a window. To increase natural-light exposure to the upper-story apartments, the towers were designed in an &quot;L&quot; shape (wrapping around the courtyard), rather than as square masses. Roth designed spires that were high; according to general contractor HRH Construction; this made the building one of New York City&#x27;s tallest residential structures.

The massing of the San Remo, and those of similar buildings, was shaped primarily by the Multiple Dwelling Act of 1929. Under this legislation, the &quot;street walls&quot; of apartment buildings could rise one and a half times the width of the adjacent street before they had to set back. On lots of more than , the street walls could rise three times the width of the adjacent street. Apartment buildings could rise up to 19 stories; additional stories were allowed on large plots, but the floor areas of these stories were limited to 20 percent of the lot area. These upper stories were allowed on plots of at least and were required to be set back on all sides. The San Remo was the earliest apartment building on Central Park West to be built with twin towers following the passage of the Multiple Dwelling Act of 1929.

===Facade===
The facade contains metal, stone, and terracotta decorations. These details include pilasters, engaged columns, rounded and triangular broken pediments, and balustrades, as well as smaller motifs such as roundels, scrolls, urns, cartouches, garlands, and consoles. The lowest three stories of the facade are made of rusticated blocks of limestone, while the rest of the building is clad with beige brick. The limestone blocks on the first and second stories are vermiculated. Above the base, there is a small amount of terracotta ornament, which is used to emphasize the otherwise plain brick facade. The ornament on the upper stories is oversized, allowing it to be seen from the ground.

All elevations of the facade are divided vertically into several bays. On the lower stories, the Central Park West elevation is divided into 26 bays from north to south, while the 75th Street elevation contains 16 bays and the 74th Street elevation contains 19 bays. There are two groupings of six bays near the north and south ends of the Central Park West elevation, as well as a three-bay-wide &quot;pavilion&quot; on either end. Additionally, the center bays on Central Park West are divided into three pairs, flanked by two single bays. Hence, the Central Park West elevation is divided in a 3-6-1-2-2-2-1-3 configuration. The six center bays and three outermost bays are treated as &quot;pavilions&quot;, which rise above the setbacks. The towers are five bays wide on all elevations. A band course runs around the facade above the 13th story.

The windows on the primary elevations were divided horizontally into three tiers: a set of large movable casements, with movable transoms above and below. The casements and upper transoms swung outward, while the lower transoms swung inward. This design feature was intended to improve air circulation and temperature regulation, as air conditioning was uncommon when the building was completed. Roth anticipated that the upper and lower transoms would provide suitable air circulation most of the time and that the casements would only need to be opened on especially hot days. The windows on the rear elevations were arranged into multiple layouts, some of which have been altered.

====Entrances====

On the ground story, the Central Park West elevation has two main entrances, each two bays wide and placed in the middle of the six-bay-wide sections (bays 6–7 and 20–21 from south). Both entrances contain a set of bronze-and-glass double doors topped by a paneled bronze transom. Each door is divided into three glass panels with acanthus-leaf borders, as well as bronze medallions that resemble sunburst motifs. The sidewalk in front of each doorway is covered by a canopy. There are Art Deco metal-and-glass lanterns on either side of the doors. Above each set of doors is a triangular broken pediment and a single window on the second story. These entrances are surrounded by a limestone frame with pilasters on either side, which are topped by composite capitals. These pilasters support a curved broken pediment with corbels, as well as a central scrolled cartouche with garlands.

There are two secondary entrances: one in the 14th bay from east on 74th Street and the 13th bay from east on 75th Street. Each secondary entrance consists of a set of pilasters topped by a console table. A single bronze-and-glass door, similar in design to those on Central Park West, is recessed deeply within either entrance. There are metal-and-glass lanterns on either side of the doors. Above each doorway is a scrolled cartouche.

There are also nine entrances to individual offices on the ground floor: four on Central Park West, three on 74th Street, and two on 75th Street. Each doorway contains a single door, recessed within the rusticated limestone facade. The bronze-and-glass office doors are simple in design and are topped by a bronze-and-glass transom panel. On the far western end of the 74th and 75th Street frontages, there is a short standalone wall of rusticated blocks, which contains an archway topped by a rusticated keystone. There is a metal service gate below each archway, topped by a panel with the word &quot;service&quot;. The westernmost end of the 74th Street frontage, next to the service gate, contains a metal fence atop a brick parapet, which encloses an unused courtyard.

====Lower stories====
The second-easternmost bays on 74th and 75th Streets (bays 2–3) and the second-outermost bays on Central Park West (bays 2–3 and 24–25) have ornately decorated windows on the third and fourth stories. The third-story windows in these bays are flanked by limestone frames with rosettes and consoles; these support small balustrades at the fourth story. On either side of the second-outermost windows on all three elevations, a set of pilasters supports an entablature and a triangular broken pediment, both with dentils. There is a central keystone inside the pediment. Above the 13th story, there are console brackets flanking each of the second-outermost windows, above which is a balcony with a balustrade. These bays are flanked by brick pilasters at the 14th and 15th stories, which support large curved broken pediments and a scrolled escutcheon above the 15th story. There are rosettes at the tops of each pilaster. There are smaller curved broken pediments above the 14th-story windows, with escutcheons at the center as well as floral decorations and garlands below.

On Central Park West, bays 5–8 and 19–22 contain balconies at the fourth story. The balconies project from the facade and are supported by four console brackets. Behind each balcony, the two middle openings (bays 6–7 and 20–21) are surrounded by a limestone frame and separated from each other by a limestone wall panel. Above this frame is a triangular broken pediment with an escutcheon, garland, and tablet at its center. In bays 5–8 and 19–22 on the 11th story, there are two more balconies supported by four console brackets. Behind each balcony, bays 6–7 and 20–21 are recessed at the 11th and 12th stories and are flanked by brick pilasters; the recessed walls are decorated with embossed rosettes. Above the 12th story, and between bays 6–7 and 20–21, are cartouches with rosettes, similar to those above the main entrances on Central Park West.

There is another cartouche above the center of the fourth story on Central Park West, corresponding to bays 13–14. The numbers &quot;19&quot; and &quot;30&quot; flank the cartouche, signifying the year of the building&#x27;s completion. Above the 13th story, there are console brackets flanking bays 13–14, above which is a balcony with a balustrade. At the 14th and 15th stories, bays 13–14 merge into a single bay, which is flanked by brick pilasters and designed much like the second-outermost bays. The cartouche above the 15th story is flanked by a curved broken pediment instead of a triangular one. Additionally, the brick pilasters extend to the 16th and 17th stories; there are rosettes at the tops of each pilaster. The window on the 16th story is topped by a tablet with garlands and a broken triangular pediment, while that on the 17th story is capped by a cartouche.

====Towers====

The towers above the 17th story are five bays wide and contain protruding piers at each corner. The north tower&#x27;s northern and eastern elevations, as well as the south tower&#x27;s southern and eastern elevations, contain ornamentation on the upper halves of each tower. On the 23rd story, the central windows on each of these four elevations contain ornate frames and are topped by curved broken pediments with keystones. On the 26th and 27th stories, the three center bays of these elevations are ornately decorated. The center bay of each grouping is flanked by a pair of double-height engaged columns; these are supported by projecting brackets at the 26th story and are topped by foliate capitals above the 27th story. The outer bays of each grouping are flanked by flat pilasters, which are also topped by foliate capitals. Above the 27th story, there is a curved broken pediment with a cartouche in the center bay, as well as a triangular broken pediment in either of the outer bays.

Both towers contain a triple-level penthouse section above the 27th story. On the 29th story of both towers, corresponding to the second level of the penthouse, the northern, southern, and eastern elevations each contain a window within a limestone frame. This window is flanked by pilasters with rosettes on their capitals. On the 30th story, there are three protruding dormers on either tower, each with a single window and a rounded roof. The top and bottom edges of the dormer windows are rounded. There are console brackets flanking each dormer window, above which is a curved pediment.

Each tower is topped by a &quot;temple&quot; designed in the Corinthian order. According to Steven Ruttenbaum, the temples were patterned after the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates. The base of the temple is quadrilateral and contains eight large pedestals (two on each side). The pedestals contain console brackets, and the tops of the pedestals are decorated with urns and garlands; the finials of the urns measure tall. Between the pedestals on each side, there are cartouches with balustrades above them. The temples themselves rest on brick podiums and contain circular colonnades of smooth columns. Each column in the colonnade measures tall. Above the colonnades are friezes with dentils, as well as a terrace enclosed by a balustrade. Above the terrace level, a circular podium supports a set of console brackets, atop which is an electric copper lantern with windows on four sides. The lantern is tall.

===Features===
====Lobbies====
Each of the entrances on Central Park West leads to its own lobby. The floors of each lobby are composed of large square tiles of beige terrazzo, each of which contains a smaller inlaid gray-marble tile. The beige terrazzo tiles are surrounded by a multicolored band of mosaic tiles and a dark-green marble border. The lower sections of the lobbies&#x27; walls are wainscoted in oxblood red and beige, while the remainder of the lobby walls are a salmon-beige color with inlaid dark-brown panels. The walls are flat and contain red-and-brown marble doorways leading to various rooms, as well as lighting sconces made of glass and metal. There are &quot;art glass&quot; windows on the walls, overlooking the courtyard. The ceilings have elaborate bas-reliefs and contain flat, vaulted, and sloped surfaces. The ceiling originally had a polychrome color scheme, which was painted white in subsequent years. Hanging from the ceilings are metal-and-glass chandeliers shaped like inverted pyramids.

There are ten elevators in the San Remo, grouped into four banks. There are square-headed archways leading from each lobby to each set of elevators; the lintels are decorated with multicolored marble panels. Each of the elevator doors in the lobbies is made of bronze with geometric motifs.

====Apartments====
, the New York City Department of City Planning cites the San Remo as having 138 residential apartments and 8 non-residential units. Initially, there were 122 apartments in the building. Each apartment was designed with six to sixteen rooms, including single-story and double-story apartments. Each of the 17 lowest stories generally contained seven apartments per floor. Three of these units faced Central Park West and had eight, ten, or eleven rooms, while two units each faced 74th and 75th Streets, with six to eight rooms. This contrasted with other buildings on Central Park West, where four units on each floor shared a frontage on Central Park. A 1940 news article described the building as containing 132 apartments with five to fourteen rooms, with a total of 1,000 rooms. In the basement, each resident had their own laundry room, which was covered in tiles.

In larger apartments, common rooms such as the living room were arranged around a central gallery. A short hallway led to bedrooms in the rear, providing privacy for residents. The developers advertised the building as having atypically large rooms. There were several closets in each apartment, and the master bedroom of each unit also adjoined a dressing room. There were butlers&#x27; pantries and maids&#x27; rooms leading off each kitchen. Some of the westernmost units also contained &quot;sun rooms&quot;, which measured up to . Over the years, apartment layouts have been modified to accommodate the needs of individual tenants, and obliquely shaped spaces such as semicircular dining rooms were also created.

In the tower stories, each apartment originally occupied an entire floor. The original plans had called for five duplex units in the south tower, each with thirteen rooms across two stories, and ten simplex units in the north tower, each with six rooms on a single story. The lower level of each south-tower unit contained a library, dining room, kitchen, pantry, and two maids&#x27; rooms. A spiral staircase led up to four bedrooms and three maids&#x27; rooms on the upper level, thus providing a clear separation of &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; rooms. With the exception of the topmost unit, the south-tower duplexes were all split into two single-story units during the 1930s, each containing seven rooms. Some of the tower apartments have been combined and expanded over the years. For instance, musician Bono combined the 27th floor of the north tower with a portion of the former mechanical space above it, creating a duplex with of terraces. The duplex atop the south tower was also combined with the mechanical space above it in the 2010s, forming a triplex unit.

All of the ceilings are suspended from the structural beams and finished in plaster. Some ceilings have molded plaster reliefs, although even the simplest ceilings had molded plaster cornices. Ceiling heights varied in different rooms: larger rooms had ceilings of up to , while smaller rooms had shorter ceilings. Some apartments were subdivided in the 1930s and decorated with similar details. There are wood-burning fireplaces in the living rooms, with ornate fireplace mantels. The fireplaces were inefficient and outdated at the time of their construction, but they were nonetheless included for symbolic reasons. Roth designed steel-and-glass cabinets for the kitchens, which also had cork floors, tiled walls, and chromium-plated plumbing pipes. Underneath one window in each kitchen, there were compartments where fresh food could be stored; these compartments had vents facing outdoors. Each bathroom was tiled in a polychrome color scheme.

==History==
By the late 1920s, high-rise apartment buildings were being developed on Central Park West in anticipation of the completion of the New York City Subway&#x27;s Eighth Avenue Line, which opened in 1932. Central Park West was concurrently widened from . Under the Multiple Dwelling Act of 1929, this allowed the construction of proportionally taller buildings on the avenue. Just before the passage of the act, Emery Roth had designed the Beresford, seven blocks north of the old San Remo Hotel. In contrast to the San Remo, the Beresford had three towers, which were octagonal and relatively short.

===Development===
The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reported in mid-November 1928 that the original San Remo Hotel might be replaced with a 30-story apartment hotel. Two weeks later, a syndicate led by Henry M. Pollock bought the old San Remo from the Brennan estate, as well as several adjacent four-story houses to the west. The Pollock group planned to spend $7 million on a new building on the site. In April 1929, the Times Holding Corporation (which owned the San Remo Hotel) acquired a house at 4 West 75th Street. The firm planned to raze the house, which occupied part of the footprint of the new building&#x27;s courtyard. The San Remo Hotel closed the same month, and the Ravitch Brothers filed plans for a new apartment hotel on the same site. That July, San Remo Towers Inc. transferred a $5 million mortgage loan on the new building to the Bank of United States. Within a month, leasing agents Pease &amp; Elliman were renting out apartments at the new San Remo.

The San Remo Hotel had been demolished by September 1929, and the site of the new building was being excavated. The next month, Emery Roth filed plans for a 16-story apartment building on the site of the San Remo Hotel to cost $2.5 million. The plans were subsequently revised to a 26-story building, and the HRH Construction Corporation was hired that December as the general contractor.

The Bank of United States provided a $5 million loan in January 1930 to City Financial Corporation, one of its subsidiaries, which owned the building. The bank acquired 100 shares of San Remo Towers Inc. for about $1 million as part of a larger, $8 million transaction. By then, L. J. Phillips &amp; Co. had taken over as the building&#x27;s leasing agent. The San Remo ultimately cost $5.5 million to construct. HRH was paid $125,000 for its role as general contractor at the San Remo. HRH also agreed to manage the San Remo (as well as the Beresford, which it also built) in exchange for two percent of the buildings&#x27; gross profits. In a &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; article on September 14, 1930, the HRH Construction Company indicated that the San Remo would open that October.

===Rental house===

====Opening and receivership====

The building was completed on September 21, 1930. The developers advertised the San Remo as &quot;The Aristocrat of Central Park West&quot;. Almost immediately, the San Remo experienced financial issues, despite critical acclaim in the architectural media. The surrounding area had suffered after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and shantytowns were built directly across the street from the San Remo during the Great Depression. After the Bank of United States experienced a bank run in December 1930, it shut down and its top officials were charged with recklessly using depositors&#x27; funds for speculation. The New York State Banking Department took over the bank&#x27;s holdings, including the San Remo&#x27;s mortgage. Early the next month, contractors placed $423,000 worth of liens against San Remo Inc., and the Bank of United States moved to foreclose on the building&#x27;s $5 million mortgage loan. Joseph Ravitch, head of HRH Construction, testified that the bank and its affiliates owed him $40,000 for the San Remo&#x27;s construction. In April 1931, a court-appointed receiver for the San Remo received permission to borrow $60,000 to pay the building&#x27;s property taxes.

In spite of all these issues, a broker claimed in mid-1931 that large apartments at the San Remo were being steadily rented. Following further negotiations, the Banking Department liquidated all claims against the San Remo except for its own lien. The Banking Department announced in October 1931 that it would foreclose on the building. At the time, 88 of the 128 apartments had been rented, representing 70 percent of the units. These tenants paid an estimated $513,000 annually, more than sufficient to cover the operating costs. In early 1932, a court-appointed referee recommended that the building and land be sold together. The San Remo was placed for sale at a foreclosure auction that February, and the Bank of United States (still part of the Banking Department) acquired the building, bidding $1,021,000. In December 1932, the bank gave a new first-mortgage loan of $1.5 million to the San Remo Realty Company, a subsidiary of the bank that had taken over the building.

====1930s to early 1970s====

Throughout the Depression, the building went bankrupt several times and passed to numerous owners. The owners reduced rents and created 20 additional apartments by subdividing four of the duplexes in the south tower and some vacant units at the base. The Banking Department announced in July 1935 that it would refinance the building with a $3.1 million loan from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and would use the funds to distribute dividends to the Bank of United States&#x27; depositors. Some creditors expressed opposition to the mortgage, but a representative of the Banking Department said the state government wished to sell the building and that a mortgage would facilitate such a sale. A state judge approved the mortgage that September. By 1938, there were 117 families in the building. As the state was trying to find a buyer for the building, its staff went on strike in March 1938 and again in November 1938. The journalist Peter Osnos wrote that the San Remo and other Central Park West apartment houses contained many Jewish residents during the 1930s and 1940s, since these buildings were not &quot;restricted&quot;, unlike others on the East Side.

In July 1940, a group of anonymous investors acquired the San Remo and Beresford, assuming a combined $7.4 million in mortgages on the two structures. The buildings themselves cost only $25,000, although they had cost a combined $10 million to build. One observer likened the sale to &quot;buying the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; for pocket change&quot;. The investment group was known as the Sanbere Corporation, a portmanteau of the two buildings&#x27; names. The San Remo&#x27;s staff occasionally went on strike, such as in 1942 and in 1950. The San Remo also had twenty rooms for maids, many of which had been converted to tenant storage spaces or offices by the early 1960s.

By the mid-1960s, a dozen apartment buildings on Central Park West had been converted into housing cooperatives. At the end of the decade, Harry B. Helmsley and his partner Lawrence Wien proposed converting the San Remo into a cooperative. Helmsley had an option to acquire the San Remo for $12 million and planned to sell it to tenants for $15 million. Most residents supported the idea of a co-op conversion, but 86 percent of residents objected that the prices for each apartment, at over $100,000 each, were far too high. A group of tenants organized to express opposition to the proposal. Helmsley and Wien withdrew their plan in June 1970 because not enough residents had purchased shares in the cooperative, despite having lowered the prices for each apartment. For the offering to go into effect, at least 35 percent of the residents had to buy shares. Helmsley lost $1.25 million in the process, amid a weakening market for co-op apartments, and the San Remo reverted to its previous owners.

===Cooperative conversion===

====1970s to 1990s====

An investment syndicate, the Nominee Realty Corporation, bought the building for $9 million in July 1971. Nominee Realty did not originally intend to convert the building into a co-op, but it agreed to sell the building to its tenants to reduce costs. The tenants released a $10.8 million co-op offering plan in May 1972, including a $1 million contingency fund. About 85 percent of tenants bought shares in the cooperative within four months, and the co-op offering went into effect in September 1972. The co-op board initially did not seek official city-landmark status for the building, as that would have raised the cost of maintenance. The building retained most of its original windows, except for two upper-story apartments, where the windows were replaced with single panes in the early 1970s. Afterward, the San Remo&#x27;s co-op board banned window replacements in anticipation of a potential city-landmark designation. Paul Goldberger, president of the co-op board, said the board members had a &quot;self-imposed tradition of treating the building as if it were a landmark&quot;.

The San Remo&#x27;s co-op board began restoring the facade in the early 1980s. The terracotta details atop the building&#x27;s temples were replicated in lightweight concrete. All other terracotta was preserved or replaced in the same material. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the San Remo as a city landmark in March 1987. As a result, the LPC was obliged to review all proposed changes to the exterior. The board planned to replace the multi-paned windows with three-pane windows that resembled the original design. Due to the high cost of renovating the windows, the San Remo&#x27;s co-op board decided to replace the windows only when apartments had been vacated. The exterior restoration ultimately lasted about one decade.

By 1996, units in buildings on Central Park West were in high demand. For instance, one unit in the San Remo was purchased after being listed for just three days, while another unit received an unusually high number of inquiries from Upper East Side residents. Another renovation of the exterior began in the late 1990s. The south tower had been restored by the end of 1999, and work on the north tower was scheduled to be conducted.

====2000s to present====
The San Remo&#x27;s board voted in 2000 to impose a six-month time limit for apartment renovations, imposing heavy fines on residents who violated the rule. Many residents had complained that director Steven Spielberg and entrepreneur Steve Jobs were conducting multi-year renovations of their respective apartments. In 2006, the San Remo&#x27;s co-op board banned residents from using fireplaces. By the end of the decade, prices exceeded $3 million even for comparatively small apartments with two bedrooms. Some residents owned their apartments for long periods. When an apartment in the south tower was placed for sale in 2010, only one south-tower apartment had been sold in the preceding 16 years. In another case in 2011, the previous owner had resided in the apartment since the 1950s.

The San Remo attracted many residents in the entertainment industry, especially as compared to other Central Park West buildings, where wealthy people lived in relative obscurity. By the 2010s, many of the celebrities who had lived in the San Remo had moved out, and a growing proportion of residents worked in the finance industry. Among the remaining celebrities in the San Remo in 2017 were musician Bono and actor Steve Martin.

==Residents==
According to a 1996 article in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, many brokers classified the San Remo as one of five top-tier apartment buildings on Central Park West, largely because of its high concentration of celebrities and its views of the Lake in Central Park. The others were 88 Central Park West, 101 Central Park West, the Dakota, and the Beresford. &quot;The Real Deal&quot; wrote in 2017: &quot;The building’s individuality, its willingness to boast, is [...] reflected in its high-profile residents.&quot; Notable residents have included:

The San Remo&#x27;s co-op board has a reputation for &quot;lenient admissions standards&quot; compared to the conservative, old-money boards on the other side of the park. Nonetheless, in 1985, the co-op board voted against allowing performer Madonna to buy an apartment in the building. Tenants cited concerns that Madonna&#x27;s presence would attract paparazzi, although, at the time, nude pictures of her had recently circulated in &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines. Madonna ultimately bought another apartment on Central Park West; the San Remo&#x27;s board eventually approved her application more than two decades later, in 2008. The co-op board also voted against allowing fashion designer Calvin Klein to move into the San Remo. Steve Jobs bought and renovated a penthouse apartment but never lived in it, ultimately selling it to Bono in 2003.

In the early 21st century, residents of the San Remo were among the biggest donors to the U.S. Democratic Party, and resident Andrew Tobias was treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. The San Remo&#x27;s residents donated more to the John Kerry 2004 presidential campaign than residents of any other building in the United States, giving Kerry $192,000 by April 2004. During that election, &quot;The New York Observer&quot; described the San Remo as &quot;the financial anchor for New York&#x27;s left coast&quot;, because contributions from the San Remo overwhelmingly went to Democratic candidates. In September 2012, &quot;New York Times&quot; columnists wrote &quot;for the past few elections, the San Remo has been an ATM for Democratic presidential campaigns&quot;, though contributions through July 2012 favored Romney over Obama, $331,625 to $101,367.

==Impact==

===Reception===

Because the San Remo was the earliest twin-towered apartment building on Central Park West, its completion attracted large amounts of commentary from the press. &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized it as &quot;an imposing addition to the tall structures overlooking Central Park&quot;. In March 1931, the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects presented a model of the San Remo Towers, describing it as &quot;an interesting development of the new dwellings law where large plottage permits the erection of towers&quot;. George S. Chappell, writing under the pseudonym &quot;T-Square&quot;, praised the design of the casement windows in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Several observers also commented specifically on the San Remo&#x27;s towers. Chappell wrote that the towers &quot;are fine in silhouette&quot;. In the 1970s, Paul Goldberger described the San Remo as &quot;the best of the four twin‐towered buildings that bring such splendid life to the Central Park West skyline&quot;, at a time when Roth&#x27;s firm mostly designed buildings with glass facades. Carter B. Horsley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the spires in 1972 as having been included &quot;almost as an excuse to imitate the architecture of the past&quot;. Horsley subsequently listed the San Remo as having one of the ten best water-tower enclosures in New York City. The writer Elizabeth Macaulay-Lewis said in 2021: &quot;The San Remo&#x27;s Choragic towers served as outward markers of architectural elegance that could be used to lend distinction to broad, tall apartment buildings that might otherwise run the risk of being drably similar to one another.&quot;

The building&#x27;s architectural style and materials were also the subject of commentary. Goldberger favorably compared the San Remo&#x27;s classical design with that of the Majestic, which was designed at exactly the same time in a modern Art Deco style. John Freeman Gill of the &quot;Times&quot; wrote in 2005 that the San Remo was one of several buildings on Central Park West whose bases exhibited &quot;the comfortable old solidity of limestone&quot;. Eric Nash, in his 2005 book &quot;Manhattan Skyscrapers&quot;, wrote that &quot;the towers play powerfully against the background element of the sky, etching the setback image in negative space&quot;, similarly to the Petronas Towers.

In the late 20th and early 21st century, the San Remo generally had a reputation for being luxurious. In 1996, a writer for &quot;Interior Design&quot; magazine said the San Remo was &quot;among the Upper West Side&#x27;s top-drawer co-ops, the buildings that evoke the basic emotions of lust and envy when one thinks-or dreams-of the apartments within&quot;. During the 2000s, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the presence of Central Park West&#x27;s &quot;architectural gems&quot;, such as the San Remo, contributed to increased housing prices on the eastern side of Central Park, along Fifth Avenue. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; referred to the Beresford, the Dakota, and the San Remo as the &quot;three grand dames of the West Side&quot;. Additionally, the artist Max Ferguson created an oil painting of the San Remo in 2004. Several books have used the painting on their covers, including a 2011 edition of the Jack Finney novel &quot;Time and Again&quot;.

===Landmark designations===
The building is a contributing property to the Central Park West Historic District, which was recognized by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places when its nomination was accepted on November 9, 1982. In 1984, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) hosted hearings to determine whether the Century, Majestic, San Remo, Beresford, and El Dorado should be designated as city landmarks. Manhattan Community Board 7 supported all five designations, but the San Remo&#x27;s co-op board was concerned about whether a landmark designation would hinder the replacement of windows on the building. The LPC designated the San Remo as a city landmark on March 31, 1987. The San Remo is also part of the Upper West Side Historic District, which became a New York City historic district in 1990.

<text>Messier 65 (also known as NGC 3623) is an intermediate spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the constellation Leo, within its highly equatorial southern half. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780. With M66 and NGC 3628, it forms the Leo Triplet, a small close group of galaxies.

==Discovery==
M65 was discovered by Charles Messier and included in his Messier Objects list. However, William Henry Smyth accidentally attributed the discovery to Pierre Méchain in his popular 19th-century astronomical work &quot;A Cycle of Celestial Objects&quot; (stating &quot;They [M65 and M66] were pointed out by Méchain to Messier in 1780&quot;). This error was in turn picked up by Kenneth Glyn Jones in &quot;Messier&#x27;s Nebulae and Star Clusters&quot;. This has since ramified into a number of other books by a variety of authors.

==Star formation==
The galaxy is low in dust and gas, and there is little star formation in it, although there has been some relatively recently in the arms. The ratio of old stars to new stars is correspondingly quite high. In most wavelengths it is quite uninteresting, though there is a radio source visible in the NVSS, offset from the core by about two arc-minutes. The identity of the source is uncertain, as it has not been identified visually, or formally studied in any published papers.

==Interaction with other galaxies==
To the eye, M65&#x27;s disk appears slightly warped, and its relatively recent burst of star formation is also suggestive of some external disturbance. Rots (1978) suggests that the two other galaxies in the Leo Triplet interacted with each other about 800 million years ago. Recent research by Zhiyu Duan suggests that M65 may also have interacted, though much less strongly. He also notes that M65 may have a central bar—it is difficult to tell because the galaxy is seen from an oblique angle—a feature which is suggestive of tidal disruption.

<doc id="964136" wikidata="Q1207310" url="?curid=964136" title="Battle of Orsha">
<text>The Battle of Orsha (, ), was fought on 8 September 1514, between the allied forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, under the command of Lithuanian Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski; and the army of the Grand Duchy of Moscow under Konyushy Ivan Chelyadnin and Kniaz Mikhail Bulgakov-Golitsa. The Battle of Orsha was part of a long series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars conducted by Muscovite rulers striving to gather all the former Kievan Rus&#x27; lands under their rule.

According to &quot;Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii&quot; by Sigismund von Herberstein, the primary source for information on the battle, the much smaller army of Lithuania–Poland (under 30,000 men) defeated a force of 80,000 Muscovite soldiers, capturing their camp and commander. These numbers and proportions have been disputed by some modern historians.

==Eve of battle==
At the end of 1512, the Grand Duchy of Moscow began a new war for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania&#x27;s Ruthenian lands in present-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. Albrecht I, Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, rebelled and refused to give a vassal pledge to Sigismund I the Old of Poland-Lithuania, as required by the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). Albrecht I was supported by Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor.

The fortress of Smolensk was then the easternmost outpost of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and one of the most important strongholds guarding it from the east. It repelled several Muscovite attacks, but in July 1514 a Muscovite army besieged and finally captured it. Spurred on by this initial success, the Grand Prince of Moscow Vasili III ordered his forces farther into present-day Belarus, occupying the towns of Krichev, Mstislavl, and Dubrovna.

Meanwhile, Sigismund the Old gathered some 35,000 troops, most of whom (57%) were Poles, for war with his eastern neighbor. His army was inferior in numbers, but consisted mostly of well-trained cavalry.

The regular Polish army was commanded by . It was the largest one that the Crown had hitherto put in the field. was in charge of the private Polish detachments and household troops. The Lithuanian landed service (some 15,000 soldiers) was led by Grand Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski and Field Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł. The Lithuanian-Polish forces included 32,500 cavalry and 3,000 mercenary infantry. Sigismund left 4,000–5,000 men in the town of Barysau, while the main force, placed under the command of Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski and around 30,000 strong, moved on to face the Muscovites.

At the end of August, several skirmishes took place at the crossings of the Berezina, Bobr, and Drut Rivers, but the Muscovite army avoided a major confrontation.

Suffering negligible losses, the Muscovites advanced to the area between Orsha and Dubrovno on the Krapivna River, where they set up camp. Ivan Chelyadnin, confident that the Lithuanian–Polish forces would have to cross one of the two bridges on the Dnieper River, split his own forces to guard those crossings. However, Ostrogski&#x27;s army crossed the river farther north via two pontoon bridges. On the night of 7 September, the Lithuanian-Polish army began preparations for a final battle with the Muscovites. Hetman Konstantyn Ostrogski placed most of his 16,000 horses from the Grand Duchy in the center, while most of the Polish infantry and the auxiliary troops manned the flanks. The Bohemian and Silesian infantry were deployed in the center of the line, in front of the reserves comprising Lithuanian and Polish cavalry.

===Size of the Muscovite army===

The size of the Muscovite army remains an unsolved question. Narrative Lithuanian sources generally give large numbers. King Sigismund wrote to Pope Leo X about a &quot;horde of Muscovites&quot; which consisted of 80,000 men. Sigismund also claimed that his army had killed 30,000 Muscovites and taken prisoner 46 commanders and 1,500 nobles. Extant Polish and Lithuanian documents, however, list all captured nobles by name; only 611 men in all. The Polish historian Bohun considers it improvident to rely on what he terms &quot;propaganda data&quot; given by Sigismund. According to the Sigismund description of the disposition of the Russian troops, each regiment outnumbers even modern divisions. Gembarowicz (another Polish researcher) is of the opinion that the Muscovite army was about 40,000 strong. It also remains unclear why – if the figure of 70,000–80,000 men is to be trusted – King Sigismund (who knew about this superiority of the Muscovite army from Mikhail Glinsky&#x27;s letters) kept a personal guard of about 5,000 men (about 15% of his army) in reserve, without sending them into the battle. The Muscovite chronicles (Novgorodian and Sophian codexes) claim a Lithuanian numerical superiority.

The Russian historian A. Lobin tried to calculate the size of the Muscovite army at Orsha based on the mobilisation capacities of the towns which had to send townspeople for military service. It is known that except for Boyar sons of the sovereign&#x27;s regiment, the army consisted of people from at least 14 towns: Novgorod, Pskov, Velikie Luki, Kostroma, Murom, Borovsk, Tver, Volok, Roslavl, Vyazma, Pereyaslavl, Kolomna, Yaroslavl, and Starodub. Based on figures from the well-documented Polotsk campaign of 1563, the author gives the following estimates: 400–500 Tatars, 200 boyar sons of the sovereign&#x27;s regiment, 3,000 Novgorodian and Pskovians, and about 3,600 representatives of other towns, altogether about 7,200 noblemen. Once servants are included, the overall size of the Muscovite army could be 13,000–15,000 men. Considering the losses during the campaign, the level of desertion which is documented in the sources and the number of soldiers left as a garrison in Smolensk; the number of Muscovite troops present at Orsha could have been as low as about 12,000 men. This calculation method has been backed by Brian Davies (University of Texas at San Antonio), and Russian historians N. Smirnov, A. Pankov, O. Kurbatov, М. Krom, and V. Penskoy. An earlier estimate also noted that at the beginning of the 16th century, the Russia could not even gather 40,000 in its ranks. Vitaly Penskoi analyzing the structure of the Russian army, also came to the conclusion that in the largest military campaigns under Vasily III, Muscovites could not have more than 20,000.

==Battle==
On 8 September, shortly after dawn, Ivan Chelyadnin gave the order to attack. The Muscovite forces attempted to outflank the Lithuanians and Poles by attacking their flanks, which were manned by Polish, Lithuanian light hussar, and Tartar troops. One of the pincers of the attack was commanded by Chelyadnin personally, while the other was led by Prince Bulgakov-Golitsa. The initial attack failed, and the Muscovites withdrew toward their starting positions. Chelyadnin was still confident that the odds, almost 3:1 in his favor, would give him the victory. However, preoccupied with his own wing of the Muscovite forces, he lost track of the other sectors and failed to coordinate a defense against the counterattack by the Lithuanian light and Polish heavy cavalry, which until then had been kept in reserve.

The Lithuanian and Polish light horse and Tartars attacked the overstretched center of the Muscovite lines in an attempt to split them. At the crucial moment the Polish cavalry seemed to waver, then went into retreat. The Muscovites pursued with all their cavalry reserves. The Lithuanian Tartars and Polish cavalry, after retreating for several minutes under chase from the Russians, suddenly turned to the sides. The Muscovite cavalry now found themselves confronted by artillery concealed in the forest. From both sides, Lithuanian forces appeared and proceeded to surround the Muscovites. Ivan Chelyadnin sounded retreat, which soon became somewhat panicked. The Muscovite forces were pursued by the army of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for five kilometres.

The Muscovite defeat is often attributed to repeated failures by Ivan Chelyadnin and Mikhail Golitsa to coordinate their operations.

Sigismund von Herberstein reported that 40,000 Muscovites were killed. According to accounts in Polish chronicles, 30,000 Russians were killed and an additional 3,000 were taken captive, including Ivan Chelyadnin and eight other commanders. The forces of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania seized the Muscovite camp and all 300 cannons. Upset at word of the massive defeat, Grand Prince Vasili III allegedly remarked that &quot;the prisoners [were] as useful as the dead&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Ostrogski&#x27;s forces continued their pursuit of the routed Russian army and retook most of the previously captured strongholds, including Mstislavl and Krychev, and the advancement of the Russians was stopped for four years. However, the Lithuanian and Polish forces were too exhausted to besiege Smolensk before the winter. This meant that Ostrogski did not reach the gates of Smolensk until late September, giving Vasili III enough time to prepare defense.

In December, Hetman Konstanty Ostrogski triumphantly entered Vilnius. To commemorate the victory, two Orthodox churches were erected: the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Church of Saint Nicholas, which remain among the most impressive examples of Eastern Orthodox Church architecture in Lithuania. Immediately after the victory, the Polish–Lithuanian state started to exploit the battle for its propaganda aimed at other nations in Europe, with the intent of improving the image of Poland-Lithuania abroad. Several panegyrical accounts of the battle were sent to Rome. &quot;The Polish message was similar to Bomhover&#x27;s: the Muscovites are not Christians; they are cruel and barbaric; they are Asians and not Europeans; they are in league with Turks and the Tatars to destroy Christendom&quot;.

Impressed by the scope of the Lithuanian and Polish victory, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, started peace negotiations with the Jagiellons in Vienna. On 22 July 1515, final agreements for peace were made and the broad coalition against Lithuania and Poland ceased.

The war between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Grand Duchy of Moscow lasted until 1520. In 1522 a peace was signed, under the terms of which Lithuania was forced to cede to Moscow about a quarter of its possessions within the lands of the former Kievan Rus&#x27;, including Smolensk. The latter city was not retaken until almost a century later, in 1611. After the peace agreement of 1522, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania tried to attack Moscow one more time, but major military conflicts were settled for around 40 years.

==Modern times==
The battle is regarded by some Belarusians as a symbol of national revival, with many seeing it as a Day of Belarusian Military Glory. On 8 September 1992, the 478th anniversary of the battle, cadets from Minsk Higher Military Engineering School and the Minsk Higher Military Command School (now the unified Military Academy of Belarus) took the first military oath of allegiance to the Armed Forces of Belarus, with their induction ceremony being held on Independence Square in the presence of defense minister Pavel Pavlovich Kozlovsky. Subsequently, however, as a result of increasing ties to Russia, the regime of President Alexander Lukashenko actively suppressed celebration of the battle. In September 2005, four members of the Belarusian National Front opposition were each fined almost (roughly €1,500) for celebrating the 491st anniversary of the battle.

Ukraine has public celebrations of the Battle of Orsha, as an important victory, within the wider history of Ukrainian-Russian conflicts. On October 14, 2014, the National Bank of Ukraine presented a commemorative coin on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the Battle of Orsha. There is Orsha Victory Street in Rivne.

At the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, the Battle of Orsha is commemorated by the inscription &quot;ORSZA 8 IX 1514&quot;.

In Lithuania, the Battle of Orsha is commemorates as well by Lithuanian Ministry of Defense and Lithuanian government every year with concerts, conferences and military parades.

==Popular culture==
On the BBC television program &quot;Being Human&quot;, Hal Yorke was made a vampire after the Battle of Orsha.

==Legacy==
In 1514, in appreciation for the victory in the battle, Konstanty Ostrogski built the Church and monastery of Holy Trinity in Vilnius.

<text>Todd Russell Platts (born March 5, 1962) is an American attorney and Republican Party politician who serves as a Judge on the York County Court of Common Pleas and is a former U.S. Representative for , serving from 2001 to 2013.

The district, since redrawn and renumbered, encompassed south-central Pennsylvania, including all of York and Adams Counties, and a large portion of Cumberland County. York, Hanover, Gettysburg and Carlisle were some of the prominent cities and towns included. In January 2012, Platts announced his intention to retire from Congress.

==Early life and education==
Platts was born in York, Pennsylvania, on March 5, 1962. He graduated from York Suburban Senior High School in 1980. He continued his education locally, graduating summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Public Administration from Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania in 1984. He then attended Pepperdine University School of Law, and graduated cum laude with a Juris Doctor degree in 1991. He is an Episcopalian.

==Pennsylvania House of Representatives==
Platts was first elected to public office in November 1992, to represent the 196th legislative district in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The election marked the first time that the 196th district was fought on its present boundaries; following the 1990 census, the approved legislative reapportionment plan moved it out of Philadelphia, and into its present boundaries. He took office on January 5, 1993, and left on November 30, 2000.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
While in Congress, Platts refused to accept contributions from any special interests or political action committees. He also promised to serve only six terms (12 years) in the House.

;2000
Platts was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000, after winning a little over half the vote in a crowded Republican primary, and easily defeating college professor Jeff Sanders, the Democratic nominee, in the general election. He replaced Congressman Bill Goodling, who chose not to run for re-election that year.

;2002–2006
Platts ran unopposed by the Democratic Party during the 2002 and 2004 elections, although in 2002, he faced opposition in the Republican primary, most notably from Tom Glennon. He faced York College professor and decorated Vietnam Veteran Phil Avillo, Jr., the Democratic nominee, and Derf Maitland of the Green Party in the 2006 election. Platts won 64% of the vote to Avillo&#x27;s 33% and Maitland&#x27;s 3%.

;2008
* United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#District 19
In 2008, Platts and Avillo faced off again. With 67% of the vote, Platts became the most electorally successful Republican Congressional candidate in the Northeast.

;2010
* United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 19
Platts was challenged by Democratic nominee Ryan Sanders and Independent Patriots nominee Joshua Monighan. Platts was re-elected to a sixth term with 72% of the vote.

===Tenure===
As a Congressman, Platts supported many of President George W. Bush&#x27;s initiatives, tax cuts, drilling in ANWR, the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the Iraq War, and a ban on same-sex marriage.

He opposed any version of Bush&#x27;s school voucher proposal, supported offshore oil drilling, supported increasing government regulated fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, voted for the Matthew Shepard Act, a hate crimes prevention bill, and supported the McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation. In 2006, the National Journal political index describes him as having a moderate voting record despite the relatively conservative nature of his district, although the district does include some exurbs of Baltimore, Maryland. That journal gave him &quot;conservative&quot; ratings of 53% (economy), 65% (social issues) and 73% (foreign policy) in the 2004 congress. Platts&#x27; district went 64–36 for Bush in 2004. He has broken with his party on several issues, for example supporting President Obama&#x27;s expansion of SCHIP and the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.

He is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and supports stem-cell research. Early in his political career, after his initial election to the Pennsylvania House, Platts supported abortion rights. However, he later changed his views and became anti-abortion. He remained so through his congressional career, and he had an anti-abortion voting record as a Congressman.

Platts consistently voted against bail-outs of the financial industry and the automakers. He also voted against the economic stimulus legislation, the fiscal year 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act, and fiscal year 2010 Budget Resolution.

Platts was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the United States military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; ban on openly gay service members.

Along with nearly all other Republican members of the US House of Representatives, Mr. Platts voted to support The Path to Prosperity, the budget put forward by U.S. Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI). However, the next year he joined nine other Republicans in voting against Rep. Ryan&#x27;s budget.

===Committee assignments===

;Caucus Memberships
* Congressional Arts Caucus

==Judicial career==
In 2013, Platts announced that he was running for a seat on the York County Court of Common Pleas. In a poll conducted by the York County Bar Association, 77% of its members responded that they believed Platts to be &quot;not qualified&quot; to serve on the bench. Platts and incumbent judge Mike Flannelly, also a Republican, who was appointed to the seat in 2012 following the death of Judge Chuck Patterson, both cross-filed to run in both the Democratic and Republican primary elections. Platts won the Republican primary 56%–44%, while Flannelly won the Democratic primary by the same margin. Platts and Flannelly faced each other again in the general election in November, which Platts won with 58% of the vote, to serve a ten-year term.

In 2023, Platts was retained by an overwhelming margin and elected to a second ten-year term with an expiration in 2033.

<doc id="964138" wikidata="Q310122" url="?curid=964138" title="Universal Abit">
<text>Universal ABIT Co., Ltd (formerly ABIT Computer Corporation) was a computer components manufacturer, based in Taiwan, active since the 1980s. Its core product line were motherboards aimed at the overclocker market. ABIT experienced serious financial problems in 2005. The brand name &quot;ABIT&quot; and other intangible properties, including patents and trademarks, were acquired by Universal Scientific Industrial Co., Ltd. (USI) in May 2006.

The parent firm discontinued the brand as of 31 March 2009.

== History ==
ABIT was founded in 1989. In 1991, the company had become the fastest growing motherboard manufacturer, claiming US$10 million in sales.
In 2000, ABIT underwent an initial public offering (IPO) on the TAIEX stock exchange. To keep pace with their &quot;good&quot; sales figures, they opened a factory in Suzhou, China, and moved to new headquarters in Neihu, Taipei. The number of motherboards sold was claimed to have doubled between 2000 and 2001.

Abit chose to outsource two low-end boards for trial production from June 2002 to Elitegroup Computer Systems. Confirmation of the outsourcing move was made public in July 2002, accounting for 10% of Abit&#x27;s motherboard shipments for the first model, and by August 2002, this would increase to 15-20% for the second model, for the company&#x27;s niche products, such as servers and routers, Abit&#x27;s factory in Taoyuan, Taiwan factory will then serve as their base.

Abit had somewhat of a blow in March 2003, when Oskar Wu, a leading engineer on the famous ABIT NF7-S motherboard, resigned after the NForce series to become head of the LANParty range at competitor DFI.

On 15 December 2004, the Taiwan Stock Exchange downgraded ABIT&#x27;s stock due to questionable accounting practices. Investigations revealed that the majority of their import/export business was conducted through seven companies, all located at the same address and each of which had a capital of only HK$2. This made it easy to inflate the reported number of motherboards sold. The Hong Kong media also reported that the management was being investigated for embezzling funds from the company.

In June 2005, ABIT partnered with Wan Hai Industries. This container shipping company, also a principal investor in China Airlines, brought the company much needed capital, since the company had financial problems at this time, partly due to a class action lawsuit involving faulty capacitors on their products, but also because of marketing highly technical products to the general public while offering longer-than-average warranties and generous return policies.

On 25 January 2006, ABIT announced that USI intended to purchase ABIT Computer&#x27;s motherboard business and brand and announced a special shareholders&#x27; meeting to discuss the sale of ABIT&#x27;s Neihu building, changing ABIT&#x27;s company name, the disposition of the company&#x27;s assets, and the release of the directors from non-competition restrictions. ABIT sold its own office building in Taipei to Deutsche Bank in order to raise money to cut its debt.

Following USI&#x27;s acquisition of the motherboard business, the remaining divisions of ABIT switched to distributing components and networking products, while using its Suzhou, China plant only to offer some motherboard contract manufacturing services.

The acquired motherboard business and the &#x27;ABIT&#x27; brand name were used by USI under the new brand name Universal Abit. In the US, it was known as Universal Abit USA Corporation. The old company, ABIT Computer Corporation (USA), is now dissolved and is no longer in existence.

Universal Abit later announced that it would close on 31 December 2008, and officially cease to exist on 1 January 2009.
By 2009, Abit no longer sold motherboards.

Universal Abit was located in Neihu, Taiwan with regional offices in China, USA, Iran and the Netherlands.

== Technical achievements ==
ABIT had a reputation among PC enthusiasts for producing motherboards that support overclocking. In the late 1990s, the company introduced their &quot;Softmenu&quot; feature, one of the first jumperless CPU configuration systems that enable overclocking to be adjusted from the BIOS instead of fiddling with jumpers. Softmenu was later extended with the development of the &quot;μGuru&quot; chip. μGuru is a custom microprocessor on Abit motherboards which, in conjunction with ABIT software, gives the ability to modify overclocking settings in real-time while the OS is running. By providing instant feedback on the results of a particular overclock setting, μGuru reduced the time required to discover optimal settings. μGuru provided a special connector for a panel in a 5¼&quot; drive bay to display CPU speed and voltage settings. They were also one of the first motherboard manufacturers to enable undervolting.

ABIT was the first motherboard manufacturer to introduce 133 MHz FSB operation for the Intel BX chipset with the aptly named AB-BX133. ABIT also achieved symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) operation for Intel&#x27;s Mendocino Celeron CPU, in their BP6 motherboard. This was an achievement because Intel had blocked SMP operation in the Celeron.

In 2004, they introduced the OTES cooling system. This heat pipe based cooling system is intended to transfer heat from the chipset or the motherboard&#x27;s voltage regulators and expel it out of the system through the rear I/O panel.

During Computex 2008, Universal Abit unveiled the FunFab P80 Digital Photo Frame and Printer. It integrated a photo printer directly to a mobile phone.

<text>The Leo Triplet (also known as the M66 Group) is a small group of galaxies about 35 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. This galaxy group consists of the spiral galaxies M65, M66, and NGC 3628.

==Members==
The table below lists galaxies that have been consistently identified as group members in the Nearby Galaxies Catalog, the Lyons Groups of Galaxies (LGG) Catalog, and the group lists created from the Nearby Optical Galaxy sample of Giuricin et al.

===Member list===
Additionally, some of the references cited above indicate that one or two other nearby galaxies may be group members. NGC 3593 is frequently but not consistently identified as a member of this group.

==Nearby groups==
The M96 Group is located physically near the Leo Triplet. These two groups may actually be separate parts of a much larger group,
and some group identification algorithms actually identify the Leo Triplet as part of the M96 Group.

<text>Vashti (; ; ) was a queen of Persia and the first wife of Persian king Ahasuerus in the Book of Esther, a book included within the Tanakh and the Old Testament which is read on the Jewish holiday of Purim. She was either executed or banished for her refusal to appear at the king&#x27;s banquet to show her beauty as Ahasuerus wished, and was succeeded as queen by Esther, a Jew. That refusal might be better understood via the Jewish tradition that she was ordered to appear naked. In the Midrash, Vashti is described as wicked and vain; she is viewed as an independent-minded heroine in feminist theological interpretations of the Purim story.

Attempts to identify her as one of the Persian royal consorts mentioned in extra-biblical records remain speculative.

==Etymology and meaning==
Hoschander proposed that it originated as a shortening of an unattested &quot;vashtateira&quot;, which he also proposed as the origin of the name &quot;Stateira&quot;.

== In the Book of Esther ==
In the Book of Esther, Vashti is the first wife of King Ahasuerus. While the king holds a magnificent banquet for his princes, nobles and servants, she holds a separate banquet for the women. On the seventh day of the banquet, when the king&#x27;s heart was &quot;merry with wine&quot;, the king orders his seven chamberlains to summon Vashti to come before him and his guests wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty. Vashti refuses to come, and the king becomes angry. He asks his advisers how Vashti should be punished for her disobedience. His adviser Memucan tells him that Vashti has wronged not only the king, but also all of the husbands of Persia, whose wives may be encouraged by Vashti&#x27;s actions to disobey. Memucan encourages Ahasuerus to dismiss Vashti and find another queen. Ahasuerus takes Memucan&#x27;s advice, and sends letters to all of the provinces that men should dominate in their households. Ahasuerus subsequently chooses Esther as his queen to replace Vashti.

King Ahasuerus&#x27;s command for the appearance of Queen Vashti is interpreted by several midrashic sources as an order to appear unclothed for the attendees of the king&#x27;s banquet.

== Historical identification ==

Because the text lacks any references to known events, some historians believe that the narrative of &quot;Esther&quot; is fictional, and the name Ahasuerus is used to refer to a fictionalized Xerxes I, in order to provide an aetiology for Purim. Some historians additionally argue that, because the Persian kings did not marry outside a handful of Persian noble families, it is unlikely that there was a Jewish queen Esther and that in any case the historical Xerxes&#x27;s queen was Amestris. That being said, many Jews believe the story to be a true historical event, especially Persian Jews who have a close relationship to Esther. In the Septuagint, the &quot;Book of Esther&quot; refers to this king as &#x27;Artaxerxes&#x27; ().

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bible commentators attempted to identify Vashti with Persian queens mentioned by the Greek historians. Traditional sources identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes II of Persia. Jacob Hoschander, supporting the traditional identification, suggested that Vashti may be identical to a wife of Artaxerxes mentioned by Plutarch, named Stateira. Upon the discovery of the equivalence of the names Ahasuerus and Xerxes, some Bible commentators began to identify Ahasuerus with Xerxes I and Vashti with the wife named Amestris mentioned by Herodotus.

== In the Midrash ==
According to the Midrash, Vashti was the great-granddaughter of King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, the granddaughter of King Amel-Marduk and the daughter of King Belshazzar. During Vashti&#x27;s father&#x27;s rule, mobs of Medes and Persians attacked. They murdered Belshazzar that night. Vashti, unknowing of her father&#x27;s death, ran to her father&#x27;s quarters. There she was kidnapped by King Darius of Persia. But Darius took pity on her and gave her to his son, Ahasuerus, to marry.

Based on Vashti&#x27;s descent from a King who was responsible for the destruction of the temple as well as on her unhappy fate, the Midrash presents Vashti as wicked and vain. Since Vashti is ordered to appear before the king on the seventh day of the feast, the rabbis argued that Vashti enslaved Jewish women and forced them to work on the Sabbath. They attribute her unwillingness to appear before the king and his drinking partners not to modesty, but rather to an affliction with a disfiguring illness. One account relates that she suffered from leprosy, while another states that the angel Gabriel came and &quot;fixed a tail on her.&quot; The latter possibility is often interpreted as &quot;a euphemism for a miraculous transformation to male anatomy.&quot;

According to the Midrashic account, Vashti was a clever politician, and the ladies&#x27; banquet that she held in parallel to Ahasuerus&#x27; banquet represented an astute political maneuver. Since the noble women of the kingdom would be present at her banquet, she would have control of a valuable group of hostages in case a coup d&#x27;état occurred during the king&#x27;s feast.

R. Abba b. Kahana says Vashti was no more modest than Ahasuerus. R. Papa quotes a popular proverb: &quot;He between the old calabashes, and she between the young ones&quot;; i.e., a faithless husband makes a faithless wife. According to R. Jose b. Ḥanina, Vashti declined the invitation because she had become a leper (Meg. 12b; Yalḳ., l.c.). Ahasuerus was &quot;very wroth, and his anger burned in him&quot; (Esth. i. 12) as the result of the insulting message which Vashti sent him: &quot;Thou art the son of my father&#x27;s stableman. My grandfather [Belshazzar] could drink before the thousand [Dan. v. 1]; but that person [Ahasuerus] quickly becomes intoxicated&quot; (Meg. l.c.). Vashti was justly punished for enslaving young Jewish women and compelling them to work nude on the Sabbath (ib.).

== As a feminist icon ==

Vashti&#x27;s refusal to obey the summons of her drunken husband has been admired as heroic in many feminist interpretations of the Book of Esther. Early feminists admired Vashti&#x27;s principle and courage. Harriet Beecher Stowe called Vashti&#x27;s disobedience the &quot;first stand for woman&#x27;s rights.&quot; Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote that Vashti &quot;added new glory to [her] day and generation...by her disobedience; for &#x27;Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.

Some more recent feminist interpreters of the Book of Esther compare Vashti&#x27;s character and actions favorably to those of her successor, Esther, who is traditionally viewed as the heroine of the Purim story. Michele Landsberg, a Canadian Jewish feminist, writes: &quot;Saving the Jewish people was important, but at the same time [Esther&#x27;s] whole submissive, secretive way of being was the absolute archetype of 1950s womanhood. It repelled me. I thought, &#x27;Hey, what&#x27;s wrong with Vashti? She had dignity. She had self-respect. She said: &#x27;I&#x27;m not going to dance for you and your pals.

<doc id="964161" wikidata="Q1144872" url="?curid=964161" title="Modulus of continuity">
<text>In mathematical analysis, a modulus of continuity is a function ω : [0, ∞] → [0, ∞] used to measure quantitatively the uniform continuity of functions. So, a function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;I&quot; → R admits ω as a modulus of continuity if
:formula_1
for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the domain of &quot;f&quot;. Since moduli of continuity are required to be infinitesimal at 0, a function turns out to be uniformly continuous if and only if it admits a modulus of continuity. Moreover, relevance to the notion is given by the fact that sets of functions sharing the same modulus of continuity are exactly equicontinuous families. For instance, the modulus ω(&quot;t&quot;) := &quot;kt&quot; describes the k-Lipschitz functions, the moduli ω(&quot;t&quot;) := &quot;kt&quot;α describe the Hölder continuity, the modulus ω(&quot;t&quot;) := &quot;kt&quot;(|log &quot;t&quot;|+1) describes the almost Lipschitz class, and so on. In general, the role of ω is to fix some explicit functional dependence of ε on δ in the (ε, δ) definition of uniform continuity. The same notions generalize naturally to functions between metric spaces. Moreover, a suitable local version of these notions allows to describe quantitatively the continuity at a point in terms of moduli of continuity.

A special role is played by concave moduli of continuity, especially in connection with extension properties, and with approximation of uniformly continuous functions. For a function between metric spaces, it is equivalent to admit a modulus of continuity that is either concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear (in the sense of growth). Actually, the existence of such special moduli of continuity for a uniformly continuous function is always ensured whenever the domain is either a compact, or a convex subset of a normed space. However, a uniformly continuous function on a general metric space admits a concave modulus of continuity if and only if the ratios

:formula_2

are uniformly bounded for all pairs (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;′) bounded away from the diagonal of &quot;X x X&quot;. The functions with the latter property constitute a special subclass of the uniformly continuous functions, that in the following we refer to as the &quot;special uniformly continuous&quot; functions. Real-valued special uniformly continuous functions on the metric space &quot;X&quot; can also be characterized as the set of all functions that are restrictions to &quot;X&quot; of uniformly continuous functions over any normed space isometrically containing &quot;X&quot;. Also, it can be characterized as the uniform closure of the Lipschitz functions on &quot;X&quot;.

==Formal definition==
Formally, a modulus of continuity is any increasing real-extended valued function ω : [0, ∞] → [0, ∞], vanishing at 0 and continuous at 0, that is
:formula_3

Moduli of continuity are mainly used to give a quantitative account both of the continuity at a point, and of the uniform continuity, for functions between metric spaces, according to the following definitions.

A function &quot;f&quot; : (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;dX&quot;) → (&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;dY&quot;) admits ω as (local) modulus of continuity at the point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; if and only if,
:formula_4
Also, &quot;f&quot; admits ω as (global) modulus of continuity if and only if,
:formula_5
One equivalently says that ω is a modulus of continuity (resp., at &quot;x&quot;) for &quot;f&quot;, or shortly, &quot;f&quot; is ω-continuous (resp., at &quot;x&quot;). Here, we mainly treat the global notion.

===Elementary facts===
*If &quot;f&quot; has ω as modulus of continuity and ω1 ≥ ω, then &quot;f&quot; admits ω1 too as modulus of continuity.
*If &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; are functions between metric spaces with moduli respectively ω1 and ω2 then the composition map formula_6 has modulus of continuity formula_7.
*If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are functions from the metric space X to the Banach space &quot;Y&quot;, with moduli respectively ω1 and ω2, then any linear combination &quot;af&quot;+&quot;bg&quot; has modulus of continuity |&quot;a&quot;|ω1+|&quot;b&quot;|ω2. In particular, the set of all functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; that have ω as a modulus of continuity is a convex subset of the vector space &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;), closed under pointwise convergence.
*If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are bounded real-valued functions on the metric space &quot;X&quot;, with moduli respectively ω1 and ω2, then the pointwise product &quot;fg&quot; has modulus of continuity formula_8.
*If formula_9 is a family of real-valued functions on the metric space &quot;X&quot; with common modulus of continuity ω, then the inferior envelope formula_10, respectively, the superior envelope formula_11, is a real-valued function with modulus of continuity ω, provided it is finite valued at every point. If ω is real-valued, it is sufficient that the envelope be finite at one point of &quot;X&quot; at least.

===Remarks===
*Some authors do not require monotonicity, and some require additional properties such as ω being continuous. However, if f admits a modulus of continuity in the weaker definition, it also admits a modulus of continuity which is increasing and infinitely differentiable in (0, ∞). For instance, formula_12 is increasing, and ω1 ≥ ω; formula_13 is also continuous, and ω2 ≥ ω1, and a suitable variant of the preceding definition also makes ω2 infinitely differentiable in [0, ∞].
*Any uniformly continuous function admits a minimal modulus of continuity ω&quot;f&quot;, that is sometimes referred to as &quot;the&quot; (optimal) modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot;: formula_14 Similarly, any function continuous at the point &quot;x&quot; admits a minimal modulus of continuity at &quot;x&quot;, ω&quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;; &quot;x&quot;) (&quot;the&quot; (optimal) modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;x&quot;) : formula_15 However, these restricted notions are not as relevant, for in most cases the optimal modulus of &quot;f&quot; could not be computed explicitly, but only bounded from above (by &quot;any&quot; modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot;). Moreover, the main properties of moduli of continuity concern directly the unrestricted definition.
*In general, the modulus of continuity of a uniformly continuous function on a metric space needs to take the value +∞. For instance, the function &quot;f&quot; : N → R such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) := &quot;n&quot;2 is uniformly continuous with respect to the discrete metric on N, and its minimal modulus of continuity is ω&quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = +∞ for any &quot;t&quot;≥1, and ω&quot;f&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = 0 otherwise. However, the situation is different for uniformly continuous functions defined on compact or convex subsets of normed spaces.

==Special moduli of continuity==
Special moduli of continuity also reflect certain global properties of functions such as extendibility and uniform approximation. In this section we mainly deal with moduli of continuity that are concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear. These properties are essentially equivalent in that, for a modulus ω (more precisely, its restriction on [0, ∞)) each of the following implies the next:
*ω is concave;
*ω is subadditive;
*ω is uniformly continuous;
*ω is sublinear, that is, there are constants &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that ω(&quot;t&quot;) ≤ &quot;at&quot;+&quot;b&quot; for all &quot;t&quot;;
*ω is dominated by a concave modulus, that is, there exists a concave modulus of continuity formula_16 such that formula_17 for all &quot;t&quot;.

Thus, for a function &quot;f&quot; between metric spaces it is equivalent to admit a modulus of continuity which is either concave, or subadditive, or uniformly continuous, or sublinear. In this case, the function &quot;f&quot; is sometimes called a &quot;special uniformly continuous&quot; map. This is always true in case of either compact or convex domains. Indeed, a uniformly continuous map &quot;f&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; defined on a convex set &quot;C&quot; of a normed space &quot;E&quot; always admits a subadditive modulus of continuity; in particular, real-valued as a function ω : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞). Indeed, it is immediate to check that the optimal modulus of continuity ω&quot;f&quot; defined above is subadditive if the domain of &quot;f&quot; is convex: we have, for all &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_18

Note that as an immediate consequence, any uniformly continuous function on a convex subset of a normed space has a sublinear growth: there are constants &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; such that |&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)| ≤ &quot;a&quot;|&quot;x&quot;|+&quot;b&quot; for all &quot;x&quot;. However, a uniformly continuous function on a general metric space admits a concave modulus of continuity if and only if the ratios formula_19 are uniformly bounded for all pairs (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;′) with distance bounded away from zero; this condition is certainly satisfied by any bounded uniformly continuous function; hence in particular, by any continuous function on a compact metric space.

===Sublinear moduli, and bounded perturbations from Lipschitz===
A sublinear modulus of continuity can easily be found for any uniformly continuous function which is a bounded perturbation of a Lipschitz function: if &quot;f&quot; is a uniformly continuous function with modulus of continuity ω, and &quot;g&quot; is a &quot;k&quot; Lipschitz function with uniform distance &quot;r&quot; from &quot;f&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; admits the sublinear module of continuity min{ω(&quot;t&quot;), 2&quot;r&quot;+&quot;kt&quot;}. Conversely, at least for real-valued functions, any special uniformly continuous function is a bounded, uniformly continuous perturbation of some Lipschitz function; indeed more is true as shown below (Lipschitz approximation).

===Subadditive moduli, and extendibility===
The above property for uniformly continuous function on convex domains admits a sort of converse at least in the case of real-valued functions: that is, every special uniformly continuous real-valued function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → R defined on a metric space &quot;X&quot;, which is a metric subspace of a normed space &quot;E&quot;, admits extensions over &quot;E&quot; that preserves any subadditive modulus ω of &quot;f&quot;. The least and the greatest of such extensions are respectively:

:formula_20

As remarked, any subadditive modulus of continuity is uniformly continuous: in fact, it admits itself as a modulus of continuity. Therefore, &quot;f&quot;∗ and &quot;f*&quot; are respectively inferior and superior envelopes of ω-continuous families; hence still ω-continuous. Incidentally, by the Kuratowski embedding any metric space is isometric to a subset of a normed space. Hence, special uniformly continuous real-valued functions are essentially the restrictions of uniformly continuous functions on normed spaces. In particular, this construction provides a quick proof of the Tietze extension theorem on compact metric spaces. However, for mappings with values in more general Banach spaces than R, the situation is quite more complicated; the first non-trivial result in this direction is the Kirszbraun theorem.

===Concave moduli and Lipschitz approximation===
Every special uniformly continuous real-valued function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → R defined on the metric space &quot;X&quot; is uniformly approximable by means of Lipschitz functions. Moreover, the speed of convergence in terms of the Lipschitz constants of the approximations is strictly related to the modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot;. Precisely, let ω be the minimal concave modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot;, which is
:formula_21
Let δ(&quot;s&quot;) be the uniform distance between the function &quot;f&quot; and the set Lip&quot;s&quot; of all Lipschitz real-valued functions on &quot;C&quot; having Lipschitz constant &quot;s&quot; :
:formula_22
Then the functions ω(&quot;t&quot;) and δ(&quot;s&quot;) can be related with each other via a Legendre transformation: more precisely, the functions 2δ(&quot;s&quot;) and −ω(−&quot;t&quot;) (suitably extended to +∞ outside their domains of finiteness) are a pair of conjugated convex functions, for

:formula_23
:formula_24

Since ω(&quot;t&quot;) = o(1) for &quot;t&quot; → 0+, it follows that δ(&quot;s&quot;) = o(1) for &quot;s&quot; → +∞, that exactly means that &quot;f&quot; is uniformly approximable by Lipschitz functions. Correspondingly, an optimal approximation is given by the functions
:formula_25
each function &quot;fs&quot; has Lipschitz constant &quot;s&quot; and
:formula_26
in fact, it is the greatest &quot;s&quot;-Lipschitz function that realize the distance δ(&quot;s&quot;). For example, the α-Hölder real-valued functions on a metric space are characterized as those functions that can be uniformly approximated by &quot;s&quot;-Lipschitz functions with speed of convergence formula_27 while the almost Lipschitz functions are characterized by an exponential speed of convergence formula_28

==Examples of use==
*Let &quot;f&quot; : [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → R a continuous function. In the proof that &quot;f&quot; is Riemann integrable, one usually bounds the distance between the upper and lower Riemann sums with respect to the Riemann partition &quot;P&quot; := {&quot;t&quot;0, ..., &quot;tn&quot;} in terms of the modulus of continuity of &quot;f&quot; and the mesh of the partition &quot;P&quot; (which is the number formula_29) formula_30
*For an example of use in the Fourier series, see Dini test.

==History==
Steffens (2006, p. 160) attributes the first usage of omega for the modulus of continuity to Lebesgue (1909, p. 309/p. 75) where omega refers to the oscillation of a Fourier transform. De la Vallée Poussin (1919, pp. 7-8) mentions both names (1) &quot;modulus of continuity&quot; and (2) &quot;modulus of oscillation&quot; and then concludes &quot;but we choose (1) to draw attention to the usage we will make of it&quot;.

==The translation group of &quot;Lp&quot; functions, and moduli of continuity &quot;Lp&quot;.==
Let 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot;; let &quot;f&quot; : R&quot;n&quot; → R a function of class &quot;Lp&quot;, and let &quot;h&quot; ∈ R&quot;n&quot;. The &quot;h&quot;-translation of &quot;f&quot;, the function defined by (τ&quot;h&quot;&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) := &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;−&quot;h&quot;), belongs to the &quot;Lp&quot; class; moreover, if 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, then as ǁ&quot;h&quot;ǁ → 0 we have:

:formula_31

Therefore, since translations are in fact linear isometries, also

:formula_32

as ǁ&quot;h&quot;ǁ → 0, uniformly on &quot;v&quot; ∈ R&quot;n&quot;.

In other words, the map &quot;h&quot; → τ&quot;h&quot; defines a strongly continuous group of linear isometries of &quot;Lp&quot;. In the case &quot;p&quot; = ∞ the above property does not hold in general: actually, it exactly reduces to the uniform continuity, and defines the uniform continuous functions. This leads to the following definition, that generalizes the notion of a modulus of continuity of the uniformly continuous functions: a modulus of continuity &quot;Lp&quot; for a measurable function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → R is a modulus of continuity ω : [0, ∞] → [0, ∞] such that

:formula_33

This way, moduli of continuity also give a quantitative account of the continuity property shared by all &quot;Lp&quot; functions.

==Modulus of continuity of higher orders==
It can be seen that formal definition of the modulus uses notion of finite difference of first order:

:formula_34

If we replace that difference with a difference of order &quot;n&quot;, we get a modulus of continuity of order &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_35

<text>HMAS &quot;Parramatta&quot;, named after the Parramatta River, was a River-class torpedo-boat destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Ordered in 1909 for the Commonwealth Naval Forces (the predecessor of the RAN), &quot;Parramatta&quot; was the first ship launched for the RAN. Temporarily commissioned into the Royal Navy for the delivery voyage to Australia, the destroyer came under Australian naval control in 1910, and was recommissioned into the RAN on 1 March 1911, shortly before the latter&#x27;s formal creation.

After the beginning of the First World War in 1914 until 1917, &quot;Parramatta&quot; conducted patrols in the Pacific and South-East Asia, before she and her sister ships were transferred to the Mediterranean for anti-submarine operations. She returned to Australia in 1919 and was placed in reserve. Apart from a brief period of full commission during the visit of the Prince of Wales in 1920, &quot;Parramatta&quot; remained in reserve until 1928. She was fully decommissioned in 1928, stripped of parts, and sold for use as prisoner accommodation on the Hawkesbury River. After changing hands several times, the hull ran aground during a gale in 1933, and was left to rust. In 1973, the bow and stern sections were salvaged, and converted into memorials.

==Description==
The Australian River-class destroyers had an overall length of , a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at normal load. The destroyers were powered by one set of Parsons steam turbines that drove three propeller shafts using steam provided by three Yarrow boilers. The turbines were rated at which was designed to give the ships a speed of . During her sea trials, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was able to achieve . The ships could carry enough fuel oil to give them a range of at a speed of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of between 66 and 73 crewmen, including five officers. The ship were armed with a single BL Mk VIII gun in a platform on the forecastle, three 12-pounder () 12 cwt guns in single mounts, one on each broadside amidships and the third on the quarterdeck. They were also fitted with three 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes in rotating single mounts, two aft of the rear funnel and the last on the quarterdeck at the stern.

==Construction and career==

&quot;Parramatta&quot;, along with sister ships and , were ordered on 13 March 1909; the first ships to be ordered for the Commonwealth Naval Forces, the post-Federation amalgamation of the Australian colonial navies. The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company, at its shipyard in Govan, Scotland, on 17 March. She was launched on 9 February 1910 by Margot Asquith, wife of British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith; the first new ship launched for the Australian navy. Construction was completed on 10 September, and the ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Parramatta&quot; for the voyage out to Australia. &quot;Parramatta&quot; and sister ship sailed from Portsmouth on 19 September. Once the ships arrived in Broome in December, they were transferred to the control of the Commonwealth Naval Forces.

After entering Australian control, the two ships sailed to Melbourne for a gala welcome. During the celebrations, the ship&#x27;s engineering officer fell overboard and drowned. On 1 March 1911, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was recommissioned as His Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ship, although the HMAS prefix was not officially approved until 10 July, when King George V granted permission for the Commonwealth Naval Forces to be renamed the Royal Australian Navy. On 4 October 1913, &quot;Parramatta&quot; took part in a formal fleet entry into Sydney Harbour welcoming the battlecruiser .

===World War I===
During the early stages of World War I, &quot;Parramatta&quot; operated with the Australian fleet in the search for the German East Asia Squadron, then was involved in the capture of German colonies in the South Pacific region, including German New Guinea, and the consolidation of Allied occupation in these regions. On 5 February 1915, &quot;Parramatta&quot; and sister ships &quot;Yarra&quot; and sailed for Australia, where they were used for convoy escort duties along the continent&#x27;s eastern coast until November. The ships were refitted at Sydney, then sent to patrol the region around Malaya, the East Indies, and the Philippines. &quot;Parramatta&quot; returned to Australia on 17 July 1916, and patrolled home waters until 17 May 1917, when she and her sister ships were ordered to Malta.
On arrival, the six River-class ships were to undergo anti-submarine training, but were instead immediately deployed on convoy escort operations from Port Said to Malta. On 16 August, lookouts aboard &quot;Parramatta&quot; spotted the wake from a periscope. The destroyer sped to the area of the sighting, and dropped a depth charge on a submarine travelling just below the surface. After completing the convoy run, the Australian warships completed the training, and were assigned to patrols of the Adriatic. For this, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was fitted with an observation balloon. On 16 November 1917, &quot;Parramatta&quot; and several sister ships came to assist the Italian transport &quot;Orione&quot;, whose stern had been destroyed by a torpedo. &quot;Parramatta&quot; towed the stricken ship towards the mainland, while &quot;Warrego&quot; and recovered survivors and &quot;Yarra&quot; chased the attacking submarine. Apart from this, the patrols were uneventful, and on 28 September 1918, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was refitted in Greece before joining Allied forces at Constantinople. During October 1918, following the surrender of Turkish forces, &quot;Parramatta&quot; accepted the surrender of a German admiral assigned to the area. The destroyer was then used for mail runs between Constantinople and Sevastopol, Russia, until December, when she sailed to Devonport, arriving on 14 January 1919.

During her career, &quot;Parramatta&quot; received no honours or awards for her activities during World War I. Following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in 2010, the ship&#x27;s wartime service was retroactively recognised with the honours &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot; and &quot;Adriatic 1917–18&quot;.

===Post-war===
On 6 March 1919, &quot;Parramatta&quot; sailed for home, in company with several other Australian ships. &quot;Parramatta&quot; and &quot;Yarra&quot; ran out of fuel on 26 April, less than a day out from Darwin, and had to be towed into port by &quot;Warrego&quot;. The destroyer paid off into reserve at Sydney on 22 July 1919. She was recommissioned for the period 17 May to 13 June 1920 for the visit of the Prince of Wales aboard the battlecruiser , then was returned to reserve. From October 1924 until November 1925, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was based at Westernport, Victoria for use as a training ship, then spent time in Sydney, then Adelaide, before returning to Sydney in April 1928.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Parramatta&quot; was paid off from service on 20 April 1928 and handed over to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard for dismantling on 17 October. &quot;Parramatta&quot; and &quot;Swan&quot; were stripped down, and their hulks were sold to the New South Wales Penal Department and towed to Cowan Creek, where they were used to house prisoner labourers working on roads along the Hawkesbury River. The two hulks were then sold in 1933 for 12 pounds each to George Rhodes of Cowan, New South Wales, who intended to use them as accommodation for fishers. This was opposed, and the ships were sold on to a pair of fishermen, who used them to transport blue metal to Milson and Peat Islands.

On 2 February 1934, &quot;Parramatta&quot; and &quot;Swan&quot; were being towed down the Hawkesbury River scrapped in Sydney, when a gale caused both hulls to break their tows; &quot;Swan&quot; foundered and sank, while &quot;Parramatta&quot; ran aground in a mangrove swamp opposite Milson Island and was abandoned in position . In 1973, the bow and stern sections of &quot;Parramatta&quot; were salvaged, with the stern established as a memorial on the south bank of the Parramatta River in Parramatta, and the bow later placed outside the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre, at the northern tip of the naval base at Garden Island, New South Wales. The wreck and bow and stern sections are heritage listed.

<text>The Georgia House of Representatives is the lower house of the Georgia General Assembly (the state legislature) of the U.S. state of Georgia. There are currently 180 elected members. Republicans have had a majority in the chamber since 2005. The current House Speaker is Jon G. Burns.

==History==
The Georgia House of Representatives was created in during the American Revolution, making it older than the U.S. Congress. During its existence, its meeting place has moved multiple times, from Savannah to Augusta, to Louisville, to Milledgeville and finally to Atlanta in 1868.

In 1867, the military governor of Georgia called for an assembly in Atlanta to discuss a constitutional convention. Atlanta officials moved to make the city Georgia&#x27;s new state capital, donating the location of Atlanta&#x27;s first city hall. The constitutional convention agreed and the people voted to ratify the decision on April 20, 1868. The Georgia General Assembly first presided in Atlanta on July 4, 1868.

On October 26, 1884, construction began on a new state capitol and was first occupied on June 15, 1889.

==Powers and privileges==
The state constitution gives the state legislature the power to make state laws, restrict land use to protect and preserve the environment and natural resources, form a state militia under the command of the governor of Georgia, expend public money, condemn property, zone property, participate in tourism, and control and regulate outdoor advertising.

The state legislature cannot grant incorporation to private persons but may establish laws governing the incorporation process. It is also prohibited from authorizing contracts or agreements that may have the effect of or the intent of lessening competition or encouraging a monopoly.

===Privileges===
Members of the Georgia House of Representatives maintain two privileges during their time in office. First, no member can be arrested during session or during committee meetings except in cases of treason, felony, or &quot;breach of the peace&quot;. Second, members are not liable for anything they might say in session or committee meetings.

==Composition==
According to the Georgia Constitution of 1983, this body is to comprise no fewer than 180 members elected for two-year terms. Current state law provides for 180 members. Elections are held the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years.

It is the third-largest lower house of the 50 United States (behind New Hampshire (400) and Pennsylvania (203)). Republicans currently have a majority, though Democrats have gained seats in recent elections.

As of 2011, attorneys account for about 16.1% of the membership of the Georgia House of Representatives, a relatively low figure.

==Officers==

The House of Representatives elects its own speaker as well as a speaker pro tempore. Speaker Jon G. Burns was elected on January 9, 2023. Speaker Pro Tempore Jan Jones, who served as speaker following the death of Speaker David Ralston, was reelected to her previous position on that day as well. The speaker pro tempore becomes speaker in case of the death, resignation, or permanent disability of the speaker. The speaker pro tempore serves until a new speaker is elected. In addition there is a clerk of the House, who is charged with overseeing the flow of legislation through the body. The current clerk is William L. Reilly.

<text>DSLReports a (see &quot;Online Status&quot;) North American-oriented broadband information and review site based in New York City. The site&#x27;s main focus is on internet, phone, cable TV, fiber optics, and wireless services in the United States and Canada, as well as other countries (United Kingdom and Australia).

DSLReports was created by Justin Beech in June 1999. According to Alexa&#x27;s page ranking system and the WHOIS, dslreports.com&#x27;s domain URL was registered on May 28, 1999. The site appeared to go mostly offline without notice in mid-January 2025.

== History ==
=== &quot;Broadband Reports&quot; ===
In the 2000s, DSLReports was concurrently branded as &quot;BroadbandReports.com,&quot; a domain that now redirects to dslreports.com.

=== 2011 SQL Injection attack ===
Over a four-hour period on April 27, 2011, an automated SQL Injection attack occurred on the DSLReports website. The attack was able to extract 8% of the site&#x27;s username/password pairs, which amounted to approximately 8,000 of the 9,000 active accounts and 90,000 old or inactive accounts created during the site&#x27;s 10-year history. Once the intrusion was detected, stopped and the extent of the compromised accounts had been assessed, passwords for those accounts were automatically reset.

== Content ==
DSLReports rates and reviews cable, DSL and fiber optic internet services from providers all over North America. The site also runs support and discussion forums and offers online tools for testing internet connection.

=== Reviews ===
DSLReports allows its users to submit reviews of their Internet service provider (ISP), Web hosting service, digital phone service (VOIP), and more. Users may also read reviews written by others. Many large ISPs have over a thousand reviews on the site. Reviews may be filtered for the user&#x27;s location and/or connectivity preference.

=== News ===
The site is a source of internet related news and opinion, and occasionally breaks stories about broadband internet service providers, such as Time Warner Cable&#x27;s 2008 decision to test consumption-based billing with subscribers. That same year, when Charter Communications began sending letters to high-speed internet customers regarding a new website tracking policy, reports of the letters first appeared on DSLReports. DSLReport&#x27;s editors post Internet-related news and opinion items on the site&#x27;s front page throughout the day. Common topics of news items and features include wireless technologies, peer-to-peer file sharing, upgrades and new offerings from ISPs, legal issues, regulatory issues, and security issues. However, since July 2, 2018, the site has not published new articles, as its main editor, Karl Bode, was laid off due to funding. However, compilations of links to articles on other sites are published every weekday.

=== Tools ===
DSLReports is reported to have the most comprehensive package of internet and connection testing tools available.

==== Speed tests ====
The DSLReports speed test claims to be the best speed test and the first popular speed test. The speed test uses HTML5.

==== Ping tests ====
DSLReports does have a ping and jitter test.

==== Other tests and tools ====
Other tools include stream tests, line monitoring, tweak testing, packet loss testing, and many other tools. Some of these services are provided free of charge, but others require the user to purchase &quot;tool points&quot;, which are approximately $1.

== Online Status ==

On January 15, 2025, the site went offline with a gateway timeout error. While there is speculation that the site is permanently offline, there has been no official confirmation. In an attempt to recreate the site, some users have migrated to alternate forums. On January 26, a new page appeared saying that the site is &quot;on vacation.&quot; On February 1, the homepage of the site was made available, containing a notice reading &quot;NEWS: The site will be switching to read-only shortly. While that is being arranged, only the home page is available&quot;. On February 2, the site was updated to say &quot;NEWS: The full site corpus is only available (in readonly form) for 5 minutes past each hour, for members and guests.&quot;

==Community==
DSLReports operated over 200 forums, many of which focused on Internet and computer-related topics. Other forums are dedicated to general conversation, political discussions, do-it-yourself projects or regional discussions. There were over 1.8 million total registered users on the DSLReports forums. A discussion forum was automatically created for every news and opinion article posted on the front page, which allowed members to discuss the article in question. Although membership is free, the forum community allows for anonymous posting so the information or source in [anonymous] posts may be questionable as compared to posts made by actual frequent members of the site. There are also well-hidden private invitation and very controversial forums such as the &quot;meatlocker&quot; which can be seen by adding the /forums/meatlocker suffix to the website address. It is said this private area is for nude and pornographic material submitted by the moderators and special guests.

Robb Topolski, a software tester whose findings and subsequent political activities have contributed to the movement for net neutrality has contributed to the site.

== Influence ==
DSLReports has been written about or had their reports featured in &quot;CNN&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;NBC News&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, among others.

The site has been described by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as a &quot;comprehensive reference&quot; for internet services. Discussion topics on the DSLReports frequently generate thousands of comments. The &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that over 5,000 messages were posted to forum discussing a potential data cap imposed upon Comcast Corp. customers in 2003.

&quot;CNN&quot; has rated DSLReports as one of the best free online services.

<text>HMAS &quot;Parramatta&quot; (F05/DE 46), named for the Parramatta River, was a (a licence-built Type 12 frigate) of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Construction==
&quot;Parramatta&quot; was laid down by Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales on 31 January 1957. She was launched on 31 January 1959 by Lady Dowling, wife of the First Naval Member and Chief of Naval Staff, and commissioned into the RAN on 14 July 1961.

==Operational history==
&quot;Parramatta&quot; escorted Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 1963.

The ship served on patrol duties during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation during the mid-1960s. On 3 June 1964, &quot;Parramatta&quot; and sister ship met the troop transport off the Philippines and escorted her to Kota Kinabalu, Singapore, and Penang to deliver Australian military units and supplies. &quot;Parramatta&quot; escorted the former aircraft carrier back to Fremantle: the return voyage to Australia was interrupted on the morning of 23 June by the detection of a suspected Indonesian submarine: the two Australian ships performed evasion tactics for eighteen hours before resuming the voyage. Other deployments were made during 1965 and 1966, with this service later recognised by the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot;.

During late May and early June 1965, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was one of several ships escorting &quot;Sydney&quot; on her first troop transport voyage to South Vietnam. &quot;Parramatta&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; worked together on the latter&#x27;s tenth Vietnam voyage during March and April 1968. &quot;Parramatta&quot;″s third escort run with &quot;Sydney&quot; occurred in May 1971; the former carrier&#x27;s twentieth Vietnam voyage.

On 17 July 1976, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was en route to Singapore when she was diverted to Bali in response to the 1976 Bali earthquake.

&quot;Parramatta&quot; underwent a modernisation refit at Williamstown Naval Dockyard between 3 June 1977 and 26 August 1981, and visited the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1986.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Parramatta&quot;&#x27; paid off on 11 January 1991. She was sold in August 1991, and broken up for scrap in Pakistan.

The ship&#x27;s twin 4.5 inch Mark 6 gun turret, along with the captain&#x27;s cabin from time of the ship&#x27;s decommissioning, are preserved at the RAN Naval Heritage Collection Repository on Spectacle Island, Sydney.

<text>HMAS &quot;Parramatta&quot; (FFH 154) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of ten warships built for the RAN and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) based on the MEKO 200 design, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was laid down in 1999, launched in 2003, and commissioned into the RAN in 2003. During her career, the frigate has been deployed to the Middle East on several occasions. In early 2015, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was docked to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. She completed these upgrades in April 2016.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.
The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Parramatta&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 24 April 1999. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 17 June 2000. &quot;Parramatta&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 4 October 2003.

==Operational history==
In 2005, &quot;Parramatta&quot; was sent for six months service in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst, returning to Sydney on 13 April 2006. &quot;Parramatta&quot; and were the first RAN ships to be fitted with two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts; now a standard theatre fit for all RAN frigates deployed to the Persian Gulf. During the deployment period, her crew carried out 186 vessel boardings and security patrols, and were involved in training other vessels in the Iraq Coalition. &quot;Parramatta&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation in 2007 for her efforts and conduct during this deployment.

In December 2011, while deployed to the Middle East, &quot;Parramatta&quot; provided fuel and food to an Iranian dhow that was adrift off Yemen.
In October 2013, &quot;Parramatta&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

In November 2014, &quot;Parramatta&quot; and sister ship were deployed to shadow a Russian naval force operating in international waters off Australia during the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit. The Russian deployment was believed to be in response to troubled recent relationships between the two nations.

&quot;Parramatta&quot; was docked in March 2015 to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade will include the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout. The upgrade was completed in April 2016 and she rejoined the fleet in July.

During late 2019 the frigate took part in efforts to enforce sanctions against North Korea as part of Operation Argos.

<text>NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy or Sarah&#x27;s Galaxy, is an unbarred spiral galaxy about 35 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. It has an approximately 300,000 light-years long tidal tail. Along with M65 and M66, NGC 3628 forms the Leo Triplet, a small group of galaxies. Its most conspicuous feature is the broad and obscuring band of dust located along the outer edge of its spiral arms, effectively transecting the galaxy to the view from Earth.

Due to the presence of an x-shaped bulge, visible in multiple wavelengths, it has been argued that NGC 3628 is instead a barred spiral galaxy with the bar seen end-on. Simulations have shown that bars often form in disk galaxies during interactions and mergers, and NGC 3628 is known to be interacting with its two large neighbors.

The name &quot;Hamburger Galaxy&quot; is a reference to its shape resembling a hamburger, while the name &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Galaxy&quot; is thought to refer to poet Sarah Williams (1837–1868), most famous for the poem &quot;The Old Astronomer:&quot;

<text>The Georgia State Senate is the upper house of the Georgia General Assembly, in the U.S. state of Georgia. The Georgia State Senate and the lower house of the General Assembly, the Georgia House of Representatives, comprise the bicameral legislature of the state. Together, the Senate and the House maintain authority under Article III. of the 1983 Constitution of Georgia to enact laws &quot;necessary and proper for the welfare of the state&quot;, although state law is subordinate to the state constitution, the United States Constitution, and federal law. 

Like most upper houses in the United States, the Senate has the exclusive power to confirm various appointments made by the Governor of Georgia, and to try cases of impeachment brought by the House. The Senate is often considered a springboard for those ultimately seeking higher office; all of the state&#x27;s most recent governors have served in the State Senate.

==Legal provisions==
The Georgia State Senate is the upper house of the Georgia General Assembly, with the lower house being the Georgia House of Representatives. Both bodies are constitutionally required to convene annually at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta. The General Assembly begins each yearly session on the second Monday in January. From that date of convention, sessions last for 40 legislative days.

The General Assembly may call for special sessions by a three-fifths vote of the members in each chamber. Special sessions in Georgia may span a maximum of 40 days.

===Membership requirements===
The Georgia State Senate consists of 56 members, each representing a single-member legislative district of equal size with the others. State senators serve a term length of two years, with elections being held in even-numbered years. Senators officially assume their positions on the second Monday in January following their election.

To serve in the Senate, an individual must have attained the age of 25. The person must also be a qualified voter who has resided in the state of Georgia for at least two years. Unlike most states, senators are not required to have lived in their districts for a specific period of time before running.

===Leadership===
The formal President of the State Senate is the Lieutenant Governor of Georgia, who is elected statewide every four years. Other important figures in the Senate include the President pro tempore (who is elected by all members of the Senate), as well as the Majority Leader, Majority Whip, and Majority Caucus Chair (each of whom are elected by the majority of what is currently the Republican caucus).

The minority party is headed by the Minority Leader, who is elected by the minority party caucus.

===Compensation===
The current salary for state senators is $17,342. The Majority Leader and Minority Leader earn an additional $400 per month.

==Officers==
The presiding officer of the Senate is the president of the Senate. A president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, usually a high-ranking member of the majority party, acts as president in case of the temporary disability of the president. In case of the death, resignation, or permanent disability of the President or in the event of the succession of the president to the executive power, the President &quot;pro tempore&quot; becomes President. The Senate also has as an officer, the secretary of the Senate.

, the majority and minority leadership is as follows:

==Composition==

According to the state constitution of 1983, this body is to be composed of no more than 56 members elected for two-year terms. Current state law provides for 56 members. Elections are held the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years.

Senators must be at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Georgia for two years and their senatorial district for one year (preceding the election). The highest position in the Senate is the President of the Senate, a position currently held by Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones. The second-highest position is president pro tempore, currently held by Senator Butch Miller.

<text>Channel One () is a Russian state-controlled television channel. It is the first television channel to broadcast in the Russian Federation. Its headquarters are located at Ostankino Technical Center near the Ostankino Tower in Moscow.

From April 1995 to September 2002, the channel was known as Public Russian Television (, ORT ).

Channel One&#x27;s main competitors are the Russia-1 and NTV channels. The channel has 2,443 employees as of 2015.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated Channel One Russia to be &quot;Captured Public or State Managed/Owned Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==
When the Soviet Union was abolished, the Russian Federation took over most of its structures and institutions. One of the first acts of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s new government was to sign a presidential decree on 27 December 1991, providing for Russian jurisdiction over the central television system. The &#x27;All-Union State TV and Radio Company&#x27; (Gosteleradio) was transformed into the &#x27;Russian State TV and Radio Company Ostankino&#x27;.

Russian oligarch Boris Abramovich Berezovsky gained control over ORT Television to replace the failing Soviet TV Channel 1. He appointed the popular anchorman and producer Vladislav Listyev as CEO of ORT. Three months later Listyev was assassinated amid a fierce struggle for control of advertising sales. Berezovsky was questioned in the police investigation, among many others, but the killers were never found.

A presidential decree of 30 November 1994 transformed Ostankino into a closed joint-stock company, Russian Public TV (Obshchestvennoe Rossiyskoye Televidenie or ORT). The shares were distributed between state agencies (51%) and private shareholders, including numerous banks (49%). The partial privatization was inspired by the intolerable financial situation of Ostankino owing to huge transmission costs and a bloated payroll (total staff of about 10,000 in early 1995). In February 1995, the channel announced it would stop airing airing commercial advertising which was seen by network executives as a &quot;source of great irritation and disappointment&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t clear when would the law would be passed; its lifting depended on the introduction of new advertising rules. After the fallout from Listyev&#x27;s death on 1 March, Alexander Yakovlev resigned from his post as chairman, as the channel was facing an uncertain future on the verge of becoming ORT.

Following the 1998 financial collapse (which almost resulted in them becoming insolvent), the channel obtained a government loan of $100 million from state-controlled Vnesheconombank. Also in 1998, the closed joint stock company was transformed into an open stock company. However, controlling votes on the board of directors remained in the hands of structures linked to then-Kremlin-connected businessman Boris Berezovsky. Thanks to this state of affairs, Berezovsky was able to preserve control over the channel&#x27;s cash flows as well as over its editorial line until 2000.

From 1 April 1995 to late 2002, the channel was called ORT (ОРТ—Общественное Российское Телевидение, &quot;Obshchestvennoye Rossiyskoye Televideniye&quot;; Public Russian Television). It maintained the traditional programs and shows of the First Channel of the Soviet Television (RTO), such as &quot;Vremya&quot;, &quot;KVN&quot;, &quot;Chto? Gde? Kogda?&quot;, &quot;V mire zhivotnykh&quot; and &quot;Travelers&#x27; Club&quot;; the last two are no longer broadcast on this channel.

==Broadcasting==
The main broadcasting center is in Ostankino Tower, Moscow. In September 2008 the channel installed new digital audio mixing systems in their new state-of-the-art broadcast complex located in the Ostankino Television Technical Centre in Moscow. The new Channel One news facility opened in March 2008 and features advanced server technology with equipment from the world&#x27;s leading television equipment manufacturers such as Thomson, EVS, and HP. Spearheading the transition of the renovated news facilities was Okno TV. Channel One began broadcasting a 1080i high-definition signal on 24 December 2012.

Channel One can be streamed on the internet for free on 1tv.ru for viewers in Russia and 1tv.com is for international viewers.

==Production==
Channel One has produced many films, including four of the highest-grossing Russian movies after the Soviet collapse, &quot;Night Watch&quot; (2004), &quot;The Turkish Gambit&quot; (2005), &quot;Day Watch&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Irony of Fate 2&quot; (2007). It airs the Russian adaptations of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot;, and &quot;Star Factory&quot;.

==Political coverage==
A 2024 study found that throughout Putin&#x27;s reign as Russian leader, Channel One has covered him in a positive light.

In autumn of 1999 the channel actively participated in that year&#x27;s State Duma electoral campaign by criticizing Moscow mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, Yevgeny Primakov and their party Fatherland-All Russia, major opponents of the pro-Putin party Unity. Sergey Dorenko, popularly dubbed as TV-killer, was a close ally of business oligarch and media magnate Boris Berezovsky. From September 1999 to September 2000 he hosted the influential weekly program simply called &quot;Sergey Dorenko&#x27;s Program&quot; on Saturdays at 9 pm. This was especially heavy on criticism and mercilessly attacked Putin&#x27;s opponents.

In August 2000, however, his program criticized how the Putin government handled the explosion of the Russian submarine &quot;Kursk&quot;. When Dorenko&#x27;s show was in turn suspended on 9 September 2000, ORT director-general Konstantin Ernst insisted that — contrary to Dorenko&#x27;s allegations — the government had not been involved in the change. Ernst stated that he yanked the show because Dorenko had defied his orders to stop discussing the government&#x27;s plan to nationalize Boris Berezovsky&#x27;s 49-percent stake in the network.

Berezovsky claims that in 2001 he was forced by the Putin administration to sell his shares. He first tried to sell them to a third party, but failed. A close friend of Berezovsky, Nikolai Glushkov, was arrested while seriously ill, and Berezovsky gave up the shares and transferred them to Roman Abramovich&#x27;s Sibneft with the understanding that Glushkov would then be released. This promise was not fulfilled. Soon after Berezovsky&#x27;s withdrawal, the new ownership changed the channel&#x27;s name to Pervy Kanal (Channel One). Konstantin Ernst remains as general director. As of 2008, Channel One&#x27;s minority shares are held by three little-known companies namely ORT-KB, Eberlink2002 and Rastrkom-2002. Their parent companies are domiciled in Panama and Seychelles and are managed by Evrofinans Group. 

Russian television media in the Putin era have been criticised for pro-government bias. Critics charge that Channel One&#x27;s news and information programs are frequently used for propaganda purposes. As Konstantin Ernst stated in his interview to the New Yorker, &quot;it would be strange if a channel that belonged to the state were to express an anti-government point of view&quot;. The critics contend that Channel One airs a disproportionate number of stories focusing on positive aspects of official government policy, while largely neglecting certain controversial topics such as war in Chechnya or social problems. In addition, some have argued that the station&#x27;s news reports often blur the line between factual reporting and editorial commentary, especially when broadcasting stories concerning Russian government policies or goals. For example, during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections, many political observers believe the Russian government actively supported the candidacy of then Ukrainian prime minister Viktor Yanukovych over that of Viktor Yushchenko. In a 13 October 2004 news story, Channel One reporter Natalya Kondratyuk declared that &quot;the Premier [Yanukovich], as a candidate, is adding to his ratings by working on the economy and by solving current social problems; he does not use slogans; he is not criticizing his opponent; and he is not creating scandals. Yushchenko’s style of campaigning is diametrically opposite.&quot;

In another controversial example, on a 23 January 2005 broadcast, in the midst of widespread protests against a new reform of Russia&#x27;s social benefits system (L&#x27;goty), a Channel One anchor opined, &quot;you can understand, and should understand, those who went out on the streets, but you also have to understand that the old system has completely outlived its use.&quot; Later, in the same story, a reporter characterized those protesting against the reforms as political opportunists, adding, &quot;criticizing the reform is good PR.&quot; A few days later, on 27 January 2005, as the protests continued across Russia, a Channel One reporter noted, &quot;You can understand the elderly [protestors, but] repealing free [bus] fares was the last hope for public transport.&quot;

Similarly, on a 12 February 2005 broadcast, a Channel One anchor declared, &quot;The key question of the week has been: how are Presidents [Mikheil] Saakashvili [of Georgia]) and Yushchenko [of Ukraine] different? At first, it seemed the difference was only in their appearance, in all other ways, they were like characters from the film &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; for us.&quot; Critics of Channel One news argue that hundreds of similar examples exist where station news reporters and anchors insert editorial commentary into news reports, almost always to commend perceived allies of Russia or criticize perceived enemies.

As of 2006, Vladimir Pozner, Ekaterina Andreeva, Pyotr Tolstoy and Mikhail Leontiev are among the most known political journalists of the channel. On Sunday, 28 January 2006, the Channel One news and analytical program &quot;Sunday Time&quot; (&quot;Voskresnoye Vremya&quot;) hosted by Petr Tolstoy distorted the content of a speech by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko related to the Russia-Belarus energy dispute to the contrary by editing it and deleting some crucial words.

Moreover, various media reported that the channel presented a biased coverage of other events that were closely connected to Russia&#x27;s foreign policy, including the Ukrainian elections to the Verkhovna Rada in 2007, the Euromaidan of 2013-2014, and the following annexation of Crimea. The channel was also criticized for ignoring Alexei Navalny&#x27;s political activities, namely his participation in the Moscow mayoral election of 2013. Vladimir Pozner, one of the channel&#x27;s most popular TV hosts, once admitted in an interview to the New Yorker that he composed a list of people who could not participate in his show.

According to a BBC News analysis by Stephen Ennis the channel has in its reports about Ukraine&#x27;s war in Donbas &quot;sought to further demonise and dehumanise the Ukrainian army&quot;.

Channel One news reports on 16 January 2016 about a 13-year-old girl with German and Russian citizenship in Berlin who was allegedly raped by immigrants was denounced by the German police as fake. German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has accused the Russian government of using the alleged rape for &quot;political propaganda&quot;.

On 26 February 2018 Channel One used footage from multinational military simulation organization Echelon International, attempting to pass it off as authentic Syrian War footage.

On 14 March 2022, Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor for Channel One, interrupted a live broadcast of &quot;Vremya&quot; to protest against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, carrying a poster stating in a mix of Russian and English: &quot;Stop the war, don&#x27;t believe the propaganda, here you are being lied to.&quot;

===Cruelty to animals===
The morning of 12 January 2008 on the current affairs program &quot;Health&quot; () with Yelena Malysheva about Guillain–Barré syndrome, in one of the sections a rat was violently killed. Some of the viewers said, first, that this was intolerable in a program whose audience includes children and, secondly, it was contrary to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. In particular, some claim that viewing such violent and cruel scenes poorly affected the health of some children and people.

=== Sanctioned ===
On 8 May 2022, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury placed sanctions on Channel One Russia pursuant to for being owned or controlled by, or for having acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the Government of Russia.

==Visual identity==
Since its inception in 1991, the logo featured a 1 in various designs.

=== Logo history ===
Its first logo in 1991 featured a blocky &quot;1&quot;, with a significantly thinner black square outline. On 1 April 1995, this was replaced with a simple &quot;1&quot; block, with a circle outline, but on 1 October 1995, a logo featuring an italic &quot;1&quot; was launched, with the ОРТ typograph. An alternate version of the 1995 logo had blue and white colors.

On 1 January 1997, another logo featuring a golden italic &quot;1&quot; was launched, with a partial ring and the ОРТ letters now in 3 separate blocks, which was designed by Novocom, along with Igor Barbe. On 1 October 2000, the current logo was launched, featuring a &quot;1&quot; with a partial cut, on a dark blue background. The current logo was designed by ORT Design. With the renaming of &quot;ОРТ&quot; to &quot;Channel One Russia&quot; in 2 September 2002, the idents were changed to match the new network&#x27;s name; however, the 2000 logo is still used.

<text>Messier 66 or M66, also known as NGC 3627, is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the southern, equatorial half of Leo. It was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier on 1 March 1780, who described it as &quot;very long and very faint&quot;. This galaxy is a member of a small group of galaxies that includes M65 and NGC 3628, known as the Leo Triplet or the M66 Group. M65 and M66 are a common object for amateur astronomic observation, being separated by only .

M66 has a morphological classification of SABb, indicating a spiral shape with a weak bar feature and loosely wound arms. The isophotal axis ratio is 0.32, indicating that it is being viewed at an angle. M66 is receding from us with a heliocentric radial velocity of . It lies 31 million light-years away and is about 95 thousand light-years across with striking dust lanes and bright star clusters along sweeping spiral arms.

Gravitational interaction from its past encounter with neighboring NGC 3628 has resulted in an extremely high central mass concentration; a high molecular to atomic mass ratio; and a resolved non-rotating clump of H I material apparently removed from one of the spiral arms. The latter feature shows up visually as an extremely prominent and unusual spiral arm and dust lane structures as originally noted in the &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot;.

==Supernovae==
Five supernovae have been observed in M66:
* SN 1973R (type II, mag. 14.5) was discovered by Leonida Rosino on 19 December 1973.
* SN 1989B (type Ia, mag. 13) was discovered by Robert Evans on 30 January 1989.
* SN 1997bs (type uncertain, mag. 17) was discovered by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) on 15 April 1997. This event was initially classified as a type IIn supernova, but more recent analysis suggests that it is instead either a luminous blue variable or a &quot;gap&quot; transient.
* SN 2009hd (type II, mag. 15.8) was discovered by Libert (Berto) Monard on 2 July 2009.
* SN 2016cok (type IIP, mag. 16.6) was discovered by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae on 28 May 2016.

<doc id="964177" wikidata="Q552787" url="?curid=964177" title="Maurer–Cartan form">
<text>In mathematics, the Maurer–Cartan form for a Lie group is a distinguished differential one-form on that carries the basic infinitesimal information about the structure of . It was much used by Élie Cartan as a basic ingredient of his method of moving frames, and bears his name together with that of Ludwig Maurer.

As a one-form, the Maurer–Cartan form is peculiar in that it takes its values in the Lie algebra associated to the Lie group . The Lie algebra is identified with the tangent space of at the identity, denoted . The Maurer–Cartan form is thus a one-form defined globally on , that is, a linear mapping of the tangent space at each into . It is given as the pushforward of a vector in along the left-translation in the group:
:formula_1

==Motivation and interpretation==

A Lie group acts on itself by multiplication under the mapping
:formula_2
A question of importance to Cartan and his contemporaries was how to identify a principal homogeneous space of . That is, a manifold identical to the group , but without a fixed choice of unit element. This motivation came, in part, from Felix Klein&#x27;s Erlangen programme where one was interested in a notion of symmetry on a space, where the symmetries of the space were transformations forming a Lie group. The geometries of interest were homogeneous spaces , but usually without a fixed choice of origin corresponding to the coset .

A principal homogeneous space of is a manifold abstractly characterized by having a free and transitive action of on . The Maurer–Cartan form gives an appropriate &quot;infinitesimal&quot; characterization of the principal homogeneous space. It is a one-form defined on satisfying an integrability condition known as the Maurer–Cartan equation. Using this integrability condition, it is possible to define the exponential map of the Lie algebra and in this way obtain, locally, a group action on .

==Construction==

===Intrinsic construction===
Let be the tangent space of a Lie group at the identity (its Lie algebra). acts on itself by left translation
:formula_3
such that for a given we have

:formula_4

and this induces a map of the tangent bundle to itself:
formula_5
A left-invariant vector field is a section of such that 

:formula_6

The Maurer–Cartan form is a -valued one-form on defined on vectors by the formula

: formula_7

===Extrinsic construction===

If is embedded in by a matrix valued mapping , then one can write explicitly as

:formula_8

In this sense, the Maurer–Cartan form is always the left logarithmic derivative of the identity map of .

===Characterization as a connection===
If we regard the Lie group as a principal bundle over a manifold consisting of a single point then the Maurer–Cartan form can also be characterized abstractly as the unique principal connection on the principal bundle . Indeed, it is the unique valued -form on satisfying

:# formula_9
:# formula_10

where is the pullback of forms along the right-translation in the group and is the adjoint action on the Lie algebra.

==Properties==
If is a left-invariant vector field on , then is constant on . Furthermore, if and are both left-invariant, then

:formula_11

where the bracket on the left-hand side is the Lie bracket of vector fields, and the bracket on the right-hand side is the bracket on the Lie algebra . (This may be used as the definition of the bracket on .) These facts may be used to establish an isomorphism of Lie algebras

:formula_12

By the definition of the exterior derivative, if and are arbitrary vector fields then

:formula_13

Here is the -valued function obtained by duality from pairing the one-form with the vector field , and is the Lie derivative of this function along . Similarly is the Lie derivative along of the -valued function .

In particular, if and are left-invariant, then

:formula_14

so

:formula_15

but the left-invariant fields span the tangent space at any point (the push-forward of a basis in under a diffeomorphism is still a basis), so the equation is true for any pair of vector fields and . This is known as the Maurer–Cartan equation. It is often written as

:formula_16

Here denotes the bracket of Lie algebra-valued forms.

==Maurer–Cartan frame==
One can also view the Maurer–Cartan form as being constructed from a Maurer–Cartan frame. Let be a basis of sections of consisting of left-invariant vector fields, and be the dual basis of sections of such that , the Kronecker delta. Then is a Maurer–Cartan frame, and is a Maurer–Cartan coframe.

Since is left-invariant, applying the Maurer–Cartan form to it simply returns the value of at the identity. Thus . Thus, the Maurer–Cartan form can be written
Suppose that the Lie brackets of the vector fields are given by
:formula_17
The quantities are the structure constants of the Lie algebra (relative to the basis ). A simple calculation, using the definition of the exterior derivative , yields
:formula_18
so that by duality
^i\theta^j\wedge\theta^k.&lt;/math&gt;|}}
This equation is also often called the Maurer–Cartan equation. To relate it to the previous definition, which only involved the Maurer–Cartan form , take the exterior derivative of :
:formula_19
The frame components are given by
:formula_20
which establishes the equivalence of the two forms of the Maurer–Cartan equation.

==On a homogeneous space==
Maurer–Cartan forms play an important role in Cartan&#x27;s method of moving frames. In this context, one may view the Maurer–Cartan form as a defined on the tautological principal bundle associated with a homogeneous space. If is a closed subgroup of , then is a smooth manifold of dimension . The quotient map induces the structure of an -principal bundle over . The Maurer–Cartan form on the Lie group yields a flat Cartan connection for this principal bundle. In particular, if }, then this Cartan connection is an ordinary connection form, and we have
:formula_21
which is the condition for the vanishing of the curvature.

In the method of moving frames, one sometimes considers a local section of the tautological bundle, say . (If working on a submanifold of the homogeneous space, then need only be a local section over the submanifold.) The pullback of the Maurer–Cartan form along defines a non-degenerate -valued -form over the base. The Maurer–Cartan equation implies that
:formula_22

Moreover, if and are a pair of local sections defined, respectively, over open sets and , then they are related by an element of in each fibre of the bundle:
:formula_23
The differential of gives a compatibility condition relating the two sections on the overlap region:
:formula_24
where is the Maurer–Cartan form on the group .

A system of non-degenerate -valued -forms defined on open sets in a manifold , satisfying the Maurer–Cartan structural equations and the compatibility conditions endows the manifold locally with the structure of the homogeneous space . In other words, there is locally a diffeomorphism of into the homogeneous space, such that is the pullback of the Maurer–Cartan form along some section of the tautological bundle. This is a consequence of the existence of primitives of the Darboux derivative.

<text>Bulgaria Air () is the flag carrier airline of Bulgaria, with its headquarters at Vasil Levski Sofia Airport in Sofia. The company is owned by Chimimport AD and is a leader in terms of local market share. The airline operates short and medium haul aircraft to destinations in Europe and the Middle East. Focus cities in Bulgaria are Burgas and Varna. In 2018, the company carried a total of 1.267 million passengers on 5,995 flights.

==History==

The airline was established in 2002 as a successor to the insolvent Balkan Bulgarian Airlines and commenced operations on 4 December that year. By order of the Minister of Transport and Communications, it was declared the national flag carrier in November 2002. Bulgaria Air began operations using the name Balkan Air Tour. The airline was known by that name for just a short period of time. The name &quot;Bulgaria Air&quot; and the initial logo were determined in a public competition. Bulgaria Air was privatised in 2006. Although it was rumoured that the government wanted to sell the carrier to a major foreign investor, a group of locally owned companies (led by Hemus Air) emerged as the buyer, with Italian airline Air One being the only other contender. Hemus Air reportedly paid €6.6 million and promised to invest a further €86 million over the next five years. Since then, all flights and operations of Hemus Air and its subsidiary Viaggio Air are under the name and management of the merged company, Bulgaria Air.

In November 2008, Bulgaria Air became a full member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In mid-2011 Bulgaria Air announced that they had completed a thorough analysis of its routes and had decided to acquire the new Embraer 190 aircraft. The delivery of the first new Embraer 190 aircraft occurred in March 2012. In February 2020, the airline’s CEO Yanko Georgiev stated that the carrier was in talks with two aircraft manufacturers to place an order for a single-aisle jet. They plan to order 5-6 of these aircraft to modernise their fleet and to extend their network with more aircraft available.

==Corporate affairs==
===Bul Air===
Bul Air is the charter brand of Bulgaria Air. The company was founded in 1954, but after merging with the Bulgarian national carrier, TABSO became part of &quot;Balkan Bulgarian Airlines&quot;. In 2015, the company was revived by Bulgaria Air.

===Frequent flyer program===
Fly More is the name of the Bulgaria Air frequent flyer program. There are three levels of membership: Basic, Silver and Gold Privilege. Central Cooperative Bank issues Visa Classic and Visa Gold co-branded credit cards with Bulgaria Air.

===Livery===
In November 2002, public contests were held in Bulgaria to determine a name and logo for the new airline. Thousands of people showed their creativity and voiced their opinions. After searching through the submissions, the name and logo were chosen. The design was used for about four years, until 2006, when an improved, more professional design was introduced. After the full fleet integration of Hemus Air and Viaggio Air, a new livery had to be developed once again. In mid-2010, the first Bulgaria Air Airbus A319 was rolled out wearing the finalised colour scheme.

===Catering===
In 2010, Bulgaria Air and LSG Sky Chefs created a new airline catering company called Silver Wings. The total investment for Bulgaria Air totaled $1.3 million. Future investment plans envision a new canteen to serve the airport staff at Vasil Levski Sofia Airport.

===Media===
&quot;Bulgaria On Air: The In-Flight Magazine&quot; - Bulgaria Air&#x27;s in-flight magazine. Its first edition was in 2003. In April 2011, the in-flight magazine was extended with an edition which is distributed in some hotels and shopping centres, &quot;Bulgaria On Air: The Business Magazine&quot;.

<text>Samuel Eells (1810–1842) was a 19th-century American lawyer, philosopher, essayist, and orator who founded the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York.

==Early life and education==
Eells was born in Westmoreland, New York, in the rural western part of the state, in 1810. He could trace his family back to early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and his father was a Congregationalist missionary who worked amongst the Native Americans in Western New York. He was educated at home, probably primarily by his mother, before attending the nearby Clinton Academy and finally Hamilton College.

Eells&#x27; constitution was feeble, and through all of his short life he struggled with tuberculosis and possibly other illnesses. Nevertheless, he was known amongst his friends and colleagues for his intense intellectual curiosity, drive, and &quot;personal magnetism.&quot; Besides his praiseworthy writing and oration, he often undertook seemingly impossible projects; for example, before going to Hamilton, in order to improve his health, he traveled on foot from Maryland to Massachusetts, then sailed to Newfoundland and back, paying for his passage by fishing.

==Origins of Alpha Delta Phi==
Samuel Eells studied at Hamilton College from 1828 to 1832, a time when both the college and American society were in turmoil. The college was nearly bankrupt due to mismanagement, and the student body was torn apart by rivalries between underground debating and literary societies, primarily the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian. College life at the time was intensely supervised and instruction was rigidly traditionalist. Eells saw the virtue of the debating societies as a haven for free thought, association and intellectual cultivation, yet he deplored their vicious competition for members and social dominance.

In 1832, Eells gathered five students to form a new society, Alpha Delta Phi, which would cultivate intellectual debate and development in the manner of the existing literary societies, but put aside their social competitiveness. It would seek to develop the &quot;entire man,&quot; &quot;moral, social and intellectual,&quot; and create a community of caring and brotherhood. In writing the constitution and &quot;ideals&quot; for Alpha Delta Phi, Eells and his cohorts drew on the previously existing debate and literary societies, the few previously existing Greek-letter fraternities such as Sigma Phi and Kappa Alpha, liberal Protestant philosophy, the Enlightenment philosophy and traditions of the Freemasons, and the very early stirrings of Transcendentalist philosophy, which would become very influential later in the 1830s.

Alpha Delta Phi was the second Greek-letter fraternity at Hamilton College, behind Sigma Phi, and as it founded more chapters, it also became the first fraternity at Harvard, Brown University, and several other institutions. When it founded a chapter at Miami University in Ohio, it became the first Greek-letter fraternity west of the Alleghenies, and the first anywhere outside of New York and New England.

==Subsequent career and philosophy==
After graduating from Hamilton, Eells moved to Ohio, where his father had already gone in the intervening years. On the way, he had a nearly fatal bout with cholera, but surprised nearly everyone by surviving and recovering. Once in Ohio, he supported himself by teaching at a small school that he founded himself. He studied law on his own, passed the Ohio bar exam, and began practicing on his own in Cincinnati. He prided himself on taking pro bono cases for poor or unpopular clients, and built enough of a reputation for himself that he was taken on as a partner by Salmon P. Chase; Chase was a famous lawyer and jurist who would go on to become a leading abolitionist and a justice of the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, Eells was delivering noteworthy speeches and orations, especially to meetings of religious and philanthropic organizations, many of which were subsequently reprinted and preserved. His speeches and essays were fervently religious and showed a progressive, optimistic philosophy. He spoke on the value of liberal education, including the study of art and the Classics, on history, and occasionally on controversial social topics. Several of these writings and speeches can be found in the &quot;Memorial of Samuel Eells,&quot; collected by his nephew James Eells in 1873 (Cleveland, Oh., Cobb, Andrews &amp; co., 1873).

Probably his most noteworthy work is the &quot;Address to the Biennial Convention of Alpha Delta Phi: On the Law and Means of Social Advancement,&quot; delivered and published in 1839. Here, he argues that the general law of human history is progress. Each successive phase of human history brings greater fellowship amongst all humanity and freedom for the individual soul. Although tyranny and suffering may prevail in certain places and times, truth and freedom will always overcome them in the long run. Absolute perfection may never be achieved, but human society will always be pushed forward towards true freedom. He asserts that only spiritual and philosophical change—not material advancement or political reform—can lead to real progress; he cites the mistreatment of the Native Americans as proof that democratic government and law are not enough in themselves to preclude tyranny. Rather, Eells believes that the spread of Christianity around the world will help begin a new era of equality, justice and peace.

While the trust that Eells places in Christian missionaryism may seem naive at best, one must remember that he was raised on a very liberal, humanistic strain of early-nineteenth-century Protestantism. His philosophy is clearly influenced by his family&#x27;s Congregationalism, by Enlightenment humanism, by Hegel&#x27;s dialectical philosophy of history, and by the philosophers of Transcendentalism and the Second Great Awakening, such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller and Amos Bronson Alcott. Although his idea of unstoppable progress may seem very familiar or cliché today, at that time it was connected to a radical counterculture that was overthrowing conservative beliefs in the continuous decline of humanity.

==Last years==

After his partnership with Salmon P. Chase, Eells endeavored to practice law on his own again. This did not last very long, because, as had long been expected, his health began to fall apart. Eells tried several tactics to try to recover his health, such as spending the winter of 1840 in Cuba, but nevertheless, he died in 1842 in Cincinnati at the home of his friend S. W. Pomeroy, wracked with arthritis and tuberculosis. The middle joint of his rheumatic ring finger remains in the possession of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity as a testament to his courage and willpower.

Samuel Eells was buried in the Eells family plot in Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio. His remains were later repatriated to the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity house at Hamilton College, and eventually reburied in the College cemetery in 1999. 

==Legacy==
Though noteworthy in their time, Eells&#x27; works are not widely read today and are treated mostly as historical artifacts. Alpha Delta Phi, however, is a thriving organization. It is divided into two branches—the Society, with six chapters and four affiliates, and the all-male Fraternity, with dozens of chapters in the United States and Canada.

<text>HMAS &quot;Stuart (formerlyHMS &quot;Stuart) was a British &quot;Scott&quot;-class flotilla leader. The ship was built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company for the Royal Navy during World War I, and entered service at the end of 1918. The majority of the destroyer&#x27;s British service was performed in the Mediterranean, and in 1933 she was transferred to the Royal Australian Navy. Although placed in reserve in 1938, &quot;Stuart&quot; was reactivated at the start of World War II to lead the Australian destroyer force, nicknamed the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; by German propagandists.

The flotilla operated in the Mediterranean, with &quot;Stuart&quot; participating in the Western Desert Campaign and the battles of Calabria and Cape Matapan, defeating the Italian submarine &quot;Gondar&quot;, evacuating Allied troops from Greece and Crete, and serving with the Tobruk Ferry Service. The destroyer returned to Australia for repairs and refit in late 1941, and spent most of 1942 and 1943 in Australian waters. &quot;Stuart&quot; was modified into a stores and troop transport in early 1944, and operated in this role around Australia and New Guinea until early 1946. &quot;Stuart&quot; was placed in reserve in 1946, and was sold for ship breaking in early 1947.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Stuart&quot; was one of nine Admiralty-type (or &quot;Scott&quot;-class) flotilla leaders constructed during World War I for the Royal Navy. The ship had a displacement of 1,530 tons standard and 2,053 tons at full load. She was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a draught of at full load. The propulsion machinery consisted of four Yarrow boilers feeding two Brown-Curtis turbines, which delivered to the two propeller shafts. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Stuart&quot; could reach on the measured mile during trials. Maximum range was at . The ship&#x27;s company initially consisted of 183 personnel, but by 1936 had decreased to 167: 11 officers and 156 sailors.
As originally designed, the ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, which were augmented by a 3-inch gun for anti-aircraft defence. When &quot;Stuart&quot; entered RAN service in 1933, the ship&#x27;s armament consisted of five BL 4.7 inch /45 naval guns, a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun, two QF 2-pounder naval guns (known as pom-poms), five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), six 21-inch torpedo tubes (in two triple mountings), two depth charge chutes, and four depth charge throwers. By 1941, two of the 4.7-inch guns had been removed, five 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns and a Breda gun had been fitted, and the depth charge chutes were replaced with depth charge rails. A year later, a third 4.7-inch gun was removed, along with two of the Oerlikons, the .303-inch guns, the Breda gun, and the torpedo tube sets. During 1942, a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was installed. When &quot;Stuart&quot; was converted into a storesship and troop transport in 1944, her armament was changed to a single 4-inch gun, seven Oerlikons, three quad-barelled pom-poms, a Hedgehog, and a payload of depth charges.

&quot;Stuart&quot; was laid down by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at their shipyard in Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 18 October 1917, and was launched on 22 August 1918. &quot;Stuart&quot; was one of only four ships in her class to launch before the end of World War I. The destroyer was completed on 21 December 1918 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on the same day. The ship&#x27;s name comes from the royal House of Stuart, and the badge design depicts a Stuart royal crown and a Yorkshire rose: the Scottish Stuarts&#x27; claim to the English throne came from their descent from Edward IV of the House of York.

==Operational history==

===Royal Navy===
After being commissioned in December 1918, &quot;Stuart&quot; spent most of her Royal Navy career operating with British forces in the Mediterranean, during which time she was mainly assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, operating out of various locations including Malta. In the immediate post war period, amidst the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and civil war in Russia, &quot;Stuart&quot; was heavily involved in various operations. In 1919–20, &quot;Stuart&quot; saw service in the Black Sea as part of Royal Navy operations during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, being dispatched to Yalta in April 1919 as fighting broke out in the Crimea, and later evacuating troops from the British military mission in March 1920 as Bolshevik forces advanced on Novorossiysk. She also provided assistance to the Greeks during operations against the Turks, reinforcing the Aegean Squadron and escorting troopships during the occupation of Smyrna in May 1919, and the during the landing at Panderma in July 1920. In early 1921, &quot;Stuart&quot; was operating out of Constantinople, where the Allied forces had established an occupation force at the end of the war.

Royal Navy operations in the Mediterranean normalised after 1923, and in the latter part of the decade &quot;Stuart&quot; undertook various exercises and other routine duties as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. Between 1928 and 1931, the ship was commanded by William Whitworth. In May 1933, the ship was decommissioned. &quot;Stuart&quot;, along with four V and W-class destroyers, were transferred to the RAN as a replacement for the Australians&#x27; previous complement of destroyers: &quot;Stuart&quot; was to replace the destroyer leader . &quot;Stuart&quot; commissioned into the RAN on 11 October 1933. The five ships sailed from Chatham on 17 October, and arrived in Sydney on 21 December.

===Royal Australian Navy===

&quot;Stuart&quot; spent the early part of her RAN career operating in Australian waters, and she was decommissioned into reserve on 1 June 1938. The destroyer was briefly reactivated from 29 September to 30 November 1938. She recommissioned again on 1 September 1939 under Commander Hector Waller, RAN. On 14 October, &quot;Stuart&quot; led the RAN destroyer flotilla from Sydney; the ships reached Malta on 2 January, and were redesignated the 19th Destroyer Division, nicknamed the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; by German propagandists. On 27 May, they were merged with the 20th Division to form the 10th Destroyer Flotilla. In July 1940, &quot;Stuart&quot; led the 10th Flotilla during the Battle of Calabria. &quot;Stuart&quot; was also involved in the Western Desert Campaign, providing gunfire support to army forces. On 30 September 1940, the destroyer attacked the Tobruk-bound Italian submarine &quot;Gondar&quot;, forcing her crew to surrender. &quot;Stuart&quot; supported the 6th Australian Division when it captured Tobruk on 22 January 1941, and participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. During the battle, &quot;Stuart&quot; hit the Italian cruiser with a torpedo.
She then assisted in the evacuation of Allied troops from Greece in April 1941 and the evacuation from Crete in May 1941. During June and July 1941, &quot;Stuart&quot; participated in the Tobruk Ferry Service: supply runs to the Australian forces besieged at Tobruk. The destroyer made 24 runs before she was forced to sail back to Australia with a disabled port engine. Sailing on 22 August, the ship arrived in Melbourne on 27 September, and was docked for repairs and refits until April 1942. After the refit, the destroyer was employed on convoy escort runs and anti-submarine patrols in eastern Australian waters. At the end of 1943, the destroyer was removed from service, and during early 1944, was converted into a storesship and troop transport. After conversion, &quot;Stuart&quot; operated in Australian and New Guinea waters until January 1946.

The ship earned eight battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Mediterranean 1940&quot;, &quot;Calabria 1940&quot;, &quot;Libya 1940–41&quot;, &quot;Matapan 1941&quot;, &quot;Greece 1941&quot;, &quot;Crete 1941&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–43&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1942–44&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Stuart&quot; was decommissioned into reserve on 27 April 1946. The destroyer was sold to T. Carr and Company on 3 February 1947 for ship breaking, and was delivered to the breakers yard on 21 February. After scrapping, the keel was buried in Kissing Point Bay, Putney, New South Wales.

<text>Alpha Delta Phi (; commonly known as Alpha Delt, AD, ADPhi, A-Delt, or ADP) is a North American Greek-letter social college fraternity. Alpha Delta Phi was originally founded as a literary society by Samuel Eells in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York. Its more than 50,000 alumni include former presidents and senators of the United States, and justices of the Supreme Court.

The mission of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is to provide a comprehensive and positive personal growth experience for all undergraduate and alumni brothers: social, ethical, leadership, scholastic, community service, and literary.

==Founding==

When Samuel Eells arrived on campus at Hamilton College, he found two existing literary societies, the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian, the latter of which he reluctantly joined. Eells quickly became disenchanted with both societies&#x27; unscrupulous recruiting tactics and dispassionately small sizes and considered creating his own society which would disavow what he described as jealous and angry competition between the two. Eells proposed to select members from both the Phoenix and the Philopeuthian and found a new society of limited membership based on &quot;the loftiest of intellectual and moral ideals.&quot;

On October 29, 1832, Eells gathered four other members, two from the Phoenix and two from the Philopeuthian, to a meeting in his room. The other men were Lorenzo Latham, John Curtiss Underwood, Oliver Andrew Morse and Henry Lemuel Storrs. At that meeting, Eells wrote the constitution and he and Latham designed the fraternity&#x27;s emblem and symbols. Later in the year, other members were added.

Alpha Delta Phi was the first fraternity to establish a chapter west of the Appalachian Mountains when it formed a chapter at Miami University in 1832. This chapter preceded the formation of three national fraternities at Miami University known as the Miami Triad in the years that followed.

The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is a charter member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (formerly known as the National Interfraternity Conference; NIC). A Brother of Alpha Delta Phi, Hamilton W. Mabie (Williams College, class of 1867), was the first President of the NIC. The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity is today still a member of the NIC; the Alpha Delta Phi Society, a gender-inclusive offshoot of the Fraternity, was not able to maintain membership in the NIC as a result of its decision to admit non-male-identifying members.

Alpha Delta Phi is both a social fraternity and a literary society. As part of this focus, the Alpha Delta Phi Foundation (formerly the Samuel Eells Literary and Educational Foundation) makes educational grants and sponsors annual literary competitions, which award cash prizes.

==Nomenclature and insignia==
===The Badge===
The Badge is an oblong slab with rounded corners, displaying on a shield of black enamel a white Crescent bearing the letters Alpha Delta Phi. Above the Crescent is a green Star with a gold center, and below is the date 1832 in gold. On the back is engraved a Monument with crossed Sword and Spear. In addition, the member&#x27;s initials and surname, chapter, and year of graduation appear on the back of the badge. The Badge is only to be worn with suit and tie attire. The Badge is properly worn over the heart with the horns of the Crescent pointing over the right shoulder.

===The Crest===
The Crest, which is the coat of arms, consists of the shield or escutcheon divided vertically into equal parts of green and white. It is bordered in black and studded with pearls. There is a small gold line between the center part of the shield and the border which has no particular significance except as a line of partition. On the shield in honor point are three Greek letters, horizontally aligned, alpha, delta, and phi in gold. Above the shield is an esquires helmet in profile facing left with the visor closed. Behind the shield is a Sword and Spear, both pointing upwards and both crossed saltirewise. Flanking the shield and issuing from the scroll on either side are two gold sprays of laurel leaved in gold. Beneath the escutcheon is a motto ribbon bearing the Latin phrase &quot;Manus Multae Cor Unum&quot;, meaning &quot;many hands, one heart&quot;. The whole escutcheon is radiant, meaning rays emanate from the top between the Spearpoint and Sword and base. There is a nimbus of very fine stars around the outer perimeter of the lower nimbus. Beneath the scroll is the date 1832.

===Brothers-In-Arms Statue===
The Brothers-in-Arms statue is a unique memorial to the 2,300 men of the fraternity, of Canada and the United States, who served in World War I, and especially for the 93 Brothers who made the supreme sacrifice.

===Pledge Pin===
The pledge pin is a shield divided vertically with the left half-colored green and the right half-colored white. Rules regarding the wearing of the pledge pin are established by each chapter.

==Chapters==
In 2024, the fraternity had 33 active chapters and 2 colonies. Its regional alumni organization, the Midwest Association of Alpha Delta Phi, is more than 125 years old. Alpha Delta Phi chapter at Hamilton College is the third oldest continuously operating chapter in the North American Fraternity System and the second oldest Alpha chapter.

At Yale University, it was mostly brothers of Alpha Delta Phi who were invited to join the university&#x27;s top-ranked senior society Skull and Bones. Students at Harvard formed a chapter of Alpha Delta Phi but disaffiliated to form the independent final club, the A.D.

Alpha Delta Phi&#x27;s Dartmouth College chapter was the inspiration for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. The movie was co-written by Chris Miller and Doug Kenney. The chapter was affiliated with Alpha Delta Phi from 1846 until 1969, when it broke away from the national organization and formed an independent one, Alpha Delta.

The University of Michigan&#x27;s Peninsular chapter was founded on August 5, 1846, and is the oldest continuous Greek-letter fraternity on the campus. Authorized on June 12, 1846, by the President of the Alpha Delta Phi, William Henry Goodrich (Yale 1843), seven members were the first of the chapter to be initiated as brothers. In 1847, however, faculty at the university began barring class admission and expelling students who were members of secret societies. The conflict ended in 1852 when the chapter gained full recognition from the university, though its membership was reduced to three. &quot;

== Chapter houses ==
===Cornell University chapter===
In 1877, the Cornell University chapter&#x27;s alumni group built its first house for the undergraduates, which has been described as the &quot;first house in America built solely for fraternity use.&quot; The chapter has since moved to a different location on campus - into a house designed by John Russell Pope - but the original chapter house, designed and built by William Henry Miller, still stands.

===University of Illinois chapter===
The original chapter house at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign was built in 1924 and 1925 for the fraternity. This three-story Tudor Revival style chapter house was designed by architect Ralph W. Varney, an Alpha Delta Phi brother. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 21, 1990. The house was demolished in 2018.

===University of Michigan chapter===
The University of Michigan chapter house, known as Stone House, was the first fraternity house built on the campus. It was erected in 1883 and continued to house the brothers of the Alpha Delta Phi until the current house was constructed on the same site in 1910.

==Notable members==
The fraternity has 1,521 active members and 53,344 total initiated members as of 2024.

==1832 Foundation==
The mission of the 1832 Foundation is to solicit financial resources, provide faithful stewardship, and engage in high-quality ethical practices in support of the Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity and leadership development. The foundation aims to leave a legacy that builds leaders of good character and well-balanced men.

The Foundation is a self-governing, tax-exempt corporation founded August 1961, under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. It accepts deductible donations from Alpha Delts and others and makes grants and loans to chapters, individuals, and institutions of higher learning. The grants are intended to promote intellectual interest or achievement with qualified educational and literary programs. The Foundation has its own Board of Directors and functions independently of but in communication with the Fraternity.

==The Convention==
The convention is composed of one delegate elected from each undergraduate chapter and alumni organization, each delegate being entitled to one vote. Each August, the convention is hosted at a different location and presided over by an Honorary Chairman, both of which are chosen by the Board of Governors.

The convention hears annual reports from the Governors, approves the International&#x27;s budget, decides constitutional questions, and has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Board of Governors and the Chapters.

Between the business and leadership training sessions, Conventions are characterized by considerable socializing. Brothers from all over the continent get acquainted, swap stories and songs, and raise a glass in the spirit of brotherhood. Whether as a voting delegate or as an observer, all brothers are encouraged to attend a Convention at some time.

===Board of Governors===
The convention also elects the Board of Governors. There are eleven Alumni Governors, elected for three-year terms, and a Student Governor elected annually. The terms of the Alumni Governors are staggered to provide continuity. There are other restrictions on who may be elected to ensure that no region or chapter may dominate the Board.

The Board of Governors generally holds four regular meetings each year. One of these is at the convention; others are held at various chapter houses in the fall, winter, and spring.

The governors elect the president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. The president, with board approval, may appoint an assistant treasurer and committee chairmen, who may or may not be governors. An undergraduate Assistant Secretary is elected by the undergraduate delegates of the convention. The Board of Governors appoints Regional Directors to coordinate activities of interest to nearby chapters and alumni organizations.

==The Society==

The Fraternity is a retronym used now to distinguish the all-male &quot;Alpha Delta Phi&quot; Fraternity from the gender-inclusive &quot;Alpha Delta Phi&quot; Society (discussed below). In general parlance, the Fraternity refers to itself simply as the &quot;Alpha Delta Phi&quot;; the Society uses either the &quot;Alpha Delta Phi Society&quot; or &quot;The Society&quot;.

===Fraternity-Society Agreement of 1992===
The Brunonian (Brown University) chapter first initiated women into its local membership in November 1973, and this was followed by a proposal at the 1974 national convention to either allow individual chapters to admit women or to do so fraternity-wide. This debate was often contentious, with most chapters opposed, and some members lobbying for full admission of women, but a larger number wanting to ban women altogether or grant them some form of associate membership. In 1992, at the Fraternity&#x27;s 160th Annual Convention held in Brainerd, Minnesota, an agreement allowed five chapters to withdraw from the fraternity (the Brunonian, Columbia, Middletown (Wesleyan University), Stanford and Bowdoin chapters) and to allow those chapters wishing to be gender-inclusive to create their organization, which resulted in the legal formation of two separate organizations, the all-male Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity and the Alpha Delta Phi Society, the latter of which granted each of its chapters &quot;home rule&quot; permission to determine its gender make-up.

Under the terms of this agreement, the Fraternity and the Society would be completely separate and independent legal entities, with separate governing bodies. The two organizations were not part of the same entity and did not share membership, except for male members of the Society who joined before 1992. Both groups would be licensees who share the Greek letters and intellectual property such as history and songs. The agreement put limitations on both organizations as to where they could have chapters, and there were limitations on the Society&#x27;s use of the name &quot;Alpha Delta Phi&quot;.

===Fraternity-Society Agreement of 2017===
On August 12, 2017, at the Fraternity&#x27;s 185th Annual Convention held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Fraternity and the Society entered into a new agreement that replaced the Fraternity-Society Agreement of 1992. The new agreement maintained the original rights of the two independent and legally separate organizations to license and share the Greek letters alpha, delta, and phi, and other intellectual property. The new agreement removed all restrictions on the Society&#x27;s license to use the name &quot;Alpha Delta Phi Society.&quot; It also removed most of the limitations on where either organization could have chapters.

The Society as a national organization is gender-inclusive, and the Society continues to espouse &quot;home rule&quot; for its chapters, allowing them to determine their own membership rules. As of today, every Society chapter has been a gender-inclusive organization since at least the date of the Society&#x27;s founding (for chapters that predate the foundation) or since the creation of the chapter (for newer chapters).

<text>HMAS &quot;Stuart&quot; (F21/DE 48) was one of six s built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The ship was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1959, and commissioned into the RAN in 1963.

During the ship&#x27;s career, &quot;Stuart&quot; achieved a number of historical firsts: she was the first RAN ship to fly the Australian White Ensign, and the first major vessel to be homeported at Fleet Base West.

&quot;Stuart&quot; was paid off in 1991, a year later than originally planned; RAN commitments to the Gulf War saw several warships deployed to the Middle East, and &quot;Stuart&quot; was retained in service to boost local defence. The destroyer escort was sold for scrapping.

==Construction==
The first four ships of the River class were based on the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 12 frigate, and were intended to close the gap between ships and submarines in regards to anti-submarine warfare, following the rapid improvement of submarines during and after World War II.

&quot;Stuart&quot; was laid down by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company in Sydney on 20 March 1959. She was launched on 8 April 1961 by Bettina Gorton, the wife of future Prime Minister John Gorton, then Minister for the Navy, and was commissioned into the RAN in Sydney on 28 June 1963.

&quot;Stuart&quot; and the other River-class ships were fitted with the Ikara anti-submarine missile system: the first Australian-designed naval weapons system. &quot;Stuart&quot; was the first ship to fire an Ikara missile, during trials in August 1963.

==Operational history==
On 25 December 1966, while operating as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve, &quot;Stuart&quot; was the first ship to fly the Australian White Ensign. The Australian White Ensign did not officially replace the British White Ensign as the ensign flown by RAN ships until 1 March 1967.

From late 1968 until 1969, &quot;Stuart&quot; was designated Flagship of the RAN, while the aircraft carrier underwent a major refit.

During April and May 1970, she carried out escort duties for the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during the visit to Australia by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy in December 1974, &quot;Stuart&quot; was one of thirteen RAN ships deployed as part of the humanitarian aid mission Operation Navy Help Darwin. &quot;Stuart&quot; sailed from Sydney on 26 December.

&quot;Stuart&quot;, along with HMA Ships , , and , visited the United States in 1976 for the nation&#x27;s bicentennial celebrations.

In 1979, &quot;Stuart&quot; entered dock to undergo a half-life modernisation refit valued at A$50 million. This included upgrades to weapons and systems, reinforcement of the hull, and improvements to seakeeping and habitability. The main improvement was the installation of the Australian-developed Mulloka sonar system. Delays and cost increases meant that &quot;Stuart&quot; did not re-enter service until 1983.

In January 1984, &quot;Stuart&quot; became the first major RAN warship to be homeported at Fleet Base West in Western Australia. Between May 1984 and September 1986, the ship was deployed to South East Asia three times. A six-month refit began in February 1987, followed by a six-month assignment to the training squadron with and . &quot;Stuart&quot; returned to Western Australia in November 1988.

&quot;Stuart&quot; was originally intended to leave service in early 1991,but the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait saw Australia commit several s to the United States-led Coalition. &quot;Stuart&quot; was kept in service and deployed to South-East Asia from February to May 1991 in lieu of the deployed frigates.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Stuart&quot; was paid off on 26 July 1991. She was later sold for scrapping.

Her 4.5-inch Mk V/Mk 6 gun turret is on display at in Western Australia.

<text>USS &quot;Sea Devil&quot; (SSN-664), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sea devil (&quot;Manta birostria&quot;), also known as the manta ray or devil ray, the largest of all living rays, noted for power and endurance.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Sea Devil&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia. on 28 May 1964, and her keel was laid down there on 12 April 1966. The construction was fairly uneventful, except a short delay. She was launched on 5 October 1967, sponsored by Mrs. Ignatius J. Galantin, the wife of Admiral Ignatius J. &quot;Pete&quot; Galantin (1910-2004), and commissioned on 30 January 1969. She went under sea trials on 26 January after several finishing touches.

==Service history==
&quot;Sea Devil&quot; was assigned to Submarine Division 62 at Norfolk, Virginia. She operated out of Norfolk into at least 1977. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 4 in Charleston SC from the mid-1980s until her decommissioning in 1991. She was a 637 class fast attack hunter killer. She also surfaced multiple times through the ice in the arctic. She usually patrolled the far north Atlantic, monitoring Russian vessels and ports. It went on several submarine stalking missions, watching Russian submarines carefully. It eventually became outdated and was taken out of service for repairs in 1981.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Sea Devil&quot; was decommissioned on 16 October 1991 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 March 1998 and was completed on 7 September 1999. The nuclear fuel was stored there until 2001 and then was transferred to The Naval Reactors Facility in Idaho.

<text>HMAS &quot;Stuart&quot; (FFH 153) is an &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was built at Williamstown in Victoria, and commissioned into the RAN in 2002. The frigate is operational as of 2021.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Anzac&quot; class originated from RAN plans to replace the six River-class destroyer escorts with a mid-capability patrol frigate. The Australian shipbuilding industry was thought to be incapable of warship design, so the RAN decided to take a proven foreign design and modify it. Around the same time, the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) was looking to replace four &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates; a deterioration in New Zealand-United States relations, the need to improve alliances with nearby nations, and the commonalities between the RAN and RNZN ships&#x27; requirements led the two nations to begin collaborating on the acquisition in 1987. Tenders were requested by the Anzac Ship Project at the end of 1986, with 12 ship designs (including an airship) submitted. By August 1987, the tenders were narrowed down in October to Blohm + Voss&#x27;s MEKO 200 design, the M class (later &quot;Karel Doorman&quot; class) offered by Royal Schelde, and a scaled-down Type 23 frigate proposed by Yarrow Shipbuilders. In 1989, the Australian government announced that Melbourne-based shipbuilder AMECON (which became Tenix Defence) would build the modified MEKO 200 design. The Australians ordered eight ships, while New Zealand ordered two, with an unexercised option for two more.

The &quot;Anzac&quot;s are based on Blohm + Voss&#x27; MEKO 200 PN (or &quot;Vasco da Gama&quot;-class) frigates, modified to meet Australian and New Zealand specifications and maximise the use of locally built equipment. Each frigate has a full load displacement. The ships are long at the waterline, and long overall, with a beam of , and a full load draught of . A Combined Diesel or Gas (CODOG) propulsion machinery layout is used, with a single, General Electric LM2500-30 gas turbine and two MTU 12V1163 TB83 diesel engines driving the ship&#x27;s two controllable-pitch propellers. Maximum speed is , and maximum range is over at ; about 50% greater than other MEKO 200 designs. The standard ship&#x27;s company of an &quot;Anzac&quot; consists of 22 officers and 141 sailors.

As designed, the main armament for the frigate is a 5-inch 54 calibre Mark 45 gun, supplemented by an eight-cell Mark 41 vertical launch system (for RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles), two machine guns, and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets (initially firing Mark 46 torpedoes, but later upgraded to use the MU90 Impact torpedo). They were also designed for but not with a close-in weapons system (two Mini Typhoons fitted when required from 2005 onwards), two quad-canister Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers (which were installed across the RAN vessels from 2005 onwards), and a second Mark 41 launcher (which has not been added). The Australian &quot;Anzac&quot;s use a Sikorsky S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter; plans to replace them with Kaman SH-2G Super Seasprites were cancelled in 2008 due to ongoing problems.

&quot;Stuart&quot; was laid down at Williamstown, Victoria on 25 July 1998. The ship was assembled from six hull modules and six superstructure modules; the superstructure modules were fabricated in Whangarei, New Zealand, and hull modules were built at both Williamstown and Newcastle, New South Wales, with final integration at Williamstown. She was launched on 17 April 1999 by the wife of Admiral Chris Barrie, the Chief of the Defence Force, and commissioned into the RAN on 17 August 2002.

==Operational history==

In April 2003, &quot;Stuart&quot; was used to capture &quot;Pong Su&quot;, a North Korean-owned freighter involved in drug smuggling operations. Several people were arrested ashore as part of an Australian Federal Police operation on 16 April, but &quot;Pong Su&quot; refused police orders to sail to the nearest port. A New South Wales Police launch attempted to detain the ship, off Eden, New South Wales on 18 April, but was unable to do so because of heavy seas. &quot;Stuart&quot; was deployed to board and capture the merchantman after scrounging sailors from other ships to make up for those on leave for the Easter weekend, embarking a Seahawk helicopter, and taking onboard special forces personnel from the Special Air Service Regiment and the Clearance Diving Team. Accompanied by two police launches, &quot;Stuart&quot; intercepted &quot;Pong Su&quot; off Sydney on 20 April. The special forces successfully boarded the ship, and she was sailed to Sydney by a RAN steaming party.

In 2004, &quot;Stuart&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Catalyst. On 24 April, &quot;Stuart&quot;, the patrol boat , and the cruiser were patrolling around the Al Başrah Oil Terminal (ABOT) and Khor Al Amaya Oil Terminal (KAAOT), with &quot;Stuart&quot;″s commanding officer in tactical control of the two American warships. Around 19:00, a dhow sailed into the KAAOT security zone. &quot;Firebolt&quot; sent a RHIB to board the dhow and order the vessel away, but as the RHIB drew alongside, the dhow exploded. &quot;Stuart&quot;, away, began sailing to assist, while the Australian ship&#x27;s S-70B-2 Seahawk helicopter, away diverted to the explosion site. The Seahawk and a RHIB from &quot;Stuart&quot; began assisting survivors from &quot;Firebolt&quot;″s boarding party; after experiencing difficulty in handling the injured Americans, the Seahawk&#x27;s sensor operator dived into the water to assist. Casualties were brought aboard &quot;Firebolt&quot;, then transferred by helicopter and boat to &quot;Stuart&quot;. Meanwhile, two more dhows attempted to attack ABOT—the explosion of the first dhow was the prelude to a coordinated attack on the oil terminal—but were fended off by the facility&#x27;s Iraqi security team and detonated before reaching their targets. Three of the seven personnel aboard &quot;Firebolt&quot;″s RHIB were killed, and the other four were seriously injured. The Seahawk&#x27;s sensor operator was later awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his actions during the incident.
In February 2006, fire broke out about , &quot;Stuart&quot;″s sister ship, during an exercise off the coast of Australia. &quot;Te Mana&quot;″s Seasprite helicopter was diverted to &quot;Stuart&quot;, while the fire was put out by the crew.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Stuart&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate was one of the thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

On 22 March 2011, while operating off Somalia as part of Combined Task Force 151, &quot;Stuart&quot; machine-gunned an unmanned skiff being towed by MV &quot;Sinar Kudus&quot;, a hijacked cargo carrier operating as a pirate mother ship. The skiff was destroyed. This was the first time an Australian warship had fired in anger at Somali pirates.

On 11 April 2011, &quot;Stuart&quot; interdicted the Yemeni-flagged dhow named &quot;Al Shahar 75&quot;. A boarding party from the frigate rescued three crew members being held hostage, while the fifteen Somali pirates, who had surrendered as &quot;Stuart&quot; approached, were allowed to return to their skiff and sail to shore after their weapons and equipment were disposed of.

In October 2013, &quot;Stuart&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

In November 2014, &quot;Stuart&quot; and sister ship were deployed to shadow a Russian naval force operating in international waters off Australia during the 2014 G-20 Brisbane summit. The Russian deployment was believed to be in response to troubled recent relationships between the two nations.

&quot;Stuart&quot; is the last ship of the &quot;Anzac&quot; class to undergo the Anti-Ship Missile Defence (ASMD) upgrade. The upgrade will include the fitting of CEA Technologies&#x27; CEAFAR and CEAMOUNT phased array radars on new masts, a Vampir NG Infrared Search and Track system, and Sharpeye Navigational Radar Systems, along with improvements to the operations room equipment and layout. Work commenced in early 2016, and is due to be completed by 2017.

HMAS &quot;Stuart&quot; joined KDB &quot;Darulehsan&quot;, HMAS &quot;Sirius&quot;, USS &quot;Rafael Peralta&quot; and RSS &quot;Supreme&quot; on their way to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in preparation for RIMPAC 2020 on 6 August. RIMPAC 2020 will scheduled to start on 17 August.

The ship participated in Exercise Malabar 2024 which was held from 8 to 18 October.

<text>HMAS &quot;Swan&quot; was a of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of six built for the RAN, &quot;Swan&quot; was built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and entered service in 1916. The early part of the ship&#x27;s career was spent on blockade duty in the Far East, before she was transferred to the Mediterranean for anti-submarine duty. Apart from performing shore bombardment during the Second Battle of Durazzo, &quot;Swan&quot;″s wartime career was uneventful.

The destroyer was placed in reserve in 1920, but was reactivated between 1925 and 1927 and assigned to Tasmania. &quot;Swan&quot; was decommissioned in 1928, stripped of parts, and sold for use as prisoner accommodation on the Hawkesbury River. After changing hands several times, the hull sank during gale conditions in 1934.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Swan&quot; was one of six s built for the RAN. The destroyer had a displacement of 750 tons, was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Parsons turbines, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s three propeller shafts.

Although designed to reach , &quot;Swan&quot; was capable of reaching a maximum speed half a knot greater. Maximum range was at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 4 officers and 67 sailors.

The destroyer&#x27;s main armament consisted of a BL 4-inch Mark VIII gun, supplemented by three QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns. This was supplemented by three single 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes and three .303-inch machine guns. Later in the ship&#x27;s career, two depth charge throwers and four depth charge chutes were installed.
&quot;Swan&quot; was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at Sydney in New South Wales on 22 January 1913. She was launched on 11 December 1915 by the wife of Sir William Rooke Creswell, the First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board.

The destroyer was commissioned into the RAN on 16 August 1916, six days before construction work concluded. Her name comes from the Swan River in Western Australia.

==Operational history==
&quot;Swan&quot;″s first operation was with British blockade forces in the Far East, particularly around the Philippines, Celebes, and Malaya. On 2 July 1917, the destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean, meeting all five of her sister ships en route.

The Australian destroyers were based at Brindisi as an anti-submarine force. The patrols were uneventful, and the only action &quot;Swan&quot; saw was when she was diverted to perform shore bombardments during the Second Battle of Durazzo on 2 October 1918. On 25 October, &quot;Swan&quot; and sailed to Port Said to meet a troop transport convoy and their Japanese escort, and accompany them to Salonika. The ship received the battle honour &quot;Adriatic 1917–18&quot; for her wartime service.

After the end of World War I, &quot;Swan&quot; was assigned to an Allied fleet responsible for taking over Russian anti-Bolshevik naval units as Sebastapol. She then sailed in December with the French destroyer to report on conditions in the eastern Ukraine, although they reached their destination, an advance by Bolshevik forces caused the cancellation of the mission. &quot;Swan&quot; sailed to Gibraltar, where she, her sister ships, and the cruiser departed for Australia on 3 January 1919. &quot;Swan&quot; operated in Australian waters until June 1920, when she was placed in reserve. In 1925, the destroyer was reactivated and sent to Tasmania, where she spent the next two years alternating between operational and reserve status.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Swan&quot; was paid off for the final time at Sydney on 15 May 1928 and sold to Cockatoo Island Dockyard for scrapping in 1930. &quot;Swan&quot; and sister ship were stripped down, and their hulks were sold to New South Wales Penal Department and towed to Cowan Creek, where they were used to house prisoner labourers working on roads along the Hawkesbury River.

Public outcry opposed this use of prison labour, so the two hulks were sold in 1933 for 12 pounds each to George Rhodes of Cowan, New South Wales, who intended to use them as accommodation for fishers. Rhodes&#x27; plan did not gain government approval, and the ships were sold on to a pair of fishermen, who used them to transport blue metal to Milson and Peat Islands.

On 2 February 1934, &quot;Swan&quot; and &quot;Parramatta&quot; were being towed down the Hawkesbury River for final breaking in Sydney, when gale conditions caused both hulls to break their tows. While &quot;Parramatta&quot; ran aground, &quot;Swan&quot; filled with rainwater and capsized at Tumbledown, near Croppy Point and Wobbly Beach.

The exact location of &quot;Swan&quot;″s wreck was forgotten until 1994 When Greig Berry, a researcher/diver from the Central Coast claimed to have found it in 19 metres of water near Little Wobbie public wharf. He in turn was contacted by the DSTO and Berry showed them the site in 1996 and several sonar runs positively identified the remains as Swan. A RAN hydrography team came across the wreck while updating charts in 2001. Diving the wreck is not advised, as while &quot;Swan&quot; sits in only of water, the currents in the area flow at around , and visibility is less than .
The wreck is located in .

<text>HMAS &quot;Swan&quot; (U74/F74/A427), named for the Swan River, was a sloop of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) that served during World War II.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Grimsby&quot; class consisted of thirteen sloops, four of which were built in Australia for the RAN. &quot;Swan&quot;, one of the first pair constructed, had a displacement of 1,060 tons at standard load and 1,500 tons at full load, was long, had a beam of , and a draught of between depending on load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared turbines, which delivered to the sloop&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Maximum speed was . The ship&#x27;s company in peacetime consisted of 135 officers and sailors; this increased to 160 during the war.

&quot;Swan&quot;″s initial armament consisted of three QF Mark V anti-aircraft guns and a quadruple .50 in anti-aircraft machine gun mount for close-in defence. From 1942, this was increased to four QF 4 inch Mk XVI guns in 2 twin mounts, with a close-in armament of a Bofors 40 mm gun and six Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The ship&#x27;s depth charge load had increased to 40 by the end of the war.

&quot;Swan&quot; was laid down by Cockatoo Island Dockyard at Sydney, New South Wales on 1 May 1935. She was launched on 28 March 1936, and commissioned into the RAN on 21 January 1937.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
&quot;Swan&quot; served as an escort and patrol vessel during World War II and escorted many convoys, including the Pensacola Convoy, in Australian waters and the South-West Pacific. On 12 January &quot;Swan&quot; arrived at Ambon escorting &quot;Bantam&quot; with reinforcements and remained there until 18 January, engaging bombers during raids on 15–16 January. In late January 1942 the ship was assigned to the short lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command.

The ship was part of the escort, led by with the destroyer and , for a convoy composed of , , , and leaving Darwin before two in the morning of 15 February for Koepang carrying troops to reinforce forces already defending Timor. By eleven in the morning the convoy was being shadowed by a Japanese flying boat that dropped some bombs without causing damage before departing. The next morning another shadowing aircraft had taken position and before noon the convoy was attacked by bombers and flying boats in two waves. After the attacks the convoy continued toward Timor for a few hours with &quot;Houston&quot; launching a scout plane seeking the enemy position. ABDA suspected the presence of Japanese carriers, an imminent invasion of Timor and a support fleet lying in wait and thus ordered the convoy back to Darwin which it reached before noon on the 18th.

&quot;Swan&quot; was in Darwin the next day when the Japanese attacked the port and was secured alongside , which had a cargo that included 100 depth charges. The ship managed to get underway and contributed fire in defence, but was heavily damaged by a near miss. Three crew members were killed in the attack. The day after the attack &quot;Warrego&quot; escorted the damaged &quot;Swan&quot; through Clarence Strait. 

On 2 September 1942 &quot;Swan&quot; with departed Townsville escorting &quot;Sea Witch&quot;, , and bound for Port Moresby and Milne Bay. joined to be the escort with &quot;Swan&quot; for &quot;Anshun&quot; and &quot; &#x27;s Jacob&quot; to Milne Bay while &quot;Castlemaine&quot; escorted &quot;Sea Witch&quot; and &quot;Taroona&quot; to Port Moresby.
General Kenneth Eather, GOC Australian 11th Division, accepted the surrender of Japanese forces in New Ireland from General Ito on board &quot;Swan&quot; on 18 September 1945. From late 1945 to August 1948 she was used to command the RAN&#x27;s minesweeping operation in Australian and New Guinean waters.

The ship received three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1941–45&quot;, and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;.

===Post-war===
&quot;Swan&quot; paid off to reserve on 18 August 1950, was converted to a training ship between October 1954 and February 1956 and recommissioned on 10 February 1956.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Swan&quot; paid off for disposal on 20 September 1962 and was sold for scrap to Hurley and Dewhurst of Sydney on 5 June 1964.

<doc id="964211" wikidata="Q5630597" url="?curid=964211" title="HMAS Swan (DE 50)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Swan&quot; (DE 50), named for the Swan River, was a of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Constructed in Melbourne following the loss of HMAS &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Swan&quot; entered service in 1970.

During her career, the ship was deployed to South East Asia on several occasions as part of ANZUK forces. She was modernised in the mid-1980s, then was assigned to the recently opened west coast naval base . Following the integration of women into the RAN, &quot;Swan&quot; was the site of sexual harassment and discrimination claims, leading to an Australian Defence Force-wide inquiry.

&quot;Swan&quot; paid off in 1996, and was sunk as a dive wreck off the coast of Dunsborough, Western Australia at the end of 1997.

==Construction==
&quot;Swan&quot; and sister ship were ordered in 1964 as replacements for , a destroyer lost following a collision with the aircraft carrier in 1964. Although intended to be the same as the previous River-class ships (themselves based on the British Type 12 frigate), the design was changed from 1965 to incorporate many of the improvements of the British s. Work on the two vessels started without specifications or a contract, and the evolving design meant changes were being made as the ships were being constructed, with resulting delays and cost increases attributed to a lack of planning.

&quot;Swan&quot; was laid down by the Williamstown Dockyard at Melbourne, Victoria on 16 February 1965, and was launched on 16 December 1967 by the wife of the Minister for the Navy, Allen Fairhall. The launching ceremony did not go entirely to plan; it took 11 attempts to smash the ceremonial bottle of champagne to christen &quot;Swan&quot;. Although the ship had not been completed, she was commissioned into the RAN on 20 January 1970. She was the third ship of the RAN to be named for the Swan River in Western Australia. &quot;Swan&quot; cost $22 million to build.

==Operational history==

===1970–1983===
In October 1970, &quot;Swan&quot; sailed to Fiji, and was present in Suva on 10 October when the former British colony was granted independence. The warship was deployed to Singapore on 16 September 1971 for her first and only deployment to the Far East Strategic Reserve, which was replaced by ANZUK on 1 November. &quot;Swan&quot; operated as part of ANZUK until April 1972, during which she visited Japanese ports, served as escort to the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during a Royal Visit to Thailand, and participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Hawk. On her return to Australia on 17 April, the ship underwent maintenance, then spent the rest of the year on training exercises. After more exercises during the first third of 1973, &quot;Swan&quot; was docked at Williamstown for a refit from early April to early October, during which an Ikara missile system was installed. Sea trials and exercises took up the rest of 1973.

1974 started with &quot;Swan&quot; deploying to Hobart to serve as flagship for the Royal Hobart Regatta. On 25 May, &quot;Swan&quot; received a distress call from the disabled yacht &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;: despite rough seas and high winds, swimmers from the warship were able to recover the yacht&#x27;s crew. In October, the ship sailed to Singapore for a deployment as part of the ANZUK force, and on the organisation&#x27;s disbandment at the start of 1975, served as the Australian contribution to the Five Power Agreement. During the ship&#x27;s time in South East Asia, which ended in April 1975, she visited multiple ports, participated in three multinational exercises, and received news that she had been awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1947, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN. After returning to Sydney on 14 April, &quot;Swan&quot; spent the rest of the year alternating between maintenance dockings and training exercises. The early part of 1976 was spent performing port visits around Australia, before &quot;Swan&quot; docked at Williamstown for a refit, which lasted from May 1976 to February 1977.

During 1977, amongst training exercises and maintenance dockings, &quot;Swan&quot; participated in SINDEX 77, a multinational exercise in the Indian Ocean. After training exercises in early 1978, &quot;Swan&quot; was forced to make an emergency docking in early March because of leakage on a stern gland. In early May, the warship was tasked with finding the yachtsman from &quot;Josephine II&quot;, which had run aground on Middleton Reef, but was unsuccessful (the sailor was later found at sea by another ship). &quot;Swan&quot; participated in several major fleet exercises during the latter part of the year. On 18 January 1979, while docked alongside the destroyer tender at Garden Island, &quot;Swan&quot; was evacuated when a bomb threat was made against the tender. After port visits along the eastern Australian coast, the warship underwent a maintenance docking for the majority of the year.

In March 1980, &quot;Swan&quot; was deployed to South East Asia for five months. On 17 April the ship visited Singapore at the start of the deployment in South-east Asian waters, &quot;for the first of three &#x27;show the flag&#x27; visits. During this trip she visited 18 ports in eight countries, and also rescued 72 refugees from an overloaded boat in the South China Sea on 17 June. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Ian Macphee, announced that Australia would accept responsibility for the refugees. The warship returned to its home port of Sydney in late August, and underwent a short maintenance period before visiting New Zealand near the end of the year. &quot;Swan&quot; returned to the Pacific and South East Asia for a seven-month deployment in 1981, during which she visited 22 ports, starting in the South Pacific, travelling eastward to Hawaii, before returning to South East Asia. After &quot;weathering a violent storm&quot;, Typhoon Agnes – part of the 1981 Pacific typhoon season – in the Yangtze Delta, she became the first Australian warship to visit China in 32 years (and the first following the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China), and the first to participate in joint training exercises with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. During 1982, &quot;Swan&quot; became the only ship of her type to use the Fremantle Public Works slipway, and the first warship to use the hydraulic lift at the West Australian Maritime Support Facility at Cockburn Sound. The ship embarked on five consecutive deployments in 1983, travelling throughout Australia, Asia, and the Pacific for port visits and multinational exercises.

===1984–1996===
At the start of 1984, &quot;Swan&quot; went into Williamstown for a 20-month modernisation. During this time, the Limbo anti-submarine mortar was removed and replaced with two triple-barrel Mark 32 torpedo launchers, while other upgrades to her capabilities were made. Near the end of the modernisation, a large number of components had to be scrounged from sister ship &quot;Torrens&quot; to make &quot;Swan&quot; operational: for a time, the ship came to be known as &quot;Swarrens&quot;, as she was reputed to be half-&quot;Swan&quot;, half-&quot;Torrens&quot;. &quot;Swan&quot; reentered service in September 1985, and in December became the second ship of her class to be based out of in Western Australia: she was better suited to operating from the less-advanced western base as she was did not need the specialised technical and logistics support required by the s and s. Early 1986 was spent adjusting to operating conditions in the Indian Ocean, visiting ports along the western and northern Australian coasts, and undergoing training exercises. Mid-year, &quot;Swan&quot; undertook a two-month deployment to South East Asia. On her return, she spent the rest of the year alongside at &quot;Stirling&quot; for maintenance. Early 1987 followed the same pattern as the previous year&#x27;s start, after which &quot;Swan&quot; sailed to Melbourne for a refit in March. This was completed in June, and after returning to &quot;Stirling&quot;, the ship travelled to the South China Sea to participate in the multinational Exercise Starfish. The rest of the year was spent undergoing training exercises with the United States, Malaysian, and Indonesian ships.
1988 started with a multitude of port visits to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary Year, followed by two deployments to South East Asia, the first from June until August, the second from October to January 1989. On her return, &quot;Swan&quot; was docked for a refit; she was the first RAN vessel to use the Jervoise Bay shiplift, and the first major warship refitted in Western Australia. The refit ran until September, and &quot;Swan&quot; spent the rest of the year undergoing training exercises. After visiting New Zealand and Sydney in early 1990, the ship embarked on a five-month deployment throughout Asia; travelling as far north as the top of Japan and participating in multiple training exercises with regional navies. 1991 started off with more training exercises and port visits. In April, all of the Ikara missiles carried by &quot;Swan&quot; were removed following fleet-wide instructions to cease use of the system. Another deployment to South East Asia was made from April to August, followed by a brief visit to the region in September and October: during the latter, &quot;Swan&quot; was called in to provide humanitarian assistance following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The warship visited South East Asia again from June to October 1992.

During the 1990s, women were integrated into the RAN. The hasty implementation and the lack of preparation or education caused problems aboard several ships, particularly &quot;Swan&quot;. In August 1992, a female Reserve medical officer reported that she had been sexually assaulted by a male officer. Although the male officer was acquitted at a court martial, other claims from female personnel aboard &quot;Swan&quot; came forward, including unsatisfactory living arrangement, sexual harassment, and gender-based discrimination. The &quot;Swan&quot; incidents became the centrepiece of an inquiry into sexual harassment across the Australian Defence Force (ADF), which found that although the rate of sexual harassment in the ADF was equal to other workforces, the attitudes and traditions evolved by the previously all-male military had to change.

The ship participated in multinational exercises off Darwin in May 1993, and after returning to Western Australia, made a series of port visits along the southern and eastern coasts of Australia while en route to Sydney. &quot;Swan&quot; then sailed to South East Asia to participate in multinational exercises, and returned to &quot;Stirling&quot; at the start of December. Maintenance and training exercises were carried out during early 1994, after which &quot;Swan&quot; left to circumnavigate Australia, visiting ports across Australia and in Indonesia during April, May, and June. On her return, &quot;Swan&quot; was docked for a refit, which lasted until the end of the year. 1995 saw the ship participate in fleet exercises around Australia: during a gunnery exercise off Shoalwater Bay, &quot;Swan&quot; fired 1081 shells, becoming the first RAN vessel since 1942 to fire her entire magazine in one event. In 1996, the destroyer escort was reclassified as a training ship. &quot;Swan&quot; was used to train midshipmen during the early part of the year, then sailed to Singapore for a final South East Asia deployment before returning to Fremantle to decommission.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Swan&quot; paid off on 13 September 1996. During her career, she travelled during 56,982 hours spent at sea. In November, the Australian government gifted the ship to the state of Western Australia. On 11 November 1996, State Minister for Tourism Norman Moore announced that the ship would be given to the Geographe Bay Artificial Reef Society to be scuttled and made into an artificial reef and dive site; the first deliberately prepared dive wreck in the Southern Hemisphere.

&quot;Swan&quot; was towed to Bunbury, Western Australia, and over the next twelve months, the ship was cleared of environmental hazards (such as oil and plastics) and diver hazards (such as cabling), and had access holes cut. The engine and boiler rooms were sealed off. After preparations were completed, the ship was towed to a point from Point Picquet (Meelup Beach), near Dunsborough, Western Australia. &quot;Swan&quot; was scuttled on the morning of 14 December 1997; an event observed by an estimated 10,000 spectators on shore, plus numerous spectator craft. The actual detonation was performed by a six-year-old child, whose father had won a raffle for the honour. &quot;Swan&quot; sank quickly at , in of water, and came to rest on the sandy bottom in a nearly upright position. The wreck is marked with red buoys at the bow and stern.

&quot;Swan&quot; has been described as &quot;an instant tourism hit&quot;; A$2.4 million was contributed to the local economy through tourism earnings during 1998, and up to 15,000 dives are made at the site each year. The site is host to an estimated 100 different species of marine life. The wreck&#x27;s popularity prompted the acquisition of the destroyer and her sinking as a dive wreck off Albany, Western Australia in 2001.

&quot;Swan&quot;&#x27;s 4.5-inch Mk V/Mk 6 gun turret is preserved at Princess Royal Fortress, Albany, Western Australia. This turret is open and accessible to visitors.

<text>Santa Rosa Island (Spanish: &quot;Isla de Santa Rosa&quot;; Cruzeño Chumash: ) is the second largest of the Channel Islands of California at 53,195 acres (215.27 km2 or 83.118 sq mi). Santa Rosa is located about off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, in Santa Barbara County and is part of Channel Islands National Park.

The Chumash, a Native American people lived on the Channel Islands at the time of European contact.

The remains of the 13,000-year-old Arlington Springs Man, possibly the oldest human remains in the Americas, were discovered on the island in 1959.

Santa Rosa Island is home to the rare Torrey pine, a species of pine tree that exists only in two locations around the world.

Public passenger access to the eastern portion of Santa Cruz Island is provided by Island Packers ferry service out of the Ventura Harbor.

==Geography==
The terrain consists of rolling hills, deep canyons, and a coastal lagoon. Highest peak is Vail Peak, at .

During the last ice age, the four northern Channel Islands, including Santa Rosa Island, were conjoined into Santa Rosae, a single island that was only five miles (8 km) off the coast.

==History==

===Early history===
The ancestors of the Chumash people lived on Santa Rosa for many thousands of years, establishing numerous village sites along the coast and in the interior. Recent research has documented the presence of maritime Paleocoastal peoples on the island at least 12,000 years ago.

The Chumash called the driftwood that washed up on the sandy beaches by the channel currents &quot;wimal&quot;. The logs were used to build &quot;tomols&quot; (plank canoes).

Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo&#x27;s crew visited the island after his death, and found three Chumash villages, containing a total of 40-50 people. They called their island Wima, but George Vancouver listed it as Santa Rosa on his 1792 chart. He reported that this name appeared on a Spanish chart in his possession. Franciscan missionaries baptized a large number in 1822 and most were removed to their Mission Santa Barbara and Mission San Buenaventura by the late 1820s.

===Land grants===
George Nidever hunted sea otters for their pelts in the late 1830s and 1840s, under a license granted by the Mexican government to William Dana.

Governor Manuel Micheltorena made a Mexican land grant of the island of Santa Rosa to brothers José Antonio Carrillo and Carlos Antonio Carrillo in 1843. They gave the island to Carlos&#x27; daughters, Manuela Carrillo de Jones and Francisca Carrillo de Thompson. Their husbands, John Coffin Jones (1796–1861) and Alpheus Basil Thompson (1795–1869), entered into a partnership to manage the island.

In 1852, the Channel Islands were ceded to the United States by Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the Mexican–American War. Also in 1852, a claim was filed with the Public Land Commission, but the grant was not patented to Manuela Carrillo de Jones and Francisca Carrillo de Thompson until 1871, though a district court confirmed clear title in 1856. Then, the Thompson-Jones partnership started to come apart in 1857. By 1870, the More brothers, consisting of Thomas Wallace (T.W.), Alexander (A.P.), and Henry had bought out all of the interests, and A.P. and Henry became joint owners of the island. They transformed the island into a large sheep ranch, with headquarters at Bechers Bay.

===20th century===
The More family sold the island to Walter L. Vail and John V. Vickers in 1902. The Vail and Vickers Company transformed the sheep ranch into a cattle fattening operation.

The United States Army leased 46 acres for a radar post during WW II, and erected 16 buildings for 75 men, between Jan. and Aug. 1943. The site was abandoned after the end of the war. The United States Air Force built a 200-man, early-warning radar site in 1952 during the Cold War. At the same time, the United States Navy built a communication station on 4.5 acres on Navy Hill, to track missiles launched from Point Mugu NAS. The Air Force cancelled its lease in 1963.

Standard Oil Company obtained an exploration lease in 1932, but came up empty. Richfield Oil Company in 1938, and Superior Oil Company in 1947 were equally unsuccessful. In 1971 Mobil Oil Corporation obtained a lease and drilled six unsuccessful wells, plugging and abandoning the last one in 1975.

===National park===
In 1980, Santa Rosa Island was included within Channel Islands National Park over the objections of Vail &amp; Vickers, which then successfully lobbied to have the legislation stipulate that purchase of their land would be the highest priority of the Channel Islands National Park. Vail &amp; Vickers sold the island in 1986 for nearly $30 million. Subsequently, the National Park Service issued a series of five-year renewable special use permits. Threatened lawsuits in 1996 resulted in a settlement agreement, which included the end of all hunting and ranching operations, such that only one steer remained by 1998. Vail&#x27;s 25 year use and occupancy agreement ended in December 2011.

In 2006 U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA) introduced a provision into the annual defense policy bill that would allow disabled veterans to continue hunting elk on the island past 2011, without the consent of Vail &amp; Vickers or the National Park Service. The provision stayed in the bill and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. This legislation was repealed by the next Congress as part of the FY 2007 Omnibus appropriations bill, also signed into law by President George W. Bush.

==Activities==
Recreational activities on Santa Rosa Island include kayaking, camping and hiking. A private boat charter company offers a number of trips to the island year round, and camping reservations can be made through Channel Islands National Park offices in Ventura, California. A year-round charter flight service is available from Camarillo Airport for hikers and campers to Santa Rosa Island.

===CSUCI Research Station===
In November 2012 the National Park Service (NPS) issued a permit to California State University, Channel Islands (CSUCI) to operate a field research station on Santa Rosa Island. The mission of the CSUCI Santa Rosa Island Research Station (SRIRS) is &quot;to encourage and advance the interdisciplinary knowledge and stewardship of our natural and cultural resources through long-term research, inquiry-based education, and public outreach. (...) (and) to react energetically, adeptly, and successfully to our changing natural and human landscapes.&quot;

==Ecology and climate==

A variety of the Torrey pine (&quot;Pinus torreyana&quot; var. &quot;insularis&quot;) grows on the island. The population of this endangered species is estimated at 1000 trees. The island oak (&quot;Quercus tomentella&quot;) is native to the island.

Flightless geese, giant mice and pygmy mammoths are extinct, while the island fox, spotted skunk, and munchkin dudleya (&quot;Dudleya gnoma&quot;) (one of the six endemic plant species on the island) still live there. The island is home to one of only three known populations of Hoffman&#x27;s rockcress.

Its surrounding waters serve as an invaluable nursery for the sea life that feeds larger marine mammals and seabirds. Great white sharks, including some adults over 15 feet in length, are fairly common in the northern Channel Islands (especially San Miguel and Santa Rosa) and feed on the abundant marine mammals. It is unwise to swim or dive alone near seal colonies where white sharks may be present.

The rare endemic lichen &quot;Caloplaca obamae&quot;, discovered in 2007 and described by Kerry Knudsen in 2009, commemorates United States President Barack Obama.

Santa Rosa Island has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification).

==Archaeology==
The remains of pygmy mammoths (&quot;Mammuthus exilis&quot;), which appear to have gone extinct about 13,000 years ago, have been excavated on the island.

Archaeologist Phil Orr of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History was the founder of research on the prehistory of Santa Rosa Island. After conducting 25 years of field research here, he published the results of his work in 1968.

In 1959, Orr discovered the remains of 13,000-year-old Arlington Springs Man, the oldest reliably dated human remains in the Americas, on the island. The remains were found in an arroyo below the existing ground surface. They were carefully preserved, and were finally analyzed in 1987, when radiocarbon dating methods were improved, by scientists Don Morris and John Johnson.

Back 13,000 years ago, the site of the discovery would have been an interior island location, several miles from where the coast then existed.

The archaeologically sensitive areas of the island were listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

<doc id="964221" wikidata="Q1199703" url="?curid=964221" title="Kansai Main Line">
<text>The is a railway line in Japan, which connects Nagoya Station with JR Namba Station in Osaka. It is jointly run by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and West Japan Railway Company (JR West), with the boundary between both companies being located at Kameyama Station in Kameyama, Mie.

The section from Kamo Station west to JR Namba Station is electrified and a part of the JR West &quot;Urban Network&quot;, and is nicknamed the Yamatoji Line. The JR Central section from Nagoya to Kameyama is also electrified.

Despite its name, for much of its length it is a very local line with mainly single track sections and no regular express services. The line was originally built in the 1890s by Kansai Railway (later under the Japanese Government Railways and Japanese National Railways) as an alternate route from south Osaka to Nara and Nagoya, but competition from the Kintetsu lines and declining ridership forced the line to operationally become two electric suburban lines for Osaka and Nagoya respectively, with a less-used unelectrified rural section in the middle.

Formerly a &quot;Kasuga&quot; express train ran from to , but this service was discontinued in March 2006.

==History==
The Osaka Railway Co. opened the Minatomachi (now JR Namba) to Nara section between 1889 and 1892. The company merged with the Kansai Railway Co. in 1900.

The Nara Railway Co. opened the Nara to Kizu section in 1896. It merged with the Kansai Railway Co. in 1905.

The Kansai Railway Co. opened the Nagoya to Kizu section between 1890 and 1897, completing the line. The company was nationalised in 1907.

===Duplication===
The Minatomachi to Tennoji section was duplicated in 1903 and extended to Kashiwara in 1908. The Nara to Kizu section was duplicated in 1914, and the Kashiwara to Nara section between 1923 and 1926. In 1944 the Oji to Nara section was returned to single track and the materials recycled for the Japanese war effort. The section was re-duplicated in 1961.

The Tomita to Kuwana section (except for the bridge over the Inabe River) was duplicated in 1973, and the Kuwana to Yatomi section between 1977 and 1980. The Yokkaichi to Tomidahama section was duplicated in 1993.

===Electrification===
The Minatomachi to Nara section was electrified in 1973, extended to Kizu in 1984, and to Kamo in 1988.

The Nagoya - Hatta section was electrified in 1979, and extended to Kameyama in 1982.

===Other matters of note===
CTC signalling was commissioned between Kizu and Kameyama in 1983, and extended to Nagoya in 2001.

In 1994 Minatomachi Station was renamed to coincide with the opening of the Kansai Airport Line to Kansai Airport. In 1996 Namba Station and the approach line were relocated underground to eliminate a number of level crossings. There are plans to extend the line from Namba to Osaka Station, with construction to begin within the next few years. (See Naniwasuji Line for information.)

===Former connecting lines===
* Kamo Station - In 1898 the Kansai Railway Co. opened an branch to a station beside the Daibutsu (Great Buddha), and in 1899 extended the line to Nara. Following the nationalisation of the Kansai Railway Co. in 1907, the line was closed.
* Horyuji Station - The Kintetsu line to Hirahata operated between 1915 and 1945.
* Kyuhoji Station - A branchline to serve the Taisho airfield opened in 1942, and was extended to Sugimotocho Station on the Hanwa Line in 1952 to provide an electrified (1500 V DC) freight bypass between Wakayama and Nagoya. Passenger services were introduced in 1965 but ceased two years later, and the line closed in 2009 after being out of service for five years.
* Tennoji Station - The Nankai line to Tengachaya, electrified at 1500 V DC, operated between 1901 and 1993.

<text>The Shanghai Sharks () are a Chinese Basketball Association team based in Shanghai.

The Sharks, who share their colors with the New York Knicks, are best known outside China for having developed Yao Ming before he entered the National Basketball Association. Yao was the driving force behind their three consecutive appearances in the finals (1999–2000, 2000–01, and 2001–02), facing the Bayi Rockets each time. The Sharks were runners-up the first two years, but won for the first time on their third try, breaking the Rockets&#x27; streak of six CBA championships in a row.

In August 1979, the Sharks played the Washington Bullets, the first NBA team to travel to China, with Yao Zhiyuan - father of Yao Ming - as their center.

The team faced serious financial issues in the 2008–09 season, and were in danger of not being able to compete in the following season. On July 16, 2009, Chinese media reported that Yao Ming had stepped in to purchase the team. 

In the 2021–22 season, under Li Chunjiang, the Sharks experienced a high bested only by the Yao era, reinvigorating their place among China&#x27;s best basketball teams. Around that time, alongside the CBA as a whole, they became an Internet meme as a future landing spot for high-profile NBA stars who underperform in a game or series, particularly in the playoffs. Kyle Kuzma, Ben Simmons, and Dillon Brooks were prominent victims of such jokes.

<doc id="964228" wikidata="Q26077" url="?curid=964228" title="Razorblade Romance">
<text>Razorblade Romance is the second studio album by Finnish gothic rock band HIM, recorded with producer John Fryer. HIM initially began recording the album with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, who had helmed the group&#x27;s 1997 debut album, however these sessions proved unsuccessful, and HIM parted ways with Hiilesmaa, and recruited Fryer. The band, along with Fryer, relocated to Rockfield Studios in Wales to begin recording, and released the album on 24 January 2000. Musically, the album featured a sleeker production and a more melodic sound compared to their debut. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; would prove to be HIM&#x27;s breakthrough single, reaching number one in Finland and Germany. The song also found its way on to the soundtrack of the 1999 science fiction film &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;.

&quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, with particular praise being given to the songwriting, while the more polished production received some criticism. The album also charted in six countries, peaking at number one in Finland, Germany and Austria, later going double platinum, triple gold, and gold respectively. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; would also go on to chart in the United States in January 2004, making it the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the US. HIM also won &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the 2000 Emma Awards, as well as were awarded at the 2004 IFPI Platinum Europe Awards. Three further singles were released from the album, two of which reached number one in Finland. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; was followed by an intensive supporting tour, which nearly resulted in the band breaking up. The album was also HIM&#x27;s first to feature drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen, and the only to feature keyboardist Jussi-Mikko &quot;Juska&quot; Salminen.

==Production==

HIM began work on their second album at MD-Studios in Munkkiniemi, with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, who had produced their debut album. These sessions proved to be unsuccessful however, with Hiilesmaa suffering from exhaustion and relationships within the band going sour. Bassist Mikko &quot;Mige&quot; Paananen later remarked: &quot;Ville [Valo] would be raving in the studio, and we&#x27;d just play so we could quickly go home. You just didn&#x27;t bother saying &#x27;this sucks&#x27; anymore.&quot; HIM eventually parted ways with Hiilesmaa in January 1999, by which point they had demoed four songs. The band&#x27;s record label BMG soon decided that HIM&#x27;s next album should be recorded abroad with a name producer. The band eventually decided on John Fryer, who had previously worked with Nine Inch Nails and Cradle of Filth among others, and flew to Rockfield Studios in Wales to commence recording their album.

The first two songs to be recorded were &quot;I Love You (Prelude to Tragedy)&quot; and &quot;Poison Girl&quot;, which Fryer began mixing early on while the band left to go on tour. When they returned, the band found the initial mixes to be horrible, which they later discovered to be the doing of Per Kviman, who had been instructing Fryer on how to mix the songs. After letting go of Kviman, HIM continued recording, with Valo later remarking that the studio sessions were &quot;all in all incredibly fun&quot; . He stated: &quot;It was damn fun getting out of those familiar circles and just focus on the album, and not worry about anything else. It also felt great that the band was together all the time&quot;.

After recording finished, Fryer and Valo began mixing the album in London, and were once again horrified to find that &quot;everything sounded like shit&quot;. After spending 15 000 euros trying to properly mix the album in London, Fryer and Valo flew to Finland where, with the help of Risto Hemmi from Finnvox, they were finally able to mix the record. The initial mixes were later released on the &quot;Uneasy Listening&quot; albums as well as the 2014 remastered edition of &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; as the &quot;Rockfield Madness&quot; versions and &quot;Strongroom Sessions&quot; respectively. After finishing the mixing, the tapes were flown to Sterling Sound in New York, where they were mastered by George Marino. Valo initially wanted the album to be called &quot;Goth &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, but BMG refused, preferring the previously suggested title &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;. The cover art was designed by Janne Uotila with photographs by Jouko Lehtola, and was influenced by the style of 1980s glam rock and pop acts. The budget of the album eventually grew to nearly 150 000 euros.

==Music and lyrics==

The overall sound of &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; features less focus on guitar than the band&#x27;s debut, in favor a sleeker and more melodic sound, influenced by the music of the 1980s. &quot;I Love You (Prelude to Tragedy)&quot; was first considered for &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot;, and was thus demoed several times. Valo described the song as an &quot;apt intro for the record. Short, tight, and smacks you right in the face&quot;. &quot;Poison Girl&quot; was written about a specific girl in Valo&#x27;s life and about &quot;how you can destroy something so beautiful&quot;. &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; was the first single chosen from the album, and was written around the time of &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot;″s release. Valo continued to work on the song for approximately two years, and took influence from &#x27;80s music and the album &quot;Isola&quot; by Kent. Lyrically, the song was inspired by &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, as well as Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot;, and talks about &quot;how far are you willing to go for somebody you care for&quot;. According to Valo, &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; was also the first song to feature &quot;that corniness and tongue-in-cheek nature, that was missing from the first album&quot;. The UK division of BMG initially refused to release the album, as they felt that &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; was too much of a &quot;schlager&quot;, fearing it would ruin the rest of the album.

&quot;Right Here in My Arms&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; were written around the same time Valo was working on &quot;Join Me in Death&quot;, thus both retain the same &#x27;80s influence. Valo described &quot;Right Here in My Arms&quot; as a &quot;Billy Idol ripoff&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; as what &quot;Bon Jovi putting on goth masks&quot; would sound like. &quot;Gone with the Sin&quot; was singled out by Valo as one of his favorites from the album, calling it &quot;a simple love song, but where the cliches have been turned on their heads&quot;. Lyrically, the song was inspired by a relationship of Valo&#x27;s, in which &quot;both participants weren&#x27;t doing that well&quot;. Valo described &quot;Razorblade Kiss&quot; as HIM&#x27;s &quot;tribute to Kiss and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and &quot;Bury Me Deep Inside Your Heart&quot; as &quot;Depeche Mode meets Roxette&quot;. The bass line of &quot;Heaven Tonight&quot; makes use of a wah-wah pedal, which was operated by Valo, while Mige played the part. According to Valo, the &quot;heaven&quot; in the lyrics symbolizes &quot;something happy happening or some sort of fulfillment&quot;. &quot;Death Is in Love with Us&quot; was described by Valo as a &quot;goth anthem&quot; and was considered for the opening of the album. &quot;One Last Time&quot; was written with the idea of having a happier end to the record, and was described by Valo as the &quot;apology&quot; at the end of the &quot;romance&quot; that begins with &quot;I Love You (Prelude to Tragedy)&quot;, and serves as the final plea to &quot;try one last time&quot;. While recording vocals for the song, Valo was surrounded by the rest of the band (sans drummer Mika &quot;Gas Lipstick&quot; Karppinen) sitting naked in a lotus position. The band also forced keyboardist Juska Salminen to record the song naked, which took two hours of convincing. For the international editions of the album, HIM also re-recorded the tracks &quot;Your Sweet 666&quot; and &quot;Wicked Game&quot; from their debut album, as well as &quot;Stigmata Diaboli&quot; from the EP &quot;666 Ways to Love: Prologue&quot;, which was retitled &quot;Sigillum Diaboli&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

HIM initially wanted to release &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; in the fall of 1999 in Finland, in order to start a supporting tour, but BMG Germany refused, fearing the album would be bought there through importing. Thus it was decided that &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; would be released simultaneously in Finland and internationally. &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; was released as the first single from the album in November 1999, and charted in seven countries, reaching number one in Finland and Germany. &quot;Join Me in Death&quot; would eventually be certified platinum in Finland, and gold in Germany and Austria. BMG had been reluctant to release the song as a single, but eventually complied, after the song was chosen to appear on the soundtrack of the 1999 science fiction film &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;. The version included in the film and released as a single was an early mix, not included on the finished album. Two music videos were produced for the song; the first featured the single mix as well as scenes from &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;, while the second was shot in England and directed by Billy Yukich. HIM was later invited to perform on Germany&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; to promote the song. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; was released on 24 January 2000 and charted in six countries, peaking at number one in Finland, Germany and Austria. The album would eventually go double platinum in Finland, triple gold in Germany, and gold in Austria. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; also charted at number eight on the US Heatseekers Chart in January 2004, making it the band&#x27;s first album to chart in the United States.

After the album&#x27;s release, HIM began the supporting tour for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; with a seventeen date Finnish leg, which was entirely sold-out. This was followed by a European tour, which lasted nine months and 88 shows. In May 2000, HIM also embarked on their first tour of England, which lasted six dates, starting at The Garage in London. The intense touring cycle and promotional work exhausted the band, to the point where Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel, before being pulled back by friends, and Salminen ended up in the emergency room after a prank gone wrong. HIM nearly disbanded during this time, but things eventually settled down and the band continued touring. &quot;Right Here in My Arms&quot;, &quot;Gone with the Sin&quot; and &quot;Poison Girl&quot; were released as the follow-up singles from the album, with the former two peaking at number one in Finland, and the latter at number three. All three singles also made the German Singles Chart and received music videos. The re-recorded &quot;Your Sweet 666&quot; and &quot;Wicked Game&quot; were also released as singles in the UK, with the latter receiving a new music video.

HIM were awarded &quot;Band of the Year&quot;, and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; for &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, at the 2000 Emma Awards, as well as the &quot;Viewers&#x27; Choice Award&quot;, and &quot;Video of the Year&quot; for &quot;Join Me in Death&quot;, at the 2000 VIVA Comet Awards. &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; would also be awarded at the 2004 IFPI Platinum Europe Awards. In 2001, HIM were involved in a dispute over the rights to their name in the United States, as the moniker &quot;HIM&quot; was already owned by a drummer from a Chicago jazz fusion band of the same name. This meant that HIM were renamed HER in the US, and released &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; under that moniker. A settlement was eventually reached between the two parties, which allowed both to retain the name HIM.

==Reception==

&quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Borivoj Krgin of Blabbermouth.net gave the album ten out of ten, and called it &quot;yet another amazingly crafted album from Europe&#x27;s best-kept secret&quot;. He described the material as being the strongest he&#x27;d heard in years, singling out Valo&#x27;s songwriting ability to blend &quot;goth metal influences with mindlessly catchy pop melodies&quot; as a &quot;virtually unbeatable combination&quot;. Krgin also felt that the album&#x27;s appeal would extend to a &quot;much wider cross-section of the rock world&quot; than many of the band&#x27;s peers. Taavi Lindfors of Imperiumi.net called &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; one of the milestones of Finnish heavy music, and awarded it a nine-plus out of ten. He singled out the songwriting and Valo&#x27;s vocal delivery as particular highlights, and felt that nearly every song on the album had &quot;the potential to be a hit&quot;.

Holger Stratmann of &quot;Rock Hard&quot;, who rated the album nine out of ten, praised HIM&#x27;s ability to surpass their debut and their skill to write &quot;simple, compact earworms&quot;. Particular praise was also given to Valo&#x27;s vocals and Gas Lipstick&#x27;s drumming, which were echoed by Antti Mattila of &quot;Soundi&quot;, who awarded the album four stars out of five. Mattila compared the material as being lighter and more accessible than the band&#x27;s debut, and commended the album&#x27;s production, remarking: &quot;a sound this strong isn&#x27;t created out of nothing&quot;. &quot;Rumba&quot;″s Tero Valkonen gave &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; eight out of ten, praising both the performances of the band and Valo, but noted the production as &quot;playing it safe&quot;. Jarkko Jokelainen of &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; was generally positive in his review of &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot;, giving praise to Valo&#x27;s performance, but criticized some of the material backing him as sounding &quot;flat&quot;. Antti J. Ravelin of AllMusic was mixed in his review, calling the album &quot;over-produced&quot; and awarding it two-and-a-half stars out of five. He did still commend the material and stated that &quot;horrendous cliches in lyrics and playing don&#x27;t really matter, because HIM recycles them well&quot;. He concluded by stating: &quot;the songs as a whole are organized well, and it&#x27;s easy to listen the album the whole way through.&quot;

In 2017, Valo revisited &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; and called it the band&#x27;s &quot;success&quot;, stating: &quot;With this record we created a gilded cage for ourselves. Something wonderful, that you&#x27;re the captive of&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; later ranked &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; as HIM&#x27;s best record and described it as &quot;the definitive love metal album&quot;. &quot;KaaosZine&quot; felt similarly, ranking &quot;Razorblade Romance&quot; third in the band&#x27;s discography, describing it as an album &quot;full of vigorous pop songs, equipped catchy choruses&quot;.

In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

<doc id="964229" wikidata="Q1126500" url="?curid=964229" title="Protoplast">
<text>Protoplast (), is a biological term coined by Hanstein in 1880 to refer to the entire cell, excluding the cell wall. Protoplasts can be generated by stripping the cell wall from plant, bacterial, or fungal cells by mechanical, chemical or enzymatic means.

Protoplasts differ from spheroplasts in that their cell wall has been completely removed. Spheroplasts retain part of their cell wall. In the case of Gram-negative bacterial spheroplasts, for example, the peptidoglycan component of the cell wall has been removed but the outer membrane component has not.

==Enzymes for the preparation of protoplasts==
Cell walls are made of a variety of polysaccharides. Protoplasts can be made by degrading cell walls with a mixture of the appropriate polysaccharide-degrading enzymes:

During and subsequent to digestion of the cell wall, the protoplast becomes very sensitive to osmotic stress. This means cell wall digestion and protoplast storage must be done in an isotonic solution to prevent rupture of the plasma membrane.

==Uses for protoplasts==
Protoplasts can be used to study membrane biology, including the uptake of macromolecules and viruses . These are also used in somaclonal variation.

Protoplasts are widely used for DNA transformation (for making genetically modified organisms), since the cell wall would otherwise block the passage of DNA into the cell. In the case of plant cells, protoplasts may be regenerated into whole plants first by growing into a group of plant cells that develops into a callus and then by regeneration of shoots (caulogenesis) from the callus using plant tissue culture methods. Growth of protoplasts into callus and regeneration of shoots requires the proper balance of plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium that must be customized for each species of plant. Unlike protoplasts from vascular plants, protoplasts from mosses, such as &quot;Physcomitrella patens&quot;, do not need phytohormones for regeneration, nor do they form a callus during regeneration. Instead, they regenerate directly into the filamentous protonema, mimicking a germinating moss spore.

Protoplasts may also be used for plant breeding, using a technique called protoplast fusion. Protoplasts from different species are induced to fuse by using an electric field or a solution of polyethylene glycol. This technique may be used to generate somatic hybrids in tissue culture.

Additionally, protoplasts of plants expressing fluorescent proteins in certain cells may be used for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), where only cells fluorescing a selected wavelength are retained. Among other things, this technique is used to isolate specific cell types (e.g., guard cells from leaves, pericycle cells from roots) for further investigations, such as transcriptomics.

<doc id="964230" wikidata="Q16964253" url="?curid=964230" title="Populuxe">
<text>Populuxe was a consumer culture and aesthetic in the United States popular in the 1950s and 1960s. The term &quot;populuxe&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;popular&quot; and &quot;luxury&quot;.

== Description ==
The style evoked a sense of luxury with the design of consumer goods such as radios and clocks typically featuring pastel-colored plastic in curved and angular shapes and metalized plastic trim that simulated chrome. Structures commonly used pastels, geometric shapes, and surfaces of stucco, sheet metal, and often stainless steel.

Populuxe emerged after people began seeing semi-luxury commodities as luxury ware and mass consumer goods. It is also interpreted as a mass culture that desired luxury finishes on everyday material goods. It is said to be an offshoot of Fordism in the early 20th century and was also facilitated by the start of the emulative celebrity culture.

The work of various artists, designers, graphic designers, furniture designers, interior designers, and architects is associated with the populuxe movement. Populuxe is associated with consumerism and overlaps with mid-century modern architecture, Streamline Moderne, Googie architecture (Doo Wop architecture), and other futuristic and Space Age influenced design aesthetics that were futurist, technology-focused, and optimistic in nature.

<doc id="964233" wikidata="Q6716324" url="?curid=964233" title="MIT Sloan Management Review">
<text>&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; (&quot;MIT SMR&quot;) is a magazine and multiplatform publisher. It features research-based articles on strategic leadership, digital innovation, and sustainable business. It aims to give readers practical, of-the-moment guidance for leading in an ever-shifting world. &quot;MIT SMR&quot; publishes in print quarterly and online daily. It creates content across various media, including web, app, podcast, live and recorded video, and via distributors and libraries worldwide. 

&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; has published articles by Nancy Baym, Clayton Christensen, Thomas H. Davenport, Nancy Duarte, Amy Edmondson, Nicolai J. Foss, Vijay Govindarajan, Lynda Gratton, Gary Hamel, Linda Hill, Peter G. Klein, Mary Lacity, Benjamin Laker, Rita Gunther McGrath, Pamela Meyer, C.K. Prahalad, and Thomas J. Roulet.

==Background==
&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; was established as &quot;Industrial Management Review&quot; in 1959. In 1970, the magazine was renamed &quot;Sloan Management Review&quot;. In 2001, &quot;Sloan Management Review&quot; added MIT to its name, becoming &quot;MIT Sloan Management Review.&quot; &quot;MIT SMR&quot; is editorially independent from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MIT Sloan School of Management. 

==Editorial Mission==
&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; leads the discourse about advances in management practice among influential thought leaders in business and academia. It equips its readers with evidence-based insights and guidance to innovate, operate, lead, and create value in a world being transformed by technology and large-scale societal and environmental forces.

== The Future of Work ==
&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; hosts an annual virtual summit on the future of work. Each summit brings together experts from industry and academia to discuss a wide variety of workplace- and workforce-related topics, including talent management, workforce organization, and digital transformation. The goal of each summit is to provide leaders with an outlook on the year ahead and prepare them for the coming shifts to how, when, where, and why we work.

==Culture 500==
The Culture 500 ranks more than 500 of the largest corporations operating in the United States by how favorably employees rate their corporate culture. The initiative, which started as an MIT research project, is a collaboration between &quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot; and CultureX. It is the largest systematic study of corporate culture ever conducted. It analyzes 1.4 million Glassdoor employee reviews from more than 500 companies and uses natural language processing developed by CultureX to identify culturally significant terms at 90% or higher accuracy. The list measures nine cultural values: agility, collaboration, customer orientation, diversity, execution, innovation, integrity, performance, and respect. Starting in 2020, The Culture 500 began releasing Culture Champions, a list of corporations that surpass industry standards for the nine Culture 500 cultural values and meet other noteworthy criteria, such as ranking in the 30th percentile for overall culture and exhibiting high rates of diversity, integrity, and respect.

== Big Ideas ==
&quot;MIT Sloan Management Review&quot;’s Big Ideas initiatives explore key trends at the intersection of technology and management. The initiatives use a collaborative research model that engages &quot;MIT SMR&quot; editorial staff, academic guest editors, and thought leaders from consulting firms, foundations, and dedicated research groups. Research is conducted via global surveys of and in-depth interviews with front-line leaders, many of whom work at Fortune 500 companies. Big Ideas initiatives are multiplatform, with findings published as case studies, videos, articles, annual research reports, and interactive data visualizations.

<doc id="964234" wikidata="Q965897" url="?curid=964234" title="Confession of Faith (1689)">
<text>The Confession of Faith (1689), also known as the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, or the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith (to distinguish it from the 1644 London Baptist Confession of Faith), is a Particular Baptist confession of faith. It was written by English Baptists who subscribed to a Calvinistic soteriology as well as to a covenantal (yet non-Westminsterian) systematic theology. Because it was adopted by the Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches in the 18th century, it is also known as the Philadelphia Confession of Faith. The Philadelphia Confession, however, was a modification of the Second London Confession; it added an allowance for the singing of hymns, psalms, and spiritual songs in the Lord&#x27;s Supper and made optional the laying on of hands in baptism.

==History==
The Confession was first published in London in 1677 under the title &quot;A confession of Faith put forth by the Elders and Brethren of many Congregations of Christians, Baptized upon Profession of their Faith in London and the Country. With an Appendix concerning Baptism.&quot; It was a revision of the Savoy Declaration (1658) with modifications to reflect Baptist theology. &quot;Savoy&quot; is itself a revision of the Westminster Confession (1646) from presbyterian to congregational church polity. The Confession was published again, under the same title, in 1688 and 1689.

The Act of Toleration passed by the Parliament of England in 1689 enabled religious freedom and plurality to co-exist alongside the established churches in England and Scotland. In response to the Act, representatives from over 100 Particular Baptist churches gathered in London from 3–12 September of 1689 to discuss and endorse the 1677 document. Thus, despite the fact that the document was written in 1677, the official preface to the Confession has ensured that it would be known as the &quot;1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.&quot;

== Contents ==
The Confession consists of 32 chapters, as well as an introduction and a list of signatories.

# Of the Holy Scriptures

== Distinctives ==

* The law&#x27;s continued value for Christians - while Christ &quot;abrogated&quot; the Levitical &quot;ceremonial&quot; laws, the Confession cites Christ to have &quot;strengthened this obligation&quot; to obey the &quot;moral&quot; law expressed in the Ten Commandments, which &quot;for ever binds all.&quot;
* Forbids prayers for the dead, whether faithful or damned.
* Sabbatarianism - A weekly Sabbath day is prescribed and believed &quot;to be continued to the end of the world&quot; but a 7th year annual sabbath is ignored (cf. Lev. 25ff.)
* Marriage is a monogamous heterosexual ordinance.
* Intermarriage - Christians ought not intermarry with other religions, nor with any who believe &quot;damnable heresies,&quot; but are to marry &quot;in the Lord,&quot; and thereby not be &quot;unequally yoked.&quot;
* Two church offices - (1) elders (also called &quot;bishops&quot; or &quot;pastors&quot;) and (2) deacons.
* Eternal torment.
* An open view on the millennium. The Confession does not espouse a particular view on the millennium (cf. chapter 32).

==Influences==
Particular Baptists were quick to develop churches in colonial America, and in 1707 the Philadelphia Baptist Association was formed. This association formally adopted the 1689 Confession in 1742 after years of tacit endorsement by individual churches and congregational members. With the addition of two chapters (on the singing of psalms and the laying on of hands), it was retitled &quot;The Philadelphia Confession of Faith&quot;. Further Calvinistic Baptist church associations formed in the mid-late 18th century adopted the Confession as &quot;The Baptist Confession.&quot;

== Current usage ==
Baptist churches around the world continue to subscribe to the 1689 Baptist Confession as the fullest statement of their beliefs. Many 1689 churches are listed in directories like the Reformed Wiki, the Farese Church Directory and the 1689 Church Directory.

== Modernizations ==
Efforts have been made in recent years to modernize the language of the 1689 Baptist Confession to make it more accessible to contemporary readers. Some approaches are rather free, such as SM Houghton&#x27;s &quot;A Faith to Confess,&quot; while others, such as Jeremy Walker&#x27;s &quot;Rooted and Grounded,&quot; are more conservative&quot;.&quot; Still others, like Stan Reeve&#x27;s &quot;The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith In Modern English&quot; lie somewhere between. A comparison from the first paragraph demonstrates this:&quot;. . . which maketh the Holy Scriptures to be most necessary, those former ways of God&#x27;s revealing His will unto His people being now ceased.&quot; (Banner of Truth, 1689)

&quot;And as the manner in which God formerly revealed His will has long ceased, the Holy Scripture becomes absolutely essential to men.&quot; (A Faith to Confess, 1975)

&quot;This means that the Holy Scriptures are most necessary, because God’s former ways of revealing his will to his people have now ended.&quot; (Rooted and Grounded, 2021)

&quot;Therefore, the Holy Scriptures are absolutely necessary, because God&#x27;s former ways of revealing His will to His people have now ceased.&quot; (The 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith in Modern English, 2017) 

== Modern expositions ==
Several expositions of the 2LBCF have been published in recent years. 

&quot;A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession&quot;, by Samuel Waldron, first published in 1989, was one of the first influential expositions of the confession in recent years. It has remained an influential work ever since, going through several editions, revisions, and corrections. Since it was first published, reformed Baptist scholarship has matured in several respects, particularly regarding covenant theology. Nevertheless, it remains a respected source for understanding the theology of the 2LBCF. 

&quot;A New Exposition of the London Baptist Confession of Faith&quot;, edited by Rob Ventura, is a collection of essays written by various reformed Baptist pastors and scholars expounding upon the theology of the 2LBCF.

&quot;To the Judicious and Impartial Reader&quot;, by James Renihan is part of a multi-volume series covering 17th century reformed Baptist documents. Renihan&#x27;s work is much larger than that of Waldron or Ventura.

<text>[[Her Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ship|HMAS]] &quot;Sydney&quot; was a &quot;Chatham&quot;-class light cruiser of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Laid down in 1911 and launched in 1912, the cruiser was commissioned into the RAN in 1913.

During the early stages of World War I, &quot;Sydney&quot; was involved in supporting the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, and escorting the first ANZAC convoy. On 9 November 1914, she defeated the German cruiser at the Battle of Cocos. During 1915 and 1916, &quot;Sydney&quot; operated on the North America and West Indies Station, before joining the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at Greenock, Scotland in November 1916. On 4 May 1917, the cruiser was involved in an inconclusive action against the German zeppelin &quot;L43&quot;; neither was damaged. During late 1917, &quot;Sydney&quot; became the first Australian warship to launch an aircraft, and the first warship to do so from a rotatable platform.

After the war&#x27;s end, &quot;Sydney&quot; spent a year in reserve before being reactivated to serve as Flagship of the RAN. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1928 and broken up for scrap. Several sections of the ship, including her bow and foremast, have been preserved as monuments, and three of the ship&#x27;s main guns saw later use in shore fortifications.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Sydney&quot; was a light cruiser, of the &quot;Chatham&quot; subclass. She had a standard displacement of 5,400 tons. The cruiser was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a mean of , and a draught of . Coal- and oil-fuelled Yarrow boilers were connected to Parsons geared turbines, which provided shaft horsepower to the ship&#x27;s four propellers. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Sydney&quot; achieved a mean maximum of during trials. Her economical cruising speed was rated at in 1921, and in 1926. The standard ship&#x27;s company was 376 strong, but during wartime, this would increase to the maximum of 475; 31 officers and 454 sailors.
The cruiser&#x27;s main armament was made up of eight single BL 6-inch Mark XI guns. Secondary and anti-aircraft armament consisted of a single quick-firing high-angle anti-aircraft gun and ten 0.303-inch machine guns (eight Lewis guns and two Maxim guns). Two 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted, with a payload of seven torpedoes carried. Two hydraulic-release depth charge chutes were carried for anti-submarine warfare. A single 12-pounder 8-cwt field gun and four 3-pounder Hotchkiss saluting guns rounded out the armament. Armour plating consisted of side belts thick amidships, tapering to thick at the bow and stern, along with protective decking over the engineering and magazine spaces, and an armoured conning tower.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was laid down by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company at Glasgow, Scotland, on 11 February 1911. The ship was launched on 29 August 1912 by the wife of Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson. &quot;Sydney&quot; was completed on 26 June 1913, and commissioned into the RAN that day. The ship cost approximately 385,000 pounds to build.

==Operational history==
===Early career and initial war operations===

&quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Albany, Western Australia on 19 September 1913, after completing her maiden voyage. The cruiser operated off eastern Australia until March 1914, when she sailed to Singapore to meet the two new Australian submarines and . The three vessels reached Sydney in May, and the cruiser was reassigned to patrols along the eastern coast.

When World War I started, &quot;Sydney&quot; was north-bound to join Admiral George Patey and the battlecruiser . The ships were quickly assigned to protect the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, which was used to capture German colonial assets in the region; &quot;Sydney&quot; participated in operations against Rabaul and Anguar Island in September. In October, &quot;Sydney&quot; and sister ship left Patey&#x27;s squadron for Sydney, where they joined the escort of the first convoy delivering Australian and New Zealand soldiers to Egypt. The convoy sailed around the southern coast of Australia to Albany, then departed on 1 November for Colombo.

===Battle of Cocos===
On the morning of 9 November, the communications station at Direction Island, in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group, was captured by the German light cruiser . Before capture, the station was able to transmit an SOS, which was received by the troop convoy, and &quot;Sydney&quot; was ordered to investigate. &quot;Emden&quot;″s wireless operators had overheard the distress call and the orders to &quot;Sydney&quot;, and prepared to meet the Australian warship.

&quot;Sydney&quot;″s first indication of &quot;Emden&quot;″s location was when the German ship began to fire at a range of . The Australian warship was able to fire for effect after two salvos, destroying &quot;Emden&quot;″s three funnels, foremast, wireless and steering gear, and setting the engine room on fire. The German ship beached herself on North Keeling Island, and &quot;Sydney&quot; went after the supporting collier &quot;Buresk&quot;, but the ship had already commenced scuttling, and the Australian warship returned to &quot;Emden&quot;. The Germans were still flying their war ensign, but pulled it down after &quot;Sydney&quot; transmitted an instruction to surrender, then fired two salvos when no response was forthcoming.

In the course of the engagement, &quot;Sydney&quot; had fired some 670 rounds of ammunition, with around 100 hits claimed. She had meanwhile been hit sixteen times; three of her crew were killed and thirteen were wounded. 134 German personnel were killed, with the rest of the ship&#x27;s company were captured by &quot;Sydney&quot; (apart from a shore party, which commandeered the schooner &quot;Ayesha&quot; and escaped) and were delivered to British forces at Valletta, Malta. After leaving Malta, the Australian cruiser proceeded to join the North America and West Indies Station, arriving in Bermuda on 6 January 1915.

===Atlantic Ocean===
&quot;Sydney&quot; spent eighteen months uneventfully patrolling along the west coast of the Americas. On 9 September 1916, the cruiser sailed for the United Kingdom, and after a brief refit in Greenock, joined the 5th Battle Squadron at Scapa Flow. On 15 November, &quot;Sydney&quot; was reassigned to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at Greenock.
On 4 May 1917, while patrolling in the North Sea with the cruiser and the destroyers , , and , &quot;Sydney&quot; took part in a battle with Zeppelin &quot;L43&quot;. The airship dropped 10 to 12 bombs towards &quot;Sydney&quot; which failed to hit the ship (although the airship claimed to have hit one of the cruisers; the first air attack on an Australian warship. The Zeppelin was driven off by anti-aircraft fire.

In August 1917, &quot;Sydney&quot; docked at Chatham for a three-month refit. During this, was fitted with a new tripod mast and a revolving aircraft launch platform; the first fitted to any warship. On 8 December, after acquiring a Sopwith Pup aircraft from sister ship &quot;Dublin&quot;, &quot;Sydney&quot; became the first RAN vessel to launch an aircraft. On 17 December, the Pup was launched again, this time with the ramp rotated to face into the wind; the first launch of an aircraft from a ship-mounted rotating platform. The Pup was replaced by a Sopwith Camel in early 1918. On 1 June 1918, the aircraft was launched for its only combat sortie, after two German aircraft were spotted while &quot;Sydney&quot; and the rest of the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were heading to Heligoland Bight for a raid. The Camel chased the two aircraft for and shot down one, but was then forced to break off when one gun jammed and the other ran out of ammunition. Unable to locate &quot;Sydney&quot;, the pilot ditched near the destroyer .

The Australian cruiser was present at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet on 21 November 1918, and was assigned to escort another &quot;Emden&quot;, the named to honour &quot;Sydney&quot;″s opponent at the Battle of Cocos. &quot;Sydney&quot; left England for home in April 1919. Initially, the cruiser only received one battle honour, &quot;&quot;Emden&quot; 1914&quot;, for her wartime service; this was one of only three single-ship action honours awarded during the 20th century. Following an overhaul of the RAN honours system in 2010, &quot;Sydney&quot; was retroactively awarded two more battle honours: &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot; and &quot;North Sea 1917–18&quot;.

===Post-war===
&quot;Sydney&quot; was paid off into reserve on 13 April 1923. Following a refit, she was recommissioned on 29 September 1924 to serve as Flagship of the RAN.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Sydney&quot; paid off at Sydney on 8 May 1928 and arrived at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in 1929, where she was broken up. The ship&#x27;s foremast was retained, and in 1934, it was erected at Bradleys Head by the &quot;Titan&quot;. This initially served as a monument to the engagement against &quot;Emden&quot;, but was rededicated in 1964 as a monument for all Australian ships lost and all sailors killed in the line of duty. Part of the bow, including the stem head, jackstaff, and fairleads, was set into the seawall at Milsons Point, under the Sydney Harbour Bridge. One of the cruiser&#x27;s derricks is on display in the Victory Memorial Gardens in Wagga Wagga, and a compass stand is located at Port Macquarie. The main top-mast was erected at Environa, but rotted at the base and collapsed. It was later moved to Jervis Bay.

The wheel from HMAS Sydney is on display in the upstairs foyer at Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron in St Kilda, Melbourne.

During the 1930s, two of the 6-inch guns were transported to Western Australia, and in 1938 were installed at Buckley Point on Rottnest Island. These were withdrawn from service and placed in storage in 1944, then were sold to a scrap merchant in 1963. However, the dealer never collected them, and the guns remained on site until 1980, when army reservists retrieved and refurbished them, with one on display outside the Army Museum of Western Australia. Another of the ship&#x27;s guns was used on Thursday Island from 1940 to 1987.

In 2014 a shield removed from during a refit in 1943 and dumped on a tip on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, was transported to Perth for refurbishment. A member of the Royal Australian Artillery Historical Society of Western Australia, which had been searching for such a shield for 20 years as a match for a 6-inch Mk XI naval gun it held from HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; had spotted the shield at location. The naval gun and shield were installed at the Leighton Battery in September 2015 to replicate the original 6-inch guns at site.

<text>HMAS &quot;Sydney, named for the Australian city of [[Sydney]], was one of three modified [[Leander-class cruiser (1931)|&quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruisers]] operated by the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). Ordered for the [[Royal Navy]] asHMS &quot;Phaeton, the cruiser was purchased by the Australian government and renamed prior to her 1934 launch.

During the early part of her operational history, &quot;Sydney&quot; helped enforce sanctions during the Abyssinian Crisis, and at the start of World War II was assigned to convoy escort and patrol duties in Australian waters. In May 1940, &quot;Sydney&quot; joined the British Mediterranean Fleet for an eight-month deployment, during which she sank two Italian warships, participated in multiple shore bombardments, and provided support to the Malta Convoys, while receiving minimal damage and no casualties. On her return to Australia in February 1941, &quot;Sydney&quot; resumed convoy escort and patrol duties in home waters.

On 19 November 1941, &quot;Sydney&quot; was involved in a mutually destructive engagement with the , and was lost with all hands (645 aboard). The wrecks of both ships were lost until 2008; &quot;Sydney&quot; was found on 17 March, four days after her adversary. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s defeat is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. However, the cruiser&#x27;s loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the Germans has resulted in conspiracy theories alleging that the German commander used illegal ruses to lure &quot;Sydney&quot; into range, that a Japanese submarine was involved, and that the true events of the battle are concealed behind a wide-ranging cover-up, despite the lack of evidence for these allegations.

==Construction and acquisition==
The ship was laid down by Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne, England, on 8 July 1933 for the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Phaeton&quot;, named after the Greek mythological figure. However, in 1934, the Australian government was seeking a replacement for the light cruiser , and negotiated to purchase &quot;Phaeton&quot; while she was still under construction.

The cruiser was renamed after the capital city of New South Wales, and was launched on 22 September 1934 by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, former prime minister of Australia and the serving Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. &quot;Sydney&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 24 September 1935, drawing her ship&#x27;s company from &quot;Brisbane&quot;, which had been decommissioned earlier that day.

Following the announcement that Australia was purchasing a British-built cruiser, there was criticism, primarily from the Opposition of the day, stating that such a warship should be built using Australian resources and labour. Several reasons were given in reply for acquiring British-built cruisers instead of Australian-made: the ship was already close to completion, the pending threat of war meant that there was not enough time to train Australians in the necessary shipbuilding skills, and that of the two cruisers built in Australian shipyards, one () had taken seven years to complete.

==Design==

&quot;Sydney&quot; was one of three Modified &quot;Leander&quot;-class light cruisers acquired by the RAN during the late 1930s. Although the first ship of the class to join the RAN, &quot;Sydney&quot; was the second ship to be laid down, although the first to be completed, in what was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Perth&quot; class: and operated with the Royal Navy for a short period before they were purchased by Australia in 1938. Like most British cruisers, the &quot;Leander&quot;s were designed for long-range patrols, scouting, and trade protection duties.

&quot;Sydney&quot;″s displacement ranged between 6,701 tons (light) and 8,940 tons (full load), with a standard displacement of 7,198 tons: improved fabrication and welding techniques made her 52 tons lighter than her sister ships. She had a length of between perpendiculars and overall, a beam of , and a draught at standard displacement between forward and aft.

The ship was propelled by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, feeding Parsons single-reduction geared turbines, which supplied to the four propeller shafts. Unlike the first five &quot;Leander&quot;s, which had their machinery arranged on the &quot;in-line&quot; principle (consisting of six boilers in three compartments forward, and four turbines in two further compartments aft), &quot;Sydney&quot; was designed with two redundant machinery groups, a design practice adopted from the United States Navy. The cruiser had two boilers and the turbines for the outer shafts forward, and two boilers and the turbines for the inner shafts aft; as steam from any boiler could be routed to any turbine, the ship could continue operating if one space was damaged.

Each space had its own uptake, giving the modified ships a different profile to the single-funnelled early &quot;Leander&quot;s; an arrangement which contributed to naval historian Henry Lenton&#x27;s description of the Modified &quot;Leander&quot;s as &quot;the most handsome cruisers ever built by the Royal Navy, with a symmetry that was as attractive as it was functional.&quot;

&quot;Sydney&quot; and her sister ships were constructed from hull plating, with a armour belt over the machinery spaces (the lengthening of this belt from to adequately cover both spaces negated the weight reduction from their reorganisation), and plates over the shell rooms and magazines. &quot;Sydney&quot; was the first Australian warship fitted with asdic; a Type 125 unit in a retractable pattern 3069 dome. The retractable sonar dome, located near the bow, was a weak point in the hull.

One of the cruiser&#x27;s early commanding officers, Royal Navy Captain J.W.A. Waller, believed that the ship&#x27;s single director control tower was a weak point in the design. The director control tower was the highest compartment on the ship, from where personnel would determine the range and optimum firing angle for a gun salvo, then transmit this information to the gun turrets: the actual firing could be controlled from the tower or the turret. Waller believed that the centralised system could be destroyed with a single hit, or the wiring linking the compartment to the turrets could be severed, forcing the four turrets to rely on independent control. Although Waller suggested that a second tower be installed aft to provide redundancy, it was deferred indefinitely as subsequent commanding officers did not share his concerns, and combat experiences of other &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruisers showed that the system was more robust than expected.

===Armament===
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s main armament consisted of eight 6-inch (152 mm) breech-loading Mk XXIII guns mounted in four Mk XXI twin turrets: &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; forward, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; aft. All eight guns could be fired in salvo, elevated to an angle of 60° and depressed to −5°, and fire eight rounds a minute at targets up to away.
Four 4-inch (100 mm) quick-firing Mk V guns, mounted on single, high-angle, Mk IV mountings, were fitted to a platform around the aft funnel. These were primarily used to target aircraft at heights up to , but could also be used against surface targets, with a maximum range of . Their replacement with eight Mk XIX high-angle/low-angle guns in four twin mounts, which was to occur in the late 1930s, was prevented by the outbreak of World War II. The guns could have been swapped out during a maintenance docking, but the demand for cruisers and &quot;Sydney&quot;″s fortune in never sustaining major damage meant that the additional time in dock could not be justified. For close-range anti-aircraft defence, the 4-inch guns were supplemented by twelve Vickers Mk III machine guns, which were arranged in three Mk II quadruple mountings, one on each side of the forward superstructure, and the third on top of the aft superstructure.

A mixture of 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns were used for close defence work, and could be fitted to pedestals at various points on the ship, primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one either side of the forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, &quot;Sydney&quot; carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns had been reduced to nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely.

Eight 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted in two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts to the deck below the platform for the 4-inch guns. Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. &quot;Sydney&quot; was fitted with a single depth charge rail at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns. These were removed during the August 1940 refit.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was fitted with a , cordite-powered revolving catapult between the two funnels, which was used to launch a Supermarine Walrus (sometimes described as a Seagull V) amphibious aircraft. The Walrus was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF (which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939). The 7-ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship&#x27;s boats.

==Operational history==

===Early history===
&quot;Sydney&quot; completed working up trials before sailing from Portsmouth on 29 October 1935, Captain J.U.P. Fitzgerald RN in command. Almost immediately after departing, &quot;Sydney&quot; was instructed to join the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean Fleet at Gibraltar and assist the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in enforcing economic sanctions against Italy in response to the Abyssinian crisis. During January 1936, the cruiser underwent maintenance in Alexandria and visited medical facilities in Cyprus: cases of rubella and mumps had been circulating through the ship&#x27;s company since late 1935. In March, &quot;Sydney&quot; was reassigned the 1st Cruiser Squadron, where she and the heavy cruiser continued to enforce sanctions and participate in fleet exercises with Royal Navy units. Following the resolution of the Abyssinian crisis, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed for Australia on 14 July; reaching Fremantle in late July before visiting Melbourne on 8 August and arriving in her namesake city three days later.
After reaching Australian waters, &quot;Sydney&quot; spent most of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises. In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, &quot;Sydney&quot; was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, &quot;Sydney&quot; was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, &quot;Sydney&quot; was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war footing, where she arrived on 22 August.

===Start of World War II===
Following the declaration of war, &quot;Sydney&quot; was instructed to carry out patrol and escort duties in Australian waters. Captain John Collins took over command of &quot;Sydney&quot; on 16 November. On 28 November, &quot;Sydney&quot; joined the Australian heavy cruisers and in an unsuccessful four-day search for the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, which was known to be operating in the Indian Ocean. &quot;Sydney&quot; was relieved by on 13 December, and sailed to Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney for a maintenance docking. The work was completed in late January 1940, and as a shakedown cruise &quot;Sydney&quot; joined &quot;Canberra&quot; and the British ships &quot;Leander&quot; and in escorting the Suez-bound Anzac convoy US 1; &quot;Sydney&quot; broke off after the convoy left the east coast of Australia and returned to Sydney. Returning to Fremantle on 6 February, &quot;Sydney&quot; relieved &quot;Australia&quot; as the cruiser responsible for patrol and escort duties on the west coast.

On 19 April, &quot;Sydney&quot; joined the escort of Anzac convoy US 2 off Albany, and remained with the convoy until it reached the Cocos Islands on 28 April and was replaced by . The Australian cruiser set course for Fremantle, but on 1 May was assigned to the East Indies Station and rerouted to Colombo, where she arrived on 8 May. Arriving in Colombo on 8 May, &quot;Sydney&quot; was immediately tasked with meeting Anzac convoy US 3 off the Cocos Islands and escorting it across the Indian Ocean. The cruiser departed on 12 May, but while en route, she was instructed to make for the Mediterranean.

Arriving back in Colombo on 18 May, &quot;Sydney&quot; replenished before sailing at high speed to Aden, where she arrived four days later. The Australian cruiser, accompanied by HM Ships and , departed the next day, with the ships crossing the Suez Canal during the night of 25–26 May, and arriving in Alexandria that afternoon at 15:30. &quot;Sydney&quot; was originally marked for operations in the Red Sea, but after observing the performance of an Australian five-destroyer flotilla assigned to the British Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Andrew Cunningham decided to &quot;keep the Australian cruiser for himself&quot; and attached &quot;Sydney&quot; to the Royal Navy&#x27;s 7th Cruiser Squadron.

===Mediterranean operations===
&quot;Sydney&quot; was in Alexandria harbour on 10 June 1940, and that evening learned of Italy&#x27;s intention to declare war at midnight. By 01:00 on 11 June, all ships in harbour had departed to search for Italian warships in position to attack Alexandria, and secure the sea lines of communication in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean. The Australian cruiser was involved in the westbound sweep, and sailed as far as the Gulf of Taranto during the four-day operation. Apart from an unsuccessful depth charge attack on a suspected submarine during the afternoon of 13 June, &quot;Sydney&quot; did not encounter any enemy vessels.
On 21 June, &quot;Sydney&quot; for the first time, joining the British cruisers and , the French battleship &quot;Lorraine&quot;, and a force of destroyers in shelling the Italian-controlled Libyan port of Bardia. &quot;Sydney&quot; focused her fire on a military camp throughout the twenty-two-minute bombardment. During this operation, the Australian ship&#x27;s Walrus amphibian performed bombardment spotting for the squadron, but was fired on by three biplanes: although reported at the time as Italian Fiat CR.42 Falcos, the attackers were later determined to be British Gloster Gladiators. The pilot flew the damaged aircraft to Mersa Matruh, and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his skill in doing so, but the unrepairable Walrus was the only casualty of the operation. The next day, a retaliatory airstrike against the ships, by then having returned to Alexandria, failed to do damage.

That same day, Germany and Vichy France signed the Second Armistice at Compiègne: although French warships (which had until that point operated with the Allies) were ordered to return to France and disarm, the British government was unwilling to allow them to fall into Axis hands. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the British warships in Alexandria turned their guns on the French, but unlike the situation in Mers-el-Kébir, which deteriorated into a naval battle, British Admiral Cunningham and French Admiral René-Emile Godfroy peacefully negotiated to disarm the ships at Alexandria.

&quot;Sydney&quot; and other elements of the 7th Squadron sailed from Alexandria on 27 June, escorting a Malta convoy. Late on 28 June, the ships engaged a force of three Italian destroyers carrying out a ressuply mission to Tobruk. Although two Italian vessels were able to continue their way, the third, &quot;Espero&quot; was disabled. At 20:00, &quot;Sydney&quot; (which had little opportunity to fire during the engagement) was detailed to recover any survivors and sink the destroyer while the rest of the force continued on to Malta. However, while from &quot;Espero&quot;, the Italian ship fired two shells, both of which fell in line with but short of the cruiser. &quot;Sydney&quot; opened fire, and after four salvos struck the destroyer with no shots fired in return, resumed the approach. &quot;Espero&quot; sank at 20:35, and &quot;Sydney&quot; remained in the area for almost two hours to collect survivors despite the risk of submarine attack, before she was ordered to withdraw to Alexandria. The cruiser rescued 47 Italians (three of whom died from wounds during the return voyage), and left a fully provisioned cutter in the water to be used by other Italian survivors after &quot;Sydney&quot; had departed.

On the evening of 7 July, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed from Alexandria as part of a fleet including four other light cruisers, three battleships, an aircraft carrier, and sixteen destroyers, divided into three groups. The three groups were to rendezvous on 9 July at a point east of Cape Passero and from Malta, at which point the destroyers would escort two convoys outbound from Malta, while the other vessels would attack targets of opportunity around Sicily. However, early on 8 June, the British submarine reported that she had unsuccessfully attacked an Italian fleet including two battleships. Throughout the day, the fleet had to defend itself from multiple Italian air raids: at one point &quot;Sydney&quot; and the other cruisers of the 7th Squadron attacked what they thought was a high-flying bomber, but was later determined to be the planet Venus. Aerial reconnaissance located the Italian force during the afternoon, which was made up of at least two battleships, accompanied by multiple cruisers and destroyers. The sightings of such a large force of warships, combined with the heavy air attack, led Admiral Andrew Cunningham to conclude that the Italians were also covering a major convoy, and decide to reposition his fleet between the Italians and Taranto, the projected destination.

Contact with the Italian fleet was lost during the night, but regained in the morning of 9 July. By 14:00, the Allied fleet had positioned itself in the Italians&#x27; path, and Cunningham ordered them west, to close on the projected position of the enemy and engage. &quot;Sydney&quot; spotted smoke at 14:45, and made visual contact with a force of five cruisers just after 15:00. The Allied cruiser squadron, supported by the battleship altered their course northward, and at 15:20, &quot;Sydney&quot; opened fire on an Italian &quot;Zara&quot;-class cruiser, distant, but both the Allied and Italian cruiser forces were unable to successfully hit their opposing numbers. &quot;Sydney&quot; remained unsuccessful until the late part of the engagement, when she successfully shelled a smokescreen-laying destroyer. The naval component of what came to be known as the Battle of Calabria concluded around 17:00, with Cunningham unwilling to pursue the Italian fleet through the smokescreen they had created. The Allied ships instead broke off for Malta, while enduring several heavy but ineffective air attacks; during the safe delivery of Malta Convoy MA 5 and the return to Alexandria on 13 July, &quot;Sydney&quot; sustained no damage, but expended all her anti-aircraft ammunition. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s participation in the battle earned the ship a battle honour: &quot;Calabria 1940&quot;.
The Australian cruiser spent five days in Alexandria for resupply and maintenance, before departing for Crete with the British destroyer . They arrived at sunset on 18 July, and the next morning, the two ships were ordered to patrol the Gulf of Athens for Axis warships and shipping, while providing support for a four-ship destroyer force (HM Ships , , , and ) conducting an anti-submarine sweep north of Crete. Believing that these two tasks were incompatible, and that protecting the destroyers was the more important, &quot;Sydney&quot;″s commander, Captain John Collins, ordered the two ships to move south of their patrol area while maintaining radio silence. At 07:20 on 19 July, the destroyer force spotted and was spotted by a pair of Italian light cruisers; &quot;Giovanni dalle Bande Nere&quot; and &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot;, which opened fire seven minutes later. The British destroyers turned to a north-east heading and set off at , broadcasting news of the attack to the silent &quot;Sydney&quot; while closing the gap between the two forces. Using the wireless signals to track the four destroyers, &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Havock&quot; made to intercept the destroyers and their cruiser pursuit, and was able to close at least half an hour earlier than if they had followed their original instructions: when &quot;Sydney&quot; opened fire on &quot;Bande Nere&quot; at 08:29, both sides were surprised by the appearance of the cruiser. Within minutes, &quot;Sydney&quot; had successfully damaged &quot;Bande Nere&quot;, and when the Italians withdrew to the south, the six Allied ships pursued. At 08:48, with &quot;Bande Nere&quot; hiding behind a smoke screen, &quot;Sydney&quot; shifted her fire to &quot;Bartolomeo Colleoni&quot;, which was disabled by 09:33. Collins ordered the destroyers to torpedo the ship and rescue survivors: &quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Ilex&quot;, and &quot;Havock&quot; did so, while &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Hasty&quot; supported &quot;Sydney&quot; in continuing pursuit of &quot;Bande Nere&quot;. At 10:37, the chase ended, as the faster Italian cruiser had outrun the Allies, visibility was reduced by smoke and haze, and ammunition aboard the pursuing ships was low: &quot;Sydney&quot; had ten shells left for her forward turrets. The six ships returned to Alexandria around 11:00 on 20 July after fending off several air attacks (one of which damaged &quot;Havock&quot;), and were met by cheering from all ships in the harbour.

The only damage to &quot;Sydney&quot; during what came to be known as the Battle of Cape Spada was caused by a shell at 09:21, which knocked a hole in the forward funnel, and wounded a sailor through splinter damage. For his actions, Collins was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath, while other officers and sailors from &quot;Sydney&quot; received two Distinguished Service Orders, two Distinguished Service Crosses, five Distinguished Service Medals, and twelve Mentions in Despatches between them. &quot;Sydney&quot; herself was awarded the battle honour &quot;Spada 1940&quot;.

After refuelling and rearming, &quot;Sydney&quot; and departed Alexandria on 27 July to join the covering force for a southbound convoy from the Aegean. The ships were attacked five times that afternoon by aircraft, but &quot;Sydney&quot; escaped with only minor damage and shrapnel wounds. The two cruisers broke away from the convoy the next day to locate and sink the Greek tanker &quot;Ermioni&quot;, which was supplying the Italian-held Dodecanese Islands. The two cruisers located &quot;Ermioni&quot; just before dusk: &quot;Sydney&quot; provided anti-submarine protection while the tanker&#x27;s crew were convinced to transfer to the British warships, after which &quot;Ermioni&quot; was shelled by &quot;Neptune&quot;. The two ships returned to Alexandria on 30 July, and &quot;Sydney&quot; departed the same day in company with for a three-day patrol.
Back in Alexandria, &quot;Sydney&quot; underwent a refit, during which a high, thick wall of armour plating was constructed around the 4-inch gun platform, while the ship&#x27;s company repainted the ship from standard grey to a naval camouflage pattern. The refit was completed by 12 August, when &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Neptune&quot;, and five destroyers set off to interdict Axis shipping along the north African coast and the Aegean Sea. The operation was cancelled after no ships were located during the first two days, and &quot;Sydney&quot; was tasked with assisting a destroyer squadron during shore bombardments at Bomba and Bardia. At the end of the month, the cruiser joined the escort of Malta convoy MB 5.

On the return voyage, &quot;Sydney&quot; and several other vessels were tasked with attacking Italian facilities. Canvas and timber were used to alter the cruiser&#x27;s profile to resemble an Italian &quot;Condottieri&quot;-class cruiser, allowing her to manoeuvre close to Scarpanto during the night of 3–4 September. At dawn, &quot;Sydney&quot; and the British destroyer &quot;Ilex&quot; attacked the Italian Makri Yalo Airbase at Scarpanto; the cruiser fired 135 shells in 25 minutes, while the destroyer fended off five E-boats, sinking two. On completion, the two ships rejoined the fleet, but were again mistaken for Italian warships and nearly fired on before &quot;Sydney&quot; raised the White Ensign and cut down her disguise. Admiral Cunningham congratulated &quot;Sydney&quot; with the message &quot;Well Done. You are a stormy petrel.&quot;, which was adopted as a nickname for the cruiser. On her return to Alexandria, the Australian cruiser underwent another short refit, which was completed late in the month: on 24 September &quot;Sydney&quot; supported during the interception of a French merchant ship, then completed a two-day patrol west of Cyprus. Late on 28 September, &quot;Sydney&quot; joined the heavy escort of a Malta-bound troop convoy. During the return voyage, &quot;Sydney&quot; and left the fleet on 1 October for a sweep of the Aegean Sea, which was concluded with a brief bombardment of Maltezana before returning to Alexandria two days later.
The entire Mediterranean fleet sailed from Alexandria on 8 October to provide cover for several Malta Convoys, and attempt to draw the Italian fleet into battle. The convoys reached their destination safely, and the operation was uneventful for &quot;Sydney&quot;; the only contact with Italian forces was an engagement during the early morning of 12 October between the British cruiser and seven Italian torpedo boats and destroyers, of which &quot;Ajax&quot; sank three and damaged a fourth. From 25 October, &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, and the destroyers and were engaged in a sweep of the Aegean for Axis vessels, reaching as far north as the Dardanelles. No major incidents occurred until 28 October, when the Italians invaded Greece: the four ships were recalled to Alexandria, where they arrived that evening. Shortly after, the two cruisers were joined by HM Ships and and met the main force of the Mediterranean fleet west of Crete on 30 October. Over the next few days, the warships patrolled around Crete and along the Greek mainland, and provided cover for the first supply convoy to Crete.

On 5 November, &quot;Sydney&quot; and departed from Port Said with military equipment to be used to establish an Allied advanced base at Souda Bay, Crete. After delivering the equipment, which included almost 1,000 soldiers, the equipment for a Bofors battery, cases of food, and several trucks, the cruisers rejoined the main fleet. The Mediterranean Fleet remained on patrol for several days, and during the night of 11–12 November, while the bulk of the fleet supported the world&#x27;s first all-naval-aircraft attack on the Italian fleet anchored in Taranto, &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and the destroyers and attempted to transit the Strait of Otranto as a diversion. Despite the mission of &quot;looking for trouble&quot;, the northbound passage through the strait passed without incident. The return was not so uneventful: at 01:20, a convoy of four merchantmen with two escorting destroyers was spotted by &quot;Sydney&quot;″s lookouts. The Allied warships manoeuvred in close, and opened fire at 01:27: &quot;Sydney&quot; directing her fire onto a freighter away. During the 23-minute engagement, the cruiser successfully contributed to the destruction of three merchant ships and damaged a destroyer, avoided a torpedo, and unsuccessfully fired two in return. At 01:57, the undamaged Allied force departed the strait, and met the main fleet before midday.

From 15 to 20 November, &quot;Sydney&quot; and three other cruisers transported 4,000 Allied soldiers and their equipment from Alexandria to the Piraeus as reinforcements for the Greek military. On returning to Alexandria, &quot;Sydney&quot; deployed with the majority of the Mediterranean fleet to cover multiple convoys across the sea: the Australian cruiser spent the remainder of the month operating throughout the eastern and central Mediterranean, and was bombed by Italian aircraft on 24 November at Souda Bay, but escaped damage. &quot;Sydney&quot; started December in the Aegean, where she escorted convoys and shelled the port of Valona, then proceeded to Malta for a refit and repairs to her rudder, which lasted until the end of the year. During this refit, the cruiser was fitted with degaussing equipment. The ship rejoined the fleet on 8 January 1941, when she was instructed to head home after proceeding along the north coast of Africa and linking up with any Australia-bound merchant ships she encountered. The recall was attributed to the need to bring &quot;Sydney&quot; in for a major refit and give her personnel leave, a plan to spread combat experience throughout the RAN by trading the cruiser with her sister ship, , and a need to protect Australia against the German merchant raiders operating in the area, particularly following the attacks on Nauru.
Before leaving, 100 of the ship&#x27;s company were removed on 11 January, so they could be sent to England to help man the new N-class destroyers. The next day, the ship sailed for Aden via the Suez Canal. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the troopship left Aden on 16 January to join Convoy SW 4B, which &quot;Sydney&quot; escorted until relieved by four days later. The Australian cruiser was instructed to attack any Italian ships at Mogadiscio, but as there were no large merchant ships in port and &quot;Sydney&quot; was forbidden to attack the harbour itself, she then proceeded to the Seychelles to refuel. On 24 January, &quot;Sydney&quot; was one of several warships which responded to an attack on the merchantman &quot;Mandasor&quot; by the German merchant raider &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Despite a three-day search, &quot;Sydney&quot; did not come into contact with &quot;Atlantis&quot;. &quot;Sydney&quot; resumed her voyage home, and arrived in her namesake city after sunset on 9 February. The cruiser anchored in Watsons Bay for the night, then sailed into the inner harbour the next morning and tied up alongside at Sydney Cove to a heroes&#x27; welcome. On 11 February, a holiday was declared for school students in Sydney, so they could join the thousands of people who witnessed the ship&#x27;s company perform a freedom of entry march.

As well as the battle honours for the battles at Calabria and Cape Spada, &quot;Sydney&quot; was granted the &quot;Mediterranean 1940&quot; battle honour for her various actions during the Mediterranean naval campaign. During the eight-month deployment, the only fatality in the ship&#x27;s company was a death due to illness.

===Australian waters===
Following a short refit, &quot;Sydney&quot; sailed for Fremantle on 27 February, where she was assigned to escort and patrol tasks in the Indian Ocean. This primarily involved meeting convoys off the southern Australian coast and escorting them on the next leg of their journey, either westbound to the Middle East and Europe, or northwards to the Dutch East Indies.

In April, &quot;Sydney&quot; escorted the troopship &quot;Queen Mary&quot; from Fremantle to Jervis Bay, before embarking Admiral Ragnar Colvin and a party of advisors from all three branches of the Australian military and transporting them to Singapore by 19 April for a secret conference between the British Commonwealth, the Netherlands East Indies, and the United States of America. The cruiser returned to Fremantle before month&#x27;s end, after which Collins handed command over to Captain Joseph Burnett on 15 May. Shortly after, the cruiser escorted the transport SS &quot;Zealandia&quot; during a troop transport run to Singapore. &quot;Sydney&quot; escorted the troopship to Sunda Strait, where responsibility was handed over to the British light cruiser .

In early June, &quot;Sydney&quot; met &quot;Zealandia&quot; and &quot;Danae&quot; on the troopship&#x27;s return voyage, and took over escort duties from Sunda Strait back to Fremantle. After replenishing in Fremantle, &quot;Zealandia&quot; joined a multiple ship convoy to the east coast of Australia, which was also escorted by &quot;Sydney&quot;. The convoy departed on 24 June and made for Sydney, after which the cruiser joined the escort of a Pacific convoy before returning for maintenance. This concluded on 8 August, when &quot;Sydney&quot; escorted the troopship &quot;Awatea&quot; to New Zealand, then Fiji.
On her return to Sydney at the end of August, the cruiser joined the troopships &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; during the first leg of their voyage (Anzac convoy US 12A), escorting them until rendezvousing with &quot;Canberra&quot; in the Great Australian Bight. &quot;Sydney&quot; then sailed to Melbourne, and remained until 19 September, during which her camouflage was repainted in a new pattern. The cruiser then escorted the four-ship Anzac convoy US 12B to Fremantle: heavy seas while crossing the Great Australian Bight caused &quot;A&quot; turret to become jammed on a port facing. This was repaired in Fremantle, and the convoy proceeded to Sunda Strait, where &quot;Sydney&quot; handed the merchant ships over to the British cruisers and &quot;Danae&quot; on 3 October and set course for Fremantle. On the night of 5–6 October, a mysterious ship that responded to challenge signals near Rottnest Island then disappeared led the Naval Officer in Charge Fremantle to believe that the approaches to the harbour had been mined. &quot;Sydney&quot; was diverted to intercept &quot;Queen Mary&quot; before the troopship reached Fremantle, and ordered to remain with her until a channel was swept and found free of mines. After reaching port on 7 October, &quot;Sydney&quot; officially assumed patrol and escort duties in Western Australian waters.

The next few weeks were uneventful for &quot;Sydney&quot;, and between 18 and 29 October, the cruiser visited Geraldton and Bunbury. On 2 November, the Australian cruiser sailed to meet &quot;Zealandia&quot; off Albany. The troopship was on a second troop transport run to Singapore; delivering the 8th Division. The two ships returned to Fremantle, and on 11 November, they departed for Sunda Strait. &quot;Zealandia&quot; was handed over on 17 November to for the next leg, and the Australian cruiser turned for home: she was scheduled to arrive in Fremantle late on 20 November.

==Final battle and loss==

:&quot;Note: all times in this section are UTC+7&quot;
On the afternoon of 19 November 1941, &quot;Sydney&quot; was off the coast of Western Australia, near Carnarvon, and heading south towards Fremantle. Around 15:55, the cruiser spotted a merchant ship on a northbound course, which quickly turned away from the coast at . &quot;Sydney&quot; increased speed to and made to intercept. As she closed the gap, &quot;Sydney&quot; began to signal the unidentified merchantman, first by signal light, then after no reply was forthcoming and the distance between the two ships had decreased, by a combination of light and signal flag.

The merchant ship hoisted her callsign, but as she was ahead and just port of &quot;Sydney&quot;, the flags were obscured by the funnel. The cruiser sent a request that the merchant ship make her signal letters clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the halyard and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship &quot;Straat Malakka&quot;, but she was not on &quot;Sydney&quot;″s list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with &quot;Sydney&quot; asking the Dutch ship&#x27;s destination and cargo.

At 17:00, a distress signal was transmitted by &quot;Straat Malakka&quot;, indicating that she was being pursued by a merchant raider. Following this, &quot;Sydney&quot; pulled alongside the merchant ship from astern; pacing the merchantman on a parallel course, approximately away. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s main guns and port torpedo launcher were trained on the ship, while she sent the interior portion of &quot;Straat Malakka&quot;″s secret callsign. Fifteen minutes later, at around 17:30, the merchantman had not replied, and &quot;Sydney&quot; sent a signal ordering her to show the secret callsign.
&quot;Straat Malakka&quot; had not replied because she was the German auxiliary cruiser in disguise, and when asked to reveal a callsign the Germans did not know, &quot;Kormoran&quot; responded by decamouflaging and opening fire. Prompted by the raider&#x27;s unveiling, &quot;Sydney&quot; also fired (accounts are divided as to which ship fired first), but while her first salvo either missed or passed through &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s upper superstructure with minimal damage, four of the raider&#x27;s six guns (the other two guns were on the port side and could not fire to starboard) were able to destroy the cruiser&#x27;s bridge and gun director tower, damage the forward turrets, and set the aircraft on fire.

&quot;Sydney&quot; did not fire again until after the raider&#x27;s sixth salvo: &quot;Y&quot; turret fired without effect, but &quot;X&quot; turret was able to put multiple shells into &quot;Kormoran&quot;, damaging machinery spaces and one of the raider&#x27;s guns, while igniting an oil tank. During this, &quot;Kormoran&quot; maintained heavy fire, and around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, a torpedo launched at the start of the engagement hit &quot;Sydney&quot; just forward of &quot;A&quot; turret and near the ASDIC compartment (the weakest point on the ship&#x27;s hull), ripping a hole in the side and causing the bow of the cruiser to angle down. Down by the bows, the cruiser swung hard to port, and passed behind &quot;Kormoran&quot;; during the turn, shells from the raider knocked &quot;B&quot; turret off &quot;Sydney&quot;.

By 17:35, &quot;Sydney&quot; was heading south and losing speed, wreathed in smoke from multiple fires. Her main armament was disabled (the two aft turrets had jammed on a port facing and could not be swung around), and her secondary guns were out of effective range. The cruiser continued to be hit by shells from &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s aft guns as the distance between the ships increased. The Germans reported that around 17:45, all four torpedoes from &quot;Sydney&quot;″s starboard launcher were fired, but as &quot;Kormoran&quot; was manoeuvring to bring her port broadside to bear, they all missed. In fact, only two torpedoes from &quot;Sydney&quot;″s port launcher were ever fired, which must have happened some time earlier. The raider&#x27;s engines broke down after this turn, but she continued to fire on &quot;Sydney&quot; at a high rate despite being immobilised, although many of the shells would have missed as the distance between the two ships increased. &quot;Kormoran&quot; ceased fire at 17:50, with the range at , and launched another torpedo at 18:00, but missed &quot;Sydney&quot;.

The Australian cruiser continued on a south-south-east heading at low speed; observers aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot; doubted that &quot;Sydney&quot; was under control. Although disappearing over the horizon shortly later, the glow from the damaged, burning warship was consistently seen by the Germans until about 22:00, and sporadically until midnight. At some point during the night, &quot;Sydney&quot; lost buoyancy and sank: the bow was torn off as she submerged and descended almost vertically, while the rest of the hull glided forward as she sank, hitting the bottom upright and stern first. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s shells had crippled &quot;Kormoran&quot;; the German sailors abandoned ship after it was determined that below-deck fires could not be controlled before they reached the gun magazines or the mines in the cargo hold. The raider was scuttled at midnight, and sank slowly until the mine deck exploded half an hour later.

===Aftermath===
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s failure to reach Fremantle on 20 November was not initially cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, none of which were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, with no sign of the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for &quot;Sydney&quot; to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November 318 survivors from &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from &quot;Sydney&quot; or the 645 aboard was recovered.
Australian Prime Minister John Curtin officially announced the loss of the cruiser during the afternoon of 30 November. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s destruction was a major blow to Australian morale and military capability: her ship&#x27;s company made up 35 percent of the RAN&#x27;s wartime casualties. The cruiser&#x27;s loss did not have the same impact internationally; Japan entered World War II with attacks on Pearl Harbor on 7 December, just over a week after &quot;Sydney&quot;″s loss was announced, and two British capital ships were destroyed within a fortnight, with the loss of Singapore following shortly after.

The German survivors were taken to Fremantle and interrogated. Attempts to learn what had happened were hampered by the German officers instructing their sailors to obfuscate the enemy with false answers, people describing events they did not witness but heard of later, and difficulty in keeping groups separated in order to check their stories against each other. Despite this, Australian authorities were able to piece together the broad details of the battle, which was verified by a group of German sailors who had been taken to Sydney instead: their interviews showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as those from Fremantle, and the interrogators concluded that the true story was being recounted. Interrogations were concluded in December, and by the end of January, &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s personnel had been moved to prisoner-of-war camps in Victoria, where they remained until their repatriation to Germany in early 1947.

On 6 February 1942, a Carley float containing a dead body was spotted just off Christmas Island and towed ashore. Examination of the raft and its occupant led the island&#x27;s inhabitants to believe that they were from &quot;Sydney&quot;. Although a 1949 investigation conducted by the Royal Navy stated the raft was not from HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot;, and while some historians agreed, others concluded that the raft and the body originated from &quot;Sydney&quot;. The body was exhumed in October 2006 and reburied at Geraldton Cemetery in November 2008, after DNA was extracted. On 19 November 2021, Australian Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs Andrew Gee announced that comparison of the extracted DNA with that of relatives of &quot;Sydney&quot; personnel had identified the sailor as Able Seaman Thomas Welsby Clark who had joined &quot;Sydney&quot; in August 1941, approximately four months before her sinking.

===Controversy===
The battle between &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Kormoran&quot; is seen as controversial: the disbelief that a modified merchant ship could so successfully defeat a cruiser combined with the lack of Australian survivors led some to believe that the German account was false. Rumours that the battle was not what it seemed had been around since &quot;Sydney&quot; failed to reach Fremantle on schedule in 1941, but several historians (including Tom Frame and Wesley Olson) credit Michael Montgomery and his 1980 book &quot;Who Sank The Sydney?&quot; with igniting the controversy.

The main claims made by supporters of an alternative view of the engagement include: that the Germans fired on &quot;Sydney&quot; before raising their battle ensign, or after using a flag of surrender or signals of distress to lure the cruiser in, that a Japanese submarine was partially or completely responsible for sinking &quot;Sydney&quot;, that the involvement of the Japanese was covered up to lure the United States into the war, and that Australian survivors were killed in the water to eliminate witnesses. Other claims, less widely heard, include a belief that &quot;Sydney&quot; was not at action stations and thus not prepared for &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s attack, distress calls from the cruiser were heard by Australian shore facilities but ignored, and that survivors were captured then executed by the Japanese.

These claims have been proven false by historians and researchers; the 1998 inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade concluded that the German accounts were a &quot;feasible&quot; interpretation of the battle, but there was no reliable evidence to support any of the alternative claims, while the 2009 report for the Cole Inquiry (the third volume of which was completely dedicated to the &quot;frauds, conspiracies and speculations&quot; surrounding the battle) found nothing to substantiate any of the theories raised.

In addition, most researchers have speculated as to why &quot;Sydney&quot; was so close to an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett&#x27;s actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or that he was trying to clearly identify the merchantman.

==Search and rediscovery==

Despite the approximate position of &quot;Kormoran&quot; being known (most German accounts giving the battle coordinates as ), the required search area for both ships was immense. Calculating a search area was complicated by the fact that several people distrusted the German location, and believed the ships would be found further south and closer to shore. Several attempts to bring supporters of the &#x27;northern&#x27; and &#x27;southern&#x27; positions to a consensus and narrow down the potential search area were unsuccessful.

Multiple searches were carried out by the RAN between 1974 and 1997 (using the survey ship and later the trials ship ), but efforts were restricted to the continental shelf, and were usually in response to civilian claims that they had found &quot;Sydney&quot; at a certain location. Other searches were conducted by RAAF aircraft carrying magnetometers; again, these were only in response to possible location claims. These searches failed to find either ship.

American shipwreck hunter David Mearns first learned of the battle in 1996, and began to study it as a prelude to a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and came to the conclusion that the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Kormoran&quot;. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.
Mearns&#x27; plan was to inspect a search box around the German location with a deep-water, towed side-scan sonar to locate &quot;Kormoran&quot;, after which the search team would be able to narrow down the search area for &quot;Sydney&quot;. After locating one or both vessels, the search ship (survey vessel SV &quot;Geosounder&quot;, chartered from the subsea exploration company DOF Subsea Australia) would return to port and replace the sonar with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to photograph and video the wrecks.

After problems with equipment and weather, &quot;Geosounder&quot; commenced the search, and located &quot;Kormoran&quot; on 12 March 2008 at . Using the newly discovered wreck and the accounts of the Germans describing &quot;Sydney&quot;″s heading, speed, and last sighting after the battle, a search box for the cruiser was calculated: the dramatically smaller area was due to the quality of information regarding &quot;Sydney&quot;″s position and heading in relation to &quot;Kormoran&quot;, while the raider&#x27;s location consisted of only broad coordinates.
&quot;Sydney&quot; was located on 17 March 2008 just after 11:00, only hours after &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s discovery was made public. News that the cruiser had been found was announced by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 18 March. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s wreck was located at at below sea level, south-east of the raider. The bow of the cruiser had broken off as the ship sank, and was located at the opposite end of a debris field stretching less than north-west from the hull, which was sitting upright on the ocean floor. On discovery, both wrecks were placed under the protection of the &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot;, which penalises anyone disturbing a protected shipwreck with a fine of up to A$10,000 or a maximum five years imprisonment. Both wrecks were placed on the Australian National Heritage List on 14 March 2011.

After the side-scan sonar aboard &quot;Geosounder&quot; was switched out for the ROV (again delayed by technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to &quot;Sydney&quot;″s wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study of the ship and her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on &quot;Kormoran&quot; and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.

==Awards, memorials, and legacy==
&quot;Sydney&quot; was granted the battle honour &quot;&quot;Kormoran&quot; 1941&quot; in recognition of the damage done to &quot;Kormoran&quot;. This was one of only three honours awarded during the 20th century for the sinking of a single ship, and the second to a ship named &quot;Sydney&quot; (the other had been awarded to the previous &quot;Sydney&quot; for her defeat of the German light cruiser SMS &quot;Emden&quot; at the Battle of Cocos).
The main memorial for the loss of &quot;Sydney&quot; is located at Geraldton, Western Australia, on top of Mount Scott. Planning for the memorial commenced in late 1997, after a speech by &quot;Sydney&quot; researcher Glenys McDonald at the local Rotary club. The first, temporary memorial (consisting of a large boulder, a flagpole, and a bronze plaque), was installed prior to 19 November 1998, and was used in a remembrance ceremony that year. During the playing of the Last Post, a large flock of seagulls flew over the participants and headed out to sea in formation: this became a major feature of the permanent memorial. The permanent memorial included four major elements: a stele of the same size and shape of the ship&#x27;s prow, a granite wall listing the ship&#x27;s company, a bronze statue of a woman looking out to sea and waiting in vain for the cruiser to come home, and a dome (dubbed the &quot;dome of souls&quot;) onto which 645 stainless steel seagulls were welded.

The memorial (minus the stele, which had not been completed in time) was dedicated on 18 November 2001, and was used the next evening for a commemoration ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the ship&#x27;s loss. In May 2009, the memorial was recognised by the Australian government as being of national significance. By 2011, the stele had been completed, and a fifth element—a pool of remembrance containing a map of the region and the marked position of &quot;Sydney&quot;″s wreck—had been added.
Other memorials commemorating the loss of &quot;Sydney&quot; include an oak tree planted at the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance, and an avenue in Carnarvon lined with 645 trees. The service of &quot;Sydney&quot;, along with the other ships of the same name, is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel, and by the mast of the first at Bradleys Head, New South Wales. The names of those killed aboard &quot;Sydney&quot; are inscribed at the Australian War Memorial.

In 2011 a memorial stone commemorating both the &quot;Sydney&quot; and the &quot;Kormoran&quot; was inaugurated by former Australian ambassador to Germany Peter Tesch at the Laboe Naval Memorial near Kiel, Germany.

The &quot;HMAS Sydney Replacement Fund&quot; was established to help finance the acquisition of a replacement ship. The AU£426,000 raised was contributed to the purchase of Australia&#x27;s first aircraft carrier in the late 1940s; the &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carrier was named upon her commissioning into the RAN in December 1948. This &quot;Sydney&quot; operated during the Korean War, then was modified into a troop transport and served in the Vietnam War, before her sale for scrap in 1973.

The Supermarine Seagull V aircraft that operated from &quot;Sydney&quot; between 1937 and 1938 still survives as part of the collection of the Royal Air Force Museum at Colindale in north London.

The &quot;HMAS Sydney II Cup&quot; was introduced in 2010 as a commemorative trophy competed for by two Australian Football League clubs, the Sydney Swans (representing the ship&#x27;s namesake) and the West Coast Eagles (representing the site of the ship&#x27;s loss), in an annual match. The trophy is based on the cruiser&#x27;s battle honour board, while the design of a Best On Ground trophy for the match&#x27;s best player is based on a shell casing from the frigate &quot;Sydney&quot;.

<text>HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; (R17/A214/P214/L134) was a light aircraft carrier operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was built for the Royal Navy and was launched as HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; (93) in 1944, but was not completed before the end of World War II. The carrier was sold to Australia in 1947, completed, and commissioned into the RAN as &quot;Sydney&quot; in 1948.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was the first of three conventional aircraft carriers to serve in the RAN, and operated as the navy&#x27;s flagship during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the Korean War, making her the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion, and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a training vessel following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, , &quot;Sydney&quot; remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as surplus to requirements.

The need for a sealift capability saw the ship modified for service as a fast troop transport, and recommissioned in 1962. &quot;Sydney&quot; was initially used for training and a single supply run in support of Malaysia&#x27;s defence policy against Indonesia, but in 1965, she sailed on the first voyage to Vũng Tàu, transporting soldiers and equipment to serve in the Vietnam War. 25 voyages to Vietnam were made between 1965 and 1972, earning the ship the nickname &quot;Vung Tau Ferry&quot;.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was decommissioned in 1973, and was not replaced. Despite several plans to preserve all or part of the ship as a maritime museum, tourist attraction, or car park, the carrier was sold to a South Korean steel mill for scrapping in 1975.

==Design==

&quot;Sydney&quot; was one of six light fleet carriers; a modified version of the carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. These two classes of carriers were intended to be &#x27;disposable warships&#x27;: they were to be operated during World War II and scrapped at the end of hostilities or within three years of entering service. &quot;Sydney&quot; was the second ship of the class to enter service, following Canadian aircraft carrier .

The carrier had a standard displacement of 15,740 tons, and a deep displacement of 19,550 tons. Her length was between perpendiculars and at her longest point, with a beam of and a draught of . &quot;Sydney&quot; was fitted with four Admiralty 3-drum boilers, which provided steam to Parsons single reduction geared turbines; these supplied to the two propeller shafts, and allowed the ship to reach . The average size of the ship&#x27;s company in peacetime was 1,100, but could be increased to 1,300 for wartime deployments. Refitting the ship to serve as a transport reduced the standard displacement to 14,380 tons and the ship&#x27;s company to a core of 544, which was supplemented by trainees and personnel from the Royal Australian Navy Reserve when required.
The British Admiralty predicted that all &quot;Majestic&quot;-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear in the early 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade &quot;Sydney&quot; to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed &quot;Sydney&quot; to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.

===Armament, sensors, and aircraft===
&quot;Sydney&quot; was initially armed with thirty Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns: eighteen single mountings and six twin mountings. During her refit as a troop transport, the carrier&#x27;s armament was reduced to four single Bofors.

The radar suite included two Type 277Q height-finding sets, one Type 293M surface search set, one Type 960/281BQ long-range air warning set, and one Type 961 air search set.

As an aircraft carrier, &quot;Sydney&quot; operated with the RAN Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s 20th and 21st Carrier Air Groups (CAGs), which were assigned alternately to the carrier. The former was made up of 805 and 816 Squadrons, while the latter was made up of 808 and 817 Squadrons. Twenty-four aircraft, split evenly between Hawker Sea Fury fighters and Fairey Firefly attack aircraft, were normally carried. Two Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious aircraft were carried for rescue duties (but were never required for this purpose); they were not attached to any squadron, but operated as the &#x27;Ship&#x27;s Flight&#x27;. The amphibians were removed from the ship at the start of her Korean War deployment, and were replaced by a helicopter. During the carrier&#x27;s Korean War deployment, 805 Squadron was added to the 21st CAG to form a 38-strong wartime air group.

While undergoing conversion into a troop transport, the ability to operate aircraft was removed from &quot;Sydney&quot;. However, on seven of the troopship&#x27;s twenty-five voyages to Vietnam, she carried a flight of four Westland Wessex helicopters, sourced from either 725 or 817 Squadron, for anti-submarine surveillance.

==Construction and acquisition==
The ship was laid down by HM Dockyard Devonport in England as HMS &quot;Terrible&quot; on 19 April 1943, with the Viscountess Astor presiding over the ceremony. She was the only aircraft carrier of the &quot;Colossus&quot; or &quot;Majestic&quot; classes to be constructed in a &#x27;royal dockyard&#x27;: a dockyard owned and operated by the Royal Navy. She was launched on 30 September 1944 by the wife of British politician Duncan Sandys. Work on the ship continued until the end of World War II, when the Admiralty ordered the suspension of all warship construction.
A post-war review by the Australian government&#x27;s Defence Committee recommended that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; &quot;Terrible&quot; and sister ship &quot;Majestic&quot;, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As &quot;Terrible&quot; was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although &quot;Terrible&quot; was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected the installation of the ship&#x27;s boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the delivery date to October 1948.

A commissioning crew for the aircraft carrier was raised in Australia from the ship&#x27;s company of the decommissioned cruiser , which departed from Sydney aboard in June 1948. Ex-Royal Navy sailors were used to fill out the carrier&#x27;s complement. &quot;Terrible&quot; was handed over to the RAN on 16 December 1948, and was commissioned at noon as HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot;. One of the reasons behind the choice in name was so AU£426,000 raised by the HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; Replacement Fund after the loss of the light cruiser HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; in 1941 could be accessed. &quot;Sydney&quot; was the last vessel to be commissioned into the RAN as &#x27;His&#x27; Majesty&#x27;s Australian Ship: as after the death of King George VI on 6 February 1952 and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, all RAN ships became &#x27;Her&#x27; Majesty&#x27;s.

==Operational history==

===1949–1951===

Although commissioned in mid-December 1948, &quot;Sydney&quot; did not enter service until 5 February 1949, as work was still being completed. On 25 December 1948, while still fitting out in Devonport, a helicopter from carrying Santa Claus became the first aircraft to land on &quot;Sydney&quot;″s flight deck. The ship&#x27;s sea trials and post-commissioning workup were not without event: in early December 1948, a 771 Naval Air Squadron de Havilland Mosquito crashed while helping &quot;Sydney&quot; calibrate her radar suite, killing both British aircrew, and a RAN pilot undergoing landing qualifications aboard on 17 March 1949 crashed while attempting to land: none were killed, but the pilot&#x27;s Fairey Firefly and four others in the deck park were destroyed.
The carrier sailed from Devonport on 12 April 1949, carrying the 20th CAG. &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived at Jervis Bay on 25 May, where the aircraft of the 20th CAG and training equipment were offloaded for transport to the new naval air station, , before the carrier proceeded to her namesake city. &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Sydney on 2 June, and took over as Flagship of the Australian Fleet from on 25 August. 20th CAG was reembarked during August, and &quot;Sydney&quot; exercised in Australian and New Guinea waters until late November. From January to April 1950, the carrier continued training exercises and visited ports in south-east Australia and New Zealand, and on 7 June, she departed for England to collect the 21st CAG. The 21st CAG embarked in October, and the carrier returned to Australia in December. Before &quot;Sydney&quot; departed in late October, the British Admiralty suggested that she be deployed to the Korean War as relief for and her worn-out catapult, but this was withdrawn because of the plan&#x27;s drawbacks.

On 29 January 1951, &quot;Sydney&quot; was part of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australia&#x27;s Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by &quot;Sydney&quot;″s radio aerials could trigger a Fury&#x27;s firing circuits. &quot;Sydney&quot; was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier&#x27;s first fatality.

===Korean War (1951–1952)===
In March 1951, the First Sea Lord requested that &quot;Sydney&quot; be deployed to Korea while was refitted in Australia, to maintain a Commonwealth carrier presence. This was agreed to, and a 38-strong wartime CAG was formed on 14 May by incorporating the Sea Furies of 805 Squadron into the 21st CAG. Because RAN Fireflies were optimised for anti-submarine warfare, and consequently not fitted with cannon, cannon-equipped RN aircraft were loaned for the duration of &quot;Sydney&quot;″s deployment. After completing pre-departure exercises, during which several aircraft were destroyed in non-fatal, weather-induced deck crashes, &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer sailed for Korea on 31 August. While en route, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft were used for a fly-past demonstration over Rabaul on 6 September, following civil unrest. On her arrival, &quot;Sydney&quot; became the first aircraft carrier owned by a Commonwealth dominion to see wartime service.
&quot;Sydney&quot; was attached to the United States Navy (USN) Seventh Fleet and assigned to Task Element 95.11, which operated primarily off the western coast of Korea. The carrier was sent on nine or ten-day patrols in the operational area, with nine-day replenishment periods in Sasebo, Nagasaki or Kure, Hiroshima between each; to maintain coverage, &quot;Sydney&quot; alternated with a USN carrier (initially , then from December with ). RAN aircraft were mainly used for air strikes against North Korean units and supply lines; secondary duties including reconnaissance, bombardment spotting, combat air patrols, and anti-submarine patrols. During her deployment, the carrier operated an unarmed USN Sikorsky Dragonfly (designation UP28, which acquired the nickname &quot;Uncle Peter&quot;) in the search-and-rescue and plane guard roles. This was the first helicopter to operate from an Australian warship, and the first USN equipment used by the RAN. The success of helicopter operations convinced the RAN to acquire three Bristol Sycamores; the first helicopter squadron in Australian military service.
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s first patrol commenced on 4 October, with two days spent providing air support of efforts to push the front line away from the Han River. &quot;Sydney&quot; was then briefly repositioned off the east coast, where her aircraft flew strike missions near Wonsan. After returning to the east coast, &quot;Sydney&quot; set a record on 11 October for light carrier operations: her aircraft flew 89 sorties during the day, with 31 aircraft aloft at one point. Following her first patrol, the carrier sailed to Sasebo to resupply, but on 14 October, all ships were ordered to sea to avoid Typhoon Ruth. Although the order to clear the anchorage was given that morning, the number of ships present meant &quot;Sydney&quot; did not leave until late in the day, and sailed during the worst part of the storm. A Firefly, a motor dinghy, and a forklift were lost overboard, six other aircraft parked on the deck were destroyed, and the carrier experienced extreme winds—the wind recorder broke after registering .
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s second patrol began on 18 October, with her aircraft involved in strikes against North Korean units, coastal shipping, railway bridges, and other supply routes. They also performed their first close air support mission on 21 October, providing cover for the 1st Commonwealth Division. Two Sea Furies were shot down on 25 October; both pilots escaped unharmed. The next day, during a moderately successful strike involving five RAN aircraft against a railway tunnel, a Firefly was shot down inland, deep inside North Korean territory. There were doubts that a rescue helicopter could reach the crash site and return safely, as it was at the extreme limit of helicopter range and some of the return flight would occur after dark. Despite this, Uncle Peter&#x27;s USN aircrew volunteered to try, and after the observer was quickly taught how to use an Owen submachine gun, the helicopter launched at 16:22. The four RAN aircraft provided cover for the two downed personnel until they were ordered to return to the carrier; two of the Fireflies met Uncle Peter at 17:15, and turned around to escort the helicopter. At 17:33 Uncle Peter arrived at the crash site and collected the RAN aircrew, with covering fire provided by the escorting Fireflies and the helicopter&#x27;s observer. All three aircraft were at extreme fuel limits on their return: the two Fireflies barely made it back to &quot;Sydney&quot;, while Uncle Peter arrived at Kimpo air base at 18:30 and had to land with the aid of truck headlights. The rescue was the longest helicopter rescue transit over North Korean territory during the war, and Sikorsky pilot received both the British Distinguished Service Medal and the United States Navy Cross: the only instance of these two medals being awarded to the same person for the same action. &quot;Sydney&quot; was relieved by USS &quot;Rendova&quot; on 27 October and returned to Kure.
&quot;Sydney&quot; began her third patrol on 5 November, operating on the west coast of Korea and escorted by the Canadian destroyers , and , and American destroyers and . On the same day, the first RAN casualty of the war occurred, when a Sea Fury pilot failed to pull up from a strafing run and crashed. Despite foul weather, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft continued to attack lines of supply and communication, and provide support to United Nations ships: the 1000th combat sortie was flown on 12 November, a day before the patrol&#x27;s end. On 18 November, after replenishing in Sasebo, &quot;Sydney&quot;, &quot;Tobruk&quot;, and the British light cruiser sailed to Hŭngnam, where they joined Task Force 95.8 to aid a USN bombardment of Hŭngnam during 20–22 November. On that day, &quot;Sydney&quot; was being refuelled by when there was an accident that resulted in a large spill of fuel and damage to &quot;Wave Chief&quot;″s refuelling rig. Aircraft from &quot;Sydney&quot; performed strikes against coastal artillery batteries, barracks, industrial areas and railway lines, and provided a combat air patrol for the ships. At the conclusion of the operation, &quot;Sydney&quot; returned to the west coast, but was unable to resume operations because of snow and high winds until 27 November, a day before being relieved.

In December, UN Command temporarily switched some of the responsibilities of Task Element 95.11 and the US Fifth Air Force. Consequently, &quot;Sydney&quot; was required to provide air support for convoys between Japan and Korea amongst the other duties of her fifth patrol, which commenced on 7 December. On 8 December, a second RAN pilot was killed; although he successfully bailed out of his flak-damaged Sea Fury, he was struck by the tail of the aircraft and died from wounds. Four other aircraft were damaged that day. Clear weather, which lasted until 14 December, allowed the carrier to maintain a high rate of attack against North Korean troop concentrations, railways, and coastal vessels, while providing air cover for the Task Element. Ending on 18 December, the fifth patrol was the most costly to &quot;Sydney&quot;″s CAG, with one pilot killed, five aircraft destroyed, and another 25 aircraft heavily damaged. The carrier was in Kure for Christmas, and relieved USS &quot;Badoeng Strait&quot; on 27 December, the start of her sixth patrol. The remaining days of 1951 were spent providing air cover in the Inchon area for both UN ground forces and supply convoys returning to Japan. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1952, &quot;Sydney&quot;″s aircraft helped repel the North Korean invasion of the island of Yongho Do. The third RAN pilot to be lost in Korea died on 2 January while performing a combat air patrol around the carrier; personnel on the flight deck saw the aircraft fly into a cloud, but not emerge. No wreckage was found, and it was assumed that the plane dived into the Yellow Sea. For most of the patrol, RAN aircraft attacked artillery emplacements and concentrations of junks in the Cho Do-Sok To area, while also proving air support for South Korean Army and irregular forces.
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s seventh and final patrol commenced on 16 January, with HMAS &quot;Tobruk&quot;, HMCS &quot;Sioux&quot;, and accompanying. This patrol was marked by minimal flying activity due to extremely poor weather and a lack of co-ordination between UN forces and the convoys RAN aircraft were meant to escort. The primary targets for strike missions were changed from North Korean supply line infrastructure to water towers, as they took longer to repair. On the final day of the patrol, aircraft from &quot;Sydney&quot; did not fly at all, as overnight weather conditions had rendered all of the deck-parked aircraft unusable, including five which were completely encased in frozen sea water. On 25 January, &quot;Sydney&quot; was relieved by HMS &quot;Glory&quot;, and sailed for home.

&quot;Sydney&quot; completed seven patrols during her 122-day Korean deployment: flying operations were conducted for 42.8 days, poor weather stopped operations for 11.7 days, transits to and from the operational area or between assignments consumed 29.5 days, and 38 days were spent in harbour. During this time, RAN Sea Furies flew 1,623 sorties, while the Fireflies flew 743, with the aircraft using 802 bombs, 6,359 rockets, and 269,249 rounds of ammunition between them. Three RAN pilots were killed and a fourth seriously wounded, while thirteen aircraft were lost: nine shot down by North Korean flak artillery (which damaged aircraft on over ninety other occasions), and four to deck accidents or foul weather. Replacement aircraft were loaned from British Far East reserve supplies.

RAN aircraft damaged or destroyed an estimated 66 bridges, 141 pieces of rolling stock, over 2,000 structures, 469 watercraft, and 15 artillery pieces, while causing over 3,100 North Korean casualties. Australian damage assessment practice was considered to be conservative, and claims of great underestimation by the RAN were made by US personnel inspecting the aftermath of RAN attacks. Personnel from &quot;Sydney&quot; and her CAG received four Distinguished Service Crosses (one with Bar), one Distinguished Service Medal, ten Mentions in Despatches, and two United States Legions of Merit. Most of the personnel aboard would have been eligible for the Australian Active Service Medal, the Korea Medal, the United Nations Service Medal for Korea, and the Returned From Active Service Badge, while &quot;Sydney&quot; herself was awarded the battle honour &quot;Korea 1951–52&quot;. The carrier&#x27;s presence in Korea allowed the Australian government to avoid deploying additional Australian soldiers.

===1952–1958===
During her return from Korea, &quot;Sydney&quot; ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia. After a brief refit, &quot;Sydney&quot; embarked the 20th CAG in June 1952, before proceeding on a round-Australia cruise. The carrier visited Manus Island, was present off the coast of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived back in her namesake city in November. On 25 March 1953, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed for England with representatives from each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet Review on 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August. The carrier&#x27;s 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while &quot;Sydney&quot; was en route to Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Sydney&quot; left Fremantle on 27 October 1953 for a second deployment to Korea, to support United Nations enforcement of the July 1953 armistice. This deployment, which concluded in January 1954, was mostly uneventful compared to the first, with flight operations limited to patrols along the demilitarised zone established by the armistice. During operations in Korea, one pilot died when his Sea Fury crashed into the ocean, while another pilot was killed and an aircraft handler seriously injured in separate deck accidents. &quot;Sydney&quot; returned to Fremantle on 2 June 1954. A planned upgrade of &quot;Sydney&quot; to a similar standard as modified sister ship &quot;Melbourne&quot; was cancelled in 1954, and she was prepared for service as a training ship. The carrier&#x27;s embarked aircraft were flown off for the last time on 22 April 1955, and &quot;Sydney&quot; underwent a brief reorganisation during 26–29 April. Not long after, she departed for New Zealand waters on her first training cruise on 2 May. This was followed by a refit and then a quick trip from Sydney to Adelaide, thence Melbourne, and back to her home port in Sydney. A visit by Earl Mountbatten of Burma was a highlight at this time – especially when, after his presentation to the ship&#x27;s company, they were all granted a &#x27;make and mend.&#x27;
On 1 May 1956, &quot;Sydney&quot; met &quot;Melbourne&quot; off Kangaroo Island during the latter&#x27;s delivery voyage. The two carriers sailed together for the remainder of &quot;Melbourne&quot;″s delivery voyage, visiting Melbourne and Jervis Bay before arriving in Sydney on 10 May. Three days later, the flagship role was transferred from &quot;Sydney&quot; to &quot;Melbourne&quot;. After this, &quot;Sydney&quot; continued on a program of training cruises throughout Australian and New Zealand waters, and visited the Far East Strategic Reserve to participate in a South East Asia Treaty Organisation multi-fleet exercise during September and October 1956. Following an appraisal process by the RAN, during which &quot;Sydney&quot;″s potential usefulness as a commando carrier, aircraft transport, or troopship was considered, the ship was paid off into Special Reserve on 30 May 1958 as surplus to requirements. &quot;Sydney&quot; could be reactivated for use as a transport, but required at least four months notice.

===Fast Troop Transport (1958–1965) conversion===
From 1958 to 1960, opinion within the Australian military swung between reactivating &quot;Sydney&quot; as a fast troop transport ship and disposing of her. The Australian Army saw the need for such a vessel, particularly if war broke out in Southeast Asia: Australian forces would need to be rapidly deployed to the conflict, and sealift was the only way to effectively move the required number of personnel, equipment, and vehicles. However, the RAN did not want the cost of converting and maintaining &quot;Sydney&quot; coming from their share of the defence budget, as they felt there was no further use for her. As both strategic airlift and sealift with other naval or civilian vessels were unfeasible, &quot;Sydney&quot; was reactivated and converted into a fast troop transport ship during 1961 and 1962. All of her aircraft operating equipment was removed, her hangar was converted into accommodation and storage, and her armament was reduced to four single-mounted 40 mm Bofors. &quot;Sydney&quot; was recommissioned as a Fast Troop Transport on 7 March 1962, given the pennant number A214, and assigned back to the training squadron. From April 1962 onwards, &quot;Sydney&quot; was used to train the ship&#x27;s company and Army personnel for the troop transport role, while supplementing the RAN&#x27;s regular training needs. The troopship first saw full use in her new role in August 1963, when she was used to support an amphibious landing at Hervey Bay, Queensland during Exercise Carbine.

====Whitsunday tragedy====
From 27 September to 4 October, &quot;Sydney&quot; conveyed the Governor-General of Australia, Viscount De L&#x27;Isle, on a tour of Norfolk and Lord Howe Islands. The ship then departed on a training cruise to northern Queensland, during which five personnel drowned in the Whitsunday Islands. Over several days, groups of trainee officers and sailors had been ordered to take one of the ship&#x27;s whaleboats on a twelve-hour voyage around Hayman and Hooke Islands; out of the sight of both the carrier and her escort, the destroyer . The third group boat left &quot;Sydney&quot; at around 0500 hours on 17 October with a midshipman and four trainee sailors aboard, and was believed to have capsized four to five hours later. Despite poor weather, &quot;Sydney&quot;″s captain had declined an offer by &quot;Anzac&quot;″s captain for the destroyer to move to the north of Hayman Island in case of incident, and a search party was not sent until after the boat failed to return at 1900 hours. A Board of Inquiry was held aboard &quot;Sydney&quot;, which resulted in the ship&#x27;s captain, executive officer, and training officer facing courts-martial. The latter two were acquitted, and although the captain was found guilty on one of the charges brought against him, it was dropped on a technicality relating to the wording of the charge.

===First overseas deployment as a transport===
&quot;Sydney&quot;″s first overseas deployment as a transport was to Southeast Asia in 1964. In late May, the ship was loaded with supplies and munitions for Malaysian forces in support of the country&#x27;s defence policy against Indonesia. In total, 1,245 personnel were also embarked: engineers from the 7th Field Squadron, the Royal Australian Artillery&#x27;s 111th Light Anti-aircraft Battery, and four UH-1 Iroquois helicopters plus associated air- and ground crew from No. 5 Squadron RAAF. &quot;Sydney&quot; departed Garden Island just after midnight on 24 May. After entering New Guinea waters, the ship was put on high alert; radio and radar silence was enforced, while the anti-aircraft guns of the 111th Battery were secured to the ship&#x27;s deck to supplement her armament. &quot;Sydney&quot; met the destroyer escorts and off the Philippines on 3 June, and a day later, the ships arrived at Kota Kinabalu, where the 7th Field Squadron was offloaded with the aid of the Australian Army landing ships and . &quot;Sydney&quot; and her companions left for Singapore at midnight on 5 June, and arrived three days later to offload 250 tonnes of ammunition. &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Parramatta&quot; then proceeded to Penang, where the 111th Battery, No. 5 Squadron, defence stores, and more munitions were offloaded during 16–17 June. The return voyage to Australia was interrupted on the morning of 23 June by the detection of a suspected Indonesian submarine: the two Australian ships performed evasion tactics for eighteen hours before resuming the voyage to Fremantle. No awards were issued to &quot;Sydney&quot; for operating in support of Malaysia during her service life, but a reorganisation of RAN battle honours published in March 2010 saw the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964&quot; retroactively awarded to the ship.

===Vietnam War (1965–1972)===

The main feature of the second half of &quot;Sydney&quot;″s career was the twenty-five voyages the ship made to South Vietnam in support of the 1st Australian Task Force between May 1965 and November 1972. &quot;Sydney&quot;, along with the civilian vessels and , was used to transport the majority of the Australian personnel and equipment contributed to the Vietnam War effort. These voyages earned &quot;Sydney&quot; the nickname &quot;Vung Tau Ferry&quot;. The visits to Vietnam were interspersed by other duties, and &quot;Sydney&quot; continued to function as a training ship, with up to 30 midshipmen and 200 trainee sailors aboard at any given time.


&quot;Sydney&quot; normally transported 450 soldiers—the main force of a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion—plus equipment and vehicles on each voyage. The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to the hangar. Vehicles were secured to the flight deck, while other cargo was packed onto pallets and stored either in the hangar or on the flight deck. Although it was originally intended that &quot;Sydney&quot; would sail to and from Saigon, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer at the time of the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after &quot;Sydney&quot; had sailed up. Instead, the port of Vũng Tàu was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges. During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to &quot;Sydney&quot; (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced this to a single day by 1968.

Because of the perceived threat from Chinese submarines while in transit and from Viet Cong swimmers with limpet mines while in harbour, &quot;Sydney&quot; was always escorted by at least one other RAN vessel. While in harbour, boats from &quot;Sydney&quot; and her escort would patrol around the troopship, while divers regularly inspected the hull, propellers, and anchor chain for explosives. On seven voyages, &quot;Sydney&quot; carried four Westland Wessex helicopters for anti-submarine surveillance, sourced from 725 or 817 Squadron.

During May 1965, &quot;Sydney&quot; was undergoing a refit at Garden Island, when she was ordered to prepare the ship for her first voyage to Vietnam. The refit was hastily completed, and cargo loading started on 23 May. A blanket media ban concerning the ship was issued, and soldiers of 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Light Horse armoured regiment, along with a logistics unit and a group of journalists were covertly transported to the ship on 26 May to foil any protest attempts. &quot;Sydney&quot; began her departure at 01:39; leaving Sydney Harbour with only her navigational lights lit. The troopship was in Vũng Tàu from 8 to 11 June, and returned to Fremantle on 26 June. &quot;Sydney&quot; was escorted by the destroyer for the entire voyage, and was joined by HMA Ships , , and for parts of the voyage. After loading troops and equipment in both Sydney and Brisbane, the troopship, accompanied by &quot;Melbourne&quot; and &quot;Anzac&quot;, started her second voyage on 14 September. &quot;Sydney&quot; was handed off to &quot;Duchess&quot; and off Manus Island six days later. The three ships reached Vũng Tàu on 28 September, and departed two days later: after clearing the Market Time area, the two destroyers headed for Hong Kong, while &quot;Sydney&quot; proceeded to Subic Bay, then to her namesake city, where she arrived on 20 October. Despite these deployments, &quot;Sydney&quot; was later presented the Gloucester Cup for 1966; being the most efficient vessel in the RAN that year.

&quot;Sydney&quot; sailed to Vietnam for the third time on 24 April 1966, with units from both 5 RAR and 6 RAR aboard. She met her escorts, &quot;Vampire&quot;, , and &quot;Melbourne&quot; en route: the two smaller ships accompanied &quot;Sydney&quot; into Vũng Tàu from 4 to 6 May, while the aircraft carrier &quot;Melbourne&quot; left the group as soon as they reached the Vietnam operational area. &quot;Sydney&quot; and her escorts arrived in Hong Kong on 9 May, with the troopship returning to Sydney on her own on 18 May. On 25 May, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed on her fourth voyage to Vietnam, with the remaining units of 5 RAR and 6 RAR aboard, plus equipment and personnel of No. 9 Squadron RAAF. Carrying the remaining units of 5 RAR and 6 RAR, plus equipment and personnel of No. 9 Squadron RAAF and escorted by &quot;Yarra&quot;, &quot;Melbourne&quot;, &quot;Derwent&quot;, and &quot;Vendetta&quot; for varying sections of the voyage, &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Vũng Tàu on 6 June. The voyage officially ended with the arrival of &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Vendetta&quot; in Hong Kong on 11 June. In November, &quot;Sydney&quot; provided assistance to the submarine , which ran aground on Frederick Reef.

On 1 March 1967, the ensign flown by RAN ships was changed from the British White Ensign to the Australian White Ensign. &quot;Sydney&quot; became one of only two RAN ships to undergo wartime service under both ensigns—the other being —and the only RAN ship to fly two ensigns during the same conflict. With 7 RAR embarked, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed her namesake city on 8 April for her fifth voyage to Vietnam. With &quot;Vampire&quot; escorting and Westland Wessex helicopters aboard for the first time, the troopship spent 20 April disembarking 7 RAR in Vũng Tàu before arriving in Singapore two days later. On 28 April, the two ships left Singapore on the sixth voyage, to collect 5 RAR. The battalion was embarked on 30 April, with &quot;Sydney&quot; arriving home on 12 May. Although the fifth and six voyages are officially recorded separately, they are sometimes counted as a single trip, because &quot;Sydney&quot; did not return to Australia in between.

&quot;Sydney&quot;″s seventh voyage began on 19 May from Brisbane, with 2 RAR and a company from 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment—the first New Zealand infantry force sent to Vietnam. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer escort &quot;Stuart&quot; reached Vũng Tàu on 30 May, where the troopship&#x27;s passengers were offloaded by Chinook helicopters and replaced by 6 RAR. The ships left Vietnam on the same day, and arrived in Brisbane on 14 June. The eighth voyage required &quot;Sydney&quot; to transport 3 RAR from Adelaide. Departing on 20 December, &quot;Sydney&quot; was met by &quot;Yarra&quot; en route, with the two ships arriving in Vietnam on 27 December, and returning to Fremantle on 3 January 1968.

On 17 January 1968, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed Sydney on her ninth voyage to Vietnam. Meeting &quot;Stuart&quot; off Singapore on 25 January, the two ships visited Sattahip, Thailand on 31 January before continuing on to Vietnam. &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Vũng Tàu on 3 February, and departed the same day for home; arriving in Sydney on 16 February. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s tenth voyage began on 27 March, with 1 RAR embarked for their second Vietnam deployment, and the destroyer escort &quot;Parramatta&quot; meeting the troopship off Singapore. The battalion was delivered to Vũng Tàu on 9 April, with 7 RAR on board for the return to Australia, where they arrived on 26 April. The eleventh voyage saw &quot;Sydney&quot;, with the destroyer &quot;Anzac&quot; escorting, depart Brisbane on 21 May with 4 RAR aboard. The ships arrived at Vũng Tàu on 1 June, where the battalion was replaced by 2 RAR for the return voyage to Brisbane, which was reached on 13 June. After this voyage, &quot;Sydney&quot; underwent an extensive refit in which she was fitted with three new Favelle Favco-type cargo cranes and modified to carry six Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM (6)) on davits. 16 LCM were constructed for use with &quot;Sydney&quot;, but half were put up for sale in the early 1970s. During September and October, &quot;Sydney&quot; temporarily resumed flagship duties, and participated in the amphibious warfare exercise Coral Sands. After the exercise, the troopship undertook a training cruise to New Zealand. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s twelfth voyage was to deliver 9 RAR to Vietnam. The troopship sailed from Fremantle on 13 November, and met the destroyer &quot;Duchess&quot; off Singapore on 18 November. 9 RAR was delivered to Vũng Tàu on 20 November, while 3 RAR and a damaged de Havilland Caribou were loaded for the return trip, which concluded in Fremantle on 28 November.

At the start of 1969, the RAN&#x27;s ship designation and numbering system was altered from the British pennant system to a new system based on the United States&#x27; hull classifications: &quot;Sydney&quot; was assigned the pennant number P214. The troopship began her thirteenth voyage on 8 February 1969, when she sailed from Fremantle with 5 RAR aboard. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer escort &quot;Derwent&quot; arrived in Vũng Tàu on 15 February and departed the same day with 1 RAR embarked, with the troopship reaching Townsville on 25 February. A training cruise in March saw the ship visit New Zealand and Fiji. &quot;Sydney&quot;″s fourteenth voyage, to deliver 6 RAR to Vietnam and return with 4 RAR, commenced on 8 May when &quot;Sydney&quot; sailed from Townsville. She met the destroyer &quot;Vampire&quot; off Singapore on 14 May, reached Vũng Tàu five days later, and arrived back in Brisbane on 30 May. On 17 November, &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Duchess&quot; departed Brisbane on the troopship&#x27;s fifteenth voyage to Vietnam, with 8 RAR aboard. The ships reached Vũng Tàu on 28 November; 8 RAR was replaced by 9 RAR, which was delivered to Fremantle on 5 December.

&quot;Sydney&quot;, with 7 RAR on board, and the destroyer escort &quot;Yarra&quot; departed from Sydney for the sixteenth voyage on 16 February 1970. They arrived in Vietnam on 27 February, with &quot;Sydney&quot; embarking 5 RAR for the voyage to Fremantle, where they arrived on 5 March. On 16 April, &quot;Sydney&quot; was one of 45 vessels from 13 nations assembled in Sydney Harbour to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary, marking James Cook&#x27;s discovery of the east coast of Australia. Later that month, a visit to Portland, Victoria coincided with the Bicentenary Royal Tour of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. &quot;Sydney&quot; sailed from Fremantle on 21 October on the seventeenth voyage to Vietnam. The troopship met the destroyer &quot;Vendetta&quot; off Manila, and reached Vietnam on 31 October, where 2 RAR was offloaded and 8 RAR embarked. The two ships departed a day later, with &quot;Sydney&quot; reaching Brisbane on 12 November. At the start of February 1971, the troopship visited Hobart to serve as the flagship of the Royal Hobart Regatta, before she sailed to Adelaide, embarked 3 RAR, then departed on her eighteenth Vietnam voyage on 15 February. &quot;Sydney&quot; met the destroyer escort &quot;Yarra&quot; en route, with both ships reaching Vũng Tàu on 25 February, where 7 RAR boarded for the return voyage. On 2 March, two days before reaching Fremantle, the ashes of Rear Admiral Harold Farncomb were scattered from &quot;Sydney&quot;.
&quot;Sydney&quot; sailed again from Adelaide on 26 March for her nineteenth voyage, carrying general cargo and foreign aid supplies for the Khmer Republic. She met the destroyer &quot;Duchess&quot; off Singapore on 3 April, and the two ships arrived in Vũng Tàu on 5 April. The voyage officially ended when &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot; arrived in Hong Kong on 8 April, and after a short period of recreational leave, the troopship returned to Australia. The twentieth voyage saw &quot;Sydney&quot; sail from Townsville on 13 May, with 4 RAR embarked. She met &quot;Duchess&quot; and &quot;Parramatta&quot; en route, and reached Vũng Tàu on 22 May. The ships left a day later, with 2 RAR aboard for the voyage home. &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Townsville on 1 June. In July 1971, &quot;Sydney&quot; sailed to Esquimalt, British Columbia, for Canada&#x27;s centennial naval assembly. She then visited San Diego to collect ten new A-4G Skyhawk aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm, and delivered these to Australia in mid-August. On 20 September, &quot;Sydney&quot; departed on the twenty-first voyage to Vietnam. The troopship first sailed to Singapore, where she offloaded equipment for the ANZUK force and met the destroyer escort &quot;Swan&quot;. The two ships were in Vũng Tàu for 6–7 October, during which 3 RAR was heli-lifted to &quot;Sydney&quot; for return to Australia, with the troopship arriving in Adelaide on 16 October. Ten days later, &quot;Sydney&quot; sailed from her namesake city for her twenty-second visit to Vietnam, with a cargo of Defence Aid stores. Meeting the destroyer escort &quot;Derwent&quot; en route, &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Vũng Tàu on 6 November, where the stores were offloaded and replaced by Australian personnel and equipment from assorted units over a two-day period. Arriving back in Sydney, the troopship left again on 24 November for her twenty-third voyage to Vietnam. &quot;Sydney&quot; met &quot;Swan&quot; off Subic Bay, then arrived in Vũng Tàu on 8 December, where 4 RAR, the 104th Battalion of the Royal Australian Artillery, and No. 9 Squadron were embarked for the return to Australia. The ship was visited by South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu before departing, who thanked the efforts of the Australian military during the Vietnam War. &quot;Sydney&quot; arrived in Townsville on 17 December.

&quot;Sydney&quot; left for her twenty-fourth voyage to Vietnam on 14 February 1972; the troopship and the destroyer escort reached Vũng Tàu on 28 February, where 457 Australian soldiers from various units boarded. They left the next day, and &quot;Sydney&quot; reached Townsville on 9 March before arriving in her namesake city three days later, concluding the military involvement of the RAN in the Vietnam War. &quot;Sydney&quot; underwent a refit between 22 May and 20 October, then departed on 1 November for her twenty-fifth journey to Vietnam, carrying defence equipment and foreign aid supplies for South Vietnam and the Khmer Republic. &quot;Sydney&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Vampire&quot; reached Vũng Tàu on 23 November, and sailed a day later with miscellaneous Australian equipment aboard. During the return voyage, &quot;Sydney&quot; encountered the disabled merchant ship &quot;Kaiwing&quot;, and towed her to Hong Kong for repairs, arriving on 30 November.

During her voyages to South Vietnam, &quot;Sydney&quot; transported 16,902 soldiers, 5,753 deadweight tons of cargo, 2,375 vehicles, and 14 aircraft. Initially, personnel from &quot;Sydney&quot;, the other transport ships, and their escorts, could not claim time served on logistics or escort deployments towards the active service requirements of the Vietnam Medal, the Australian Active Service Medal, or the Returned From Active Service Badge: the Department of Defence had attempted to limit the cost of repatriation benefits by taking the stance that these ships were not eligible as they were not in combat. Following numerous campaigns to change this, the Australian government issued the Returned from Active Service Badge to all these personnel in 1986, and allowed them to receive military service pensions. Further campaigning and legal challenges resulted in the creation of the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal in 1992, which was presented as a campaign medal to personnel who did not meet the requirements for the Vietnam Medal, but were still involved in the conflict. Similar efforts were made to have &quot;Sydney&quot;″s service recognised with a battle honour: according to Nott and Payne, such a battle honour is yet to be awarded as of 2008, although a 2006 Department of Defence press release lists the honour &quot;Vietnam 1965–72&quot; among those awarded to the ship. The battle honour was confirmed in an updated list released in March 2010.

==Final years, decommissioning and fate==
The ship was assigned the pennant number L134 during 1973. At the start of the year, &quot;Sydney&quot; was marked for a potential deployment to Mururoa in support of a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate sent to protest French nuclear testing at the atoll. The former carrier was chosen as she was capable of replenishing smaller vessels, and the RAN&#x27;s dedicated replenishment oiler, , was undergoing refits. The Australian government did not want to send a warship until all other avenues of protest had been exhausted; the length of this delay meant &quot;Supply&quot;″s refit was finished before &quot;Sydney&quot; was deployed, and the oiler was sent instead. &quot;Sydney&quot; visited Singapore in March, returned to Australia, and sailed to New Zealand in April: she participated in training exercises during both visits. The troopship was then involved in a joint warfare exercise in Jervis Bay during May.
On 20 July 1973, the Australian government decided that &quot;Sydney&quot; was to be decommissioned. A refit planned to start late in the year was cancelled, and on 12 November 1973, &quot;Sydney&quot; was paid off and marked for disposal. The ship had sailed since she was first commissioned: as an aircraft carrier, and as a fast troop transport. Several suggestions for disposal were made by various companies and agencies. The Geelong Regional Tourist Authority wanted the ship moored in Corio Bay for use as a maritime museum, convention centre, and floating casino. The Naval History Society of Australia suggested that the island superstructure be removed and located in The Rocks as a maritime museum, while the owners of the Sydney Opera House planned to use the ship as a floating car park. Tenders closed on 7 October 1975, and the ship was sold on 30 October for breaking up as scrap metal to the Dongkuk Steel Mill in Seoul, South Korea, for A$673,516. &quot;Sydney&quot; was towed from her namesake city by a Japanese tugboat on 23 December 1975, leaving at 1300 hours.

&quot;Sydney&quot; had been originally slated for replacement in the 1960s, with rumours circulating that the new ship would either be an amphibious assault ship of the United States , or the British carrier . The assault ship rumour was proven false by the early 1970s, while the acquisition of &quot;Hermes&quot; was still under discussion in the 1980s as a possible replacement for sister ship HMAS &quot;Melbourne&quot;. Following the decommissioning of &quot;Sydney&quot;, the Australian Defence Force did not possess a long-range troop transportation capability until the modified landing ship was commissioned in 1981.

The ship&#x27;s service, along with the previous two ships of the name, is commemorated by a stained-glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel. The carrier&#x27;s chapel and bell were removed and installed at the naval base in 1974, then were relocated to the Australian National Maritime Museum&#x27;s collection in the 1980s. One of &quot;Sydney&quot;″s anchors is displayed at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at .

<text>HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; (FFG 03) was an guided-missile frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The frigate was one of six modified s ordered from 1977 onwards, and the third of four to be constructed in the United States of America. Laid down and launched in 1980, &quot;Sydney&quot; was named for the capital city of New South Wales, and commissioned into the RAN in 1983.

During her operational history, &quot;Sydney&quot; has been involved in Australian responses to the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état and the Bougainville uprising. The frigate was deployed to the Persian Gulf on five occasions in support of United States operations during the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and has completed two round-the-world voyages.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was originally expected to remain in service until 2013, but was retained in service until 2015; ceasing active deployments on 27 February and serving as a moored training ship until her decommissioning on 7 November. The frigate has been replaced in service by a .

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the s. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the acquisition (a derivative of the American ) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates in 1976. A third (&quot;Sydney&quot;) was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth, with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

As designed, the ship had a full load displacement of 3,605 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Starting in February 1989, &quot;Sydney&quot; was modified from the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; FLIGHT II design to FLIGHT III, requiring a lengthening of the helicopter deck for the RAST helicopter recovery system, which increased displacement to 4,100 tons and pushing the overall length to . Propulsion machinery consisted of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provided a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed was , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors were used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . Standard ship&#x27;s company was 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters. &quot;Sydney&quot; was the first ship of her class to carry female sailors and officers, requiring the installation of partitioning to some mess decks.
Original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. As part of the mid-2000s FFG Upgrade Project, an eight-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System was fitted, with a payload of RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow missiles. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets were fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46, then the MU90 Impact following the FFG Upgrade. Up to six machine guns could be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts were installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite included an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters could be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

The last ship of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; Flight II design, &quot;Sydney&quot; was laid down at Todd Pacific Shipyards on 16 January 1980. She was launched on 26 September 1980, and commissioned into the RAN on 29 January 1983. During construction, the ship was identified by the United States Navy hull number FFG-35.

==Operational history==
From commissioning until mid-1984, &quot;Sydney&quot; was attached to the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet as a unit of Destroyer Squadron 9. During this time, the frigate conducted working-up and training exercises.

In May 1987, &quot;Sydney&quot; visited Fiji, and was alongside in Suva when the first of the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état occurred on 14 May. &quot;Sydney&quot; and sister ship , alongside in Lautoka, were instructed to remain off Fiji to aid in any necessary evacuation of Australian citizens; the first component of what became Operation Morris Dance. &quot;Sydney&quot; remained on station until at least 29 May, when a phased withdrawal began.

Following the acquisition of the Vulcan Phalanx close-in weapon system and the Seahawk helicopter, &quot;Sydney&quot; underwent a modification refit to be capable of using these weapons. This refit occurred over 1987 and 1988, and also saw the installation of fin stabilisation systems.
In January 1990, &quot;Sydney&quot;, , and were placed on standby to evacuate civilians from Bougainville Island following the Bougainville uprising. &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Tobruk&quot; stood down in February, and the two ships departed with the submarine on a deployment to Turkey to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove. Following Anzac Day, &quot;Sydney&quot; continued on a round-the-world voyage, which included numerous diplomatic visits to European and American ports, the first visit of a RAN vessel to Sweden, and participation in a United States counter-narcotics operation in the Caribbean. The frigate arrived home in September.

On 3 December 1990, &quot;Sydney&quot; and the arrived in the Persian Gulf to relieve HMA Ships and as part of Operation Damask; the Australian military contribution to the Gulf War. &quot;Sydney&quot; was assigned to the escort screen around Battle Force Zulu (Task Force 154), a naval force built around four United States Navy aircraft carriers, and also participated in surveillance and boarding operations. The two Australian warships remained in the area until 26 March 1991. &quot;Sydney&quot; was awarded the Meritorious Unit Citation on 4 November 1991 for this deployment, and later received the battle honour &quot;Kuwait 1991&quot;.
&quot;Sydney&quot; was deployed back to the Persian Gulf for Operation Damask from September 1991 to February 1992, and again from June 1993 to December 1993.

On 14 March 1994, &quot;Sydney&quot; rescued the crew of a yacht which had been participating in the Trans-Tasman Yacht Race before encountering difficulties. In early October, the frigate was called on to search for survivors of a light aircraft that ditched into the Tasman Sea.

In May 1995, &quot;Sydney&quot; became the first RAN warship to visit the Russian port of Vladivostok, as support for a diplomatic and trade mission.

In 1997, &quot;Sydney&quot; was one of several RAN vessels placed on standby following the outbreak of political disturbances in Papua New Guinea as part of the Sandline affair. No action was required by the Australian warships.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was deployed to East Timor as part of the Australian-led INTERFET peacekeeping taskforce from 3 November to 19 December 1999. She received the battle honour &quot;East Timor 1999&quot; for this deployment.

On 1 October 2000, &quot;Sydney&quot; took over from sister ship as the RAN vessel assigned to support the peace negotiation process in the Solomon Islands that resulted in the signing of the Townsville Peace Agreement.

In October 2001, &quot;Sydney&quot; returned to the Persian Gulf to operate in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as part of the War in Afghanistan. The frigate was joined by sister ship and the amphibious warfare vessel in early December, and returned to Australia in March 2002. &quot;Sydney&quot; was sent back to the Gulf in support of 2003 invasion of Iraq, operating from May to August 1993 as part of Operations Falconer and Catalyst. The battle honours &quot;Persian Gulf 2001–03&quot; and &quot;Iraq 2003&quot; recognise these deployments.

&quot;Sydney&quot; was the first of four frigates selected to go under the A$1 billion FFG Upgrade, with HMA Ships &quot;Darwin&quot;, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and &quot;Newcastle&quot; following. The upgrade features an 8-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) for 32 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), upgrades to fire control and air warning radars, and replacement of the hull-mounted sonar and diesel generators. This refit commenced in 2002, but problems with integrating the frigates&#x27; anti-missile and anti-torpedo detection and defence systems meant that when &quot;Sydney&quot; was finished in 2007, she was initially not accepted back into service. By November 2008, the problems with the upgrade had been solved.

On the morning of 13 March 2009, &quot;Sydney&quot; was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. The frigate led the line of thirteen ships involved in the ceremonial entry through Sydney Heads, and anchored in the harbour for the review.

On 20 April 2009, &quot;Sydney&quot; and the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigate departed from Sydney as part of Operation Northern Trident, a six-month round-the-world voyage by the two vessels, with numerous diplomatic visits and joint exercises with foreign navies. On 17 May, &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Ballarat&quot; provided aid to two merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, driving off two separate groups of Somali pirates attacking the ships. &quot;Sydney&quot; remained in the area to report the incidents to Combined Task Force 151, while &quot;Ballarat&quot; escorted an impromptu convoy of eight ships, including the two that were attacked, to safety. The two warships visited ports in Western Europe, North America, the Pacific and northern Asia, with &quot;Sydney&quot; arriving back in her namesake city on 19 September.

In May 2013, &quot;Sydney&quot; began a three-month deployment with the United States Seventh Fleet, attached to Carrier Strike Group Five as an escort for the carrier .

In October 2013, &quot;Sydney&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney.

&quot;Sydney&quot; visited Hobart in February 2015 for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the weekend of 7–8 February, the frigate was anchored in the River Derwent to free up wharf space for a civilian vessel. On attempting to return to Macquarie Wharf, the anchor chain broke, leaving the anchor below. The anchor was later recovered by divers. The loss of the anchor prevented &quot;Sydney&quot; from fulfilling duties as the regatta flagship, as the ship would be unable to maintain a stationary position during the event.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Sydney&quot; sailed into her namesake city for the final time on 27 February 2015. Despite flying a decommissioning pennant, the ship was not paid off until 7 November 2015; two years later than originally expected. In the interim, she was moored at Fleet Base East as an alongside training ship.

On 6 November, the day prior to paying off, a parade of 350 current and former personnel from the ship marched in Sydney. At the time of decommissioning, &quot;Sydney&quot; had travelled . She will be replaced by one of the three s.

In April 2016, the Navy offered &quot;Sydney&quot; for use as a dive wreck to Australia&#x27;s states and territories, in the same manner as her sisters and . However, the decision to utilise the ship in this way has been condemned by different organisations, with calls for it to be restored as a memorial to the modern RAN. No organisations expressed interest in using the ship as a dive wreck, and in May 2017 &quot;Sydney&quot; departed under tow for Western Australia where she was to be scrapped.

In May 2017, the &quot;Sydney&quot; was towed to Henderson, Western Australia to be scrapped. A former Todd Shipyards employee informed the company doing the scrapping, Birdon, that a miniature of MacNoughton Canadian Whisky &quot;wrapped in insulation tape, was apparently hidden inside the forward starboard leg of the main mast of HMAS Sydney by the team that built her at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle in 1982. The date, 10 April 1982 was also scribbled on the label.&quot; The bottle was retrieved from its hiding place of 35 years.

<text>Drunken chicken () is a way of preparing chicken using alcoholic beverages. Different varieties of the dish exist in Chinese, Taiwanese, Malaysian, Singaporean cuisine.

== Varieties ==
There are many different ways of cooking drunken chicken.

One with Shaoxing wine originated in the Zhejiang province of eastern China. Shaoxing drunk chicken is cooked and marinated in historic Shaoxing wine to create a deep taste. In another version of the dish, the whole chicken is first steamed then chopped up into pieces appropriately sized for picking up by chopsticks. The steamed meat, along with its juice, is cooked with scallions, ginger and salt. After the chicken is cooked it is marinated in liquor, sherry or a distilled liquor, like whiskey, overnight in the refrigerator. The chicken is served chilled, often as an appetizer. Besides the liquor-flavored meat, another feature of the dish is the liquor-flavored gelatin that results from the chilled mixture of the alcohol and the cooking juices.

<text>State police, provincial police or regional police are a type of sub-national territorial police force found in nations organized as federations, typically in North America, South Asia, and Oceania. These forces typically have jurisdiction over the relevant sub-national jurisdiction, and may cooperate in law enforcement activities with municipal or national police where either exist.

==Argentina==
In Argentina, as a federal country, each province has its own independent police force and its responsible of its funding, training and equipment. State police agencies are responsible of all the territory of a determinate state. There is almost no municipal/local law enforcement in Argentina, and if there is, they are generally limited to traffic duties.

==Australia==

Prior to the Federation of Australia, each colony within Australia had numerous police forces, but these were largely amalgamated well before federation.

Today each state of Australia, as well as the Northern Territory, has its own state police force. Municipalities do not have police forces and it is left to the state forces to police all geographic areas within their respective states. Australia does have a national police force, the Australian Federal Police, whose role is to enforce the laws of the Commonwealth, both criminal law and civil law, as well as to protect the interests of the Commonwealth, both domestically and internationally. The AFP does, however, provide policing for the Australian Capital Territory, Jervis Bay Territory, and Australia&#x27;s other external territories such as Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. 

The state and territory police forces are:
* New South Wales Police Force
* Northern Territory Police
* Queensland Police Service
* South Australia Police
* Tasmania Police
* Victoria Police
* Western Australia Police

==Brazil==

Each federative unit in Brazil, beside its military firefighters corps and its penal and scientific polices, has two main police corporations working together with different skills:

:&quot;Civil Police&quot; — The nonuniformed judiciary police, mainly responsible for investigating criminal offenses occurring in their territories. They&#x27;re mainly based on Delegates (necessarily bachelors of laws), Clerks, Investigators and/or Agents and also responds for its Scientific Polices (responsible for forensic science activities and services) in the Federal District and other 8 states.
:&quot;Military Police&quot; — The uniformed and militarily hierarchical police officers perform, under a gendarmerie system, police functions of patrolling, approaching and capturing, also serving as reserve branches of the Brazilian Armed Forces (more specifically its Brazilian Army). They make up the majority of the police force in Brazil, but don&#x27;t perform regular military police functions (as they&#x27;re reservedly performed by Brazilian Army Police Offices on duty, such as the Army Police (Brazil)) because they&#x27;re primarily subordinated to its governors. In São Paulo, the Military Police also operates its Military Firefighters Corps. In Rio Grande do Sul, in turn, such office is called Military Brigade (&quot;Brigada Militar&quot;) instead of Military Police partially due to the long period for which also responded for its Military Firefighters Corps (which separated from &quot;BMRS&quot; in 2013).

==Canada==

Law enforcement in Canada operates at the federal, provincial, and local levels. Three provinces of Canada have a dedicated police force, with jurisdiction over some or all of the province:
* Ontario Provincial Police (Ontario)
* Royal Newfoundland Constabulary (Newfoundland and Labrador)
* Sûreté du Québec (Quebec)
* Organized Crime Agency of British Columbia (British Columbia)
* Saskatchewan Marshalls Service (Saskatchewan)
The federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) provides provincial-level policing in the remaining land area of Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the remaining seven provinces and three territories. The RCMP began being contracted to provide provincial policing in the late 1920s as provincial police forces were disbanded and their duties contracted out to provincial divisions of the RCMP. The most recent provincial police force to be disbanded, the British Columbia Provincial Police, existed from the mid-19th century until its jurisdiction was transferred to RCMP &quot;E&quot; Division on August 15, 1950.

Provinces which have disbanded their provincial police may retain other provincial law enforcement agencies, such as sheriff services or conservation officers. For example, the Alberta Sheriffs Branch is responsible for traffic enforcement in Alberta together with the RCMP, despite being a law enforcement agency and not a police force.

==Germany==

The &quot;Landespolizei&quot; (or LaPo) is a term used in the Federal Republic of Germany to denote the law enforcement services that perform law enforcement duties in the states of Germany. The German federal constitution leaves the majority of law enforcement responsibilities to the 16 states of the country.

*Bavarian State Police
*Berlin Police
*Brandenburg Police
*Bremen Police

==India==
The Constitution of India delineates the roles and responsibilities of both the central and state governments, with matters related to police, public order, and law and order falling under the purview of the state governments. India has 28 state police agencies.

Each state has a state police force and its own distinct state police services, headed by the director general of police (DGP) or commissioner of police (in metropolitan areas), who is an Indian Police Service officer. The state police forces operate under the authority of the respective state governments and are empowered to enforce laws, prevent crime, investigate offenses, and maintain public order. 

Most municipal or city police forces operate under their respective state police departments, with the exception of the Kolkata Police. State police agencies typically have jurisdiction across the entire state. However, in West Bengal, the jurisdiction of the state police excludes Kolkata, which is served by the Kolkata Police. 

The police forces of union territories in India are either directly or indirectly under the purview of the union government. Unlike state police forces, the Delhi Police operate under the direct control of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, government of India due to Delhi&#x27;s status as both the national capital territory and a union territory. While they function under the respective union territory administrations for day-to-day operations and governance, their ultimate authority and oversight lie with the central government.

The Indian Police Service (IPS) is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers of all states belong regardless of the agency for whom they work. The IPS officers provide senior level leadership to law enforcement agencies, both at the state and federal levels.

==Mexico==

Each of the 32 states of Mexico maintains a separate law enforcement agency or &quot;Policía Estatal&quot;. Each of these state forces is tasked with the protection of their citizens, keeping local order and combating insecurity and drug trafficking. Certain states including Veracruz and Nuevo León have a new model of police force designated as &quot;civilian forces&quot; .

==Spain==
In Spain there are autonomous police forces in four of its nineteen autonomous communities. 

* Ertzainas in the Basque Country
* Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra in Catalonia
* Policía Foral in Navarre 
* Policía Canaria in the Canary Islands
Apart from this, some autonomous communities (Andalusia, Aragon, Asturias, Galicia and Valencian Community) have a special division part of the National Police Corps and autonomous government of each community.

==United States==

In the United States, state police (also termed highway patrol, state patrol, or state highway patrol), or &quot;state troopers&quot;, are a police body unique to 49 of the U.S. states, having statewide authority to conduct law enforcement activities and criminal investigations. Hawaii, despite a widely dispersed archipelago and having four separate county-based police agencies, still has its own statewide policing agency.

In general, these police agencies perform functions outside the jurisdiction of the county sheriff, such as enforcing traffic laws on state highways and interstate expressways, overseeing the security of the state capitol complex, protecting the governor, training new officers for local police forces too small to operate an academy, providing technological and scientific services, supporting local police and helping to coordinate multi-jurisdictional task force activity in serious or complicated cases in those states that grant full police powers statewide. A general trend has been to bring all of these agencies under a state department of public safety. Additionally, they may serve under different state departments such as the highway patrol under the state department of transportation and the marine patrol under the state department of natural resources.

Twenty-three U.S. states use the term &quot;state police&quot;, fifteen use the term &quot;highway patrol&quot;, seven use the term &quot;state patrol&quot;, and three use the term &quot;state highway patrol&quot;, while Alaska&#x27;s agency is the &quot;Division of Alaska State Troopers&quot;. The term &quot;highway patrol&quot; tends to be more common in the southeast and mountain west states. Hawaii is the only state with a Sheriff Division of the Hawaii Department of Law Enforcement with statewide jurisdiction.

<doc id="964241" wikidata="Q2241436" url="?curid=964241" title="Uraidla, South Australia">
<text>Uraidla (, ) is a small town in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia, Australia. At the , Uraidla had a population of 575. However it also sits at the centre of a larger population catchment of rural townships which include Summertown, Piccadilly, Ashton, Basket Range, Carey Gully, Norton Summit and Cherryville.

The name is derived from the Kaurna name Yuridla, which means &quot;two ears&quot; and originally referred to the two nearby peaks of Mt Lofty and Mt Bonython, and also relates to the Dreaming story of Ngarnu, a giant from the east.

==History==
Once the home of the Peramangk Aboriginal people, European settlement commenced in the mid nineteenth century, a primary school opened in 1871 and the town was formally established in the 1880s. A tiny red brick building in the main street bears a plaque declaring that it was the local branch of the Scottish and Welsh Bank. The original courthouse (now a cottage) still stands on the corner of Swamp Road and Greenhill Road. The original general store still exists as a two-storey house near the junction of Days Road and Greenhill Road. The mainstreet of Uraidla was originally planted with a double avenue of European Elms. Only four of these remain.

==Etymology==
The name Uraidla is derived from local Aboriginal origins. The neighbouring Kaurna people (from the Adelaide plains) and a local subgroup known as Peramangk, had a tale about an ancestral giant who fell in battle and whose body formed part of the Mount Lofty Ranges, with his ears forming Mount Lofty and Mount Bonython. The name &quot;Yurrēidla&quot; thus derives from the Kaurna words &quot;yurre&quot; (ear) and the suffix denoting location, &quot;-illa&quot; (Teichelmann &amp; Schurmann 1840). This was later corrupted to Uraidla and adopted as the name of the town.

==Industries==
Uraidla and the surrounding area is an agricultural district with vegetable market gardens on large scale producing leek, cabbage and lettuce, with apple and cherry orchards, along with vineyards producing many local wine vintages. Local wineries that are part of the Adelaide Hills wine district include Parish Hills Wines and Barratt Wines.

The Uraidla Hotel had been closed for several years from 2013, but was refurbished in 2016 as a store. A converted church across from the hotel dubbed &#x27;Lost in a Forest&#x27; provides local wines and wood oven pizzas, whilst the name of a former local restaurant &#x27;The Aristologist&#x27; has been resurrected n the form of a Tapas Bar in nearby Summertown.

The central oval and showgrounds are used annually for the historic Uraidla and Summertown Show, drawing many hundreds of people, traditionally in mid-February; shifted in 2017 to early November. Uraidla is also traditionally a centre for sport with Australian rules football, Netball, Tennis and Lawn Bowls the main sports. The Football Club Rooms and Bowling Club both have licensed premises.

Uraidla and nearby Summertown and Carey Gully are serviced by a mixed business General Store and Post Office and a Village Pharmacy and Health Spa, Hairdresser, Civil Engineering and the Uraidla Family Practice. Private massage therapists, chiropractors, artists and craftspeople, a metal foundry, a salvage warehouse and a freestone quarry also operate in the town or immediate area.

The former Returned Servicemen&#x27;s League Hall in the main street is now being used by the Country Fire Service as the hub for the several local fire crews of Ashton, Summertown, Carey Gully and Piccadilly. During Emergency Fire Events, this site is used for strategic coordination, media interaction, broadcast by television crews and the adjacent Oval is used by helicopters as a landing site.

<text>Mačva (, ; ) is a geographical and historical region in the northwest of Central Serbia, on a fertile plain between the Sava and Drina rivers. The chief town is Šabac. The modern Mačva District of Serbia is named after the region, although the region of Mačva includes only the northern part of this district. A small northern part of Mačva region is in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, in the Syrmia District.

==Name==

The region is named after a town of Mačva, which existed in the Medieval Ages near the river Sava. In the past, the region was also known as &quot;Lower Srem&quot;, while the neighbouring region on the northern bank of the river Sava (present-day Srem) was known as &quot;Upper Srem&quot;.

In Serbian Cyrillic, the region is known as Мачва, in Serbian Latin, Bosnian and Croatian as &quot;Mačva&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Macsó&quot; or &quot;Macsóság&quot;, in Turkish as &quot;Maçva&quot;, and in German as &quot;Matschva&quot;.

==History==
Throughout history, the region of Mačva has successively been a part of the Roman Empire (1st-4th century); the Byzantine Empire (4th-5th century; 5th-7th century; and 11th-12th century), the Hun Empire (5th century), Avar Khaganate (7th century), the Slavic-controlled territories (7th-9th century), the Bulgarian Empire (9th-11th century), the Kingdom of Hungary (12th-13th century; 14th century; 15th century; 16th century), the State of Serb king Stefan Dragutin (13th-14th century), the Serbian Empire (14th century), the State of Nikola Altomanović (14th century), the Moravian Serbia (14th century), the Serbian Despotate (15th century), the Ottoman Empire (15th century; 16th-18th century; 18th-19th century), the Kingdom of Serbia under the Habsburg Monarchy (1718–1739), Karađorđe&#x27;s Serbia (1804–1813), the vassal Principality of Serbia (1815–1878), the independent Principality of Serbia (1878–1882), the Kingdom of Serbia (1882–1918), the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (1918–1929), the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1929–1941), the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia (1941–1944), the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1944–1992), the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1992–2003), and Serbia and Montenegro (2003–2006). Since 2006, the region is part of an independent Serbia.

Mačva was inhabited since the Stone Age. Before the Roman conquest, the region was inhabited by Illyrians and Celtic Scordisces. In the first century BC, the region was conquered by the Romans, and Scordisces were pushed to the northern side of the Sava river. During the Roman rule, the region was part of the provinces of Moesia and Pannonia.

Roman rule lasted until the 5th century, and the region was conquered by the Sarmatians, Huns, Goths, Gepids, Lombards and Avars. In the 6th century, Slavic tribes settled in the region.

The region was then included into Byzantine Empire, Frankish Kingdom, and Bulgarian Empire. In the 11th century, the Byzantine province known as the Theme of Sirmium included both, the present-day region of Srem and Mačva, thus Srem became the designation for both regions.

In the 13th century, the region was included into the Kingdom of Hungary and Banovina of Mačva was formed in 1247. Banovina was named after a town called Mačva, but the location of this settlement has not been clearly established in modern times. It is suspected that the town of Mačva existed a few kilometers down the river from modern Šabac.

During the Hungarian administration the region was ruled by several powerful bans. Hungarian king Béla IV granted authority over Mačva to Rostislav Mikhailovich, a refugee Russian prince. In the 13th century, Béla of Macsó (grandson of Béla IV) ruled Mačva as well as Usora and Soli (areas across Drina river in today&#x27;s northeastern Bosnia).

Between 1282 and 1316 the Serb King Stefan Dragutin ruled the &quot;Kingdom of Srem&quot;, which consisted of Mačva, Usora, Soli and some adjacent territories. His capital cities were Debrc (between Belgrade and Šabac) and Belgrade. In that time the name &quot;Srem&quot; was designation for two territories: &quot;Upper Srem&quot; (present day Srem) and &quot;Lower Srem&quot; (present day Mačva). Kingdom of Srem under the rule of Stefan Dragutin was located in Lower Srem. According to some sources, Stefan Dragutin also ruled over Upper Srem, but other sources are mentioning another local ruler, Ugrin Csák, who ruled over Upper Srem and Slavonija.

At first, Stefan Dragutin was a vassal of the Hungarian king, but since the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, both, Stefan Dragutin and Ugrin Csák were de facto independent rulers. Stephen Dragutin died in 1316, and was succeeded by his son, King Vladislaus II (1316–1324). Vladislaus II was defeated by the king of Serbia, Stefan Dečanski, in 1324, and after this, Mačva became a subject of dispute between the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the 14th century, the bans of the Garay family (Paul Garay, Nicholas I Garay and his son Nicholas II Garay) which were under the Hungarian suzerainty expanded their rule not only to Bosnia but to Srem and the last one also became the ban of Slavonia and Croatia, which was also part of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time. Mačva was part of the Serbian Empire of Stefan Dušan and part of the state of the Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanović.

In the 15th century, Mačva was part of Serbian Despotate, and since 1459, it was part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 16th-17th century, Mačva was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Zvornik, which was part of the Pashaluk of Bosnia. It was under Ottoman administration until 1718, when it was captured by the Habsburgs. Between 1718 and 1739, Mačva was part of the Habsburg-administered Kingdom of Serbia, and since 1739, it was again part of the Ottoman Empire. In this time, the region was part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Smederevo. In 1788, the &quot;Mačvanska knežina&quot; (&quot;Princedom of Mačva&quot; - a local administrative unit) had 25 villages with 845 houses. The name of the local administrator (&quot;oberknez&quot;) was Uroš Drmanović. Between 1804 and 1815, Mačva was part of Serbia ruled by Karađorđe. Since 1817, it was part of the autonomous Principality of Serbia, and since 1882, part of the Kingdom of Serbia.

During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian army occupied the region and committed war crimes against innocent Serb civilians in Mačva and Podrinje. Beginning in 1918, the region was part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). Between 1918 and 1922 the region was part of Podrinjski okrug, between 1922 and 1929 part of Podrinjska oblast, while between 1929 and 1941 it was part of Drina Banovina. Between 1941 and 1944, Mačva was part of the area governed by the Military Administration in Serbia, and since 1945, it has been part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia and new socialist Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia and Yugoslav wars, Mačva became part of an independent Serbia.

<text>The Polish Underground State (, also known as the Polish Secret State) was a single political and military entity formed by the union of resistance organizations in occupied Poland that were loyal to the Government of the Republic of Poland in exile in London. The first elements of the Underground State were established in the final days of the German and Soviet invasion of Poland, in late September 1939. The Underground State was perceived by supporters as a legal continuation of the pre-war Republic of Poland (and its institutions) that waged an armed struggle against the country&#x27;s occupying powers: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Underground State encompassed not only military resistance, one of the largest in the world, but also civilian structures, such as justice, education, culture and social services.

Although the Underground State enjoyed broad support throughout much of the war, it was not supported or recognized by the communists and some of the right-wing extremists. The influence of the communists eventually declined amid military reversals (most notably, the failure of the Warsaw Uprising) and the growing hostility of the USSR. The Soviet Union had created an alternative, puppet government in 1944 (the Polish Committee of National Liberation) and ensured it formed the basis of the post-war government in Poland. During the Soviet-backed communist takeover of Poland at the end of the war, many Underground State members were prosecuted as alleged traitors and died in captivity. Abandoned by the Western Allies, finding it impossible to negotiate with the Soviets, and wishing to avoid a civil war, the key institutions of the Underground State dissolved themselves in the first half of 1945.

Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of people were directly involved with various agencies of the Underground State (the estimates for membership in Armia Krajowa alone are often given at approaching half a million people), and they were quietly supported by millions of Polish citizens. The rationale behind the creation of the secret civilian authority drew on the fact that the German and Soviet occupation of Poland was illegal. Hence, all institutions created by the occupying powers were considered illegal, and parallel Polish underground institutions were set up in accordance with Polish law. The scale of the Underground State was also inadvertently aided by the actions of the occupiers, whose attempts to destroy the Polish state, nation, and its culture, including most importantly genocidal policies that targeted Polish citizens, fuelled popular support for the Polish resistance movement and its development.

During the Cold War era, research on the Underground State was curtailed by Polish communist officials, who instead emphasized the role that communist partisans played in the anti-Nazi resistance. Hence, until recently, the bulk of research done on this topic was carried out by Polish scholars living in exile.

==History==

===1939–1940: Formation===
In many respects, the history of the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist resistance in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland&#x27;s Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw, at a time when the Polish defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from Polish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century Polish National Government and World War I-era Polish Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the Polish Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.

Following the Polish Constitution, President Ignacy Mościcki, interned in Romania after the Polish government evacuated itself from Poland on 17 September, resigned and appointed General Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski as his successor; unpopular with the French government, Wieniawa-Długoszowski was replaced by Władysław Raczkiewicz on 29 September. General Władysław Sikorski, a long-term opponent of the Sanacja regime who resided in France and had the support of the French government, would become the Polish Commander-in-Chief (on 28 September) and Poland&#x27;s Prime Minister (on 30 September). This government was quickly recognized by France and the United Kingdom. Raczkiewicz, described as &quot;weak and indecisive&quot;, held relatively little influence compared to charismatic Sikorski.

Due to political differences among factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP ties to the Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since the mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported the formation of the Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.
Given that the ZWZ focused on military aspects of the struggle, its civilian dimension was less clearly defined and developed more slowly—a situation exacerbated by the complex political discussions that were then unfolding between politicians in occupied Poland and the government in exile (first located in Paris, and after the fall of France, in London). Sikorski&#x27;s government opted for a much more democratic procedure then the less democratic prewar Sanacja regime. The National Council (Rada Narodowa) was formed by the government in exile in December 1939, including representatives from different Polish political factions. Meanwhile, in occupied Poland, a major step toward the development of the organization&#x27;s civilian structure was taken in late February 1940, when the ZWZ established its local version of the National Council, the Political Consultative Committee (Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy, PKP). PKP was formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the Socialist Party, People&#x27;s Party, National Party and Labor Party. In 1943 it was renamed to Home Political Representation (&quot;Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna&quot;) and in 1944 to Council of National Unity (&quot;Rada Jedności Narodowej&quot;).

The structures in occupied Poland maintained close communication with the government in exile, through radio communications and &quot;hundreds, if not thousands&quot; of couriers, such as Jan Karski. One of the most significant developments of 1940 was the creation of the office of Government Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Rządu na Kraj), with Cyryl Ratajski (nominated on 3 December) as the first Delegate; this event marked the official beginning of the Underground State (Ratajski would be followed by Jan Piekałkiewicz, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and Stefan Korboński). The post of the Delegate could be seen as equivalent to that of a Deputy Prime Minister (particularly since the legislation of 1944). Unlike the GRP and PKP, which operated alongside the military structures but had no influence over them, the Delegation had budgetary control over the military. The Delegation was to oversee the military and recreate the civilian administration.

As early as 1940, the Underground State&#x27;s civilian arm was actively supporting underground education; it then set out to develop social security, information (propaganda) and justice networks.

===1941–1943: Growth===
By 1942, most of the differences between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State&#x27;s parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.
In August 1943 and March 1944, the Polish Underground State announced its long-term plan, which was partly designed to undercut the attractiveness of some of the communists&#x27; proposals. The communists, in their increasingly radical &quot;What We Fight For&quot; declarations (from March and November 1943), were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even communist state, denouncing capitalism, which they equated to slavery. They demanded nationalization of most if not all of the economy, introduction of central planning, The Underground State&#x27;s declaration &quot;What the Polish Nation is Fighting For&quot; declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal, guaranteeing full equality to the minorities, as well as full freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of political activity. The plan also called for the creation of a Central European federal union, without domination by any single state. In the economic sector, planned economy would be endorsed, by embracing the socialist and Christian Democrat principles, such as income redistribution, aiming at a reduction of economic inequality. The plan promised land reform, nationalization of the industrial base, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the country&#x27;s pre-1939 eastern border. According to the plan, the country&#x27;s Eastern borders, as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga, would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from German territories. Thus, the main differences between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms, which both sides advocated, but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations. The program was criticized by the nationalist factions, for being too socialist, and not &quot;Christian&quot; enough.

The Underground State achieved its zenith of influence in early 1944. In April, the Polish government in exile recognized the administrative structure of the Delegate&#x27;s Office as the Temporary Governmental Administration. This was when the Delegate officially became recognized as the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers at Home (Krajowa Rada Ministrów, KRM) was created. The Underground State however declined sharply in the aftermath of the nationwide uprising, Operation Tempest, initiated in the spring of 1944. In addition to the costly and eventually unsuccessful Warsaw Uprising part of the Operation Tempest, the hostile attitude of the Soviet Union and its puppet Polish government, the Polish Committee of National Liberation (Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego, PKWN) towards the non-communist resistance loyal to the Polish government in exile proved to be disastrous. The Underground State assumed that the Polish resistance would aid the advancing Soviet forces, and AK commanders and representatives of the administrative authority would assume the role of legitimate hosts. Instead, the Soviets commonly surrounded, disarmed and arrested the Underground&#x27;s military authority members and its civilian representatives, instituting their own administrative structures instead. In early July 1944, even as the AK resistance continued its struggle against the Germans, the Underground State was forced to order the AK and its administrative structure to remain in hiding from the Soviets, due to continued arrests and reprisals experienced by those who revealed themselves.

===1944–1945: Decline and dissolution===
Events taking place in 1943 significantly weakened the Polish government in exile. A rift developed between Poland and the Soviet Union, an increasingly important ally for the West, particularly after the revelation of the Katyn massacre in 1943 (on 13 April), followed by the breaking-off of diplomatic relations with Poland by the Soviets (on 21 April). The subsequent death (on 4 July) of the charismatic General Sikorski, succeeded by less influential Stanisław Mikołajczyk as the Prime Minister, and General Sosnkowski as the Commander-in-Chief, contributed to the decline. No representative of the Polish government was invited to the Tehran Conference (28 November – 1 December 1943) or the Yalta Conference (4–11 February 1945), the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviet Union discussed the shape of the post-war world and decided on the fate of Poland, assigning it to the Soviet sphere of influence. In Tehran, neither Churchill nor Roosevelt objected to Stalin&#x27;s suggestion that the Polish government in exile in London was not representing Polish interests; as historian Anita Prażmowska noted, &quot;this spelled the end of that government&#x27;s tenuous influence and raison d&#x27;être.&quot; After the Tehran Conference, Stalin decided to create his own puppet government for Poland, and the PKWN was proclaimed in 1944. PKWN was recognized by the Soviet Government as the only legitimate authority in Poland, while Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Government in London, was termed by the Soviets an &quot;illegal and self-styled authority.&quot; Mikołajczyk would serve in the Prime Minister&#x27;s role until 24 November 1944, when, realizing the increasing powerlessness of the government in exile, he resigned and was succeeded by Tomasz Arciszewski, &quot;whose obscurity&quot;, in the words of historian Mieczysław B. Biskupski, &quot;signaled the arrival of the government in exile at total inconsequentiality.&quot;
The communists refused to deal with the Underground State just like they refused to deal with the government in exile; its leaders and soldiers in &quot;liberated&quot; Polish territories were persecuted. A number of prominent leaders of the Underground State, including the Government Delegate, Jan Stanisław Jankowski and the last AK Commander-in-Chief, General Leopold Okulicki, who decided to reveal themselves and upon the Soviet invitation begun open negotiations with the communist authorities, were arrested and sentenced by the Soviets in Moscow in the infamous Trial of the Sixteen (arrests were carried out in March 1945, and the trial itself took place in June that year). On 27 June 1945 the Council of National Unity held its last session, issuing a 12-point declaration demanding that the Soviet army leave Poland and the repression of the non-communist political parties cease. The Government Delegate&#x27;s Office at Home, restructured after the arrests of its leadership and headed by the last Delegate, Stefan Korboński, disbanded on 1 July, after the creation in Moscow of the Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej, TRJN) on 28 June 1945. The disbanding of those structures marked the end of the Underground State.

The TRJN was composed primarily of communist representatives from the PKWN, with a token representation of the opposition as a gesture towards the Western Allies. With the establishment of the TRJN, the government in exile stopped being recognized by the Western Allies (France withdrew its recognition on 29 June, followed by United Kingdom and the United States on 5 July), who decided to support the Soviet-backed and increasingly communist TRJN body. Seeing this as a &quot;Western betrayal&quot;, the government in exile protested that decision and continued to operate till the fall of communism in 1989, when it recognized the post-communist Polish government. Following the rigged Polish legislative election of 1947, the few independent politicians like Mikołajczyk who attempted to form an opposition were threatened with arrests, retired or emigrated.

The Underground State&#x27;s military arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 to avoid armed conflict with the Soviets and civil war. Over the next few years the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and surrender to the communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.

==Political representation==
The Underground State represented most, though not all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political Consultative Committee (PKP) represented four major Polish parties: the Socialist Party (PPS-WRN), the People&#x27;s Party (SL), the SN, and the Labor Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, four months after the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;, were also represented in the Home Political Representation (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. For example, the nationalists from the National Radical Camp Falanga formed the Confederation of the Nation, which included most members of the pre-war far-right, partially merging with the ZWZ around 1941 and finally joining the AK around fall 1943. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were.

The most important groups that refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State included the communists (Polish Workers Party (PPR) and its military arm, the People&#x27;s Guard, later transformed into the People&#x27;s Army), and the far-right extremists from the National Radical Camp ABC (Group Szaniec and its military arm, the Military Organization Lizard Union). Both the extreme left (the communists) and the extreme right (the nationalists) did not recognize the Underground State and in some cases actively persecuted people connected with it. Only the PPR, however, opposed to Polish independence and supporting full inclusion of Poland in the Soviet Union, was seen as completely outside the framework of the State; the other groups were seen as a justifiable opposition. In 1944 PPR would become part of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a Soviet puppet government.

==Structure==

===Civilian===
The government in exile, located first in France and later in the United Kingdom, with the President, Prime Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army was the top military and civilian authority, recognized by the authorities of the Underground State as their commanders. The government in exile was represented in the occupied Poland by the Government Delegation for Poland, headed by the Government Delegate for Poland.

The main role of the civilian branch of the Underground State was to preserve the continuity of the Polish state as a whole, including its institutions. These institutions included the police, the courts, and schools. This branch of the state was intended to prepare cadres and institutions to resume power after the German defeat in World War II. By the final years of the war, the civilian structure of the Underground State included an underground parliament, administration, judiciary (courts and police), secondary and higher-level education, and supported various cultural activities such as the publishing of newspapers and books, underground theatres, lectures, exhibitions, concerts and safeguarded various works of art. It also dealt with providing social services, including to the destitute Jewish population (through the council to Aid Jews, or Żegota). Through the Directorate of Civil Resistance (1941–1943) the civil arm was also involved in lesser acts of resistance, such as minor sabotage, although in 1943 this department was merged with the Directorate of Covert Resistance, forming the Directorate of Underground Resistance, subordinate to AK.

The departments can be seen as loosely corresponding to ministries. Three departments were dedicated to war-related issues: the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, the Department for Public Works and Reconstruction, and the Department for Information and the Press; the other departments mirrored pre-war Polish ministries (e.g., Department of Post Offices and Telegraphs, or Department of the Treasury). The Delegate&#x27;s Office was divided into departments, 14 of which existed toward the end of the war; the full list included: the Presidential Department, the Department of Internal Affairs, Justice Department, Employment and Social Welfare Department, Agriculture Department, Treasury Department, Trade and Industry Department, Postal and Telegraph Services Department, the Department for Elimination of the Consequences of War, Transport Department, Information and the Press, Department of Public Works and Reconstruction, Department of Education and Culture and the Department of National Defence.

On the geographical division level, the Delegation had local offices, dividing Polish territories into 16 voivodeships, each under an underground voivode, further divided into powiats headed by starostas, and with separate municipal bodies. In early 1944, the Delegation employed some 15,000 people in its administration; those were primarily older people, as the younger ones were recruited for the military side of the operations.

===Military===
The military arm of the Polish Underground State consisted primarily of various branches of the Armia Krajowa (AK) and, until 1942, the Union of Armed Struggle. This arm of the state was designed to prepare the Polish society for a future fight for the country&#x27;s liberation. Apart from armed resistance, sabotage, intelligence, training, and propaganda, the state&#x27;s military arm was responsible for maintaining communication with the London-based government in exile, and for protecting the civilian arm of the state.

The Armia Krajowa&#x27;s primary resistance operations were the sabotage of German activities, including transports headed for the Eastern Front in the Soviet Union. The sabotage of German rail and road transports to the Eastern Front was so extensive it is estimated that one-eighth of all German transports to the Eastern Front were destroyed or significantly delayed due to AK&#x27;s activities.

The AK also fought several full-scale battles against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and 1944 during Operation Tempest. They tied down significant German forces, worth at least several divisions (upper estimates suggest about 930,000 troops), diverting much-needed supplies, while trying to support the Soviet military. Polish intelligence operatives supplied valuable intelligence information to the Allies; 43 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939–45 came from Polish sources. At its height, AK numbered over 400,000 and was recognized as one of the three largest, or even the largest, resistance movement of the war. Axis fatalities due to the actions of the Polish underground, of which AK formed the bulk, are estimated at up to 150,000.

==Definition, historiography and remembrance==
For decades, research on the Polish Underground State was restricted, largely because the communist People&#x27;s Republic of Poland did not wish to fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish &quot;émigré&quot; historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe&#x27;s largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (&quot;la Résistance&quot;).

With the fall of communism, Poland regained full independence and Polish scholars could begin unrestricted research into all aspects of Polish history. Scholars who chose to investigate the Underground State were also confronted with the issue of its uniqueness (no country or nation has ever created a similar institution), and hence, the problem of defining it. Polish historian Stanisław Salmonowicz, discussing the historiography of the Polish Underground State, defined it as a &quot;collection of state-legal, organizational and citizenship structures, which were to ensure the constitutional continuation of Polish statehood on its own territory&quot;. Salmonowicz concluded that &quot;This constitutional continuity, real performance of the state&#x27;s functions on its past territory and the loyalty of a great majority of Polish society were the most significant elements of its existence.&quot;

The Underground State also became officially recognized by the Polish government, local authorities and the community, with most major cities in Poland erecting various memorials to the Underground State-affiliated resistance. In Poznań, there is a dedicated Polish Underground State Monument erected in 2007. On 11 September 1998 the Sejm (parliament) of Poland declared the day of 27 September (anniversary of the founding of the Service for Poland&#x27;s Victory organization) to be the Day of the Polish Underground State.

==Notes==
: a The more widely used term &quot;Polish Underground State&quot; was first used on 13 January 1944 by the official underground publication of the Polish underground authorities, the Biuletyn Informacyjny. &quot;Polish Secret State&quot; (Polish: &quot;Tajne państwo&quot;) was a term used by Jan Karski in his book &quot;Story of a Secret State&quot;, written and first published in the second half of 1944 in the United States.

: b Several sources note that the Armia Krajowa was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. For example, Norman Davies wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance&quot;; Gregor Dallas wrote &quot;Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400,000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe&quot;; Mark Wyman wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe&quot;. Certainly, the Polish resistance was the largest resistance movement until the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in 1941; in the last years of the war those two resistances would rival AK in its strength (see Resistance during World War II for a more detailed analysis). Compared to them, the size of the French resistance was smaller, numbering around 10,000 people in 1942, and swelling to 200,000 by 1944.

<text>Cynthia Yih Shih (born October 3, 1978), better known by her stage name Vienna Teng, is an American pianist and singer-songwriter who lives in Washington, DC. Teng has released five studio albums: &quot;Waking Hour&quot; (2002), &quot;Warm Strangers&quot; (2004), &quot;Dreaming Through the Noise&quot; (2006), &quot;Inland Territory&quot; (2009) and &quot;Aims&quot; (2013). She has also released one live album, &quot;The Moment Always Vanishing&quot; (2009), on which she is double-billed with her percussionist, Alex Wong.

Teng&#x27;s musical style incorporates folk, pop, classical piano, and &quot;a cappella&quot;.

==Early life, education, and early career==
A native of Saratoga, California, she began playing classical piano at the age of five. Both her parents came from Taiwan. She was salutatorian at Saratoga High School. In 1996, while pursuing a degree in computer science at Stanford University, Teng joined the Stanford Harmonics, a student-run &quot;a cappella&quot; group.

She began recording her compositions at the studios in Stanford&#x27;s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), intending to distribute her music on campus.
Many of these recordings were eventually released in her début album &quot;Waking Hour&quot;.
After graduating in 2000, Teng worked as a software engineer for Cisco Systems in San Jose, but she continued to write music and perform in her free time.

In 2002, Teng signed with Virt Records and quit Cisco Systems to focus on her musical career. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 2013 with master&#x27;s degrees in science and business administration, she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company full-time in the area of renewable energy.

==Career==
===&quot;Waking Hour&quot; and &quot;Warm Strangers&quot;===
Teng&#x27;s first major national exposure was on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Edition&quot; in January 2003, followed shortly thereafter by CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman.&quot; She has since made appearances on the CBS Saturday &quot;Early Show&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;NewsNight with Aaron Brown&quot; and &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, and opened concerts for Joan Baez, Shawn Colvin, Joan Osborne, India.Arie, Brandi Carlile, Sarah Harmer and Marc Cohn. Although nearly all of Teng&#x27;s recordings are in English, &quot;Warm Strangers&quot; features a hidden cover of &quot;Green Island Serenade&quot;, a 1950s Taiwanese classic performed in Mandarin Chinese.

===&quot;Dreaming Through the Noise&quot;===
In 2006, Teng signed with Zoë/Rounder. From December 2006 to early 2007, Teng toured extensively in the United States to promote the release of her third album, &quot;Dreaming Through the Noise&quot;. Teng co-headlined with Duncan Sheik and opened for Madeleine Peyroux. She began the Green Caravan Tour in April 2007, accompanied by cellist Marika Hughes, violinist Dina Maccabee, and percussionist Alex Wong, along with opening acts such as David Berkeley and Jenny Owen Youngs. She performed a cover version of Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Idioteque&quot; during this time. In 2008, she relocated from California to New York City, and performed in Central Park on Earth Day at the Green Apple Festival.

===&quot;Inland Territory&quot; and study at the University of Michigan===
Her fourth album, &quot;Inland Territory,&quot; was released in 2009. Teng stated that the lyrics to &quot;Grandmother Song&quot; from &quot;Inland Territory&quot; are nearly a verbatim translation of a lecture that Teng received from her Mandarin-speaking grandmother, voicing her disapproval of Teng&#x27;s career choice.

In 2010, Teng announced to her fans that she had been accepted into the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan. Through the program, she received an MBA from the Ross School of Business and an MS from the School of Natural Resources and Environment. During this period, Teng moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where she continued to perform and compose music, although she did not tour as frequently as she had before enrolling. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 2013, she worked at McKinsey &amp; Company full-time in the area of renewable energy.

===&quot;Aims&quot;===
Teng&#x27;s fifth studio album, titled &quot;Aims&quot;, was inspired by Detroit and released in September 2013. From September to December 2013 Teng went on a tour across the United States and Western Europe to promote the new material. During this tour, she performed as a trio with Alex Wong and Jordan Hamlin, two other musicians who appeared on the album. The album was released in a standard edition and in deluxe edition sold through Teng&#x27;s website.

==Personal life==
By 2018, Teng was living in Boulder, Colorado. She currently lives in Washington, DC.

In early 2019, Teng announced her marriage to Jacob Corvidae. Their daughter, Arcadia, was born in February 2020. Additionally, Teng is a step-parent to Corvidae&#x27;s two children from a previous relationship.

<doc id="964266" wikidata="Q737712" url="?curid=964266" title="Asplenia">
<text>Asplenia refers to the absence of normal spleen function and is associated with some serious infection risks. Hyposplenism is used to describe reduced (&#x27;hypo-&#x27;) splenic functioning, but not as severely affected as with asplenism.

Functional&quot; aspleniaoccurs when splenic tissue is present but does not work well (e.g. sickle-cell disease, [[polysplenia]]) such patients are managed as if asplenic while in anatomic&quot; asplenia, the spleen itself is absent.

==Causes==

===Congenital===
* Congenital asplenia is rare. There are two distinct types of genetic disorders: heterotaxy syndrome and isolated congenital asplenia.
* polysplenia

===Acquired===
Acquired asplenia occurs for several reasons:
* Following splenectomy due to splenic rupture from trauma or because of tumor
* After splenectomy with the &quot;goal&quot; of interfering with splenic function, as a treatment for diseases (e.g. idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, thalassemia, spherocytosis), in which the spleen&#x27;s usual activity exacerbates the disease
* After splenectomy with the goal of arresting the progression of cancers (Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin&#x27;s disease (starting in the 1970s), non-Hodgkin lymphoma)
* Due to underlying diseases that destroy the spleen (autosplenectomy), e.g. sickle-cell disease.
* Celiac disease: unknown physiopathology. In a 1970 study, it was the second most common cause of abnormalities of red blood cells linked to hyposplenism, after surgical splenectomy.

== Functional asplenia ==
Functional asplenia can occur when patients with metabolic or haematological disorders have their splenic tissue organisation altered. This can lead to results similar to those seen in patients who have undergone a splenectomy e.g. becoming infected with encapsulated bacteria such as &quot;Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.&quot; Patients who have some form of asplenia have an increased susceptibility to these encapsulated bacterial infections mainly because they lack IgM memory B cells and their non-adherence to polysaccharide vaccines. Furthermore, there is a deficiency of other splenic cells e.g. splenic macrophages. This combined with the lack of B cells can provide an environment favourable for the development of bacterial infections.

==Partial splenectomy and preservation of splenic function==
In an effort to preserve some of the spleen&#x27;s protective roles, attempts are now often made to preserve a small part of the spleen when performing either surgical subtotal (partial) splenectomy, or partial splenic embolization.
This may be particularly important in poorer countries where protective measures for patients with asplenia are not available.
However, it has been advised that preoperative vaccination is advisable until the remnant splenic tissue can reestablish its function.

==Risks==
Asplenia is a form of immunodeficiency, increasing the risk of sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria, and can result in overwhelming post splenectomy infection (OPSI), often fatal within a few hours. In particular, patients are at risk from &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, and meningococcus. The risk is elevated as much as 350–fold.

The increased risk of infection is due to inability to clear opsonised bacteria from circulating blood. There is also a deficiency of T-cell independent antibodies, such as those reactive to the polysaccharide capsule of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;.

The risk to asplenic patients has been expressed as equivalent to an adult dying in a road traffic accident (1 to 5 percent of people without spleens would develop a severe infection per decade) (reference UK Splenectomy Trust Advice)—hence sensible precautions are advisable. Increased platelet counts can be seen in individuals without a functioning spleen.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal ultrasonography and detection of Howell-Jolly bodies in red blood cells.

==Management==
To minimise the risks associated with splenectomy, antibiotic and vaccination protocols have been established, but are often poorly adhered to by physicians and patients due to the complications resulting from antibiotic prophylaxis such as development of an overpopulation of &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; in the intestinal tract.

===Antibiotic prophylaxis===
Because of the increased risk of infection, physicians administer oral antibiotics as prophylaxis after a surgical splenectomy, or starting at birth for congenital or functional asplenia.

Those with asplenia are also cautioned to start a full-dose course of antibiotics at the first onset of an upper or lower respiratory tract infection (for example, sore throat or cough), or at the onset of any fever. Even with a course of antibiotics and even with a history of relevant vaccination, persons without a functional spleen are at risk for Overwhelming post-splenectomy infection.

In an emergency room or hospital setting, appropriate evaluation and treatment for an asplenic febrile patient should include a complete blood count with differential, blood culture with Gram stain, arterial blood gas analysis, chest x-ray, and consideration for lumbar puncture with CSF studies. None of these evaluations should delay the initiation of appropriate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines state that antibiotics should be administered to a patient suspected of sepsis within 1 hour of presentation. Delay in starting antibiotics for any reason is associated with a poor outcome.

===Vaccinations===
It is suggested that splenectomized persons receive the following vaccinations, and ideally prior to planned splenectomy surgery:
* Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (not before 2 years of age). Children may first need one or more boosters of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine if they did not complete the full childhood series.
* Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, especially if not received in childhood. For adults who have not been previously vaccinated, two doses given two months apart was advised in the new 2006 UK vaccination guidelines (in the UK may be given as a combined Hib/MenC vaccine).
* Meningococcal conjugate vaccine, especially if not received in adolescence. Previously vaccinated adults require a single booster and non-immunised adults advised, in UK since 2006, to have two doses given two months apart. Children too young for the conjugate vaccine should receive meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine in the interim.
* Influenza vaccine, every winter, to help prevent getting secondary bacterial infection.

===Travel measures===
In addition to the normal immunizations advised for the countries to be visited, Group A meningococcus should be included if visiting countries of particular risk (e.g. sub-saharan Africa). The non-conjugated Meningitis A and C vaccines usually used for this purpose give only 3 years coverage and provide less-effective long-term cover for Meningitis C than the conjugated form already mentioned.

Those lacking a functional spleen are at higher risk of contracting malaria, and succumbing to its effects. Travel to malarial areas will carry greater risks and is best avoided. Travellers should take the most appropriate anti-malarial prophylaxis medication and be extra vigilant over measures to prevent mosquito bites.

The pneumococcal vaccinations may not cover some of the other strains of pneumococcal bacteria present in other countries. Likewise, their antibiotic resistance may also vary, requiring a different choice of stand-by antibiotic.

===Additional measures===
* &quot;Surgical and dental procedures&quot; - Antibiotic prophylaxis may be required before certain surgical or dental procedures.
* &quot;Animal bites&quot; - adequate antibiotic cover is required after even minor dog or other animal bites. Asplenic patients are particularly susceptible to infection by &quot;Capnocytophaga canimorsus&quot; and should receive a five-day course of amoxicillin/clavulanate (erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin).
* &quot;Tick bites&quot; - &quot;Babesiosis&quot; is a rare tickborne infection. Patients should check themselves or have themselves inspected for tick bites if they are in an at-risk situation. Presentation with fever, fatigue, and haemolytic anaemia requires diagnostic confirmation by identifying the parasites within red blood cells on blood film and by specific serology. Quinine (with or without clindamycin) is usually an effective treatment.
* &quot;Alert warning&quot; - People without a working spleen can carry a card, or wear a special bracelet or necklet which says that they do not have a working spleen. This would alert a healthcare professional to take rapid action if they become seriously ill and cannot notify them of their condition.

<text>A newsagent&#x27;s shop or simply newsagent&#x27;s or paper shop (British English), newsagency (Australian English) or newsstand (American and Canadian English) is a business that sells newspapers, magazines, cigarettes, snacks and often items of local interest. In the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, these businesses are termed &quot;newsagents&quot; (or &quot;newsagency&quot; in Australia). Newsagents typically operate in busy public places like city streets, railway stations and airports. Racks for newspapers and magazines can also be found in convenience stores, bookstores and supermarkets. The physical establishment can be either freestanding or part of a larger structure (e.g. a shopping mall or a railway station).

In Canada and the United States, newsstands are often open stalls in public locations such as streets, or in a transit terminal or station (subway, rail, or airport).

==By country==

===Australia===

A newsagent is the manager of the newspaper department of the shop, often also the owner of a newsagency shop.

Newsagencies conduct either a retail business and/or a distribution business.

When they first appeared in Australia is unknown; the earliest reference known in Australia is an advertisement in 1855 in Melbourne.

The number of newsagencies in Australia are falling in recent years and this decline is expected to continue. In 2000, there was estimated about 5,000, by 2007/8 there were 4,635 newsagencies, and by 2016/7 there were just 3,150 newsagencies.

====Retail newsagencies====
Retail newsagencies primarily offer a comprehensive range of newspapers and magazines, as well as stationery and greeting cards.

====Distribution newsagencies====
Distribution newsagencies offer home delivery of a comprehensive range of newspapers and magazines, These can be quite large and sophisticated businesses. If authorised, they are often fully computerized. They often have a territory, which is partly protected by contracts with most of the Australian Newsagents&#x27; Federation recognised publishers/distributors. These recognised publishers/distributors include ACP Publishing, News Limited, Fairfax Publications, Rural Press, &quot;The West Australian&quot; and Australian Provincial Newspapers. These monopolies have been a major source of contention between newsagents and the Australian Consumer Affairs.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, newsagents&#x27; shops are known as &quot;bancas de jornal&quot; or &quot;bancas de revistas&quot; and are usually family-owned, free-standing kiosks that only deal in periodical publications, telephone cards, bus tickets and the occasional book and cut-price DVD.
In suburban areas and villages they are normally housed in a shop selling stationery, tobacco and sweets as well as periodicals.

===Greece===
In Greece, newsagents&#x27; shops are called periptera (&quot;singular&quot;: periptero) and they sell newspapers and magazines, but also other goods like beverages (including alcoholic ones), snacks, tobacco; and other kinds of merchandise. Opening times vary. They are typically found on the side of the road in crowded public areas.
===Italy===
In Italy, newsagents&#x27; shops are known as edicola and are usually family-owned, free-standing kiosks that only deal in periodical publications, stickers, bus tickets and the occasional book and cut-price DVD.
In suburban areas and villages they are normally housed in a shop selling stationery, tobacco and sweets as well as periodicals.

===Japan===
In Japan, newsagents&#x27; shops are called kiosks, and are typically found in or around railway or subway stations. In addition to newspapers and magazines, they sell beverages, snack foods, postage stamps, cigarettes, and many other kinds of merchandise. Ekiben boxed lunches can be purchased at larger kiosks in inter-city rail stations.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, newsagents&#x27; shops are small shops selling newspapers as well as magazines, sweets and tobacco; some of them also sell provisions and alcoholic beverages. Opening times vary according to the owners&#x27; preferences.

Many shops are family-owned. These family-owned shops may carry purchasing group or wholesaler group branding. Alternatively the private owner choosing to do his own purchasing (usually from cash and carries) may carry advertising for a local paper, national news group or soft drink brand externally. Prior to the banning of advertising of tobacco products, this was the most common form of external advertising. The primary employers association aimed towards looking after the interests of independent newsagents in the UK and Ireland is the National Federation of Retail Newsagents.

Others are part of national chains such as The Co-op and WHSmith. Mini-marts, off-licences and supermarkets may also act as newsagents.

===United States===

On street corners in New York City, for instance, newsstands are often shacks constructed of steel beams and aluminium siding or roofing tin; and require a city permit to build and operate. Other New York newsstands are located inside airports, hotels and office buildings – and even beneath street level in underground concourses or on subway platforms. Hudson News, a newsstand brand created in New York City, is operated by retailer the Hudson Group, with more than 500 stores around the world. This brand was created in 1987, and became more popular in the 1990s, during a time when newsstands in commuter terminals were being re-evaluated and reopened to better serve customers and the spaces with the most commuter foot traffic. Prior to this, newsstands caused limited visibility for police officers patrolling the subway stations, as well as impeding crowd movement.

<doc id="964274" wikidata="Q1105882" url="?curid=964274" title="Bourbon Street">
<text>Bourbon Street (, ) is a historic street in the heart of the French Quarter of New Orleans. Extending twelve blocks from Canal Street to Esplanade Avenue, Bourbon Street is famous for its many bars and strip clubs.

With 17.74 million visitors in 2017 alone, New Orleans depends on Bourbon Street as a main tourist attraction. Tourist numbers have been growing yearly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the city has successfully rebuilt its tourist base. For millions of visitors each year, Bourbon Street provides a rich insight into New Orleans&#x27; past.

==History of Bourbon Street and environs==
===1700 to 1880===

The French claimed Louisiana in the 1690s, and Jean Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville was appointed Director General in charge of developing a colony in the territory. He founded New Orleans in 1718. In 1721, the royal engineer Adrien de Pauger designed the city&#x27;s street layout. He named the streets after French royal houses and Catholic saints. He paid homage to France&#x27;s ruling family, the House of Bourbon, with the naming of Bourbon Street.

New Orleans was transferred to Spain in 1763 following the Seven Years&#x27; War. The Great New Orleans Fire of 1788 destroyed 80 percent of the city&#x27;s buildings. The Spanish rebuilt many of the damaged structures, which are still standing today, so that Bourbon Street and the French Quarter display more Spanish than French influence.

Following a brief restoration of French rule, the United States gained control of the colony with the 1803 Louisiana Purchase. They translated the French street names into English, with Rue Bourbon becoming Bourbon Street.

During the 19th century, New Orleans was similar to other Southern cities in that its economy was based on selling cash crops, such as sugar and tobacco. By 1840, newcomers whose wealth came from these enterprises turned New Orleans into the third largest metropolis in the country. The city&#x27;s port was the nation&#x27;s second largest, after New York City&#x27;s.

The main difference between New Orleans and other Southern cities was its unique cultural heritage from having been a French and Spanish possession. Promoters emphasized this cultural legacy, in the form of its architecture, cuisine and traditions, to attract tourists to New Orleans.

===1880 to 1960===
The French Quarter was central to this image of cultural legacy and became the best-known part of the city. Recent arrivals in New Orleans criticized the perceived loose morals of the Creoles, a perception that drew many travelers to New Orleans to drink, gamble and visit the city&#x27;s brothels, beginning in the 1880s.

Bourbon Street was a desirable residential area before about 1900. This changed in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when the Storyville red-light district was constructed on Basin Street adjacent to the French Quarter. The area became known for prostitution, gambling and vaudeville acts. Jazz is said to have developed here, with artists such as King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton providing musical entertainment at the brothels.

This was also the era when some of New Orleans&#x27; most famous restaurants were founded. Galatoire&#x27;s, at 209 Bourbon Street was established by Jean Galatoire in 1905. Known for years by its characteristic line snaking down Bourbon Street, patrons waited for hours just to get a table, especially on Fridays.

Before World War II, the French Quarter was emerging as a major asset to the city&#x27;s economy. While there was an interest in historic districts at the time, developers pressured to modernize the city. Simultaneously, with the wartime influx of people, property owners opened adult-centered nightclubs to capitalize on the city&#x27;s risqué image. Wartime Bourbon Street was memorably depicted in Erle Stanley Gardner&#x27;s detective novel &quot;Owls Don&#x27;t Blink&quot;. After the war, Bourbon Street became the new Storyville in terms of reputation. By the 1940s and 1950s, nightclubs lined Bourbon Street; there were over 50 different burlesque and striptease shows and venues with exotic dancers.

===Since 1960===

There was a move in the 1960s under District Attorney Jim Garrison to clean up Bourbon Street. In August 1962, two months after he was elected, Garrison began raiding adult entertainment establishments on Bourbon. His efforts mirrored those of his predecessors, which had been largely unsuccessful; however, he had more success. He forced closure on a dozen nightclubs convicted of prostitution and selling overpriced alcohol. Following this campaign, Bourbon Street became populated by peep shows and sidewalk beer stands.

When Mayor Moon Landrieu came into office in 1970, he focused his efforts on stimulating tourism. He did so by making Bourbon Street a pedestrian mall, making it more inviting. The 1980s and 1990s were characterized by a Disneyfication of Bourbon Street. Critics of the rapid increase of souvenir shops and corporate ventures said that Bourbon Street had become Creole Disneyland, and that the street&#x27;s authenticity had been lost in this process.

On April 5, 2018, a giant saxophone, nearly high, was installed in the street, a gift from Namur, Belgium to commemorate that the inventor of the instrument, Adolphe Sax, was from Dinant in Namur.

====Impact of Hurricane Katrina====

Given Bourbon Street&#x27;s high-ground location in the French Quarter, it was mostly intact following 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina. A major tourist attraction, Bourbon Street renovation was given high priority after the storm. However, New Orleans was still experiencing a lack of visitors. In 2004, the year before Katrina, the city had 10.1 million visitors. The year after the storm, that number was 3.7 million.

One third of the city&#x27;s operating budget, approximately $6 billion before Katrina, came from visitors and conventions, so officials saw tourism as vital for post-disaster economic recovery.

The New Orleans Tourism Marketing Corporation initiated efforts to draw visitors back to the city, featuring celebrities such as Emeril Lagasse and Patricia Clarkson with the slogan, &quot;Come fall In love with Louisiana all over again.&quot; Travelers heard mixed messages in the media. Advertising campaigns gave the impression that New Orleans was thriving, while city leaders asked for increased federal financial assistance and National Guard troops to help control municipal crime waves.

New Orleans has been working its way back to pre-Katrina tourist numbers, as it attracted 9.5 million visitors in 2014 and 10.5 million visitors in 2016. The 2016 record was the highest since 2004.

For a time in April 2017, the 100 block of Bourbon Street was closed off for reconstruction of the street and its underground utilities as part of the city&#x27;s $6 million French Quarter infrastructure project.

==== Impact of COVID-19 ====

The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 profoundly impacted this renowned destination, triggering a series of unprecedented challenges and transformations that reverberated throughout the local community and beyond. The effects of COVID-19 on Bourbon Street were far-reaching, encompassing economic, social, and cultural dimensions. The implementation of strict public health measures, including lockdowns and capacity restrictions, dealt a significant blow to the area&#x27;s economy, particularly its hospitality sector. On Saturday, July 25, the first day of the ban, the morning pace was about the same as a normal day on Bourbon Street but by afternoon, it had picked up to 17 to 20 people per minute, and steadily increased over the next eight hours, peaking between 10 and 10:30 p.m. to around 58 people per minute. Few appeared to be holding drinks, and those who did had probably purchased cans or bottles at stores, as all the bars and music clubs were closed.

According to a report by &quot;The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate&quot;, the closure of bars, restaurants, and entertainment venues along Bourbon Street led to substantial revenue losses and widespread layoffs, plunging many businesses into financial distress. Moreover, the absence of tourists, who typically flock to the street year-round, further exacerbated the economic downturn, with hotel occupancy rates plummeting to historic lows. Beyond its economic ramifications, the pandemic also reshaped the social landscape of Bourbon Street. Traditional gatherings and cultural events, such as Mardi Gras festivities and live music performances, were either canceled or significantly scaled back to comply with public health guidelines. The profound impact of these cancellations on the local community was highlighted in a study conducted by researchers from Tulane University, which underscored the emotional toll of lost traditions and communal rituals.

====2025 attack====
On January 1, 2025, 15 people were killed and 35 were injured when a pickup truck driven by US Army veteran Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a US citizen, drove into a crowd of people walking on Bourbon Street, in what New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell described as a &quot;terrorist attack.&quot; Jabbar left the vehicle and attacked with firearms; he was later killed in a standoff with police. There was a flag of Islamist terrorist group ISIS in the bed of the vehicle. Due to the attack, the 2025 Sugar Bowl, which had been scheduled to be held that day in the local Superdome, was postponed to the following day.

==Entertainment, bars, and restaurants==

Largely quiet during the day, Bourbon Street comes alive at night – particularly during the French Quarter&#x27;s many festivals. Most famous of these is the annual Mardi Gras celebration, when the streets teem with thousands of people. Local open container laws allow drinking alcoholic beverages on the Quarter&#x27;s streets. Popular drinks include the hurricane cocktail, the resurrection cocktail, the hand grenade and the so-called &quot;huge-ass beers&quot; – a large plastic cup of draft beer sold cheaply to tourists.

The most-visited section of Bourbon Street is &quot;upper Bourbon Street&quot; toward Canal Street, an eight-block section of visitor attractions including bars, restaurants, souvenir shops and strip clubs. In the 21st century, Bourbon Street is the home of New Orleans Musical Legends Park, a free, outdoor venue for live jazz performances. The park has sculptures and other tributes to the city&#x27;s legendary music personalities. Also home to Larry Flynts&#x27; Iconic flagship Hustler Club.

Most of the bars are located in the central section of Bourbon. Popular spots include Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, Johnny White&#x27;s, the Famous Door, Spirits on Bourbon, Channing Tatum&#x27;s Saints and Sinners, Razzoo and The Cat&#x27;s Meow. Marie Laveau&#x27;s House of Voodoo is located on the corner of St. Ann Street.

The most renowned restaurant on Bourbon Street is Galatoire&#x27;s; it represents traditional New Orleans dining and has a dress code. Lafitte&#x27;s Blacksmith Shop and the Old Absinthe House are two of the many casual eateries. Also notable is the locals’ hangout, the Bourbon House.

&quot;Lower Bourbon Street&quot; (lower being a reference to downriver, or downstream Mississippi River), from the intersection of St. Ann Street, caters to New Orleans&#x27; thriving gay community. Featuring such establishments as Oz and the city&#x27;s largest gay nightclub, the Bourbon Pub, St. Ann Street has been referred to as &quot;the Velvet Line&quot; or &quot;the Lavender Line,&quot; the edge or approximate boundary of the French Quarter&#x27;s gay community. Cafe-Lafitte-in-Exile is the oldest gay bar in the nation. The intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann Streets is also the center of the Labor Day weekend event Southern Decadence, commonly referred to as the Gay Mardi Gras, which attracts upwards of 100,000 participants.

Bourbon Street&#x27;s nightlife is also a major part of its entertainment, bar, and restaurant places like Bourbon Bandstand, Fritezel&#x27;s Jazz Club, Half Past Whiskey, are mainstays for concerts or just good night-out on Bourbon Street.

==Legal issues==

Historically, noise violations were the responsibility of the individual making the noise. This changed in 1996 with &quot;Yokum v. 615 Bourbon Street,&quot; which ruled that the property owner, not the noise-maker, is responsible for noise violations. A 2010 city ordinance states that no music may be played in the French Quarter between 8 pm and 9 am. Enforcement has been inconsistent, and critics claim its goals are vague. Some even say that the local law is unconstitutional. Besides being difficult to enforce, music enthusiasts claim that noise ordinances threaten the city&#x27;s notable music culture. Local jazz bands who play in the streets, such as the To Be Continued Brass Band, would be prohibited from doing so under such ordinances.

&quot;Aggressive solicitation&quot; bans are a more recent issue on Bourbon Street. In 2011, an ordinance was passed which prohibited individuals and groups from &quot;disseminating any social, political or religious message&quot; at night. The ordinance did not explain the justification for the rule. On September 21, 2012, the ACLU of Louisiana won a temporary restraining order against the ban, on behalf of Kelsey McCauley (Bohn), a woman who converted to Christianity through a religious group&#x27;s activities on Bourbon Street. The group had several of its members arrested, some of whom were cited on September 14, 2012, for violating the anti-solicitation ordinance. A hearing was set for October 1, 2012.

On July 25, 2013, the New Orleans City Council voted 6-0 to amend the law and exempt Bourbon Street from the ban, with legal language found acceptable by the participating attorneys.
