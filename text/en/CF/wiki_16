<text>Rheostatics are a Canadian indie rock band. They were formed in 1978, and actively performed from 1980 until disbanding in 2007. After a number of reunion performances at special events, Rheostatics reformed in late 2016, introducing new songs and performing semi-regularly.

Although they had only one Top 40 hit, &quot;Claire&quot; in 1995, they were simultaneously one of Canada&#x27;s most influential and unconventional rock bands, a band whose eclectic take on pop and rock music has been described both as iconic and iconoclastic. In particular, two of the band&#x27;s albums, &quot;Whale Music&quot; and &quot;Melville&quot;, have been cited in numerous critical and listener polls as among the best Canadian albums ever recorded.

==History==

===Early years===
Formed in Etobicoke, Ontario in 1978, the band played their first gig at a club called The Edge in February 1980. The band originally consisted of guitarist Dave Bidini, bassist Tim Vesely, drummer Rod Westlake and keyboard player Dave Crosby. Westlake left the band almost immediately, however, and was replaced by Dave Clark. Crosby left the band in 1981. In their earliest years, the band members were all still teenagers, and required special permits to play in most music venues.

The band&#x27;s early sound was more R&amp;B and funk-oriented than their later, more famous, music. A large horn section, known as The Trans-Canada Soul Patrol, accompanied the group from 1983 to 1985; Clark had met the horn players while taking a jazz class at a summer music school. After the departure of the horn section, Martin Tielli was brought in. Tielli and Clark had previously been bandmates in the group Water Tower.

In the early 1980s the Rheostatics released a number of independent singles, and the three song demo &quot;Canadian Dream&quot;. The best-known of these early singles was &quot;The Ballad of Wendel Clark, Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot;, an ode to the Toronto Maple Leafs player Wendel Clark, which became the band&#x27;s first hit on college radio and CFNY. In 1987, these songs were collected as the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Only 1,000 copies of this album were pressed and released originally, and quickly sold out. The album was eventually re-released in 1996. The band also played a role in drawing Canadian country music icon Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors out of retirement, after Bidini and Vesely crashed Connors&#x27; birthday party in 1986 and wrote an article about it for a Toronto newspaper.

Martin Tielli left the band at the end of 1988, and shortly thereafter the Rheostatics broke up. During the hiatus, Bidini and Clark played a number of shows as supporting musicians for the recently reunited Three O&#x27;Clock Train. However, by 1990 the band reunited with exactly the same line-up they had in mid-1988: Bidini, Clark, Tielli and Vesely.

===Classic era===
In 1991, the band signed to the independent label Intrepid Records, and released &quot;Melville&quot; that year. The single &quot;Record Body Count&quot; garnered them significant airplay on radio and MuchMusic. The album also featured an enigmatic cover of Gordon Lightfoot&#x27;s &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;.

The following year, the band signed to Sire Records and released &quot;Whale Music&quot;, which was inspired by Paul Quarrington&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;Whale Music&quot;. Quarrington himself was so impressed by &quot;Whale Music&quot;&#x27;s quirky pop—which was perfectly suited to a novel about a quirky, reclusive pop genius liberally based on Brian Wilson—that he chose the band to compose the soundtrack to the film version of his novel. &quot;Music from the Motion Picture Whale Music&quot; was released in 1994, putting the band in the odd position of having two almost identically-titled albums in its catalogue.

The centrepiece of the soundtrack was &quot;Claire&quot;, a love song from the main character in the movie to a woman who&#x27;d moved into his house, which became Rheostatics&#x27; first and only Top 40 hit and earned the band a Genie Award for Best Original Song in 1994. &quot;Claire&quot; was also featured on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Introducing Happiness&quot;, released the same year. That album proved to be the end of the Rheostatics&#x27; association with Sire, however, as the label found the band difficult to market.

It was also Clark&#x27;s last album with the band, as he left to concentrate on his own band, The Dinner Is Ruined. The resignation came very shortly before a cross-Canada tour. Clark has stated in interviews that he left because he was uncomfortable with the chart success of &quot;Claire&quot; and feared that the rest of the band would be persuaded to evolve in a mainstream direction. Tielli&#x27;s perspective on &quot;Claire&quot;, however, was very different:

Clark was replaced by Don Kerr, whose first performance with the Rheostatics was an unannounced show at the Horseshoe Tavern in the winter of 1995. Also in 1995, the band first toured with The Tragically Hip as part of the Another Roadside Attraction festival.

Later in 1995, the band attracted the attention of the National Gallery of Canada, who commissioned the band to write music to accompany a retrospective celebrating the 75th anniversary of another group of artists whose distinctive-yet-accessible artistic outlook had redefined Canadian art, the Group of Seven. That year, working with pianist Kevin Hearn (later of the Barenaked Ladies) and the experimental hip hop group Farm Fresh, they released &quot;Music Inspired by the Group of Seven&quot; on the independent label DROG Records. Bob Wiseman would sit in for Hearn at the Art Gallery of Ontario show due to Hearn&#x27;s illness.

The band also opened for the Tragically Hip on that band&#x27;s tour to support the album &quot;Trouble at the Henhouse&quot;; this tour culminated in the release of the Tragically Hip’s live album &quot;Live Between Us&quot; in May 1997, wherein front man Gordon Downie opens the album – and show – by saying, over the beginning of the first track “Grace Too”, &quot;“This is for the Rheostatics – we are all richer for having seen them tonight”.&quot;

Rheostatics then returned to the studio, and released &quot;The Blue Hysteria&quot; in 1996. This album garnered airplay for the single &quot;Bad Time to Be Poor,&quot; a scathing indictment of life in Ontario during the government of Mike Harris.

In 1997, the band released &quot;Double Live&quot;, a live album documenting the band in a variety of settings, from small in-store sessions to the large arenas of their tour with The Tragically Hip. The album was very successful on the campus radio charts and is amongst fans&#x27; favorites discs.

===Later years===
On August 31, 1997 the group performed a live session for the last episode of &quot;Night Lines&quot;, a music show on CBC Radio Two. Performances from this session were released on 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Nightlines Sessions&quot;.

In 1999, the band released &quot;The Story of Harmelodia&quot;, an album based on a children&#x27;s story written by Bidini. The album, which featured the band&#x27;s songs interspersed with narration by Bidini&#x27;s wife, Janet Morassutti, detailed the adventures of Dot and Bug, two children from the land of Harmelodia who fell through a hole into the land of Popopolis. The album was packaged with a book featuring Tielli&#x27;s illustrated text of Bidini&#x27;s story. Hearn and the band&#x27;s frequent producer, Michael Phillip Wojewoda, contributed significantly to the recording and are listed as members of the band.

In 2001, Rheostatics released &quot;Night of the Shooting Stars&quot; on Perimeter Records. Though Kerr plays on the album, it was announced prior to its release that he would be departing from the band. The reasons given were his desire to focus on his work at Gas Station Recording Studios in Toronto, as well as his role in Ron Sexsmith&#x27;s group. Kerr was replaced by Wojewoda.

In late 2001, the band revived their tradition of a week&#x27;s club residency, formerly known as &quot;Green Sprouts Music Week&quot;, and played 11 straight evenings at Toronto&#x27;s Horseshoe Tavern. Performances from these shows were included on their sole DVD release, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Maple Serum: Rheostatics Live at the Horseshoe Tavern&quot;. The event was dubbed the &quot;Fall Nationals&quot; and was repeated for the next three years. Performances from the 2004 Fall Nationals make up the album &quot;Calling Out the Chords, Vol. 1&quot;, released in 2005.

Their tenth studio album, &quot;2067&quot;, was released in the fall of 2004. Their final studio release was an eponymous, digital-format track of the song &quot;Pornography&quot;, released in late 2004. Both were put out by True North Records.

Two live albums followed in 2005, &quot;The Whale Music Concert, 1992&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Calling Out the Chords, Vol. 1&quot;, the latter being released in digital format only.

On March 30, 2012, the fifth anniversary of the group&#x27;s final show at Massey Hall, a live album, &quot;Green Sprouts Music Week 1993&quot; was released. The album is a distillation and resequencing of material drawn from the band&#x27;s first Green Sprouts Music Week, held from April 12 to 18, 1993 at Ultrasound Showbar in Toronto. Two singles, live versions of &quot;Record Body Count&quot; and &quot;Woodstuck&quot;, were released in digital format and also sent to radio stations.

===Breakup and final show===
Tim Vesely publicly announced his departure from the band on September 8, 2006, citing his desire to concentrate on his side project The Violet Archers. However, Bidini has indicated that Vesely made his intentions to leave known to the band in January 2006, after they had played a series of concerts in Calgary.

Bidini and Tielli explored the possibility of continuing the band with Wojewoda and collaborating keyboardist Ford Pier, but these plans collapsed after Wojewoda declared he did not want to commit to the band. Subsequent press indicated that the band would not continue following Vesely&#x27;s exit.

After it was revealed that Vesely would be leaving, Bidini embarked on a solo tour and chronicled his experience in the 2007 book &quot;Around the World in 57½ Gigs&quot;.

On March 16, 2007, Canadian web label Zunior released a Rheostatics tribute album, &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;, which had not been publicized in advance so that it would be a surprise for the band.

A farewell concert was planned and on March 30, 2007, the Rheostatics played Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall, the largest venue that they had played as headliners. The concert was recorded for later broadcast on CBC Radio Two&#x27;s &quot;Canada Live&quot;, which aired the show on April 7 and again on December 6. Ford Pier substituted for Vesely in some live performances between Vesely&#x27;s announcement and the final show.

Bidini and Tielli have continued working together after the Massey Hall show. The first of such projects was a musical-theatre piece entitled &quot;Five Hole: Tales of Hockey Erotica&quot;, produced in collaboration with One Yellow Rabbit. Music from the production was recorded by Bidini, Tielli, Pier, Selina Martin and Barry Mirochnick, and released on the album &quot;Music from Five Hole: Tales of Hockey Erotica&quot; in February 2009 on Zunior. Vesely and Wojewoda contribute to two tracks.

===Reunions===

On October 24, 2009, the band reunited to perform at an event put on by Toronto&#x27;s International Festival of Authors and Humber College, produced by Judith Keenan of BookShorts, honouring Paul Quarrington, shortly after the late author had publicized his diagnosis with inoperable lung cancer. The former members who had performed were Bidini, Clark, Hearn, Kerr, Tielli and Vesely. They performed two songs: &quot;Claire&quot; followed by &quot;Dope Fiends and Boozehounds&quot;. Bidini also hosted the entire event.

Rheostatics announced three reunion concerts to take place on December 5 and 6, 2012 with a lineup of Bidini, Clark, Tielli and Vesely to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. The shows were ultimately cancelled nine days prior to the planned dates due to Martin Tielli&#x27;s inability to perform. The owner of Six Shooter Records (the band&#x27;s label) indicates that Tielli told her it was due to his long-time battle with stage fright.

On April 12, 2014, Rheostatics (Bidini, Kerr, Tielli, Vesely) performed with Bidiniband and various guests as part of the 2nd Annual Stompin&#x27; Tom Memorial Show at the Horseshoe Tavern.

On September 4, 5 and 6, 2015, Rheostatics (Bidini, Kerr, Tielli, Vesely) with Kevin Hearn, plus guest Hugh Marsh performed the album &quot;Music Inspired by the Group of Seven&quot; in its entirety at the Art Gallery of Ontario. They also performed an unannounced nine song set on September 3, 2015 as part of a tribute concert at the Art Gallery of Ontario. In the early hours of September 7, 2015 Rheostatics performed with various guests at an after party at the Monarch Tavern after the performance at the AGO.

On April 29, 2016, Rheostatics (Bidini, Kerr, Tielli, Vesely) with Kevin Hearn and Hugh Marsh performed at Massey Hall. They performed a warm-up show on April 24, 2016 at the Starlight Social Club in Waterloo, Ontario with the same line-up.

On August 27, 2016, Rheostatics (Bidini, Kerr, Tielli, Vesely) with Kevin Hearn and Hugh Marsh headlined at the Harvest Picnic festival (Christie Lake, Ontario). On September 18, 2016 the same line-up performed at the Toronto Urban Roots Festival (TURF).

===Reforming===
On December 9 and 10, 2016, Rheostatics (Bidini, Clark, Tielli, Vesely, Hearn, Marsh) performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, where five new songs were debuted: &quot;Mountains and the Sea&quot; (Bidini), &quot;Music is the Message&quot; (Vesely), &quot;Chemical Valley&quot; (Hearn), &quot;Albatross&quot; (Tielli) and &quot;It&#x27;s the Super Controller!&quot; (Clark). With Dave Clark returning to the drum kit, and the introduction of new material by all members, this show marked a return to regular, if infrequent, performances. 
On January 1, 2017, the band appeared on &quot;The Hip 30&quot;, a special Tragically Hip tribute episode of CBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Strombo Show&quot;, performing a cover of the Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot;.

In June 2018, Rheostatics started recording sessions for a new album. &quot;Here Come the Wolves&quot; was released on September 6, 2019. It is their twelfth album and their first album of original material in 14 years.

==Style==

The band&#x27;s style was highly eclectic, feeding off the creative cross-pollination of each member&#x27;s distinct musical style, and was marked by a willingness to experiment with just about any musical idea. Tielli&#x27;s material tended toward progressive rock and folk rock, Bidini brought quirky humour and new wave influences, Vesely pursued a relatively mainstream pop-rock orientation which meant that his songs (including both &quot;Claire&quot; and &quot;Bad Time to Be Poor&quot;) garnered nearly all of the band&#x27;s radio airplay, and Clark&#x27;s songs were punk-flavoured.

While this eclecticism appealed to the band&#x27;s fans, it also made them difficult for a major label to market – some of their later albums, especially &quot;Introducing Happiness&quot;, were described by critics as playing more like compilation albums than the work of a single band with a coherent and unified vision. Bobby Baker of The Tragically Hip remarked in 1997, &quot;I think maybe they&#x27;re a little too good for their own good.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In a 1996 reader poll published by &quot;Chart&quot; to determine the 100 best Canadian albums, &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed fifth, behind only Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, The Tragically Hip and Sloan. Their album &quot;Melville&quot; placed sixteenth. When the magazine conducted a follow-up poll in 2000, &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed fourth and &quot;Melville&quot; placed fifth. In the 2005 poll, &quot;Whale Music&quot; placed tenth, becoming one of six albums to place in the top ten all three times, and &quot;Melville&quot; placed 44th. In all of the magazine&#x27;s three polls, Neil Young is the only other artist to have achieved the distinction of placing two albums in the top five in the same year.

In Bob Mersereau&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Top 100 Canadian Albums&quot;, &quot;Whale Music&quot; ranked nineteenth and &quot;Melville&quot; was ranked 38th.

In June 2009, Rheostatics and Eric&#x27;s Trip were the first artists to be inducted into Zunior&#x27;s Independent Music Hall of Fame. The official illustration of the group, by Trevor Waurechen, depicts Bidini, Clark, Hearn, Kerr, Tielli, Vesely and Wojewoda.

==Member timeline==
==Legacy==
Australian novelist Patrick Holland claimed the &#x27;gas station&#x27; scene from his novel &quot;The Mary Smokes Boys&quot; was inspired by &quot;Whale Music&quot;&#x27;s &#x27;Self Serve Gas Station&#x27;.

<text>[[Serbia and Montenegro]] competed at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Previously known as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, this was the nation&#x27;s third and last joint appearance at the Summer Olympics before Serbia and Montenegro became separated independent states in 2006. The Olympic Committee of Serbia and Montenegro sent a total of 85 athletes to the Games, 78 men and 7 women, to compete in 14 sports. Men&#x27;s basketball, football, volleyball, and water polo were the only team-based sports in which Serbia and Montenegro had its representation at these Games. There was only a single competitor in road cycling, judo, tennis, and wrestling.

The Serbia and Montenegro team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including the reigning men&#x27;s volleyball champions (led by team captain Vladimir Grbić), and pistol shooter Jasna Šekarić, who became the first Serbian athlete to compete in five Olympic Games under three different banners (the other were SFR Yugoslavia and Independent Olympic Participants). Meanwhile, four Serbia and Montenegro athletes had made their fourth Olympic appearance: high jumper Dragutin Topić, shot putter Dragan Perić (the oldest of the team at age 40), rifle shooter Stevan Pletikosić, and table tennis player Slobodan Grujić. Basketball team captain Dejan Bodiroga was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Serbia and Montenegro ended its last Olympic journey as a joint nation in Athens with two Olympic silver medals from Sekaric and the men&#x27;s water polo team (led by Viktor Jelenić).
These would be the last Summer Games in which athletes from Montenegro and Serbia participated as Yugoslavia as they both competed separately in the 2008 Olympics

<doc id="943790" wikidata="Q1284235" url="?curid=943790" title="Index.dat">
<text>In the Microsoft Windows operating system, index.dat is a hidden database file used by the Internet Explorer web browser. It functions as an information storage database of recent browser activity, enabling quick access to that information when needed again by Internet Explorer, thus improving browser performance.

==Function==
The index.dat file is a database file. It is a repository of information such as web URLs, search queries and recently opened files. Its purpose is to enable quick access to data used by Internet Explorer. For example, every web address visited is stored in the index.dat file, allowing Internet Explorer to quickly find Autocomplete matches as the user types a web address. The index.dat file is user-specific and is open as long as a user is logged into his or her Windows user account. Separate index.dat files exist for the Internet Explorer history, cache, and cookies.

The index.dat file is never resized or deleted. A large index.dat file can impair performance.

:Note: The &quot;.dat&quot; extension is commonly used for &quot;data&quot; files (files that are not human-readable and do not hold a document-based binary file). It&#x27;s possible to find files named &#x27;index.dat&#x27; that are not used by Internet Explorer.

==Controversy==

Internet privacy groups say that the use of index.dat files in the Windows operating system is an invasion of users&#x27; privacy. The information contained in an index.dat file can be considered private to the user. One of the groups&#x27; main complaints is that the index.dat files cannot easily be deleted. This is because windows prevents open or &quot;locked&quot; files from being deleted. 

It has been contended that the method provided by the Windows operating system for removing information from the index.dat files gives a false sense of security. Although the internet cache directory can be cleared, its use cannot be disabled. Also, removing individual entries from an index.dat file (for example, by using Windows Explorer) only prevents those entries being used; it does not remove the files referenced until the next &quot;cleanup&quot;. (Marking single entries as deleted rather than erasing them is a common database method of quickly removing items from use whilst also retaining those items should it be desirable to reverse the deletion.)

While employees of Microsoft have claimed that the Windows operating system deliberately hides index.dat files, users of the Microsoft system point to the fact that Windows Explorer offers users a detailed view of the content of the files when browsing containing directories, therefore allowing anybody using the system to look at and even change and remove their Internet data.

Some spyware target the index.dat file for unauthorized reading and/or editing. Computer forensics commonly look at index.dat as part of their analysis of computer use.

==Removal tools==

Various free programs (among them Red Button, CCleaner, and Index.dat Suite), can completely remove index.dat files until they are recreated by Windows, though CCleaner, and perhaps the others, does not delete the hidden index.dat file in the Temporary Internet Files directory, which contains a copy of the cookies that were in the Cookies directory. However, if Secure Deletion is enabled in CCleaner then this will effectively wipe the contents of this file although the size will continue to increase with use.

==Supported on==

Index.dat is only available up to Internet Explorer 9. Internet Explorer 10 and 11 do not have index.dat files. Instead, Internet Explorer 10 and 11 use WebCacheV01.dat.

<doc id="943799" wikidata="Q3651068" url="?curid=943799" title="Calvin and the Colonel">
<text>Calvin and the Colonel is an American animated sitcom about Colonel Montgomery J. Klaxon, a shrewd fox, and Calvin T. Burnside, a dumb bear. Their lawyer was Oliver Wendell Clutch, who was a (literal) weasel. The colonel lived with his wife Maggie Belle and her sister Susan Culpepper, who did not trust the Colonel at all. Colonel Klaxon was in the real estate business, but always tried get-rich-quick schemes with Calvin&#x27;s unwitting help.

==Series overview==
The series was an animated remake of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; [or, more or less, &quot;Andy and The Kingfish&quot;] and featured the voices of Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll from the radio series (in fact, several of the original radio scripts by Joe Connelly &amp; Bob Mosher were adapted for this series). Using animals avoided the touchy racial issues which had led to the downfall of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;.

Because of low ratings, the show was cancelled after two months, but returned two months later on Saturday evenings to complete the first season contract (and to fulfill Lever Brothers&#x27; agreement to sponsor the program; they originally sponsored &quot;The Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy Show&quot; on radio during the 1940s). For a year afterward reruns were seen on Saturday mornings, and eventually syndicated through the 1960s. It was also adapted as a comic book by Dell Comics, and as such the first of two issues was the final installment in the company&#x27;s extremely prolific (more than 1,300 issues published) &quot;Four Color&quot; anthology series. Despite its low ratings in America, the series gained popularity in Australia during its initial run, with reruns airing on Channel 7 up to the late 1980s.

A brief sequence from the show was seen on a television set in a 1966 episode of &quot;The Munsters&quot; (&quot;A Visit From Johann&quot;), which was also produced by Connelly and Mosher.

Much like other animated sitcom programs of the time (&quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;Top Cat&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;), the series had a laugh track in the episodes.

<doc id="943802" wikidata="Q946600" url="?curid=943802" title="1996 World Cup of Hockey">
<text>The first World Cup of Hockey (WCH), or the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, was the inaugural edition of the event, replacing the Canada Cup as one the world championships of ice hockey.

==Inaugural &quot;World Cup of Hockey&quot;==
The first edition of the Cup featured eight teams divided into two groups. The European Group, whose games were all played in European cities, included the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, and Sweden. The North American Group played in North American cities and included Canada, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States. Some of the best players in the world were missing in the tournament, some either declined invitation, such as Dominik Hašek stating &quot;I would love to play in (the competition), but the timing is bad&quot;, or because of injuries, as Pavel Bure was injured during a Russia–USA exhibition game in Detroit.

After the teams played a three-game group stage, the top team in each group advanced to the semi-finals, while the second and third place teams played cross-over quarter-finals. The quarter-finals and semi-finals were single elimination games. The championship final was a best-of-three. All playoff games were played in North America.

In the biggest surprise of the tournament, Germany defeated the Czech Republic 7–1 in the European Group, which eliminated the Czechs and sent the Germans into the quarter-finals. In the biggest game of the North American Group, the USA defeated Canada 5–3 to finish first and get a bye to the semi-finals. In the semis, they defeated Russia 5–2, while Canada beat Sweden 3–2 on Theoren Fleury&#x27;s goal at 19:47 of the second overtime period, ending the longest game in international hockey history.

The tournament did see some controversy after the Canada–Russia game in Vancouver was played when Sweden&#x27;s coach Kent Forsberg said he believed &quot;Canada cheated its way to victory&quot; through help of Canadian NHL referees that saw two goals disallowed and several controversial penalties for Russia. The Russian team&#x27;s coach Boris Mikhailov echoed a similar sentiment after the game saying &quot;It was the referees&#x27; victory&quot;, as Russia felt there was &quot;biased officiating&quot;.

In the best-of-three final, Canada won the first game, in Philadelphia, 4–3 in overtime. Then the USA recorded a memorable pair of 5–2 victories in Montreal to win the series. In the third and decisive game, the USA received spectacular goaltending from tournament MVP Mike Richter and rallied from a 2–1 deficit in the third period by scoring four goals in the final 3:18 of the game. Tony Amonte scored the game-winning goal.

<doc id="943809" wikidata="Q147207" url="?curid=943809" title="Croatia at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Croatia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics since the post-Yugoslav era. The Croatian Olympic Committee (, &quot;HOO&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since its debut in 1992. A total of 81 athletes, 66 men and 15 women, competed in 14 sports. Men&#x27;s water polo, and men&#x27;s handball were the only team-based sports in which Croatia had its representation in these Olympic Games.

The Croatian team featured three Olympic medalists from Sydney: rowers and brothers Nikša and Siniša Skelin, and four-time Olympian and defending weightlifting champion Nikolaj Pešalov in the men&#x27;s lightweight class. Table tennis player and Olympic silver medalist Zoran Primorac became the first Croatian to participate in five Olympic Games as an individual athlete (his first appearance competed under the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Former Bosnian athlete and discus thrower Dragan Mustapić served as the team captain and oldest member of the team at age 41, while backstroke swimmer Sanja Jovanović was youngest at age 17. Three-time Olympic water polo player and two-time medalist Dubravko Šimenc was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Croatia left Athens with a total of five medals (one gold, two silver, and two bronze), being considered as the nation&#x27;s most successful Olympics in history based on the overall medal tally. All of these medals were awarded for the first time to the Croatian athletes in swimming, men&#x27;s coxless pair in rowing, and men&#x27;s tennis doubles. Meanwhile, Croatia men&#x27;s handball team (led by team captain Venio Losert) proved particularly successful in Athens, as they beat the Germans for their only gold medal at these Games, adding it to their previous record from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

<doc id="943811" wikidata="Q1398771" url="?curid=943811" title="Tiberius Cavallo">
<text>Tiberius Cavallo (also Tiberio) (30 March 1749, Naples, Kingdom of Naples21 December 1809, London, England) was an Italian physicist and natural philosopher. 
His interests included electricity, the development of scientific instruments, the nature of &quot;airs&quot;, and ballooning. 
He became both a Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Naples, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1779. 
Between 1780 and 1792, he presented the Royal Society&#x27;s Bakerian Lecture thirteen times in succession.

==Life==
Tiberius Cavallo was born on 30 March 1749 at Naples, Italy where his father was a physician.
In 1771 he moved to England.

Cavallo made several ingenious improvements in scientific instruments.
He is often cited as the inventor of Cavallo&#x27;s multiplier. 
He also developed a &quot;pocket electrometer&quot; that he used to amplify small electric charges to make them observable and measurable with an electroscope. Parts of the instrument were protected from drafts by a glass enclosure.

He also worked on refrigeration. Following the work of William Cullen in 1750 and Joseph Black in 1764, Cavallo was the first to carry out systematic experiments on refrigeration using the evaporation of volatile liquids, in 1781.

He was interested in the physical properties of &quot;airs&quot; or gases, and carried out experiments on &quot;inflammable air&quot; (hydrogen gas).
In his &quot;Treatise on the Nature and Properties of Air&quot; (1781) he made &quot;a judicious examination of contemporary work&quot;, discussing both the phlogiston theory of Joseph Priestley and the contrasting views of Antoine Lavoisier.
In June 1782, a paper of Cavallo&#x27;s was read at the Royal Society, describing the first attempt to lift a hydrogen-filled balloon into the air.
His &quot;History and Practice of Aerostation&quot; (1785) was considered &quot;one of the earliest and best works on aerostation published in eighteenth century England&quot;. In it, Cavallo discusses both recent experiments in ballooning, and its underlying principles. Cavallo targeted a more general audience in this work, avoiding technical jargon and mathematical proofs, and was an effective science communicator to both his peers and the general public. His work influenced pioneer balloonists Jacques Charles, the Robert brothers, and Jean-Pierre Blanchard.

Cavallo also published on musical temperament in his treatise &quot;Of the Temperament of Those Musical Instruments, in Which the Tones, Keys, or Frets, are Fixed, as in the Harpsichord, Organ, Guitar, &amp;c&quot;.
He died in London on 21 December 1809.
He was buried in Old St Pancras Churchyard, reportedly in a vault near that of Pasquale Paoli.
The grave is lost but he is listed on the Burdett Coutts memorial of 1879 to the many important persons buried therein.

==Works==
He published numerous works on different branches of physics, including:
* &quot;Theory and Practice of Medical Electricity&quot; (1780)
* 
* &quot;History and Practice of Aerostation&quot; (1785)
* &quot;Medical Properties of Factitious Air&quot; (1798)
* &quot;Elements of Natural and Experimental Philosophy&quot; (1803)

For &quot;Rees&#x27;s Cyclopædia&quot; he contributed articles on Electricity, Machinery and Mechanics, but the topics are not known.

<text>The convective overturn model of supernovae was proposed by Bethe and Wilson in 1985, and received a dramatic test with SN 1987A, and the detection of neutrinos from the explosion. The model is for type II supernovae, which take place in stars more massive than 8 solar masses.

When the iron core of a super massive star becomes heavier than electron degeneracy pressure can support, the core of the star collapses, and the iron core is compressed by gravity until nuclear densities are reached when a strong rebound sends a shock wave throughout the rest of the star and tears it apart in a large supernova explosion. The remains of this core will eventually become a neutron star. The collapse produces two reactions: one breaks apart iron nuclei into 13 helium atoms and 4 neutrons, absorbing energy; and the second produces a wave of neutrinos that form a shock wave. While all models agree there is a convective shock, there is disagreement as to how important that shock is to the supernova explosion.

In the convective overturn model, the core collapses faster and faster, exceeding the speed of sound inside the star, and producing a supersonic shock wave. This shock wave explodes outward until it stalls when it reaches the &quot;neutrinosphere&quot;, where the pressure of the star collapsing inward exceeds the pressure of the neutrinos radiating outwards. This point produces heavier elements as the neutrinos are absorbed.

The stalling of the shock wave represents the &quot;supernova problem&quot;, because once stalled, the shock wave should not be &quot;reenergized&quot;. The &quot;prompt convection&quot; model states that the shock wave will increase the luminosity of the neutrinos produced by the core collapse, and this increase in energy will start the shock wave again. The &quot;neutron fingers&quot; model has instability near the core expel another wave of energized neutrinos which reenergizes the shock wave. The &quot;entropy convection&quot; model has matter falling inward from above the shock layer down to the &quot;gain radius&quot;, which would not increase neutrino luminosity, but would allow the shock wave to continue outwards.

All of these models exhibit convective overturn in that they rely on a convection mechanism to re-energize the stalled shock wave and complete the supernova explosion.

There are still open issues in both the convective models and in the more general core collapse model, which include not taking into account flavor mixing and mass of neutrinos, and the inability to model large explosions. Current models indicate that the collapse may occur more slowly than thought before, which would mean the shock wave would penetrate further into the upper layers of the star. The proto-neutron star boosts neutrino luminosities, and the additional neutrinos emitted help re-energize the shock wave. These changes remove some, but not all, of the supernova problem, and strengthen the idea of convection being an important factor in supernova explosions.

<text>Area codes 760 and 442 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the U.S. state of California. These area codes serve an overlay complex that comprises much of the southeastern and southernmost portions of California. It includes Imperial, Inyo, and Mono counties, as well as portions of San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino, Los Angeles and Kern countries. Area code 760 was created on March 22, 1997, in a split of area code 619. Area code 442 was added to the same area on November 21, 2009.

==History==
Area code 760 was split from 619 in 1997, and 619 had been split from area code 714 in 1982. Within a decade of creation, the proliferation of cell phones and pagers left area code 760 under the threat of exhausting its central office prefixes. The initial relief plan was another area code split, with the San Diego and Imperial areas moving to a new 442 area code. However, this met with protests from businesses who did not want to change their numbers for the second time in a decade. Ultimately, the California Public Utilities Commission decided that 442 would be added as an overlay to 760. Since 2009 all users in the region have been required to include the area code even when dialing local calls.

Covering , it is the largest numbering plan area in California, with approximately 29% of the state&#x27;s land area served by area codes 760 and 442.

<text>Paul Myers (born 11 November 1960) is a Canadian author, journalist, musician and songwriter. Until 2006, Myers worked as a musician and journalist in Toronto and Vancouver, where he became a television and radio personality. He is the older brother of actor and comedian Mike Myers.

== Career ==
In the 1990s, Myers was the front man and songwriter for the band The Gravelberrys, which had a Canadian alternative hit in the early 1990s with &quot;Wonder Where You Are Tonight.&quot; The group, which took its name from a reference in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, disbanded in 1995, after several complete lineup changes.

Myers, in electronic music, is &quot;Flam!&quot;.

In 1995, Myers began his journalism career, in Toronto. Since that time, he has written for a wide variety of periodicals and newspapers, including Canadian outlets &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot;, &quot;The Vancouver Province&quot;, and &quot;Canadian Musician&quot;, and American publications including &quot;Mix&quot;, &quot;Electronic Musician&quot;, &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Bay Guardian&quot;.

In 2001, Myers&#x27; first long form book, was the authorized biography of the Barenaked Ladies, &quot;Public Stunts, Private Stories&quot;, published in Canada by Madrigal Press and in the US by Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Fireside Books imprint.

In 2001, to 2006, Myers was in Vancouver, British Columbia, holding a variety of positions during this time. Myers was the musician judge on the Canwest Global reality TV series, &quot;Popstars: The One&quot;, and blogged about his experience for the &quot;Vancouver Province&quot;.

Myers and Patrick Maliha were known to viewers of Shaw TV&#x27;s &quot;Urban Rush&quot; as The Movie Guys, appearing in a popular weekly segment which ran from 2003 until 2006, when Myers left Vancouver for the San Francisco area. Myers was also briefly a regular cultural pundit on CTV&#x27;s &quot;The Vicki Gabereau Show&quot;, a national daytime program which taped out of Vancouver.

In 2003, to 2004, Myers hosted a talk radio show on CHMJ (then branded as &quot;MOJO Radio&quot;) in Vancouver. The show was first known as &quot;One, Two, Three with Paul Myers&quot; (after its 1:00 to 3:00 time slot), before being rechristened &quot;The Paul Myers Show&quot;. The show attained cult status, and Myers played host to diverse guests such as They Might Be Giants, Matthew Sweet, Seth MacFarlane, Errol Morris, Randy Bachman, and Rick Nielsen from Cheap Trick, as well as local musicians and touring authors. CHMJ, a Corus radio station, abandoned broader talk radio in 2004 in favour of an all-sports format. Myers joked that despite his acquisition of a Vancouver Canucks jersey, his culture- and music-based topics no longer fit on the sports channel.

In 2007, his second book, a biography of Long John Baldry called &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy: Long John Baldry and the Birth of the British Blues&quot;, was published by Greystone Books in Fall 2007.

While researching the Baldry book, Myers met Vancouver filmmaker Nick Orchard, who enlisted him to write the script and appear in his documentary &quot;Long John Baldry: In The Shadow Of The Blues&quot;. The film has received repeated airing on both the Canadian Bravo network and BBC 4 in the UK. In 2008, Myers was personally nominated for a Gemini Award (the Canadian Emmy) for Best Writing in a Documentary Program or Series, for his work on Orchard&#x27;s film.

In 2010, Jawbone Press published Myers&#x27; third book, &quot;A Wizard, a True Star: Todd Rundgren in the Studio&quot;, a detailed history of the record production career of the Philadelphia-born guitarist and producer. The book featured interviews with Rundgren and many of his production clients, including Patti Smith, XTC, Meat Loaf, New York Dolls, Cheap Trick, Psychedelic Furs, Grand Funk, and Hall &amp; Oates. The book was critically acclaimed and received four star reviews from the British magazines &quot;MOJO&quot; and &quot;Record Collector&quot;.

In 2014, Myers continued to write, record and play sporadic shows, appearing since 2014 as The Paul &amp; John, a San Francisco-based duo formed by Myers and John Moremen, performing with drummers that have included D. J. Bonebrake and Dawn Richardson.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastcompany.com/user/paul-myers&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Paul &amp; John have released one album, &quot;Inner Sunset&quot; (2014). Kickstarter was used to fund upfront costs of a vinyl pressing.

In 2018, On 23 October 2018, House of Anansi Press published Myers&#x27; 4th book, &quot;Kids In the Hall: One Dumb Guy.&quot; The book&#x27;s release was preceded and followed by a promotional speaking tour discussing the history of the comedy troupe, Kids in the Hall, featuring some members of the cast. On 21 September 2018, Myers was joined at the Crows Nest Theatre in Toronto by Bruce McCulloch and Scott Thompson as part of the Toronto Sketch Comedy Festival. In January 2019, Myers was joined in conversation about the book by 4 of the 5 Kids in the Hall: Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Mark McKinney and Scott Thompson at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco as part of Sketchfest 2019.

<text>The SIAI-Marchetti S.211 (later Aermacchi S-211) is a turbofan-powered military trainer aircraft designed and originally marketed by Italian aviation manufacturer SIAI-Marchetti.

SIAI-Marchetti started to develop the S-211 in 1976 as a private venture initiative, announcing its existence during the following year. In April 1981, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. The Singapore Air Force placed the first order for ten aircraft in 1983. Some 60 aircraft have been sold to air forces around the world. Following Aermacchi&#x27;s purchase of SIAI-Marchetti in 1997, the former has held the production rights to the type. An extensively redesigned and modernised derivative, the Aermacchi M-345, has been developed by Alenia Aermacchi, and entered service in 2020.

==Development==
In 1976, Italian aircraft company SIAI-Marchetti began work on what would become the S-211. The project was undertaken as a private venture to develop a new basic trainer aircraft. SIAI-Marchetti planned to offer the type to the company&#x27;s existing customer base, consisting of various air forces around the world that operated their SF.260, a piston-engined trainer. The programme&#x27;s existence was announced in Paris in 1977. Reportedly, customer interest was strong enough to justify the construction of two prototypes, the first of which flew on 10 April 1981. In 1983, the Singapore Air Force placed the first order for the S-211, for ten aircraft.

The S-211A was a slightly modified and updated variant of the S-211, was a losing contender in the United States Air Force&#x27;s Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) aircraft selection. Among the seven aircraft to enter, the Raytheon/Pilatus entry emerged as the winner, being produced as the T-6 Texan II. The S-211 team was initially partnered with American aircraft company Grumman. Following its merger with Northrop Corporation in 1994, SIAI-Marchetti worked with Northrop Grumman on the S-211A up until the selection.

In 1997, rival Italian aviation firm Aermacchi acquired SIAI-Marchetti and thereby the S-211. According to Aermacchi, the acquisition would enable significant cost savings in production following consolidation to its Venegono Inferiore facility. Aermacchi has continued to seek customers for the type. In 2004, the company announced its intention to develop an improved version of the S-211, then referred to as the S-311, later as the M-345. At the time, Aermacchi was also developing the M-346 Master, which serves as a lead-in fighter trainer. While vaguely similar to the M-211, the M-346 is considerably larger and intended to perform both the basic and advanced training syllabus, as well tactical training functions, as an alternative to single-engined turboprop-powered competitors.

==Design==
The S-211 is a compact two-seat shoulder-wing monoplane, possessing a full aerobatic capability. It is furnished with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada JT15D-4C turbofan powerplant. The S-211 has been principally used as a basic trainer aircraft, the student and instructor being seated in a tandem arrangement. The front and rear cockpits are fully duplicated, the latter being elevated above the former to provide the occupant with improved forward visibility. The aircraft was designed to perform a secondary close air support (CAS) capability, being equipped with four underwing hard points, facilitating the carriage of various armaments and other external stores, including sensor apparatus and photographic equipment for undertaking aerial reconnaissance missions. Some models feature an additional hard point on the underside of the fuselage.

The airframe is largely composed of several composite materials, which includes Kevlar, Nomex and carbon fibre, while extensive use of structural bonding was made during construction. The flight controls feature manually operated push-pull rod primary controls. Many other systems, such as the air brake, landing gear, compressor, and boosted ailerons, are hydraulically-actuated at a nominal operating pressure of 200 bar (3,000 psi).

The electrical system consists of a 28V DC supply, powered by an engine-driven generator, an AC supply for instruments and avionics is provided via a pair of inverters. To facilitate engine start-up and accommodate emergency situations, the aircraft is outfitted with a nickel-cadmium battery unit. For greater crew comfort, an automatically adjusting environmental control system is installed. It uses a non-ozone-depleting vapour cycle for cooling, which is combined with bleed air drawn from the engine for heat and pressurisation alike.
The avionics of the S-211 were designed to be customisable, allowing the manufacturer to accommodate a customer&#x27;s various mission requirements. In a typical configuration, the aircraft would be provided a VHF/UHF communications suite, multiple navigation systems, such as an attitude and heading reference system (AHRS), horizontal situation indicator, automatic direction finding (ADF), VHF omnidirectional range and instrument landing system (VOR-ILS), a tactical air navigation system (TACAN) and identification friend or foe (IFF) transponder. Operators can choose to have their S-211s outfitted with modern glass cockpits.

The S-211&#x27;s single JTI5D-4C engine provides a maximum thrust output of 11.12 kN (2,500 lbs) and a specific fuel consumption of 0.57 lb/h/lb. This powerplant facilitates a maximum speed of 414 knots at 25,000 ft and a rate of climb of 5,100 ft per minute. Fuel is housed internally within both the integral wing tank and a bladder cell within the fuselage, accommodating a combined 955 L (210 U.S. gal). For greater range, a maximum of two drop tanks can be installed upon the inner hard points of the wing, each having a capacity of 323 L (71 U.S. gal). Fuel is transferred between the various tanks and to the engine via a double-ended turbine pump. Ground refuelling involves a single fill point present on the wing, which is fed either by gravity flow or by an optionally installed pressurised refuelling system.

==Operational history==
Since the 1990s, the Philippine Air Force (PAF) has been using its S-211 fleet both as a trainer and in offensive operations via secondary attack capability. These were redesignated as AS-211s and nicknamed as &quot;Warriors&quot;. Following the retirement of the PAF&#x27;s last Northrop F-5 fighters in 2005, the additional task of air defense has been assigned to its AS-211s. Because of this, the PAF initiated some improvements to the AS-211s to improve its combat capability through a series of programs and innovations.

The first program was called &quot;Project Falcon&quot;, which installed the Norsight Optical Sight previously fitted to withdrawn F-5s into the AS-211. The program was initiated by Lieutenant Colonel Enrique Dela Cruz, the Group Commander of the 5th Tactical Fighter Group. This was followed by the &quot;Project Falcon Uniform&quot; program, which repainted the aircraft with a 2-tone light-and-dark ghost gray paint scheme along with low visibility markings, which reduces the aircraft&#x27;s overall visibility.

The &quot;Project Falcon Hear&quot; program involved the optimizing of air-ground communications on the AS-211 by upgrading and installing the AN/ARC-34 UHF radios from the F-5A/B. These aircraft were fitted with a belly-mounted gun pod, which was designed, developed and manufactured by Philippine company Aerotech Industries Philippines, Inc. (AIPI). Each gun pod is equipped with an M3 .50 cal machine gun, an automatic charger and approximately 240 rounds of .50 cal ammunition.

In July 2022, the remaining S-211s are being used for training as the FA-50s are brought into service.

==Variants==
;S-211: Original production version with total of approximately sixty built. Was operated by the air forces of Haiti, Philippines and Singapore.
;S-211A: Proposed version developed with input from Grumman for the JPATS (two prototypes, converted from two former Haitian S-211 aircraft).
;AS-211: Served as trainers with secondary combat capability with the Philippine Air Force and were nicknamed as &quot;Warriors&quot;. Starting in 2005, these aircraft were upgraded by fitting the Norsight Optical Sight and AN/ARC-34s from retired F-5s. It is also equipped with a .50 caliber belly gun pod made by Aerotech.
;M-311: Modernized and uprated version announced by Aermacchi in 2004 (two prototypes built).

<doc id="943833" wikidata="Q1978681" url="?curid=943833" title="Ritual washing in Judaism">
<text>In Judaism, ritual washing, or ablution, takes two main forms. Tevilah () is a full body immersion in a mikveh, and netilat yadayim is the washing of the hands with a cup (see Handwashing in Judaism).

References to ritual washing are found in the Hebrew Bible, and are elaborated in the Mishnah and Talmud. They have been codified in various codes of Jewish law and tradition, such as Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (12th century) and Joseph Karo&#x27;s &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (16th century). These practices are most commonly observed within Orthodox Judaism. In Conservative Judaism, the practices are normative, with certain leniencies and exceptions. Ritual washing is not generally performed in Reform Judaism.

== Hebrew Bible ==
The Hebrew Bible requires immersion of the body in water as a means of purification in several circumstances, for example:
: And when the &quot;zav&quot; is cleansed of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean.

There are also references to hand-washing:
: And whoever the &quot;zav&quot; touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

: I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD.

Priests were required to wash their hands and feet before service in the Temple:
:Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat; when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to cause an offering made by fire to smoke unto the LORD.

== Washing the hands ==
According to halakha or custom, the hands are washed on a number of occasions. These include before and after eating a meal with bread; upon awaking in the morning; after using the toilet; before eating karpas in the Passover seder; and before prayer. On some of these occasions, the water must be poured from a cup; on others, it may also be delivered by any means such as a faucet. On some of these occasions, a blessing is recited; on others, it is not.

== Full-body immersion (&quot;Tevilah&quot;) ==
There are several occasions on which biblical or rabbinical regulations require immersion of the whole body, referred to as tevilah. 
For example, the impurity of zav is unique in that it cannot be purified by immersion in a normal mikveh, but rather requires immersion in a spring of running water (&quot;mayim hayim&quot;).

Depending on the circumstances, such ritual bathing might require immersion in &quot;living water&quot;—either by using a natural stream or by using a mikveh (a specially constructed ritual bath, connected directly to a natural source of water, such as a spring).

This article discusses the requirements of immersion in Rabbinic Judaism and its descendants. Some other branches of Judaism, such as Haymanot Judaism, have substantially different practices including the requirement of an actual spring or stream.

=== Current practice ===
Occasions on which full-body immersion is currently practiced include:
* After a woman&#x27;s &quot;niddah&quot; period concludes following menstruation or other uterine bleeding, she must immerse and only then is permitted to resume sexual relations with her husband. This practice remains the principal use of contemporary mikvehs. It is fully observed in Orthodox Judaism, and normative in Conservative Judaism. 
* Some Orthodox men immerse after having a seminal discharge (&quot;keri&quot;).
* In Orthodox Judaism, there is a widespread minhag for men, to immerse themselves on the day prior to Yom Kippur, and many do so before the three pilgrimage festivals and before Rosh Hashanah. Many also immerse themselves before the Shabbat, and many (primarily Hasidic Jews) do so daily before morning prayers.
* A convert to Judaism must immerse.
* &quot;Taharah&quot;, (&quot;Purification&quot;), the ritual washing and cleansing, and immersion in a mikveh according to many customs, of a Jew&#x27;s body prior to burial
* Prior to ascending the Temple Mount (by those Orthodox or Masorti authorities who permit ascending the Temple Mount)

=== Past practice ===

==== Bodily fluids and skin conditions ====

The Torah prescribes rituals addressing the skin condition known as &quot;tzaraath&quot; and unusual genital discharges in a man or woman (Zav/Zavah), which required special sacrifices and rituals in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem including immersion in a mikveh. 

The practice of checking for &quot;tzaraath&quot; fell out of use with the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the end of sacrificial rites. However, each of the other requirements remains in effect to some extent in Orthodox Judaism and (to a lesser degree) in Conservative Judaism.

==== &quot;Zavah&quot; ====
A woman experiencing uterine blood, not part of normal menstruation, was classified as a &quot;zavah&quot; in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem and remained in a state of ritual impurity for seven days before immersion. Today, the law of &quot;zavah&quot; remains in effect in Orthodox Judaism, in two respects. Due to extreme conditions in Roman Palestine in the time of the Amoraim, women&#x27;s periods became irregular, and women became unable to determine whether or not their discharges were regular (&quot;niddah&quot;) or irregular (&quot;zavah&quot;). As a result, women adapted a stringency combining the &quot;niddah&quot; and &quot;zavah&quot; periods, refraining from intercourse and physical contact with their husbands for seven days of the &quot;zavah&quot; period following menstruation, for a total of approximately 12 days per month, which Orthodox women continue to observe today. The laws of &quot;zavah&quot; are also applied, as in Biblical times, to uterine blood discharges outside regular menstruation. Such circumstances are often interpreted leniently, however, and rabbinic stratagems have been devised to lessen their severity. Women experiencing irregularities (droplets) are sometimes advised to wear coloured underwear to mitigate the detectability of evidence of &quot;zavah&quot; status and hence a need to determine that a woman is a &quot;zavah&quot;.

==== &quot;Keri&quot; ====

Men experiencing a seminal discharge, including through regular marital intercourse, were prohibited from entering the Temple in Jerusalem and required to immerse in a mikveh, remaining ritually impure until the evening. The Talmud ascribes to the Great Assembly of Ezra a Rabbinic decree imposing further restrictions on men ritually impure from a seminal discharge, including a prohibition on studying Torah and from participating in services.

Maimonides wrote a responsum lifting the decree of Ezra, based on an opinion in the Talmud stating that it had failed to be observed by a majority of the community and the Jewish people found themselves unable to sustain it. However, Maimonides continued to follow the &quot;Keri&quot; restrictions as a matter of personal observance. Since then, observance of the rules of &quot;Keri&quot; and hence regular mikveh use by men fell into disuse in many communities. Hasidic Judaism, however, revived the practice of regular mikveh use, advocating regular daily mikveh use as a way of achieving spiritual purity. The growth of Hasidic Judaism resulted in a revival of mikveh use by men. In addition, some Sephardic and Mizrahi communities continued to observe the rules of &quot;keri&quot; throughout.

==== Contact with an animal carcass ====

According to Leviticus, anyone who comes into contact with or carries any creature that had not been deliberately killed by &quot;shechita&quot; was regarded by the biblical regulations as having made themselves unclean by doing so, and therefore was compelled to immerse their entire body. This regulation is immediately preceded by the rule against eating anything still containing blood, and according to biblical scholars this is also the context of the regulation about not eating non-sacrifices—that the regulation only treats such consumption as unclean if there is a risk of blood remaining within the carcass. In the version of this regulation in Deuteronomy, eating the bodies of such creatures is not described as making an individual ritually impure, nor requires the eater to wash their body, but instead, such consumption is expressly forbidden, although the creature is allowed to be passed on to a non-Jew, who is permitted to eat it.

==== Contact with a corpse ====

Anyone who came into contact with a human corpse, or grave, was so ritually impure that they had to be sprinkled with the water produced from the red heifer ritual, in order to become ritually pure again; however, the person who carried out the red heifer ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so. According to Cheyne and Black, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in Deuteronomy for a group of people to atone for murder by an unknown perpetrator, according to which a heifer is killed at a stream, and hands are washed over it; Peake believed that these are both ultimately cases of sympathetic magic, and similar rituals existed in Greek and Roman mythology. The masoretic text describes the water produced from the red heifer ritual as a sin offering; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings by not being killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to understand the meaning of sin offerings.

==== Treatment of a corpse ====
No explicit regulations are expressed in the bible concerning the treatment of a corpse itself, although historic rabbinical sources saw an implication that the dead should be thoroughly washed per Ecclesiastes, as children are washed when born; according to Raavyah, a prominent &quot;rishon&quot;, argued that the corpse should be cleansed carefully, including the ears and fingers, with nails pared and hair combed, so that the corpse could be laid to rest in the manner that the person had visited the synagogue during life. Washing of corpses was not observed among the Jews living in Persian Babylon, for which they were criticised as dying &quot;in filth, without a candle and without a bath&quot;; at the time, the non-Jewish Persians were predominantly Zoroastrian, and consequently believed that dead bodies were inherently ritually unclean, and should be exposed to the elements in a Tower of Silence to avoid defiling the earth with them.

In the early periods, the body was washed in a standard mikveh, and this is frequently the form of the ritual in the present day, but the traditional washing ceremony, known as &quot;tahara&quot;, became quite detailed over time. A special building for the corpse-washing existed in the cemetery in 15th century Prague, a practice which obtains in many Jewish communities today; a mikveh is provided at a number of ancient tombs. Female corpses are traditionally cleaned only by other females, and males only by other males.

Between death and the traditional ceremony, the body is placed on the ground, and covered with a sheet, and at the start of the traditional ceremony, the body is lifted from the ground onto a special board or slab (a &quot;tahara board&quot;), so that it lies facing the door, with a white sheet underneath. The clothes are then removed from the corpse (if they were not removed when the corpse was placed on the ground), and at this point is recited by the enactors of the ritual, as it refers to the removal of filthy clothes. Following this, the body is thoroughly rubbed with lukewarm water, with the mouth of the corpse covered so that water does not enter it; the next part of the ritual is the pouring of water over the head, while is quoted, since it refers to the sprinkling of water to produce cleanness; and then each limb is washed downwards, while and the following verses, which describe the beauty of elements of the body, are spoken. Finally, nine measures of cold water are poured over the body while it is upright, which is the core element of the ceremony, and it is then dried (according to some customs), and enshrouded; in ancient times the hair and nails were also cut, but by the 19th century, the hair was merely combed, and the nails were just cleansed with a special pin, unless their length is excessive. After the ceremony, the &quot;taharah board&quot; is washed and dried, but is kept facing the same way, as there is the belief that turning it the other way will cause another person to die within three days. Many communities have replaced the pouring of nine measures by immersion in a specially constructed mikveh.

A more elaborate ceremony, known as the &quot;grand washing&quot; (, ), is available for the corpses of the more significant individuals; Hillel the Elder is traditionally credited with its invention. According to this latter form of ceremony, the water used for washing was perfumed by rose, myrtle, or aromatic spices; the use of spices was an ancient practice, and the Mishnah especially mentions the washing ceremonies using myrtle.

==== Yom Kippur ====

The biblical regulations of Yom Kippur require the officiating Jewish High Priest to bathe himself in water after sending off the scapegoat to Azazel, and a similar requirement was imposed on the person who led the scapegoat away, and the person who burned the sacrifices during the rituals of the day. The Mishnah states that the High Priest had to immerse himself five times, and his hands and feet had to be washed ten times.

== Reason for contemporary observance ==

Both Orthodox and Conservative Judaism currently have multiple views on the reason for contemporary observance of ritual washing and immersion obligation.

In Orthodox Judaism, opinion is generally split between a view that maintains that those Biblical rules related to ritual purity that are possible to observe in the absence of a Temple and a red heifer remain in force, and Jews remain Biblically-obligated to observe such of them as they can, and a view that Biblical ritual impurity requirements apply only in the presence of a Temple in Jerusalem, and the current rules represent only rabbinic ordinances, practices decreed by the Rabbis in memory of the Temple.

In December 2006, Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards issued three responses on the subject of Niddah. All three ruled the traditional requirements of ritual washing remained in effect for Conservative Jews (with some leniencies and liberalization of interpretation), but disagreed on the reasoning for continuing this practices, as well as on the validity of specific leniencies. Two of the opinions reflect reasoning similar to the respective Orthodox views (Biblical requirements or rabbinic ordinances enacted in remembrance of the Temple.) A third opinion expressed the view that Conservative Judaism should disconnect ritual purity practices from the Temple in Jerusalem or its memory, and offered a new approach based on what it called the concept of holiness, rather than the concept of purity. Thus, Conservative Judaism, under its philosophy of pluralism, supports a range of views on this subject, from views similar to the Orthodox view to views expressing a need for a contemporary re-orientation.

== History and commentary ==

Both traditional religious and secular scholars agree that ritual washing in Judaism was derived by the Rabbis of the Talmud from a more extensive set of ritual washing and purity practices in use in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, based on various verses in the Hebrew Scriptures and received traditions. There is disagreement, however, about the origins and meanings of these practices.

Philo of Alexandria refers to ritual washing in the context of the Temple and Leviticus, but also speaks of spiritual &quot;washing&quot;. At Qumran, basins which served as baths have been identified, and among the Dead Sea scrolls, texts on maintaining ritual purity reflect the requirements of Leviticus.

According to the editors of the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, the phrase &quot;netilat yadaim&quot; referring to washing of the hands, literally &quot;lifting of the hands&quot;, is derived either from Psalm 134:2, or from the Greek word &quot;natla&quot; (αντλίον in Hebrew ), in reference to the jar of water used. The Jewish Encyclopedia states that many historic Jewish writers, and particularly the Pharisees, took it to mean that water had to be poured out onto uplifted hands, and that they could not be considered clean until water had reached the wrist. The Christian New Testament states that in Jesus&#x27; time, &quot;Pharisees, and all the Jews&quot; would not eat until they had washed their hands to the wrist, and it was noteworthy that Jesus and his followers did not wash.

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, the historic requirement for priests to first wash their hands, together with the classical rabbinical belief that non-priest were also required to wash their hands before taking part in a holy act, such as prayer, was adhered to very strongly, to the extent that Christianity adopted the practice, and provided worshippers with fountains and basins of water in Churches, in a similar manner to the &quot;Molten Sea&quot; in the Jerusalem Temple functioning as a laver. Although Christianity did not adopt the requirement for priests to wash feet before worship, in Islam the practice was extended to the congregation and expanded into wudu.

According to Peake&#x27;s Commentary on the Bible, Biblical scholars regard the requirement of Kohanim washing their hands before the Priestly Blessing as an example of the taboo against the profane making contact with the sacred, and similar practices are present in other religions of the period and region. The Jewish Encyclopedia relates that according to Herodotus the Egyptian priests were required to wash themselves twice a day and twice a night in cold water, and according to Hesiod the Greeks were forbidden from pouring out the &quot;black wine&quot; to any deity in the morning, unless they had first washed their hands.

According to the 1906 Jewish encyclopedia, The Letter of Aristeas states that creators of the Septuagint washed their hands in the sea each morning before prayer; Josephus states that this custom was the reason for the traditional location of synagogues near water.
Biblical scholars regard this custom as an imitation by the laity of the behaviour of the priests. A baraita offers, as justification for the ritual of hand-washing after waking, the belief that a spirit of impurity rests upon each person during the night, and will not leave until the person&#x27;s hands are washed, and the Zohar argues that body is open to demonic possession during sleep because the soul temporarily leaves the body during it; the kabbalah argues that death awaits anyone who walks more than four yards from their bed without ablution. According to , the cup containing the water has to be able to carry a certain amount of water, and it should have two handles.

According to Peake&#x27;s commentary on the Bible, the Priestly Code specifies that individuals were &quot;washed&quot; before they could become members of the Jewish priesthood, and similarly requires Levites to be &quot;cleansed&quot; before they assume their work.
Peake&#x27;s commentary states that although Biblical rules regarding ritual purification following bodily discharges clearly have sanitary uses, they ultimately originated from the taboos against contact with blood and semen, due to the belief that these contained life, more than any other bodily fluid, or any other aspect of the body.

Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in &quot;Waters of Life&quot; connects the laws of impurity to the narrative in the beginning of Genesis. According to Genesis, Adam and Eve had brought death into the world by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. Kaplan points out that most of the laws of impurity relate to some form of death (or in the case of &quot;niddah&quot; the loss of a potential life). One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin).

==Mikveh in symbolic experience and biblical typology==
Immersing in a mikveh can be a symbolic act connecting a person to ancestral experiences.

<text>Felice Cavallotti (6 November 1842 – 6 March 1898) was an Italian politician, poet and dramatic author.

==Biography==

=== Early career ===
Born in Milan, Cavallotti fought with the Garibaldian Corps in their 1860 and 1866 campaigns during the Italian Wars of Independence.

Following his military service he created a series of anti-monarchical lampoons in the &quot;Gazzetta di Milano&quot; and in the &quot;Gazzettina Rosa&quot; between 1866 and 1872. He also commented Garibaldi&#x27;s deeds in the Neapolitan &quot;Indipendente&quot;, directed by Alexandre Dumas, père.

=== Political career ===
In 1872 Cavallotti was elected to the Italian Parliament as deputy for Corteolona. When sworn in Cavallotti took the oath of allegiance, despite having lampooned the oath in his articles. Eloquent and turbulent, his combativeness in and out of Parliament secured for him the leadership of the Extreme Left on the death of Agostino Bertani in 1886. During his twelve years&#x27; leadership, his party increased in number from twenty to seventy, and at the time of his death his parliamentary influence was greater than ever before.

Although he was ambitious and used defamatory methods of personal attack, Cavallotti&#x27;s eloquent advocacy of democratic reform and apparent generosity of sentiment secured for him a popularity surpassed by that of no Italian political contemporary except Francesco Crispi.

Services rendered in the cholera epidemic of 1885, his numerous lawsuits and thirty-three duels, his bitter campaign against Crispi, and his championship of French interests combined to enhance his notoriety and to increase his political influence. By skillful alliances with the Marquis Antonio di Rudinì he more than once obtained practical control of the Italian government and exacted notable concessions to Radical demands.

In 1889 he contributed to the erection of the statue of Giordano Bruno in Campo de&#x27; Fiori at Rome, a symbol of the lay struggle against the unceasing encroachment of the Holy See in Italian politics.

=== Death===
Aged 55, Cavallotti was killed in a duel against Count Ferruccio Macola, editor of the conservative &quot;Gazzetta di Venezia&quot;, whom he had insulted. Poet and Freemason Giosuè Carducci issued a celebrative discourse for his death. Cavallotti was buried in the cemetery of Dagnente, on the Lake Maggiore.

However, Felice Cavallotti denied being a member of the Italian Freemasonry in a letter addressed on 9 January 1875 to the director of the journal &quot;Italia Reale&quot;. With the permission of his political opponent Francesco Crispi, Cavallotti contributed to the erection of the monument commemorating Giordano Bruno in Rome, place Campo de&#x27; Fiori, a work of the sculptor Ettore Ferrari which was Grand Master of the Grand Orient of Italy.

<text>Estonia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s ninth appearance at the Summer Olympics.

The Estonian Olympic Committee sent a total of 42 athletes, 31 men and 11 women, competing only in 11 different sports. Sixteen athletes had competed in Sydney, including three Olympic medalists: decathlon champion Erki Nool, and judoka and bronze medalists Aleksei Budõlin and Indrek Pertelson. Rower Jüri Jaanson participated in his fifth Olympics under two different banners (the other one with the Soviet Union) as the most experienced member of the contingent. Discus thrower Eha Rünne, aged 41, was the oldest athlete of the team, while long-distance freestyle swimmer Jelena Petrova was the youngest at age 15. Claiming the nation&#x27;s first ever gold medal in athletics, Nool was appointed by the Estonian Olympic Committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Estonia left Athens with the same number of medals (3) collected from the previous games, but failed to earn a single gold. After finishing farther from the podium in four consecutive Olympics, Jaanson ended his medal drought by taking home the silver in the men&#x27;s single sculls. Two bronze medals were awarded to discus thrower Aleksander Tammert and heavyweight judoka Indrek Pertelson, who managed to repeat it from Sydney.

<text>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) was an aircraft procurement program of the United States in the 1990s by the United States Air Force and United States Navy, a merger of 1980s era training aircraft programs. The winner was declared in 1995 and entered service a few years later as the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II. The program was partly a result of the cancelled Fairchild T-46 of the 1980s.

In 1995, the selection of Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita, Kansas, to develop and deliver the JPATS was made. The aircraft would be manufactured by Raytheon, Beechcraft&#x27;s parent company, starting in the late 1990s and into the early 21st century. The companies that initially responded and competed were Vought, Northrop, Grumman, Rockwell, Beechcraft, Lockheed, and Cessna. However, by the time the selection was over, Northrop, Grumman, and Vought were all part of the same larger company. Over 700 JPATS are intended to be bought over time.

==History==

In 1988, the United States Navy (USN) and the United States Air Force (USAF) were at a unique moment in history; they reached a point where they could work together, and provide a cost-effective solution to pilot production, specifically primary training. Both services needed to modernize their fleets of training aircraft.

The USAF and the USN cleared the first major obstacle on the subject of commonality. Each service preferred a different seating configuration. The USAF preferred the side-by-side configuration, while the USN preferred the tandem configuration. These preferences may have been due to each service&#x27;s previous experience in training aircraft. The T-37 is a side-by-side configuration, while the T-34C is a tandem arrangement. The hurdle was cleared when both services agreed on the tandem configuration.

The JPATS selection process began on 18 May 1994, when the RFP was issued. Seven contractors responded to the JPATS RFP:

* Beechcraft, part of Raytheon at that time
* Cessna
* Grumman, merged with Northrop in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman
* Lockheed, merged with Martin Marietta in 1995 to form Lockheed Martin
* Northrop Corporation, merged with Grumman in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman
* Rockwell (worked with MBB/DASA for JPATS)
* Vought, originally part of LTV, bought by Northrop in 1994

The process took fourteen months and entailed evaluations of seven aircraft, seven cockpit mockups, and thousands of pages of contractor proposals.

Beechcraft/Raytheon, with a modified Swiss Pilatus PC-9 Mk 2 aircraft, was awarded the prime contract on 22 June 1995. The contract contained a nine-year period of performance through FY2004, and a production run continuing through FY2017. Concurrent with the contract award, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) was also provided the GBTS Request for Contract Change Proposal (CCP).

It was designated under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, skipping some numbers use the same designation as the older North American T-6 Texan which, while also used under the post-1962 system, had been originally designated in an older system.

==Contenders==
The seven main Contenders included:
* Beech-Pilatus PC-9 Mk 2, which won the competition; produced as the T-6 Texan II
*Cessna 526 CitationJet
*Lockheed T-Bird II, partnered with Aermachhi based on the Aermacchi MB-339
* Northrop Super Tucano EMB-312H – an improved EMB-312 Tucano with uprated engine and other improvements.
* Grumman S.211A a modified SIAI Marchetti S.211.
* Rockwell Ranger 2000 based on the RFB Fantrainer.
* Vought Pampa 2000 – a modified FMA IA 63

<text>Lynda Suzanne Robinson (born July 6, 1951) is an American writer of romance fiction under the name Suzanne Robinson and mystery novels under the name Lynda S. Robinson. She is best known for her Lord Meren series of historical mysteries set in Ancient Egypt during the reign of Tutankhamun.

==Biography==
Lynda Suzanne Heavener was born in Amarillo, Texas to George H. Measley Heavener and Lois Ann Womack Heavener. She received an associate degree from San Jacinto College in 1971 and her undergraduate degree in 1973 from Rice University. The same year she married Wessley I. Robinson, who worked as a school administrator.

In 1984 Robinson earned a Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Texas at Austin with a specialization in archaeology. While working on her dissertation, Robinson realized she didn&#x27;t want to work in academia. Her husband suggested she try writing fiction, which she did.

Robinson lives in Texas in the south central hill country with her husband.

== Writing career ==
Robinson publishes her fiction under different variations of her name. As Suzanne Robinson, she has written twelve historical romances of various settings and time periods ranging from ancient Egypt to the Elizabethan and Victorian periods. Robinson&#x27;s first published novel, &quot;Heart of the Falcon&quot;, was a historical romance set in ancient Egypt with a heavy dose of suspense and mystery.

As Lynda S. Robinson, she is the author of critically acclaimed Lord Meren series of mysteries set in ancient Egypt. Lord Meren is King Tutankhamen&#x27;s chief investigator and trusted advisor. The books focus on political intrigue such as plots against the pharaoh and also feature Queen Nefertiti. The first book in the series, &quot;Murder in the Place of Anubis&quot;, was published in 1994 and received a starred review from Publishers Weekly along with praise from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; and other media outlets.

== Critical reception ==

According to the &quot;Guide to Literary Masters &amp; Their Works&quot;, Robinson&#x27;s novels are known for &quot;painstaking historical research, insight into human relationships, an understanding of political intrigue, and a gift for inventing suspenseful plots.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Marilyn Stasio praised the Lord Meren series as &quot;fascinating,&quot; saying Robinson uses &quot;her scholarship to penetrate the inner precincts of court and temple, she has written a complex and exciting narrative that reflects the twisted machinations of politicians -- royal and otherwise.&quot;

<doc id="943876" wikidata="Q454951" url="?curid=943876" title="Míriam Colón">
<text>Míriam Colón Valle (August 20, 1936 – March 3, 2017) was a Puerto Rican actress. She was the founder and director of New York City&#x27;s Puerto Rican Traveling Theater. Beginning her career in the early 1950s, she performed on Broadway and on television. She appeared on television programs from the 1960s to the 2010s, including &quot;Sanford and Son&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. She is best known as Mama Montana, the mother of Al Pacino&#x27;s title character in &quot;Scarface&quot;. In 2014, she received the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama. She died of complications from a pulmonary infection on March 3, 2017, at the age of 80.

==Early life==
Míriam Colón Valle was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on August 20, 1936. In the 1940s, her recently divorced mother moved the family to a public housing project called Residencial Las Casas in San Juan. She attended Román Baldorioty de Castro High School in Old San Juan, where she took part in plays. Her first drama teacher, Marcos Colón (no relation) believed in her talent, and helped her gain permission to observe the students in the drama department of the University of Puerto Rico. She was a good student in high school and was awarded scholarships to the Dramatic Workshop and Technical Institute and Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Actors Studio in New York City.

In New York, she befriended Dean Zayas, another young Puerto Rican actor and future director.

==Career==

In 1953, Colón debuted as an actress in &quot;Los Peloteros&quot; (&quot;The Baseball Players&quot;), a film produced in Puerto Rico, starring Ramón &quot;Diplo&quot; Rivero, and in which she played a character called Lolita. That year, she moved to New York City, where she was accepted by Actors Studio co-founder Elia Kazan after a single audition, thus becoming the studio&#x27;s first Puerto Rican member. In New York, she worked in theater and later landed a role on the soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. She attended a performance of René Marqués&#x27; &quot;La Carreta&quot; (&quot;The Oxcart&quot;) which motivated her to form the first Hispanic theater group, with the help of La Carreta&#x27;s producer, Roberto Rodríguez, called &quot;El Nuevo Círculo Dramatico&quot;.

In 1954, she appeared on stage in &quot;In The Summer House&quot; at the Play House in New York City. Between 1954 and 1974, she made guest appearances in television shows such as &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. She appeared mostly in westerns such as &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;, and &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;. She appeared in the 1961 film &quot;One-eyed Jacks&quot; as &quot;the Redhead&quot;. In 1962, she was featured as the co-star in a teleplay written by Frank Gabrielsen, and produced for the TV series &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot;. The title of the hour-long episode is &quot;The Richest Man in Bogota&quot;, airing on 17 June 1962. It starred Lee Marvin as Juan de Núñez, and Miriam Colón as &quot;Marina&quot; (not Medina-Saroté, as in the original H.G. Wells story, &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot;). She co-starred as Anita Chavez in &quot;Thunder Island&quot; (1963), with the screenplay written by Jack Nicholson. In 1963, she guest starred on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, playing a Comanche woman who marries a settler and the two must deal with the racial hatred of others due to it in the episode “Shona” (S8E22).

In 1979, she starred alongside fellow Puerto Rican actors José Ferrer, Raúl Juliá, and Henry Darrow in &quot;Life of Sin&quot;, a film in which she portrayed Isabel la Negra, a real-life Puerto Rican brothel owner. In 1983, she was cast as the mother of Tony Montana in &quot;Scarface&quot;, despite being only 4 years older than Al Pacino. Colón has said that she based her performance on her own mother. She was also cast as María in the 1999 film &quot;Gloria&quot;, starring Sharon Stone. In 2013, she was cast in the role of Ultima, a New Mexico Hispanic healer, in the movie &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; based on the novel by Rudolfo Anaya. She appeared in Season 1 of the TV series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; in 2015, as Abuelita.

==Puerto Rican Traveling Theater==
In the late 1960s, Colón founded The Puerto Rican Traveling Theater company on West 47th street in Manhattan, New York. The company presents Off-Broadway productions onsite and also goes on tour. She was the director of the company and she appeared in the following PRTT productions:
* &quot;The Ox Cart&quot; (1966–1967)
* &quot;The Boiler Room&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Simpson Street&quot;
* &quot;Señora Carrar&#x27;s Rifles&quot;

The play &quot;The Ox Cart&quot; (&quot;La Carreta&quot;), written by Puerto Rican dramatist René Marqués, was first produced in 1953. It was directed by Roberto Rodríguez and starred Colón. The success of the play allowed Rodríguez and Colón to form the first permanent Hispanic theatrical group, and for the group to have its own space, Teatro Arena, located in Manhattan on Sixth Avenue between 43rd and 44th street.

==Recognition==

In 1993, Colón received an Obie Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theater. In 2000, she received the HOLA Raúl Juliá Founders Award, presented by the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors (HOLA).

Colón&#x27;s biography, &quot;Míriam Colón: Actor and Theater Founder&quot;, was written by Mayra Fernandez in 1994.

In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded Colón the National Medal of Arts for her contributions as an actress. The citation reads as follows: &quot;Ms. Colón has been a trailblazer in film, television, and theater, and helped open doors for generations of Hispanic actors.&quot;

==Personal life==
Colón was married to George Paul Edgar from 1966 until his death in 1976. In 1987, she married Fred Valle.

She was an avid collector of ancestral arts including pre-Colombian, tribal African, historic Native American, and other tribal art. She collected Mid-East artifacts, abstract paintings, and modern sculpture. A Pablo Picasso sketch she owned, she signed with a crayon, and it was auctioned for $6500 on June 16, 2019. At her death, she owned at least six signed movie posters of Al Pacino&#x27;s &quot;Scarface&quot; and at least seven signed &quot;Scarface&quot; soundtrack albums.

Her final years were in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

==Death==
Colón died on March 3, 2017, at the age of 80, in New York City of complications from a pulmonary infection. Among those who paid tribute to her were Rosalba Rolón, Marc Anthony (who she had coached as an actor and briefly appeared with on television), and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

<doc id="943877" wikidata="Q3429155" url="?curid=943877" title="Rick O'Shay">
<text>Rick O&#x27;Shay is a Western comic strip created by Stan Lynde, which debuted as a Sunday strip on April 27, 1958. The daily comic strip began on May 19 of the same year. It was distributed worldwide through the Chicago Tribune Syndicate. The final &quot;Rick O&#x27;Shay&quot; comic strips written and drawn by Lynde were the daily for 7 May 1977 and the Sunday for July 17, 1977. He left the syndicate after a disagreement. As the syndicate owned the rights to the strip, the popular &quot;Rick O&#x27;Shay&quot; comic strip was continued by others: Marian Dern (writer) and Alfredo Alcala and Mel Keefer (artists). Publication ended on March 8, 1981.

==Characters and story==
The strip is set in the Western town of Conniption, where Rick O&#x27;Shay is the marshal. His best friend is gunslinger Hipshot Percussion. Other key characters include gambler Deuces Wilde, dance-hall owner Gaye Abandon, physician Dr. Basil Metabolism (and his nurse, Ophelia Pulse), gunsmith and Civil War veteran Cap&#x27;n Ball, banker Mort Gage, barber Dan Druff, cafe owner Hominy Grits, preacher Jubal Lee, and a boy named Quyat Burp. The neighboring Kyute Indian tribe includes Chief Horse&#x27;s Neck, his ugly but sweet daughter Moonglow, and her persistent suitor Crazy Quilt.

==Books==
Lynde and his wife formed Cottonwood Publishing, which later acquired the rights to &quot;Rick O&#x27;Shay&quot;. The company has published reprints, posters, collectibles, and a new two-part comic-book story, &quot;The Price of Fame&quot; (1992), featuring Rick and Hipshot. They reprinted all of the dailies from the beginning through 1964, except for one week in December 1963. They also published &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot;, reprinting 60 Sunday strips from the 1970s, 32 of which are in color. Further plans for reprints were put on hold after some of the original artwork was destroyed in a fire.

&quot;The Menomonee Falls Gazette&quot; reprinted dailies from September 24, 1973, to March 13, 1976. &quot;Comics Revue&quot; magazine reprinted strips from the week missing in the Cotonwood books in issue #231, and is reprinting all of the dailies, starting where Cottonwood Publishing left off, in issues #227. They have published all of the Stan Lynde dailies, and are currently publishing the Sundays.

==Style==
The backgrounds were realistically drawn; the characters were originally cartoonish, but became more realistic over the years. Surreal themes are mixed in (such as the pun-laden names). By the late 1960s, elements of adventure, philosophy, morality, and tragedy — such as Hipshot teetering on the brink of death following a gunfight — were added to the storyline.

Hipshot is frequently referred to as an &quot;outlaw&quot;, and in one strip, he decided to regain his losses at poker by holding up the local bank. Sometimes in the Sunday strip, he is shown alone, on horseback, in the Western background, speaking to his Maker, whom he addresses as &quot;Boss&quot;. He does not attend church and prefers to recognize his God in a privately styled fashion.

<text>Rebekka Lynn Armstrong is an American HIV/AIDS activist and former model and bodybuilder. She was &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month for September 1986. Eight years later, she was the first Playmate to publicly announce that she is HIV-positive.

==Biography==
Armstrong announced that she is HIV-positive in the September 1994 issue of &quot;The Advocate&quot;. She said that she had known she was infected since 1989, but spent two years after her diagnosis escaping into substance abuse. By the time of the publication of &quot;The Advocate&quot; article, she had come out as a lesbian and decided to educate others about HIV/AIDS, especially among lesbian and bisexual women. She said she was unsure of when she had contracted the virus, but might have as early as age 16. Armstrong believes she may have contracted the HIV either through a blood transfusion after she was rushed into surgery following complications from an abortion, or it may have been from a heterosexual encounter with a man who later informed her he was HIV-positive due to his bisexual encounters. By the time she was interviewed in 1999 for AIDS Project Los Angeles she identified as bisexual and said she had been infected at 16 &quot;to the best of my knowledge.&quot; A University of Toledo events notice in 2004 said that &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner and the Playboy Foundation assisted Armstrong financially on her AIDS-awareness campaign, the College Campus Safer Sex education program.

In a 2013 speech to community college students in Spokane, Washington, Armstrong shared details about the early days of her illness, the aggressive AZT treatment that she endured, the good and bad times of that five-year period, and about her suicide attempt followed by a coma and a lengthy hospital stay.

In addition to her former career as a model and her current activism, Armstrong has also competed as a bodybuilder.

<doc id="943885" wikidata="Q1327350" url="?curid=943885" title="Electronic meeting system">
<text>An electronic meeting system (EMS) is a type of computer software that facilitates creative problem solving and decision-making of groups within or across organizations. The term was coined by Alan R. Dennis et al. in 1988. The term is synonymous with group support systems (GSS) and essentially synonymous with group decision support systems (GDSS). Electronic meeting systems form a class of applications for computer supported cooperative work.

Mainly through (optional) anonymization and parallelization of input, electronic meeting systems overcome many deleterious and inhibitive features of group work.

Similar to a web conference, a host invites the participants to an electronic meeting via email. After logging into the session, meeting attendees participate primarily through their keyboards, typing responses to questions and prompts from the meeting host.

==Delineation==

Electronic meeting systems need to be distinguished on the one hand from classic groupware, on the other from web conferencing systems. In reality, there is some overlap between minor features of products of the named categories.

The main difference from groupware is the intensity of collaboration. According to Lubich&#x27;s classification, groupware supports collaboration within groups where the individual contributions remain identifiable. In contrast, EMS enable the group to cooperatively produce a result for which the group is responsible as a whole. In a business process, groupware and electronic meeting systems complement each other: Groupware supports teams when researching and creating documents in the run up to an EMS session or when implementing the results of such a session.

Web conferencing systems and electronic meeting systems complement each other in the online meeting or workshop: EMS extends the web conferencing system by providing interactive tools for producing and documenting group results. On the other hand, web conferencing systems complement EMS with the screensharing and voice conferencing functionality required in synchronous online meetings and not present in EMS.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Nunamaker et al. cite the CASE project PSL/PSA of the mid sixties as the beginnings of EMS technology. The first systems recognizable as EMS from today&#x27;s perspective developed in the early 1980s as university and research projects. (1) At the University of Arizona, a prototype called Plexsys was developed building on the PSL/PSA project. (2) At the University of Minnesota a system called SAMM (Software Aided Meeting Management) was created. (3) At Xerox PARC, Colab was developed. (4) Researchers at the University of Michigan developed MAC-based EMS-tools.

The efforts differed in their goals: While work at Xerox PARC focused on small cooperating groups of 2 – 6 individuals, work at the University of Arizona focused on groups of 16 – 24.

The late 1980s saw the beginnings of a commercial market for EMS. In 1989, the University of Arizona founded Ventana Corporation to transfer the Plexsys technology from the laboratory to the workplace. In 1992 Xerox PARC spun off Live Works Inc which developed the product LiveBoard based on the project Colab.

===1990s: Early LAN-based systems===

Group Systems, which was developed by the Ventana Corporation, is generally acknowledged to be the ancestor of modern EMS. Group Systems provided the standard functionality of modern EMS such as brainstorming and categorization, votes and discussions in the context of a chronological agenda. Contributions could be entered in parallel and anonymously. The results of one step of the meeting process e.g., a brainstorming, could be copied to a follow-up tool e.g., a vote.

The product was based on Clients running on Microsoft Windows machines which accessed a server running a Paradox database via a mapped drive on the local network (LAN). The limitation to local (&quot;same place&quot;) meetings, the substantial infrastructure requirements and the complexities of controlling the software prevented widespread adoption. Consequently, Group Systems was developed as a tool for the expert facilitator of computer-aided meetings. These meetings were often conducted in custom computer-equipped conference rooms or by specialised consultancies with dedicated kit.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s further EMS such as the Dutch &quot;Inteam&quot; or the American &quot;Meetingworks&quot; sprang up. As LAN-based client-server systems they shared the limitations of such systems. In contrast, facilitate.com adopted HTML suffering the (then) severe functional limitations of that technology for the advantage of working over the Internet.

===Web applications===

Since 2005 EMS development has focused on browser-based systems and easy to use GUIs. Prototypical for this generation of EMS are the product &quot;Thinktank&quot; which is based on Group Systems, the later &quot;MeetingSphere&quot; the anonymous electronic brainstorming focused &quot;Monsoon&quot; and the pure HTML &quot;yet another Meeting&quot; All of these products deliver the functionality of an EMS over the Internet, however, they differ as to their focus and functional depth: MeetingSphere and Spilter are very complete, functional, user-friendly and professional. ThinkTank provides and extends rich functionality with an eye to professionally facilitated workshops. yaM, and other pure HTML options position their products as integrated tool kits for everyday online meetings and workshops as well as the asynchronous work of virtual teams.

A special role is played amongst EMS by the product &quot;nextModerator&quot; which provides interactive tools to very large groups assembled in one location for a special event.

On the territory of post Soviet countries and Western Europe an important part in popularization and development of EMSs in recent years played locally-developed systems like &quot;SW 6000&quot;, PATENTEM, &quot;GlavCom&quot; etc.

==Standard functionality==

An electronic meeting system is a suite of configurable collaborative software tools that can be used to create predictable, repeatable patterns of collaboration among people working toward a goal. With an electronic meeting system, each user typically has his or her own computer, and each user can contribute to the same shared object (session) at the same time. Thus, nobody needs to wait for a turn to speak and people don&#x27;t forget what they want to say while they are waiting for the floor. When a group or a group&#x27;s host deem it appropriate, people can contribute anonymously to most electronic meeting systems tools: this allows the group to focus on the content of ideas, rather than their sources.

Most EMS provide the standard functionalities described below but differ markedly in the handling and functional depth of these tools. Further, they differ by the set of additional tools they provide and by the way they are administered or integrated into a corporate IT environment. They also differ in the degree of interoperability with web conferencing systems for screen sharing and voice conferencing.

===Brainstorming and categorization===

In an electronic brainstorming, the group creates a shared list of ideas. In contrast to paper-based brainstorming or brain-writing methods, contributions are directly entered by the participants and immediately visible to all, typically in anonymous format. By overcoming social barriers with anonymity and process limitations with parallelized input, more ideas are generated and shared with less conformity than in a traditional brainstorming or brain-writing session. The benefits of electronic brainstorming increase with group size.

In many cases, subsequent to a brainstorming session or the collection of contributions, ideas require categorization. For this, in modern EMS, participants drag contributions from the shared list to category folders or buckets.

===Discussion===

Discussion tools in EMS resemble a structured chat which may be conducted on separate topics in parallel, often based on a superordinate task or question. Parallelization occurs at multiple levels: (1) At the level of multiple topics which are presented for discussion at the same time. Participants are free to contribute to some topics while merely scanning others. (2) Further, parallelization occurs at the level of contributions which the participants can enter independently of each other. Discussions are conducted anonymously or named. In most EMS group identity is also available (e.g., &quot;marketing department&quot;).

Compared to an oral discussion, an electronic discussion enables a much more intensive exchange of arguments in shorter time. With anonymity, interpersonal conflict is minimized, peer pressure reduced. In many cases, a parallel electronic discussion enables the exploration of topics which would have been bypassed in traditional settings for lack of time.

===Vote===
Sophisticated EMS provide a range of vote methods such as numeric scale, rank order, budget or multiple selection. In more advanced systems, a ballot list can be subjected to multiple votes on multiple criteria with different vote methods for utility or impact analysis. Results are available in real time, typically both as tables and charts.

Further features include integration with social media as well as a Q&amp;A system.

In contrast to voting methods available in traditional workshops such as raising hands or the placing of sticky notes on a white board, electronic votes are anonymous and provide for a more differentiated assessment of ideas, opinions or facts. Some EMS provide for voting with group identity for extra insight into the structure of consensus or dissent.

===Agenda===
Modern EMS organize the process of a meeting into an agenda which structures the activities of a meeting or workshop by topic, chronology and the use of a supporting tool. From the agenda, the host (facilitator) of the meeting invites (&quot;starts&quot;) the participants to contribute to the various activities. In some EMS, agendas can be copied from an existing meeting or from meeting templates.

===Automatic minutes===
The results of an EMS-based meeting exist as content in a database. The content can be exported to a file, delivered to an externally integrated system of record, or simply printed. Formatting and available file formats differ substantially between EMS, with commonly available options including HTML, Markdown, and office document formats.

==Synchronous and asynchronous meetings==
Modern EMS support both synchronous (participants meet at the same time) and asynchronous (participants contribute at different times) meetings.

Synchronous meetings provide for immediate, spontaneous interaction between participants. Asynchronous meetings increase participant availability by setting no more than a time frame in which the participants are free to contribute in their own time. Asynchronous meetings are a good option when reflected input is required rather than instant spontaneous interaction.

Technically, synchronous and asynchronous meetings differ by the time for which tools are available to the participants. In a typical synchronous meeting, all participants are active in one shared activity. For this, synchronous meetings usually require support by a voice conference for oral interaction within the group and screen sharing by web conference for presenting non-EMS content.

In contrast, asynchronous sessions often involve multiple activities for contribution. The actual meeting and direct interaction between two or more participants in a particular activity are coincidental. Asynchronous sessions are often employed for gathering feedback or input. Asynchronous sessions can be conducted independently of synchronous meetings or in the run-up to such meetings or in the aftermath, e.g. to discuss questions unresolved in the meeting.

EMS differ substantially in the way and the extent to which they support asynchronous meetings. Differences include the duration of asynchronous meetings (24 hours/days/weeks), support for planning and publication of asynchronous meetings (agenda, invitations) and the licensing model (flat-rate, pay-per-use, concurrent meetings, concurrent users, etc.).

==Advantages ==
Electronic meeting systems have been designed to enhance group effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. Face-to-face groups can suffer from a number of process losses including:
* domination of the conversation by one or more members
* individuals withholding comments for fear of criticism or negative evaluation
* members failing to participate because they perceive that their input is not required
* pressure to conform with senior members of the group

Consequently, the advantages of EMS supported meetings vs traditional face-to-face meetings and workshops are:

* increased openness and less personal prejudice through anonymity
* any-place (online) capability which avoids travel time and cost
* increased participant availability (any place, any time).
* increased interactivity and participation by parallelization
* more sophisticated analysis by voting and analysis in real time
* less effort in preparation by using meeting templates
* repeatable meeting and workshop process through meeting templates
* automatic, comprehensive, neutral documentation

==Disadvantages ==
The majority of drawbacks of EMS versus traditional conferences or workshops have been overcome by technological progress or by adaptation of EMS to particular target groups and their dominant use cases:

* the formerly high infrastructure requirements have been reduced to Internet access and a web browser
* the formerly high demands on facilitators have been greatly reduced in systems that are designed to support everyday use by the non-expert user
* the traditional cultural barriers to the use of technology in meetings have been overcome through the general familiarization of users with telephone and web conferences.

The remaining drawbacks mostly result from the physical distribution of the participants when meeting online. Video conferences can only make up in part for not meeting in person.

<text>Heinrich Graetz (; 31 October 1817 – 7 September 1891) was a German and one of the first historians to write a comprehensive history of the Jewish people from a Jewish perspective.

Born Tzvi Hirsch Graetz to a butcher family in Xions (now Książ Wielkopolski), Grand Duchy of Posen, in Prussia (now in Poland), he attended Breslau University, but since Jews at that time were barred from receiving Ph.D.s there, he obtained his doctorate from the University of Jena. After 1845 he was principal of the Jewish Orthodox school of the Breslau community, and later taught history at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland). 

His magnum opus &quot;History of the Jews&quot; was the first Jewish history which threaded together a unified national history across the global Jewish communities. It was quickly translated into other languages and ignited worldwide interest in Jewish history, and later was used as a textbook in Israeli schools. As a result, Graetz was widely considered a Zionist or proto-Zionist, but historians have also noted his support for European assimilation.

In 1869 the University of Breslau (Wrocław) granted him the title of Honorary Professor. In 1888 he was appointed an Honorary Member of the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences.

==Biography==
Graetz received his first instruction at Zerkow, where his parents had relocated, and in 1831 was sent to Wollstein, where he attended the yeshivah up to 1836, acquiring secular knowledge by private study. The (&quot;Nineteen Letters on Judaism&quot;) by Samson Raphael Hirsch, which were published under the pseudonym of &quot;Ben Uziel&quot; at Altona in 1836, made a powerful impression on him; and he resolved to prepare himself for academic studies in order to champion the cause of Orthodox Judaism. His first intention was to go to Prague, to which place he was attracted by the fame of its old yeshivah and the facilities afforded by the university. Being rejected by the immigration officers, he returned to Zerkov and wrote to Hirsch, then rabbi of Oldenburg, indicating his desire. Hirsch offered him a place in his house. Graetz arrived there on May 8, 1837, and spent three years with his patron as a pupil, companion, and amanuensis. In 1840 he accepted a tutorship with a family at Ostrowo, and in October 1842 he entered the University of Breslau.

At that time the controversy between Orthodoxy and Reform Judaism was at its height, and Graetz, true to the principles which he had imbibed from Hirsch, began his literary career by writing contributions to the &quot;Orient&quot;, edited by Julius Fürst, in which he severely criticized the Reform party, as well as Geiger&#x27;s text-book of the Mishnah (&quot;Orient&quot;, 1844). These contributions and his championship of the Conservative cause during the time of the Reform Rabbinical Conferences made him popular with the Orthodox party. This was especially the case when he agitated for a vote of confidence to be given to Zecharias Frankel after he had left in protest the Second Rabbinical Conference in Frankfurt in 1845 after the majority had decided against prayers in Hebrew, and for prayers in the vernacular. After Graetz had obtained his Ph.D. from the University of Jena (his dissertation being &quot;De Auctoritate et Vi Quam Gnosis in Judaismum Habuerit,&quot; 1845; published a year later under the title &quot;Gnosticismus und Judenthum&quot;), he was made principal of a religious school founded by the Conservatives in Breslau, again under the leadership of Frankel. In the same year he was invited to preach a trial sermon before the congregation of Gleiwitz, Silesia, but failed completely.

He remained in Breslau until 1848, when, upon the advice of a friend, he went to Vienna, purposing to follow a journalistic career. On the way he stopped at Nikolsburg, where Hirsch was residing as Moravian chief rabbi. Hirsch, who then contemplated the start of a rabbinical seminary, employed Graetz temporarily as teacher at Nikolsburg, and made him principal of the Jewish school in the neighboring city of Lundenburg (1850). In October 1850, Graetz married Marie Monasch, the daughter of the printer and publisher B. L. Monasch, of Krotoschin. It seems that Hirsch&#x27;s departure from Nikolsburg had an influence on Graetz&#x27;s position; for in 1852 the latter left Lundenburg and went to Berlin, where he delivered a course of less than successful lectures on Jewish history to rabbinical students. His advocacy of Frankel&#x27;s approach had brought him into close contact with the latter, for whose magazine he frequently wrote articles; and accordingly in 1854 he was appointed a member of the teaching staff of the seminary at Breslau, over which Frankel presided. In this position he remained up to his death, teaching history and Bible exegesis, with a preparatory course on the Talmud. In 1869 the government conferred upon him the title of professor, and thenceforward he lectured at Breslau University.

In 1872 Graetz went to Palestine in the company of his friend Gottschalck Levy of Berlin, for the purpose of studying the scenes of the earliest period of Jewish history, which he treated in volumes one and two of his history, published in 1874–1876; these volumes brought that great work to a close. While in Palestine, he gave the first impetus to the foundation of an orphan asylum there. He also took a great interest in the progress of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, and participated as a delegate in the convention assembled at Paris in 1878 in the interest of the Romanian Jews. Graetz&#x27;s name was prominently mentioned in the anti-Semitic controversy, especially after Treitschke had published his &quot;Ein Wort über Unser Judenthum&quot; (1879–1880), in which the latter, referring to the eleventh volume of the history, accused Graetz of hatred of Christianity and of bias against the German people, quoting him as a proof that the Jews could never assimilate themselves to their surroundings.

This arraignment of Graetz had a decided effect upon the public. Even friends of the Jews, like Mommsen, and advocates of Judaism within the Jewish fold expressed their condemnation of Graetz&#x27;s passionate language. It was due to this comparative unpopularity that Graetz was not invited to join the commission created by the union of German Jewish congregations (Deutsch-Israelitischer Gemeindebund) for the promotion of the study of the history of the Jews of Germany (1885). On the other hand, his fame spread to foreign countries; and the promoters of the Anglo-Jewish Exhibition invited him in 1887 to open the Exhibition with a lecture. His seventieth birthday was the occasion for his friends and disciples to bear testimony to the universal esteem in which he was held among them; and a volume of scientific essays was published in his honor (&quot;Jubelschrift zum 70. Geburtstage des Prof. Dr. H. Graetz,&quot; Breslau, 1887). A year later (27 October 1888) he was appointed an honorary member of the Spanish Academy, to which, as a token of his gratitude, he dedicated the third edition of the eighth volume of his history.

As usual he spent the summer of 1891 in Carlsbad; but alarming symptoms of heart disease forced him to discontinue his use of the waters. He went to Munich to visit his son Leo, a professor at the university of that city, and died there after a brief illness. He was buried in Breslau. Besides Leo, Graetz left three sons and one daughter.

==Works==

===History of the Jews===
Graetz is chiefly known as the Jewish historian, although he did considerable work in the field of exegesis also. His &quot;Geschichte der Juden&quot; superseded all former works of its kind, notably that of Jost, in its day a very remarkable production; and it has been translated into many languages. The fourth volume, beginning with the period following the destruction of Jerusalem, was published first. It appeared in 1853; but the publication was not a financial success, and the publisher refused to continue it. However, the publication society Institut zur Förderung der Israelitischen Litteratur, founded by Ludwig Philippson, had just come into existence, and it undertook the publication of the subsequent volumes, beginning with the third, which covered the period from the death of Judas Maccabeus to the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem. This was published in 1856 and was followed by the fifth, after which the volumes appeared in regular succession up to the eleventh, which was published in 1870 and brought the history down to 1848, with which year the author closed, not wishing to include living persons.

In spite of this reserve he gravely offended the Liberal party, which inferred, from articles that Graetz contributed to the &quot;Monatsschrift&quot;, that he would show little sympathy for the Reform element, and therefore refused to publish the volume unless the manuscript was submitted for examination. This Graetz refused to do; and the volume therefore appeared without the support of the publication society. Volumes I and II were published, as stated above, after Graetz had returned from Palestine. These volumes, of which the second practically consisted of two, appeared in 1872–1875, and completed the stupendous undertaking. For more popular purposes Graetz published later an abstract of his work under the title &quot;Volksthümliche Geschichte der Juden&quot;, in which he brought the history down to his own time.

The fourth volume of the &quot;History of the Jews&quot; received a detailed review by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch in a series of essays in Vols. II-IV (1855-8) of his monthly journal &quot;Jeschurun&quot;. In these essays, Hirsch argues that Graetz is guilty of sloppiness of scholarship: e.g., Graetz omits the second halves of quotations which, if quoted in their entirety, contradict his thesis. Graetz claims, on the basis of quotations from certain Talmudic sages, that they &quot;were wont to do&quot; something – despite sources explicitly to the contrary – and goes on to develop these suppositions into theories affecting the entire Torah tradition. Hirsch accuses Graetz of fabricating dates, rearranging generations, overstating results, misinterpreting and distorting the Talmudic tradition to serve his narrative needs. David N. Myers argues that Hirsch&#x27;s criticisms of his one-time student&#x27;s work were motivated by a complete difference of opinion on the value of historicism. &quot;Hirsch came to regard his erstwhile disciple as the embodiment of history&#x27;s destructive tendencies.&quot;

A translation into English was begun by S. Tuska, who in 1867 published in Cincinnati a translation of part of Vol. IX under the title &quot;Influence of Judaism on the Protestant Reformation&quot;. The fourth volume was translated by James K. Gutheim under the auspices of the American Jewish Publication Society, the title being &quot;History of the Jews from the Down-fall of the Jewish State to the Conclusion of the Talmud&quot; (New York, 1873).

A five-volume English edition was published in London in 1891-92 as &quot;History of the Jews from the Earliest Times to the Present Day&quot; (5 vols.; edited and in part translated by Bella Löwy). According to a review in the January–April 1893 edition of &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;, it &quot;was passing through the press in its English version, and had received the author&#x27;s final touches, when Graetz died in September 1891&quot;. In 1919, the Jordan Publishing Co. of New York published a two-volume &quot;improved&quot; edition, with a supplement of recent events by Dr. Max Raisin. Rabbi A. B. Rhine provided the English translation.

===Exegesis===
Graetz&#x27;s historical studies, extending back to Biblical times, naturally led him into the field of exegesis. As early as the fifties he had written in the &quot;Monatsschrift&quot; essays dealing with exegetical subjects, as &quot;Fälschungen in dem Texte der LXX.&quot; (1853) and &quot;Die Grosse Versammlung: Keneset Hagedola&quot; (1857); and with his translation of and commentaries on Ecclesiastes and Canticles (Breslau, 1871) he began the publication of separate exegetical works. A commentary and translation of the Psalms followed (ib. 1882–83). Toward the end of his life he planned an edition of the whole Hebrew Bible with his own textual emendations. A prospectus of this work appeared in 1891. Shortly before the author&#x27;s death, a part of it, Isaiah and Jeremiah, was issued in the form in which the author had intended to publish it; the rest contained only the textual notes, not the text itself. It was edited, under the title &quot;Emendationes in Plerosque Sacræ Scripturæ Veteris Testamenti Libros,&quot; by W. Bacher (Breslau, 1892–94).

The most characteristic features of Graetz&#x27;s exegesis are his bold textual emendations, which often substitute something conjectural for the Masoretic text, although he always carefully consulted the ancient versions. He also determined with too much certainty the period of a Biblical book or a certain passage, when at best there could only be a probable hypothesis. Thus his hypothesis of the origin of Ecclesiastes at the time of Herod the Great, while brilliant in its presentation, is hardly tenable. His textual emendations display fine tact, and of late they have become more and more respected and adopted.

===Other literary work===
Graetz had contributed scholarly articles on Judaism and history to the scholarly periodicals started by Frankel since his graduation from the university in 1846. He continued steadily in this task once the &quot;Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judenthums&quot; was firmly established under Frankel&#x27;s editorship in Breslau, between 1851 and 1853. Frankel and Graetz practically took over the periodical with the leadership of the concept of &quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot; from its Reform initiators, Leopold Zunz and Eduard Gans. After Frankel&#x27;s retirement from the editorship in 1869, Graetz took over the task himself for the next 18 years, until he reached the age of 70 in 1887.

Graetz&#x27;s activity was not limited to his special field. He enriched other branches of Jewish science and wrote here and there on general literature or on questions of the day. To the field of general literature also belongs his essay on &quot;Shylock,&quot; published in the &quot;Monatsschrift&quot;, 1880. In the early years of the anti-Semitic movement he wrote, besides the articles in which he defended himself against the accusations of Treitschke, an anonymous essay entitled &quot;Briefwechsel einer Englischen Dame über Judenthum und Semitismus&quot; (Stuttgart, 1883). To supplement his lectures on Jewish literature he published an anthology of neo-Hebraic poetry under the title &quot;Leḳeṭ Shoshannim&quot; (Breslau, 1862), in which he made the mistake of reading the verses of a poem horizontally instead of vertically, which mistake Geiger mercilessly criticized (&quot;Jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben&quot;, 1, p. 68-75). A very meritorious work was his edition of the Jerusalem Talmud in one volume (Krotoschin, 1866). A bibliography of his works has been given by Israel Abrahams in &quot;The Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; (4, pp. 194–203).

====The Kompert Affair====

Graetz&#x27;s essay &quot;Die Verjüngung des jüdischen Stammes&quot;, in Wertheimer-Kompert&#x27;s &quot;Jahrbuch für Israeliten&quot;, Vol. X, Vienna, 1863 (reprinted with comments by Th. Zlocisti, in &quot;Jüdischer Volks-Kalender&quot;, p. 99, Brünn, 1903), caused a suit to be brought against him by Sebastian Brunner for libeling him as an anti-Semite. As Graetz was not an Austrian subject, the suit was nominally brought against Leopold Kompert as editor, and the latter was fined (30 December 1863).

Graetz had interpreted Isaiah chapters 52 and 53 to refer not to the personal Messiah, but rather to the entire people of Israel. Graetz and Kompert were brought to court in Vienna for publishing claims that were contrary to the Catholic faith, as well as contradicting Jewish tradition. Viennese rabbis Isaak Noah Mannheimer and Lazar Horowitz defended Graetz, and Azriel Hildesheimer criticized them for doing so; Isaac Hirsch Weiss published a pamphlet entitled &quot;Neẓaḥ Yisrael&quot; in support of their testimony.

This case, known as the &quot;Kompert Affair,&quot; was important in defining the wedge between Orthodox Judaism and the nascent Conservative Judaism championed by the likes of Graetz and Zecharias Frankel. Thus, within the Jewish fold the lawsuit also had its consequences, as the Orthodox raised against Graetz the accusation of heresy because he had denied the personal character of the prophetic Messiah.

==Legacy==
Graetz&#x27;s history became very popular and influential in its time. The material for Jewish history being so varied, the sources so scattered in the literatures of all nations, and the chronological sequence so often interrupted, made the presentation of this history as a whole a very difficult undertaking. Graetz performed his task skillfully, mastering most of the details while not losing sight of the whole. Another reason for the popularity of the work is its sympathetic treatment. Also, Graetz has been credited with finding a copying error in I Corinthians 1:12 which should have referred to a very early Christian teacher. This history of the Jews is not written by a cool observer, but by a warm-hearted Jew. On the other hand, some of these commendable features are at the same time shortcomings. 

In his introduction to a 1975 volume of Graetz&#x27;s essays translated into English, rabbi and historian Ismar Schorsch wrote of &quot;History of the Jews&quot;: &quot;[It] still remains, a century later, the best single introduction to the totality of Jewish history... The extraordinary combination of narrative skill and basic research which was the hallmark of Graetz&#x27;s work has never been matched.&quot;

Some characterize Graetz&#x27;s main elements of Jewish experience through the ages to be &#x27;suffering and spiritual scholarship&#x27;, while later Jewish scholarly works like Salo W. Baron&#x27;s 1937 &quot;A Social and Religious History of the Jews&quot;, opposed the view of Jewish history as being &#x27;all darkness and no light&#x27; and sought to restore balance, by writing a social history. Baron strove to integrate the religious dimension of Jewish history into a full picture of Jewish life and to integrate the history of Jews into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived. Baron brought very distinctive views to his scholarship. He inveighed against what he termed the &quot;lachrymose conception of Jewish history,&quot; sometimes identified with Heinrich Graetz. In a 1975 interview Baron said: &quot;Suffering is part of the destiny [of the Jews], but so is repeated joy as well as ultimate redemption.&quot; According to Arthur Hertzberg, Baron was writing social history, insisting that spiritual creativity and the political situation were all borne by a living society and its changing forms.

<doc id="943899" wikidata="Q7884622" url="?curid=943899" title="The War Prayer">
<text>&quot;The War Prayer&quot;, a short story or prose poem by Mark Twain, is a scathing indictment of war, and particularly of blind patriotic and religious fervor as motivations for war. The structure of the work is simple: an unnamed country goes to war, and patriotic citizens attend a church service for soldiers who have been called up. The people call upon God to grant them victory and protect their troops. Suddenly, an &quot;aged stranger&quot; appears and announces that he is God&#x27;s messenger. He explains to them that he is there to speak aloud the second part of their prayer for victory, the part which they have implicitly wished for but have not spoken aloud themselves: the prayer for the suffering and destruction of their enemies. What follows is a grisly depiction of hardships inflicted on war-torn nations by their conquerors. The story ends with the man being condemned as a lunatic, &quot;for there was no sense in what he said&quot;.

==History==
&quot;The War Prayer&quot; was written in 1905, and is believed to be a response to both the Spanish–American War and the subsequent Philippine–American War. It was left unpublished by Mark Twain at his death in April 1910, largely due to pressure from his family, who feared that the story would be considered sacrilegious. Twain&#x27;s publisher and other friends also discouraged him from publishing it. According to one account, his illustrator Dan Beard asked him if he would publish it anyway, and Twain replied, &quot;No, I have told the whole truth in that, and only dead men can tell the truth in this world. It can be published after I am dead.&quot; Mindful of public reaction, he considered that he had a family to support and did not want to be seen as a lunatic or fanatic. 

Many sites on the internet claim that &quot;The War Prayer&quot; was first published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in November 1916, but this was the concluding chapter of a different Twain story, &quot;The Mysterious Stranger.&quot; It was, however, included in &quot;Europe and Elsewhere&quot; (1923), a collection of Twain&#x27;s essays edited by Albert Bigelow Paine, Twain&#x27;s literary estate agent and biographer.
==Works based on the short story==
The 1981 PBS filmed version of Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Private History of a Campaign That Failed&quot; contains &quot;The War Prayer&quot; as an epilogue, which takes place during the Spanish–American War. Edward Herrmann played the Stranger, as well as the innocent man who had been killed accidentally by the boys years before in the American Civil War, thus lending a supernatural air to the Stranger&#x27;s origins.

In 1996, Melvin Belli recited the oratory to David Woodard&#x27;s brass fanfare setting of &quot;The War Prayer&quot; at Old First Church in San Francisco.

In 2006, the short film, &quot;War Prayer&quot; (2005), won the Best Director Award at the Beverly Hills Film Festival. Harold Cronk directed the film and adapted the screenplay from Twain&#x27;s &quot;The War Prayer&quot;.

In April 2007, a ten-minute, short film adaptation, entitled &quot;The War Prayer&quot;, was released by Lyceum Films. Written by Marco Sanchez and directed by Michael Goorjian, the adaptation starred Jeremy Sisto as &quot;The Stranger&quot; and Tim Sullivan as &quot;The Preacher&quot;.

That same year, the journalist and &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; president Markos Kounalakis directed and produced an animated short film based on Twain&#x27;s piece, also entitled &quot;The War Prayer&quot;. Narrated by Peter Coyote, it starred Lawrence Ferlinghetti as the Minister and Eric Bauersfeld as the Stranger.

In 2023, an illustrated book, entitled &quot;Mark Twain&#x27;s War Prayer&quot;, was released. Illustrated by Seymour Chwast and including abridged words by Mark Twain regarding &quot;The Lowest Animal&quot;.

<text>IDW Publishing is an American publisher of comic books, graphic novels, art books, and comic strip collections. It was founded in 1999 as the publishing division of Idea and Design Works, LLC (IDW) and is recognized as the fifth-largest comic book publisher in the United States, behind Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, and Image Comics, ahead of other comic book publishers such as Archie, Boom!, Dynamite, Valiant, and Oni Press. The company is known for its licensed comic book adaptations of films, television shows, video games, and cartoons.

==History==

===1990s===
Idea and Design Works (IDW) was formed in 1999 by a group of comic book managers and artists (Ted Adams, Robbie Robbins, Alex Garner, and Kris Oprisko) that first met while working at Wildstorm Productions. Each of the four was equal partners, owning 25%. When Jim Lee sold Wildstorm to DC Comics in 1999, Lee turned that company&#x27;s creative service department, previously run by Adams, over to IDW, allowing IDW to be profitable in its first year. With these profits, the firm decided to fund a new venture every year.

===2000s===
In 2000, IDW developed a TV show concept, getting as far as a pilot episode. For the 2001&#x27;s project, Adams&#x27;s Ashley Wood talked to them about publishing an art book, thus starting up IDW Publishing. &quot;Una Fanta&quot; was published in March 2002. Woods had Steve Niles send Adams some of his rejected screenplays. Adams selected one, &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, and paired him with artist Ben Templesmith for a comic adaptation as a three-issue series, beginning in August 2002. With low pre-orders, Adams personally pushed the comic with the distributor and major comic book stores. Soon the title&#x27;s back issues were hot and were followed up with Wood&#x27;s &quot;Popbot&quot;.

In 2007, IDT Corporation purchased a 53% majority interest in IDW from the company&#x27;s founders, removing Garner &amp; Oprisko, while reducing Adams &amp; Robbins to minority owners collectively at 47%. Then, in 2009, IDT proceeded to increase its interest to the current 76%, reducing Adams &amp; Robbins&#x27;s interest once again to the current 24%. Then, shortly afterwards, IDT created CTM Media Holdings via a tax-free spin-off. This new company consisted of the majority interest in IDW and CTM Media Group. Eight years later, on April 3, 2015, CTM Media Holdings announced it would continue operations under a new name, becoming IDW Media Holdings, which would continue to consist of the majority interest in IDW and CTM Media Group.

The company&#x27;s first traditional comic series, &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, created by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith started a seven-figure bidding war between DreamWorks, MGM, and Senator International, with Senator winning and Sam Raimi attached to produce.

IDW Publishing&#x27;s second title, &quot;Popbot&quot;, won two Gold Spectrum Awards.

IDW Publishing also publishes comics based on the TV franchises &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;CSI&quot;. The company&#x27;s other licensed comics include Topps&#x27; &quot;Mars Attacks&quot;, Sony&#x27;s &quot;Underworld&quot;, FX&#x27;s &quot;The Shield&quot;, Fox&#x27;s &quot;24&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;; Universal’s &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;; and Konami’s &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;Castlevania&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and &quot;Speed Racer&quot;. The company has also had success with comic license from toy company Hasbro brands: &quot;The Transformers&quot; (with Takara), &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, &quot;My Little Pony&quot;, and &quot;Jem&quot;. Transformers has had as many as five different titles running concurrently.

Beginning in 2008, the company licensed the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series from the BBC, launching two concurrent titles: &quot;Doctor Who Classics&quot;, which reprints colorized comic strips featuring the past Doctors such as the Fourth Doctor and Fifth Doctor originally published in the late 1970s-early 1980s by &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Who: Agent Provocateur&quot;, an original six-part limited series featuring the Tenth Doctor and overseen and written by TV series script editor Gary Russell. An additional six-part limited series titled &quot;Doctor Who: The Forgotten&quot; started in mid-2008 by Tony Lee and Pia Guerra, as well as a series of monthly one-shot, self-contained stories. July 2009 saw the beginning of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, an ongoing series featuring the Tenth Doctor, written by Tony Lee and illustrated by a rotating art team.

IDW Publishing acquired the G.I. Joe comics license in May 2008 (previously held by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing) and released three new series under editor Andy Schmidt, from writers such as Chuck Dixon, Larry Hama, and Christos Gage. Other comics were released in time to tie-in with the summer 2009 &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; film.

In March 2009, IDW Publishing forged an agreement with Mike Gold&#x27;s Comicmix.com to publish print versions of Comicmix&#x27;s online comic books. The agreement stipulates Comicmix must provide two comic books a month to IDW Publishing to publish, as well as graphic novels and trade paperbacks as demanded by the market. The books are published with both the IDW Publishing and Comicmix.com logos on the covers. As of the end of 2009, the agreement has produced print versions of the &quot;Grimjack&quot; series &quot;The Manx Cat&quot;; the &quot;Jon Sable&quot; series &quot;Ashes of Eden&quot;; Mark Wheatley and Robert Tinnell&#x27;s pulp hero series &quot;Lone Justice&quot;; the graphic novel &quot;Demons of Sherwood&quot; by Tinnell and Bo Hampton; and a graphic novel collecting Trevor Von Eeden&#x27;s &quot;The Original Johnson&quot;. A collection of &quot;Munden&#x27;s Bar&quot; stories original to Comicmix&#x27;s website is also forthcoming.

In 2004, 2005, and 2006 IDW Publishing was named Publisher of the Year by Diamond Comic Distributors.

===2010s===
In 2010, IDW Publishing released the sequel to Michael San Giacomo&#x27;s &quot;Phantom Jack&quot; Image Comics series with &quot;Phantom Jack: The Nowhere Man Agenda.&quot; The graphic novel is notable because it features the death of the main character, a reporter who can turn invisible.

IDW Publishing formed an imprint with EA Games in late 2009, called EA Comics, to focus on adaptations of the latter&#x27;s video games, with initial titles including &quot;Army of Two&quot; and
&quot;Dragon Age&quot;.

In January 2011, IDW Publishing announced a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons comic series, under license from Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast. Set in the D&amp;D 4th Edition core setting, the new ongoing series &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Fell&#x27;s Five)&quot; ran for 16 issues. Several mini-series were also published including &quot;The Legend of Drizzt: Neverwinter Tales&quot; written by R.A. Salvatore. Since 2014, five five-issue mini-series have been published in the D&amp;D 5th Edition core setting. A sixth five-issue mini-series, &quot;Infernal Tide&quot;, is set to be published in November 2019.

In April 2011, IDW Publishing acquired the license to publish new collections of older &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics, as well as a new ongoing series beginning in August of that year. In August 2017 issue #73 of the main ongoing series was published, making it the longest running comic series in the franchise&#x27;s history.

September 6, 2011, for the 10th anniversary of 9/11, IDW Publishing teamed up Charlie Foxtrot Entertainment and released the graphic novel &quot;Code Word: Geronimo&quot;, written by retired Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye and Julia Dye, drawn by Gerry Kissell with inker Amin Amat. &quot;Code Word: Geronimo&quot; reached #22 on Diamond Comics top 100 list its first month after release. During that same year, the company has published its first crossover series &quot;Infestation&quot;.

In March 2012 IDW Publishing announced it would release new comics based on &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and &quot;The Crow&quot;. Also in 2012, Hasbro licensed the use of &quot;My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic&quot; for an IDW comic book series. The company also published &quot;Infestation 2&quot;.

In February 2013, IDW Publishing announced a partnership with Cartoon Network to publish comics based on the network&#x27;s television series and reprint older Cartoon Network comics.

On January 6, 2015, IDW Publishing announced it had acquired Top Shelf Productions.

In February 2015, it was announced that IDW Publishing made a deal with Disney to continue the publication of the following comic books: &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.

In 2016, IDW launched the Hasbro Reconstruction initiative to present a shared universe of Hasbro brands, which was later known as the Hasbro Comic Book Universe. The first event was &quot;Revolution&quot;, followed by &quot;First Strike&quot; on 2017.

In April 2017, IDW Publishing acquired a license from Lucasfilm to produce a range of all-ages Star Wars comics.

In July 2017, Sega announced a partnership with IDW to publish comics based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; beginning in 2018, following the conclusion/cancellation of the previous series by Archie Comics. IDW has also launched new imprint called Black Crown, handling creator-owned comics.

In April 2018, publishers IDW Publishing and Oni Press announced a crossover between the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; comic book and Dungeons &amp; Dragons co-written by Jim Zub and Patrick Rothfuss with art by Troy Little. The four issue mini-series, &quot;Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, was first published in August 2018. In May 2019, a sequel mini-series was announced: &quot;Rick and Morty vs. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Chapter II: Painscape.&quot; It will be written by Jim Zub and Sarah Stern with art by Troy Little.

In 2019, the company went under financial difficulties and got help from JPMorgan Chase evaluating strategies to be profitable.

In May 2019, IDW offered itself as an investor in Clover Press, a new independent publisher founded by Ted Adams (cofounder and former CEO of IDW) and Robbie Robbins (cofounder, executive vice president, and art director at IDW).

In July 2019, it was announced that IDW Publishing had acquired the classic Sunday strip publisher Sunday Press Books.

===2020s===
Between April and May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, IDW was forced to furlough and then lay off several employees, including Managing Editor Denton Tipton, Associate Publisher David Hedgecock, Senior Graphic Artist Gilberto Lazcano, Senior Graphic Designer Christa Miesner, and Brand &amp; Marketing Manager Spencer Reeve. In July 2020, Chris Ryall announced that he would step down from his position of President, Publisher, and Chief Creative Officer to launch a new imprint named Syzygy Publishing, but he is still editor of future &quot;Locke &amp; Key&quot; projects. Jerry Bennington was promoted to President, Nachie Marsham was promoted to Publisher, and Rebekah Cahalin was promoted to General Manager and Executive Vice President of Operations covering IDW Publishing, and Veronica Brooks was promoted to Vice President of Creative Affairs.

Around 2021, IDW announced that the comic book license for Disney properties would pass to Marvel Comics, while the license for Lucasfilm&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; passed back to Dark Horse Comics. In September 2021, IDW announced that its partnership with Diamond Comic Distributors would switch to Penguin Random House. In December 2021, The Library of American Comics announced that they would be moving to Clover Press. That same month, John Barber announced that he would step away from the role of Editor-in-Chief.

In January 2022, IDW announced that they would lose the comic book licenses for Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;Transformers&quot; and &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; by the end of the year, but would continue publishing other Hasbro licenses, including &quot;My Little Pony&quot; and Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

On April 27, 2023, IDW cut 39% of their staff and became privately-held by delisting from the New York Stock Exchange; the company also restructured its C-suite and experienced an almost 50% drop in its share price.

On October 16, 2024, IDW announced a rebranding with a new logo.

<doc id="943906" wikidata="Q143611" url="?curid=943906" title="Brunei at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Brunei, as &quot;Brunei Darussalam&quot;, competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, which took place between 13 and 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation in Athens marked its fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1988 Summer Olympics. 

The Brunei delegation included only one track and field athlete, meaning Brunei, along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein, sent the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games at one. The athlete selected was Jimmy Anak Ahar, who was a middle-distance runner that was selected via a wildcard as the nation had no athletes that met the &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; standards in any event. Ahar was also selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Ultimately, Ahar did not progress beyond the heats, meaning Brunei won no medals at this Summer Olympics.

==Background==
Although Brunei first participated in the Summer Olympic in the 1988 Summer Olympics in  Seoul, South Korea, it was only represented by one official. It would not be until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States that the country would send athletes to the Games. Since then, it has participated in four Summer Olympics between its debut and the 2004 Summer Olympics. No Brunei athlete had ever won a medal at the Summer Olympics before the 2004 Athens Games. 

The Brunei National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected one athlete via a wildcard. Usually, a NOC would be able to enter up to three qualified athletes in each individual event as long as each athlete met the &quot;A&quot; standard, or one athlete per event if they met the &quot;B&quot; standard. However, since Brunei had no athletes that met either standard, they were allowed to select an athlete as a wildcard. The one athlete that was selected to compete in the Athens Games was Jimmy Anak Ahar in the Men&#x27;s 1500 meters. Sending only one athlete to the Athens Games meant that the country, along with British Virgin Islands and Liechtenstein, was notable for sending the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games. Ahar was flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Among officials, sports official Sofian Ibrahim represented the country. 

==Athletics ==

Making his Summer Olympic debut, Jimmy Anak Ahar was notable for becoming the youngest ever competitor to represent Brunei at the Olympics aged 22. The age record stood until the 2012 Summer Olympics, when Anderson Chee Wei Lim surpassed it. Ahar qualified for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, as his best time, three minutes, 59.81 seconds at the 2003 Southeast Asian Games Men&#x27;s 1500 meters, was 21.81 seconds slower than the &quot;B&quot; qualifying standard required. He competed on 20 August in the Men&#x27;s 1500 meters against thirteen other athletes in the third heat. He ran a time of 4 minutes, 14.11 seconds, finishing 13th. He ranked ahead of Tanzania&#x27;s Samwel Mwera (who did not start), and behind Guam&#x27;s Neil Weare (4 minutes, 5.86 seconds), in a heat led by Great Britain&#x27;s Michael East (3 minutes, 37.37 seconds). Overall, Ahar placed 39th out of the 41 athletes that competed, and was 32.97 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the next round. Therefore, that was the end of his competition.

<doc id="943917" wikidata="Q1124546" url="?curid=943917" title="Laguerre polynomials">
<text>In mathematics, the Laguerre polynomials, named after Edmond Laguerre (1834–1886), are nontrivial solutions of Laguerre&#x27;s differential equation:
formula_1
which is a second-order linear differential equation. This equation has nonsingular solutions only if is a non-negative integer.

Sometimes the name Laguerre polynomials is used for solutions of
formula_2
where is still a non-negative integer.
Then they are also named generalized Laguerre polynomials, as will be done here (alternatively associated Laguerre polynomials or, rarely, Sonine polynomials, after their inventor Nikolay Yakovlevich Sonin).

More generally, a Laguerre function is a solution when is not necessarily a non-negative integer.

The Laguerre polynomials are also used for Gauss–Laguerre quadrature to numerically compute integrals of the form
formula_3

These polynomials, usually denoted , , ..., are a polynomial sequence which may be defined by the Rodrigues formula,

formula_4
reducing to the closed form of a following section.

They are orthogonal polynomials with respect to an inner product
formula_5

The rook polynomials in combinatorics are more or less the same as Laguerre polynomials, up to elementary changes of variables. Further see the Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials.

The Laguerre polynomials arise in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the Schrödinger equation for a one-electron atom. They also describe the static Wigner functions of oscillator systems in quantum mechanics in phase space. They further enter in the quantum mechanics of the Morse potential and of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

Physicists sometimes use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials that is larger by a factor of &quot;n&quot;! than the definition used here. (Likewise, some physicists may use somewhat different definitions of the so-called associated Laguerre polynomials.)

== The first few polynomials ==
These are the first few Laguerre polynomials:

== Recursive definition, closed form, and generating function ==
One can also define the Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as
formula_6
formula_7
and then using the following recurrence relation for any :
formula_8
Furthermore,
formula_9

In solution of some boundary value problems, the characteristic values can be useful:
formula_10

The closed form is
formula_11

The generating function for them likewise follows, 
formula_12The operator form is
formula_13

Polynomials of negative index can be expressed using the ones with positive index:
formula_14

== Generalized Laguerre polynomials ==
For arbitrary real α the polynomial solutions of the differential equation
formula_15
are called generalized Laguerre polynomials, or associated Laguerre polynomials.

One can also define the generalized Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as
formula_16
formula_17

and then using the following recurrence relation for any :
formula_18

The simple Laguerre polynomials are the special case of the generalized Laguerre polynomials:
formula_19

The Rodrigues formula for them is
formula_20

The generating function for them is
formula_21
=== Explicit examples and properties of the generalized Laguerre polynomials ===
* Laguerre functions are defined by confluent hypergeometric functions and Kummer&#x27;s transformation as formula_22 where formula_23 is a generalized binomial coefficient. When is an integer the function reduces to a polynomial of degree . It has the alternative expression formula_24 in terms of Kummer&#x27;s function of the second kind.
* The closed form for these generalized Laguerre polynomials of degree is formula_25 derived by applying Leibniz&#x27;s theorem for differentiation of a product to Rodrigues&#x27; formula.
* Laguerre polynomials have a differential operator representation, much like the closely related Hermite polynomials. Namely, let formula_26 and consider the differential operator formula_27. Then formula_28.
* The first few generalized Laguerre polynomials are:

* The coefficient of the leading term is ;
* The constant term, which is the value at 0, is formula_29

* If is non-negative, then &quot;L&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) has &quot;n&quot; real, strictly positive roots (notice that formula_30 is a Sturm chain), which are all in the interval formula_31
* The polynomials&#x27; asymptotic behaviour for large , but fixed and , is given by formula_32 and summarizing by formula_33 where formula_34 is the Bessel function.

=== As a contour integral ===
Given the generating function specified above, the polynomials may be expressed in terms of a contour integral
formula_35
where the contour circles the origin once in a counterclockwise direction without enclosing the essential singularity at 1

=== Recurrence relations ===
The addition formula for Laguerre polynomials:
formula_36

Laguerre&#x27;s polynomials satisfy the recurrence relations
formula_37
in particular
formula_38
and
formula_39
or
formula_40
moreover
formula_41

They can be used to derive the four 3-point-rules
formula_42

combined they give this additional, useful recurrence relationsformula_43

Since formula_44 is a monic polynomial of degree formula_45 in formula_46,
there is the partial fraction decomposition
formula_47
The second equality follows by the following identity, valid for integer &quot;i&quot; and and immediate from the expression of formula_44 in terms of Charlier polynomials:
formula_49
For the third equality apply the fourth and fifth identities of this section.

=== Derivatives of generalized Laguerre polynomials ===
Differentiating the power series representation of a generalized Laguerre polynomial times leads to
formula_50

This points to a special case () of the formula above: for integer the generalized polynomial may be written
formula_51
the shift by sometimes causing confusion with the usual parenthesis notation for a derivative.

Moreover, the following equation holds:
formula_52
which generalizes with Cauchy&#x27;s formula to
formula_53

The derivative with respect to the second variable has the form, 
formula_54
The generalized Laguerre polynomials obey the differential equation
formula_55
which may be compared with the equation obeyed by the &quot;k&quot;th derivative of the ordinary Laguerre polynomial,

formula_56
where formula_57 for this equation only.

In Sturm–Liouville form the differential equation is

formula_58

which shows that is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue .

=== Orthogonality ===
The generalized Laguerre polynomials are orthogonal over with respect to the measure with weighting function :

formula_59

which follows from

formula_60

If formula_61 denotes the gamma distribution then the orthogonality relation can be written as

formula_62

The associated, symmetric kernel polynomial has the representations (Christoffel–Darboux formula)

formula_63

recursively

formula_64

Moreover,

formula_65

Turán&#x27;s inequalities can be derived here, which is
formula_66

The following integral is needed in the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom,

formula_67

=== Series expansions ===
Let a function have the (formal) series expansion
formula_68

Then
formula_69

The series converges in the associated Hilbert space if and only if

formula_70

==== Further examples of expansions====
Monomials are represented as
formula_71
while binomials have the parametrization
formula_72

This leads directly to
formula_73
for the exponential function. The incomplete gamma function has the representation
formula_74

==In quantum mechanics==
In quantum mechanics the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen-like atom is exactly solvable by separation of variables in spherical coordinates. The radial part of the wave function is a (generalized) Laguerre polynomial.

Vibronic transitions in the Franck-Condon approximation can also be described using Laguerre polynomials.

==Multiplication theorems==
Erdélyi gives the following two multiplication theorems 

formula_75

== Relation to Hermite polynomials ==
The generalized Laguerre polynomials are related to the Hermite polynomials:
formula_76
where the are the Hermite polynomials based on the weighting function , the so-called &quot;physicist&#x27;s version.&quot;

Because of this, the generalized Laguerre polynomials arise in the treatment of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

== Relation to hypergeometric functions ==
The Laguerre polynomials may be defined in terms of hypergeometric functions, specifically the confluent hypergeometric functions, as
formula_77
where formula_78 is the Pochhammer symbol (which in this case represents the rising factorial).

== Hardy–Hille formula ==
The generalized Laguerre polynomials satisfy the Hardy–Hille formula
formula_79
where the series on the left converges for formula_80 and formula_81. Using the identity
formula_82
(see generalized hypergeometric function), this can also be written as
formula_83
This formula is a generalization of the Mehler kernel for Hermite polynomials, which can be recovered from it by using the relations between Laguerre and Hermite polynomials given above.

== Physics Convention ==

The generalized Laguerre polynomials are used to describe the quantum wavefunction for hydrogen atom orbitals. The convention used throughout this article expresses the generalized Laguerre polynomials as 

formula_84

where formula_85 is the confluent hypergeometric function.
In the physics literature, the generalized Laguerre polynomials are instead defined as

formula_86

The physics version is related to the standard version by

formula_87

There is yet another, albeit less frequently used, convention in the physics literature 

formula_88

== Umbral Calculus Convention ==
Generalized Laguerre polynomials are linked to Umbral calculus by being Sheffer sequences for formula_89 when multiplied by formula_90. In Umbral Calculus convention, the default Laguerre polynomials are defined to beformula_91where formula_92 are the signless Lah numbers. formula_93 is a sequence of polynomials of binomial type, &quot;ie&quot; they satisfyformula_94

<text>Callum Keith Rennie (born 14 September 1960) is a British born Canadian actor, based in British Columbia. His breakthrough role was as punk rocker Billy Tallent in the music mockumentary &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; (1996), followed by a starring role as Det. Stanley Raymond Kowalski on the third and fourth seasons of the television series &quot;Due South&quot; (1997–99). He then won a Genie Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance in the Don McKellar film &quot;Last Night&quot; (1998).

Rennie&#x27;s television roles include Leoben Conoy / Number 2 on &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2003–09), Lew Ashby on &quot;Californication&quot; (2008–13), Rick Felder on &quot;The Killing&quot; (2011–12), Gary Connell on &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (2016), Karl Malus on &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2018), and Commander Rayner on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (2024). He won a Gemini Award for Best Actor in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role for his portrayal of Detective Ben Sullivan on &quot;Shattered&quot;, and a second Genie Award for the film &quot;Normal&quot; (2007). He has also won four Leo Awards.

==Early life==
Rennie was born in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear and at age four his family emigrated to Canada. Rennie was brought up in middle-class Edmonton, Alberta, as the second of three boys. He graduated from Strathcona High School, where he met and befriended Bruce McCulloch from the Kids in the Hall. He dropped out of college and took up all sorts of odd jobs, leaving Edmonton for brief stays in Vancouver and Toronto before eventually settling in Vancouver.

==Career==

===Early work===
Working at the campus radio of University of Alberta led Rennie to discover acting at age 25. He started his career on stage, performing at the A.B.O.P. Theatre in Edmonton in &quot;Amerika&quot;, a play adapted from Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel and followed with the critically acclaimed &quot;American Buffalo&quot; during the Edmonton International Fringe Festival. After attending Bruhanski Theatre Studio in Vancouver, he had his first professional theatrical performance in 1989 in Sally Clark&#x27;s &quot;Lost Souls and Missing Persons&quot;, a Touchstone Theatre production. This earned him an invitation to work at the Shaw Festival where he appeared in &quot;Man and Superman&quot; and in Pinero&#x27;s &quot;Trelawny of the Wells&quot; (1990).

===1993–2001===

Rennie&#x27;s first appearance on screen was in the indie Canadian film &quot;Purple Toast&quot;, filmed in 1990 and released in 1993. Also in 1993, he began to take small roles in television (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, and the revamped version of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;). Rennie&#x27;s profile within the Canadian industry was heightened during this period by leading roles in the television films &quot;Paris or Somewhere&quot; (1994) and &quot;For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down&quot; (1996). Due to several disagreements during the production of the latter film, Rennie vowed never to work for the CBC again, though he has remained a staunch supporter of the Canadian industry as a whole. After his first appearance on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, he was offered the role of Alex Krycek but turned it down because he did not want to commit to a television series at that time. 

His career gained momentum quickly and larger roles in Canadian films followed (the independent short film &quot;Frank&#x27;s Cock&quot; by Mike Hoolboom, and Mina Shum&#x27;s &quot;Double Happiness&quot; as Sandra Oh&#x27;s love interest, for which he was nominated for a Genie Award as best supporting actor). He also had more important roles on television series, as in a two-parter for &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;.

His most prominent early roles were as guitar player Billy Tallent in Bruce McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; (1996) and as detective Stanley Raymond Kowalski in the third and fourth seasons of CTV series &quot;Due South&quot;, which aired in over 150 countries. The Canadian band Billy Talent is named after his &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; character. As for his part in &quot;Due South&quot;, it has been said that his &quot;disaffected intensity and hungover good looks&quot; added an edge to the series.

Rennie was then seen in the recurrent roles of the convenience store guru Newbie on Don McKellar&#x27;s cult television series &quot;Twitch City&quot; and of detective Bobby Marlowe on the award-winning series &quot;Da Vinci&#x27;s Inquest&quot;.

His interpretation of sex marathoner Craig Zwiller in Don McKellar&#x27;s &quot;Last Night&quot; earned him his first Genie Award (1999). After a role in David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (1999), his first international success on the big screen was his appearance as the thug Dodd in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Memento&quot; (2000). The same year, he impersonated a chilling yet seductive drifter in &quot;Suspicious River&quot;.

===2002–present===
With the father characters of &quot;Falling Angels&quot; (2003) and &quot;Flower and Garnet&quot; (2002), Rennie expanded to playing more mature roles, rather than young, self-destructive rebels. He also impersonated self-controlled Inspector Wood in the period drama &quot;&quot; (2002) and appeared as the quiet dyslexic painter of &quot;Wilby Wonderful&quot; (2004).

He has played guest roles in episodes of various Canadian or US television series like &quot;Mutant X&quot;, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supernatural&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;Bionic Woman&quot; and more recently &quot;Harper&#x27;s Island&quot;. During the same time, he has interpreted contrasting characters in movies such as &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, &quot;H2O: the Last Prime Minister&quot;, &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven&quot;, &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Lucid&quot; (2005), &quot;Unnatural &amp; Accidental&quot; (2006), &quot;The Invisible&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Silk&quot; (2007), and &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; (2008).

His recurring role as the Cylon Leoben Conoy in the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (2003–09) and his portrayal of the record producer Lew Ashby throughout the second season of &quot;Californication&quot; (2008) have earned him a new wide and international recognition.

In 2009–10, Rennie played a character named Jeff Slingerland aka Dr. Maurice Raynaud on the ABC series &quot;FlashForward&quot;. Before the series was cancelled, David Goyer, who had previously directed him in &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;The Invisible&quot;, mentioned he would be back and was slated to appear in the second season. He also appeared as Russian mobster Vladimir Laitanan in the eighth season of &quot;24&quot;.

In Fall 2010, he played the lead role of Detective Brian Sullivan on &quot;Shattered&quot;, a series about a detective who suffers from multiple personality disorder. It aired in Canada on Global TV, followed by airings in other countries, though not the United States. Rennie received critical acclaim for his performance, and in 2011 won the Gemini and Leo awards for the role. Shattered was not renewed for a second season.

His 2010 appearances on the big screen included the Canadian film &quot;Gunless&quot;, a Western comedy starring Paul Gross, as a bounty hunter on the trail of Gross&#x27; Montana Kid. He also reprised his role as Billy Tallent for a short appearance in &quot;Trigger&quot;. &quot;Trigger&quot; is part of several films set in the same universe as &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;, directed again by Bruce McDonald; this one, starring Molly Parker and Tracy Wright, written by Daniel MacIvor, is about the reunion of two women who used to be in an alternative rock band together. Rennie also served as one of Trigger&#x27;s executive producers. Another film, &quot;Faith, Fraud &amp; Minimum Wage&quot;, based on Canadian playwright Josh MacDonald&#x27;s play &quot;Halo&quot;, has been completed and is waiting for release.

Rennie made a number of television appearances in 2011, including a supporting role on &quot;The Killing&quot; as Rick Felder, Detective Sarah Linden&#x27;s fiancé. He also guest starred on &quot;Alphas&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Rookie Blue&quot;.

Rennie was also cast as a series regular on the NBC series &quot;The Firm&quot;. He plays Ray McDeere, the brother of the principal character, Mitch McDeere, played by Josh Lucas. It began airing as a midseason replacement for the 2011–12 season.

In 2015, Rennie was cast as a main character for the second season of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the High Castle.&quot; He joined the cast in the role of Gary Connell, leader of the West Coast Resistance movement.

==Personal life==
Rennie likes painting and admires abstract expressionist artists such as Basquiat, Motherwell and Pollock (the Champion spark-plug logo tattoo on his right arm is an homage to Stuart Davis). He was an enthusiastic mountain climber in his youth and is an avid golfer.

<text>A fault model is an engineering model of something that could go wrong in the construction or operation of a piece of equipment. From the model, the designer or user can then predict the consequences of this particular fault. Fault models can be used in almost all branches of engineering.

==Basic fault models==
Basic fault models in digital circuits include:
*Static faults, which give incorrect values at any speed and sensitized by performing only one operation:
** the stuck-at fault model. A signal, or gate output, is stuck at a 0 or 1 value, independent of the inputs to the circuit.
** the bridging fault model. Two signals are connected together when they should not be. Depending on the logic circuitry employed, this may result in a &quot;wired-OR&quot; or &quot;wired-AND&quot; logic function. Since there are &quot;O(n^2)&quot; potential bridging faults, they are normally restricted to signals that are physically adjacent in the design.
** the transistor faults. This model is used to describe faults for CMOS logic gates. At transistor level, a transistor maybe stuck-short or stuck-open. In stuck-short, a transistor behaves as it is always conducts (or stuck-on), and stuck-open is when a transistor never conducts current (or stuck-off). Stuck-short will produce a short between VDD and VSS.
** The open fault model. Here a wire is assumed broken, and one or more inputs are disconnected from the output that should drive them. As with bridging faults, the resulting behavior depends on the circuit implementation.
*Dynamic faults, only at-speed and are sensitized by performing multiple operations sequentially:
** The transition delay fault (or transition fault) model, where the signal eventually assumes the correct value, but more slowly (or rarely, more quickly) than normal.
** Small-delay-defect model 
==Fault assumption==
A fault model, falls under one of the following assumptions:
* single fault assumption: only one fault occur in a circuit. if we define k possible fault types in our fault model the circuit has n signal lines, by single fault assumption, the total number of single faults is k×n.
* multiple fault assumption: multiple faults may occur in a circuit.

==Fault collapsing==
There are two main ways for collapsing fault sets into smaller sets.

===Equivalence collapsing===
It is possible that two or more faults produce same faulty behavior for all input patterns. These faults are called equivalent faults. Any single fault from the set of equivalent faults can represent the whole set. In this case, much less than k×n fault tests are required for a circuit with n signal line. removing equivalent faults from entire set of faults is called fault collapsing. fault collapsing significantly decreases the number of faults to check.
In the example diagram, red faults are equivalent to the faults that being pointed to with the arrows, so those red faults can be removed from the circuit. In this case, the fault collapse ratio is 12/20.

===Dominance collapsing===

Fault F is called dominant to F&#x27; if all tests of F&#x27; detects F. In this case, F can be removed from the fault list. If F dominates F&#x27; and F&#x27; dominates F, then these two faults are equivalent.

In the example, a NAND gate has been shown, the set of all input values that can test output&#x27;s SA0 is {00,01,10}. the set of all input values that can check first input&#x27;s SA1 is {01}. In this case, output SA0 fault is dominant and can be removed from fault list.

===Functional collapsing===
Two faults are functionally equivalent if they produce identical faulty functions or we can say, two faults are functionally equivalent if we can not distinguish them at primary outputs (PO) with any input test vector.

== In aerospace contexts ==
A fault model in an aerospace context is a set of structured information which helps users or systems to identify and isolate a problem that occurs on an engine, line-replaceable unit (LRU), or auxiliary power unit (APU) during a flight. Associated with this fault model may be a suggested repair procedure along with references to aircraft maintenance manuals (~ Light maintenance manual).

<text>Mikhail Iosifovich Gurevich () ( – 12 November 1976) was a Soviet aircraft designer who co-founded the Mikoyan-Gurevich military aviation bureau along with Artem Mikoyan. The bureau is famous for its fighter aircraft, rapid interceptors and multi-role combat aircraft which were staples of the Soviet Air Forces throughout the Cold War. The bureau designed 170 projects of which 94 were made in series. In total, 45,000 MiG aircraft have been manufactured domestically, of which 11,000 aircraft were exported. The last plane which Gurevich personally worked on before his retirement was the MiG-25.

==Life and career==

Born to a Jewish family his father was a winery mechanic in the small township of Rubanshchina (Kursk region in Russia). In 1910 he graduated from gymnasium in Okhtyrka (Kharkiv region) with the silver medal and entered the Mathematics department at Kharkiv University. After a year, for participation in revolutionary activities, he was expelled from the university and from the region and continued his education in Montpellier University. He was at SUPAERO in Toulouse in the 1913 class with Marcel Bloch, who later took the name Marcel Dassault.

In the summer 1914 Gurevich was visiting his home when World War I broke out. This and later the Russian Civil War interrupted his education. In 1925 he graduated from the Aviation faculty of Kharkiv Technological Institute and worked as an engineer of the state company &quot;Heat and Power&quot;.

In 1929 Gurevich moved to Moscow to pursue the career of aviation designer. Soviet design was a state-run affair, organised in so-called OKBs or design bureaus. In 1937 Gurevich headed a designer team in the Polikarpov Design Bureau, where he met his future team partner, Artem Mikoyan. In late 1939 they created the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau, with Gurevich in the position of Vice Chief Designer, and after 1957 as its Chief Designer, a post he kept until his retirement in 1964. This is remarkable, considering that he never joined the Communist Party.
In 1940 Mikoyan and Gurevich designed and built the high-altitude MiG-1 fighter plane, starting from a project partially developed by Polikarpov&#x27;s team. The improved MiG-3 fighter aircraft was widely used during World War II. In the years after the war, the two designed the first Soviet jet fighters, including the first supersonic models. The last model Gurevich worked on was the MiG-25 interceptor, which is among the fastest military aircraft ever to enter service.

==Honours and awards==
* Hero of Socialist Labor (1957)
* Six State Stalin Prizes (1941, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1953)
* Order of Lenin (1962)

<text>Siberia, also known as Siberian Craton, Angaraland (or simply Angara) and Angarida, is an ancient craton in the heart of Siberia. Today forming the Central Siberian Plateau, it formed an independent landmass prior to its fusion into Pangea during the Late Carboniferous-Permian. The Verkhoyansk Sea, a passive continental margin, was fringing the Siberian Craton to the east in what is now the East Siberian Lowland.

Angaraland was named in the 1880s by Austrian geologist Eduard Suess who erroneously believed that in the Paleozoic Era there were two large continents in the Northern Hemisphere: &quot;Atlantis&quot;, which was North America connected to Europe via a peninsula (Greenland and Iceland), and &quot;Angara-land&quot;, which would have been eastern Asia, named after the Angara River in Siberia.

==Precambrian history==
About 2.5 billion years ago (in the Siderian Period), Siberia was part of a continent called Arctica, along with the Canadian Shield. Around 1.1 billion years ago (in the Stenian Period), Siberia became part of the supercontinent of Rodinia, a state of affairs which lasted until the Tonian about 750 million years ago when it broke up, and Siberia became part of the landmass of Protolaurasia. During the Ediacaran Period around 600 million years ago, Protolaurasia became part of the southern supercontinent of Pannotia but around 550 million years ago, both Pannotia and Protolaurasia split up to become the continents of Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia.

==Paleozoic history==

Siberia was an independent continent through the early Paleozoic until, during the Carboniferous Period, it collided with the minor continent of Kazakhstania. A subsequent collision with Euramerica/Laurussia during the Late Carboniferous-Permian formed Pangea.

==Mesozoic and Cenozoic history==
Pangaea split up during the Jurassic though Siberia stayed with Laurasia. Laurasia gradually split up during the Cretaceous with Siberia remaining part of present-day northeastern Eurasia. Today, Siberia forms part of the landmass of Afro-Eurasia. To the east it is joined to the North American Plate at the Chersky Range. In around 250 million years from now Siberia may be in the subtropical region and part of the new supercontinent of Pangaea Proxima.

The term has also been used for specific naval vessels (see USS &quot;Vedette&quot;), and a class of flying boat (see Canadian Vickers Vedette).

==Structures==
All around Salisbury Plain in southern England, the roads connecting the plain with the surrounding countryside feature brick-built guard-posts, staffed by security officers whenever there is military activity beyond such points. They are known as vedettes, and each one is named for a local geographic feature.

The &quot;Gardjola&quot; is a prominent guard tower on Maltese forts in Malta and an example of a vedette. It may be referred to in French as an &quot;échauguette&quot;.

<text>Gordon Edward Pinsent (July 12, 1930 – February 25, 2023) was a Canadian actor, writer, director, and singer. He was known for his roles in numerous productions, including &quot;Away from Her&quot;, &quot;The Rowdyman&quot;, &quot;John and the Missus&quot;, &quot;A Gift to Last&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, and &quot;Quentin Durgens, M.P.&quot; He was the voice of King Babar in the Babar the Elephant television and film productions from 1989 to 2015.
==Early life==
Pinsent, the youngest of six children, was born in Grand Falls, Newfoundland (present-day Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada). His mother, Florence &quot;Flossie&quot; (née Cooper), was originally from Clifton, Newfoundland and his father, Stephen Arthur Pinsent, was a papermill worker and cobbler originally from Dildo, Newfoundland. His mother was &quot;quiet spoken&quot; and a religious Anglican; the family was descended from immigrants from Kent and Devon in England. He was a self-described &quot;awkward child&quot; who suffered from rickets.

Pinsent began acting on stage in the 1940s at the age of 17. He soon took on roles in radio drama on the CBC, and later moved into television and film as well. In the early 1950s, he took a break from acting and joined the Canadian Army, serving for approximately four years as a private in the Royal Canadian Regiment.

==Career==
Pinsent&#x27;s professional acting career began in 1957 at Winnipeg&#x27;s Theatre 77 (later known as the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre) under the direction of John Hirsch. In the years that followed, he performed in many theatrical productions in Winnipeg, Toronto and at the Stratford Festival.

In the early 1960s, he appeared in &quot;Scarlett Hill&quot; and &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot;. He later became a staple of Canadian television with roles including the series &quot;Quentin Durgens, M.P.&quot;, &quot;A Gift to Last&quot; (which he created), &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;, &quot;Due South&quot;, &quot;Wind at My Back&quot;, and &quot;Power Play&quot;.

Pinsent&#x27;s film roles include &quot;The Rowdyman&quot;, &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind&quot;, &quot;John and the Missus&quot;, &quot;The Shipping News&quot; and &quot;Away from Her&quot;. He wrote the screenplays for &quot;The Rowdyman&quot; and &quot;John and the Missus&quot;. Perhaps his best known early film role was that of the president of the United States in the 1970 science fiction cult classic &quot;&quot;. His other plays include &quot;Easy Down Easy&quot; (1987) and &quot;Brass Rubbings&quot; (1989).

One of Pinsent&#x27;s largest roles was playing the character of Hap Shaughnessy on &quot;The Red Green Show&quot; from 1991 to 2006. Hap was notorious for telling largely exaggerated stories about his past. He was frequently called out on his fabrications by his friend Red Green (played by Canadian comedian and show co-creator Steve Smith) or others.

His first memoir, &quot;By the Way&quot;, was published in 1992 by Stoddart Publishing. His second, &quot;Next&quot; (with George Anthony), was published in 2012 by McClelland and Stewart.

On March 8, 2007, it was publicly announced in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that Pinsent had accepted the appointment of honorary chairman of the &quot;Building for the Future&quot; fundraising campaign for The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum.

During the 2008, 2010, and 2011 summer periods of CBC Radio One, Pinsent presented a radio documentary series called &quot;The Late Show&quot; featuring extended obituaries of notable Canadians whom the producers believed deserved attention.

Pinsent appeared in one of Canadian director Stephen Dunn&#x27;s early short films titled &quot;Life Doesn&#x27;t Frighten Me&quot;, which won various awards, including the CBC Short Film Face-Off, with a cash prize of C$30,000. The film also won awards at the Toronto Student Film Festival and the Tribeca Film Festival in 2013.

He had a guest starring role as Maurice Becker on the February 3, 2010, episode of Canadian television series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;. He was also a featured guest reader on Bookaboo.

He attained notoriety when a comedic segment of him reading dramatically from Justin Bieber&#x27;s autobiography on &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; went viral on October 20, 2010.

== Personal life and death ==
Pinsent married actress Charmion King in 1962. They remained together until her death in 2007. Their daughter, Leah Pinsent, is also an actress. Pinsent also has two children, Barry and Beverley, from a previous marriage.

On February 25, 2023, Pinsent died at a hospital in Toronto at age 92, from complications of a cerebral hemorrhage.

==Awards==
In 1979, he was made an officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1998. In 2006, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 2007, it was announced that Pinsent would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

In 1997, he won the Earle Grey Award for lifetime achievement in television.

Pinsent received an LL.D from the University of Prince Edward Island in 1975, and honorary doctorates from Queen&#x27;s University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Lakehead University (2008) and the University of Windsor (2012).

Pinsent received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award in 2004, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts.

It was on July 12, 2005, in his hometown of Grand Falls-Windsor, and in honour of his 75th birthday, that the Arts &amp; Culture Centre was renamed The Gordon Pinsent Centre for the Arts.

On September 25, 2008, at a &quot;Newfoundland- and Labrador-Inspired Evening&quot; at The Windsor Arms Hotel in Toronto, the Company Theatre presented Pinsent with the inaugural Gordon Pinsent Award of Excellence.

Pinsent received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.

Pinsent received acting and writing awards, which included five Gemini Awards, three Genie Awards, two ACTRA Awards, and a Dora Award.

<text>Resolution enhancement technology (RET) is a form of image processing technology used to manipulate dot characteristics popular among laser printer and inkjet printer manufacturers. Closely related RET techniques are also used in VLSI photolithography manufacturing technology, in particular in relation to 90 nanometre technology.

Resolution refers to the sharpness of image detail, smoothness of curved lines, and the faithful reproduction of an image. In both cases, RET uses pre-compensation of the image in order to try to mitigate the effects of the printing process. 

Among the major issues in RET in VLSI technology are the fundamental properties of a wave: amplitude, phase, and direction.

<text>Plant Heritage, formerly known as the National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens (NCCPG), is a registered charity and a botanical conservation organisation in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1978 to combine the talents of botanists, horticulturalists and conservationists with the dedication of keen amateur and professional gardeners. The mission statement of the organisation declares that &quot;The NCCPG seeks to conserve, document, promote and make available Britain and Ireland&#x27;s rich biodiversity of garden plants for the benefit of everyone through horticulture, education and science.&quot; Specifically, the aims of the organisation are to:

* encourage the propagation and conservation of endangered garden plants in the British Isles, both species and cultivars; 
* encourage and conduct research into cultivated plants, their origins, their historical and cultural importance and their environments; and
* encourage the education of the public in garden plant conservation.

Through its membership and the National Plant Collection holders, Plant Heritage seeks to rediscover and reintroduce endangered garden plants by encouraging their propagation and distribution so that they are grown as widely as possible. The charity works closely with other conservation bodies such as botanic gardens, the National Trust, the National Trust for Scotland, English Heritage, the Royal Horticultural Society and many specialist horticultural societies.

Plant Heritage&#x27;s patron is The Prince of Wales.

In 2010, the television gardener Alan Titchmarsh became president of the charity.

<text>Robert Anthony Stone (August 21, 1937 – January 10, 2015) was an American novelist, journalist, and college professor.

He was five times a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction, which he did receive in 1975 for his novel &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included this novel in its list &quot;100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;. Stone was also twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and once for the PEN/Faulkner Award.

During his lifetime Stone received material support and recognition including Guggenheim and National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships, the five-year Mildred and Harold Strauss Living Award, the John Dos Passos Prize for Literature, and the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award. Stone also offered his own support and recognition of writers during his lifetime, serving as Chairman of the PEN/Faulkner Foundation Board of Directors for over thirty years.

Stone&#x27;s best known work is characterized by action-tinged adventures, political concerns and dark humor. Many of his novels are set in unusual, exotic landscapes of raging social turbulence, such as the Vietnam War; a post-coup violent banana republic in Central America; Jim Crow-era New Orleans, and Jerusalem on the verge of the millennium.

==Life==
Stone was born in Brooklyn, New York on August 21, 1937 to Homer Stone, who worked for the New Haven Railroad, and Gladys Grant, a teacher. Stone&#x27;s parents separated when he was an infant. Stone came from a &quot;family of Scottish Presbyterians and Irish Catholics who made their living as tugboat workers in New York harbor&quot;. Until the age of six he was raised primarily by his mother, who suffered from schizophrenia; after she was institutionalized, he spent several years in a Catholic orphanage. In his short story &quot;Absence of Mercy&quot;, which he has called autobiographical, the protagonist Mackay is placed at age five in an orphanage described as having had &quot;the social dynamic of a coral reef&quot;.

Stone was expelled from a Marist high school during his senior year for &quot;drinking too much beer and being &#x27;militantly atheistic&#x27;&quot;. Soon afterwards, Stone joined the Navy for four years. At sea he traveled to many locales, including Antarctica and Egypt. But according to Stone, it was his first shore leave in a pre-Fidel Castro era Havana, Cuba that impacted his future writing:
In the early 1960s, he briefly attended New York University; worked as a copy boy at the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;; married and moved to New Orleans; and held the Stegner Fellowship (1962-1963) at the Stanford University Creative Writing Center, where he began writing a novel. Although he associated with the influential post-Beat Generation writer Ken Kesey and other Merry Pranksters, he was not a passenger on the famous 1964 bus trip to New York, contrary to some media reports. Living in New York at the time, he met the bus on its arrival and accompanied Kesey to an &quot;after-bus party&quot; whose attendees included a dyspeptic Jack Kerouac.

Although he never completed an academic degree, Stone taught in the creative writing programs at various university programs around the United States. He held a lectureship at the Johns Hopkins University Writing Seminars during the 1993–1994 academic year before moving to Yale University. He taught creative writing for the academic year 2006–2007 at Beloit College. For the 2010–2011 academic year, Stone held an endowed chair in the English department at Texas State University. He was also active in many of the writing seminars in and around Key West, Florida where he resided during the winter months. Stone was appointed an honorary director of the Key West Literary Seminar serving in that capacity during the final decade of his life.

Stone was a heavy smoker, but quit in his 40s. However, at age 72, just after the publication of his second short-story collection &quot;Fun With Problems&quot;, Stone admitted that he suffered from severe emphysema: &quot;It&#x27;s my punishment for chain-smoking,&quot; he says. He recalled his reaction to being told of the harm smoking was now causing him in old age: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to know I&#x27;m alive!&quot;.

According to his literary agent, Neil Olson, Stone died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on January 10, 2015, in Key West, where he and his wife had spent their winters for more than twenty years. He was 77. At the time of his death, Stone was survived by his wife of 55 years, Janice, and their two adult-age children, a daughter named Deirdre and a son named Ian.

==Publications==
During his lifetime, Robert Stone published eight novels, two story collections, and a memoir, &quot;Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties&quot;. Since his death, a book of collected nonfiction has appeared, and a volume of his work (reprinting together &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;, &quot;A Flag For Sunrise&quot;, and &quot;Outerbridge Reach&quot;) has been included in the aclaimed Library of America series. 

=== Fiction ===
Stone&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Hall of Mirrors&quot;, appeared in 1967. It won both a Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship, and a William Faulkner Foundation Award for best first novel. Set in New Orleans in 1960 and based partly on actual events, the novel depicted a political scene dominated by right-wing racism, but its style was more reminiscent of Beat writers than of earlier social realists: alternating between naturalism and stream of consciousness. It was adapted as a film, &quot;WUSA&quot; (1970) based on Stone&#x27;s screenplay of his own novel. The novel&#x27;s success led to a Guggenheim Fellowship and began Stone&#x27;s career as a professional writer.

In 1971 he traveled to Vietnam as a correspondent for an obscure British journal called &quot;INK&quot;. His time there served as the inspiration for his second novel, &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; (1974), which features a journalist smuggling heroin from Vietnam. It shared the 1975 U.S. National Book Award with &quot;The Hair of Harold Roux&quot; by Thomas Williams. &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; was adapted into the film &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; (1978) starring Nick Nolte, from a script that Stone co-wrote.

Stone&#x27;s third book, &quot;A Flag for Sunrise&quot; (1981), was published to unanimous critical praise and moderate commercial success. The story follows a wide cast of characters as their paths intersect in a fictionalized banana republic based on Nicaragua. The novel was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and the Pulitzer Prize. &quot;A Flag for Sunrise&quot; was twice a finalist for the National Book Award, once following its hardcover release and again the next year when it was reissued in paperback.

In contrast to the grand, somewhat satirical adventure epics Stone is commonly associated with, his next two novels were smaller-scale character studies: the misfortunate tale of a Hollywood movie actress in &quot;Children of Light&quot;, and an eccentric at the midst of a circumnavigation race in &quot;Outerbridge Reach&quot; (based loosely on the story of Donald Crowhurst), published in 1986 and 1992 respectively. The latter was a finalist for the National Book Award for 1992. &quot;Bear and His Daughter&quot;, published in 1997, is a short story collection. It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1998.

Stone returned to the complex political novel with &quot;Damascus Gate&quot; (1998), about a man with messianic delusions caught up in a terrorist plot in Jerusalem. The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award for 1998. It was followed in 2003 by &quot;Bay of Souls.&quot; The final novel that Stone published in his lifetime was &quot;Death of the Black-Haired Girl&quot; which appeared in 2013.

=== Nonfiction ===
&quot;Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties&quot; (2007) is Stone&#x27;s memoir discussing his experiences in the 1960s counterculture. &quot;Pleasant goofing&quot; was the way Stone described those days in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview from 1981. This autobiographical work begins with his days in the Navy and ends with his days as a correspondent in Vietnam. Besides Ken Kesey, this work features Stone&#x27;s insights on Neal Cassady, Allen Ginsberg, and Jack Kerouac from his time spent traveling with them. &quot;Prime Green&quot; also gives us Stone&#x27;s perspective on drugs and their effects. Following his death in 2015, a critic noted, in a snapshot retrospective view of Stone&#x27;s career, that &quot;even his experiments with drugs in the early sixties led Stone to understand that his view on life is going to remain religious no matter what.&quot; And Stone himself confirmed this view, when he told the Washington Post in 1981:

<doc id="943953" wikidata="Q1322713" url="?curid=943953" title="1991 Rugby World Cup">
<text>The 1991 Rugby World Cup () was the second edition of the Rugby World Cup, and was jointly hosted by England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France: at the time, the five European countries who participated in the Five Nations Championship. This was the first Rugby World Cup to be staged in the northern hemisphere, with England the hosts of the final. Also for the first time, qualifying competitions were introduced as the number of entrants had increased, from 16 nations four years earlier, to 33 countries. The eight quarter-finalists from 1987 qualified automatically with the remaining eight spots contested through qualifiers by 25 countries. This resulted in only one new side qualifying for the tournament, Western Samoa replacing Tonga. The same 16-team pool/knock-out format was used with just minor changes to the points system. South Africa was again not included because of sanctions imposed on the country by the International Rugby Board (IRB), due to the government&#x27;s apartheid policies.

The pool stages produced a major upset when Western Samoa, who were making their debut in the tournament, defeated the 1987 semi-finalists Wales 16–13 in Cardiff. Along with the other results in the group, this led to the elimination of Wales, who finished third in Pool 3. Also notable in pool play was that Canada finished second in their pool to qualify for the quarter-finals, which remains their best performance in the World Cup. Fiji, as quarter-finalists four years earlier, had expected to occupy that position, but after the upset loss to Canada and a hammering by France, they lost even their final match against the unfancied Romanian team. Earlier, the opening match had pitted the holders New Zealand against the hosts England: New Zealand overturned a narrow half-time deficit to win the match and the pool, both teams qualifying for the quarter-finals with easy victories in their other matches. Scotland beat Ireland to top their pool, again both teams qualifying.

In the quarter-finals, neither Canada nor Western Samoa proved a match for New Zealand or Scotland, respectively. Meanwhile, England knocked out 1987 finalist France in a bruising encounter. Australia pipped Ireland 19–18 in a thrilling match at Lansdowne Road, with a last-gasp try from fly-half Michael Lynagh coming after the Irish took an unexpected 18–15 lead. The semi-finals produced two tight matches: England overcame Scotland 9–6, a late drop goal deciding a tryless match in a torrential downpour at Murrayfield Stadium, and Australia defeated the defending champions New Zealand 16–6 at Lansdowne Road.

The final was played at Twickenham Stadium in London, and saw Australia triumph 12–6 against England, with a first-half try from prop Tony Daly.

==Qualification==

The following 16 teams, shown by region, qualified for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Of the 16 teams, eight of those places were automatically filled by quarter-finalists from the 1987 World Cup and did not have to play any qualification matches. 25 nations competed in a qualification process designed to fill the remaining eight spots, bringing the total participation to 33 nations. In the event, there was only one change from the 1987 tournament, with Western Samoa appearing in place of Tonga.

==Venues==

==Squads==
==Referees==
==Format==

As in the 1987 Rugby World Cup the 16 nations were divided into four pools of four nations, with each nation playing their other pool opponents once, every nation playing three times during the pool stages. Nations were awarded 2 points for a win, 1 for a draw and zero for a loss, the top two nations of every pool advanced to the quarter-finals. The runners-up of each pool faced the winners of a different pool in the quarter-finals. The winners moved on to the semi-finals, with the winners then moving onto the final, and the losers of the semi-finals contesting a third/fourth place play off.

*Pool 1 was played in England
*Pool 2 was played in both Scotland and Ireland, with matches played in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
*Pool 3 was played in Wales
*Pool 4 was played in France

Points system

The points system that was used in the pool stage was which was changed from 1987 was as follows: 
*3 points for a win
*2 points for a draw
*1 point for playing

A total of 32 matches (24 in the pool stage and eight in the knock-out stage) were played throughout the tournament over 30 days from 3 October 1991 to 2 November 1991.

==Broadcasters==
The event was broadcast in the United Kingdom by ITV who took over the rights from the BBC. 13 million people in the United Kingdom watched the final. In Australia it was the second and the last (as of the 2023 tournament) Rugby World Cup to be broadcast on ABC television as, from 1995, the commercial networks 7, 9 and 10 would all take over the broadcast rights sometimes in partnership with pay and streaming broadcasters Fox and Stan. In New Zealand, it was broadcast by TVNZ. In France, it was broadcast by TF1 instead of France&#x27;s traditional Rugby broadcasters Antenne2. In Ireland it was broadcast by RTÉ. ITV, TF1 and RTE were the host broadcasters broadcasting the pictures around the world as well to their own countries.

<text>Anthony Alexander Poshepny (September 18, 1924 – June 27, 2003), known as Tony Poe, was an American CIA Paramilitary Operations Officer in what became the Special Activities Division (renamed Special Activities Center in 2016). He was known for controversial actions during his service in Laos with Special Guerilla Units (SGUs) under the command of General Vang Pao, a U.S.-funded secret army in Laos during the Vietnam War, and is recognized as the possible primary inspiration for Colonel Kurtz in the movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;. 

==Early life and career==
Poshepny was born September 18, 1924, in Long Beach, California, to John Charles and Isabel M. ( Veriziano) Poshepny. His father was a United States Navy officer whose parents were immigrants from Bohemia. His mother was born in Guam. When he was eight years old, his nine-year-old brother John accidentally shot him in the stomach with the family rifle, and he nearly bled to death.

Shortly after turning 18, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, serving in the 2nd Marine Parachute Battalion and fighting in the 5th Marine Division on Iwo Jima.

He received the Purple Heart twice and was a Sergeant by the time he was honorably discharged. Returning to civilian life, he enrolled at Saint Mary&#x27;s College, before transferring to what is now San Jose State University. He contemplated going to work for the FBI. Graduating in 1950, he instead joined the CIA, where he was part of the first recruit class to receive all of its training at the new Camp Peary. He was active in Korea during the Korean War, training refugees for sabotage missions in the North. He also trained anti-Communist forces for missions against China.

Following the Korean war, Poshepny joined the Bangkok-based CIA front company Overseas Southeast Asia Supply (SEA Supply), which provided military equipment to Kuomintang forces based in Burma. In 1958, Poshepny tried unsuccessfully to arrange a military uprising against Sukarno, the president of Indonesia. From 1958 to 1960, he trained different groups, including Tibetan Khampas and Hui Muslims at Camp Hale for anti-government operations inside China. Carole McGranahan quotes Poe from an interview that the Tibetans he trained &quot;... were the best I ever worked with.&quot;

==Laos==
The CIA awarded Poshepny the Intelligence Star in 1959. Two years later, working under James William Lair, he was assigned with J. Vinton Lawrence to train Hmong hill tribes in Laos to fight against the North Vietnamese forces and the Pathet Lao. Poshepny&#x27;s practices were described as barbaric when they later came to light. He paid Hmong fighters to bring him the ears of dead enemy soldiers, and on at least one occasion mailed a bag of ears to the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane to verify his body counts. He dropped severed heads onto enemy locations twice in a grisly psy-op. The CIA eventually extracted Poshepny from Laos in 1970 and assigned him to a training camp in Thailand until his retirement in 1974. He received another Intelligence Star in 1975.

==Retirement and death==
After the United States withdrew from Vietnam, Poshepny remained in Thailand with his Hmong wife and four children. He moved the family to California in the 1990s. He frequently appeared at Hmong veterans&#x27; gatherings and helped veterans immigrate and settle in the US. He defended his controversial acts during the war to reporters and historians, claiming they were necessary response to fight the war. He died in California on June 27, 2003, aged 78. Prior to his death, he had joined others in calling for a memorial to the Hmong who had fought in Laos; the memorial was ultimately established in Arlington National Cemetery in 2018. An exhibit about Poshepny is on display at the Patpong Museum in Bangkok, Thailand.

A number of press stories have implied that Poshepny was the model for Colonel Walter Kurtz in the film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, though director Francis Ford Coppola has denied this, citing Robert B. Rheault as the actual inspiration.

<text>Casualty movement is the collective term for the techniques used to move a casualty from the initial location (street, home, workplace, wilderness, battlefield) to the ambulance.

In wilderness or combat conditions, it may first be necessary to stabilize the patient prior to moving them to avoid causing further injury. In such situations, evacuation may involve carrying the victim some distance on improvised stretchers, a travois, or other improvised carrying gear.

Spinal immobilization is necessary if there is a likelihood of head or spinal injury.

Once the patient is ready to be moved, the first step is the casualty lifting, to put him/her on a stretcher or litter (rescue basket). The final step is the patient transfer from the stretcher to the hospital bed.

The use of wheeled stretchers, usually used in most developed emergency services, does not need much explanation, except that great care must be taken in order to avoid aggravating an unstable trauma.

<text>Shirley Jean Douglas (April 2, 1934 – April 5, 2020) was a Canadian actress. Her acting career combined with her family name made her recognisable in Canadian film, television and national politics.

==Early life==
Douglas was born April 2, 1934, in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, the daughter of Irma May (née Dempsey; 1911–1995) and Tommy Douglas (1904–1986), the late Scottish-born Canadian statesman, Premier of Saskatchewan and the first leader of the federal New Democratic Party. She attended high school at Central Collegiate Institute (later closed) in Regina. Douglas attended the Banff School of Fine Arts at the age of 16.

==Career==

Douglas&#x27;s acting career began in 1950 with a role in the Regina Little Theatre entry at the Dominion Drama Festival, where she won the best actress award. In 1952 Shirley graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and stayed in England for several years, performing for theatre and television, before returning to Canada in 1957.

She continued to act; and her career encompassed several memorable roles on stages in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. She portrayed prominent feminist Nellie McClung, family matriarch and business woman May Bailey in the television series &quot;Wind at My Back&quot;, Hagar Shipley in Margaret Laurence&#x27;s &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;, and even characters in popular science fiction series like &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;.

In 1997, Douglas appeared on stage with her son Kiefer Sutherland at the Royal Alexandra Theatre and at the National Arts Centre in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;. In 2000, she performed on stage in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In 2006, she portrayed former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the ABC mini-series &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;.

In 2003, for her contributions to the performing arts, she was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Personal life and death==
Douglas was the mother of three children: Thomas Emil Sick from her marriage to Canadian prairie brewery heir Timothy Emil Sicks in 1957, and twins Rachel Sutherland and Kiefer Sutherland from her second marriage to Canadian actor Donald Sutherland (1966–70).

By 2009, Douglas was in a wheelchair due to a degenerative spine condition that caused her severe pain.

Douglas died on April 5, 2020, due to complications from pneumonia, three days after her 86th birthday.

===Activism===
Douglas moved to Los Angeles, California in 1967 after marrying actor Donald Sutherland. She became involved in the American Civil Rights Movement, the campaign against the Vietnam War, and later on behalf of immigrants and women. She helped establish the fundraising group &quot;Friends of the Black Panthers&quot;.

In 1969, she was arrested in Los Angeles for Conspiracy to Possess Unregistered Explosives. According to a sworn statement by FBI agents, she allegedly attempted to purchase hand grenades from those FBI agents for the Black Panthers using a personal cheque. As her defence, she claimed the FBI was framing her by creating a crime where none existed prior to their involvement. Subsequently, the FBI denied her a work permit based on this allegation. Douglas, by then divorced from Sutherland, left the USA in 1977. She and her three children moved to Toronto. The courts eventually dismissed the case and exonerated her.

Douglas co-founded the first chapter in Canada of the Performing Artists for Nuclear Disarmament.

As the daughter of Tommy Douglas, promoter of Medicare, she was one of Canada&#x27;s activists in favour of taxpayer funded health care instead of privatised care. In the 2006 Canadian federal election, Douglas campaigned on behalf of the federal New Democratic Party and in 2012 she supported Brian Topp for that party&#x27;s leadership.

<doc id="943963" wikidata="Q1122553" url="?curid=943963" title="Färjestad BK">
<text>Färjestad Bollklubb (; abbreviated as FBK) is a Swedish professional ice hockey team based in Karlstad. 

Färjestad has had 21 Swedish Championship final appearances, winning ten times since the Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien) was started in 1975, making them the most successful SHL club in history. The team plays in the highest Swedish league and have done so since 1965. Following Brynäs IF&#x27;s relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan in 2023, Färjestad is the only team to have constantly played in the current top tier of Swedish hockey, the SHL, since it was started in 1975. They reached the SHL championship finals for six consecutive seasons (2001–2006), winning the championship two times. They are featured rivals with Djurgårdens IF, Frölunda HC, and HV71.

==History==
Färjestad BK was founded on 10 November 1932 at Håfström Kiosk in the district of Färjestad in Karlstad by Sven Bryhske, Gösta Jonsson, Sven Larsson and Erik Myren. Initially the association&#x27;s main sport was bandy, which is still reflected in the full name of the club. Ice hockey was first included in 1956.

In 1965, Färjestad were promoted to the top division (at that time Division 1 Southern) which they succeeded in winning for the first time in 1973. During the 1974/75 season, Färjestad qualified for the first season of Elitserien, and have since never been relegated.

In 2014, Färjestad BK played in the 2014 AHL All Star Game in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland against a team of AHL All Stars. In the skills contest, Färjestad lost 18-17 against the All Stars on a Tuesday evening at Mile One Center. In the AHL All-Star Game, Färjestad lost again to the AHL All Stars 7-2 with a sold out crowd the following evening.

<doc id="943964" wikidata="Q3424312" url="?curid=943964" title="Casualty lifting">
<text>Casualty lifting is the first step of casualty movement, an early aspect of emergency medical care. It is the procedure used to put the casualty (the patient) on a stretcher.

Developed emergency services use lifting devices, such as scoop stretchers, that allow secured lifting with minimal personnel. Other methods (explained below) can be used when such devices are not available.

Since only stabilised casualties are moved (except in unusual circumstances), the lifting is usually never performed in emergency; emergency movements are sometimes performed to respect the Golden Hour. This depends on the organisation of the medical services and on the specific circumstances.

Maximum care must be taken to avoid to worsen an unstable trauma. The head-neck-chest axis must be kept straight to protect the spine, and the first responders must keep the patient&#x27;s body stable (no movement of the feet) during the lift.

The first responders have to carry a heavy load (probably more than 20 kg for an adult casualty) in an uncomfortable position. There is thus a risk of injury to the carrier, especially of the lumbar back. To avoid an injury, they must push with their legs (quadriceps), trying to keep their back straight.

==Preparation of the stretcher==
The stretcher must be unfolded, and the hinges secured and tested: a first responder presses the cloth with their knee at several points.
When a vacuum mattress is used, it must be put on the stretcher, and the balls must be evenly distributed.
A blanket is often used since hypothermia is a major risk for a casualty. The blanket must be wrapped around the casualty to avoid the heat leak from below (this is not necessary when the stretcher has a mattress, e.g. a vacuum mattress, or in case of an ambulance stretcher). For this purpose, the blanket is put before the lifting, and folded in a specific way:
# the blanket is laid so the diagonal is along the axis of the stretcher;
# the corners are put on the centre of the stretcher;
# the folded part are then rolled towards the stretcher;
# the rolls are then put under the blanket, so they will not unroll spontaneously; the corners are sticking out so they can be pulled.

==Scoop stretcher==

The use of a scoop stretcher allows a secure lifting with only two team members even in case of a spinal trauma. The use of this device is thus recommended for most operations.

However, in many situations, there is a lack not of people but of devices. Additionally, the scoop stretcher does not allow to maintain the legs up or a half-seated position for the casualty. For these reasons, the other methods are still taught.

==Vertical lift (straddle lift)==

===With five team members===


The most secured way to put a casualty on a stretcher is to use a vertical lift with five first responders including the chief (the procedure is called in French, refers to a gantry, means &quot;enhanced&quot;). The casualty is lifted by four first responders:
# the chief has one knee down, one knee up, and holds the head; they can hold it by sliding the finger under the head, the palm placed on each side of the head; or they can place one hand under the neck and hold the occiput, the other hand under the chin;
# the first team member supports themself on the shoulder of another team member, and steps over the casualty; they put their hands under the shoulders;
# the second team member supports themself on the shoulder of another team member, and steps over the casualty; they put their hands under the hip;
# the third team member hold the ankles;
# the fourth team member pushes the stretcher.
The feet of the team members must be enough spaced so the stretcher can slide in between. If the chief uses the occipital-chin grip, the knee that is up is the knee on the side of the hand under the neck: as this arm supports the heaviest weight, it can supports itself on the knee.

Another method consists in placing the team members at both sides of the casualty and holding the cloths. The cloths must be strong enough.

On the order of the chief, the casualty is lifted, the stretcher is pushed, and the casualty is put down on the stretcher. During this procedure, the chief remains kneeling (stable); the other team members lift pushing with their legs (arms stretched out, back kept straight). Then, the first and second team members pull back, supporting themselves on the shoulder of a still standing member.

With this method, the movement of the casualty is minimal, just vertical.

When there is no room at the feet of the casualty for the stretcher, it must then be placed on the side of the head. The chief must then kneel aside. If he uses the occipital-chin grip, the hand under the neck must be the closest to the casualty&#x27;s feet; the same knee is up.

===With four team members===
With only four first responders, it is necessary to use a &quot;simple&quot; lift ( in French): the chief plays the role of the first team member, stepping over the casualty and placing one hand under the neck, the other hand under the back, between the shoulder blades. The stretcher can come from the feet or from the head. This method is not adapted in case of suspicion of a spine trauma.

===With two team members===
When the casualty has no specific trauma, it is possible to slide a long spine board little by little. A team member lifts a part of the body (head, then shoulders, then hips), and the other one slide the board.

===Lifting with a strap===
A handling strap can help the lifting. The strap for this use should be long, at least wide to share out the weight and avoid the pain, and resist at least to a weight of .

The strap is slid under the casualty: the flat profile can slide easily under the back and the pelvis without lifting the casualty. This strap will form two handles, thus, the team member at the pelvis will have a better grip and a vertical back; the strap crosses in the middle of the back, thus the team member at the head (lifting with four team members) or at the shoulders (lifting with five team members) does not have to put their arms between the shoulder blades, and can then lift with a vertical back. The verticality of the back of the team members is particularly important in case of an overweight casualty.

The strap can be put with two method:
* when the hollow of the back (just above the pelvis) is small (left picture), then the strap is slid in this hollow until its middle; then, each end is slid under the neck, the two branches of the strap are slid under the back, then the middle part is slid under the buttock;
* when the hollow of the back is enough high (right picture): the strap is folded in three, then slid in under the hollow of the back; the two extremities are slid towards the shoulders, and the middle part is slid under the buttocks.
Then, one extremity of the strap goes on a shoulder of the team member and under their opposite armpit (it crosses the back), and is tied to the other or held together by the team member; a hand is also put under the neck to support the head.

==Translation lift==


The translation lift, or &quot;Dutch&quot; lift, is used when it is not possible to push the stretcher: there no room for the stretcher at the feet or head of the casualty, or the stretcher cannot slide/roll on the ground, or there are not enough first responders available. In such a case, the stretcher is placed besides the casualty.

With four first responders (including the chief), the first and second team members step over the casualty and the stretcher, the foot is on the farthest pole of the stretcher. The chief holds the closest pole with their knee on the ground, and the third team member with their ankle. The positions of the hands are the same as for the vertical lift with five first responders.

The first in place is the chief. The stretcher is slid besides the casualty, the pole against the thigh of the chief. Then, the third team member takes place. Once the both extremities of the pole are blocked, the other team members can step over the casualty (one by one, holding the others&#x27; shoulder to avoid falling) without any risk of rocking for the stretcher.

On the order of the chief, the casualty is lifted and translated on the stretcher.

This method can be performed with only three first responders. In this case, the chief plays the role of the first team member; blocking the pole with their ankle, and putting one hand under the neck, the other one under the back, between the shoulder blades. Only the team member at the hips steps over the stretcher.

==Rolling methods (log roll)==



The rolling methods can only be used on a casualty who does not have an unstable trauma. They are especially helpful for heavy weighted casualties: the rolling does not require much effort, and the lifting itself is done in a more comfortable position (the back of the first responders is vertical). They are also interesting when the casualty is in a very narrow place such as a pit or a ditch: the rolling allows sliding the lifting device (board, flexible stretcher, halves of the scoop stretcher).

The rolling methods consist in rolling the casualty on their side; it is then possible:
* to put a long spine board against their back, then to roll back the casualty on their back;
* to slide a folded flexible stretcher (or a blanket); the casualty is then rolled on the other side to unfold the flexible stretcher.
The casualty can then be lifted with the handles of the long spine board or of the flexible stretcher (or holding the rolled sides of the blanket), and put on the stretcher.

Usually, the method is done with four first responders, including the chief:
# the chief is kneeling at the head, in the axis of the casualty, and holds the head;
# the first team member is kneeling besides the casualty, and holds the opposite shoulder and the opposite hip;
# the second team member is kneeling at the feet, in the axis of the victim, and holds the ankles;
# at the order of the chief, the casualty is rolled towards the first team member, and the fourth team member puts the board or the flexible stretcher in place.
This method can be adapted to place a casualty on a vacuum mattress (see this article).

This method can also be performed by only two first responders: the chief plays the role of the first team member, and the only team member deals with the board (neither the head nor the ankles are gripped). This is rather traumatic for the casualty, but can be used when there is non suspicion of trauma, either in emergency (e.g. to transport a cardiac arrest when advanced life support cannot be performed on site), or when the first responders are lacking.

The method with a flexible stretcher was inspired by the method used to change the sheets of an impotent patient at the hospital. The flexible stretcher is placed beside the casualty, and a sheet is put on it. The third of the stretcher that is the closest to the casualty is folded on the middle third. The casualty is first rolled away from the stretcher, and the stretcher is slid against the back of the casualty. Then the casualty is put on their back and rolled on the other side; the stretcher and the sheet are unfolded. The casualty is wrapped into the sheet, and can be lifted with the handles of the flexible stretcher.

It is also possible to use a roll-and-lift method, or &quot;spoon&quot; lifting ( in French), with three people:
# the first responders are placed on the same side of the casualty; the knee that is closest to the head is lifted, the other one is on the ground;
# the chief is at the head; putting one arm under the neck and reaching the opposite shoulder, the other arm under the back;
# the first team member is besides the pelvis; having one arm under the back, one arm under the back, the other one under the thighs;
# the third team member supports the legs.
At the order of the chief, the casualty is lifted and put on the lifted knees of the first responders. Then, the casualty is flattened against the chests, and the first responders stand up. They move towards the stretcher; there, they put one knee on the ground (the closest to the casualty&#x27;s feet), lay the casualty on his/her back, and move the casualty from their knees to the stretcher. For this last movement, additional first responders can be placed at the opposite side of the stretcher to help the landing.

The spoon lifting can also be used for emergency movements of a casualty when a spine trauma is suspected, e.g. the casualty is unconscious and is threatened by a fast rise of water level (flood).

==Seated person==
Sometimes, it is necessary to lift a seated or half seated person: the seating position is adapted for a conscious person with a chest trauma or of respiratory difficulties.

For this, two team members are placed on each side of the casualty; they place one hand under the buttock, the other under the opposite armpit; the casualty places their arms around the neck of the team members. A third team member lifts the legs as usual, and a fourth pushes the stretcher.

When a heart problem is suspected, the casualty should not lift their arms. In this case, a short strap () can be used: one extremity is slid under the buttock, the other goes under each armpit (and thus crosses the back of the casualty); the extremities are tied to form a ring. The team members use this ring as handles; mind that the head of the casualty is not held.

A long strap () allows the lifting with only three team members:
# a short extremity is slid under the buttocks;
# a team member is placed over the legs of the casualty, facing them; the long extremity goes under the team member&#x27;s armpit and over their opposite shoulder;
# this extremity then goes under the armpits of the casualty, and again under the team member&#x27;s shoulder.
Both extremities are tied or held together by the team member; it makes a cross in the back of the first responder.
The team member can then support the hole weight of the top of the casualty&#x27;s body while keeping a vertical back.

:the long extremity goes on the team member&#x27;s shoulder and under their opposite armpit; then this extremity then goes under the armpits of the casualty, and again on the team member&#x27;s shoulder.
With this possibility, all the weight is on one shoulder; it can be interesting when the first responder has a loose foothold on one side, or has a problem with one shoulder but cannot be replaced by another team member.

When the casualty is seating on a chair and the seated position (with legs down) is possible (i.e. no problem of blood circulation), and if the chair has fixed legs and cannot be folded, then the chair itself can be used for the transport. Otherwise, the chair can be replaced by a wheelchair or a stretcher:
# two team members take place besides the casualty as usual;
# when they lift, a third team member re-removes the chair;
# he/she then puts the wheelchair, or deals with the causality&#x27;s legs as a fourth team member pushes the stretcher.

In some cases, the casualty is found seated but a spine trauma is suspected (e.g. the casualty sat upright after an accident, or fell in this position). In this case, the casualty must be transported lying; a long spine board is put against their back to support it while they are laid down. When the casualty is on a chair, then the board is slid between the back of the casualty and the back of the chair, and the chair is laid down; a Kendrick extrication device (KED) may be used in this context.

<doc id="943966" wikidata="Q694472" url="?curid=943966" title="International Taekwon-Do Federation">
<text>International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF) is an international taekwondo organization founded on March 22, 1966, by Choi Hong Hi () in Seoul, South Korea. The ITF was founded to promote and encourage the growth of the Korean martial art of taekwon-do.

The ITF&#x27;s main functions include coordinating and approving tournaments and seminars, setting standards for teaching (patterns, sparring, destruction), collaborating with affiliated member organizations, and providing services members in regard to rank and certifications.

After Choi&#x27;s death in 2002, there was controversy around the election of his successor that led to multiple organizations claiming the ITF mantle.

== Patterns ==
Patterns, or &quot;tul&quot; (틀) in Korean, originally called &quot;hyeong&quot; (형), form an important aspect of training in taekwon-do. They are equivalent to the &quot;kata&quot; in karate. The majority of the patterns (except Yul-Gok, Ul-Ji and Tong-Il) start with a defensive move, which emphasizes taekwon-do&#x27;s defensive nature. All of the patterns start and end at the same location. This ensures that the practitioners&#x27; stances are the correct length, width, and in the proper direction. Additionally, students are taught to understand the purpose of each movement and recognize how each motion connects to theories of power.

There are 24 patterns in the official ITF syllabus; this is symbolic of the 24 hours in a day. One additional pattern, Ko-Dang (or Go-Dang), was retired/replaced by Juche in 1986 by General Choi Hong Hi. The names of these patterns typically refer either to events in Korean history or to important people in Korean history. Elements of the patterns may also be historical references, such as the number of moves, the diagram, the way the pattern ends, and so on.

Patterns (&quot;tul&quot;) are performed in accordance with &quot;The Encyclopedia of Taekwon-Do&quot; in 15 volumes written by General Choi Hong Hi, the latest edition being from 1999 (later editions have been published, but the 1999 editions were the last General Choi Hong Hi was directly involved with). This comprehensive work contains 15 volumes with volumes 8 to 15 dedicated to the 24 patterns and containing descriptions of the pattern movements as well as pictures showing possible applications of some of the movements. There is also the book entitled &quot;The Korean Art of Self Defense&quot; (the 1999 edition, the latest used by ITF under Chang Ung), also known as the Condensed Encyclopedia, written by General Choi Hong Hi. This is a single condensed encyclopedia of approximately 770 pages with a section dedicated to the 24 original patterns.

There are also three fundamental exercises, named &quot;Saju Jirugi&quot; (Four Direction Punch), &quot;Saju Makgi&quot; (Four Direction Block) and &quot;Saju Tulgi&quot; (Four Direction Thrust). &quot;Saju Jirugi&quot; and &quot;Saju Makgi&quot; are basic defence exercises taught to beginners of the martial art. &quot;Saju Tulgi&quot; is less well known and is generally taught to 2nd Kup students just prior to Hwa-Rang. &quot;Saju Tulgi&quot; is not presented in the Condensed Encyclopedia but is present in the 15 Volume Encyclopedia (see: Volume 10, page 122).

The 24 patterns in taekwon-do ITF are:
The retired patterns in taekwon-do ITF are

#Kodang (고당) (39 movements)
#Woo-Nam (우남) (42 movements)

== Sparring ==
The International Taekwon-Do Federation&#x27;s sparring rules are:
* Hand attacks to the head are allowed.
* The scoring system (by ITF chaired by Prof. Ri Yong Son, based in Vienna) is:
* One (1) point will be awarded for: 
** Hand attack directed to the head or body.
* Two (2) points will be awarded for:
** Foot attack directed to the body. 
* Three (3) points will be awarded for: 
** Kick to the head.
* The competition area is typically a 10×10 meter square in international championships.
Competitors do not wear the &quot;hogu&quot; (although they are required to wear approved foot and hand protection equipment, as well as head guards). This scoring system varies between the different ITF organisations.

A continuous point system is utilized in ITF competition, where the fighters are allowed to continue after scoring a technique. Full-force blows are not allowed, and knockouts result in a disqualification of the attacker; although these rules vary between ITF organizations. At the end of two minutes (or some other specified time) the competitor with more scoring techniques wins.

Fouls in ITF sparring include heavy contact, attacking a fallen opponent, leg sweeping, holding/grabbing, intentional attack to a target other than allowed (for example below the belt, attacks to the back).

ITF competitions also feature performances of patterns, breaking, and &#x27;special techniques&#x27; (where competitors perform prescribed board breaks at great heights).

ITF competition sparring rounds are 2 minutes, and, in national and international levels of competition, they hold two rounds each 2 minutes with a one-minute rest in between. Certain rules are no strikes below the belt, no elbow strikes, brawling, no falling down, no going outside of the ring, hit to the groin and knee strike are not allowed. The ring is a 9 metre by 9 metre (8 × 8 metre optional) ring marked by square mats or tape instead of a traditional style kickboxing rings with ropes. It has no sides allowing the fighter to move out of bounds. Whenever a fighter creates an infraction of the rules the centre referee will issue a warning to the fighter who created the infraction. 3 warnings equals a minus point. If a fighter uses excessive contact, he or she will be given a foul, which is an automatic minus point; three fouls in a bout results in disqualification. ITF taekwon-do is fought in continuous point sparring. Four judges score the fights in each of the corners in the square ring. After the fight, a judge votes for which ever fighter has the most points and a winner is declared. In the case of a draw the fighters go to a one-minute overtime round. If there is another draw the fighters go to a sudden death round where the fighter who scores first is declared the winner.

The official rules for ITF sparring competition are available at the ITF website.

==Ranks==
The ITF ranking system consists of six solid colour belts; white, yellow, green, blue, red, and black.

Coloured belt ranks are called in English &quot;grades&quot; and in Korean &quot;geup&quot; (급) (often romanized as &quot;gup&quot; or &quot;kup&quot;), whereas black belt ranks are called &quot;ranks&quot;/&quot;dan&quot; (단):

The reason for nine black belt degrees is that the number nine is not only the highest of the single-digit numbers, but also is the number of three multiplied by three. In the Orient, three is one of the more esteemed numbers. The Chinese character for 3 is three horizontal lines, one above the other: 三. The bottom line represents earth; the middle line represents mortals; the upper line represents heaven. It was believed that a man who could unite the three realms in himself, would aspire or be reborn into a king; this is shown by the vertical line connecting the realms in the character for king: 王.

===Black belt promotion===
Up to 7th dan, all ranks require the student to perform a test of all skills and knowledge up to their rank to be promoted. 8th and 9th dan may be awarded with consent of the promotion committee with no physical test required, due to the nature and responsibilities of a master no longer being centered on the physical development. However, if the recipient desires, a demonstration may be performed. 9th degree (being the highest) can only be awarded when the special committee examines and reaches a unanimous consent.

According to an ITF Encyclopedia 4th degree may grade students up to 2nd degree. 
A 6th degree International Instructor may grade students up to 3rd degree, while a 7th degree Master may grade students up to 4th degree. An 8th degree Master may grade students up to 6th degree. A 9th degree Grand Master may grade students up to 7th degree. Promotion to 8th degree or above must be done by the ITF&#x27;s Master Promotion Committee.

==History and schism==
After the South Korean Government abandoned the ITF, the government established the World Taekwondo Federation to continue the mission of taekwondo&#x27;s globalization. Once Choi Hong Hi was exiled out of South Korea, he established the new headquarters of the ITF in Vienna, Austria and the organization settled there. In the years that followed, many of the founding masters of the ITF and several other instructors would leave the organization to form their own independent organizations following disagreements with Choi.

Choi subsequently died in June 2002. Disputes over his successor as ITF president lead to splits in the organization. As of 2021 there are two main organizations claiming the ITF mantle. One headed by Ri Yong Son, with offices in Vienna, and another group currently headed by Paul Weiler, headquartered in Lublin, Poland.

<text>Arthemus Ward &quot;Art&quot; Acord (April 17, 1890 – January 4, 1931) was an American silent film actor and rodeo champion. After his film career ended in 1929, Acord worked in rodeo road shows and as a miner in Mexico.

==Early life and career==
Acord was born in Prattville, Utah, to Valentine Louis Acord and Mary Amelia Acord (née Pedersen), Utah pioneers and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Acord&#x27;s father was of German and English descent. The Acord family descends from a Prussian mercenary soldier of the American Revolutionary War whose name was Eckert. Acord&#x27;s paternal grandmother was a descendant of Frances Latham, an early settler of New England who has been called the &quot;Mother of Governors&quot; and the &quot;Mother of Champion Cowboys&quot;. Acord&#x27;s mother, who was of Danish descent, died when Art was just 19 months old while the family was living in the Stillwater, Oklahoma area. The Acord family had moved there for the mother&#x27;s health and took part in the September 28, 1891 Oklahoma Land Run. She died a few weeks later on November 28, 1891. After her death, the family moved back to Utah. As a young man, Acord worked as a cowboy, ranch hand and rodeo contestant. He worked on the ranch of Preston Nutter. In 1912, he won the World Steer Wrestling (Bulldogging) Championship at the Pendleton Round-up and won that same World Championship title again in 1916, defeating challenger and friend Hoot Gibson. 

Acord was one of the few cowboys to have ridden the acclaimed bucking horse Steamboat (who later inspired the bucking horse logo on the Wyoming license plate) for a qualified ride and championship. His rodeo skills had been sharpened when he worked for a time for the Miller Brothers&#x27; traveling 101 Ranch Wild West Show. It was with the 101 that he became friends with Tom Mix, Yakima Canutt, Bee Ho Gray, &quot;Broncho Billy&quot; Anderson and Hoot Gibson. He was sometimes called the &quot;Mormon cowboy&quot; and has been noted as the first real cowboy to become a Hollywood cowboy. He went on to become a noted actor in silent Western films. Acord also performed as a stunt man. He made over 100 film shorts, most of which are now considered lost. 

Acord enlisted in the United States Army in World War I and served overseas. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre for bravery. At war&#x27;s end, he returned to the motion picture business, appearing in a series of popular film shorts and as &quot;Buck Parvin&quot;, the title character for a Universal Pictures serial. Because of a heavy drinking problem and his inability to adapt to the advent of talkies, Acord&#x27;s film career declined and he ended up performing in road shows and mining in Mexico. In March 1928 Acord was seriously burned in an explosion at his home; the loss of his sight was feared.

==Personal life==
Acord was married three times. His first marriage was to actress Edythe Sterling in 1913. They divorced in 1916. In 1920, he married former actress Edna May Nores. Nores filed for divorce in April 1924 citing physical abuse and infidelity. The divorce was finalized the following year. His third marriage was to actress Louise Lorraine on April 14, 1926. The couple divorced in June 1928.

==Death==
On January 4, 1931, Acord died in a Chihuahua, Mexico hospital shortly after taking cyanide in a local hotel room. He was depressed and told the doctor who treated him shortly before he died that he had intentionally taken poison because he wanted to die. His body was sent back to California by train. He was given a military funeral with full honors and was buried in the Vale of Memory section in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Acord has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1709 Vine Street.

<text>Cape Circoncision (Norwegian: Kapp Circoncision) is a peninsula on the north-western edge of subantarctic Bouvet Island. The small peninsula was sighted by the French naval exploration that was led by Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier on 1 January 1739, the Feast of the Circumcision day—thus the name. The cape provided the location for the base-camp of the 1928–1929 Norwegian expedition.

<doc id="943976" wikidata="Q6811778" url="?curid=943976" title="Melbourne Fringe Festival">
<text>The Melbourne Fringe Festival is an annual independent arts festival in Melbourne, Australia, usually over three weeks from late September to early October. Held since 1982, the Festival includes a wide variety of art forms, including theatre, comedy, music, performance art, design, film, cabaret, digital art, and circus. Over 400 shows are held at over 100 venues from bars, clubs and independent theatres to high-profile locations. 

The festival is open-access and artists produce shows independently. Melbourne Fringe also funds and produces its own free events.

==History==
The Fringe Arts Network was formed in 1982, aiming to raise public and government awareness of alternative arts in Melbourne. The Network offered support such as venue advice, shared resources and advocacy.

Fringe Arts Network&#x27;s inaugural event was a mini-festival, followed in 1983 by a week-long event coinciding with Moomba and presenting 120 artists at some 25 locations across Melbourne. 

In 1984, the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds expanded to include Melbourne, and Melbourne&#x27;s Fringe Arts Network became the Melbourne Piccolo Spoleto Fringe Festival. The Melbourne International Festival of the Arts emerged from the Spoleto Festival as a result, and in 1986, the Fringe Arts Network reclaimed its independence from Spoleto and reoriented itself as Melbourne Fringe.

In 2002, the Melbourne Fringe began a Fringe Hub model which programmed a number of closely located venues and offered artists and audiences a central place to gather and network: the Fringe Club at the North Melbourne Town Hall. In 2006, the Melbourne Fringe Club moved upstairs into the North Melbourne Town Hall&#x27;s Main Hall, with a free nightly Fringe Club program. The Fringe Hub also grew to the nearby Lithuanian Club. 

In 2019, the Fringe Hub moved to the renovated Trades Hall in Carlton. Melbourne Fringe also established a year-round program at its Trades Hall venue.

2021 saw the festival go virtual.

==Notable shows==
* Totem (2008) an installation by Sayraphim Lothian, involving 120 dolls, each created by artists from around the world, reflecting their inner identities. 
* Twelve Angry Men (2013) written by Reginald Rose which was staged live in the Supreme Court of Victoria with a cast made up entirely of barristers.
* The Sheds (2013) by James Cunningham, about a gay Australian Football League player.

<doc id="943977" wikidata="Q2910503" url="?curid=943977" title="Boonah, Queensland">
<text>Boonah is a rural town and locality in the Scenic Rim Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Boonah had a population of 2,557 people.

== Geography ==

The town is positioned near the Fassifern Valley, McPherson Range and Main Range. It is surrounded by hills, including Mount French and other Moogerah Peaks. Frog Buttress is a popular rock climbing cliff on the north-west side of Mount French.

The Wyaralong Dam was constructed east of Boonah on Teviot Brook, a tributary of the Logan River. At full supply level, water would have inundated parts of the road connecting Boonah and Beaudesert, so a new section of road has been built. Water for the town is supplied from Lake Moogerah on Reynold&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of the Bremer River. Maroon Dam is another reservoir built south of Boonah at the base of the McPherson Range.

State Route 93, a road with two names, runs through the locality, entering from the north as Ipswich – Boonah Road (Coronation Drive in the town) and exiting to the south as Boonah – Rathdowney Road (Yeates Avenue). Boonah–Fassifern Road (State Route 90) exits to the west from its junction with the other roads.

== History ==

Ugarapul the Aboriginal language of South-East Queensland.the name and dialect of a clan that is used within the local government boundaries of City of Ipswich, Lockyer Valley Region and Somerset Region.

The history of Boonah township is connected to the nearby settlement of Dugandan which was named after the Dugandan pastoral run that was taken up in August 1844 by Macquarie McDonald and his brother Campbell Livingstone McDonald. Dugandan was one of the earliest pastoral holdings in Queensland. In its early years the area was stocked with sheep but the region was discovered to be well suited for cattle and over time became renowned for the quality of its beef and dairy herds. Adjacent to the property of Dugandan was Coochin Coochin station. In January 1861, a massacre of Ugarapul people, estimated to be as many as 40, is recorded in the area of Hardie&#x27;s Station, Dugandan Scrub. In 1873, part of the Coochin Coochin pastoral run was acquired by Frederick Macarthur Bowman who named his property Denelgin. Frederick Bowman took advantage of the suitability of the area for cattle and is considered one of the dairying pioneers of the region.

Variously known as Dugandan Scrub and Blumbergville, Boonah was also positioned within the boundaries of the early Dugandan property. Following the introduction of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 and the subdivision of the large pastoral runs, the settlement fell within the boundaries of a new 320 acre property acquired by John Hooper in 1878.

Due to the scattered distribution of European settlers, the close proximity of the two settlements that would eventually become the townships of Dugandan and Boonah and the lack of a clear geographical centre, during the 1870s - 1880s the names Dugandan, Blumbergville and Boonah were used interchangeably. As late as 1888, the courts of petty sessions were described as occurring at &quot;Boonah, otherwise known as Blumbergville&quot;.

The Dugandan Provisional School opened on 15 July 1878 between Dugandan Scrub and Dugandan Flats next to the Teviot Brook on land which would eventually fall within the boundaries of the Blumbergville/Boonah township. The school was the first building in the township. On 30 May 1887 it became Dugandan State School. In 1895 it was renamed Boonah State School. (A separate Dugandan State School operated between 1917 and 1966 in Dugandan).By 1880, 40 families were living in the Dugandan Scrub area and Blumbergville was starting to be established. Blumbergville took its name from a store owned by three brothers, Max, Levi and Adolf Blumberg, located on the later site of the Commercial Hotel in High Street, Boonah.

The Fassifern railway line (Queensland&#x27;s first branch railway line) opened from Ipswich to Harrisville on 10 July 1882. On 12 September 1887 the line was extended to Dugundan with Boonah being served by Boonah railway station in Yeates Street (). The line closed in June 1964. There is a memorial to the railway line in Yeates Street at the back of the Commercial Hotel (). The town takes its name from the railway station and is an Aboriginal word referring ether to the Bloodwood tree (&quot;Eucalyptus Corymbosa&quot;) or the Brigalow tree (&quot;Acacia harpadhylla&quot;).

In 1882, the Primitive Methodist Church congregation had grown too large to continue to use the Provisional School. Thomas Hardcastle donated of land for a church on Old Mount Alford Road near the former Dugandan Bridge. There was a ceremonial cutting of the first sod on Saturday 23 December 1882 by Miss Jessie Hardcastle. The church was and built by George Beverley and T. Austin. It was officially opened on 4 November 1883. In 1892 concerns about flooding led to fundraising to relocate the church to the southern end of High Street in Boonah (now the location of the manse). Eventually that church building became too small for the congregation so a new church was built at 9 Church Street () and was officially opened on Sunday 10 November 1907. In 1908 the old church building was relocated to Kalbar. Following the amalgamation of the Methodist Church into the Uniting Church in Australia, a new Uniting Church building was built at 10 Macquarie Street (). The church building in Church Street was sold to the Salvation Army and was subsequently sold into private ownership.

Around 1884, the Blumbergville Post Office was opened.

In 1887, the railway line from Ipswich was extended to the area, with the name Boonah given to a rail siding at Blumbergville located one stop before the terminus at the settlement of nearby Dugandan. The railway siding took its name from an Aboriginal word from the Yuggera and Yugumbir language groups meaning bloodwood tree (Corymbia gummifera) or Brigalow tree (Acacia harpophylla).

The local government, the Goolman Division, had its office in Flinders, but the coming of the railway to Boonah resulted in the relocation of the Goolman Division to Boonah in 1888.

Following devastating floods in 1887, the main commercial interests for the district relocated from the lower lying Dugandan, near the railway terminus, to the higher ground of Boonah.

The Post Office was renamed Boonah around 1888.

Christ Church, a Church of England, was officially opened on 26 May 1890 by Archbishop William Webber assisted by Rev James Coles, rector at Harrisville. The church was designed by John H. Buckeridge. (the diocesan architect for the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane) and built by Mr Vincent of Boonah. Prior to the opening of the church, Church of England services were held in the Goolman Divisional Board office. At the time of the opening of the church, there was no permanent minister. On 7 July 1956 Archbishop Reginald Halse set a stone in the second church building being erected dedicating the new church as a memorial to the martyrs of the New Guinea Mission and those who died in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. The second church as dedicated in 1960 and consecrated in 1961. The original church continues to be used as a church hall.

By the end of 1900, the Fassifern Butter Factory owned by Mr. S. Dover was operating in Church Street. On 5 July 1916 a larger state-of-the-art factory with a separate office building, known as the Boonah Butter Factory was officially opened on a new site on the northern entry to the town by the Queensland Governor Hamilton Goold-Adams. The Boonah Butter Factory closed on 1 March 1974 due to declining production as a result of low prices for milk and shifting agricultural practices in the region.

Miss Esme Clarke&#x27;s Private School opened on 1905 in a room was rented from All Saints Church. It closed on 1910.

In April 1905, John Carl Streiner opened his Commercial Hotel on the north-west corner of High Street and Park Street. It was a two-storey building with filigree lace balustrading on the upper verandah. Streiner had formerly operated the Royal Exchange Hotel (previously known as the Dugandan Hotel, not to be confused with the current hotel of that name in Dugandan). Carl Behncken leased and operated the new hotel.
The Goolman Shire War Memorial was unveiled in Boonah (then part of the Goolman Shire) on 19 May 1920 by General Birdwood and Councillor Alexander John Tait McKay. It is generally known as the Boonah War Memorial.

Initially only a primary school, Boonah State School had a secondary class added in February 1955, which it retained until 25 January 1965 when Boonah State High School opened.

All Saints&#x27; Catholic Primary School was constructed in 1956 using volunteer labour. It was officially opened on 4 November 1956 by Archbishop James Duhig. It was operated by the Sisters of Mercy until 1989 when it passed to the lay leadership of principal Kathleen Lambourne.

Boonah was the centre of the Shire of Boonah local government area until council amalgamations occurred in 2008.

<doc id="943988" wikidata="Q822167" url="?curid=943988" title="Kama Sutra Records">
<text>Kama Sutra Records was started in 1964 by Artie Ripp, Hy Mizrahi, and Phil Steinberg as Kama Sutra Productions, a production house. The &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; is an ancient Sanskrit text.

In 1965, the company was joined by Art Kass and the record label itself was started. A distribution deal with MGM Records was later signed, which lasted from 1965 until 1969. From 1969 onward, distribution was then handled by co-owned Buddah Records.

The record company ceased in mid-1976 but restarted in 1981 as Sutra Records. Under this moniker, Kass marketed and distributed Fever Records, Blue Dog Records, Baila Records, Becket Records, and signed and recorded the Cover Girls, Gene Vincent, the Fat Boys, Victor Willis, and many more before the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993. The 1965–1976 Kama Sutra catalogue is now owned by Sony Music Entertainment and managed by Legacy Recordings. The 1981–1993 Sutra catalogue, with the exception of the Fat Boys, is controlled by Unidisc Music.

*Frank Gill, the National MP for East Coast Bays, resigned from parliament in 1980 in order to take up a position as New Zealand&#x27;s ambassador in Washington. The ensuing by-election was won, much to the National Party&#x27;s surprise, by Gary Knapp of the Social Credit Party.

<text>Motorkhana is a low-cost form of motorsport, unique to Australia and New Zealand but similar to autotesting in the UK and Ireland and gymkhana in the US. It involves manoeuvring a car through tight tests as quickly as possible - one car at a time - on either dirt or bitumen surfaces. This usually requires sliding and spinning the car accurately while maintaining speed through the test course. Some reversing is usually included. 

Each test takes from 15 to 60 seconds to complete and is defined by flags. Hitting flags or going the wrong way incur time penalties which are added to the total time. A day’s competition – an event – usually includes 8 to 12 tests. Vehicle speed rarely exceeds 60 km/h (37 mph) but the tightness of the tests ensures the driver is kept very busy.

Most competitors use normal road cars but some use specially built vehicles (motorkhana specials) which are much lighter and have specialised braking systems to facilitate the spin turns. Some motorkhana specials use modified automatic transmissions to facilitate rapid gearchanges between first and reverse gears. They usually use racing slick tyres for bitumen and concrete surfaces.

Awards are made to the driver with the lowest total time in each class. Classes separate production cars from specials and large production cars from small production cars. There are often classes for female drivers, and for junior drivers as young as 12.

Most Australian motorkhanas are run to the National Motorkhana Code rules. Australian championship and state championship events use tests from the Motorkhana Test booklet which specifies test dimensions, required direction of travel and flag colours. Most championship motorkhanas are run on bitumen or concrete while club events are usually on dirt, grass or mud.

<text>The Fall River is a river in Frontenac and Lanark Counties in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is part of the Ottawa River drainage basin, and flows from Sharbot Lake and through Bennett Lake to join the Mississippi River. The river is named after settlers of the late 17th century.

==Course==
The Fall River is fed from Sharbot Lake in Central Frontenac, Frontenac County and numerous springs, and it meanders along the Trans Canada Trail. It passes into Tay Valley, Lanark County and flows through the community of Maberly; fills the 20 km of Bennett Lake; flows by the community of Fallbrook; and about from its origin, reaches its mouth at the Mississippi River.

==Ecology==
The river is bordered by forest and is home to fish, turtles, Blue Herons, beaver and otters

<doc id="944016" wikidata="Q1392753" url="?curid=944016" title="Fartlek">
<text>Fartlek is a middle and long-distance runner&#x27;s training approach developed in the late 1930s by Swedish Olympian Gösta Holmér. It has been described as a relatively unscientific blending of &quot;continuous training&quot; (e.g., long slow distance training), with its steady pace of moderate-high intensity aerobic intensity, and &quot;interval training&quot;, with its “spacing of more intense exercise and rest intervals.” Simply stated, in its widely adapted contemporary forms, Fartlek training is alternating periods of faster and slower running, often over natural terrain, including both “level and hilly terrain.”

While Fartlek training is generally associated with running, it can be incorporated into almost any kind of exercise. The variable intensities and the continuous nature of the exercise stresses both the aerobic and anaerobic parts of the runner&#x27;s physiology. It differs from traditional interval training by being less structured.

An example of its more modern manifestations in the training of serious runners is found in &quot;Mona Fartlek&quot;, named for Australian distance runner Steve Moneghetti, devised by Olympian Chris Wardlaw. This training style injects speed into a 20 minute session, pairing alternating periods of effort and recovery: 90 seconds on, 90 seconds off (performed twice), then 60 seconds on-then-off, and 30 seconds on-then-off, and 15 seconds on-then-off (each of these performed four times), generally, with intensity (pace) increasing as the effort period shortens, with the specifics determined by coach and athlete.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;Fartlek&quot; comes from Swedish, Fart the word for speed, and Lek means play, and so “speed-play” It was originally written in upper case, although it now generally appears in lower case. It is otherwise known as the Swedish natural method or simply the Swedish method.

==Modern definition and utility==
Fartlek has been described as a “relatively unscientific blending” of 
&quot;continuous training&quot;—whose forms include long slow distance training—with its steady pace of moderate-high intensity aerobic intensity (where by this is implied a level of activity at 60–80% VO2max) and &quot;interval training&quot;, with its &quot;spacing of [more intense] exercise and rest intervals.&quot; Hence, in its widely adapted contemporary forms, Fartlek training can simply be described as alternating periods of faster and slower exercise (i.e., running), intermixed. In this adaptation of these other well-characterized training methods, the interplay between the effort (exercise) and recovery (relief) are not systematically manipulated; instead, the athlete and coach determine the interplay &quot;based on &#x27;how it feels&#x27;&quot; during the training. To some extent, in distinction to the earliest forms of Fartlek, its evolution has taken it further in directions away from the track, toward natural outdoor terrain, including both “level and hilly terrain.”

From the perspective of exercise physiology,[w]hen properly applied, [a Fartlek training approach] overloads one or all of the energy systems... [and so] provides ideal general conditioning and off-season training strategies ... [adding] freedom and variety to workouts.In relation to continuous and interval training methods, these same authors note that there is “[i]nsufficient evidence ... proclaiming superiority of any specific training method to improve aerobic capacity and associated physiologic variables ... Each form of training produces success.” They go on to argue that, “[o]ne can probably use the various training methods interchangeably, particularly to modify training and achieve a more psychologically pleasing exercise or training regimen.”

== History ==
=== Gösta Holmér ===

Swedish coach Gösta Holmér developed Fartlek in the 1930s; since then, many runners and running coaches have adopted it. It was designed for the Swedish cross country running teams, which had been beaten throughout the 1920s by Paavo Nurmi and long time rivals the Finnish team. Holmér&#x27;s new training plan applied a faster-than-race training pace and innovated by mixing speed work and stamina training into one session. Like interval training, it involves running at speeds far higher than normal for short periods. Where Fartlek differs from interval sessions is in the fact that these short bursts of pace occur within a continuous long run. The short, fast runs alternate with longer periods of easier running.

=== Early uses of Fartlek ===
In the late 1930s, the decade following Finnish runners&#x27; supremacy under Paavo Nurmi, Gosta Holmer was the national coach for Sweden (see Gösta Holmér article), and he devised an approach that has been called as &quot;innovative as any idea in athletics&#x27; history&quot;, introducing &quot;faster-than-race-pace, simultaneous speed/endurance training&quot; which he termed &quot;Fartlek&quot; (with a capital &quot;f&quot;), meaning &quot;speed play&quot;. In Holmér&#x27;s hands, the sustainable speed of his runners was not achieved through Fartlek workouts alone; his training regimen included &quot;[r]epeat track workouts, tempo runs and time trials ... alternated or combined with Fartlek&quot; through each training week. For his Swedish runners, which were world-class, the original Fartlek workout has been described as &quot;a total of 12 kilometres running[,] with up to 5,000 metres ... being at faster than race pace.&quot; Described by another, a typical workout might be &quot;seven total miles of running with 4,000 or 5,000 meters worth of lickety-splits [faster-paced intervals], from 40-meter sprints to upwards of 2,400-meter pick-ups&quot;.

Holmer used the technique on a 2 mile forest loop where he instructed Gunder Haegg and Arne Anderson to run fast when the instinct moved them and slower to recover. He credited Fartlek as the reason they ran near 4:01 for the mile on various occasions.

Fartlek training was, by one account, introduced in the United States, in the 1940s. By the 1960s, in the hands of Doris Brown Heritage, an inductee of the Track and Field Hall of Fame and running coach at Seattle Pacific University, her Fartlek workouts had become assigned to 20-minute sessions beginning and ending with mile runs, between which were sandwiched an unstructured intermix of &quot;40 to 200-yard sprints and five to seven minute segment &#x27;perceived exertions&#x27;&quot;. In her university coaching, her cross country and track runners faced these, as well as &quot;lots of short sprints ... [and] five to seven minute runs&quot;.

At Portsea on the Australian shore, at a &quot;rough and tumble training resort&quot;, Percy Cerutty had, through the 1950s and into the 1960s, applied forms of Fartlek focusing on the freedom of training variations it allowed; his forms were &quot;deeper and steeper&quot;, involving &quot;20 percent beach running in heavy sand, 10 percent repetitions [running] up dunes ... and the remainder ... sprints, jogs and middle-distance runs&quot; akin to those introduced by Holmér, which he led &quot;along cliff top paths ... [and] seashore and dirt roads.&quot; The work on the dunes was noteworthy in that some were &quot;as high as 80 feet and as steeply graded as the stairs up the Statue of Liberty&quot;. (Quoting sprint champion Joe Schatzle, Sr., Runner&#x27;s World notes that &quot;Cerruty ... took training to places no one ever thought of before—and few have thought about since.&quot;) For Australian runners training at Portsea, which for some comprised half of their yearly schedules, the training was without any traditional, structured track work. In the early 1960s, innovative and highly regarded distance coaches such as New Zealander Arthur Lydiard adapted Holmér&#x27;s training approach, and like Cerutty, introduced Fartlek-type workouts (alongside his long slow distance methods), again &quot;over both flat and varied trails&quot;, using markers to indicate points at which sprint and middle-distance changes in pace were to be made. As described by Joe Rogers, who coached at Ball State University and West Point, &quot;[t]he Swedes used ... pine needle forest trails ... terrain training, and hilly Fartlek courses ... [but] primarily, it was on level paths&quot;, whereas Lydiard used both flat and graded elements in his training: &quot;On the flats, athletes changed paces at markers. The hill courses had built-in stressors.&quot;

====Example session====

This is the first session that was designed by Gösta Holmér for a cross-country (multi-terrain) runner. It is an example of what a Fartlek session might look like—although Fartlek sessions should be designed for an athlete&#x27;s own event or sport, as well as catering to their individual needs.

According to this source, sessions should be at an intensity that causes the athlete to work at 60% to 80% of his or her maximum heart rate. This should mean that the body will not experience too much discomfort while exercising. An athlete should also include a good warm up at the beginning of the session, and a cool down at the end of the session, to improve performance, minimize post-workout muscle soreness, and decrease the chances of injury and for other reasons. An example of a training session is:
*Warm up: easy running for 5 to 10 minutes.
*1 minute on, 2 minutes off, alternating fast and easy pace (3–4 times)
*Cool down: 10 minutes at an easy pace

== Fartlek variations ==
===Major forms===
==== Mona Fartlek ====
Australian distance runner Steve Moneghetti lends his nickname to a training workout &quot;well known ... in Australia&quot;, which was &quot;devised by his ... coach Chris Wardlaw ... a dual Olympian&quot;. The workout, which provides a &quot;way to inject ... speed&quot; into a run, has been described as a &quot;cut-down ladder-Fartlek&quot;, and was a track workout in its original design but is suited to any continuous course. The workout was designed to fit a 20-minute session, accompanied by a requisite warmup and cooldown, e.g., of half the training length (i.e., ca. 10-minutes each). It pairs periods of effort and recovery, specifically consisting of two 90-second efforts (each followed by the same length of recovery), with the same pattern then being followed for four efforts of 60 seconds, four efforts of 30 seconds, and four efforts of 15 seconds. A stated assumption of the workout is that as the period of effort shortens, the intensity (pace) of the effort increases, although actual workouts are tailored to individual runners&#x27; needs (i.e., there is &quot;no hard and fast rule&quot;). In one description of the workout, beginning pace during the effort portions is intended to fall about at the runners &quot;5K pace&quot;, with subsequent shorter intervals being taken at faster pace as the runner is able, and with recoveries varying from walking and easy jogging for newer and other runners needing &quot;more recovery between hard efforts&quot;, to half-marathon/marathon &quot;race pace recovery&quot; or 5K/10K race pace &quot;moderate recovery&quot; for more experienced runners. In more sophisticated presentations, the workout is adapted to particular periods of a runner&#x27;s &quot;training year&quot;:[F]or example ... in a base building period ... the efforts remain completely aerobic, but very near the top of the anaerobic threshold. The recoveries are floats, rather than easy jogging. During this [period], the run more resembles a tempo run with a higher level of intensity than what a tempo effort in one [continuous] strong effort can typically offer. During the quality [periods] of training, the recoveries can be a jog, while the efforts delve into the anaerobic realm. The efforts should be done by feel and can range in ... pace from 1500m ... to 10k race pace, again depending on the time of year.

===Other forms===

;Three speeds version
In order to add more variety and complexity, runners can add another speed into the run. Within any run, &quot;there is no reason why three different paces should not be included.&quot; This would change a normal Fartlek by doing a jog, run, and a full-out sprint.

;Mailbox version
Runners hypothetically &quot;run hard for two mailboxes, recover for three, run hard for three, recover for two.&quot; When executing this type, the runner continues like this for the allotted time or distance determined.

;Dog park version
Runners speed up when they get close to a dog in order to pass them; after passing the dog, they would then slow down for the recovery period.

;Music version
Many runners use music while they run. Runners can use their music as a template for their Fartlek run by changing their speed according to different parts of a song. For example, they can speed up during the chorus and slow down for the rest of the song.

;Popular beginner&#x27;s description
Fartlek can simply include periods of jogging combined with short periods of sprinting, or, for beginners, walking combined with jogging; e.g., a person may be asked to &quot;sprint all out from one light pole to the next, jog to the corner, give a medium effort for a couple of blocks, jog between four light poles and sprint to a stop sign, and so on&quot;, until the desired distance or running time is reached.&quot; 
== Benefits ==
=== Easily adjustable ===
Since the workout is easily manipulated, &quot;Fartlek training allows you to add an endless variety of intervals to your aerobic workouts, which helps to keep you stimulated.&quot; Variety can be achieved by changing the amount of distance, time, fast bursts, recovery periods, and even the time at which one does each component.

=== Race day readiness ===
For competitive runners, Fartleks and other types of interval runs are key for race day readiness. The alternating speeds that are the defining point of Fartleks allow runners to work &quot;both the aerobic and anaerobic training systems while simulating the ebb and flow nature of competitive running.&quot;

=== Body strengthening ===
Fartleks keep runners&#x27; bodies in top shape so that they can keep racing. Putting Fartlek runs in a workout routine keeps &quot;muscles, tendons, nerves, etc. used in running going at top capacity,&quot; keeping their bodies strong enough to maintain the mechanics of racing.

=== Fat burn ===
By alternating the &quot;intensity of your workouts, you will burn more calories than you would by keeping a steady pace.&quot; While running, the runner&#x27;s body uses a combination of carbohydrates and fat, with relatively more carbohydrates metabolized at faster speeds and relatively more fat the longer the workout lasts. A Fartlek workout allows the body to adapt to using both sources of energy, with the desired adaptation towards fat metabolism occurring during slower periods. In addition, varying speeds improves cardiovascular endurance slightly more than running at a steady pace for the same time and total distance.

=== Sports training variability ===
Fartleks can be specially tailored to fit the needs of different types of athletes. An example is basketball, where &quot;you must exert maximum effort while running a fast break, while you exert very little effort while standing at the foul line.&quot; It is possible to alter the type and timing of the Fartlek in order to mimic the intensity of an average basketball game. This can be done for other sports such as tennis, rugby, soccer, and football as well.

== Compared to other routines ==

Other routines include traditional interval training, and ladder and tempo runs. These workouts have some similarities to Fartlek routines, but are distinguished from them and one from another by slight differences.

=== Interval runs ===
Intervals &quot;are short, intense efforts followed by equal or slightly longer recovery time.&quot; By the end of a short burst of speed, the runner is barely able to keep up that pace. Unlike Fartleks, interval runs are much more structured; usually running the fast and slow spurts at exact times or distances. Interval runs and tempo runs differ in the fact that tempo runs maintain a faster pace for a set amount of time, while interval runs consist of alternating between sprints and slow sections instead of maintaining one speed.

=== Ladders ===
Ladders are defined as &quot;a speed workout in which the fast parts vary in length.&quot; Athletes run a short time or distance at a hard pace, then work that time/distance up and back down with timed breaks in between. The structure of ladder workouts is similar to interval training, but the two differ in that the work periods vary in time or distance in ladder training. The fact that the portions performed at the faster speed vary in length or time mirrors Fartlek runs.

=== Tempo runs ===
Tempo runs are typically run for 20 to 25 minutes at a 6 or 7 RPE (out of 10). This exercise is &quot;like an Oreo cookie, with the warmup and cooldown as the cookie, and a run at an effort at or slightly above your anaerobic threshold (the place where your body shifts to using more glycogen for energy) as the filling.&quot; Runners warm up at a slow and steady pace, run harder than they would on a normal distance jog for an allotted amount of time, and then do a cool down with a very similar speed to the warm-up.

<doc id="944017" wikidata="Q1901416" url="?curid=944017" title="World's Strongest Man">
<text>The World&#x27;s Strongest Man is an international strongman competition held every year. Organized by American event management company IMG, a subsidiary of Endeavor, it is broadcast in the US during summers and in the UK around the end of December each year. Competitors qualify based on placing in the top three at the four to eight Giants Live events each year. The current event sponsor is SBD Apparel. Previous sponsors include Tachi Palace, Coregenx, Commerce Hotel and Casino, DAF Trucks, Tonka, MET-Rx, and PartyPoker.com.

The competition has been won by 24 men representing 13 nationalities. Three of the champions, Bill Kazmaier, Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson and Brian Shaw, have been inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. The competition also has several rival and parallel competitions with which it is sometimes confused, including the Arnold Strongman Classic, Rogue Invitational and Strongest Man on Earth.

== History ==
There are now several documentaries available that chart the history of WSM. The first major one is Worlds Strongest Man - Thirty Years Of Pain from 2008, celebrating the 30th anniversary. In 2017, a series of videos were released in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the contest.

===1970s–1980s===
The concept behind &quot;The World&#x27;s Strongest Men&quot;, as it was originally named, was developed in 1977 for CBS by Langstar Inc. David Webster, a Scot who later received an OBE for his services to sport, was the head coordinator of the competition from its inception. Douglas Edmunds, seven-time Scottish shot and discus champion and twice world caber champion, worked with Webster and when Webster retired, Edmunds took over. These two men were responsible for inviting the competitors and choosing the events. In the meantime, in 1982, CBS sold the rights to the BBC, who in turn sold the rights to TWI. In 1987, the WSM was not held for the only time since its inception. In that year, the first and only non-team Pure Strength competition was held, but it was not part of the WSM franchise.

For the first several contests, American color commentators and analysts were used on the network broadcast. These included Brent Musburger, Tom Brookshier, and acknowledged strength authority, journalist and author Terry Todd. Todd was a former powerlifting world record holder himself and went on to establish the H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports in 1990. He also was asked to establish the Arnold Strongman Classic in 2002 by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

During this early period, the contest ranks consisted mostly of American football players, powerlifters, and bodybuilders and were held in American locations until it was moved to Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1983. Two-time winner Bruce Wilhelm (USA) retired and was succeeded by Don Reinhoudt in 1979, a 162 kg (357 lb) heavyweight powerlifter of the US. Reinhoudt still holds several unequipped world records in powerlifting.

In 1979, newcomer and legendary powerlifter Bill Kazmaier (USA) made his appearance, coming in 3rd after leading much of the competition. He dominated the sport to such an extent from 1980 to 1982, winning by a record 28 points in 1980. He reportedly was excluded from the competition for five years, after becoming the first man to win three consecutive WSM titles. He set prodigious marks with a 478.5 kg (1055 lb) silver dollar coin deadlift, 439.5 kg (969 lb) squat (smith machine), and a then-record 165.6 kg (365 lb) log lift with a rough, unbalanced log. This eventually earned him a place in the WSM Hall of Fame.

After Kazmaier left, his nearest rival, former Olympian Geoff Capes from the UK, traded wins with the Icelandic powerlifter Jón Páll Sigmarsson, with Capes winning in 1983 and 1985, and Sigmarsson in 1984 and 1986. Sigmarsson raised the popularity and awareness of the event to new levels. He died three years after winning his 4th and final WSM in 1990. In 1987, Sigmarsson would defeat Capes and Kazmaier in Pure Strength. Kazmaier returned to WSM in 1988, but could not dethrone Sigmarsson, who won his 3rd title. The only other man to claim the title in this era was Jamie Reeves, which he did in 1989. Reeves was injured in 1990, as Sigmarsson narrowly claimed his 4th title ahead of O.D. Wilson, who was leading by 5.5 points going into the final event, a controversial 200m race with 100 kg on the back. Sigmarsson won the event, and the much larger Wilson finished way down the field, meaning Jon Pall became the first man to claim four titles.

===1990s===
In 1995, Edmunds and Webster, along with representatives from the competitors including Jamie Reeves, Ilkka Kinnunen and Marcel Mostert formed a governing body called the International Federation of Strength Athletes (&quot;IFSA&quot;). The IFSA began organizing bespoke events, such as the IFSA European Championships and also took the lead in working with the BBC and with TWI to organize the World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition. For almost a decade, the IFSA and WSM were inextricably mixed, but this changed in 2004. The InvestGroup Ventures&#x27; sports rights management arm, InvestGroup Sports Management, invested heavily into IFSA and this led to the creation of IFSA Strongman. The strategy was to acquire most of the international assets and properties relating to the strongman sport. In essence, this was a new organisation with some, such as Magnus Samuelsson, describing it as &quot;a new company ... with the same name as our old federation&quot;. The attempt at dominance was not well received by TWI and disagreement ensued leading to a split in the sport. Previously, in 2001, the IFSA in its former guise had entered an agreement with World Class Events (WCE), headed by Ulf Bengtsson, to run the Super Series. This Super Series was designed to award the World Championship title, but also acted as a qualifying vehicle for the WSM. When strongman split in 2004, the Super Series sided with TWI forming a rival federation to the IFSA. With the WSM being a TWI owned event, IFSA Holdings announced its own World Championships for 2005, to be held in Quebec, and thus from that point had no involvement in the WSM contest.

The split with IFSA, which banned its registered athletes from competing at WSM, meant that not all the recognized best strength athletes in the world were eligible to compete. However, the reputation of WSM as the premier event maintained its lure for broadcasting purposes. In recent years, the competition has been broadcast on ESPN, ESPN2, TSN, Televisa Deportes and Five, and currently CBS Sports Network in the US. The longevity of the contest in strength athletics and its high levels of TV exposure over the years has led to it being described as &quot;the granddaddy of all strongman contests&quot;.

In recent years, to curb injuries, the contest events have included a certain amount of athleticism rather than being about raw strength. This has led some critics to say that contests such as the Arnold Strongman Classic or Fortissimus are the true strongest man competitions. However, it is routinely described as &quot;the Worlds&quot; by top strongman competitors and despite the critics, it is the leading brand name in the field. No other strongman contest commands close to the WSM&#x27;s levels of TV exposure. The World&#x27;s Strongest Man claims a viewership of 220 million.

In the early 1990s, Magnús Ver Magnússon (Iceland) won the title four times (1991, 1994–1996) and became the second and only man along with the legendary Bill Kazmaier to win three consecutive titles. He came into the 1991 contest as the reserve and ended up winning the show, and is the only man to do so.

Magnús would also finish 2nd in both 1992 and 1993. The 1992 contest was won by Dutchman Ted van der Parre, who at 7 feet tall, is the tallest man ever to win or compete at the World&#x27;s Strongest Man. In one of the closest contests in the competition&#x27;s history, just 1 point separated Ted in 1st from Magnús and Jamie Reeves, who tied for 2nd. Conversely, in 1993, Welshman Gary Taylor became the shortest man to ever win the contest at just 6 feet tall, defeating Magnús and Riku Kiri of Finland.

Magnús would finally get his second title in 1994, defeating Austrian Manfred Hoeberl in the closely fought contest, with Kiri finishing 3rd for the second year running. He retained his title the following year, with South African Gerrit Badenhorst and Finland&#x27;s Marko Varalahti completing the podium. In 1996, Magnús made it to three titles in a row, with his closest competitor Kiri pulling out of the final event due to injury, but still finishing in second. Badenhorst made the podium for the second year in a row. Remarkably, none of these three men would make the final the following year.

The late 1990s saw Scandinavian countries taking control of the title, and this lasted until 2002. The relatively small 125 kg (275 lb) but dynamic Jouko Ahola from Finland won two titles in three years during this period, 1997 and 1999. He later became a referee in WSM/strongman events and an actor. Sweden&#x27;s Magnus Samuelsson would claim the 1998 title, becoming the only man to defeat Ahola in a WSM contest. 

===2000s===

Following Ahola&#x27;s retirement, fellow Finn Janne Virtanen would improve on his 1999 runner up finish and take the title for himself in 2000. The final Scandinavian in this group to take the title was Norwegian Svend Karlsen, who did so in 2001.

The early to late 2000s were dominated by five-time Polish winner Mariusz Pudzianowski, earning him the nickname &quot;The Dominator&quot;. Looking muscular and defined, he temporarily redefined what a strongman was in the world&#x27;s eyes. At about 142 kg (313 lb) at max weight, he routinely beat men much bigger than he was. He combined speed and substantial strength in one package. Indeed, he was so dominant that three of his five championships (2003, 2005 and 2007) were won with an event to spare. His final win was in 2008 as bigger and taller men came into the sport.

Pudzianowski&#x27;s first title was in 2002, as the era of Scandinavian dominance came to an end, with Lithuanian Žydrūnas Savickas and Latvian Raimonds Bergmanis completing the podium. He would defend his title in 2003 in spectacular fashion. He won four of the seven events, and claiming two second places and a third place in the remaining events to finish with 66 out of a possible 70 points, and 20 ahead of runner up Savickas. 2003 was also the first appearance of Ukrainian Vasyl Virastyuk, who finished 3rd.

In 2004, Savickas and Virastyuk were tied for the lead heading into the final event, the Atlas Stones. Virastyuk would defeat Savickas to claim the title, with the Lithuanian finishing as runner-up for the 3rd year in a row. Originally, Mariusz Pudzianowski finished in 3rd but was later disqualified after failing a drugs test, meaning Magnus Samuelsson would once again finish on the podium.

Following the split of IFSA and WSM, most of the athletes would stick with IFSA. Pudzianowski was, in fact, the only athlete from the 2004 contest to compete at WSM in 2005. He would win the contest with an event to spare ahead of runner up Jesse Marunde, who with 3rd place Dominic Filiou became the first non-Europeans to reach the podium of WSM since O.D. Wilson in 1990.

The 2006 competition ended in dramatic fashion: in the final, Mariusz Pudzianowski started well by coming tied-1st in the Deadlift and winning the Power Stairs easily; but by then winning the last 5 events in a row, Phil Pfister edged out the Pole in the final event, the Atlas stones. Pfister became the first American to win the competition since 1982, and the first American ever to win the competition outside the United States.

Pudzianowski regained his crown in 2007, winning the contest with an event to spare. Fellow Pole Sebastian Wenta claimed 2nd place, with Britain&#x27;s Terry Hollands rounding out the podium.

In 2008, Derek Poundstone had a large lead over Mariusz Pudzianowski after three events but Pudzianowski tied the Deadlift event for first place and then won the crucial Plane Pull to narrow the gap. Pudzianowski and Poundstone then battled for the title of World&#x27;s Strongest Man in the last event, the Atlas Stones. Pudzianowski blistered through the event and was able to keep pace with the heavier Poundstone. On the final stone, Pudzianowski was able to capitalize on Poundstone&#x27;s drop and clinched his fifth title.

In 2009, the long-running IFSA/WSM split had ended, resulting in finally having all of the top strongmen from around the world compete in the same contest. Two-time IFSA World Champion Žydrūnas Savickas would return to the contest after 5 years and claim his first WSM title, with defending champion Mariusz Pudzianowski coming in second in his final ever WSM contest. Another up and comer Brian Shaw placed third.

===2010s===
Žydrūnas Savickas repeated his victory in 2010, winning by countback against Brian Shaw in the closest finish in WSM history. Top IFSA competitor and fan favorite Mikhail Koklyaev finished third in his WSM debut. Savickas set a new world record in the Giant Wooden Log Lift with a lift of .

In 2011, Brian Shaw and two-time defending champion Žydrūnas Savickas were tied on points going into the final event. Shaw defeated Savickas in the Atlas Stones, winning his first title. Over the next four years, the pair would trade the title back and forth.
Going into the 2012 contest, Shaw suffered from nerve damage in his hands and slipped down to fourth place. This opened the door for Savickas to capture his third WSM title, with fellow Lithuanian Vytautas Lalas coming in second and the Icelandic giant Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson finishing third. Savickas set a new world record in the Log Lift with a lift of .
Shaw would regain his title in 2013, ahead of Savickas (2nd) and Björnsson (3rd). The 2014 contest was one of the closest battles in WSM history, with these three men separated by just two points going into the Atlas Stones. Savickas clinched the title by just half a point ahead of Björnsson, and just 3 ahead of Shaw, becoming the fourth man to win four titles. This victory made Savickas the oldest athlete to ever win the title at the age of 38 years and 8 months.

Shaw would defeat Savickas once again in 2015, with the title coming down to the two of them in the final event for the 4th time. Björnsson finished on the podium yet again, with Britain&#x27;s Eddie Hall coming in 4th. Savickas didn&#x27;t compete in 2016, as Shaw successfully defended his title and joined Savickas on four titles. Björnsson made a fifth podium finish as the runner up, as Hall continued his steady rise to finish 3rd, despite placing last in the first event.

In the 2017 contest, two four-time winners Brian Shaw and Žydrūnas Savickas competed head-to-head for the first time since the 2015 contest, but Eddie Hall won his first title over runner-up Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson by 1 point and was the first person to win for the UK since Welshman Gary Taylor in 1993. Hall also set a new strongman deadlift world record with a regular bar at performed with just straps.

Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson won the 2018 after three 2nd place and three 3rd place finishes and became the first Icelander since Magnús Ver Magnússon in 1996 to win the title. Mateusz Kieliszkowski of Poland finished second and four-time winner Brian Shaw of the United States third. Žydrūnas Savickas, also a four-time winner, finished tenth after withdrawing in event four due to an injury.

The 2019 contest was held in Bradenton, Florida. The contest was won by Martins Licis of the United States who defeated defending champion Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson of Iceland. Björnsson suffered an injury, plantar fasciitis, in the qualifying heats but was able to complete the competition and finish 3rd on the podium, with Mateusz Kieliszkowski finishing as the runner up for the second consecutive year. This year also saw brothers Tom and Luke Stoltman both qualify for the final, becoming the first brothers to both reach the final in history. A new format which included only 25 instead of 30 competitors was used and the entire competition only ran for 4 days instead of the usual 5+. The final was reduced to 5 events and took only one day. The new format was designed to streamline the editing for a quicker television turnaround.

===2020s===

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 contest, initially planned to be held in May at Bradenton, was postponed to November instead. In place from May through July was a special series called &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man: Home Edition&quot; on Snapchat Discover, where participating strongman athletes filmed themselves at home recreating strongman events in creative ways, and fans could vote for their favourites. The series was hosted by Eddie Hall. Rongo Keene was declared the winner, earning him a $10,000 prize.

The 2020 contest was to be held on Anna Maria Island from 11 to 15 November, with no physical spectators allowed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The competition also went back to the previous rules of 30 competitors in the groups and a six event final. Because of bad weather conditions brought about by Hurricane Eta, the first two days were instead pushed back a day, removing the rest day planned on 13 November. For the first time in WSM history, none of the podium finishers from the previous year (Mariusz Pudzianowski was originally a podium finisher in 2004 before failing a drugs test) would compete in the contest. (Both Licis and Kieliszkowski were injured, whereas Björnsson had retired to focus on his boxing match with Eddie Hall). The contest was won by Oleksii Novikov, who set a new partial deadlift record of 537.5 kg (1,185 lbs) during the finals. Tom Stoltman came in 2nd place winning three of six events, while Jean-François Caron came in 3rd.

The 2021 edition of the contest took place in Sacramento, California from 15 to 20 June. Defending champion Novikov failed to advance from his qualifying heat, after finishing 4th in a tightly fought group which saw just one point separating 1st and 4th position. Tom Stoltman would improve on his second place finish the year before to claim his first title after defeating four-time champion Brian Shaw head-to-head in the Atlas Stones, and became the first Scotsman to win the title. Shaw would finish second, his best placing since his 4th title in 2016, and his first podium finish since 2018, while Canada&#x27;s Maxime Boudreault would place third in his first WSM final.

The 2022 contest held in Sacramento again was shaping up to be one of the best contests yet, with 2019 champion Martins Licis returning, and 4 former champions in the competition. Unfortunately, Mateusz Kieliszkowski was once again forced to withdraw due to injury. Tom Stoltman successfully defended his title, winning by 10.5 points over Licis (in 2nd) and Oleksii Novikov, who placed 3rd despite winning three of the six events in the final.

The 2023 edition of the contest was held at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina for the first time. Mitchell Hooper continued his rapid rise after his debut the previous year and secured 1st Place with four events wins out of six in the final. 2 time Champion Tom Stoltman finished 2nd and 2020 Champion Oleksii Novikov came 3rd.

Tom Stoltman would reclaim his title of World&#x27;s Strongest Man with three event wins in the final at the 2024 contest, which was held once again at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. He also became one of 7 men to hold the title at least 3 times. Previous champion Mitchell Hooper finished 2nd and Evan Singleton came 3rd.

== Competition format and commonly contested events ==

Initially, eight men representing various sports and strength disciplines were invited to compete against each other in unique events designed to test each individual to the fullest extent. The earliest events were relatively crude, but new ideas were introduced over the years. Some events had a basis in both powerlifting and Highland Games heavy events, and others were created based on mythological feats of strength. There are a number of events that make up each competition.

* Loading Medley – Several heavy objects, each weighing , are carried/ dragged and loaded onto a truck bed or a similar platform over a course of about .
* Atlas Stones – Five heavy round stones increasing in weight in the range of are lifted and set on platforms. When the stones were first introduced to the competition, it was an individual event and the platforms were all of equal height. The modern Atlas Stones event takes place on a long course and the competitors participate two at a time. There are three current variations to the Atlas Stones event. In one, the stones are placed directly in front of the platforms and the competitors must simply lift and place them, generally the lightest stone being placed on the highest platform. In another, the stones are placed in a diagonal line, with the first stone being in front of the first platform, and each subsequent stone is set farther back from the course, with the heaviest stone being farthest away (or vice versa). The third variation sees the five platforms in a straight vertical line with the stones in front of each, and the competitors must place the stones and then move a short distance to the next one. In recent competitions, this is typically the final event. In the 2015 competition, the heaviest stone was 209 kilos (461 lbs).
* Vehicle pull – Vehicles such as transport trucks, trams, boxcars, buses, or planes are pulled across a course as fast as possible. One variation sees the competitors pull the object with a rope toward them. Another has them attached to a rope which is attached to a vehicle, while they use another rope to pull themselves down the course. A third involves no ropes, with the competitors pulling the vehicle while connected to a harness. The 2007 competition featured pulling a fire truck (possibly a nod to 2006 champion Phil Pfister, a professional firefighter) and the 2008 qualifying rounds featured a coal truck (a reference to the coal mining industry in West Virginia, where the competition was held).
* Overhead Press – The heaviest possible load is pressed overhead, or a lighter weight is used for repetitions.
* Fingal&#x27;s Fingers – A series of hinged poles (&quot;fingers&quot;) are lifted starting from a horizontal resting position and flipped over to the other side. The poles get progressively heavier and longer. The event is scored by time and by how many of the poles a competitor was able to flip over. The event takes its name from Fingal, a mythological Gaelic hunter-warrior.
* Power Stairs – A series of three Duck Walk implements ranging from are lifted, step by step, to the top of a flight of stairs.
* Squat – Squatting large weights, such as of bricks, a car, or people on a platform. Recently, an apparatus has been used that drops weighted kegs into a cage, one at a time after each successful lift (the event, in this case, is scored by weight instead of repetitions). The athlete will continue until completion, failure or time expires.
* Dead Lift – Lifting weights or vehicles up to about straight off the ground until knees lock in a standing position. Lift is for either maximum weight, maximum repetitions with a fixed weight, or for time whilst holding a single repetition. In recent years, a similar keg-loaded apparatus to that described above for the squat has been used.
* Keg Toss – Competitors must throw kegs, of increasing weight, over a high bar. A variation using kettlebells was added to the 2015 competition, while in 2017, gold bricks were used.
* Weight over bar – A weight is thrown overhead with the goal being to clear a barrier above the competitor. The goal is to throw the weight the highest.
* Bar bending – Competitors have to grip long iron rods from their edges, use their arm and grip strength, and bend until the two ends come closer to each other.
* Car Carry – Competitors stand inside a stripped-down automobile, which is missing some of its roof and all of its bottom and interior, and carry it across a course. Competitors are scored by time, then distance once the time-limit expires.
* Hercules Hold – The athlete stands between two hinged pillars, gripping handles that prevent the pillars from falling to the side. The pillars are held for the longest possible time.
* Carry and Drag – An anchor and a chain are carried to the end of a set distance, where they must be attached to each other and then dragged back the same distance.
* Farmer&#x27;s Walk – Competitors carry heavy objects (usually anvils) weighing from 275 to 375 lbs (125 to 170 kg) in each hand for a set distance, and compete for the fastest time. A variation involves the use of a heavy frame with parallel handles or heavy objects attached to handles, and another involves much heavier weights (referred to as the Giant Farmer&#x27;s Walk). This event is usually done on the same course as the Carry and Drag and is conducted as a race, but one competition in Sanya, China saw the competitors compete individually carrying the weights up a small set of stairs. The 2001 competition saw the competitors race two at a time along a course requiring several turns.
* Super Yoke – Apparatus composed of a crossbar and two uprights. The uprights each have a heavy weight attached to them, such as a refrigerator or diesel engine, and the competitors must carry the yoke on their shoulders for a short distance.
* Husafell Stone – A flat, somewhat triangular lifting stone weighing around 410 lb (186 kg) is carried high on the chest for a set distance or for overall distance within a time limit. The stone is named for a famous one in Iceland, which actually was brought out for use when the competition was held in Iceland. During some years which the competition took place in Africa, this event was known as the Africa Stone and the stone was in the shape of the continent as it appears on a map. The 2017 competition called this event the Elephant Carry, and the stone was shaped like the head and face of an African elephant.
* Duck Walk – An object with a handle is carried, suspended between the legs, over a set course.
* Log Throw / Caber toss – A five-meter-long ( foot) log is thrown for distance or for height over a bar. When thrown for distance, the event is conducted similarly to the normal caber toss but with distance replacing technique. The length of the throw is determined by measuring the distance between where the competitor&#x27;s toes were when he tossed and the tip of the log, based on where it first landed.
* Tug of War – One on one tug of war in a single-elimination tournament. In the first few competitions, this determined the champion and served as the final event.
* Pole Pushing – One on one pole pushing in a Sumo-style ring in a single-elimination tournament. The pole has handles at either end.
* Crucifix – Weights are held straight out at each side for as long a time as possible. A common variation entails weights being held out in front, using either one or both hands. 
* Giant Dumbbell Press – Single-handed dumbbells are hoisted from the ground onto the competitor&#x27;s shoulder, from where, with one hand, he must raise it vertically over his head and lockout his arm. With four weights between , scoring is based on time and number of successful lifts.
* Basque Circle/Stone Circle/Conan&#x27;s Wheel – A competitor takes hold of the handle of a metal basket by placing the handle on his forearms. Inside the basket, usually, is at least of heavy stones (the 2015 WSM replaced the stones with pineapples and at least one earlier competition used a car). Holding the basket in the crook of his elbow, the competitor carries the basket in a clockwise manner over a platform with a circumference. The event is contested for distance. 
*Norse Hammers – Added to the competition for the first time in 2015, the Norse Hammers is similar to the Fingal&#x27;s Fingers event. Three hammers, shaped like those of Norse god Thor, must be flipped over. Unlike the Fingal Fingers, the competitors must lift the hammer from the side before pushing it up. There are three hammers, weighing 350, 365, and 380 pounds, respectively. In order to complete the event, all three hammers must be flipped within the time limit.
*Circus Barbell – Similar to the Overhead Press, this event gets its name from the apparatus used which resembles the classically shaped barbell used by circus strongmen. The barbell, which weighs , consists of two heavy spheres with a thick, flexible bar that makes it difficult for the competitors to lift. The event is conducted for reps within a time limit and the movement to complete the lift resembles a clean and press lift.

Beginning in 2017, the qualifying format was changed. After five events, the leader clinches a spot in the final while the last place competitor is eliminated from the competition. To determine the second finalist of the group, a new event called Last Man Standing was added. An Atlas Stone is placed at the center of an octagon and, one at a time, the competitors must lift the stone and drop it over a 55-inch metal bar. They each have twenty seconds to do this, and once one cannot complete the drop, he is eliminated and the next highest scoring competitor entering the event takes his turn. The competition continues in stepladder fashion, beginning with the fourth and fifth place competitors, until only one remains; that competitor is declared the winner of the event and secures the second place in the final for the qualifying group.

The 2018 competition used the Atlas Stones event to determine the second finalist. The three lowest scorers were eliminated from the competition, and the second and third place finishers squared off with the winner advancing to the final.

The 2019 competition saw the return of Last Man Standing, but instead of featuring the remaining four competitors, only the second and third place competitors square off to determine the second finalist.

<text>The Ioffe Physical-Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (for short, Ioffe Institute, ) is one of Russia&#x27;s largest research centers specialized in physics and technology. The institute was established in 1918 in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg) and run for several decades by Abram Ioffe. The institute is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. As of June 2024 the Ioffe Institute employed 1977 individuals including both scientific and non-scientific staff.

== Present structure of the institute ==
As of 2019, the Ioffe institute employed about 1500 people, around 1000 of whom were scientific researchers (including 560 with a PhD degree and 250 with a Doktor Nauk degree). 
Most of the research staff members are top graduates of the St. Petersburg (former Leningrad) universities.

From 2013 until mid-May 2018 the Ioffe institute was under formal jurisdiction of the Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO Russia), now it is under jurisdiction of the established in May 2018 Ministry of Science and Higher Education, like all other institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS).

The institute is organized into five divisions:
* Center for Nano-Heterostructure Physics
* Solid State Electronics
* Solid State Physics
* Plasma Physics, Atomic Physics and Astrophysics
* Physics of Dielectrics and Semiconductors
Each of the divisions includes several laboratories. The institute has its own graduate school and a scientific council. There exists an intensive collaboration with the research and industrial establishments in Russia and worldwide.

The institute publishes five scientific journals: &quot;Semiconductors&quot; (), &quot;Physics of the Solid State&quot; (), &quot;Optics and Spectroscopy&quot; (), and &quot;Technical Physics&quot; (journal + letters) ()).

== Founding of the institute ==
The foundation date of the Ioffe Institute is September 23, 1918 – the day of signing the decree on the establishment of the physical and technical department in the (established in March of the same year) State Roentgenological and Radiological Institute in Petrograd. Despite tremendous economic problems after the World War I and the October Revolution (1917), the development of science was one of the priorities of the new Communist government.
The abovementioned department was headed by A. F. Ioffe. In 1922, on its basis, the State Physicotechnical Radiology Institute has emerged. After several reorganizations and renaming, since 1933, the institute became “Leningrad Physicotechnical Institute”. The form “Physicotechnical” is a Russian variant for “Physical &amp; Technical”. Three decades later, in the 1960s, the word “Ioffe” was added to the institute name, in honor of the first director.

Since 1939, the institute has been a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (since 1991 – of the Russian Academy of Sciences). In 1967, it was awarded the Order of Lenin. These details were reflected in the institute name, especially in Russian. Also now, for historical reasons, there remained the entrance plaque (s. photo): “Academy of Sciences of the USSR, A. F. Ioffe Physicotechnical Institute, awarded the Order of Lenin” ().

Presently, in English texts, for example in scientific papers, the name “[А. F.] Ioffe [Physical-Technical] Institute [of the Russian Academy of Sciences]” is used (the optional fragments are enclosed in square brackets).

== Main scientific achievements ==
The Ioffe Institute is considered the cradle of Soviet physics. Such outstanding scientists as L. D. Landau, P. L. Kapitsa started their career here, many physicists — among them Y. B. Zeldovich, I. V. Kurchatov, I. E. Tamm — have worked at the institute for some time.

The research of the institute covers nearly all fields of the contemporary physics, including the solid-state, semiconductors, quantum electronics, astrophysics, plasma, fluid dynamics, cosmology, nuclear synthesis.

More than 100 employees of the institute were recognized by awarding the highest prizes and orders of the Soviet Union and of Russia – in particular the Lenin and State Prizes of the USSR, State Prizes of Russia, Government prizes and special prizes of the Soviet/Russian Academy of Sciences.

Twice, the Nobel Prize was awarded for the works performed at the Ioffe Institute. In 1956, academician N. N. Semyonov (together with C. N. Hinshelwood) got the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for a discovery and study of chain reactions: the works were made and published in 1927, when N. N. Semyonov was a staff member of the institute. In 2000, Zh. I. Alferov, director of the Ioffe Institute at that time, became a Nobel Prize laureate in Physics (together with H. Kroemer and J. Kilby) for the development of semiconductor heterostructures for high-speed optoelectronics.

The Ioffe Institute has played a central role in the development of photovoltaic solar power in Russia and internationally, and thus in the development of renewable energy.

== Buildings ==
The main building of the Ioffe Institute (s. photo at the top of the article and the very left part of the photo below) is located at Polytechnicheskaya Street, 26. It was built in a Neoclassicism style in 1912–1916 by the architect G. D. Grimm and served as &quot;a refuge for the elderly needy hereditary noblemen in commemoration of the 300th anniversary of the Romanovs&#x27; house&quot; at the forty-prized ones, on the second floor they arranged Church (now the Small Assembly Hall of the institute).
In 1920 the building was adapted to the institute by the design of civil engineers P. I. Sidorov and Yu. V. Bilinsky. The ceremonial transfer of the building to the institute took place on February 4, 1923. Until 1953, the apartment of A. F. Ioffe was located in the same building. In the years 1927–1928 there appeared a yard part, and in 1970 the building was reconstructed and expanded along Kurchatov Street.

Beyond this historical building, a more modern building on another side of the Kurchatov Street (the right part of the photo) also belongs to the Ioffe Institute. It was constructed in the 1970s. Furthermore, some laboratories of the Ioffe Institute are placed in Shuvalovo, a north-west outskirts of St. Petersburg.

In front of the main facade are the busts of Abram Ioffe (sculptor G. D. Glickman, 1964) and Boris Konstantinov (sculptor Mikhail Anikushin, 1975). On either side of the main entrance are memorial plaques: to the left of the entrance are S. N. Zhurkov, Yulii Borisovich Khariton, Anatoly Alexandrov, Yakov Frenkel, and ; right of the entrance - Igor Kurchatov, B. P. Konstantinov, Nikolay Semyonov.

<text>Johannes Kreisler is the name of a character in three novels by E.T.A. Hoffmann: &quot;Kreisleriana&quot; (1813), &quot;Johannes Kreisler, des Kapellmeisters Musikalische Leiden&quot; (1815), and &quot;The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr together with a fragmentary Biography of Kapellmeister Johannes Kreisler on Random Sheets of Waste Paper&quot; (1822). He appears briefly in &quot;The Golden Pot&quot; (1814) and in some of Hoffmann&#x27;s journalism as well.

The moody, asocial composer Kreisler, Hoffmann&#x27;s alter ego, is a musical genius whose creativity is stymied by an excessive sensibility. The character inspired Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Kreisleriana&quot; for piano, op. 16 (1838), and the first movement of György Kurtág&#x27;s &quot;Hommage à R. Sch.&quot; op. 15/d (merkwürdige Pirouetten des Kapellmeisters Johannes Kreisler), for clarinet, viola, and piano. In the manuscript of Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Variations on a Theme by Schumann&quot;, Op. 9, he marked each variation with a B for Brahms or a Kr for Kreisler, modeling this practice on the two alter egos Schumann created for himself, &quot;Florestan&quot;, which for Schumann represented the passionate and outgoing side of his nature and &quot;Eusebius&quot;, the withdrawn, reflective side. Brahms&#x27;s identification with his alter ego &#x27;Johannes Kreisler Junior&#x27; would continue until at least 1860, with a number of manuscripts being dedicated to this alias and with the composer often being addressed as such by his friends Julius Otto Grimm and Joseph Joachim.

<text>Patrick Esposito Di Napoli (January 18, 1964 – November 13, 1994) was a musician and member of the Quebec musical band Les Colocs, for which he played harmonica.

==Early life and education==
Di Napoli was born to a family of Italian descent in Perpignan, in the Pyrénées-Orientales département in France.

==Career==
He started making music in the 1970s, sometimes writing his own lyrics and melodies. For a time he lived with other musicians in an artist&#x27;s loft in Montreal.

Di Napoli wrote the song &quot;Séropositif Boogie&quot;, which appeared on the band&#x27;s first album in 1993, about living with HIV. He contracted the virus from knowingly using a tainted needle to inject heroin. He died on November 13, 1994, of complications from AIDS.

Les Colocs paid homage to him by using pictures of him during live shows. They dedicated their final album, &quot;Dehors novembre&quot; (November Begone) (1998), to Di Napoli. It is considered their best album. The title track, written by lead singer Dédé Fortin, expressed the point of view of a dying man, and was later used as the soundtrack to Patrick Bouchard&#x27;s animated short film &quot;Dehors novembre&quot;.

He was portrayed by Dimitri Storoge in the 2009 film &quot;Through the Mist (Dédé, à travers les brumes)&quot;.

<doc id="944032" wikidata="Q2796580" url="?curid=944032" title="Jason Lee Scott">
<text>Jason Lee Scott is a fictional character in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, played by actor Austin St. John. Jason is known as the first on screen Red Ranger from the first on screen series, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, as well as the leader of the first on screen team of Power Rangers. He later becomes the temporary Gold Ranger in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;. He once again becomes the Red Ranger by &quot;Power Rangers: Beast Morphers&quot;, alongside his original team. A reimagined version of Jason appears in the 2017 reboot film, played by Australian actor Dacre Montgomery.

==Fictional character history==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;===
Jason is a martial artist from the fictional town of Angel Grove, California. At the beginning of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, he and his closest friends Zack Taylor, Billy Cranston, Trini Kwan and Kimberly Hart are selected by Zordon and Alpha 5 as the five &quot;teenagers with attitude&quot; to become the original Power Rangers and defend Earth from the forces of the evil Rita Repulsa. When Zordon first confronts the teens to give them their powers, Jason is the only one who initially believes him. Jason becomes the Red Power Ranger and is given the Dinozord Power Coin of the Tyrannosaurus, obtains the Tyrannosaurus Dinozord (a colossal assault vehicle) and is made the team leader. He leads the Rangers into many battles against Rita&#x27;s monsters, establishing a rivalry with Rita&#x27;s number one henchman Goldar.

When Tommy Oliver comes in, he becomes competitive rivals with Jason, matching him in a martial arts competition. Rita then manipulates Tommy, turning him into the evil Green Ranger and sends him into battle. He later captures Jason, steals his Power Morpher and imprisons him in Rita&#x27;s Dark Dimension where he would have to fight Goldar to retrieve his Morpher. The Green Ranger eventually arrives at the scene with orders to destroy Jason, but Billy, Trini and Alpha manage to repair the damage Tommy did to the Command Center, in time to find Jason and retrieve him seconds before Tommy kills him. Later, Jason squares off with Tommy on Earth and ends up finally disarming him and then uses his Blade Blaster to destroy the Sword of Darkness that Rita had given to Tommy, due to the sword&#x27;s ability to maintain her evil spell on him. The team then convinces Tommy to join the team and use his powers against Rita.

Later, Rita crafts a Green Candle out of special wax that had been enchanted with Tommy&#x27;s touch when he was evil. Once lit, the candle continues to burn until it is gone and when it is, so too would Tommy&#x27;s powers. Because Tommy&#x27;s proximity to the candle accelerates the candle&#x27;s melting process, Tommy is captured and placed close to it by Goldar. However, he eventually escapes and Jason is left to retrieve the candle.

Following the failure of destroying the Green Candle, Tommy entrusts Jason with his Power Coin to prevent it from falling into Rita&#x27;s hands again, allowing him access to the Green Ranger&#x27;s powers (including the Dragon Shield and the Dragon Dagger, which also allows him to call the Dragonzord to aid the Rangers, even while Jason controls the Megazord).

Later, Jason plays a gambit against Goldar, who had kidnapped the parents of Angel Grove High&#x27;s students, then ransoms them for the Ranger&#x27;s five Power Coins. Jason would later reveal that though he gave up his Tyrannosaurus Power Coin to Goldar, he kept the Dragon Power Coin. With it, Tommy eventually regains his Green Ranger powers, retrieves the other Ranger&#x27;s Power Coins and helps the team save their captive parents.

When Lord Zedd arrives and overruns Rita, he sends his new brand of Putty Patrollers to Earth. The Putties possess superior strength to Rita&#x27;s Putties, the team discovers to hit the Z to destroy them. To compete with their new enemy&#x27;s more powerful monsters, the Dinozords are upgraded into the mythical Thunderzords; Jason&#x27;s Dinozord becomes the Red Dragon Thunderzord, which can transform into a humanoid form. As with the Tyrannosaurus, the Red Dragon can defeat a monster on its own, separate from the Megazord formation.

Eventually, Tommy loses his Green Ranger powers again, and Jason suffers from immense guilt because of it. Choosing to capitalize on Jason&#x27;s vulnerability, Zedd creates candles for Zack, Billy, Trini and Kimberly that would remove their links to the Morphing Grid, just as Rita did to Tommy. Jason, with the help of Zordon&#x27;s confidence in him, manages to save his friends and prevent them from losing their powers. Following the victory, Jason wins a martial arts trophy and dedicates it to Tommy, who soon after returns as the White Ranger and is named the new leader of the team by Zordon. Tommy&#x27;s comeback relieves Jason&#x27;s guilt towards him and accepting him as his successor as the team&#x27;s leader and becoming the new second-in-command. Tommy still heavily relied on Jason due to his experience, as shown where he asks for Jason&#x27;s help because he is struggling to defeat Nimrod the Scarlett Sentinel, Jason then comes to Tommy&#x27;s aid and together with the other Rangers they beat the Nimrod.

Some time later, Jason, Trini and Zack are chosen to act as ambassadors at a Peace Conference in Switzerland (after the actors playing the characters left the show over contract disputes, the characters simply being shown in their Ranger uniforms, using old footage, or with doubles who were never directly facing the cameras, until the transfer could be incorporated into the plot of the show), and are forced to leave the team. Zordon chooses Rocky DeSantos to replace Jason as the Red Ranger.

===&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;===

Jason returns in &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, taking over the powers of the Gold Zeo Ranger temporarily from Trey of Triforia when Trey was injured in a fight with Varox bounty hunters and required someone else to hold his powers until he could heal. Jason is also chosen by Tanya to become the guardian of Auric the Conqueror for a time. He dates a local waitress, Emily (Lesley Pedersen).

Jason returns the Gold Ranger powers to Trey in the final episode of &quot;Zeo&quot; when he finds out that he cannot handle it much longer, as they are draining away - along with his life force - due to the Gold Ranger powers not being intended for human physiology. However, there are no apparent long-term effects, and Jason appears perfectly healthy after he transfers it back to Trey.
Jason and Kimberly both return in &quot;Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie&quot;. The film throughout suggests they may be romantically linked, having gotten together sometime after Jason&#x27;s turn as the Gold Ranger. They are first seen scuba diving together, but are then kidnapped by the villainess Divatox and are briefly brainwashed to fight against the Turbo Rangers. It appears that the evil influence enhanced his own emotional aspects, as at one point he taunts Tommy with &quot;Now I&#x27;m the one with the muscles and the power!&quot;. After being restored to normal by Lerigot, he once again fades into the background, with Jason&#x27;s appearance in the film being replacing the injured Rocky in a martial arts tournament and ultimately winning the match, alongside Tommy and Adam. At the end of the match, Jason can be seen celebrating and holding hands with Kimberly. In the credits- Jason and Kimberly can be seen hugging.

===&quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot;===
Jason returns in &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot;, in the special episode &quot;Forever Red&quot;, which celebrated the tenth anniversary of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. In this special, he utilizes his original Red Ranger powers and joins nine other Red Rangers (which includes Tommy, but not Rocky, as Jason is the Mighty Morphin Red Ranger of the episode) to defeat the remnants of the Machine Empire, a force of villains that Jason had previously battled as the Gold Zeo Ranger. After the events of &quot;Forever Red,&quot; Jason returns to living a normal life, though he presumably still retains his Red Ranger powers.

===&quot;Power Rangers Super Megaforce&quot;===
Jason and the other Mighty Morphin Power Rangers return as part of the army of Legendary Rangers led by Tommy that helped the Mega Rangers defeat the Armada once and for all, fighting in a huge battle against hundreds of XBorgs and dozens of Bruisers. However, Austin St. John did not return and Jason only appears morphed, as do the other Mighty Morphin rangers besides Tommy.

===&quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;===
Jason returns in Season 2 of &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;, in the special episode &quot;Grid Connection&quot;.

When Jason&#x27;s old foe Goldar is reanimated by Evox/Venjix as Goldar Maximus and dispatched to the dimension of the Dino Charge Power Rangers to gather energems, Jason is summoned by Grid Battleforce Red Ranger Devon to help him save the Dino Charge Rangers as well as members of Devon&#x27;s own team. It is revealed that Jason&#x27;s Tyrannosaurus Power Coin has laid dormant within a meteorite for an undisclosed amount of time. Devon hands the coin back to Jason. The MMPR main team and the Dino Thunder Power Rangers come back to assist him against the army led by Goldar Maximus.

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Once &amp; Always&quot;===
Jason was part of the reunited Mighty Morphin team who fought Robo-Rita in the battle that ended with Trini&#x27;s death. He, Tommy, Kimberly, and Billy are attacked again when they gather in the anniversary of Trini&#x27;s passing, with a revived Snizard imprisoning all but Billy and Zack. Robo-Rita plans on using their powers as a power source for her latest invention, a machine that opens a portal to the past so she can pass on her knowledge to her younger self and more easily take over the Earth. After the villains and the machine are destroyed, Jason as well as a handful of other captured Rangers, are released. Because St. John had his passport suspended for his alleged illegal activities, he did not reprise his role, so Jason does not appear unmorphed except in archive footage.

==Other versions==
=== &quot;Power/Rangers&quot; (2015 short film) ===
Jason (played by Stevin Knight) In this darker reimagining. After the Machine Empire defeats the Power Rangers and destroys the Megazord in battle, Earth&#x27;s governments negotiate a truce with the Machine Empire, and the Power Rangers are disbanded. Jason marries Kimberly Hart, and their marriage lasted eight hours until Farkas Bulkmeier and Eugene Skullovitch seemingly revealed their location to the police force. Jason is killed in the crossfire.

===2017 film===
Jason appears as the main protagonist (arguably alongside Kimberly and Billy) in the 2017 reboot film, played by Australian actor Dacre Montgomery. A former high school football star, Jason ruins his potential career when he pulls a prank by bringing a bull into the school&#x27;s changing room, leaving him sentenced to weekend detentions until the end of the year. He also gains a knee injury for his right leg when he flips his truck during an escape attempt on that fateful night. After he protects Billy Cranston from a bully during the detention, Billy helps Jason shut down his house arrest ankle monitor in return for driving Billy out to the old mines where Billy used to go with his father, resulting in them discovering the Power Coins at the same time as Kimberly, Trini and Zack are in the area. When they experience sudden bursts of strength and speed, (along with having Jason&#x27;s knee heal overnight), the five return to the place where they found the coins and discover Zordon and Alpha 5 in the spaceship buried underground. Although skeptical at the story presented by Zordon, Jason soon accepts his role as leader and works to rally the team, even daring to confront Rita Repulsa when they have yet to master their powers. This attack on Rita results in Billy&#x27;s death, but the sight of the team coming together prompts Zordon to selflessly sacrifice a chance to return to life and instead resurrect Billy, allowing the new Rangers to battle Rita after Zordon&#x27;s team failed. He even wields a sword that once belonged to Zordon, and saves his dad&#x27;s life without revealing his identity. Jason and Kimberly are hinted to romantically interested in each other in this adaptation with a deleted scene of a kiss between them confirming this.

===Comics===
Jason appeared in numerous comic books by Marvel Comics and Papercutz.

Jason also appears in the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; comic from Boom Studios. This version of Jason is shown to have romantic interest in Trini Kwan (Yellow Ranger) and briefly Lauren Shiba (second Red Samurai Ranger).

Jason also has a parallel universe doppelgänger, who not only has the Red Ranger powers but also the White Ranger&#x27;s. This Jason was an archenemy of Lord Drakkon, who is an evil parallel universe doppelgänger of Tommy Oliver. Lord Drakkon ultimately killed his world&#x27;s Jason and takes his enemy&#x27;s White Ranger powers and Red Ranger helmet as trophies, and eliminates their world&#x27;s Power Rangers.

When Lord Drakkon mounted a mass attack on every Ranger team in history, Jason eventually found himself acting as leader of the forces arrayed against Drakkon, using the Dragon Shield and the Dragonzord as he issued commands to the Rangers from the future. In the process, he also formed a relationship with Lauren Shiba, the surviving Red Ranger of the Samurai Rangers, but the conclusion of this storyline erased Drakkon&#x27;s attack from history, with the result that Jason and Lauren&#x27;s relationship was also erased.

Later in the series, Jason, Trini and Zack leaving for the &quot;Peace Conference&quot; is revealed to be a cover story for their new role as the Omega Rangers, using ancient powers to act as agents for the Morphing Masters to track down residual damage caused by Drakkon&#x27;s attack. During this time, Jason and his team have to protect the Earth Rangers from an enemy that seeks to punish Tommy for Drakkon&#x27;s actions, unable to acknowledge that Tommy has passed the point when he would become Drakkon. After a confrontation with Astronema and Ecliptor, Jason&#x27;s time as the Red Omega Ranger comes to an end when he is possessed by the spirit of the Gold Omega, which was released by Andros in an attempt to save Zhane from his current comatose state, only to learn too late that the Gold Omega Ranger seeks to basically cause a zombie apocalypse. The only way to defeat the Gold Omega Ranger forces Jason to sever his connection to the Omega powers, leaving him unable to morph into the Red Omega Ranger again, passing his powers on to Trini while he returns to life on Earth.

<doc id="944036" wikidata="Q1251370" url="?curid=944036" title="Stadion Oosterpark">
<text>Oosterpark Stadion () was the stadium of football club FC Groningen until December 2005. The all-seater stadium in Groningen&#x27;s Oosterpark neighbourhood was inaugurated on 30 September 1933 and renovated in 1960, 1984 and 1987/88. The stadium has been replaced by the new, larger Euroborg stadium, and the ground it occupied is being redeveloped.

The stadium&#x27;s peak capacity was 22,000 spectators (in 1985). At the time of the demolition, the capacity was 11,224.

Clubs that played in the stadium earlier are BRC, GVAV Rapiditas and De Oosterparkers. The best visited game ever was FC Groningen - Servette FC with 19,500 spectators.

On 22 December 2005, the last match of FC Groningen in the stadium took place, the KNVB Beker match against FC Volendam. The supporters made a very last trip from the Grote Markt in Groningen with torches and fireworks. The match ended in a 3–0 victory for FC Groningen, and the last goal in the Oosterpark was scored by Glen Salmon.

The stadium in Groningen hosted two international matches of the Netherlands national football team in the early 1980s, both won by the home side 3-0. The first one was a qualifying match for 1982 FIFA World Cup on 22 February 1981 against Cyprus with goals scored by Hugo Hovenkamp, Cees Schapendonk and Dick Nanninga; this match was notable because Hovenkamp and Nanninga were players who were born in the Oosterpark-area of Groningen. The second and the last one was a qualifying match for Euro 1984 on 7 September 1983 against Iceland with goals scored by Ronald Koeman, Ruud Gullit and Peter Houtman.

<text>Color printing or colour printing is the reproduction of an image or text in color (as opposed to simpler black and white 
or monochrome printing).

==History of color printing==
Woodblock printing on textiles preceded printing on paper in both East Asia and Europe, and the use of different blocks to produce patterns in color was common. The earliest way of adding color to items printed on paper was by hand-coloring, and this was widely used for printed images in both Europe and East Asia. Chinese woodcuts have this from at least the 13th century, and European ones from very shortly after their introduction in the 15th century, where it continued to be practiced, sometimes at a very skilled level, until the 19th century—elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were hand-colored by boys until 1875. Early European printed books often left spaces for initials, rubrics and other elements to be added by hand, just as they had been in manuscripts, and a few early printed books had elaborate borders and miniatures added. However this became much rarer after about 1500.

===East Asia===
Traditional East Asian printing of both text and images used woodblock printing, effectively the same technique as woodcut in the West, and printing in a number of colors by using multiple blocks, each inked in a different color, was known from early on.

====China====
British art historian Michael Sullivan writes that &quot;the earliest color printing known in China, and indeed in the whole world, is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346&quot;. Color prints were also used later in the Ming Dynasty. In Chinese woodblock printing, early color woodcuts mostly occur in luxury books about art, especially the more prestigious medium of painting. The first known example is a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606, and color technique reached its height in books on painting published in the seventeenth century. Notable examples are Ming-era Chinese painter Hu Zhengyan&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio&quot; of 1633, and the &quot;Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden&quot; published in 1679 and 1701, and printed in five colors.

====Japan====

In Japan, color woodcuts were used for both sheet prints and book illustrations, though these techniques are better known within the history of prints. The &quot;full-color&quot; technique, called nishiki-e in its fully developed form, spread rapidly, and was used widely for sheet prints from the 1760s on. Text was nearly always monochrome, and many books continued to be published with monochrome illustrations sumizuri-e, but the growth of the popularity of &quot;ukiyo-e&quot; brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques. By the nineteenth century most artists designed prints that would be published in color. Major stages of this development were:

*&quot;Sumizuri-e&quot; (墨摺り絵, &quot;ink printed pictures&quot;) - monochrome printing using only black ink
*&quot;Tan-e&quot; (丹絵) - monochrome sumizuri-e prints with handcoloring; distinguished by use of orange highlights using a red pigment called &quot;tan&quot;
*&quot;Beni-e&quot; (紅絵, &quot;red pictures&quot;) - monochrome sumizuri-e prints with handcoloring; distinguished by use of red ink details or highlights. Should not be confused with &quot;benizuri-e&quot;, below.
*&quot;Urushi-e&quot; (漆絵) - a method in which glue was used to thicken the ink, emboldening the image; gold, mica and other substances were often used to enhance the image further. This technique was often used in combination with hand coloring. &quot;Urushi-e&quot; can also refer to paintings using lacquer instead of paint; lacquer was very rarely if ever used on prints.
*&quot;Benizuri-e&quot; (紅摺り絵, &quot;crimson printed pictures&quot;) - images printed in two or three colors, usually containing red and green pigments, as well as black ink. This printing technique should not be confused with &quot;beni-e&quot;, above. Both &quot;beni-e&quot; and &quot;benizuri-e&quot; are so named for the predominant reddish colorants, derived from dyes of the safflower plant (beni 紅).
*&quot;Nishiki-e&quot; (錦絵, &quot;brocade pictures&quot;) - a method in which multiple blocks were used for separate portions of the image, allowing a number of colors to be utilized to achieve incredibly complex and detailed images; a separate block would be carved to apply only to the portion of the image designated for a single color. Registration marks called &quot;kentō&quot; (見当) were used to ensure correspondence between the application of each block.

Further developments followed from refinements of technique and trends in taste. For instance:

*&quot;Aizuri-e&quot; (藍摺り絵, &quot;indigo printed pictures&quot;), &quot;Murasaki-e&quot; (紫絵, &quot;purple pictures&quot;), and other styles in which a single color would be used in addition to, or instead of, black ink. These are specialty techniques that grew in popularity in the nineteenth century, though a few examples can be seen earlier.

===Europe===

Most early methods of color printing involved several prints, one for each color, although there were various ways of printing two colors together if they were separate. Liturgical and many other kinds of books required rubrics, normally printed in red; these were long done by a separate print run with a red forme for each page. Other methods were used for single-leaf prints. The chiaroscuro woodcut was a European method developed in the early 16th century, where to a normal woodcut block with a linear image (the &quot;line block&quot;), one or more colored &quot;tone blocks&quot; printed in different colors would be added. This was the method developed in Germany; in Italy only tone blocks were often used, to create an effect more like a wash drawing. Jacob Christoph Le Blon developed a method using three intaglio plates, usually in mezzotint; these were overprinted to achieve a wide range of colors.

In the 19th century a number of different methods of color printing, using woodcut (technically Chromoxylography) and other methods, were developed in Europe, which for the first time achieved widespread commercial success, so that by the later decades the average home might contain many examples, both hanging as prints and as book illustrations. George Baxter patented in 1835 a method using an intaglio line plate (or occasionally a lithograph), printed in black or a dark color, and then overprinted with up to twenty different colors from woodblocks. Edmund Evans used relief and wood throughout, with up to eleven different colors, and latterly specialized in illustrations for children&#x27;s books, using fewer blocks but overprinting non-solid areas of color to achieve blended colors. English Artists such as Randolph Caldecott, Walter Crane and Kate Greenaway were influenced by the Japanese prints now available and fashionable in Europe to create a suitable style, with flat areas of color.

Chromolithography was another process, which by the end of the 19th century had become dominant, although this used multiple prints with a stone for each color. Mechanical color separation, initially using photographs of the image taken with three different color filters, reduced the number of prints needed to three. Zincography, with zinc plates, later replaced lithographic stones, and remained the most common method of color printing until the 1930s.
== Modern techniques ==
=== CMYK ===
Color printing involves a series of steps, or transformations, to generate a quality color reproduction. The following sections focus on the steps used when reproducing a color image in CMYK printing.

Any natural scene or color photograph can be optically and physiologically dissected into three primary colors, red, green and blue, roughly equal amounts of which give rise to the perception of white, and different proportions of which give rise to the visual sensations of all other colors. The additive combination of any two primary colors in roughly equal proportion gives rise to the perception of a secondary color. For example, red and green yields yellow, red and blue yields magenta (a purple hue), and green and blue yield cyan (a turquoise hue). Only yellow is counter-intuitive.
Yellow, cyan and magenta are merely the &quot;basic&quot; secondary colors: unequal mixtures of the primaries give rise to perception of many other colors all of which may be considered &quot;tertiary&quot;.
While there are many techniques for reproducing images in color, graphic processes and industrial equipment are used for the mass reproduction of color images on paper. In this sense, &quot;color printing&quot; involves reproduction techniques suited for printing presses capable of thousands or millions of impressions for publishing newspapers and magazines, brochures, cards, posters and similar mass-market items. In this type of industrial or commercial printing, the technique used to print full-color images, such as color photographs, is referred to as four-color-process or merely process printing. Four inks are used: three secondary colors plus black. These ink colors are cyan, magenta, yellow and key (black); abbreviated as CMYK.

Cyan can be thought of as minus-red, magenta as minus-green and yellow as minus-blue. These inks are semi-transparent (translucent). Where two inks overlap on the paper due to sequential printing impressions, a primary color is perceived. For example, yellow (minus-blue) overprinted by magenta (minus green) yields red. Where the three inks may overlap, almost all incident light is absorbed or subtracted, yielding near black, but in practical terms it is better and cheaper to use a separate black ink instead of combining three colored inks. The secondary or subtractive colors cyan, magenta and yellow may be considered &quot;primary&quot; by printers and watercolorists (whose basic inks and paints are transparent).

Two graphic techniques are required to prepare images for four-color printing. In the &quot;pre-press&quot; stage, original images are translated into forms that can be used on a printing press, through &quot;color separation&quot; and &quot;screening&quot; or &quot;halftoning&quot;. These steps make possible the creation of printing plates that can transfer color impressions to paper on printing presses based on the principles of lithography.

A method of full-color printing is six-color process printing (for example, Pantone&#x27;s Hexachrome system) which adds orange and green to the traditional CMYK inks for a larger and more vibrant gamut, or color range. However, such alternate color systems still rely on color separation, halftoning and lithography to produce printed images. Six color printing is widely used to increase the printability and so that to increase the production.

An emerging method is extended gamut printing or 7 color printing which adds three more colors such as green, orange and violet to extend the printability or gamut so that a wide range of Pantone colors also can be reproduced without changing the ink settings. This method is also called OGV printing. The digital inkjet printers such as EPSON SureColor series has been using this method successfully to reproduce 99% Pantone colors.

Color printing can also involve as few as one color ink or color inks which are not the primary colors. Using a limited number of color inks, or color inks in addition to the primary colors, is referred to as &quot;spot color&quot; printing. Generally, spot-color inks are formulations that are designed to print alone, rather than to blend with other inks on the paper to produce various hues and shades. The range of spot color inks, much like paint, is nearly unlimited and much more varied than the colors that can be produced by four-color-process printing. Spot-color inks range from subtle pastels to intense fluorescents to reflective metallics.

==Modern process==

===Color separation process===
Typically color separation is the responsibility of the color separator. This includes cleaning up the file to make it print ready and creating a proof for the prepress approval process. The process of color separation starts by separating the original artwork into red, green, and blue components (for example by a digital scanner). Before digital imaging was developed, the traditional method of doing this was to photograph the image three times, using a filter for each color. However this is achieved, the desired result is three grayscale images, which represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) components of the original image.

The next step is to invert each of these separations. When a negative image of the red component is produced, the resulting image represents the cyan component of the image. Likewise, negatives are produced of the green and blue components to produce magenta and yellow separations, respectively. This is done because cyan, magenta, and yellow are subtractive primaries which each represent two of the three additive primaries (RGB) after one additive primary has been subtracted from white light.

Cyan, magenta, and yellow are the three basic colors used for color reproduction. When these three colors are variously used in printing, the result should be a reasonable reproduction of the original, but in practice this is not the case. Due to limitations in the inks, the darker colors are dirty and muddied. To resolve this, a black separation is also created, which improves the shadow and contrast of the image. Numerous techniques exist to derive this black separation from the original image; these include grey component replacement, under color removal, and under color addition. This printing technique is referred to as CMYK (the &quot;K&quot; stands for &quot;key&quot;, a traditional word for the black printing plate).

Today&#x27;s digital printing methods do not have the restriction of a single color space that traditional CMYK processes do. Many presses can print from files that were ripped with images using either RGB or CMYK modes. The color reproduction abilities of a particular color space can vary; the process of obtaining accurate colors within a color model is called color matching.

===Screening===
Inks used in color printing presses are semi-transparent and can be printed on top of each other to produce different hues. For example, green results from printing yellow and cyan inks on top of each other. However, a printing press cannot vary the amount of ink applied to particular picture areas except through &quot;screening,&quot; a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots, rather than solid areas, of ink. This is analogous to mixing white paint into a color to lighten it, except the white is the paper itself. In process color printing, the screened image, or halftone for each ink color is printed in succession. The screen grids are set at different angles, and the dots therefore create tiny rosettes, which, through a kind of optical illusion, appear to form a continuous-tone image. You can view the halftoning, which enables printed images, by examining a printed picture under magnification.

Traditionally, halftone screens were generated by inked lines on two sheets of glass that were cemented together at right angles. Each of the color separation films were then exposed through these screens. The resulting high-contrast image, once processed, had dots of varying diameter depending on the amount of exposure that area received, which was modulated by the grayscale separation film image.

The glass screens were made obsolete by high-contrast films where the halftone dots were exposed with the separation film. This in turn was replaced by a process where the halftones are electronically generated directly on the film with a laser. Most recently, computer to plate (CTP) technology has allowed printers to bypass the film portion of the process entirely. CTP images the dots directly on the printing plate with a laser, saving money, and eliminating the film step. The amount of generation loss in printing a lithographic negative onto a lithographic plate, unless the processing procedures are completely ignored, is almost completely negligible, as there are no losses of dynamic range, no density gradations, nor are there any colored dyes, or large silver grains to contend with in an ultra-slow rapid access negative.

Screens with a &quot;frequency&quot; of 60 to 120 lines per inch (lpi) reproduce color photographs in newspapers. The coarser the screen (lower frequency), the lower the quality of the printed image. Highly absorbent newsprint requires a lower screen frequency than less-absorbent coated paper stock used in magazines and books, where screen frequencies of 133 to 200 lpi and higher are used.

The measure of how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called dot gain. This phenomenon must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images. Dot gain is higher on more absorbent, uncoated paper stock such as newsprint.

<doc id="944052" wikidata="Q7883229" url="?curid=944052" title="Under color addition">
<text>In four-color printing (or more), under color addition (UCA) is a technique for darkening areas of the printed image by adding colored inks. It is meant to achieve the same results as under color removal, but from a different starting position.

Under color removal replaces colored inks in selected areas with black ink to achieve a darker appearance, whereas with under color addition, small portions of the three colors are added to these areas instead of, or in addition to, using black ink.

UCA is used to reduce the speckle effects of dithering, especially with very light colors. Without UCA, a very light grey would consist of infrequent black specks that might be individually noticeable. With UCA, the specks are lighter and 3x more numerous.

Printer drivers sometimes make the use of UCA somewhat configurable, disabling it when set to a mode intended to save ink.

Anyone creating artwork for print output should be wary of using UCA. Used incorrectly, the effects can render a poorly printed image, yielding the problems associated with rich black. On the other hand, UCA can improve a flat image, adding depth and richness to the shadows.

UCA is generally best used in conjunction with under color removal - in order to remove some, but not all CMY ink from black areas.

<text>Bud is a fishing village in Hustadvika Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county in western Norway. The village is located on the Romsdal peninsula along the Atlanterhavsveien road, west of the village of Hustad, north of the village of Tornes, and east of the Bjørnsund islands. Bud Church is located in the village.

The village has a population (2018) of 795 and a population density of .

The village was the administrative centre of the old Bud Municipality, which existed from 1838 until 1964 when it was merged into Fræna Municipality. The old municipality encompassed the northern part of the present-day Fræna Municipality.

==History==

Due to a good natural harbor and rich fisheries, Bud grew to become the largest village between the towns of Trondheim and Bergen on the west coast of Norway during the Middle Ages.

At the death of King Frederick I in 1533, it was the site of the last independent Norwegian Privy Council, organized by Olav Engelbrektsson, Archbishop of Nidaros. The meeting led to a failed attempt to break away from the Kalmar Union and King Christian III, and claim Norway&#x27;s independence by rejecting the Protestant Reformation. The council was the last of its kind in Norway for 270 years.

In 1838, the whole parish of Bud was established as Bud Municipality. The municipality was reduced in size in 1918 when Hustad Municipality was created.

During World War II, the Germans heavily fortified Bud and the nearby Hustadvika coastal area in anticipation of an Allied invasion, as a part of the Atlantic Wall.

In 1964, Bud Municipality was dissolved when it was merged into Fræna Municipality.

<doc id="944058" wikidata="Q1421299" url="?curid=944058" title="Grey component replacement">
<text>Within the CMY color space used in color printing, a range of colors can be achieved by combining the three primary colors. This combination can be thought of as a hue component (which will require a maximum of two primary colors) and a grey component (a mixture of all three, in an appropriate quantity to give the required saturation). If the grey component is replaced by black ink, the same color is being achieved by using two primaries and black. The substitution of black for the grey component is described as grey component replacement (GCR).

In GCR, contrary to under color removal (UCR), the CMY values that add to grey all along the tone scale can be replaced with black ink. UCR only adds black to the CMY equivalent of what would have printed as a grey or near-grey.

==Advantages==

* GCR uses less ink overall, and a larger proportion of the ink is black, which is normally cheaper than the others.
* The areas where less ink is used are regions of high ink use, so the potential problems of drying and ink set-off are reduced.
* The resulting output is less susceptible to changes in the printing variables since not as much C, M, and Y require balancing.

==Disadvantages==

There may be potential quality issues associated with GCR. Sometimes it reduces the ability to adjust colors. It may create problems with balancing black halftone. A high amount of GCR causes the shadow areas to print too weakly, giving a low-contrast image.

<text>Pordenone (; Venetian and ) is a city and (municipality) in the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the capital of the Regional decentralization entity of Pordenone.

The name comes from Latin , meaning &quot;port on the Noncello River&quot;.

==History==

Pordenone was created at the beginning of the High Middle Ages as a river port on the Noncello, with the name &quot;Portus Naonis&quot;. In the area, however, there were already villas and agricultural settlements from the Roman age, especially in the area of the town of Torre.

Between 1257 and 1270 Pordenone was conquered by Ottokar II of Bohemia, who was eventually defeated in 1277, when the city was brought back to the Empire, under Rodolph I of Habsburg.

In 1278, after having been administered by several feudatories, the city was handed over to the Habsburg family, forming an Austrian enclave within the territory of the Patriarchal State of Friuli. In the 14th century, Pordenone grew substantially due to the flourishing river trades, gaining the status of city in December 1314.

In 1508, after the failed invasion of the Republic of Venice by Emperor Maximilian, the city was seized by Venice. Despite temporary Austrian occupation during the subsequent War of the League of Cambrai (1509–16), the Venetian sovereignty over Pordenone was confirmed in 1516. Until 1537, the town was ruled by the feudal family d&#x27;Alviano, as a reward for Bartolomeo d&#x27;Alviano&#x27;s military service to the Republic. Under Venice a new port was built and the manufacturers improved.

After the Napoleonic period, Pordenone was included in the Austrian possessions in Italy (Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia). The railway connection, including Pordenone railway station (1855), and the construction of the Pontebbana road brought on the decline of the port, but spurred substantial industrial development (especially for the working of cotton). Pordenone was annexed to Italy in 1866.

The cotton sector decayed after the damage of World War I and failed completely after the 1929 crisis. After World War II, the local Zanussi firm became a world giant of household appliances, and in 1968, Pordenone became capital of the province with the same name, including territory belonging to Udine.

After World War II, Pordenone, as well as the rest of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, became a garrison for many military units, in order to prevent a socialist Yugoslavian invasion from the east.

The heavy military presence boosted the economy of the once-depressed area.

Pordenone is as now garrison of the 132nd Armored Brigade &quot;Ariete&quot;.

==Geography==
The territory of Pordenone is located in the lowlands of the Po-Venetian Valley, south of Venetian Prealps and the Alpine foothills of Friuli.

The lowlands of Pordenone is characterized by an abundance of water and by the &quot;phenomenon&quot; of resurgence.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen climate classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfa&quot; (Humid Subtropical Climate).

==Demographics==
=== Local languages and dialects ===
In ancient times, the Friulian language was spoken in Pordenone. Under the Venetian rule the Venetian language – closer to modern standard Italian – was subsequently introduced in a form which developed into the modern days Pordenone dialect. The town is surrounded by Friulian-speaking communities (though Venetian features can be found there as well).

However, Friulian is protected in town in accordance with the Regional Law of December 18, 2007, n. 29, &quot;Norms for the protection, promotion and enhancement of the Friulian language&quot;.

=== Ethnic minorities ===
Foreign citizens living in Pordenone amount to 7,025 persons, making 13.7% of the town population. The ten largest ethnic minorities are listed as follows:
# , 1,810
# , 931
# , 823
# , 346

<text>Polocrosse is a team sport that is a combination of polo and lacrosse. It is played outside, on a field (the pitch), on horseback. Each rider uses a cane or fiberglass stick to which is attached a racquet head with a loose, thread net, in which the ball is carried. The ball is made of sponge rubber and is approximately four inches across. The objective is to score goals by throwing the ball between the opposing team&#x27;s goal posts.
==International Polocrosse Council (IPC)==

==Rules==
Unlike polo, players are allowed only to play one horse, except in the case of injury. There is no restriction on the horse&#x27;s height, although polocrosse horses are generally smaller than 16hh. Horses of all breeds play polocrosse and the Australian Stock Horse is the most popular breed playing in Australia. Stallions are not permitted to play.

A team consists of six players, divided into two sections of three who each play either 2, 3 or 4 chukkas of six to eight minutes, depending on the rules of the tournament, with the two sections from each team alternating on and off the field each chukka. A match comprises four, six or eight chukkas. The three players in each section play the position of a No. 1, attack, a No. 2, midfield (a combination of defence and offence), or a No. 3, defence.

The team structure was designed to force players to pass the ball about amongst themselves, making it a better skilled, faster sport.

The field is , with three separate areas. The goal scoring areas, on each end, are 30 yards long. Only the No. 1 of the attacking team and the No. 3 of the defending team can play in these areas.

The middle area is 100 yards long. The line separating the goal scoring and centre areas is called the penalty or thirty-yard line. Goal posts are eight feet apart. To score, the ball must be thrown from outside an 11-yard semicircle in front of the goal.

Players can pick up the ball from the ground, catch it in their racquet, and ride with it. They throw it to other players until the No.1 has possession in the goal scoring area. A player cannot carry the ball over the penalty line, but must bounce it so that they do not have possession of it while actually crossing the line. It can also be passed to a player over the line.

When carrying the ball, a player must carry it on the stick side, i.e. right-handed players must carry it on the offside of the horse (if a person has possession of the ball and crosses the racket over the centre-line of the horse (the line that runs from the horses ears to the tail) it is a foul). A player can, however, pick-up or catch the ball on the non-stick side provided they immediately bring it back to their stick side.

Each chukka begins with a line up at a central spot on the side boundary line in centre field. The players from each team line up in single file, facing the umpire at the edge of the field, with the No. 1s in front, followed by the 2&#x27;s and then the 3&#x27;s. The umpire then throws the ball between the players, between shoulder and racket height so that all players have a chance to catch the ball. The teams always line up on the defensive side of one another.

The game recommences similarly after a goal has been scored, with the line up taking place on the alternate side of the field for every goal that is scored. Whenever an attempt at goal fails (i.e. a missed shot at goal), the No. 3 is awarded a 10-yard throw from the 30-yard line.

The most common award given in the case of a penalty is a 10-yard throw. Where the foul occurred determines the position on the field at which the throw is taken. Depending on the nature of the penalty, the 10-yard throw may be taken at the spot where the penalty occurred or it may be moved down the field to the next 30-yard line to advantage the fouled team. For example, if the team carrying the ball is fouled, the penalty will most likely be moved down the field to give advantage to the fouled team, however if the team carrying the ball commits the foul the ball may just be turned over to the other team at the point where the foul occurred.

Not all fouls are punished with a ten-yard throw. Particularly dangerous fouls (such as hitting another player in the head or helmet with the racket) result in a free goals being awarded. If a player continues to commit fouls after being cautioned by the umpire, commits a particularly dangerous or intentional foul, or generally behaves dangerously, the umpire can dismiss the player from the field.

If both teams are responsible for a penalty, or if the ball goes out of bounds after being deflected off a horse, the game is restarted with a line up. If the penalty occurs when the ball is in the end zone, the umpire will call a line up from within the area, between the attacking 1 and defending 3 players. If the penalty occurs when the ball is in centre field the game is restarted with a line up at the nearest sideline.

It is also illegal to ride through the goal posts, if any player&#x27;s horse steps all 4 legs through the posts, it is an automatic free goal to the opposing team.

Players can get the ball from the opposition by hitting at an opponent&#x27;s stick in an upwards direction only, with the swing starting from below the horses quarters when swing is forward, or below the horses withers when the swing is backward. This is done either to dislodge the ball or to prevent the opposition from gaining possession of it. This is called &quot;giving wood&quot;. Riding off is also allowed, but crossing, stopping, or turning on the ball, or elbowing all constitute fouls. Sandwiching one player between two others also constitutes a foul.

==History==
The modern game was developed in Australia before the Second World War. In 1938 Mr. and Mrs. Edward Hirst of Sydney read an article in an English horse magazine on polocrosse. As both were keen on horse breeding and horse sports they decided to find out more about it when they got to England. On arrival, they visited the National School of Equitation at Kingston Vale near London, where two instructors had developed an exercise to supplement the work at the riding school and help young riders take better charge of their horses.

The exercise was played indoors with two riders a side and markers on the wall from which the ball bounced back into play. The goals were elongated basketball nets hung at each end of the arena. The sticks were old polo sticks that had the polo mallet removed and replaced with a squash racquet head. This had a shallow string net, which they used to scoop up the ball. The idea was to scoop up the ball, which was a little larger than a tennis ball, ride with it to the end of the arena and drop it into the net to score.

Realising the possibilities of this exercise as an outdoor horse sport, the couple returned to Australia with sticks, balls and rule books and sought the assistance of Alf Pitty, a well-known horseman and polo player.

After many hours of discussion, practising, much trial and error and revision of the rules, they finally came up with a new game using only one horse and able to be played by a person of any age. They called the new game polocrosse.

After all their careful designing, Pitty then helped to give the first recorded polocrosse demonstration at Ingleburn Sports Ground near Sydney in 1939. Interest and enthusiasm was so great that it was not long before all the club members were practising this new game. A short time later in 1939 a meeting was called at Ingleburn to form the first polocrosse club. At this meeting the first book of the rules of the game was established. Burradoo was the next polocrosse club to be established in Australia and is now the longest running club in Australia.
In 1962 Walcha became the first club team to win the Lennon trophy at the Australian Red Cross championships at Maitland, when the four Goodwin brothers, Paul, Maurice, Noel and Brian together with Bob Gill and John Nixon played as the North New England No 1 team.

Polocrosse in South Africa started in the early 1950s. The first international tour of South Africa was in 1968 by Rhodesia and followed by the Australians in 1971. Polocrosse finally made it back to the United Kingdom in 1978, when it was introduced to two branches of the Pony Club in Surrey. It continued to be played at Pony Club level, with its popularity slowly growing. The arrival of polocrosse players from Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and South Africa in the UK in the early 1980s led to the establishment of polocrosse clubs outside of the Pony Club, and in 1985 the UK Polocrosse Association was formed. Polocrosse became an official Pony Club activity with its own championship at around the same time. Polocrosse is also played in Finland, France, Germany, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Norway, the Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Zimbabwe, United Kingdom, Zambia, Italy and South Africa.

== Polocrosse in Ireland ==

In 1990 polocrosse came to Ireland. Brothers David and Ivor Young introduced polocrosse to Ireland in 1990 as an additional tourism attraction to their residential equestrian holiday business in County Wexford. David had just read an article on Polocrosse in a UK equestrian magazine. Interested to learn more about this game, the two brothers had an Australian coach, Bernie Uechtritz, at Horetown House some five weeks later. In the early stages, the game was only played at Horetown House, County Wexford, but it was not long before Brian McMahon of Rathcannon in County Limerick heard about this new game, and Limerick Polocrosse Club was the next club to be established. From here polocrosse expanded rapidly in Ireland, with several other clubs springing up, including Tipperary (based in Clonmel, County Tipperary), Carrickmines (based in South Dublin), Waterford (based in Tramore, County Waterford), Birr (Based in Birr, County Offaly), Cork (based in Middleton, County Cork) and three new recent additions: Silverspurs (based in South County Dublin), Tyrella (based in Tyrella, County Down) and Equus (based in South Dublin).

<text>Irwin Allen (born Irwin O. Cohen; June 12, 1916 – November 2, 1991) was an American film and television producer and director, known for his work in science fiction, then later as the &quot;Master of Disaster&quot; for his work in the disaster film genre. His most successful productions were &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). He also created and produced the popular 1960s science-fiction television series &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, and &quot;Land of the Giants&quot;.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Irwin Allen was born in New York City, the son of poor Jewish immigrants (Joseph Cohen and Eva Davis) from Russia. He majored in journalism and advertising at Columbia University after attending City College of New York for a year. He left college because of financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression.

===Radio and journalism===
Allen moved to Hollywood in 1938, where he edited &quot;Key&quot; magazine followed by an 11-year stint producing his own program at radio station KLAC. The success of the radio show led to him being offered his own gossip column, &quot;Hollywood Merry-Go-Round&quot;, which was syndicated to 73 newspapers.

He produced his first TV program, a celebrity panel show also called &quot;Hollywood Merry-Go-Round&quot; with announcer, and later &quot;Tonight Show&quot; host, Steve Allen (no relation), before moving into film production.

===RKO===
Allen became involved in film production at a time when power was beginning to shift from studios to talent agencies. He put together packages consisting of directors, actors, and a script, and sold them to film studios.

Allen&#x27;s first film as producer was &quot;Where Danger Lives&quot; (1950) with Robert Mitchum, directed by John Farrow and written by Charles Bennett. Allen produced it with Irving Cummings, Jr. The two men made two more films for RKO: &quot;Double Dynamite&quot; (1951) with Jane Russell, Groucho Marx, and Frank Sinatra, and &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot; (1952), again with Marx and William Bendix.

Allen made his directorial debut with the documentary, &quot;The Sea Around Us&quot; (1953). This was based on Rachel Carson&#x27;s best-selling book of the same name. It largely used stock footage and won the 1952 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. Carson was so disappointed with Allen&#x27;s final version of the script that she never again sold film rights to her work. The film includes gory images of whales being killed. It was a success, making a profit over $2 million.

Allen returned to producing with the three-dimensional film &quot;Dangerous Mission&quot; (1954), his final film for RKO. It starred Victor Mature, Bendix, Piper Laurie, and Vincent Price.

===Warner Brothers===
Allen directed a semidocumentary about the evolution of life, &quot;The Animal World&quot; (1956). Again, making use of stock footage, but he also included a 9-minute stop-motion dinosaur sequence by Ray Harryhausen. Before release, he toned down the gore from both the live action and the animation.

The film was released by Warner Bros. So was Allen&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; (1957), a very loose adaptation of the Hendrik Willem van Loon book of the same name. It featured cameos from the Marx Brothers, Ronald Colman, Hedy Lamarr, Vincent Price, and Dennis Hopper. The actors were each paid $2,500 (equal to $ today) for a single day&#x27;s work with Allen relying on stock footage for the rest of the film.

Allen co-wrote (with Bennett) and produced &quot;The Big Circus&quot; (1959) for Allied Artists Pictures with Mature, Red Buttons, Peter Lorre, and Price. Allen was interested in making &quot;an exciting, colorful show – something the public can&#x27;t see on television.&quot; Allen was fascinated by circuses as a child and briefly worked as a carnival barker at age 16. In addition to &quot;The Big Circus&quot;, he worked circus-themed episodes into his TV programs &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; and would try for years to get a widescreen, 3-D project called &quot;Circus, Circus, Circus&quot; into theaters.

===20th Century Fox===
====Films as director====
Allen then went to 20th Century Fox, where he co-wrote (with Bennett), produced, and directed three films: &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1960), from the novel by Arthur Conan Doyle, &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961), and &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot; (1962).

Willis O&#x27;Brien, who had also worked on the pioneering special effects of the original &quot;Lost World&quot; (1925) and &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933) films, was disappointed when Allen opted to save time by using live alligators and lizards instead of stop-motion animation for the film&#x27;s dinosaurs. &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; was a scientifically dubious, Jules Verne-style adventure to save the world from a burning Van Allen belt. It was the basis for his later television series of the same name. The family film, &quot;Five Weeks in a Balloon&quot;, was a loose adaptation of the Verne novel. &quot;Lost World&quot; was a moderate hit and &quot;Voyage&quot; was very successful. &quot;Five Weeks&quot; was a box-office disappointment.

====Television series====
With 20th Century Fox scaling back their film productions due to their huge expenditure on films such as &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), in the mid-1960s, Allen concentrated on television, producing several overlapping science-fiction series for 20th Century Fox Television. They featured special effects by L. B. Abbott, who won three Emmys for his work. Allen used many of the same craftsmen on his TV shows as he did on his films, including composer John Williams and costume designer and general assistant Paul Zastupnevich.

&quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (ABC TV, 1964–1968) established Allen&#x27;s reputation as a television producer. The financial viability of the series was assisted by the reuse of many of the sets from the film; the cost of the &quot;Seaview&quot; submarine sets alone exceeded the budget of a typical pilot show of the era. The series also benefited from Allen&#x27;s by-now notorious use of stock film footage, particularly from &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; (1954), &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957), and Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

Allen had originally intended &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (CBS TV, 1965–1968) to be a family show, a science-fiction version of &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot;. It quickly developed into a children&#x27;s show with episodes concentrating on the young Will Robinson, the robot, and especially, the comic villain, Dr. Smith. The show used several science-fiction elements that have since become common, such as the comic robot (e.g. &quot;Silent Running&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;) or android (&quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;), the heroic child (Meeno Peluce in &quot;Voyagers!&quot;, Wesley Crusher), and the wacky, lovable alien (Albert in &quot;Alien Nation&quot;, Vir in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;).

&quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (ABC TV, 1966–1967), with each episode set in a different historical time period, was an ideal vehicle for Allen&#x27;s talent for smoothly mixing live action with stock footage from films set in the same period. A change in network management led to the show being cancelled after just one season. Allen cited &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; as his favorite of all of his television productions and he would attempt to revamp and relaunch the concept numerous times including a filmed pilot in 1976 called &quot;The Time Travelers&quot; and unfilmed concepts that included one called &quot;Time Travel Agency&quot; and another called &quot;The Time Project&quot; that went through several incarnations.

&quot;Land of the Giants&quot; (ABC TV, 1968–1970) was the most expensive show of its day at roughly $250,000 per episode. As another castaway-themed show, Allen incorporated some of the successful elements from &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, although this time he did not allow the treacherous character to dominate the series.

====Television films ====
Allen also produced several television films, such as &quot;City Beneath the Sea&quot;, which recycled many props and models from &quot;Voyage&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space,&quot; and &quot;The Man from the 25th Century&quot;. Though intended as a pilot for a new TV series project, his small-screen success from the 1960s largely eluded him in the 1970s.

&quot;Lost in Space&quot;″s Bill Mumy said of Allen that, while he was very good at writing television pilots that sold, his unwillingness to spend money hurt his shows&#x27; quality once on the air. A monster costume that appeared on one of his shows, for example, would appear on another a few weeks later with new paint. Writer Jon Abbott described Allen as paradoxical. &quot;Here was a man who, when told the cost of a spaceship for a &quot;Lost in Space&quot; alien, snapped, &#x27;Let him walk!&#x27; ... and then let the show be cancelled rather than take a cut in the budget&quot;.

In 1969, Allen signed a three-picture deal with Avco Embassy to make &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot;, &quot;No Man&#x27;s World&quot;, and &quot;Almost Midnight&quot;, but the deal did not lead to any films there.

====&quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;====
In the 1970s, Allen produced the most successful films of his career: &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974), directing the action scenes for both. Their showmanship was compared to that of P. T. Barnum and Cecil B. DeMille, and they prompted scholarly analysis of the subsequent popularity of the disaster genre.

&quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; was based on the Paul Gallico novel of the same name and directed by Ronald Neame. Unable to find a studio to fully back the venture, Allen raised half the $5 million budget, with 20th Century-Fox putting up the rest; the film eventually grossed over $100 million. L. B. Abbott and A. D. Flowers won a Special Achievement Academy Award for the film&#x27;s optical and physical effects.

Allen hoped to follow up on the success of &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; with a film based on the novel &quot;The Tower&quot;, but the film rights had already been taken by Warner Bros. He looked for an alternative and found a similar story in &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot;. Rather than produce competing movies, 20th Century-Fox and Warner Bros. agreed to coproduce &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; with a script based on both novels and a $14 million budget. It was the first time two major studios made a film together, splitting the costs. Despite its nearly three-hour run time, the film, directed by John Guillermin, was a hit and won three Academy Awards.

====Final television films for Fox====
The success of the films led to Allen receiving an offer to make three television films. &quot;I missed television&quot;, said Allen. &quot;There&#x27;s a hysteria and an excitement in television that exists nowhere else in business.&quot;

Each was made for Fox television at a budget of $1 million with a view to possibly going to series. They screened on different networks: &quot;Adventures of the Queen&quot; (1975), &quot;The Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1975), and &quot;Time Travelers&quot; (1976). Only &quot;Swiss Family&quot; was picked up for a series, running for 20 episodes.

===Return to Warner Bros.===
Allen left 20th Century Fox when a change in management in 1976 cancelled the remaining three planned disaster films, with incoming studio chief Alan Ladd, Jr. feeling that the disaster genre had run its course. Allen was offered a deal at Warner Bros. by Jon Calley, who built an office building for Allen. Allen continued to work there for the remainder of his career.

The rise of new filmmakers such as George Lucas reportedly caught him off guard. According to one book, the success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) bewildered him; he could not understand how a film with apparently no stars or love story could enrapture audiences so fervently.

Allen produced three made-for-TV disaster movies: &quot;Flood!&quot; (1976), &quot;Fire!&quot; (1977), and &quot;Hanging by a Thread&quot; (1979). He also made &quot;Viva Knievel!&quot; (1977), &quot;The Amazing Captain Nemo&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Memory of Eva Ryker&quot; (1980).

For theatrical release, he produced and directed the big-budgeted &quot;The Swarm&quot; (1978) and &quot;Beyond the Poseidon Adventure&quot; (1979), and produced &quot;When Time Ran Out&quot; (1980). These three films were back-to-back-to-back box office disappointments, with the final failure of &quot;When Time Ran Out...&quot; effectively ending his theatrical film career.

Allen also purchased the rights to several Marvel Comics characters including Daredevil, Black Widow and others for television adaptation in the 1980s; he commissioned a script for a &quot;Daredevil&quot; pilot from writer Stirling Silliphant, but the project never went before cameras.

&quot;No, I&#x27;m not going to run out of disasters&quot;, he said in a 1977 interview. &quot;Pick up the daily newspaper, which is my best source for crisis stories, and you&#x27;ll find 10 or 15 every day ... People chase fire engines, flock to car crashes. People thrive on tragedy. It&#x27;s unfortunate, but in my case, it&#x27;s fortunate. The bigger the tragedy, the bigger the audience.&quot;

===Final films===
Allen later went to Columbia to make a short-lived TV series, &quot;Code Red&quot; (1981–1982). His last films for Warner Bros. were &quot;The Night the Bridge Fell Down&quot; (1983) and &quot;Cave-In!&quot; (1979, though not released until 1983). Shortly before &quot;Cave-In!&quot; made its TV debut, Allen was awarded a Worst Career Achievement Golden Raspberry Award.

While at Columbia, Allen made a $14 million TV version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1985). His last credit was the TV movie &quot;Outrage!&quot; (1986).

Allen planned to make a star-studded musical of &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, but his declining health forced his retirement in 1986. He died in Los Angeles from a heart attack on November 2, 1991. He is buried in the Garden of Heritage 5, upper-level wall crypt 39J in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Irwin Allen rock-and-roll&quot; is when the camera is rocked as the on-screen cast rushes from side to side on the set, simulating a ship being tossed around. It is employed in many episodes of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. This camera technique was employed in the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode &quot;First Spaceship on Venus&quot;. Here, the camera tilts to simulate the spacecraft being hit. During this scene, Joel shouts out, &quot;Irwin Allen presents...&quot;.

Allen&#x27;s career in film and TV was the subject of a 1995 documentary, &quot;The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen&quot;, produced and directed by Kevin Burns, co-founder of Foxstar Productions, originally set up as the production unit responsible for creating a series of &quot;Alien Nation&quot; movies for television. Numerous cast members and associates from various Irwin Allen projects appeared in the film, lending recollections of their time working with him.

In 1994, while senior VP of Foxstar, Burns founded Van Ness Films, a nonfiction and documentary production unit. That same year, he met Jon Jashni, a Fox film executive who shared Burns&#x27; interest in Allen&#x27;s works. In 1998, the two collaborated on a TV retrospective special, &quot;Lost in Space Forever&quot;. Hosted by John Laroquette, it chronicled the series&#x27; creation and run on TV in the 1960s and beyond, and featured appearances by Bill Mumy, Jonathan Harris, June Lockhart, Angela Cartwright, Mark Goddard, and Marta Kristen, as well as film footage of vintage interviews with Guy Williams. Also appearing were Bob May, who donned the robot suit, and Dick Tufeld, who supplied the character&#x27;s voice. The flight deck set of the &quot;Jupiter 2&quot; spacecraft from the series was recreated as the backdrop for parts of the special.

It also was used as a vehicle to promote the 1998 &quot;Lost in Space&quot; film version of the original television series, starring William Hurt, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, Lacey Chabert, Mimi Rogers, and Heather Graham.

Burns and Jashni later formed Synthesis Entertainment, and began developing and producing remakes of, and sequels to, several Allen properties, including a 2002 Fox Television pilot for an updated version of &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;, which did not sell, and remakes of films including &quot;Poseidon&quot; (2006) and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. The 2002 TV pilot was included as a bonus feature on Volume 2 of Fox&#x27;s 2006 DVD release of the 30-episode &quot;Time Tunnel&quot; (1966–1967) TV series.

==In popular culture==
On January 3, 2008, BBC Four showed a night of Allen&#x27;s work which included the 1995 documentary &quot;The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen&quot; along with episodes of &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Land of the Giants&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;.

Episode 57 of the Disney TV series &quot;DuckTales&quot;, broadcast on December 8, 1987 and titled &quot;The Uncrashable Hindentanic&quot;, features a character called &quot;Irwin Mallard&quot; who films the destruction of Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s airship called the &quot;Hindentanic&quot; in the disaster movie style of Irwin Allen.

&quot;The Irwin Allen Show&quot; was a skit on &quot;SCTV&quot;. The Irwin Allen Show was a Johnny Carson–style talk show with Allen as the host. The guests were stars in Allen&#x27;s movies, and they were each individually victims of an Irwin Allen–style disaster while a guest on the talk show (e.g. Red Buttons was attacked by a swarm of bees).

In the film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; (2007) Linus Caldwell (played by Matt Damon) announces aloud to a catatonic Reuben Tishkoff that Rusty Ryan is doing an &#x27;Irwin Allen&#x27; which is a reference to the fake earthquake they stage later in the story.

American noise rock band Killdozer released a song about Irwin Allen&#x27;s work called &quot;Man vs. Nature&quot;.

The second half of &quot;Marge vs. the Monorail,&quot; often considered the best episode of the long-running animated comedy &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, is a parody of Irwin Allen&#x27;s disaster films.

<doc id="944085" wikidata="Q408469" url="?curid=944085" title="Airco DH.2">
<text>The Airco DH.2 was a single-seat pusher biplane fighter aircraft which operated during the First World War. It was the second pusher design by aeronautical engineer Geoffrey de Havilland for Airco, based on his earlier DH.1 two-seater.

The development of pusher configuration fighters, such as the DH.2 and the F.E.2b enabled forward firing armament before the development of synchronisation gears such as that fitted to the German Fokker Eindecker monoplane fighter. The prototype DH.2 made its first flight in July 1915, but it was lost during the following month, on its service trials on the Western Front.

The DH.2 was introduced to frontline service in February 1916 and became the first effectively armed British single-seat fighter. It enabled Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilots to counter the &quot;Fokker Scourge&quot; that had given the Germans the advantage during late 1915. It served in fighting and escort duties for almost two years, while numerous pilots became flying aces using the type. It became outclassed by newer German fighters, resulting in the DH.2&#x27;s eventual withdrawal from first line service in France after RFC units completed the process of re-equipping with newer fighters, such as the Nieuport 17 and Airco DH.5, in June 1917.

==Development==
By the outbreak of the First World War, aeronautical engineer Geoffrey de Havilland was already an experienced aircraft designer, having been responsible for the experimental Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.1, Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and Blériot Scout B.S.1, the B.S.1 being the fastest British aircraft of its day. In June 1914, de Havilland left the Royal Aircraft Factory for Airco, where he continued work on his own designs, the first being the Airco DH.1, which followed a similar formula to that of the F.E.2.

Early air combat over the Western Front indicated the need for a single-seat fighter with a forward-firing machine gun. At this point in time, there was no dominant approach to arming fighters, but a pusher configuration was one answer. As no means of firing forward through the propeller of a tractor aeroplane was yet available to the British, Geoffrey de Havilland designed the DH.2 as a scaled-down, single-seat development of the earlier two-seat DH.1. Aviation author J.M Bruce speculated that, had adequate synchronisation gear been available, de Havilland may have been less likely to pursue a pusher configuration.

While it is popularly viewed as a response to the emergence of Germany&#x27;s Fokker Eindecker monoplane fighters, its development was not specifically targeted at the type, having commenced prior to the Eindecker&#x27;s arrival. The first prototype DH.2 performed its first flight in July 1915. Following the completion of its manufacturing trials, on 26 July 1915, the prototype was dispatched to France for operational evaluation, but was lost over the Western Front and was captured by the Germans.

Despite the prototype&#x27;s premature loss, the DH.2 was ordered into quantity manufacture. The production aircraft was generally similar to the prototype with the only major alterations being a fuel system and a revised gun mounting arrangement. Deliveries of the DH.2 commenced during the latter half of 1915 and a handful of aircraft were reportedly operating in France prior to the year&#x27;s end. A total of 453 DH.2s were produced by Airco.

==Design==

The Airco DH.2 was a compact two-bay pusher biplane fighter aircraft. It had a wooden airframe, which was wire-braced and covered by fabric across most areas, except for the nacelle nose and upper decking. Both the upper and lower wings had ailerons fitted. The upper ailerons were spring-loaded to automatically return to a neutral position when the controls were released. The upper part of the nose of the nacelle was cut away so that a machine gun could be mounted there. Unusually, the windshield was mounted on the machine gun rather than to the airframe.

The DH.2 was armed with a single  Lewis gun which was mounted on a flexible mount. Once pilots learned that the best method of achieving a victory was to aim the aircraft rather than the gun, it was fixed to fire forward, although this was met with skepticism by higher authorities until a quick-release clip was devised at the Squadron level. The clip was devised by Major Lanoe Hawker, who also improved the gunsights and added a ring sight and an &quot;aiming off model&quot; that helped the gunner allow for leading a target.

The majority of DH.2s were powered by the Gnôme Monosoupape nine-cylinder, air-cooled rotary engine, however later models received the similarly configured but much improved Le Rhône 9J engine. Some sources state that the Monosoupape was retained in the DH.2 design despite a tendency to shed cylinders midair and a single DH.2 was fitted experimentally with a Le Rhône 9J. In addition to the variety of engines used, the fuel system also differed between individual aircraft. Typically, a gravity-fed fuel tank was used, but it could be located on the upper wing central section, or either above or below the port side upper wing.

==Operational service==
After evaluation at Hendon on 22 June 1915, the first DH.2 arrived in France for operational trials with No. 5 RFC Squadron but was shot down and its pilot killed during early August 1915. This aircraft was recovered and repaired by the Germans. The first squadron equipped with the DH.2, and the first RFC squadron completely equipped with single-seat fighters, No. 24 Squadron RFC, arrived in France early February 1916.

The DH.2 eventually equipped seven fighter squadrons on the Western Front and proved more than a match for the Fokker Eindecker and the first DH.2 victory over an Eindecker may have been on 2 April 1916. DH.2s were heavily involved in the Battle of the Somme with No. 24 Squadron engaging in 774 combats and claiming 44 enemy machines. Service training for pilots in the RFC was poor, and the DH.2 initially had a high accident rate, supposedly gaining the nickname &quot;The Spinning Incinerator&quot;, but as familiarity with the type improved, it was recognised as being maneuverable and relatively easy to fly.

The limited ammunition supply of the original gun installation proved to be inadequate. Although officially discouraged, pilots experimented with different gun arrangements, including a fixed twin-gun configuration. Furthermore, the original gun mounting was criticised for being loose and unstable, and it obstructed the stick when elevated. DH.2s were routinely flown with the guns fixed into position.

The arrival at the front of more powerful German tractor biplane fighters such as the Halberstadt D.II and the Albatros D.I, in late 1916, meant that the DH.2 was outclassed in turn. It remained in first line service until June 1917 in France, until No. 24 and No. 32 Squadron RFC reequipped with Airco DH.5s, and a few remained in service in Macedonia including &quot;A&quot; Flight of No. 47 Squadron and a joint R.F.C. / R.N.A.S. fighter squadron, and with &quot;X&quot; Flight, in Palestine until late 1917. By then, it was dangerously obsolete as a fighter. The DH.2 was then used as an advanced trainer and for other secondary tasks, with the last recorded use of a DH.2 being a single example flying at RAF Turnhouse in January 1919.

===Ace pilots===
Distinguished pilots of the DH.2 included Victoria Cross recipient Lanoe Hawker (seven victories, though none in the DH.2), who was the first commander of No. 24 Squadron. The commander of No. 32 Squadron, Lionel Rees was awarded the Victoria Cross after flying the D.H.2 for a solo attack on a formation of ten German two-seaters on 1 July 1916, destroying two. James McCudden became an ace in DH.2s and would become the British Empire&#x27;s fourth-ranking ace of the war. German ace and tactician Oswald Boelcke was killed during a dogfight with No. 24 Squadron DH.2s due to a collision with one of his own wingmen. Fourteen aces scored five or more aerial victories using the DH.2 and many also went on to further success in later types. Eight pilots scored all of their victories in the DH-2, including Harry Wood, Sidney Cowan, Hubert Jones, William Curphey, Maxmillian Mare-Montembault, Patrick Anthony Langan-Byrne, Eric Pashley and Selden Long. Lanoe George Hawker V.C., D.S.O., and commanding officer of No. 24 Squadron flying a DH. 2 was shot down by Manfred von Richthofen flying an Albatros D.II.

==Reproductions==

No original DH.2s exist. In 1970, Walter M. Redfern from Seattle, Washington built a replica DH.2 called the Redfern DH-2, powered by a Kinner engine. Redfern subsequently sold plans to home builders, and several of these replicas are flying. Redfern&#x27;s original replica is now displayed at the Omaka Aviation Heritage Centre in Blenheim, New Zealand.

<doc id="944086" wikidata="Q3025798" url="?curid=944086" title="Henry Clay Work">
<text>Henry Clay Work (October 1, 1832, Middletown – June 8, 1884, Hartford) was an American songwriter and composer of the mid-19th century. He is best remembered for his musical contributions to the Union in the Civil War—songs documenting the afflictions of slavery, the hardships of army life and Northern triumphs in the conflict. His sentimental ballads, some of which promoted the growing temperance movement, have also left their mark on American music. Many of Work&#x27;s compositions were performed at minstrel shows and Civil War veteran reunions. Although largely forgotten nowadays, he was one of the most successful musicians of his time, comparable to Stephen Foster and George F. Root in sales and sheer influence. In songwriting, he is renowned for his dexterity in African-American dialect, seriocomedy and melody.

Born to a Connecticutian family in 1832, Work&#x27;s upbringing was humble and unconventional. His father, Alanson, was an abolitionist who tirelessly strove to free fugitive slaves, for which he was briefly imprisoned. While a youth, Henry initiated a career in printing, one that lasted his entire life. Although lacking formal music training, his passion for song manifested itself early on as he wrote poems for newspapers. Work first published a complete musical piece in 1853, &quot;We Are Coming, Sister Mary&quot;. Its moderate success drove him to pursue songwriting further.

His career came of age at the Civil War&#x27;s outbreak; willing to contribute to the Union struggle, Work started writing patriotic tunes for Chicagoan publishing firm Root &amp; Cady. Impressed by &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; (1862), Root hired him for the war&#x27;s duration, during which he drove the business to unprecedented prosperity and produced some of the most memorable wartime songs, most notably, &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; (1865).

After the war, Work started venturing in balladry, his first being &quot;The Ship That Never Returned&quot; (1865). Upon returning from a European maritime voyage, familial and financial woes demotivated him considerably, worsened by Root &amp; Cady&#x27;s closure in 1871. He quit songwriting altogether for a few years. After agreeing to collaborate with Chauncey M. Cady in 1876, his output briefly resurged, yielding one sole major hit, &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot; (1876). Nonetheless, Work could not reproduce his wartime fame and fortune. He died virtually forgotten in 1884.

==Early life==
Henry Clay Work, named for distinguished statesman and former House speaker Henry Clay, was born on October 1, 1832, in Middletown, Connecticut. The Work family was of Scottish origin, their surname derived from Auld Wark, a significant stronghold during the Anglo-Scottish wars. To avert religious persecution, they migrated to the north of Ireland. Soon after, in 1720, Joseph Work emigrated to the United States, settling in Ashford, Connecticut. 
Henry Work&#x27;s background was modest, &quot;pass[ing] his boyhood days almost in want&quot; without much formal education. When aged just three, his father, Alanson, resettled the family near Quincy, Illinois, to better their fortunes. He was &quot;a noted and fearless anti-slavery advocate,&quot; organizing the family home into a station of the Underground Railroad, a network for fugitive slaves to escape to freedom. For aiding thousands of slaves flee from bondage, Alanson was sentenced to twelve years&#x27; hard labor in Missouri in 1841. He was conditionally pardoned four years later, forced to return to Connecticut and abandon the Railroad. Having spent much time with the freed slaves, the efforts of Henry Work&#x27;s father left a stirring impression on him. In his 1884 biography of the composer, Bertram G. Work remarked:

He became familiar with the African-American dialect and minstrelsy, and, above all, came to terms with slaves&#x27; routine agonies. Work grew to share his father&#x27;s staunch abolitionism, manifesting itself in his later compositions, many of which were endowed with &quot;a pronounced moralistic zeal.&quot;

While in Illinois, he attended irregular Latin and Greek courses at Mission Institute. These fostered a deep interest in philology; aged twelve, he noted his &quot;considerable progress&quot; in inventing two languages, &quot;one in which English letters were used to form new words, and one that had an alphabet of its own.&quot; In music, Work was largely self-taught, save for some lessons at a church singing school and exposure to camp meetings in his neighborhood. He quickly grew acquainted with the principles of musical notation, devising original melodies while laboring at the family pasture.

In 1845, obliged by the terms of Alanson&#x27;s release from prison, the Work family migrated back to Middletown, except for Henry who stayed a year longer. Then aged fourteen, he reluctantly commenced his apprenticeship as a tailor, but his father soon allowed him to pursue a career more &quot;congenial to his tastes&quot; in printing, specializing in typesetting music. Work never permanently strayed from this trade, that granted him further insight into the English language, indispensable for his songwriting ventures. In his spare time, his &quot;everyday thought&quot; of writing and music took effect, penning numerous poems, adapting them to melodies and contributing them to various newspapers.

==Early career==

=== Formative years ===
In 1853 Work composed his first song with original lyrics and melody, &quot;We Are Coming, Sister Mary&quot;. Instead of sending it to a gazette&#x27;s &quot;poet&#x27;s corner,&quot; he submitted it to Edwin P. Christy, founder of the renowned eponymous minstrel troupe based in New York City that had initiated Stephen Foster&#x27;s career. Christy was &quot;well pleased&quot; and later performed it at his shows, received with respectable praise and some popularity. He later sold it to the local publishing firm Firth, Pond &amp; Co. for the sufficient remuneration of $25 he bestowed to Work. This encouraged him to pursue &quot;more ambitious efforts as a composer,&quot; publishing a comic song, &quot;Lilly-Wily Woken&quot;, for the New York firm William Hall &amp; Son two years later.

While his career had been moderately fruitful so far, Work started doubting his songwriting capabilities. He passed the rest of the decade without publishing any music, choosing to focus exclusively on printing. For this reason he migrated to Chicago in 1855, aged twenty-three, and took up a new printing job. Two years later, he married Massachusettsan Sarah Parker and bought a cottage at Hyde Park. In March 1861, with his passion for songwriting revived, Work published a song commemorating the steamer &quot;Lady Elgin&quot;&#x27;s shipwreck, &quot;Lost on the Lady Elgin&quot;, meeting little success.

=== Background to his Civil War career ===

The following month, the American Civil War broke out, laying out a new path for Work&#x27;s aspirations. After the bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12–13, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the Southern rebellion. Music, which &quot;aroused herself to meet the exigencies of the times,&quot; was instrumental to raising the Union&#x27;s spirits, rallying civilians and troops, both White and Black, round their nation&#x27;s cause. Folk music enthusiast Irwin Silber notes:

Being in such high demand, patriotic song submissions began pouring into local newspapers and music labels, most of which were rather trite. It is estimated that approximately two thousand were published as sheet music in 1861 alone.

No firm attained such success in publishing Unionist music as Chicago-based Root &amp; Cady, &quot;the largest of [...] the era&quot; and &quot;most prolific producers of wartime music.&quot; It was established in 1858 by Ebenezer T. Root and Chauncey M. Cady and, from 1860 onwards, principally operated by George F. Root. Root was one of the most renowned composers of the Civil War era, with such tunes as &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; and &quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!&quot; to his name. By the war&#x27;s opening weeks, his firm was receiving roughly sixty daily submissions; throughout the conflict, it published over a hundred songs. In fact, it issued the very first Unionist composition, &quot;The First Gun is Fired!&quot;, in response to the attack on Fort Sumter. However, the Union still lacked much antislavery vigor. Having just been remotivated to write music, Work, who had witnessed the hardships of slavery firsthand, was drawn to Root &amp; Cady, conveniently situated in his hometown of Chicago. He engaged in a markedly successful partnership with the firm throughout the war and in subsequent years.

== Civil War career ==

Work&#x27;s music &quot;captured the spirit and struggle of the Civil War,&quot; composed with &quot;a fiery partisanship.&quot; From 1861 to 1865 he penned 27 patriotic pieces and published them for Root &amp; Cady. He is held as one of the Union&#x27;s preeminent bards whose songs reflect the nation&#x27;s progress and civilian struggles during the war. His musical contributions to the Union are paralleled with military efforts on the battlefield itself. An 1884 anthology of Northern compositions, &quot;Our National War Songs&quot;, lists more songs penned by Work than any other composer, illustrating their value in the struggle. Chief among them are &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; (1861), &quot;Grafted into the Army&quot; (1862), &quot;Song of a Thousand Years&quot; (1863), &quot;Babylon is Fallen&quot; (1863), &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot; (1864) and &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; (1865). They reaped nigh unrivalled success; Work&#x27;s career, as well as Root &amp; Cady&#x27;s, crested during the war.

Many of Work&#x27;s songs present slaves&#x27; routine undertakings on the plantation and incorporate African-American dialect, thus falling in the minstrelsy genre. In Florine Thayer McCray&#x27;s words, they evoke &quot;the very atmosphere of awakening plantation life&quot; and echo &quot;the cottonpicker&#x27;s musing hum and the roustabout&#x27;s refrain.&quot; However, contrary to the minstrel tradition, Work exposes the actual struggles endured by African Americans rather than stereotyping or idealizing them as most antebellum musicians such as Stephen Foster and Thomas D. Rice had done. Having come face to face with their hardships while in the Underground Railroad, Work genuinely understood the plight of slaves. He resorted to minstrelsy not merely for entertainment but to endorse emancipation and Black enlistment.

=== 1861 ===
&quot;Brave Boys Are They&quot;, a grim overview of army life, kickstarted Work&#x27;s wartime career but it was not until March that his music started leaving an impression. That month, George F. Root bought out another of his Unionist compositions, &quot;Our Captain&#x27;s Last Words&quot;, amassing considerable sales. Root met him in person a short while after as Work presented the manuscript for a new song; his autobiography gives an account of the encounter:

He saw great potential in Work&#x27;s &quot;gift for composition&quot; and, in a time that &quot;called for patriotic songs with a strong Union flavor,&quot; assigned him a songwriting post lasting until the Civil War&#x27;s end.
==== &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; and minstrelsy ====
&quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; is deemed &quot;the first of [Work&#x27;s] important songs&quot; as well as his &quot;unquestioned masterpiece,&quot; cementing itself as a wartime favorite of African-American troops. A symbol of the war&#x27;s progress, it portends the Emancipation Proclamation, the executive order effectively liberating all slaves in Confederate territory. A &quot;hypocritical and cowardly&quot; slave owner, fearing being captured by incoming Union military forces, escapes his plantation, then taken over by his slaves who lock their overseer up as retribution for his cruelty.
A staple of minstrelsy, &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; reverses the antebellum tradition of denigrating the plight of slaves, instead sympathizing with them. Ever since the 1830s lower-class Northern theater had been dominated by troupes of blackface performers. Dressed in extravagant costumes and armed with banjos, they acted as caricatured African Americans reminiscing about their days in the agrarian South. The Romantic portrayal of Southern plantation life, with slaves and their owners residing harmoniously, gave uninformed Northern audiences a false impression of African Americans&#x27; toil in an era when slavery was growing into a dangerously divisive political issue.

&quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; strays from the mockery of blackface minstrelsy, portraying a realistic picture of plantation life and humanizing slaves rather than presenting them as blithe, docile servants. Instead of the oppressive master reigning supreme over his subjects as generally observed in minstrel songs, these roles are inverted; the slaves take over the plantation and overcome their overseer. It vastly appealed to African-American Union troops who sang it regularly as they marched to the South. The song&#x27;s allure was bolstered by its employment of African-American dialect. Its &quot;robust melody,&quot; blending in perfectly with the lyrics, reflects Work&#x27;s harmonic finesse.

First advertised by Edwin P. Christy in April 1862, &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; quickly became a linchpin of minstrel show repertoires. Such was its success that Root could not keep up with orders, claiming it to be his firm&#x27;s most profitable composition &quot;for nearly a year and a half&quot; and &quot;the most successful patriotic song in the West.&quot; After the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, approximately 10,000 Chicagoans gathered at Clark Street to celebrate the occasion; &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot;, symbolizing the proclamation&#x27;s outcome, was one of the abolitionist songs chanted alongside &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot;. While time has not been kind with the song, up until the 19th century&#x27;s close, it was reportedly as popular as &quot;Dixie&quot;.

=== 1862 ===
By 1862 the surge in patriotic songs witnessed the year prior had slowed down, but Work&#x27;s output did not decline. It includes &quot;God Save the Nation&quot;, &quot;Uncle Joe&#x27;s Hail Columbia&quot; and &quot;Grafted into the Army&quot;. The lattermost, the most well-known of the bunch, is &quot;a delightful comedy tune&quot; narrated by a widowed mother whose son was drafted into the Union army under President Lincoln&#x27;s Enrollment Act. The song particularly targets a provision in the law exempting those paying a $300 fee to the government or appointing a substitute, while the poor mother&#x27;s son is obliged to fight.

=== 1863 ===

At the Civil War&#x27;s apex, with many Northerners &quot;Copperheads&quot; questioning Lincoln&#x27;s running of the conflict, Root accelerated the production of Unionist compositions to hike morale up but struggled to recruit enough composers for his firm. Still, it managed to print 250,000 copies of sheet music. That year, he began issuing a periodical, the &quot;Song Messenger&quot;, with Work as its editor. They agreed that Work would be &quot;independent and untrammeled in the expression of his views on all subjects&quot; but this promptly sparked controversy. In a June article he admonished compilers of church music books for altering traditional tunes and corrupting their sanctity, followed up by another in July denouncing one of the adapted hymns as &quot;hardly recognizable [and] mutilated.&quot; Many compilers perceived these articles as defamation and demanded an apology. While the periodical survived the dispute, Work&#x27;s editing post did not; he was laid off in August. Nonetheless, this did not tarnish his collaboration with Root, for 1863 proved another fruitful year, indicated by the tunes &quot;Sleeping for the Flag&quot;, &quot;Song of a Thousand Years&quot; and, most notably, &quot;Babylon is Fallen&quot;.

&quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; had been such a major success that numerous takes on the theme of slaves&#x27; emancipation sprung up such as Root&#x27;s &quot;De Day ob Liberty&#x27;s Comin&quot; (1862). Work published a sequel of his hit in July 1863 titled &quot;Babylon is Fallen&quot;, alluding to Revelation 14, NT: &quot;Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,&quot; which symbolizes the downfall of despotism. This suits the song&#x27;s content, narrating the slaves&#x27; seizure of their master who had fled to fight for the Confederate army and returned disgraced. Also written in vernacular, &quot;Babylon is Fallen&quot; aroused African Americans recruited for the Union army; their numbers had grown since the Emancipation Proclamation&#x27;s passage. Also a favorite among abolitionists and soldiers, it sold more first-month copies than its prequel.

=== 1864 ===
1863 had been exceedingly fruitful for Root &amp; Cady and other Chicagoan music firms, thriving in &quot;a flourishing condition&quot; according to the &quot;Song Messenger.&quot; Their songs were played routinely at minstrel shows and local musical gatherings. By 1864 Root was held as &quot;the most popular songwriter in America,&quot; in no doubt helped by Work&#x27;s success. That year, he published the patriotic songs &quot;Wake Nicodemus&quot;, a minstrel show hit, &quot;Washington and Lincoln&quot; and &quot;Corporal Schnapps&quot;. The last of these is a tragic yet humorous lament distinguished for its employment of German dialect, said to enable &quot;the difficult fear of laughing and crying at the same time&quot;:

==== &quot;Come Home, Father&quot; and temperance ====

Besides the Union struggle, Work devoted himself to the temperance movement, &quot;[expressing] his passionate convictions about Prohibition&quot; through music. The movement gained much traction after the Civil War&#x27;s close as many moralistic fraternities, eminently, the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, called for public education on the perils of alcohol. Drunkards were framed as sinful and culpable for the degeneration of lives throughout the country. &quot;Reform literature&quot; was the popular medium through which temperance was propagated, often taking the form of simple, sentimental and persuasive lyrics. Biographer George W. Ewing notes: &quot;Many, if not most, of the hymnbooks of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries contain at least two or three temperance hymns.&quot; It borrowed elements from contemporary literary realism, documenting the hardships of domestic life with emphasis on women&#x27;s oppression at the hands of their husband&#x27;s indulgent habits.

In line with the ever-growing movement, Work composed several influential songs spotlighting the perils of alcohol consumption. His most renowned is &quot;Come Home, Father&quot;, a young girl&#x27;s plea for her father, then trifling away his pay and time in a bar getting drunk, to return home while her brother is slowly dying. Like many other temperance lyrics, it is overtly sentimental to persuade the audience of the vices of alcoholism but also realistic in tackling a pressing social issue. Such was its puissance that Work received hundreds of appreciative letters from social reformers. One Louisianan woman even wrote to him requesting a song targeted at inducing her husband to quit his extramarital affair and figuratively &quot;return home.&quot;

In an 1898 &quot;New Haven Journal-Courier&quot; editorial, Florine Thayer McCray writes: &quot;[...] who has not sat breathless listening to the rare combination of pathos and harmony with which the changing cadences of human voices plead &#x27;Hear the Sweet Voice of the Child&#x27; [the chorus] and felt how much more persuasive and fetching than any temperance sermon was this song [...]&quot; A hallmark of temperance meetings, &quot;Come Home, Father&quot; was adopted as the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union&#x27;s theme tune. The song featured as an interlude in a production of Timothy Shay Arthur&#x27;s acclaimed Prohibitionist play &quot;Ten Nights in a Barroom&quot;.

Work wrote other temperance songs after the war, including &quot;Lillie of the Snowstorm&quot; (1866), &quot;King Bibler&#x27;s Army&quot; (1877), which was moderately successful, and &quot;Shadows on the Floor&quot; (1877), an account of impoverished families&#x27; hardships, although none faithfully captured the essence and fame of &quot;Come Home, Father&quot;.

=== 1865 ===
Root &amp; Cady&#x27;s early weeks of 1865 were occupied with Root&#x27;s latest 1864 hit, &quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!&quot;, stimulated by grim revelations on the atrocities within Confederate prison camps. It took the Union by storm and earned the firm over $10,000 in profit within a few months. In February Work set P. G. T. Beauregard&#x27;s recent evacuation of Charleston to music; the product, &quot;Ring the Bell, Watchman&quot;, reflected the successive toppling of Confederate cities during the war&#x27;s final weeks. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9 marked the Civil War&#x27;s end; Chicagoans paraded the streets and packed the local Court House until well into the night. Work celebrated the triumph with a final wartime composition, &quot;&#x27;Tis Finished!, or Sing Hallelujah&quot;, published in June. However, for him, 1865 remains best remembered for the meteoric popularity of &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;.

==== &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; ====
Of all Work&#x27;s Civil War compositions, none were as acclaimed as &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;, widely regarded as &quot;the greatest of his war songs.&quot; The end of 1864 saw the March to the Sea, in which Union forces crippled Confederate resources in Georgia and took over Savannah. Work capitalized on this to write another of his topical celebratory songs, &quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot;. Its &quot;suggestive verse&quot; and &quot;swinging meter&quot; capture the actual enthusiasm felt by Union troops during the campaign. Published in January 1865, it was a runaway success, selling 500,000 copies in its first twelve years. In his autobiography published 26 years after the song&#x27;s drafting, Root explained its popularity:

&quot;Marching Through Georgia&quot; quickly became a staple of Civil War reunions; Work even sang it at one of the Grand Army of the Republic&#x27;s annual campfires—something he typically resisted. Its ubiquity famously inflamed General William T. Sherman, whom it is dedicated to. He grew to despise it after repeatedly hearing it in every public gathering he attended; he once remarked of a reunion: &quot;Scarcely had I gotten under way, however, when the strains of that infernal tune smote upon my ear.&quot;

== Later career and life ==

=== Postbellum ===
With the Civil War over, Work&#x27;s motivation for songwriting and musical output declined considerably. Turning away from patriotic songs now deemed outdated, he settled into sentimental balladry. His postbellum songs focus on somber themes owing to the personal tragedies engulfing his later life, as writer Dean Nelson notes in a 2008 &quot;Connecticut&quot; &quot;Explored&quot; article: &quot;[...] in his lyrics, children die, soldiers die, ships sink, love goes unreturned, poor folks starve, and the lonely remain so.&quot; Newly enriched by his war efforts, Work embarked on a tour around Europe from 1865 to 1866, during which he wrote the first of his few notable postbellum songs, &quot;The Ship That Never Returned&quot;. It narrates the departure of a ship from a harbor that never come back, with a mother and the captain&#x27;s wife lamenting the loss of their loved ones on board.
It swiftly entered the folk tradition and sparked the creation of numerous melodic imitations, especially on railway incidents, the most famous of which is the tragic ballad &quot;The Wreck of the Old 97&quot; (1903). In 1866 Work composed another song concerning a maritime disaster, &quot;When the &#x27;Evening Star&#x27; Went Down&quot;, commemorating the eponymous steamer&#x27;s sinking after sailing into a hurricane.

Upon returning to the United States, Work and his brother invested most of their wealth in hundreds of acres of land in Vineland, New Jersey hoping to establishing a profitable fruit farm. Their expectations were promptly wiped out as the farm failed, bankrupting them both. This was the first of several personal tragedies to befall him. &quot;[F]orced to begin life over again,&quot; Work left Vineland and disappeared from public life. In 1868 he moved to Philadelphia, living in seclusion since his wife had become insane for reasons unspecified; still, the family seemed to condemn him. He was cut off from his children who were residing with Sarah in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Two years later, meanwhile having passed some time in California, he resettled in Brooklyn, spending the next twelve years isolated in a boarding house. A letter composed in the early 1870s to his correspondent Susie Mitchell paints a grim picture of the depression consuming his postbellum life, worsened by the loss of his son Waldo in 1871:

In the postwar years leading up to 1872, Work penned 17 songs, fewer than the 27 authored during the Civil War; the only profitable one was &quot;The Ship That Never Returned&quot;. Others include &quot;Andy Veto&quot; (1866), a satire of then-President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s vetoing of Reconstruction legislation, and &quot;Crossing the Grand Sierras&quot; (1870), describing a train voyage across the nation set just after the Transcontinental Railroad&#x27;s completion. The latter was Work&#x27;s last song published for Root &amp; Cady—personal differences between him and Root as well as the business&#x27; abrupt closure brought their once fertile collaboration to an end.

=== Decline ===

==== Root &amp; Cady&#x27;s closure ====

Contrary to Work&#x27;s misfortune, the postbellum years were looking bright for Root &amp; Cady. Publications and song anthologies, among them, the temperance song compilation titled &quot;The Musical Fountain&quot;, were being churned out at a rate surpassing even their wartime production. The Chicagoan music scene was as lively as ever. George F. Root also distinguished himself as a prominent campaigner for Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 presidential election. However, their prospects came crashing down in the fall of 1871 when the firm burnt down in the Great Chicago Fire, incurring $315,000 in losses. It raged on from October 8 to October 10, destroying all waterworks, banking houses and railway depots, and caused a minor depression in the national stock market. Every business in the city&#x27;s south wing was obliterated; it was reported that over 20,000 buildings were demolished, wreaking over $200,000,000 in damages. All of Work&#x27;s original music plates fell victim to the conflagration.

Root remarked in the &quot;Song Messenger&quot;: &quot;All is gone, my musical library and the thousand useful things that I have gathered about me in so many busy years, swept in a moment.&quot; Unable to continue the business in its former rendition, Root &amp; Cady&#x27;s music copyrights were all sold to Ohioan publishers S. Brainard Sons and John Church &amp; Co. The firm filed for bankruptcy in 1872. Root continued his former teaching profession and Cady left Chicago for New York. This dispirited a potential reinvigoration of Work&#x27;s songwriting career; from 1872 to 1876 he published no music.

==== Working for Cady ====
After Root &amp; Cady shut down, Root pursued some more ventures in music firms, culminating in the Root &amp; Sons Music Company which bore some success until dissolving in 1880. His business partner Chauncey M. Cady also sought to reinitiate a profitable career as a music publisher. He established a business at 107 Duane Street, New York City, in 1875, lasting five years until shutting it down owing to fatigue from old age. In 1876 Cady chanced to encounter Work while strolling in Broadway and, sensing a lucrative opportunity, offered him a post at his business. Eager to pick up songwriting once again, Work accepted; he published nine songs for Cady from 1876 to 1879, ending his four-year &quot;retirement.&quot; Throughout this time, he also wrote for John Church &amp; Co., William A. Pond &amp; Co. and Root&#x27;s firm.

==== &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot; ====
Work&#x27;s most profitable hit, also his last, was &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot;, issued by Cady in January 1876 and popularized by African-American entertainer Sam Lucas in New Haven. Inspired by his sympathetic attitude toward disaffected individuals, he anthropomorphizes a clock to signify its owner; it had stood for ninety years throughout the old man&#x27;s life and accompanied him. When he dies, the clock also stops functioning, a symbol of human mortality and irreplaceable companionship. The song remains most memorable for its onomatopoeic &quot;ticking&quot; chorus and effortlessly inventive rhymes: &quot;Ninety years without slumbering [...] / His life seconds numbering.&quot;

Although Work awaited nothing beyond a moderate hit, Cady expected a widespread success. His prophecy was proven correct: the song secured over 800,000 sheet music sales. It also coined the phrase &quot;grandfather clock&quot; to describe a longcase clock. After Work sold the copyright to &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot;, Cady paid him a royalty of $4,000, helping to lift him out of poverty. In total, this was the highest bestowed to any American composer at the time, only possibly surpassed by Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. An 1879 issue of the &quot;San Marcos Free Press&quot; highlights its ubiquity, claiming that not knowing the song &quot;argues yourself unknown,&quot; being &quot;nightly played in theater and concert halls to applauding auditors.&quot; American music historian John T. Howard claims that &quot;there is scarcely a school songbook&quot; excluding &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot;.In 1878 Work composed a follow-up simply titled &quot;Sequel to Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot;, continuing the song&#x27;s narrative after the grandfather&#x27;s death. A relative of his returns to the old man&#x27;s home to encounter his beloved clock being burnt for kindling wood; in its place now stands an unsightly wall ornament.

=== End ===
None of Work&#x27;s compositions post-&quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Clock&quot; reproduced the same success. His life became mangled by boredom and depression; in an 1875 letter, he wrote: &quot;I am no longer a printer—am now a proof-reader. Nothing to do all day, but to read and criticize, find fault or mark errors [...]&quot; Only printing, the career he held since his youth, and attendance at local church services absorbed him. An unhappy marriage and family life drove him further into despair as the &quot;last years of his life were clouded with the illness of his wife&quot; who was in a mental asylum. He tried his hand at a long-distance relationship with Pennsylvanian Susie Mitchell but eventually called it off after a decade of corresponding with her.

Work&#x27;s passion for songwriting also took another hit; following its revival in early 1876, he would only issue two compositions before another hiatus in 1879. Some noteworthy ones of this period are the &quot;California Bird Song&quot; (1878), included in popular singer Emma C. Thursby&#x27;s repertoire, and &quot;Mac O&#x27; Macorkity&quot; (1877). The latter reflects Work&#x27;s fascination with dialect and the comic genre, narrating the misadventures of a prototypical Irish family at dinner.In 1882 Work left Brooklyn for the more serene Bath in upstate New York, longing for an abode where he &quot;could find a still nook in this still noisy world [...] engage in literary and musical work, and at the same time find repose for over-strung nerves.&quot; That year, he briefly picked up composition again, penning roughly ten songs until 1883, including &quot;The Lost Letter&quot; and &quot;The Prayer on the Pier&quot;, but at this point he could only &quot;[clutch] for straws of his former fame.&quot;

He died abruptly of heart disease on June 8, 1884, while visiting his mother&#x27;s residence at Chestnut Street, Hartford. He was survived by one of his four children, Nellie. Obituaries &quot;brushed off&quot; his legacy, often spanning a few lines and merely recognizing him as a &quot;noted song writer and composer,&quot; citing a few famous songs and nothing more. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery, Hartford. It was only until 25 years later that a monument in his honor was be erected, in the same cemetery.

== Personal life ==

=== Character ===

One of Work&#x27;s obituaries summarized his persona as an &quot;invalid-like fellow with sadness in his voice and bearing poverty in his dress.&quot; Reportedly &quot;a man of fine appearance,&quot; he stood at about five feet ten inches, having brown hair, full whiskers and bluish-grey eyes. He was &quot;very reserved and unassuming,&quot; going as far as to refuse exposing plagiarism to his music. He made few intimate friends. Despite much of his life being beclouded by tragedy, Work had a sense of humor, exhibited on one occasion when someone sang &quot;Come Home, Father&quot; claiming he had written it; Work stood through the performance without once speaking up. Practicing what his temperance songs preached, he was a committed teetotaler and Prohibitionist activist, even advocating the outlawing of tobacco. Florine Thayer McCray writes: &quot;He was of the people, in sympathy with them, and thought not of the small fame which comes from the critical sanction of a few self-instituted judges of literary and musical form.&quot;

A Christian disciple and regular church-goer, while residing in Brooklyn, Work frequented services at Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s Plymouth Church; in 1871 he wrote: &quot;One radical struck deep into the ground where Plymouth Church stands, and for months that was all that held me.&quot; In fact, that year, he composed a brief oratorio dedicated to his congregation, &quot;Joy in Heaven!, or The Returning Wandering&#x27;s Welcome&quot;.

=== Family and relationship ===
In 1857 Work married Massachusettsan Sarah Parker. He had four children with her: Waldo Franklin (1857–1871), Willie Lovejoy (1861–1862), Ellen Louisa (1863–1895) and Clara Etta (1878). The Works spent a few years in Chicago and Hubbardston, Massachusetts before migrating permanently to Greenwich Village, Manhattan sometime before 1865. After his wife spiraled into degeneracy, Work lived disconnected from his family. They chided him, without sound grounds, for Sarah&#x27;s mental instability as well as Waldo&#x27;s abrupt death. The only saving grace of such a tumultuous family life was his daughter Nellie, his only child to outlive him, whom he was exceedingly fond of and depended on for solace in his final years. Having to endure a distressing marriage, and ruling out divorce as an option, Work hungered for a romantic relationship: the subject of two extensive studies by Richard S. Hill named &quot;The Mysterious Chord of Henry Clay Work&quot;.

In 1868, while searching for a home in Philadelphia, he came across one owned by the Mitchell family in the Ledger Residences. While greeting the family, he became enchanted by the 18-year-old Susie and soon fell in love with her. Assuming she reciprocated his affection but also desperate for a gratifying relationship, Work established a correspondence with her, writing 40 lengthy letters from 1869 to 1883 &quot;in a small almost perfect penmanship&quot; which &quot;concealed his feelings in the formal style of the day.&quot; The vast majority were written in his early New York years, from 1870 to 1874. While Susie invited him over several times during this period such as for Christmas, she did not share his enthusiasm. In 1871 Work even dedicated a song to her, &quot;No Letters From Home&quot;, a plea for more letters from the Mitchell family to remedy the loneliness eclipsing him.

Being nearly double her age, he knew this relationship stood no chance at being fulfilled; in fact, she would get married in 1877. Upon hearing of Susie&#x27;s intentions to wed, Work thought it best to close off the correspondence and thereafter only wrote terse, stilted notes on occasion. One of his final &quot;long&quot; letters, the only one in which he does not restrain his true emotions, states:

Work later wrote a composition titled &quot;Farewell, My Loved One!&quot;; its closing verses reflect the misery and hopelessness consuming him:

=== Chicago ===

Work migrated to Chicago in 1855 to further his trade as a printer. In 1859, after Paul Cornell established a new community in the city&#x27;s south wing, Hyde Park, Work purchased a plot of land from him for $175. Roughly a year later, he oversaw the construction of his residence at 5317 Dorchester Avenue, a small, humble cottage &quot;hardly [looking] big enough to house a piano.&quot; He and his wife, Sarah, devoted themselves to the Chicagoan community, being among the first organizers of the First Presbyterian Church. Work even served as township clerk from 1864 to 1866. In 1867 he sold the cottage and land and took up a new residence in Philadelphia, later moving to New York City.

=== Pastimes ===
Work indulged himself in mechanical studies and experiments, and during pauses in his musical career, he was devoted &quot;almost exclusively&quot; to them. He invented and patented a knitting machine, a walking doll and a rotary engine. In 1868 he wrote a once popular seriocomic poem, &quot;The Upshot Family&quot;, satirizing a prototypical American family; its title page catalogs most of the songs he had written by then, totaling 43.

=== Songwriting style ===
George F. Root said of Work&#x27;s style of composition: &quot;Mr. Work was a slow, painstaking writer, being from one to three weeks upon a song; but when the work was done it was like a piece of fine mosaic, especially in the fitting of words to music.&quot; He stressed Work&#x27;s natural poetic talent and mastery of melody. Another writer remarked:

His unique method of composition involved devising the melody and lyrics simultaneously in his head and, after much deliberation, putting them to paper. Sometimes, he would deliberate for a short while—at other times, he would anxiously pass days on end failing to concoct a suitable idea. The finished manuscript would then be published without him once previously hearing what he had composed. In his youth, he habitually jotted down lyrics on small cards while going about his routine and then adapted them to sweet piano melodies. Fixated on originality, Work crafted the tune for all his compositions and wrote the lyrics of all but four, actively refusing requests to put others&#x27; words to music. He went as far as to design the title pages of his songs. While a talented songwriter, he did not delight in singing, declaring: &quot;The man who writes songs doesn&#x27;t generally feel like singing them.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Work is held as the most celebrated American popular music songwriter of the Civil War and Reconstruction era. A committed believer in moral societal causes, his music brought them closer to the people and &quot;touched the popular heart.&quot; In fact, many of his songs were part and parcel of contemporary antislavery and Prohibitionist gatherings. Such was his influence in promoting teetotalism that in the reformist song compilation &quot;The Musical Fountain&quot;, George F. Root declares him &quot;the pioneer of the grand temperance awakening.&quot; However, Work&#x27;s legacy ultimately lies in the slew of patriotic compositions hallowing the Unionist struggle in the Civil War. A Hartford monument dedicated to the composer by then-Connecticut governor Frank B. Weeks epitomizes his music&#x27;s indispensability:

He was additionally one of the developers of the refined verse-chorus structure of late-19th-century popular music. In 1970 Work was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

<text>The Executive Council of Catalonia () or the Executive Government of Catalonia (Catalan: ) is the executive branch of the Generalitat of Catalonia and its main collective decision-making body. It is responsible for the political action, regulation, and administration of the government of the autonomous region.

The President of the Generalitat is the head of government. The president may also appoint a First Minister (Catalan: &quot;Conseller(a) primer(a)&quot;) to serve as their deputy, although since 2006 the office has been replaced by that of the Vice-President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, who must be approved by the Parliament of Catalonia. The various ministers (Catalan: &quot;consellers&quot;) are also appointed by the President of the Generalitat. Ministers, who chair their respective departments, need not be deputies in the parliament, as they have an automatic right to intervene in parliamentary 
debates. 

The Executive Council is made up by the President, the First Minister or Vice president, and the Ministers. Sessions of the council are called by the President, who chairs it, or, if absent, by the First Minister or Vice president. The mandatory quorum is half the Ministers and the chair. Decisions and resolutions are adopted by simple majority, and in case of tie, the vote cast by the President is tie-breaking. All decisions must be recorded in minutes drawn up by the Secretary of the Government. Members are required to keep secret the deliberations taken and members&#x27; individual opinions and votes. Members may not release documents known by the Council until their official publication.

Serving members of the government may not be arrested for any acts committed in Catalonia, except &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot;, and may only be judged before the High Court of Justice of Catalonia, or the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court of Spain outside of Catalonia.

The Parliament of Catalonia unilaterally issued a declaration of independence from Spain on 27 October 2017 in favour of a Catalan Republic. In response Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Parliament of Catalonia and called a snap regional election for 21 December 2017.

<doc id="944096" wikidata="Q207964" url="?curid=944096" title="Digital Fortress">
<text>Digital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications of using such technology.

==Plot summary==
The story is set in 1996. When the United States National Security Agency&#x27;s (NSA) code-breaking supercomputer TRANSLTR encounters a revolutionary new code, &quot;Digital Fortress,&quot; that it cannot break, Commander Trevor Strathmore calls in head cryptographer Susan Fletcher to crack it. She is informed by Strathmore that it was written by Ensei Tankado, a former NSA employee who became displeased with the NSA&#x27;s intrusion into people&#x27;s private lives. If the NSA doesn&#x27;t reveal TRANSLTR to the public, Tankado intends to auction the code&#x27;s algorithm on his website and have his partner, &quot;North Dakota&quot;, release it for free if he dies, essentially holding the NSA hostage. Strathmore tells Fletcher that Tankado has in fact died in Seville at the age of 32, of what appears to be a heart attack. Strathmore intends to keep Tankado&#x27;s death a secret because if Tankado&#x27;s partner finds out, he will upload the code. The agency is determined to stop Digital Fortress from becoming a threat to national security.

Strathmore asks Fletcher&#x27;s fiancé David Becker to travel to Seville and recover a ring that Tankado was wearing when he died. The ring is suspected to have the passcode that unlocks Digital Fortress. However, Becker soon discovers that Tankado gave the ring away just before his death. Unbeknown to Becker, a mysterious figure, named Hulohot, follows him, and murders each person he questions in the search for the ring. Unsurprisingly, Hulohot&#x27;s final attempt would be on Becker himself.

Meanwhile, telephone calls between North Dakota and Tokugen Numataka reveal that North Dakota hired Hulohot to kill Tankado in order to gain access to the passcode on his ring and speed up the release of the algorithm. 

At the NSA, Fletcher&#x27;s investigation leads her to believe that Greg Hale, a fellow NSA employee, is North Dakota. Phil Chartrukian, an NSA technician who is unaware of the Digital Fortress code breaking failure and believes Digital Fortress to be a virus, conducts his own investigation into whether Strathmore allowed Digital Fortress to bypass Gauntlet, the NSA&#x27;s virus/worm filter. To save the TRANSLTR Phil decides to shut it down but is murdered after being pushed off sub-levels of TRANSLTR by an unknown assailant. Since Hale and Strathmore were both in the sub-levels, Fletcher assumes that Hale is the killer; however, Hale claims that he witnessed Strathmore killing Chartrukian. Chartrukian&#x27;s fall also damages TRANSLTR&#x27;s cooling system.

Hale holds Fletcher and Strathmore hostage to prevent himself from being arrested for Phil&#x27;s murder. It is then that Hale explains to Fletcher, the e-mail he supposedly received from Tankado was also in Strathmore&#x27;s inbox, as Strathmore was snooping on Tankado. Fletcher discovers through a tracer that North Dakota and Ensei Tankado are the same person, as &quot;NDAKOTA&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Tankado.&quot; 

Strathmore kills Hale and arranges it to appear as a suicide. Fletcher later discovers through Strathmore&#x27;s pager that he is the one who hired Hulohot. Becker manages to track down the ring, but ends up pursued by Hulohot in a long cat-and-mouse chase across Seville. The two eventually face off in a cathedral, where Becker finally kills Hulohot by tripping him down a spiral staircase, causing him to break his neck. He is then intercepted by NSA field agents sent by Leland Fontaine, the director of the NSA.

Chapters told from Strathmore&#x27;s perspective reveal his master plan. By hiring Hulohot to kill Tankado, having Becker recover his ring and at the same time arranging for Hulohot to kill Becker, he would facilitate a romantic relationship with Fletcher, regaining his lost honor. He has also been working incessantly for many months to unlock Digital Fortress, installing a backdoor inside the program. By making phone calls to Numataka posing as North Dakota, he thought he could partner with Numatech to make a Digital Fortress chip equipped with his own backdoor Trojan. Finally, he would reveal to the world the existence of TRANSLTR, boasting it would be able to crack all the codes except Digital Fortress, making everyone rush to use the computer chip equipped with Digital Fortress so that the NSA could spy on every computer equipped with these chips. 

However, Strathmore was unaware that Digital Fortress is actually a computer worm that, once unlocked would &quot;eat away&quot; all the NSA databank&#x27;s security and allow &quot;any third-grader with a modem&quot; to look at government secrets. When TRANSLTR overheats, Strathmore dies by standing next to the machine as it explodes. The worm eventually gets into the database, but Becker figures out the passcode just seconds before the last defenses fall (3, which is the difference between the Hiroshima nuclear bomb, Isotope 235, and the Nagasaki nuclear bomb, isotope 238, a reference to the nuclear bombs that killed Tankado&#x27;s mother and left him crippled), and Fletcher is able to terminate the worm before hackers can get any significant data. The NSA allows Becker to return to the United States, reuniting him with Fletcher.

In the epilogue, it is revealed that Numataka was Ensei Tankado&#x27;s father who left Tankado the day he was born due to Tankado&#x27;s deformity. As Tankado&#x27;s last living relative, Numataka inherits the rest of Tankado&#x27;s possessions.

==Characters==

*Ensei Tankado – The author of &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; and a disgruntled former NSA employee.
*Commander Trevor Strathmore – NSA Deputy Director of Operations, second commander in chief
*Phil Chartrukian – NSA Technician
*Greg Hale – NSA Cryptographer
*Leland Fontaine – Director of NSA
*Hulohot – an assassin hired by Strathmore to locate the Passkey
*Midge Milken – Fontaine&#x27;s internal security analyst
*Chad Brinkerhoff – Fontaine&#x27;s personal assistant
*&quot;Jabba&quot; – NSA&#x27;s senior System Security Officer
*Soshi Kuta – Jabba&#x27;s head technician and assistant
*Tokugen Numataka – Chairman of Japanese company Numatech attempting to purchase &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;. It is revealed in the Epilogue that Numataka is Tankado&#x27;s father

==Inaccuracies and criticism==
The book was criticized by &quot;GCN&quot; for portraying facts about the NSA incorrectly and for misunderstanding the technology in the book, especially for the time when it was published.

In 2005, the town hall of the Spanish city of Seville invited Dan Brown to visit the city, in order to dispel the inaccuracies about Seville that Brown represented within the book.

Although uranium-235 was used in the bomb on Hiroshima, the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki used plutonium-239 (created from U-238). Uranium-238 is non-fissile.

Julius Caesar&#x27;s cypher was not as simple as the one described in the novel, based on square numbers. In &quot;The Code Book&quot; by Simon Singh it is described as a transposition cypher which was undecipherable until centuries later.

The story behind the meaning of &quot;sincere&quot; is based on false etymology.

It is also untrue that in Spain (or in any other Catholic country) that the Holy Communion takes place at the beginning of Mass; Communion takes place very near the end.

In 2020, the book was featured on the podcast &quot;372 Pages We&#x27;ll Never Get Back&quot;, which critiques literature deemed low-quality.

<text>In chemistry, a topotactic transition involves a structural change to a crystalline solid, which may include loss or gain of material, so that the final lattice is related to that of the original material by one or more crystallographically equivalent, orientational relationships.

An example is a transition in which the relative structure of the anionic array is unaltered but the cations reorganize as in:

β- ⇒ γ-

An alternate example is the oxidation of magnetite to maghemite.

<text>Outright Scotland is an LGBT rights organisation based in Edinburgh, Scotland. Founded as the Scottish Minorities Group in 1969, it was the country&#x27;s first LGBT rights organisation.

==History==
The Scottish Minorities Group (SMG) was a Scottish gay rights group officially founded in Glasgow on 9 May 1969. The group was a self-help organisation working for the rights of homosexual men and women, and had the aims of providing counselling, working for law reform and providing meeting places for lesbians and gay men.

The group&#x27;s first meeting in January 1969 was organised by Ian Dunn at his parents&#x27; home in Glasgow. On 9 May 1969, the group was officially launched at an open meeting in the Protestant Chaplaincy Centre of Glasgow University that was attended by about 25 men and women. SMG meetings moved to the basement of the Catholic Chaplaincy in Edinburgh with the support of its chaplain Father Anthony Ross in August 1969.

A monthly newsletter, &quot;SMG News&quot;, was started in January 1971. In the same year the group organised the Cobweb disco, which was Scotland&#x27;s first gay disco. The DJ was Willie Peacock, it was held every Saturday, and it grew to draw visitors from all over Scotland and became &quot;the&quot; place to go after the Kenilworth on a Saturday night. The SMG Glasgow Women&#x27;s Group was launched along with its magazine &quot;Gayzette&quot;.

In 1972, SMG started the Edinburgh Gay Switchboard. SMG organised the International Gay Rights Congress held in the Student&#x27;s Union of Edinburgh University from 18–22 December 1974. It concluded with a disco which ended with John and Yoko Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Happy Christmas War Is over&quot;, by this time there was a positive feeling that the fight for gay equality was almost over too. Around 400 people attended the event and it led to the setting up of the International Gay Association in 1978. At the end of 1974 premises at Broughton Street, Edinburgh were purchased and the SMG Information Centre opened there in the Spring of 1975. The &quot;Cobweb&quot; had lost its premises because of the move and in its place SMG moved to a monthly one-nighter fund raising disco on the third Tuesday of the month at Cinderella Rockerfella&#x27;s in the city&#x27;s St. Stephen Street.

In October 1974 the Paedophile Information Exchange, a pro-paedophile activist group was founded as a special interest group within the Scottish Minorities Group. SMG founder Ian Dunn was among the founding members of PIE.

By 1977 the premises hosted a coffeeshop, a bookstall, a &quot;befriending service&quot; (non-directive counselling by telephone and face to face and modelled loosely on the approach taken by the Samaritans) and offered a friendly, sociable and informative environment to homosexuals of both sexes. The property had a large window onto a busy main street and openly proclaimed its purpose. Today this is the Edinburgh LGBT Centre. In the late 1970s a gay youth group met weekly in the basement of the University Catholic Chaplaincy although this was short-lived in the legally ambiguous climate that then prevailed in Scotland.

In 1977, the Glasgow Gay Centre was opened in Sauchiehall Street. In November 1978, &quot;SMG News&quot; was renamed (with “no trumpets”) &quot;Gay Scotland&quot; while SMG changed its name to the Scottish Homosexual Rights Group (SHRG). 

In 1980, Robin Cook&#x27;s amendment to the 1980 Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill partially decriminalised gay sex between men over 21. This allowed a commercial scene to develop and Bennets Nightclub opened in Glasgow in 1981. There was subsequently less demand for community facilities. At its peak in 1982, SHRG had 1200 members. However, the Glasgow Gay Centre closed in 1982.

In 1988 the SHRG organised its first &quot;Lark in the Park&quot; in Edinburgh’s Princes Street gardens, the event was the precursor to Pride Scotia, which began in 1995.

In 1992, SHRG changed its name to Outright Scotland.

==Today==
Latterly focusing on work around the Scottish Parliament, Scottish Executive and Scottish Public Institutions such as the National Health Service, Police and Justice System, Outright Scotland is currently dormant with much of their former role being taken by the Equality Network and Stonewall Scotland.

<doc id="944127" wikidata="Q2214688" url="?curid=944127" title="Sally (musical)">
<text>Sally is a musical comedy with music by Jerome Kern, lyrics by Clifford Grey and book by Guy Bolton (inspired by the 19th century show, &quot;Sally in our Alley&quot;), with additional lyrics by Buddy De Sylva, Anne Caldwell and P. G. Wodehouse. The plot hinges on a mistaken identity: Sally, a waif, is a dishwasher at the Alley Inn in New York City. She poses as a famous foreign ballerina and rises to fame (and finds love) through joining the Ziegfeld Follies. There is a rags to riches story, a ballet as a centrepiece, and a wedding as a finale. &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot; continues to be one of Kern&#x27;s most familiar songs. The song is lampooned by another song, &quot;Look for a Sky of Blue,&quot; in Rick Besoyan&#x27;s satirical 1959 musical &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;.

The piece was first produced in 1920 on Broadway by Florenz Ziegfeld, and ran for 570 performances, one of the longest runs on Broadway up to that time. The show was designed as a debut star vehicle for Marilyn Miller. It had a successful London run and was revived several times on Broadway and in the West End, although it has had few productions since the 1950s. The musical was adapted into a 1925 silent film and a 1929 musical film.

==Background and original production==
Kern, Bolton, and Wodehouse had collaborated on a number of musical comedies at the Princess Theatre. The story combined the innocence of these earlier &quot;Princess musicals&quot; with the lavishness of the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; formula. The score recycles some material from previous Kern shows, including &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot; and &quot;Whip-poor-will&quot; (with lyrics by De Sylva, from the flop &quot;Zip Goes a Million&quot;); &quot;The Lorelei&quot; (lyrics by Anne Caldwell); and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Keep a Good Girl Down&quot; and &quot;The Church &#x27;Round the Corner&quot; (lyrics by Wodehouse). Grey supplied the lyrics for the few new songs in the score. At the request of Ziegfeld, Victor Herbert was engaged to write the music to &quot;The Butterfly Ballet&quot; in Act Three.

The musical was originally produced by Florenz Ziegfeld, opening on December 21, 1920 at the New Amsterdam Theatre on Broadway. It ran for 570 performances, which was one of the longest runs on Broadway up to that time. By the time it closed in 1924 (including revivals), it would prove to be among the top five money makers of the 1920s. The show was designed as the musical comedy debut of Marilyn Miller, a 22-year-old &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; girl. Miller would continue to be a star on Broadway until her death in 1936.

==Subsequent productions==
The musical enjoyed a successful production in 1921 in London at the Winter Garden Theatre, starring British musical comedy veterans George Grossmith Jr. and Leslie Henson, which ran for 387 performances.

It also played well in 1923 in Australia, produced by the J. C. Williamson company. There were Broadway revivals in 1923 (at the New Amsterdam Theatre) and 1948 and London revivals in 1942 (at Prince&#x27;s Theatre) and 1952 (Oxford New Theatre). Other productions included a 1944 LACLO Production in Los Angeles, California and a 1988 concert production Off-Broadway at the Academy Theatre.

==Adaptations==

A 1925 silent romantic comedy film of the same name starred Colleen Moore and was directed by Alfred E. Green, produced by Moore&#x27;s husband John McCormick. The screenplay was adapted by June Mathis.

The 1929 musical film version was only the third all talking all-color feature movie ever made. It retains three of Kern&#x27;s songs (&quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot;, &quot;Sally&quot;, and &quot;Wild Rose&quot;). The rest of the music newly written for the film by Al Dubin and Joe Burke. Miller was hired by the Warner Brothers to reprise her role at an extravagant sum (reportedly $1,000 an hour for a total of $100,000). The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction by Jack Okey in 1930.

&quot;Sally&quot; was presented on &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot; April 6, 1953. The 30-minute radio adaptation starred Gordon MacRae and Lucille Norman.
