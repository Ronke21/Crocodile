<text>The Russian men&#x27;s national ice hockey team () is the national men&#x27;s ice hockey team of Russia, overseen by the Ice Hockey Federation of Russia. As of 2021, they were rated third in the IIHF World Ranking. The team has competed internationally from 1992 until it was provisionally suspended in 2022, and is recognized by the IIHF as the successor to the Soviet Union team and CIS team. Russia has been one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six,&quot; the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Sweden, and the United States. The European nations of the Big Six participate in the Euro Hockey Tour, which Russia won nine times since 2005. Since September 2021, the head coach is Alexei Zhamnov, who took over from Valeri Bragin.

Since the establishment of the team, Russia has participated in 29 IIHF World Championships tournaments and nine Olympic ice hockey tournaments, winning five world championships and one Olympic gold medal.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Ice Hockey Federation suspended Russia from all levels of competition on 28 February 2022. In April 2022, the Federation banned Russia from participating in the 2023 IIHF World Championship.

==History==
===Origins===

The Allrussian Hockey League was founded by some clubs in the Russian Empire and entered the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) in 1911. However, probably due to misunderstandings (&quot;hockey&quot; was identified with bandy or Russian hockey in Russia, not with the modern ice hockey rules developed in Canada) the Russian team left the organization. There were no matches involving a team from Imperial Russia.

Interest in this sport grew in the Soviet Union in the second half of the 1940s. The first reactions were skeptical; one sports journal, &quot;Physical Culture and Sports&quot;, characterized it as such: &quot;The game is quite individual and primitive, with few combinations, not as in bandy. Therefore, Canadian hockey should not be cultivated into our country...&quot; However, Canadian hockey became more and more popular in the Soviet Union.

The first Soviet Championships League was introduced in 1946. The national team was formed shortly after, playing their first matches in a series of exhibitions against LTC Praha in 1948. In 1952, the Hockey Federation of the USSR joined the International Ice Hockey League, and so received the permission to play in the World Championships and the Olympics. That year is seen as the birth of the Soviet national ice hockey team, the predecessor team of the Russia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. The Soviets won the 1954 Ice Hockey World Championships, and two years later they won gold at the 1956 Winter Olympics.

From then until the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, the &quot;Red Machine&quot; (; &quot;Krasnaya Mashina&quot;) was one of the most dominant teams in international play, winning nearly every World Championship and Olympic tournament, as well as defeating many teams with professional players, such as in the 1974 Summit Series, the Super Series, and the 1981 Canada Cup. Until 1977, professional players were not able to participate in the World Championship, and it was not until 1988 that they could play in the Winter Olympics. The Soviet team was populated with amateur players who were hired by Soviet enterprises (aircraft industry, food workers, tractor industry) or organizations (KGB, Red Army, Soviet Air Force) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours social sports society hockey team for their workers but were set-up for the athletes to train full-time. This type of amateur player was contested by Canada and the United States whose best players were participating in professional leagues.

===After the USSR&#x27;s dissolution===
The Soviet Union dissolved shortly before the 1992 Winter Olympics, so a Unified Team largely consisting of the former Soviet republics competed instead. The CIS national ice hockey team, composed almost entirely of Russians, with Lithuanian-born Darius Kasparaitis and Ukrainian-born Alexei Zhitnik the only non-Russians, competed as part of this Olympic delegation. The team finished second in its preliminary group, beating co-favorites Canada, 5–4, but losing to Czechoslovakia, 3–4. The CIS team then defeated the Finns and Americans, 6–1 and 5–2, respectively. In the final, they played Canada again, winning 3–1 and claimed the gold medal. The team was coached by the Russian and former Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov. In later years, the IIHF recognized this gold medal as being won by the Russian national team, rather than by the CIS. However, the International Olympic Committee has not recognized Russia as the Olympic champions for this Winter Games.

Russia joined the IIHF as an independent state on 6 May 1992, along with 10 other states, including seven other former Soviet republics. Unlike the others, which applied as new member states and had to begin playing at the bottom tiers of the World Championship, Russia was allowed to replace the Soviet Union in its position and was thus entered into the elite division for the 1992 World Championship. Russia&#x27;s first actual games after the Soviet dissolution were a series of five friendly games between Sweden, Germany and Switzerland, all taking place in April 1992, the debut game occurring on 12 April 1992 against Sweden and ending in a 2–2 draw. At the 1992 World Championship Russia finished first in its preliminary group but lost to Sweden in the quarterfinals, 2–0. They, however, won the next edition of the tournament, beating Germany, Canada, and Sweden in the playoffs and clinching their first title as Russia and 23rd, including the USSR&#x27;s totals.

===The post-Soviet drought===
As the USSR fell apart, so did Russia&#x27;s elite hockey program. At the 1994 Winter Olympics they finished fourth overall, losing the bronze medal match to Finland. Russia also competed at the 1996 World Cup, the successor tournament to the Canada Cup, where the team lost in the semi-finals to the eventual winner, the United States. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Russia won five consecutive games and reached the gold medal match, where they lost to the Czech Republic, 0–1.

In 1994, Russian journalist Vsevolod Kukushkin reported that &quot;The people are upset. Russia is a nation of critics.&quot; He said the Russian team was struggling with finances to support training, no funding was received from the national level, and professional teams in Russia were struggling to stay afloat. He also reported that the Russian people were upset at losing the nation&#x27;s best players to the National Hockey League, and not playing on the Russian national team.

===The Russian resurgence===
====The Bykov period====
After failing to win the gold medal between 1993 and 2007, the Russians restructured the national league as the KHL and hired the 1993 World Champion, Vyacheslav Bykov, as the head coach. Another 1993 champion, Sergey Fedorov, was named the team captain. Afterwards, Russia won the 2008 and 2009 World Ice Hockey Championships with perfect records, beating Canada in the finals two times in a row. The Russians would make another run in 2010, losing to the Czech Republic in the gold medal game. However, the disastrous 2010 Olympics and 2011 World Championships led to Bykov&#x27;s removal.

====Bilyaletdinov at the helm====
Bykov was replaced with Bilyaletdinov, under whose leadership Russia won the 2012 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships with yet another perfect record, beating Slovakia, 6–2, in the gold medal game. However, as a result of the 2013 Championship and 2014 Olympic performances, Bilyaletdinov was replaced with Oleg Znarok.

====The Znarok years==== 
Znarok then led the Russians to the gold medal in the 2014 World Ice Hockey Championship after defeating Finland 5–2 in the final, with a perfect record. The 2014 tournament result set the most perfect records in the IIHF World Championships. For this accomplishment, the Russian team was honored in the Kremlin.

Russia earned a medal in each subsequent tournament, including the silver medal in 2015 and the bronze medals in 2016 and 2017. The team also reached the semi-finals of the World Cup, losing to Canada, the eventual winner.
In 2018, the Russian Olympic Committee was disqualified by the International Olympic Committee for doping, but the Russian players were cleared to participate by the IOC under the Olympic flag as the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) using professional Russian hockey players with no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing. Like the rest of the Olympic hockey teams in 2018, the Russian team could not use NHL players due to the league&#x27;s prohibiting player participation in the Olympics. As a result, the team relied on players from the KHL (15 from a reigning champion, SKA Saint Petersburg, 8 from CSKA Moscow and 2 from Metallurg Magnitogorsk).

After a loss in their first game to Slovakia, the OAR team defeated Slovenia and the United States, qualifying for the quarterfinals. The team then defeated Norway and the Czech Republic to reach the finals. The team won the gold medal after a 4–3 overtime victory over the German team in the final. Kovalchuk and Pavel Datsyuk each won their first gold in their fifth Olympic appearance and together with Slava Voynov, were the only players with prior Olympic experience on the team. In its post-Olympics World Ranking, the IIHF considered the OAR team as the Russian team in its rankings. The IIHF considers this victory to be Russia&#x27;s second gold medal in the Olympics, as they also attributed the 1992 Unified Team gold medal to Russia, however, the IOC does not attribute either of these results to Russia.

After the Olympics, Znarok became a consultant for the Russian National Team. He retired as Russia&#x27;s most decorated modern head coach, with a World Championship, an Olympic gold medal, and a Euro Hockey Tour victory.

====Vorobiev as head coach====
Ilya Vorobiev was hired as the interim head coach of the Russian national hockey team in April 2018 for the 2018 IIHF World Championship and the second half of 2017–18 Euro Hockey Tour. In the remainder of Euro Hockey Tour, Vorobiev led the Russian team to a 1–5 record, following the 5–1 record of the Znarok-led team in the first half of 2017–18 Euro Hockey Tour, for the team to finish 6–6 on the season. At the 2018 World Championship, Russia finished second in its group and lost to Canada 4–5 in the quarterfinal, finishing sixth overall.

Next season, Russia went 8–4 in the 2018–19 Euro Hockey Tour, winning the competition and went all the way to the semi-final at the 2019 World Championship, where it lost to Finland before beating the Czech Republic for the bronze. Following the World Championship, Vorobiev was dismissed and replaced with Alexei Kudashov.

====Kudashov&#x27;s realm====
Kudashov went 3–6 at the 2019–20 Euro Hockey Tour before the 2020 IIHF World Championship was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia. Kudashov was sacked in June 2020 and replaced with Valeri Bragin, a decorated coach of the Russia men&#x27;s U20 team.

====Bragin&#x27;s team====
Bragin proceeded to win the 2020–21 Euro Hockey Tour with a 10–2 record. At the 2021 IIHF World Championship, Russia went 6–1 in the group stage but then lost in the quarter-finals to Canada, which finished with a 3–4 record in the group stage but went on to win the tournament. Bragin was replaced by Alexei Zhamnov in September 2021.

====Zhamnov&#x27;s team====
With Zhamnov the Russian national team participated at the 2022 Olympics in Beijing (under the Russian Olympic Committee flag and the moniker ROC), where they reached the second Olympic final in a row, losing to Finland 1–2 and winning silver medals.

After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Ice Hockey Federation suspended Russia from all levels of competition. In April 2022, the Federation banned Russia from participating in the 2023 IIHF World Championship.

Due to the ban, a second Russian team consisting of players under 25 took part in the 2023 Channel One Cup alongside the main roster, and newcomers Kazakhstan and Belarus.

===Euro Hockey Tour===
The Euro Hockey Tour (EHT) started in 1996 and is held every season between the quartet of European nations of the Big Six nations of ice hockey. The usual format is to have the teams play against each other four times, once in Finland, once in Russia, once in Sweden, and once in the Czech Republic. There are occasional deviations from the format if additional nations, such as Canada, are invited to compete. Russia has won the EHT nine times .

<text>Cheque fraud or check fraud (American English) refers to a category of criminal acts that involve making the unlawful use of cheques in order to illegally acquire or borrow funds that do not exist within the account balance or account-holder&#x27;s legal ownership. Most methods involve taking advantage of the &quot;float&quot; (the time between the negotiation of the cheque and its clearance at the cheque writer&#x27;s financial institution) to draw out these funds. Specific kinds of cheque fraud include cheque kiting, where funds are deposited before the end of the float period to cover the fraud, and paper hanging, where the float offers the opportunity to write fraudulent cheques but the account is never replenished.

==Types of cheque fraud==

===Cheque kiting===

Cheque kiting full refers to use of the float to take advantage and delay the notice of non-existent funds.

=== Embezzlement ===
While some cheque kiters fully intend to bring their accounts into good standing, others, often known as &quot;paper hangers&quot;, have pure fraud in mind, attempting to &quot;take the money and run.&quot;

==== Bad cheque writing ====
A cheque is written to a merchant or other recipient, hoping the recipient will not suspect that the cheque will not clear. The buyer will then take possession of the cash, goods, or services purchased with the cheque, and will hope the recipient will not take action or will do so in vain.

==== Cheque conversion ====
A cheque is endorsed by a non-payee of the cheque and then cashed or deposited fraudulently. The non-payee will then have cash free and clear, and will hope the true recipient will not find out until much later.

==== Abandonment ====
The paper hanger deposits a cheque one time that they know is bad or fictitious into their account. When the bank considers the funds available (usually on the next business day), but before the bank is informed the cheque is bad, the paper hanger then withdraws the funds in cash. The offender knows the cheque will bounce, and the resulting account will be in debt, but the offender will abandon the account and take the cash.

Such crimes are often used by petty criminals to obtain funds through a quick embezzlement, and are frequently conducted using a fictitious or stolen identity in order to hide that of the real offender.

This form of fraud is the basis for the Nigerian cheque scam and other similar schemes; however, in these cases, the victim will be the one accused of committing such crimes, and will be left to prove their innocence.

=== Forgery ===
Sometimes, forgery is the method of choice in defrauding a bank. There are three main types of cheque forgery: (a) Counterfeit. This is a cheque that has been created on non-bank paper to look genuine. It relates to a genuine account. (b) Forged signature. The cheque is genuine, but the signature is not that of the account holder. (c) Fraudulently altered. In this case a genuine cheque has been made out by the genuine customer but it has been altered by a fraudster, typically by altering the recipient’s name or by adding words and/or digits in order to inflate the amount. In England and Wales, section 64 of the Bills of Exchange Act of 1882 provides that where a bill or an acceptance is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable on the bill, the bill is made void except when used against a party who has himself made, authorised or assented to the alteration, and subsequent endorsers.

Other cases include that of Frank Abagnale, where the perpetrator passes or attempts to pass a cheque that has been manufactured by him/herself, but which represents a non-existent account.

=== Unusual cases ===
Cheque washing involves the theft of a cheque in transit between the writer and recipient, followed by the use of chemicals to remove the ink representing all parts other than the signature. The perpetrator then fills in the blanks to his or her advantage.

Sometimes the cheque fraud comes from an employee of the bank itself, as was the case with Suzette A. Brock, who was convicted of theft for writing five corporate cheques to her own birth name from her desk as a loan servicing agent for Banner Bank of Walla Walla, WA.

The most notorious &quot;bad cheque artist&quot; of the 20th century, Frank Abagnale, devised a scheme to put incorrect MICR numbers at the bottom of the cheque he wrote, so that they would be routed to the incorrect Federal Reserve Bank for clearing. This allowed him to work longer in one area before his criminal activity was detected. In the movie &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, which outlines Abagnale&#x27;s crime spree, it shows Abagnale soaking plastic Pan Am airplanes in his bathtub and removing the Pan Am insignia on the toys. He would then place the decals on the bad cheques he was writing while pretending to be a Pan Am pilot. The film depicts Abagnale amassing over $2.5 million, while in reality he collected just under $1,500.

==Combating cheque fraud==
In most jurisdictions, passing a cheque for an amount of money the writer knows is not in the account at the time of negotiation (or available for overdraft protection) is usually considered a violation of criminal law. However, the general practice followed by banks has been to refrain from prosecuting cheque writers if the cheque reaches the bank after sufficient funds have been deposited, thereby allowing it to clear. But the account holder is normally held fully liable for all bank penalties, civil penalties, and criminal charges allowable by law in the event the cheque does not clear the bank.

Only when the successful clearance of a cheque is due to a kiting scheme does the bank traditionally take action. Banks have always had various methods of detecting kiting schemes and stopping them in the act. Computer systems in place will alert bank officials when a customer engages in various suspicious activities, including frequently depositing cheques bearing the same, large monthly total deposits accompanied by near-zero average daily balances, or avoidance of tellers by frequent use of ATMs for deposits.

New technology in place today may make most forms of cheque kiting and paper hanging a thing of the past. As new software rapidly catches illegal activity at the teller/branch level instead of waiting for the nightly runs to the back office, schemes are not only easier to detect, but may be prevented by tellers who deny customers illegal transactions before they are even started.

Part of how banks are combating cheque fraud is to offer their clients fraud protection services. Because it is impossible for banks to know every cheque that a customer writes and which may or may not be fraudulent, the onus is on the clients to make the bank aware of what cheques they write. These systems allow customers to upload their cheque files to the bank including the cheque number, the amount of money, and in some cases, the payee name. Now, when a cheque is presented for payment, the bank scrubs it against the information on file. If one of the variables does not match, then the cheque would be flagged as a potentially fraudulent item.

These services help with external fraud but they do not help if there is internal fraud. If an employee sends information to the bank with fraudulent items, then the bank would not know to deny payment. A system of dual controls should be put into place in order to not allocate all capabilities to one person.

Before the passage of the &quot;Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act&quot;, when cheques could take three or more days to clear, &quot;playing the float&quot; was fairly common practice in the US in otherwise-honest individuals who encountered emergencies right before payday.

Circular and abandonment frauds are gradually being eliminated as cheques will clear in Bank B the same day they are deposited into Bank A, giving no time at all for non-existent funds to become available for withdrawal. With image-sharing technology, the funds that temporarily become available in Bank A&#x27;s account are wiped out the same day.

While there may still be some room for retail kiting, security measures taken by retail chains are helping reduce such incidents. Increasingly, more chains are limiting the amount of cash back received, the number of times cash back can be offered in a week or a given period of time, and obtaining transactional account balances before offering cash back, thereby denying it to those with low balances. For example, Walmart&#x27;s policy is to determine account balances of those obtaining cash back, and some Safeway locations will not offer cash back on any accounts with balances under $250, even when funds are sufficient to cover the amount on the cheque. Customers who are noted to obtain cash back frequently are also investigated by the corporation to observe patterns.

Some businesses will also use the cheque strictly as an informational device to automatically debit funds from the account, and will return the item to the customer thereafter. However, in the United States this is done through the ACH Network; though faster than traditional cheque clearing, contrary to popular belief the ACH Network is not instantaneous. Though this practice reduces the room for kiting (by reducing float), it does not always eliminate it.

== 2024 Chase Bank glitch ==
In August and September of 2024, a viral &quot;money hack&quot;, which was actually a form of cheque fraud, circulated on TikTok claiming that Chase Bank account holders could give themselves large amounts of money by writing a cheque, cashing it, and quickly withdrawing the money from an ATM. This was the result of a glitch that allowed users to withdraw money before the bank verified that the cheque was legitimate.

<text>Xi Boötis, Latinised from ξ Boötis, is a binary star system located at a distance of 22 light-years away from Earth. It is the nearest visible star in the constellation Boötes. The brighter, primary component of the pair has a visual magnitude of 4.70, making it visible to the naked eye.

==Properties==

The primary star in this system is a BY Draconis variable with an apparent magnitude that varies from +4.52 to +4.67 with a period just over 10 days long, and is classified as a G-type main-sequence star. The magnetic activity in the star&#x27;s chromosphere varies with time, but no activity cycle has yet been found. It has 88% of the mass and 82% of the radius of the Sun, but shines with just 56% the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. The secondary component is a K-type star with just 66% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 61% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. As of 2019, it is located at an angular separation of from the primary, along a position angle of 298°.

The pair follow a wide, highly elliptical orbit around their common barycenter, completing an orbit every 151.5 years. Radial velocities taken of the primary as part of an extrasolar planet search show a linear trend in the velocities which is likely due to the secondary star. The pair can be resolved even through smaller telescopes. The binary system contains some of the closest young solar-type stars to the Sun, with a system age of about 200 million years old.

The primary star (A) has been identified as a candidate for possessing a Kuiper-like belt, based on infrared observations. The estimated minimum mass of this dust disk is 2.4 times the mass of the Earth&#x27;s Moon. (Compare to the value of 8.2 lunar masses for the Kuiper belt.)

A necessary condition for the existence of a planet in this system are stable zones where the object can remain in orbit for long intervals. For hypothetical planets in a circular orbit around the individual members of this star system, this maximum orbital radius is computed to be for the primary and 3.5 AU for the secondary. A planet orbiting outside of both stars would need to be at least 108 AU distant.

Seidel was born in New York City. He played professional backgammon in his youth. He eventually became a trader on the American stock exchange stock market and later moved on to poker.

Seidel was one of the group of now famous players from the former Mayfair Club in New York City, including Stu Ungar, Jay Heimowitz, Mickey Appleman, Howard Lederer, Jason Lester, Steve Zolotow, Paul Magriel, and Dan Harrington.

==Poker career==

===World Series of Poker===
In his first major poker tournament, Seidel was runner-up in the 1988 World Series of Poker Main Event to Johnny Chan. This final hand was featured in the 1998 movie &quot;Rounders&quot;. Seidel made the WSOP Main Event final table again in 1999, finishing in fourth place in the event won by Noel Furlong.

Seidel won his first WSOP bracelet in 1992. Seidel has won bracelets in five different games, including Hold&#x27;em, Omaha, and Deuce to Seven Draw. 

On December 9, 2023, Seidel won his tenth bracelet in the $50,000 Super High Roller at WSOP Paradise (Bahamas) for $1,704,400 to tie Doyle Brunson, Johnny Chan, and Phil Ivey for second most WSOP bracelets all time.

During the sixth season of the World Poker Tour (WPT), Seidel won the 2008 WPT Foxwoods Poker Classic, earning $992,890.

<doc id="950346" wikidata="Q7442110" url="?curid=950346" title="Seattle Hempfest">
<text>Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in the city of Seattle, Washington, United States, (and the world&#x27;s largest annual gathering) advocating the legalization of cannabis. Vivian McPeak serves as the organization&#x27;s executive director. Founded in 1991 as the Washington Hemp Expo, a self-described &quot;humble gathering of stoners&quot; attended by only 500 people, and renamed the following year as Hempfest, it has grown into a three-day annual political rally, concert, and arts and crafts fair with attendance typically over 100,000. Speakers have included Seattle city council member Nick Licata, actor/activist Woody Harrelson (2004), travel writer and TV host Rick Steves (2007), (2010), 2012 Green Party speaker Jill Stein, Dallas Cowboys center Mark Stepnoski (2003), and former chief of the Seattle Police Department Norm Stamper (2006). Hempfest has also in recent years attracted such well-known performers as Fishbone (2002), The Kottonmouth Kings (2004), Rehab (2006), and Pato Banton (2007) to its five stages spread throughout Myrtle Edwards Park and Elliott Bay Park, on Seattle&#x27;s waterfront.

==History==
Early Hempfests &quot;featured blatant marijuana smoking&quot;; 60 people were cited for illegal marijuana use at the 1997 Hempfest, and about 20 were arrested the following year. Eventually Hempfest and the police reached a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;: there was only one arrest in 2001. About this time, the director was Dominic Holden, who was also campaign manager of an organization trying to make cannabis the city of Seattle&#x27;s lowest law enforcement priority through a voter initiative, . The political context surrounding marijuana in Seattle and Washington has changed considerably over the years. Washington legalized medical marijuana in 1998. In 2003, Seattle passed I-75.

The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 16–17, set a new record for attendance, topping 310,000 people. The volunteers of Seattle Hempfest were awarded the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) award for &quot;Outstanding Cannabis Advocate of the Year Award&quot; on October 17, 2008 at the National NORML Conference for their efforts.

2011 Hempfest speakers included numerous elected officials, among them Ohio congressman Dennis Kucinich, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, City Attorney Pete Holmes, a return by Councilman Licata, and Washington State Representatives Mary Lou Dickerson and Roger Goodman.

2013 saw the legalization of cannabis use in Washington state; that year&#x27;s Seattle Hempfest featured performances by Everlast, Hed PE and DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill. As of 2013, the festival had an annual budget of approximately $700,000.

The 2015 Hempfest named David Bronner, CEO of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps, the Cannabis Activist of the Year.

The 2020 Hempfest was the most recent event, with the organizers stating they are planning to return in 2024.

<doc id="950352" wikidata="Q1535123" url="?curid=950352" title="Waimakariri River">
<text>The Waimakariri River is one of the largest rivers in Canterbury, on the eastern coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It flows for in a generally southeastward direction from the Southern Alps across the Canterbury Plains to the Pacific Ocean.

The river rises on the eastern flanks of the Southern Alps, eight kilometres southwest of Arthur&#x27;s Pass. For much of its upper reaches, the river is braided, with wide shingle beds. As the river approaches the Canterbury Plains, it passes through a belt of mountains, and is forced into a narrow canyon (the Waimakariri Gorge), before reverting to its braided form for its passage across the plains. It enters the Pacific north of Christchurch, near the town of Kaiapoi.

Instead of being unoccupied Crown land as are most New Zealand river beds, the bed of the Waimakariri River is vested in the Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury).

==Name==
The name &quot;Waimakariri&quot; comes from the Māori words , meaning &quot;water&quot;, and , meaning &quot;cold&quot;. The river was briefly renamed as the &quot;Courtenay River&quot; in 1849 by the chief surveyor of the Canterbury Association, Joseph Thomas, in honour of Lord Courtenay. However, this name quickly fell into disuse in favour of the traditional Māori name. The Waimakariri is colloquially referred to as the &#x27;Waimak&#x27;, a shortening of the Māori name.

==Geography==
The source of the Waimakariri is located in the Southern Alps, at the head of a valley to the west of Arthur&#x27;s Pass, where it is primarily fed by snow melt and glacial runoff. The river flows in a southerly direction, before turning east around the base of Mount Stewart. The river at this stage becomes braided, and is joined by the Bealey River as it flows across wide shingle beds.

As the river is joined by the Esk River, the Waimakariri river is forced into a narrow series of gorges and ceases being braided. This continues as the river flows through the foothills of the Southern Alps, and its valley is used by the Midland Line railway as part of its traverse of the Southern Alps. The river exits the foothills at the Waimakariri Gorge, at which point it again expands to a braided system.

Once on the Canterbury Plains, the Waimakariri flows in a roughly east-south-easterly direction towards the Pacific Ocean. As with other braided river systems, the main channels frequently change within the primary riverbed, especially during periods of high flow rates. Geological evidence indicates that this mobility has extended to the river itself in the past, at times flowing through the current location of Christchurch into what is now the Avon Heathcote Estuary, and in a different era flowing into Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora, to the south of Banks Peninsula. To protect Christchurch and other settlements near the river, multiple flood protections have been constructed either side of the river since European settlement, dating as early as the Canterbury Rivers Act 1868.

The river currently reaches the Pacific Ocean just to the north of Christchurch, entering Pegasus Bay by way of Brooklands Lagoon. The Waimakariri marks one of only a few breaks in the roughly length of Pegasus Bay. Along with two other rivers which enter Pegasus Bay (Ashley River / Rakahuri and Waipara River), the Waimakariri is almost entirely responsible for the sediment which forms the bay and its coastal plain.

==Bridges==

Due to the size of the river, only a limited number of bridges cross the Waimakariri. From upstream to downstream, the current bridges are:

;Waimakariri Falls
This simple suspension bridge is just downstream from the Waimakariri Falls located on a tramping track close to the Waimakariri Falls Hut.

;Bealey Bridge
The Bealey Bridge is located immediately upstream from where the Bealey River flows into the Waimakariri. It is part of State Highway 73. Bealey Bridge is single-lane, with a passing bay in the middle. It is in a remote location and does not cater for pedestrians.

;Midland Line bridge #42
Some downstream from the Bealey Bridge, the Midland Line crosses the river. KiwiRail records this bridge as number 42 on its bridge asset list. It is located where Red Beech Stream flows into the Waimakariri.

;Mount White Bridge
The Mount White Bridge is, &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, located downstream from the KiwiRail bridge. It is much older than the Bealey Bridge. The abutment on the left bank of the Waimakariri is located within the delta created by the Hawdon River.

;Waimakariri Gorge Bridge
The Waimakariri Gorge Bridge is, &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, located downstream from the Mount White bridge. This bridge was completed in 1877 and originally served both road and rail traffic (of the Oxford Branch). The bridge is on the register of Heritage New Zealand as a Category II structure.

;SH1 Waimakariri Bridges
The SH1 Waimakariri Bridges are twin bridges connecting Christchurch with the region north of the Waimakariri River via State Highway 1. It is located downstream from the Waimakariri Gorge Bridge. As part of the Christchurch Northern Motorway, each bridge was widened from two to three lanes during 2020, plus a cycleway added.

;Main North Road bridge
Just downstream from the state highway bridges is the Main North Road bridge, often referred to as the Old Waimakariri Bridge. This two-lane traffic bridge does not cater for walking or cycling.

;Main North Line bridge #17
Immediately downstream from the Main North Road bridge, the Main North Line crosses the river. Kiwirail records this bridge as number 17 on its bridge asset list.

==Ecology==
As one of the largest rivers on the Canterbury plains, the Waimakariri is an important habitat for wildlife, including many endangered species of plants and animals. The dry sections of riverbed are home to black-fronted terns, where braids in the river provide a natural barrier to predators. The river and its tributaries are home to native species, including crayfish / &quot;kōura&quot;, New Zealand longfin eel, short-finned eel, lamprey and many species of invertebrates. The river is one of the few remaining habitats for the critically endangered Canterbury mudfish (kowaro), which previously inhabited wetlands across the Canterbury plains, while a portion of its riverbank is home to one of only two known remaining populations of &quot;Olearia adenocarpa&quot;.

Introduced fish are common along the entirety of the Waimakariri River, making the river a popular location for fishing. As with most of New Zealand, this primarily includes brown and rainbow trout, as well as Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;). The salmon population dates to the early 1900s, when they were introduced from California, and results in large salmon runs near the river mouth in summer.

==Development==

In 1923 the river was mainly investigated for a hydroelectric dam to supply electricity to Christchurch. It received support from the community but the dam was never built since the Government offered inexpensive electricity from the Lake Coleridge scheme.

The Central Plains Water Trust is proposing to take of water from two points on the Waimakariri River as part of the Central Plains Water enhancement scheme.

==Pollution==
In 2007 the Waimakariri was ranked as one of the ten most polluted of the larger rivers in New Zealand. Some of the pollution was caused by liquid wastes from industries such as a meat processing plant and wool scourers in the vicinity of the river. The wastes were discharged directly into it but as of 2012 it was piped to the municipal sewage treatment plant. There had been some non-compliance issues with the resource consents for water discharge.

== Cultural references ==
The Waimakiriri River is described in several works by author Ruth France. Her poem &quot;After Flood&quot;, published under the pseudonym &quot;Paul Henderson&quot;, describes &quot;the alive / Roar of the river loud on the loose&quot;, and as being an &quot;age-long wanderer, age-wily&quot;. Her novel, &quot;Ice Cold River&quot; (1961), describes the flooding of a family farm at Christmas after the Waimakariri River bursts through a stopbank:The water advanced so slowly and quietly that it seemed no more than the tide making in an estuary backwater... [Q]uite suddenly, the lake of water seemed to lift itself, hurled itself over the garden and against the house in a wave that thumped as did a blasting operation at a distance. Immediately the house was surrounded, and the wave went on, eating up the fields with rapid teeth of dirty foam, in which sticks and grass and debris turned over, were engulfed, and reappeared in an endless sucking whirlpool.&#x27;

<text>Cara Elizabeth Dillon (born 21 July 1975, in Dungiven, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland) is a Northern Irish folk singer. In 1995, she joined the folk supergroup Equation and signed a record deal with Warners Music Group. After leaving the group, she collaborated with Sam Lakeman under the name Polar Star. In 2001, she released her first solo album, &quot;Cara Dillon&quot;, which featured traditional songs and two original Dillon/Lakeman compositions. The album was an unexpected hit in the folk world, with Dillon receiving four nominations at the 2002 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

Dillon&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot; (2003), entered the Irish album charts and UK Indie album charts. In 2004, Dillon received the Meteor Irish Music Award for Best Irish Female. Her third album, &quot;After the Morning&quot;, was released in 2006. The album&#x27;s opening track “Never in a Million Years” gained Radio 2 Airplay, while other tracks featured the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and Paul Brady. Also in 2006, Dillon sang at the opening of the Ryder Cup in Ireland.

In 2009, Dillon released her fourth album, the award-winning &quot;Hill of Thieves&quot;. The record marked a return to Dillon&#x27;s traditional roots with a purer production and arrangement style. The titular track “Hill of Thieves”, a Dillon\Lakeman original, was voted by BBC listeners as one of the “Top 10” original songs to have come out of Northern Ireland. The album also won &#x27;Folk Album of the Year&#x27; at the 2010 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

Dillon&#x27;s fifth solo album, &quot;A Thousand Hearts&quot;, was released in 2014. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, Dillon discovered that her music enjoyed a dedicated following in China, where her first album featured in English curriculums. She has since embarked on several popular Chinese tours. 

Her next release was the Christmas themed album, &quot;Upon a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot; which was followed in 2017 by &quot;Wanderer&quot;.

Despite her relatively low profile in the world of mainstream music, Dillon’s voice has been acclaimed by notable artists such as Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding.

As of 2023, Dillon continues to tour regularly and work with her husband, Sam Lakeman, who backs her on piano and guitar. 

Dillon is the sister of fellow folk singer Mary Dillon, formerly of Déanta.

In 2024, Dillon released a new album, &quot;Coming Home&quot;, that &quot;[blurs] the lines between spoken word and song, featuring her original poetry and music, inspired by the daily lives of the people, places and ancestry she holds closest to her heart&quot;. 

==Biography==

===The early years (1991–1995)===
Dillon comes from an area steeped in Irish traditional music. Since she was a schoolgirl she has sung and performed. She learned local folk songs from teachers and workshops held in the town. She can also play the fiddle and whistles. At the age of 14 she won the All Ireland Singing Trophy at Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann.

In 1991 she formed a band called Óige (an Irish word meaning &#x27;youth&#x27;) with school friends Murrough and Ruadhrai O&#x27;Kane, bringing her take on Irish traditional songs to Ireland, Scotland and further afield. During this time she also performed with big names such as De Dannan and Phil Coulter. Óige recorded two albums with Dillon: a studio and a live album. &quot;Inspiration&quot; was recorded in 1992 to sell at concerts in Europe. The live album, simply called &quot;Live&quot;, was recorded at a concert in Glasgow on 15 August 1993. A cassette tape version also exists under the name &quot;Live in Glasgow&quot;. Dillon left Óige in 1995 after being asked to replace Kate Rusby in a so-called folk supergroup Equation; however, she guests on their second studio album, &quot;Bang On&quot;, playing fiddles on the last track, &quot;Maids of Mitchelstown&quot;.

===Blanco y Negro Records (1995–2000)===
Equation comprised five members: Sean Lakeman, Sam Lakeman, Seth Lakeman, Kathryn Roberts and Dillon. They signed a major record deal with Blanco y Negro (part of Warner Music Group) and recorded an album at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Realworld Studios in winter 1995–&#x27;96. The album, entitled &quot;Return to Me&quot;, was produced by David Bottrill. There was a single release, &quot;He Loves Me&quot;, with an accompanying promotional video. The band performed on MTV and VH1, but weeks before the release of the album the record label shelved it. It was not released in 1996, but in 2003 it saw a release under Rough Trade after Geoff Travis (the band&#x27;s former manager) bought its rights.

Dillon left Equation with original band member Sam Lakeman because of musical differences and together they immediately signed a separate deal with the same label. The duo was known as &quot;Polar Star&quot;. During this time Dillon formed a strong musical partnership with Lakeman. They recorded several albums with top songwriters and producers in the UK and San Francisco, but none of their work was released. Dillon provided the vocals to the song &quot;Man in the Rain&quot; on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Tubular Bells III&quot;, where she was credited as &quot;Cara from Polar Star&quot;. By 2000, Dillon and Lakeman had decided that they would never be able to give the label what they wanted. Circa summer 2000, Dillon and Lakeman ended their five-year relationship with Warner Music Group and signed to Indie label Rough Trade Records.

===Rough Trade Records (2001–2007)===

Dillon recorded her first album in The Firs, Lakeman&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. There were also recordings made in County Donegal, Ireland. The album was produced and recorded by Lakeman and mixed by John Reynolds (Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Damien Dempsey). It contained nine traditional songs Dillon had since her schooldays and also had two original Dillon/Lakeman songs &quot;Blue Mountain River&quot; (which became a single in her native land) and &quot;I Wish I Was&quot;. The album was released on 16 July 2001, to critical acclaim. The reaction to the album, according to Dillon, was very unexpected. The opening track of the album is &quot;Black is the Colour&quot;. The track was given a more modern arrangement by Lakeman with Hammond organs and bass playing combined with a piano riff. Dillon&#x27;s vocal earned her comparisons to Kate Bush. Throughout 2001 and 2002, Dillon toured the album extensively in the UK, Ireland and Europe and her fan base grew steadily. The album won many awards and got very positive reviews. The couple ended 2002 on a high with their marriage in December.

The follow-up album, &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot;, was released on 22 September 2003. In terms of sales and airplay, the album was a bigger success. Sales were helped by the inclusion of Dillon&#x27;s popular version of &quot;There Were Roses&quot; (notably featured on the BBC series &quot;Billy Connolly&#x27;s World Tour of England, Ireland and Wales&quot;). The album entered the Irish album charts and the UK indie album charts. The album was promoted with songs &quot;High Tide&quot;, &quot;There Were Roses&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot;. The album also had a more balanced mix of traditional and original material, including another Kate Bush-esque track, &quot;Falling Like a Star&quot; and &quot;Broken Bridges&quot;. Both songs showed Dillon and Lakeman&#x27;s songwriting could successfully cross musical borders. The album was again produced by Lakeman and mixed by John Reynolds and Alan Branch and was recorded &quot;at home in Somerset&quot;.

In January 2004, Dillon travelled to Japan on a promotional tour of the album. Dillon&#x27;s solo career up this point was polished with her receiving &quot;The Meteor Irish Music Award&quot; for Best Irish Female. With two albums under her belt, Dillon&#x27;s music was showcased on an international scale. Her relationship with WOMAD played a crucial part in this. The couple returned to the studio again in summer 2004 to record their third album.

Her third album, &quot;After the Morning&quot;, was released on 27 February 2006. The album was the longest in the making to date and featured several guest appearances. The Czech Philharmonic Orchestra recorded for two tracks on the album, &quot;Garden Valley&quot; &amp; &quot;The Snows They Melt The Soonest&quot;; Martin Simpson, the acclaimed blues guitarist featured on &quot;Grace&quot;; two of Ireland&#x27;s finest traditional musicians Mairtin O&#x27;Connor and Cathal Hayden perform on &quot;Bold Jamie&quot; and Cara duetted with Paul Brady on album highlight &quot;The Streets of Derry&quot;. 

The album gave Dillon her most successful radio hit to date, &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot;, garnering a good amount of airplay on radio stations in the UK and Ireland. The song featured on the Radio 2 playlist for six weeks and was record of the week on BBC Radio Ulster and RTÉ Radio 1. Despite the encouraging reception of the song, an official single release was never given to the song and it was released on download-only by iTunes a week prior to the album release and climbed into the top 40 most downloaded songs that week. An official single release was planned for after the album came out but it did not happen. The next single to be released from the album was a double A side: &quot;This Time/I Wish You Well&quot;. It featured a new radio mix of &quot;This Time&quot; with added vocals and guitars. The single generated some airplay on Radio 2 in July 2006 and was scheduled for release on 14 August, however Rough Trade cancelled it, citing a lack of airplay.

===Charcoal Records (2008–present)===
In January 2008, Cara and her band recorded a DVD &quot;The Redcastle Sessions&quot; in County Donegal which led to an extensive tour starting in the May and continuing through the folk festival season to the winter of 2008/9. This tour took in venues across Ireland, Great Britain and The USA and introduced guitarist John Smith as a duet partner on the single &quot;If I Prove False&quot;, this single and a fourth album &quot;Hill of Thieves&quot; (released 26 January 2009) saw Cara move to her own label Charcoal Records. Despite the move from Rough Trade, Hill of Thieves was to become Dillon&#x27;s best-selling album and was named Folk Album of the Year at the 2010 BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

The success of &quot;Hill of Thieves&quot; meant that the follow up &quot;A Thousand Hearts&quot; was not released until 2014. Similar to &quot;Hill of Thieves&quot; it features more traditional production and arrangements than Dillon’s first three albums. The album contains traditional songs (including two sung in Irish Gaelic) as well as two modern covers, &quot;Shotgun Down the Avalanche&quot; by Shawn Colvin and &quot;River Run&quot;. Released in conjunction with Sony Music, the album entered the UK indie charts at number 6. 

Dillon’s sixth solo album was 2016’s &quot;Upon a Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;, featuring eight arrangements of traditional carols and three original compositions. The album was the foundation of subsequent special Christmas shows which have been a regular part of Dillon’s tours since. 

The release of the &quot;Wanderer&quot; in 2017 saw Dillon returning to Irish folk ballads, especially the themes of emigration, both historical and contemporary. The record saw a stripped back approach with it chiefly just being Dillon on vocals with producer / husband Sam Lakeman on keyboards or guitar.   It was well received by critics upon release. &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; Neil Spencer described the album with the headline &quot;gorgeous homesick blues&quot; and awarded the album four stars. 

2021 saw the release of Dillon’s first live album ‘&quot;Live at Cooper Hall&quot;’ which featured material that had originally been broadcast as part of two special shows available free online during the Covid epidemic. The songs chosen were a wide representation of Dillon’s career to date,  ranging from fan favourite &quot;‘Black is the Colour&quot;’ to unreleased material: &quot;&quot;The Water Is Wide&quot;” and the Disney Tinkerbell film track “&quot;Come Flying With Me&quot;&quot;. 

===Notable events, collaborations and guest appearances===
Throughout Dillon&#x27;s career she has ventured into many successful collaborations with a range of artists. In 1998, she was guest vocalist (credited as &quot;Cara from Polar Star&quot;) for Mike Oldfield on the single from his &quot;Tubular Bells III&quot; album, &quot;Man in the Rain&quot;. In 2001, she featured on two tracks on the John Reynolds project &quot;Interview with the Angel&quot;, an album by &quot;Ghostland&quot;. Cara sang on the tracks &quot;Faith in Love&quot; and &quot;Sacred Touch of Beauty&quot;, the former being the album&#x27;s lead single. 2005 saw her guest on the soundtrack to &quot;Keeping Mum&quot;, a British comedy. In 2003, she performed at the Belfast Festival at Queen&#x27;s Opening Ceremony with the Ulster Orchestra. 

Also on the dance scene, Dillon&#x27;s award-winning version of &quot;Black Is The Colour&quot; was remixed by DJ Pete Devine (2Devine/Coco &amp; Green) and became an instant hit on the dance floors in 2005. Over the next year, the popularity grew steadily and the track topped many polls and became a favourite of the top DJs on the scene. Following legal difficulties with the clearance of the track the release on the Anjunabeats dance label was not until 19 March 2007. 

The year 2006 Dillon was honoured with the invitation to perform at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club in Ireland. She sang the Irish song &quot;Mo Ghile Mear&quot; to an audience estimated at 500 million worldwide with Afro Celt Sound System vocalist Iarla Ó Lionáird, a 60 piece choir and 23 piece band. In October 2006, she performed at the re-opening of the prestigious Grand Opera House in Belfast. In 2006, Judge Jules released his debut album, to which Cara provided vocals on the lead UK single &quot;Ordinary Day&quot;. The trance track was a big club hit and entered the UK dance charts at 3. 2006 also saw Dillon involved with the BBC Radio 2 Radio Ballads, and her vocals feature on the episode &quot;Thirty Years of Conflict&quot;. This was released on CD and an album of songs from the radio ballads has also been released (see Discography).

In 2009, Cara recorded the official Children in Need single, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; alongside Peter Gabriel, Terry Wogan, Hayley Westenra and others at Abbey Road Studios. In September she also recorded a live DVD called &quot;Cara Dillon – Live at the Grand Opera House&quot; in the Opera House in Belfast with the line up from her award-winning album Hill of Thieves. Acclaimed loudspeaker manufacturers Bowers &amp; Wilkins used 11 songs from this recording in their Society of Sound music club which showcases ultra high quality audio recording for audiophiles. The live recording of &quot;The Hill of Thieves&quot; was also used by Bowers &amp; Wilkins as a demonstration song in-store throughout the world on their Zeppelin Air iPod Speaker.

In 2010, Cara recorded the opening song &quot;Summer&#x27;s Just Begun&quot; for Disney&#x27;s Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue as well as narrating the opening sequence. She also sang a lullaby called &quot;Come Flying With Me&quot; featured during the credits for the movie. It reached the Box Office Top 10 upon its national cinema release in the UK in August 2010 and is the third instalment of Disney&#x27;s highly successful franchise.

In January 2012 Cara recorded the vocals on a song called &quot;Come Dream A Dream&quot; which forms the closing sequence of the nighttime spectacular show, Disney Dreams!, which was designed to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris. In the summer of 2012 Cara performed two concerts with the Ulster Orchestra. The first was to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Ulster Hall at an event called the Great Northern Songbook where &quot;Hill of Thieves&quot; was voted by BBC listeners as one of the &quot;Top 10&quot; original songs to come out of Northern Ireland. The second was a concert where the Ulster Orchestra joined Cara and her band in the Grand Opera House in Belfast.

<text>In service industries, such as education, a program manager or program director researches, plans, develops and implements one or more of the firm&#x27;s professional services. For example, in education, a program director is responsible for developing and maintaining degree-granting programs and/or other educational services.

In program management, the Program Director is a senior manager responsible for the overall success of the program.

A program director&#x27;s role in a company that sells professional services is similar to a product manager&#x27;s role in a company that sells tangible goods.

==Broadcasting==
In radio or television, a program director or director of programming is the person that decides what radio program or TV program will be broadcast and when.

==Non-profits==
In the context of non-profit organizations, a program director is responsible for managing one or more of the organization&#x27;s programs or services in a role similar to that of a chief operating officer.

<doc id="950361" wikidata="Q7760683" url="?curid=950361" title="The Riddle of Steel">
<text>The Riddle of Steel (abbreviated as TRoS) is a role-playing game (RPG) created by Jacob Norwood and published by Driftwood Publishing. It is designed for role-playing in a typical sword and sorcery or high fantasy gameworld environment.

The title of &quot;The Riddle of Steel&quot; is inspired by several references in the movie &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, including a line of dialogue in which the villain, Thulsa Doom, asks the captured Conan, &quot;What is the riddle of steel?&quot; Doom answers this question by explaining to Conan that the true strength of steel is in the hand that wields it – in other words, it is the resolve and commitment we bring to a task, not the quality or quantity of tools we use in performing it, that is the most important factor in determining success. This theme strongly influenced the design of &quot;Riddle&quot;, most particularly in the implementation of &quot;spiritual attributes&quot;.

==System==
The base mechanic of the game is a die-pool system; to accomplish tasks, players roll a pool of ten-sided dice against the target number, or &quot;TN&quot;, of the task, with the number of dice equalling or beating the TN determining degree of success. Simple rolls are made against a set TN, whereas contested rolls are made by two separate characters and the one with the most successes, wins.

The game&#x27;s combat system is based heavily on Jacob Norwood&#x27;s real-world historical martial arts studies and his experience as a martial artist. He is the president of the HEMA Alliance, was a Senior Free Scholar in the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts, and John Clements, the director of that organization, recommends the game for its martial realism. This combat system is usually marketed as one of its key selling points. Melee combatants secretly decide to attack or defend after declaring stances, sometimes resulting in tense standoffs, and then declare any maneuvers they might wish to use. The combat is swift and deadly, with every hit causing a wound from the wound charts. It is entirely possible for a combat to be over on the first round.

The other primary hallmark of the game is the character design aspect known as &quot;spiritual attributes&quot;, often abbreviated &quot;SAs&quot; by game fans. Each player in &quot;TRoS&quot; defines up to five spiritual attributes for their character, specifying the areas in which they want that character to excel and demonstrate heroism. Possibilities include: faith (defending a religion or philosophical worldview), passions (love, hate or other strong emotions for someone or something), conscience (personal ethics), drive (a particularly strong intent or purpose), destiny (a future foretold), and luck (general good fortune and coincidence). This system allows players more control over the in-game performance of their characters, by granting the player extra dice whenever the character faces an obstacle in a situation where the player wants his character to shine. It brings a slight cinematic atmosphere to the game in that the hero can suffer defeat, but has uncanny luck and persistence in the crucial elements of the story.

The Spiritual Attributes also serve as the game&#x27;s character improvement and development mechanic. Points are awarded to the attributes by the Seneschal (or game master) when characters act according to these attributes, and spent by players to increase attributes, skills, weapon proficiencies and other character aspects.

==Influences==
The game, especially the combat system, was heavily influenced by the Polish series of stories about Geralt of Rivia, known as the Witcher series. The default sample character in the book is even called Geralt after him. The official fantasy world of the game, Weyrth, also shows strong influences of our world&#x27;s history among its imaginary cultures and peoples, with some of the most well-developed being those inspired by Eastern Europe, such as &quot;Zaporozhya&quot; (from the Polish historical term for Ukraine) and the &quot;Rzeczpospolita&quot;, the Polish word for &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. For historical inspiration, see Zaporizhzhia, Rzeczpospolita and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==Current Situation and Related Systems==
&quot;The Riddle of Steel&quot; has suffered from distribution problems for years and there is a perception among fans that they are not likely to be solved.

As of early 2013, there was some worry among the fan community of &quot;The Riddle of Steel&quot; that the RPG might perhaps no longer enjoy viable commercial release channels. That was one factor that contributed to the creation of its licensed successor game Blade of the Iron Throne. &quot;Blade&quot; was published in 2013.

<text>The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is an independent agency of the United States government that administers, operates, and maintains permanent U.S. military cemeteries, memorials and monuments primarily outside the United States.

There were 26 cemeteries and 31 memorials, monuments and markers under the care of the ABMC. There are more than 140,000 U.S. servicemen and servicewomen interred at the cemeteries, and more than 94,000 missing in action, or lost or buried at sea are memorialized on cemetery Walls of the Missing and on three memorials in the United States. The ABMC also maintains an online database of names associated with each site.

==History==
The ABMC was established by the United States Congress in 1923. Its purpose is to:
* Commemorate the services of the U.S. armed forces where they have served since April 6, 1917;
* Establish suitable War memorials; designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining permanent U.S. military burial grounds in foreign countries;
* Control the design and construction of U.S. military monuments and markers in foreign countries by other U.S. citizens and organizations, both public and private;
* Encourage the maintenance of such monuments and markers by their sponsors.

The United States Department of War established eight European burial grounds for World War I. The ABMC&#x27;s first program was landscaping and erecting non-sectarian chapels at each of the eight sites, constructing 11 separate monuments and two tablets at other sites in Europe, and constructing the Allied Expeditionary Forces World War I Memorial in Washington, D.C. For those buried who could not be identified during World War I, a percentage were commemorated by Star of David markers, rather than a cross; this practice was not continued for those who could not be identified during World War II.

In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order transferring control of the eight cemeteries to the ABMC, and made the commission responsible for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of all future permanent American military burial grounds outside the United States.

The ABMC has been the caretaker of cemeteries, monuments and memorials for World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Mexican–American War. In 2013, Clark Veterans Cemetery in the Philippines became the 25th site under the control of the commission. Clark Veterans Cemetery dates back to the Philippine–American War at the turn of the 20th century. The Lafayette Escadrille Memorial Cemetery outside Paris, France was added to the commission&#x27;s responsibilities in 2017.

==Structure==
The agency has its headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and its Overseas Operations Office in Paris, France.

The authorizing legislation for the American Battle Monuments Commission (36 U.S.C., Chapter 21) specifies that the President may appoint up to 11 members to the commission (who serve indefinite terms and who serve without pay) and an officer of the Army to serve as the secretary.

<doc id="950378" wikidata="Q1584013" url="?curid=950378" title="Yakshagana">
<text>Yakshagana is a traditional theatre, developed in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Shimoga and western parts of Chikmagalur districts, in the state of Karnataka and in Kasaragod district in Kerala that combines dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques with a unique style and form. It is believed to have evolved from pre-classical music and theatre during the period of the Bhakti movement. It is sometimes simply called &quot;Aata&quot; or &quot;āṭa&quot; (meaning &quot;the play&quot;). This theatre style is mainly found in coastal regions of Karnataka in various forms. Towards the south from Dakshina Kannada to Kasaragod of Tulu Nadu region, the form of Yakshagana is called &#x27; and towards the north from Udupi up to Uttara Kannada it is called&#x27;. Both of these forms are equally played all over the region. Yakshagana is traditionally presented from dusk to dawn. Its stories are drawn from Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata and other epics from both Hindu and Jain and other ancient Indic traditions.

==Etymology==
&quot;Yakshagāna&quot; literally means the song (&quot;gāna&quot;) of the &quot;yaksha&quot; (nature spirits). Yakshagana is the scholastic name in Kannada (used for the last 200 years) for art forms formerly known as &quot;kēḷike, āṭa, bayalāṭa,&quot; and &quot;daśāvatāra&quot;. The word Yakshagana previously referred to a form of literature primarily in Kannada (starting from the 16th century). Of late Yakshaganas in Tulu and even now in Telugu are available. Performance of this Yakshagana literature or the play is called āṭa. It is now no longer believed that the word Ekkalagaana refers to Yakshagana.

===Music genre===

Yakshagana has a separate tradition of music, separate from Karnataka Sangeetha and the Hindustani music of India. Yakshagana and Karnatak Sangeetha may have a common ancestor are not decedents of one another.

A typical Yakshagana performance consists of background music played by a group of musicians (known as a &quot;himmela&quot;); and a dance and dialogue group (known as the &quot;mummela&quot;), who together enact poetic epics on stage. The himmela is made up of a lead singer (&quot;bhagawatha&quot;)—who also directs the production—and is referred to as the &quot;first actor&quot; (&quot;modalane vesha&quot;). Additional himmela members are players of traditional musical instruments, such as the &quot;maddale&quot; (hand drum), the &quot;pungi&quot; (pipe), the &quot;harmonium&quot; (organ), and the &quot;chande&quot; (loud drums). The music is based on &quot;ragas&quot;, which are characterised by rhythmic patterns called &quot;mattu&quot; and &quot;tala&quot; (or musical meter in Western music).

A Yakshagana(ಯಕ್ಷಗಾನ) performance typically begins in the twilight hours, with an initial beating of the drums of several fixed compositions, called &quot;abbara&quot; or &quot;peetike&quot;. This may last for up to an hour before the actors finally arrive on the stage. The actors wear resplendent costumes, head-dresses, and face paints.

A performance usually depicts a story from the &quot;Kavya&quot; (epic poems) and the &quot;Puranas&quot; (ancient Hindu texts). It consists of a story teller (the &quot;bhagawatha&quot;) who narrates the story by singing (which includes prepared character dialogues) as the actors dance to the music, portraying elements of the story as it is being narrated. All components of Yakshagana—including the music, the dance, and the dialogue—are improvised. Depending on the ability and scholarship of the actors, there will be variations in dances as well as the amount of dialogue. It is not uncommon for actors to get into philosophical debates or arguments without falling out of character. The acting in Yakshagana can be best categorised as method acting. The performances have drawn comparison to the Western tradition of opera. Traditionally, Yakshagana will run through dusk to dawn.

Yakshagana is popular in the districts of Dakshina Kannada, Kasaragod, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Shimoga and western parts of Chikkamagaluru . Yakshagana has become popular in Bengaluru in recent years, particularly in the rainy season, when there are few other forms of entertainment possible in the coastal districts.

==History==
===Origins===


Yakshagana can refer to a style of writing, as well as the written material itself. It was probably used for poems enacted in bayalaata (or &quot;open theatre drama&quot;), such as the ballads of Koti and Chennayya. Yakshagana in its present form is believed to have been strongly influenced by the Vaishnava Bhakti movement. Yakshagana was first introduced in Udupi by Madhvacharya&#x27;s disciple Naraharitirtha. Naraharitirtha was the minister in the Kalinga Kingdom. He also was the founder of Kuchipudi.

The first written evidence regarding Yakshagana is found on an inscription at the Lakshminarayana Temple in Kurugodu, Somasamudra, Bellary District, and is dated 1556 CE. A copy is available at the University of Madras. The inscription mentions land donated to the performers of the art, so as to enable people to enjoy &quot;tala maddale&quot; programs at the temple. Another important piece of evidence is available in the form of a poem authored by Ajapura Vishnu, the &quot;Virata Parva&quot;, inscribed on a palm-leaf found at Ajapura (present day Brahmavara). Another historic palm-leaf manuscript, dated 1621 CE, describes &quot;Sabhalakshana&quot;.

Yakshagana bears some resemblance to other members of the &#x27;traditional theatre family:&#x27; &quot;Ankhia Nata&quot; (found in Assam); &quot;Jathra&quot; (in Bengal); &quot;Chau&quot; (Bihar, Bengal); &quot;Prahlada Nata&quot; (Orissa); &quot;Veedhinatakam&quot; &amp; &quot;Chindu&quot; (Andhra); &quot;Terukoothu Bhagawathamela&quot; (Tamil Nadu), and &quot;Kathakali&quot; (Kerala). However, some researchers have argued that Yakshagana is markedly different from this group.

Experts have placed the origin of Yakshagana somewhere in the period of the 11th to 16th centuries CE. Yakshagana was an established performance art form by the time of the noted Yakshagana poet, Parthi Subba (c. 1600). His father, Venkata, is attributed by some to be the author of the great Hindu epic, Ramayana, although historian Shivaram Karanth counters these claims (made most notably by historians Muliya Thimmappa and Govinda Pai) and argues that it is Subba, who was in fact its author. Venkata is the probable founder of the tenkuthittu (southern) style of the art.

Troupe centers, such as Kudlu and Kumbla in the Kasaragod District, and Amritheshwari, Kota near Kundapura, claim to have had troupes three to four centuries ago, indicating that the art form almost certainly had begun to take shape by circa 1500.

The Yakshagana form of today is the result of a slow evolution, drawing its elements from ritual theatre, temple arts, secular arts (such as Bahurupi), royal courts of the past, and the artists&#x27; imaginations—all interwoven over a period of several hundred years.

===Early poets===
Early Yakshagana poets included Ajapura Vishnu, Purandaradasa, Parthi Subba, and Nagire Subba. King Kanteerava Narasaraja Wodeyar II (1704–1714) authored 14 Yakshaganas in various languages in the Kannada script. Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (1794–1868) also wrote several Yakshagana prasanga, including &quot;Sougandhika Parinaya&quot;. Noted poet, Muddana, composed several Yakshagana prasanga&#x27;s, including the very popular &quot;Rathnavathi Kalyana&quot;.

==Evolution==
In the 19th century, Yakshagana began to move away from the strict traditional forms. Practitioners of the day produced a number of new compositions. Also, a large number of troupes arose across coastal Karnataka.

The early 20th century saw the birth of &#x27;tent&#x27; troupes, giving performances to audiences made up of common people who were admitted by ticket. These troupes were responsible for the commercialisation of Yakshagana. The genre saw major changes in form and organisation. Electrical lights replaced the gas lights; seating arrangements improved; the inclusion of folk epics, Sanskrit dramas, and fictional stories formed the modern thematic base of the discipline. Popular entertainment became the criterion, replacing the historic classical presentations. Tulu, the language of the southern part of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi district&#x27;s was introduced; increasing popularity with the common people.

At this time, writer Kota Shivaram Karanth, experimented with the dance form by introducing Western musical instrumentation. He reduced the time of a Yakshagana performances from 12 hours to under three hours, incorporated movie plot lines, and added Shakespearean themes. Today, female artists perform in Yakshagana shows.

===Parallel forms===
Yakshagana is related to other performance art forms prevalent in other parts of Karnataka and the neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Yakshagana defies simple classification into categories such as folk, classical, or rural. It can be included in each or all of these, depending upon the rules used for classification. It is more varied and dynamic than most dance forms. Yakshagana can, however, be classified as one of many traditional dance forms. While it prevails primarily in the coastal areas of Karnataka, other dance forms (such as Doddata) are today often called by the same name. Several forms of traditional theatre – &quot;Mudalpaya&quot; (of southern Karnataka); &quot;Doddata&quot; (of northern Karnataka); &quot;Kelike&quot; (on the border with Andhra Pradesh); and &quot;Ghattadakore&quot; (of Kollegal—in the Chamarajnagar District), may be included in this category. Among them, the &quot;Ghattadakore&quot; is a direct branch of the coastal form of Yakshagana, while &quot;Mudalapaya&quot; is the most closely connected form.

====Yakshaganamu in Andhra Pradesh====
There is a form called &quot;Yakshaganamu&quot; in Andhra Pradesh, which exhibits some resemblance to the Yakshagana forms of the Karnataka plateau region and is less sophisticated as a visual art.

==Variations and subgenres==

Scholars have classified Yakshagana broadly into several types:
*Moodalopaya Yakshagana; includes eastern areas of Karnataka (such as Channarayapattna and Arsikere Taluks of the Hassan District), Nagamangala Taluk of the Mandya District, Turuvekere Taluk of the Tumkur District, Hiriyuru, Challakere of Chitradurga District and North Karnataka.
*Paduvlopaya Yakshagana comprises the western parts of extended Karnataka (including Kasaragod Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada).
* Tenkutittu (includes areas Kasaragod (Kerala), Mangalore District, Udupi, Sampaaje, Sulliya, Puttur, Bantwala, Belthangady, Karkala, etc.)
* Badagutittu (Udupi to Kundapura area, Uttara Kannada district)
* Badabadagutittu/Uttara Kannadatittu (extreme north parts of Uttara Kannada)

===Tenkutittu===
One of the traditional variations, the &quot;tenkutittu&quot; style, is prevalent in Dakshina Kannada, Kasaragod District, western parts of Coorg (Sampaje), and few areas of Udupi district. The influence of Karnatic Music is apparent in tenkutittu, as evidenced by the type of maddale used and in bhaagavathike. Yakshagana is influenced more by folk art blended with classical dance aspects. In tenkutittu, three iconic set of colours are used: the &quot;Raajabanna&quot;, the &quot;Kaatbanna&quot;, and the &quot;Sthreebanna&quot;.

The himmela in the tenkutittu style is more cohesive to the entire production. Rhythms of the chande and maddale coupled with the &quot;chakrataala&quot; and &quot;jaagate&quot; of the bhaagavatha create an excellent symphonic sound. The dance form in tenkutittu strikes the attention of the audience by &#x27;Dheengina&#x27; or &#x27;Guttu&#x27;. Performers often do &quot;dhiginas&quot; (jumping spins in the air) and will continuously spin (sometimes) hundreds of times. Tenkutittu is noted for its incredible dance steps; its high flying dance moves; and its extravagant &quot;rakshasas&quot; (demons).

Tenkutittu has remained a popular form and has its own audience outside the coastal areas. The Dharmasthala and Kateelu durgaparameshwari melas (the two most popular melas) have helped to popularise this form. Several creative tenkutittu plays have been composed by noted scholars, such as Amritha Someshwara.

===Badagutittu===
The &quot;Badagutittu&quot; style is prevalent in North Canara (Uttara Kannada District) and the northern parts of Udupi district from Kundapura to Byndoor. The Badagutittu school of Yakshagana places more emphasis on facial expressions, &quot;matugarike&quot; (dialogues), and dances appropriate for the character depicted in the episode. It makes use of a typical Karnataka chande.

The Badagutittu style was popularised by Shivram Karanth&#x27;s, &quot;Yakshagana Mandira,&quot; presented at Saligrama Village in Dakshina Kannada as a shorter more modern form of Yakshagana.

Keremane Shivarama Hegde, the founder of the Yakshagana troupe, Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali, is an exponent of the Badagutittu style of Yakshagana. He is also the first Yakshagana artist to receive the Rashtrapati Award from the president of India. He hails from the Honnavar taluk of Uttara Kannada (North Canara) District.

===Puppetry variant===
There were more than 30 string-puppet troupes in the undivided Dakshina Kannada district during the period 1910–1915 in places such as Basrur, Barkur, Kokkarne, Mudabidri.
The presentation of the puppetry in Yakshagana style is highly stylised and adheres strictly to the norms and standards of Yakshagana. The puppets (generally 18 inches high) wear costumes similar to those worn by live actors of Yakshagana, and have the same elaborate make-up, colourful headgear, and heavy jewellery. The puppeteer is known as the &quot;Suthradhara.&quot; The content in the Yakshagana puppetry, is also mainly drawn from the ancient epics.

====Background of puppetry====
Yakshagana puppetry has existed for centuries. The modern form of the art, however, was largely moulded by the brothers Laxman, Narasimha, and Manjappa Kamath; who hailed from Uppinakudru village, Kundapur taluk. Devanna Padmanabha Kamath, the grandson of Laxman Kamath infused new life into the art and performed shows all over India. Later, Kogga Devanna Kamath improved this subgenre even further, being recognised with the Tulsi Samman and Sangeet Natak Akademi Awards. His son, Bhaskar Kogga Kamath, is currently performing shows while training others in the art of Yakshagana puppetry. K. V. Ramesh is a leading puppeteer from Kasaragod. He leads the Yakshagana puppet troupe Shri Gopalakrishna Yakshagana Gombeyata Sangha.

===Ballet variant===
The second half of the 20th century saw experiments and adoptions of this art into other venues. One notable effort was that of Shivarama Karantha, who produced and exhibited &quot;Yakshagana ballet&quot;, using and training local artists. Some of the changes brought about by Karanth, however, attracted criticism. One legal decision even banned any public performance of his experimental ballets being billed as &quot;Yakshagana.&quot;

==Important components==
The artists pray to lord Ganesha before their performance. Yakshagana also ends with a prayer to Ganesha

===Raga===

Yakshagana Rāga refers to melodic framework used in Yakshagana. It is based on pre-classical melodic forms that comprise a series of five or more musical notes upon which a melody is founded. Ragas in Yakshagana are closely associated with a set of melodic forms called mattu. In the Yakshagana tradition, rāgas are associated with different times of the night throughout which the Yakshagana is performed.

===Tala===

Yakshagana Tala (Sanskrit tāla) are frameworks for rhythms in Yakshagana that are determined by a poetry style called &quot;Yakshagana Padya&quot;. Tala also decide how a composition is to be enacted by the dancers. It is similar to tala in other forms of Indian music, but differs from them structurally. Each composition is set to one or more talas, rendered by the himmela percussion artists play.

===Prasanga and literature===

Yakshagana poetry (Yakshagana Padya or Yakshagana Prasanga) is a collection of poems written to form a music drama. The poems are composed in well known Kannada metres, using a frame work of ragas and talas. Yakshagana also has its own metre (or &quot;prosody&quot;). The collection of Yakshagana poems forming a musical drama is called a &quot;Prasanga&quot;. The oldest surviving parasanga books are believed to have been composed in the 15th century. But many compositions have been lost to time. There is evidence showing that oral compositions were in use before the 15th century. The narratives of the surviving historic Yakshagana Prasangas are now often printed in paperback.


===Costumes and ornaments===
Yakshagna costumes are rich in colour. The costumes (or &quot;vesha&quot;) in Kannada depend on characters depicted in the play (prasanga). It also depends on the Yakshagana style (&quot;&quot;).

Traditionally, Badagutittu Yakshagana ornaments are made out of light wood, pieces of mirror, and coloured stones. Lighter materials, such as thermocol, are sometimes used today, although ornaments are still predominantly made of woodwork.

Yakshagana costumes consist of headgear (Kirita or Pagade), Kavacha that decorates the chest, Buja Keerthi (armlets) that decorate the shoulders, and belts (Dabu)—all made up of light wood and covered with golden foil. Mirror work on these ornaments helps to reflect light during shows and add more color to the costumes. Armaments are worn on a vest and cover the upper half of the body. The lower half is covered with kachche, which come in unique combinations of red, yellow, and orange checks. Bulky pads are used under the kachche, making the actors&#x27; proportions different in size from normal.

The character, Bannada Vesha, is used to depict monsters. This often involves detailed facial makeup taking three to four hours to complete. Males play the female roles in traditional Yakshagana. However, more recently, yakshagana has seen female artists, who perform in both male and female roles.

The character of Stree Vesha makes use of sari and other decorative ornaments.

==Instruments==

===Maddale===

The maddale is a percussion instrument and, along with the chande, is the primary rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble. It is played in a similar fashion as Mridangam.

===Taala (Bells)===
Yakshagana bells or cymbals, are a pair of finger bells made of a special alloy (traditionally five metal). They are made to fit the tone of the bhagawatha&#x27;s voice. Singers carry more than one set, as finger bells are available in different keys, thus enabling them to sing in different pitches. They help create and guide the background music in Yakshagana.

===Chande===

The Chande is a drum and, along with the maddale, is an important rhythmic accompaniment in the Yakshagana ensemble.

==Artists==
Over the centuries, hundreds of artists performed Yakshagana and some of them have gained star value, like Keremane Shivarama Hegde, Kuriya Vithala Shastry, Keremane Shambhu Hegde, Soorikumeru Govinda Bhat, Keremane Mahabala Hegde, Chittani Ramachandra Hegde, Naranappa Uppoor, Balipa Narayana Bhagawat, Karki Krishna Hasyagara and Kalinga Navada.

==Training and research==
As most troupes are associated with temples, training in the art has been confined to temple premises. The Govinda Pai Research Institute, located at MGM College, runs a &quot;Yakshagana Kalakendra&quot; in Udupi trains youngsters in this ancient dance form. It also does research work on language, rituals, and dance art forms. Srimaya Yakshagana Kalakendra, Gunavante which was founded by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde, is another notable Yakshagana Gurukula that trains Yakshagana students .

==Outside India==

Yakshagana is finding new popularity outside India. Amateur troupes have emerged in California, USA and Ontario, Canada. &quot;Yakshamitra in Canada&quot;, &quot;Yakshagana Kalavrinda&quot;, &quot;Yaksharanga in the U.S.&quot; &quot;Yakshaloka Boston&quot; are a few examples of these international troupes.

&quot;Yakshamitra&quot; founded in 2008 in Toronto, Canada, is the first full pledged Yakshagana mela outside India. It is the first to use local live music himmela for their performances. The other troupes usually use a recorded background himmela for their shows.

&quot;Yakshaloka USA&quot; was founded in New England by Raghuram Shetty in 1995 and used recorded audio for shows. Being the first build a local Yakshagana troupe (&quot;Yakshaloka Boston&quot;) in North America and introduce (Southern style) Yakshagana to this continent, he trained thousands of local Americans and inspired 5 Yakshagana troupes (Massachusetts, Washington, Florida, Northern and Southern California). Including shows like Sindh World Conference 2000, AKKA 2002, Saint Peters-burg Folk Festival 2005, Irvine Global Village 2014 etc. Yakshaloka USA has showcased hundreds of multi-lingual shows in major theatres across USA in both styles of Yakshagana. Yakshaloka promotes vibrant ancient Indian art by creating unique shows of its own, presentations in schools and Universities including worlds leading acting schools in Hollywood, training kids and adults from all over the world, joining hands with visiting artists (E.g.: Northern style legend Chittani Ramachandra Hegde troupe 2006), and sponsoring/facilitating leading artists (E.g.: Southern style legend Dr Puttur Shridhara Bhandary 2013).

Yakshagana Kalavrinda performs on the east coast of the U.S.
&quot;Yakshaloka Boston&quot; troupe has mainly the artists from Boston area and visiting artists from various parts of USA and India. The troupe has given many shows in the east coast, Midwest, southern USA.

Yaksharanga in the USA started after the visit of Yakshagana artist, Sri Chittani Ramachandra Hegde. His performance at the age of 74 was so inspiring that art lovers decided to continue his art thousands of miles away from its home. Sri Kidayuru Ganesh, who accompanied Sri Chittani, stayed back for a couple of months to train a new generation of Yakshagana artists. The initial result was a performance of Yakshagana &quot;Sudanvarjuna Kalaga&quot;. Hegde won the Padmashri Award in 2012 for his lifetime contribution to the art. Yaksharanga has since performed many shows around California.

Yakshagana Troupe, &quot;Shri Idagunji Mahaganapati Yakshagana Mandali, Keremane,&quot; headed by Shri Keremane Shambhu Hegde and Shri Keremane Shivanand Hegde, toured the U.S., and performed more than 22 programs throughout North America. The troupe visited 12 countries. This troupe was one of the first few troupes that took Yakshagana (in its traditional form) outside India (referring to their performance at Hilton Hotel, Bahrain in 1983).

==Mela or troupes==
There are about 30 full-fledged professional troupes, and about 200 amateur troupes in Yakshagana. Professional troupes go on tour between November and May, giving about 180–200 shows. There are about one thousand professional artists and many more amateurs. Further there are off season shows during the wet season, the anniversary shows, school and college students Yakshagana and of course the Talamaddale performances. Yakshagana commercial shows witness 12,000 performances per year in Karnataka generating a turnover of Rs. Six crore.

<text>The Finnish men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, nicknamed Leijonat / Lejonen (&quot;The Lions&quot; in Finnish and Swedish), is governed by the Finnish Ice Hockey Association. Finland is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;, the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Canada, the United States, Czechia, Russia, and Sweden.

Finland won the world championship in 2022, their fourth title after 1995, 2011 and 2019. A duo of silver medals (1988, 2006) remained the country&#x27;s best Olympic result until 2022 when the Finns achieved a breakthrough by winning their first Olympic gold after defeating Russia. At the Canada/World Cup, their best achievement is also a silver medal which they won in 2004.

==History==
Finland&#x27;s first appearance in an elite ice hockey competition was at the 1939 Ice Hockey World Championships in Switzerland. The result was a shared last place with Yugoslavia. Ten years later, Finland came to the 1949 Ice Hockey World Championships in Sweden. The Finns finished in 7th place by winning the consolation round. Finland&#x27;s first appearance at the Winter Olympics occurred in 1952 in Oslo.

In the 1974 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships two players were suspended for doping. They were the Swede Ulf Nilsson and the Finn Stig Wetzell who failed a drug test for the forbidden substance ephedrine. Both players were suspended for the rest of the tournament. Nilsson failed the test after Sweden&#x27;s game against Poland, which Sweden won 4–1. The game was awarded to Poland as a 5–0 forfeit. The Finn, Wetzell, failed the test after Finland&#x27;s match against Czechoslovakia, which Finland won 5–2, meaning the game was awarded to Czechoslovakia as a 5–0 forfeit. The Finns were able to defeat Czechoslovakia again on the last day, which would have earned their first medal in history, if not for the points lost in the forfeited win.

Finnish National Team played one regular season game in the World Hockey Association (WHA) against the Edmonton Oilers in 1978–79 season.

Finland was close again to winning the first medal in its history at the 1986 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, when it led 4–2 in the final minute of the medal round match against Sweden. However, in the last minute of the match Anders &quot;Masken&quot; Carlsson first narrowed Finland&#x27;s lead to one goal and then leveled the score with the help of the Finns&#x27; mistake. The match eventually ended in a 4–4 draw, meaning Finland&#x27;s ranking in the tournament was fourth place.

At the 1992 Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey World Championships, Finland&#x27;s success and silver medal came as a surprise to many Finns, as the team was not expected to much because of inexperience and the lack of success at the 1992 Albertville Winter Olympics in the same year. The medal achieved in the tournament was the first World Championship medal and the second value medal after the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, where Finland clinched a surprise silver after defeating the unmotivated USSR.

At the 1995 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, Finland achieved its first gold in international ice hockey. The Finns reached the final with a 5–0 victory over France in the quarter-finals, and a 3–0 victory over the Czech Republic in the semi-finals. In the final, Finland faced off against their hockey rivals and host of the 1995 tournament, Sweden. In the first period of the final, left wing Ville Peltonen scored a natural hat-trick, and then assisted Timo Jutila&#x27;s first period goal to give Finland a 4–0 lead, on the way to an eventual 4–1 victory.
At the 1998 Olympic men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament, Team Finland came away with bronze, after defeating the Canadian national team 3–2. Teemu Selänne led the tournament in goals scored (4) and total points achieved (10). The tournament was the first in which players from the National Hockey League (NHL) were released to participate, allowing national teams to be constructed using the best possible talent from each country. The 1998 Olympic tournament therefore came to be known as the &quot;Tournament of the Century&quot;.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Finland won a silver medal, coming close to winning in the final but losing 3–2 to Sweden. Finland&#x27;s goaltender Antero Niittymäki was named the MVP of the tournament (with only eight goals conceded throughout the whole tournament) and Teemu Selänne was voted best forward. The format was changed from the 1998 and 2002 tournaments, to a format similar to the 1992 and 1994 tournaments. The number of teams was reduced from 14 to 12. The 12 teams were split into two groups in the preliminary stage, which followed a round robin format. Each team played the other teams in their group once. The top four teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals.

At the 2006 IIHF World Championship, Finland achieved third place after winning the bronze medal game against Canada. Petteri Nummelin was named to the Media All-Star Team.

At the 2007 IIHF World Championship, Finland lost the final to the Canadian team. The final marked the second time that Finland and Canada met in the gold medal game of a World Championship, the first time being in 1994. Only a year before, in 2006 Finland had defeated Canada 5–0 in the bronze medal game. In 2007, Canada were looking on form, being undefeated coming into the playoff round, while Finland had registered two losses in the run-up to the finals. Rick Nash scored on the powerplay at 6:10 into the first period on a one-timer from the point from a pass by Cory Murphy off of Matthew Lombardi, to put Canada up 1–0. Near the middle of the period, Eric Staal scored in similar fashion also on the powerplay, assisted by Justin Williams, and Mike Cammalleri. 9:11 into the second period, Colby Armstrong scored to give the Canadians a 3–0 lead. This goal ended up as the game winner. Finland had some discipline difficulty in the first two periods, taking 6 minutes apiece in penalties in both periods. The Finns started to bring up the pressure in the last ten minutes, and Petri Kontiola scored a nice glove-side goal on Ward at 51:08 assisted by Ville Peltonen, to put the team on the board. With only 3 minutes left Antti Miettinen scored to bring Finland within one, 3–2. However, just one minute later Rick Nash scored on a skillful breakaway to put the game away, with Canada winning 4–2 and clinching the title. The Canadians were outshot 22–18, but their goaltender, Cam Ward, kept Canada in the game as he was solid between the pipes. They also were able to capitalize on the powerplay, which ended up being decisive in the Canadian win. Kari Lehtonen was voted Tournament&#x27;s best goaltender.
At the 2008 IIHF World Championship, Finland achieved third place after winning the bronze medal game 4–0 against rivals Sweden.

At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Finland again came away with the bronze, winning 5–3 against Slovakia. During the tournament, Teemu Selänne became the all-time leader for points scored in the Olympics. He notched an assist in his second game of the tournament for 37 career points, surpassing Valeri Kharlamov of the Soviet Union, Vlastimil Bubník of Czechoslovakia, and Harry Watson of Canada.

At the 2011 IIHF World Championship, Finland won its second world title, beating the Swedish national team by a score of 6–1 in the final. As two highly ranked neighboring countries, Sweden and Finland have a long-running competitive tradition in ice hockey. Before the game, mainstream media in both countries titled the match &quot;a dream final&quot;. After a goalless first period, Sweden opened the game with a 1–0 goal by Magnus Pääjärvi in the second period at 27:40. Seven seconds before the period&#x27;s end, Finland&#x27;s Jarkko Immonen scored to tie the game 1–1. Finland took the lead early in the third period, scoring two goals at 42:35 and 43:21 by Nokelainen and Kapanen. Sweden then took a time-out with ten minutes left to play but did not manage to regroup, and Finland scored a further three goals courtesy of Janne Pesonen, Mika Pyörälä and Antti Pihlström to clinch the title. Team Finland&#x27;s Jarkko Immonen led the tournament in both goals and points scored, with 9 and 12 respectively.

The Finns won their third world title at the 2019 IIHF World Championship in Slovakia, and after the cancelled tournament of 2020, they reached the final in the 2021 tournament, losing to Canada in overtime.

At the 2022 Winter Olympics, Finland won the gold medal for the first time, going undefeated and beating Russia in the final. This allowed them to rise to first place in the IIHF World Ranking for the first time ever. In May 2022, Finland won their fourth World Championship, beating Canada in overtime after a hard-fought game. This was the third Canada–Finland final in a row, and the first time the Finns won a medal on home ice.

<text>In car tuning culture, an engine swap is the process of removing a car&#x27;s original engine and replacing it with another. This may be a like-for-like replacement, or to install a non-factory specification engine. Typically, an engine swap is performed for performance, swapping-in a more powerful engine; however, an engine swap may also be performed for maintenance, where older engines may have a shortage of spare parts, and so a modern replacement may be more easily and cheaply maintained.

Swapping the engine may have negative implications on the car&#x27;s safety, performance, handling, and reliability. For example, the new engine&#x27;s different weight balance over the axles and the overall weight of the car can adversely affect the vehicle dynamics. Existing brakes, transmission, and suspension components may be inadequate to handle the increased weight and power of the new engine with either upgrades being required or premature wear and failure being likely.

Insurance companies may charge more or even refuse to insure a vehicle that has been fitted with an engine that is different from its initial configuration. For instance, in jurisdictions such as California—with its strict smog rules—it may not be possible to register a late-model vehicle with an engine swap.

== Types of engine swaps ==

Swapping to a diesel engine for improved fuel economy is a long established practice; with modern high-efficiency diesel engines, this does not necessarily mean a reduction in performance associated with older-version diesel engine swaps. For the particular application of off-road vehicles, the high torque at low speed of turbo diesels (combined with a fuel economy advantage) makes these conversions particularly effective. However, older non-electronic fuel injection diesel engines were well known for their reliability, especially in wet conditions.

An engine swap can either be to another engine intended to work in the car by the manufacturer, or one totally different. The former is much simpler than the latter. Fitting an engine into a car that was never intended to accept that engine may be more laborious and costly; modifying the car to fit the engine, modifying the engine to fit the car, and building custom engine mounts and transmission bellhousing adaptors to interface them along with a custom-built driveshaft. Some small businesses build conversion kits for engine swaps, such as the Fiat Twin cam into a Morris Minor or similar.

A common anecdote among tuners in the United States is that the easiest way to make a car faster is to drop in a more powerful engine, such as the General Motors small-block engine as used in the Corvette. The Chevrolet Vega (and its Astre, Monza, and Skyhawk sisters) is a candidate for a small-block swap; some have seen big blocks as well. Chevrolet engines have been used in such cars as Toyota Supras, BMWs, RX-7s, Mazda Miatas, Jaguar sedans, Corvairs, and Datsun 240s, 260s, and 280Zs.

In the Honda world, engine swaps include the Civic Si (B16A), the Civic Type R (B16B), Integra GSR (B18C), and the Integra Type R (B18C5) engines. More recently, swapping larger displacement Honda engines (such as the J-series V6) has become more popular. Swapping any of these motors into a lightweight 1988–2000 Honda Civic chassis can achieve greater performance.

Chrysler made many turbocharged vehicles in the 1980s, and these engines share much in common with the mass-produced naturally aspirated vehicles. It is quite common to obtain an engine from a vehicle such as a Dodge Daytona and swap it into a Dodge Aries. The Mopar Performance arm even offered a kit to upgrade the Dodge Daytona to rear wheel drive with a Mopar V8.

Engine swaps are also somewhat common within the Volkswagen tuning scene, often placing Type 2 (Bus), Type 3, and Type 4 (Squareback) engines in the Type 1 (Beetle). Water-cooled engines, such as the GTI 16-valve four, VR6, or 1.8 T are commonly swapped into the Mark II GTI, Jetta, and Corrado. Less common is the swap into a Mark 1 Golf or Cabriolet, giving an amazing power-to-weight ratio, even with minimally modified powerplants. Porsche engines are also very popular. One of the most popular options is to take the engine from a Porsche 911 super 1600. Vintage VW&#x27;s also take very well to the Subaru EJ &quot;flat four&quot; engine, which also has a factory turbo-charged variant.

In the Super GT racing series, engine swaps can be considered a way of life for the upper tier GT500 cars, most of which are provided with specially modified racing engines from the manufacturers. GT500 class rules themselves allow for any engine to be swapped into a car as long as it is from the same manufacturer. Notable examples include Toyota swapping in highly tuned 4-cylinder engines originally from the Toyota Celica into their Toyota Supra GT500 race cars.

British sports cars (such as MGs and Triumphs and Sunbeam Alpines) from the late 1960s and early 1970s were attractive and light-weight cars that had excellent suspensions. However, they were known for troublesome electrical systems, modest power levels and a certain amount of unreliability. It is popular to take one of these small classic sports cars and add a more powerful engine. The original manufacturers did this when the vehicles were current with the MGB GT V8 and the Sunbeam Tiger. The all-aluminum Buick and Oldsmobile V8 engines are a traditional choice for these cars. Swapping the stock MGB all-iron 1.8L 4-cylinder engine and 4-speed transmission for a Buick 215 V8 and a modern 5-speed transmission actually improves both cornering and acceleration because it reduces the overall weight of the car by about . Power is approximately doubled. Derivatives of that classic General Motors engine, the 3.5L, 3.9L, and 4.2L Rover V8s are also frequently used. (The original Buick / Oldsmobile, the Rover, and the related Morgan-licensed V8, are simple bolt-ins.)

Although the more recent &quot;narrow-angle&quot; 60-degree Ford and GM V6 engines—notably the GM 3.4L &quot;L32&quot;—are more compact than the Rover/Buick and Ford V8s, they usually do not equal the power-to-weight ratio of the popular 90-degree V8s frequently swapped into smaller cars. These V6s can, however, be very cost-effective and easier to fit into a variety of car bodies.

The Ford 302 (5.0L) V8, with its cast iron block, results in spectacular power-to-weight ratios for straight-line acceleration. If the Ford 302 is fitted with aluminium heads, intake, and water pump, the resulting engine only adds about to the front of an MGB, and is substantially more powerful and lighter-weight than the iron-block six-cylinder found in an MGC or TR6. An aluminium 302 performance block is available that weighs 60 lb (27 kg) less than the common iron version, and can be found in displacements of 331 and 347 ci, but those are significantly more expensive than using the common 302 internals.

The Nissan SR20DET is an all-aluminium fuel-injected DOHC turbocharged 4-cylinder. This compact engine, along with the very compact, light, and powerful Mazda 13B rotary engine, have both been transplanted into too many different cars to assemble a complete list.

<doc id="950398" wikidata="Q463087" url="?curid=950398" title="Dan Harrington">
<text>Dan Harrington (born December 6, 1945) is a professional poker player, best known for winning the Main Event at the 1995 World Series of Poker. He has earned one World Poker Tour title, two WSOP bracelets, and over six million dollars in tournament cashes in his poker career. He is also a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.

Harrington chose his own nickname &quot;Action Dan&quot; even though he is known for being a tight conservative player. He is a distant cousin to both professional golfer Pádraig Harrington and former NFL quarterback Joey Harrington.

==Early life and business career==
Harrington was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Currently residing in Santa Monica, California, Harrington is a former champion backgammon player and U.S. chess master (he won the 1971 Massachusetts State Chess Championship). Before becoming a poker professional and businessman, Harrington worked for many years as a bankruptcy lawyer. He also played poker against Bill Gates while Gates was at Harvard. Some of his earlier poker experience came from the Mayfair Club in the mid-1980s, where he played with Howard Lederer, Steve Zolotow, and Erik Seidel.

In addition to being a successful professional poker player, Harrington also works in real estate and the stock market. Mr. Harrington is a co-founder and former member of the Board of Directors of Anchor Loans, a hard money lender to fix-and-flip and rental property investors that is headquartered in Calabasas, CA. Harrington co-founded the company in 1998 with two poker buddies, Jeff Lipton and Stephen Pollack, and served as its first Chief executive officer. The trio used their poker winnings to provide quick bridge funding to real estate rehabbers. Anchor Loans has since funded more than 5.3 billion in loans and has been profitable every year since its inception. Harrington retired from Anchor Loans in 2010, but remains a shareholder. He has also stated during interviews about his poker career, that he is there for the money, not the fame or glory. Also unlike many professional poker players, Dan considers himself only a part-time player due to the fact that he spends a large amount of his time on his business interests. He usually only plays a few events at the World Series of Poker each year and plays in occasional World Poker Tour events and a few other tournaments.

==Poker career==
Harrington first cashed in the World Series of Poker in 1986. The next year, in only his second WSOP cash, Harrington made the final table of the Main Event; he finished in sixth place in the event, which was won by Johnny Chan. Harrington&#x27;s friend and fellow Mayfair Club member, Howard Lederer was also at this final table, finishing fifth.

Sporting his iconic green Boston Red Sox cap, Dan Harrington is known as a crafty, tight-aggressive player, employing starting hand standards that are stricter than most professionals. When he reached the final table at the 1995 Main Event, he set the runner-up, Howard Goldfarb, to bluff for all his chips in the final hand. At the time of his Main event victory, Harrington lived in Downey, California. He won $1,000,000 for his victory.

Also, in 1995, he won a bracelet in the $2,500 No-Limit Hold&#x27;em event for $249,000 and the Seven-card stud event at European Poker Open in London. He made his first final table at the World Poker Tour (WPT) in 2005, winning $620,730 for his second-place finish to Minh Ly in the Doyle Brunson North American Championship.

In the early 2000s, he appeared on an obscure show called “Cash Poker”, where he played a session of $100/$200 No Limit Hold’em.

In 2007, he won the WPT Legends of Poker for a prize of $1,634,865.

In 2008, Harrington made his first appearance on the NBC show &quot;Poker After Dark&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Mayfair Club.&quot; This tournament brought together poker players who had played at the legendary Mayfair Club in New York City. The other players in the tournament with Harrington included professional poker players Lederer, Mickey Appleman, Steve Zolotow, Jay Heimowitz, and Mike Shictman, the owner of the Mayfair Club for many years. Harrington busted out first, finishing in sixth place. The tournament was won by Heimowitz, who defeated Lederer in heads-up play.

His solid play allows him to make it to many final tables at large events. He won the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event in 1995 for $1,000,000. He has made three other Main Event final tables: placing sixth in 1987 for $43,750, third (out of 839 players) in 2003 for $650,000, and fourth (out of 2,576 players) in 2004 for $1,500,000. Because of the increased number of participants, his run of back-to-back Main Event final tables in 2003-04 has been called the greatest accomplishment in World Series history, particularly by ESPN poker announcer Norman Chad. This feat was later matched by Mark Newhouse in 2013 and 2014. As defending champion in 1996, Harrington made another deep run in the Main Event, finishing in 17th place and earning $23,400. He cashed in the 2009 Main Event, finishing in 252nd place for a $32,963 payout.

Harrington, Doyle Brunson, Carlos Mortensen, Scotty Nguyen, Joe Hachem and Ryan Riess are the only six people to have won the World Series of Poker Main Event and a World Poker Tour title.

As of 2014, his live tournament winnings exceed $6,600,000, which he accumulated over a period of 34 years, cashing in 52 events. More than half of his live tournament winnings ($3,524,476) have come at the WSOP.

In 2010 Harrington was inducted in to the World Series of Poker Hall of Fame.

==Books==
He has written (co-authored with Bill Robertie) three popular books on tournament poker, two books on cash no-limit games and one book on online cash no-limit games, all published by Two Plus Two Publishing:
* &quot;Harrington on Hold&#x27;em: Volume I: Strategic Play&quot; (2004)
* &quot;Harrington on Hold&#x27;em: Volume II: The Endgame&quot; (2005)

<text>Diane Ethel McGifford (born March 26, 1945) is a former Manitoba politician, and was a member of cabinet under Premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger.

McGifford was born in Manchester, England, and moved to Manitoba at a young age. She was educated at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1970, a Master of Arts degree in 1974, and a Ph.D. in English in 1979. She subsequently worked as a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, the University of Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg, and has served as a director of the Fort Garry Women&#x27;s Resource Centre and Kali-Shiva AIDS Services. McGifford has edited &quot;Shakti&#x27;s Words: An Anthology of South Asian Canadian Women&#x27;s Poetry&quot; and &quot;The Geography of Voice: Canadian Literature of the South Asian Diaspora&quot;.

McGifford was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent Liberal Norma McCormick by almost one thousand votes in the central Winnipeg riding of Osborne. She was easily re-elected in the 1999 election in the redistributed riding of Lord Roberts.

The New Democratic Party won the election of 1999, and McGifford was appointed to Premier Gary Doer&#x27;s first cabinet as Minister of Culture, Heritage and Tourism on October 5, 1999.

On January 17, 2001, she was transferred to the Ministry of Advanced Education and Training. On her initial appointment to cabinet, she was also given responsibility for the Status of Women and Seniors, and the administration of the Manitoba Lotteries Corporation Act. She was relieved of the last responsibility on September 25, 2002, and of the first two on November 4, 2003.

In 2003, McGifford supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

McGifford was easily re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, and again in the 2007 provincial election. She was replaced as Minister of Advanced Education and Literacy by Southdale MLA Erin Selby, in a brief ceremony in March 2011. McGifford did not stand for election in the 2011 Manitoba general election.

<doc id="950429" wikidata="Q1500112" url="?curid=950429" title="Swimming Pool (2003 film)">
<text>Swimming Pool is a 2003 erotic thriller film co-written and directed by François Ozon and starring Charlotte Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier. The plot focuses on a British crime novelist, Sarah Morton (Rampling), who travels to her publisher&#x27;s upmarket summer house in Southern France to seek solitude in order to work on her next book. However, the arrival of Julie (Sagnier), who claims to be the publisher&#x27;s daughter, induces complications and a subsequent crime. Both lead characters are bilingual, and the film&#x27;s dialogue is a mixture of French and English.

&quot;Swimming Pool&quot; premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2003, and was released theatrically in France three days later with a U cinema rating, meaning it was deemed suitable for all ages. It was given a limited theatrical release in the United States that July and was edited to avoid an NC-17 rating due to its sexual content and nudity. It was subsequently released in North America on DVD in an unrated cut.

The film ignited controversy with audiences because of its ambiguous nature and unclear conclusion which can be interpreted in various ways. In France many comparisons were made with Jacques Deray&#x27;s 1969 film &quot;La Piscine&quot; (&quot;The Swimming Pool&quot;), starring Romy Schneider and Alain Delon.

== Plot ==
Sarah Morton, a middle-aged English mystery author based in London, who has written a successful series of detective novels, is experiencing writer&#x27;s block that is impeding her next book. Her publisher, John Bosload, offers her his country house near Lacoste, France, for some rest and relaxation. Sarah takes him up on the offer, hinting that she hopes John may visit. After settling into the spacious, sun-filled house and meeting the groundskeeper, Marcel, Sarah finds her quietude disrupted by a young woman claiming to be John&#x27;s daughter, Julie. She arrives late one night explaining that she is taking time off from work herself. She eventually tells Sarah that her mother used to be John&#x27;s mistress, but that he would not leave his family.

Julie&#x27;s sex life consists of one-night stands with various men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women. At first, Sarah regards Julie as a distraction from her writing. She uses earplugs to sleep during Julie&#x27;s noisy sexual encounters, but develops a voyeuristic fascination with them, abandoning the earplugs during one of Julie&#x27;s trysts. Sarah sneaks into Julie&#x27;s room and steals her diary, using it in the novel she is working on. The competition comes to the fore when a local waiter, Franck, is involved. Julie is attracted to him, but he appears to prefer the more mature Sarah, having struck up a relationship with her during her frequent lunches at the bistro.

An unexpected tragedy occurs after a night of flirting among the three. After swimming together in the pool, Franck refuses to allow Julie to continue performing oral sex on him once Sarah, who is watching them from the balcony, throws a rock into the water. Franck tells Julie he is leaving. The next day, Franck is missing. While investigating Franck&#x27;s disappearance, Sarah is told that Julie&#x27;s mother died years earlier, though Julie had spoken of her mother as if she were alive. She returns to the villa, where a confused Julie thinks Sarah is her mother and has a breakdown. Julie eventually recovers and confesses that Franck is dead after she repeatedly hit him over the head with a rock as he tried to leave her at the pool. His body is in one of the sheds.

When Marcel becomes suspicious of the mound of fresh soil where Sarah and Julie have buried Franck&#x27;s body, Sarah seduces him to distract him. Julie leaves, thanking Sarah for her help and leaving her the manuscript of an unpublished novel she claims her mother wrote, which she had previously said John made her mother burn. Sarah uses the mother&#x27;s manuscript in her novel.

Sarah returns to London and visits John at his publishing office with her new novel, titled &quot;Swimming Pool&quot;, which she anticipated he would reject, so she had it printed by another publisher. His daughter, Julia, arrives just as Sarah is leaving, but is revealed to be a different person than the girl who came to John&#x27;s house in France.

== Cast ==
== Ending interpretations ==
The intentionally ambiguous ending sparked much confusion and controversy. One interpretation is that Sarah was alone at the villa the entire time. This would mean that Julie is a fiction conjured by Sarah for the purpose of her new book – also titled &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; – which she presents defiantly to Bosload at the end of the film. Ozon has said:

On the DVD release there are 12 minutes of deleted scenes which run into each other, with shots of Sarah walking around, visiting landmarks, writing, and so forth. Julie is nowhere to be seen in the footage, and perhaps the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; can be seen as a short documentary of &quot;what actually happened.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Swimming Pool&quot; grossed $10.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $12.3 million in other territories (including $4 million in France), for a worldwide total of $22.4 million, against a budget of €6.1 million (roughly US$7.8 million).

=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;A sensual thriller with two engaging performers demanding our undivided attention.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;generally favourable&quot; reviews.

Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;François Ozon, the director and co-writer (with Emmanuèle Bernheim), understands as Hitchcock did the small steps by which a wrong decision grows in its wrongness into a terrifying paranoid nightmare&quot;.

Neil Smith of the BBC also praised the film, calling it a &quot;compelling psychological melodrama&quot; and &quot;Hitchcockian thriller&quot;. Sarmad Iqbal of the International Policy Digest wrote that the film&#x27;s &quot;intriguing yet mystifying mix of erotica and thriller set in a part of France that is a far cry from bustling Paris makes you fall in love with it. It is not just the plot, the setting and the way actors have immaculately performed their roles will make you shower praise on this film but also the soundtrack by Philippe Rombi&quot;.

Moira Macdonald of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called film&#x27;s director a &quot;master of mood&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot;″s David Rooney called the film a &quot;sophisticated [and] unpredictable mystery&quot;.

<doc id="950430" wikidata="Q576038" url="?curid=950430" title="PZL M-15 Belphegor">
<text>The PZL M-15 was a jet-powered sesquiplane designed and manufactured by the Polish aircraft company WSK PZL-Mielec for agricultural aviation. In reference to both its strange looks and relatively loud jet engine, the aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Belphegor&quot;, after the noisy demon.

Development of the M-15 can be traced back to a Soviet requirement for a modern agricultural aircraft to succeed the Antonov An-2; it was at the insistence of Soviet officials that jet propulsion would power the type. WSK Mielec&#x27;s design team recognised the value of the An-2&#x27;s biplane configuration to the role and set about developing an initial experimental aircraft, the Lala-1, for (&quot;Flying Laboratory 1&quot;) to explore the use of a jet engine with such a configuration. On 20 May 1973, the first M-15 prototype performed its maiden flight; even during the test flight phase, it was apparent that there were several drawbacks to the aircraft, including its poor handling, limited range, and high operating costs. While production commenced in 1976, these problems remained unresolved and meant that the M-15 was noticeably inferior in several respects to the An-2. During 1981, production was terminated in favour of procuring more An-2s; a total of 175 M-15s were built against the many thousands which had once been planned.

==Development==
===Origins===
By 1970, the Soviet Union was formulating a new requirement for an agricultural aircraft that it intended to use above the very large areas of Soviet farms, the kolkhoz collectives, and state-owned sovkhoz. It was explicitly stated in the requirement that the envisioned aircraft was to be both more efficient and modern than the existing Antonov An-2SKh and An-2R, of which tens of thousands had been produced primarily to perform this role. During 1971, following an agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland on the matter, the Polish aircraft manufacturer WSK Mielec set about developing its own original response to the requirement. By this point, Poland had already produced the agricultural Antonov An-2R under licence for export back to the USSR, while agricultural planes had become a Polish specialization within the Comecon.

WSK Mielec&#x27;s design team was headed by two engineers, Kazimierz Gocyła and Riamir Izmailov. The designers recognised that it would be highly desirable to retain many of the characteristics of the successful An-2, while also improving upon them where feasible. As such, there was a reported desire to incorporate state-of-the-art technologies and to make the aircraft into a symbol of the rapid progress of development. According to aviation author Krzysztof Luto, the highly unusual decision to adopt jet engine propulsion for the prospective aircraft had been at the insistence of Soviet officials, who also actively participated in the design process. Accordingly, the design team were compelled to use such an engine due to political factors rather than practical ones. Recognising the favourable qualities of the An-2, it was decided to adopt some similar design features, such as its biplane configuration that gave favourable lift characteristics.

===Flight testing===
It was recognised from the onset that use of a jet engine for a relatively slow agricultural biplane posed several problems that would need to be addressed, including unforgiving handling and maintenance issues. In order to better explore these problems, an experimental airplane &quot;Lala-1&quot;, for (&quot;Flying Laboratory 1&quot;), was constructed in Poland. Performing its first flight on 10 February 1972, this aircraft comprised the whole forward section of an An-2, together with its wings, while the rear part was cut off and replaced with a frame construction that housed a single Ivchenko-Progress AI-25 turbofan engine (as used on the tri-engined Yakovlev Yak-40 and the single-engined Aero L-39 Albatros fighter-trainer). The Lala-1 was equipped with agricultural devices; experiences and data gathered from its test flights greatly influenced the design of the M-15.

On 30 May 1973, the first variant of the M-15 conducted its maiden flight; it was followed by the second prototype on 9 January 1974. During the following years, both aircraft were intensively tested, and were joined by a pre-production series. Even at this stage of the project, the aircraft&#x27;s performance was being criticised and constantly compared unfavourably with its An-2 predecessor. The M-15 was publicly displayed at the Paris Air Show of 1976; it has been claimed that it was at this event that the aircraft received its popular nickname of &quot;Belphegor&quot;, a result of its strange appearance and noisy jet engine propulsion.

===Production===
During 1976, serial production of the M-15 commenced. At one stage, Soviet agriculture planners had intended to order as many as 3,000 aircraft to meet its needs; however, operations of the M-15 under real world circumstances proved to be a largely disappointing experience. As an inherent consequence of adopting a jet engine, it was not an economical aircraft to operate, being inferior in this aspect to the An-2 that the M-15 had been envisioned to succeed. In contrast, the M-15 could only achieve a range of 215 nautical miles, half that of the An-2, largely due to its jet engine and relatively high weight. Maintenance was also more intensive, a factor which was compounded by the typically austere nature of agricultural airstrips. The aircraft was also expensive, both to construct and to operate. Furthermore, pilots would commonly need additional training for handling jet-powered aircraft, which was a further complication for any transition to the M-15.

Production of the aircraft was terminated without ceremony during 1981, by which point only 175 aircraft had been completed. The M-15 was only ever operated inside the USSR, despite the type having been made available to potential export customers. Taking its envisioned role was the preexisting An-2, which continued to be used in the agricultural role into the twenty-first century. Of those M-15s that were produced, very few remained operational by 1995, its operators having rarely found the aircraft to be satisfactory. It is believed that the M-15 is the world&#x27;s only jet agricultural aircraft (i.e., the world&#x27;s only jet cropduster), as well as the world&#x27;s only jet biplane and the world&#x27;s slowest jet aircraft, at least amongst aircraft that have been put in mass production.

==Design==

The PZL M-15 Belphegor was a metal twin-boom sesquiplane. It was intended to be routinely operated by a single pilot, but also had provisions for two additional crew to serve as technicians when deemed necessary. Portions of the lower wings and the chemicals tanks were composed of a laminate to avoid corrosion. The upper and lower wings were connected with two thick columns which housed the chemical tanks. It was outfitted with a fixed tricycle landing gear arrangement. The M-15 was a relatively heavy aircraft, and has been described as being the heaviest biplane to ever be produced.

For the crop-dusting mission, the M-15 could accommodate a payload of just under three tons of pesticides within two sizable pylons that separated its two wings; chemical dispersal was achieved via compressed air. This storage system was relatively unorthodox, the conventional An-2 simply stored these in a single tank housed within the fuselage in a space that could be reused for various other cargoes if not fitted. As such, the arrangement adopted upon the M-15 allowed for no such flexibility and severely limited alternative uses for the aircraft. To avoid the engine exhaust interfering with the dispersal system during release, the engine had to be positioned in a relatively elevated location on top of the fuselage; this was also beneficial to minimise the engine&#x27;s ingestion of debris, which was a particular problem when operating from austere airstrips.

<text>Michael Green (born 2 January 1927 in Leicester, England, died 25 February 2018) was a British journalist and author of humorous books. He is best known for &quot;The Art of Coarse Rugby&quot;, &quot;The Art of Coarse Acting&quot; and other books with similar titles.

==Career==
Green began his career as a junior journalist on the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;. He later joined the &quot;Northampton Chronicle and Echo&quot;, where he worked on both the sporting and theatrical fronts, then the &quot;Birmingham Gazette&quot; as a sub-editor. Later he was a sports writer on &quot;The Observer&quot; and a contributor to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, among others.

&quot;The Art of Coarse Rugby&quot;, which became a best-seller in 1960, and &quot;The Art of Coarse Acting&quot; were both products of his Midlands days, when he was involved with amateur rugby and dramatics. Green was commissioned to write &quot;The Art of Coarse Rugby&quot; by Hutchinson, to go with a republication of &quot;The Art of Coarse Cricket&quot; by Spike Hughes, who had intended the title as a play on &quot;Coarse Fishing&quot;. Green describes a coarse actor as &quot;one who can remember his lines, but not the order in which they come. One who performs ... amid lethal props...&quot; and goes on: &quot;The Coarse Actor&#x27;s aim is to upstage the rest of the cast. His hope is to be dead by Act Two so that he can spend the rest of his time in the bar. His problems? Everyone else connected with the production.&quot; In similar vein, the coarse rugby player is described as differentiated from the rugger player in that he does not enjoy playing, but instead plays for any one of a number of other reasons, such as to get away from his wife, or because he dare not admit he is too old. Other books in the series followed, and &quot;The Art of Coarse Moving&quot; subsequently became the 1977 BBC TV series &quot;A Roof over My Head&quot; with Brian Rix.

His book about journalism, &quot;Don&#x27;t Print My Name Upside Down&quot;, was based largely on his Northampton days. Stanley Worker, the paper&#x27;s long-serving chief sub-editor, was so proud of references to him in the book that he kept a copy in his desk drawer to peruse with quiet satisfaction during rare lulls in his working day. Green also published two autobiographical books: &quot;The Boy Who Shot Down an Airship&quot;, which includes reminiscences about his National Service experiences, and &quot;Nobody Hurt in Small Earthquake&quot;, about his postwar journalist and sub-editor experiences in Northampton, Birmingham and London.

He also created and wrote the character of Squire Haggard for a newspaper column written by Peter Simple, subsequently a novel and the &quot;Haggard&quot; TV series 1990–92 on ITV. He created three Coarse Acting Shows, two of which were performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1977 and 1979; these are essentially a series of sketches about bad acting. &quot;Tonight Josephine&quot; is a book of amusing imaginary letters written by historical figures.

Green was famous for his zany and slightly eccentric behaviour. Members of the Masque Theatre in Northampton were able to recall Green&#x27;s antics in minute detail many years (decades?) after his departure, and the &quot;Northampton Chronicle&quot; office was awash with Green stories, all on the theme of good intentions leading to all-round chaos. At the &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; he was firewatching one night with Maurice Barsby. Maurice said when looking at the huge printing presses in the basement &quot;I know how these things work …” Michael said &quot;Go on, then&quot;. He pulled the main switches and Maurice pressed the button. The press started but not gradually, and the enormous reel of paper broke and spewed into the machine-room. So there was no midnight edition of the Mercury, and as the presses did not stop when the button was pressed they had to switch off at the mains. Next day Michael was questioned and then sacked, but not Maurice. Green admits that he &quot;had a reputation for playing the fool.&quot; The overnight firewatching job was unpopular, except with lads of 16 or 17 who were too young to be called up; they could drink brown ale, use the typewriters and telephones and smoke the editor&#x27;s cigars (leaving burns in the carpet).

<text>Dallah Avco is an aviation-services company founded in 1975 with extensive contracts with the Saudi Ministry of Defense and Aviation.

==Profile==
As of 2013, Dallah Avco was one of seven Saudi-based airline companies. A sister concern of Dallah Avco also conducts construction and maintenance contracts in the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Both are subsidiaries of Dallah Al-Baraka Group owned by Sheikh Saleh Abdullah Kamel.

==Fleet==
The Dallah Avco fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of August 2017):
== Possible connection to 9/11 Attacks ==
Dallah Avco is described in redacted documents released by the FBI in September 2021 as having had approximately fifty &quot;ghost employees&quot;, all of whom were paid by the company and yet did not show up to work. Among these employees was Omar al-Bayoumi, a known associate of 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. Bayoumi was reportedly paid a stipend of US$3,000 per month by Dallah Avco, although the company has claimed he was actually an employee of the Saudi government. Dallah Avco is one of 10 defendants in a $4.2 billion lawsuit over the attacks which the Supreme Court allowed to proceed in 2014, and whose quest for answers the United States Congress supported in 2016 by passing the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. As of April 2023, the case was still being actively litigated.

<text>Edward Michael Bankes Green (20 August 1930 – 6 February 2019) was a British theologian, Anglican priest, Christian apologist and author of more than 50 books.

== Early life, education and ministry ==
Green&#x27;s mother was Australian and his father was Welsh. He became a committed Christian through the Iwerne camps ministry of E. J. H. Nash (known as &quot;Bash&quot;). He was educated at Clifton College and Exeter College, Oxford (Bachelor of Arts 1953, Master of Arts 1956) and subsequently at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge (Bachelor of Arts 1957, Master of Arts 1961, Bachelor of Divinity 1966) while preparing for ordained ministry at Ridley Hall. He was admitted to the degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury (1996) and the University of Toronto (1992). He was ordained deacon in 1957 and priest in 1958.

Green was an assistant curate of Holy Trinity, Eastbourne (1957–60), a tutor at the London College of Divinity (1960–69), Principal of St John&#x27;s College, Nottingham (1969–75) and Rector of St Aldate&#x27;s Church, Oxford and chaplain of the Oxford Pastorate (1975–86). He had additionally been an honorary canon of Coventry Cathedral from 1970 to 1978. He then moved to Canada where he was Professor of Evangelism at Regent College, Vancouver from 1987 to 1992. He returned to England to take up the position of advisor to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York for the Springboard Decade of Evangelism. In 1993 he was appointed one of the Six Preachers of Canterbury Cathedral. Despite having officially retired in 1996, he became a Senior Research Fellow and Head of Evangelism and Apologetics at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford in 1997. He lived in the town of Abingdon near Oxford.

Green was married to Rosemary for 61 years, and they had four children: Tim, Sarah, Jenny, and Jonathan.

== Apologetics and evangelism ==
Green was a prolific writer, with much of his work written for a popular reading audience, although he also contributed to academic studies. Many of his best known books discuss the twin topics of evangelism and apologetics.

One of Green&#x27;s objectives was to equip lay Christian believers in their grasp of the gospel message and to then have confidence to converse with others about faith matters. These practical objectives are clear in books such as &quot;Evangelism, Now and Then&quot; and &quot;Sharing Your Faith With Friends and Family&quot;. At a technical level Green contributed an academic study of the praxis and theory of evangelism in &quot;Evangelism in the Early Church&quot;. This work explores the development of evangelism through the New Testament texts and from the early Church Fathers. He built on those foundational studies in his advocacy of evangelism at a parish church level, both through his personal ministry and in his book &quot;Evangelism Through the Local Church&quot;.

Green&#x27;s apologetic work generally focussed on popular misconceptions and objections held by non-Christians. In books such as &quot;You Must Be Joking&quot;, &quot;World on the Run&quot; and &quot;Why Bother With Jesus&quot;, he dealt with attitudes of religious indifference and scepticism. He also addressed a variety of objections concerning religious hypocrisy and religious pluralism as well as popular questions of doubt and unbelief. He also examined the evidences for the life, death and resurrection of Christ in &quot;Man Alive&quot; and again in the revision of that book, &quot;The Day Death Died&quot;.

Green also explored academic challenges to faith, such as in the collection of essays he prepared as a reply to Don Cupitt&#x27;s work on &quot;The Myth of God Incarnate&quot;, which were published less than six months later under the title &quot;The Truth of God Incarnate&quot;. In that analysis Green and his colleagues addressed the problems of myth and history as propounded in modern biblical scholarship, especially concerning the relationship between the events of Jesus&#x27; ministry and teaching and the doctrine of the Incarnation.

One of Green&#x27;s more recent works, &quot;The Books the Church Suppressed: Fiction and Truth in The Da Vinci Code&quot;, is an argument for orthodox Christianity against Gnosticism as presented in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Green here linked Gnosticism with a decline in society. He also claimed that Gnosticism leads to a decline in morality, so that by ordaining a homosexual bishop the Episcopal Church of the United States has itself shown Gnostic tendencies. He considered aspects of apologetic methodology and strategy in his co-authored work with Alister McGrath.

Aside from his apologetic writings, Green also addressed issues of discipleship in the Christian life, ministry and leadership in the church, the doctrine of baptism, pneumatology (study of the Holy Spirit) and demonology. He also wrote non-technical commentaries on certain books of the New Testament. In &quot;2 Peter Reconsidered&quot; he provided a solid exegesis and defended the authenticity of the book; through his interpretation he also showed his Arminianism.

Green led a mission to Winchester College in the 1970s, which was followed by the rapid growth of the school&#x27;s &quot;Christian Forum&quot;, an evangelical group which by 1977 numbered around 100 schoolboys, a sixth of the school&#x27;s total number. The barrister John Smyth regularly attended and addressed the group; according to the Makin Review, published in 2024, Green was told in 1982 by a curate at Winchester College about Smyth&#x27;s serial sadomasochistic abuse of boys at the school but, in Green&#x27;s words, was &quot;sworn to secrecy&quot; (section 12.1.10 (s)). 

&quot;Adventure of Faith&quot; is his spiritual autobiography.

<doc id="950442" wikidata="Q3577326" url="?curid=950442" title="Ébauche">
<text>(loanword from French, meaning blank, outline or sketch) is a preliminary underpainting or quick sketch in oils for an oil painting. Horology, clockmaking and watchmaking appropriated the term ébauche to refer to an incomplete or unassembled watch movement and its associated components. The French term is regularly used by English-speaking artists and art historians, as well as horologists and hobbyists.

==Art==
One early criticism of Impressionist painting was that its practitioners sought to elevate the status of the ébauche to the level of finished painting.

==Horology==
Until about 1850, the watchmaker’s ébauche consisted of two plates with pillars and bars, the barrel, fusée, index, pawl and ratchet-wheel, along with a few assembling screws. These parts were all roughly filed and milled. The steel and brass were manufactured in a special workshop. The ébauche was finished by watchmakers in a finishing shop. The (literally &quot;assortment&quot; in English) are the parts of a watch other than the ébauche, in particular the regulating organs and include the balance, hairspring or spiral, escape wheel, anchor lever and pallet stones or jewels. The modern ébauche is a jewelled watch movement, without its regulating organs, mainspring, dial, or hands.

During the Industrial Revolution, new components were introduced by the Waltham Watch Company and the development of the American System of Watch Manufacturing, establishing the base of modern watch manufacture. Historic producers of ébauche movements have included companies such as A. Schild, Peseux, Fabrique d&#x27;Horlogerie de Fontainemelon (FHF), Gallet &amp; Cie Fabrique d’horlogerie Electa, Landeron, Valjoux, Venus, France Ébauches and Lemania. Many of these producers have gone out of business over the past few decades, succumbing to the Quartz Revolution. Most were unable to compete with the inexpensive quartz electronic movements produced by Asian manufacturers, which flooded the market during the 1980s. The remaining ébauche producers today are almost all owned by ETA, a subsidiary of the Swatch Group.

<text>Error correction mode (ECM) is an optional transmission mode built into Class 1/2/2.0 fax machines or fax modems. ECM automatically detects and corrects errors in the fax transmission process that are sometimes caused by telephone line noise. 

The page data is divided into what is known as Octets (small blocks of data). Once the receiver has received all the Octets it examines them (using check-sums) and then advises the transmitting fax of any Octets that are in error. The transmitter then need only resend the blocks in error rather than the whole page. This generally means an ECM coded fax will be more likely to succeed in transmitting a copy of the page(s) on a noisy line. ECM is the norm rather than the exception. Some fax machines have the capability to enable or disable this function.</text><links>

<text>Tiwai Point lies at the entrance to Bluff Harbour on the southern coast of the South Island of New Zealand. A spit which extends from the western end of the Awarua Plain, it lies between Awarua Bay to the north and Foveaux Strait to the south. It is known for the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter, one of the largest industrial facilities in New Zealand.

==Demographics==
Tiwai Point is part of the Woodend-Greenhills statistical area.

==Tiwai Rocks Important Bird Area==
The rocks at the tip of Tiwai Point have been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because they are home to a breeding colony of Foveaux shags.

== Foveaux looper moth ==
Tiwai Point is one of the two remaining locations where the critically endangered Foveaux looper moth lives. &quot;A. frivola&quot; is at high risk of extinction, and has already disappeared from one of its three known localities. Its main population exists on an area at Tiwai Point of less than 25 m2 of coastal vegetation.

== Causeway accident ==
In 1980, a vehicle with 10 people failed to take a turn on the Tiwai Point causeway, crashing through a barrier and falling into the water. Seven people died, including five who were never recovered.

<text>An electric fish is any fish that can generate electric fields, whether to sense things around them, for defence, or to stun prey. Most fish able to produce shocks are also electroreceptive, meaning that they can sense electric fields. The only exception is the stargazer family (Uranoscopidae). Electric fish, although a small minority of all fishes, include both oceanic and freshwater species, and both cartilaginous and bony fishes. 

Electric fish produce their electrical fields from an electric organ. This is made up of electrocytes, modified muscle or nerve cells, specialized for producing strong electric fields, used to locate prey, for defence against predators, and for signalling, such as in courtship. Electric organ discharges are two types, pulse and wave, and vary both by species and by function.

Electric fish have evolved many specialised behaviours. The predatory African sharptooth catfish eavesdrops on its weakly electric mormyrid prey to locate it when hunting, driving the prey fish to develop electric signals that are harder to detect. Bluntnose knifefishes produce an electric discharge pattern similar to the electrolocation pattern of the dangerous electric eel, probably a form of Batesian mimicry to dissuade predators. Glass knifefish that are using similar frequencies move their frequencies up or down in a jamming avoidance response; African knifefish have convergently evolved a nearly identical mechanism.

== Evolution and phylogeny ==
All fish, indeed all vertebrates, use electrical signals in their nerves and muscles. Cartilaginous fishes and some other basal groups use passive electrolocation with sensors that detect electric fields; the platypus and echidna have separately evolved this ability. The knifefishes and elephantfishes actively electrolocate, generating weak electric fields to find prey. Finally, fish in several groups have the ability to deliver electric shocks powerful enough to stun their prey or repel predators. Among these, only the stargazers, a group of marine bony fish, do not also use electrolocation. 

In vertebrates, electroreception is an ancestral trait, meaning that it was present in their last common ancestor. This form of ancestral electroreception is called ampullary electroreception, from the name of the receptive organs involved, ampullae of Lorenzini. These evolved from the mechanical sensors of the lateral line, and exist in cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), lungfishes, bichirs, coelacanths, sturgeons, paddlefish, aquatic salamanders, and caecilians. Ampullae of Lorenzini were lost early in the evolution of bony fishes and tetrapods. Where electroreception does occur in these groups, it has secondarily been acquired in evolution, using organs other than and not homologous with ampullae of Lorenzini. Most common bony fish are non-electric. There are some 350 species of electric fish.

Electric organs have evolved eight times, four of these being organs powerful enough to deliver an electric shock. Each such group is a clade. Most electric organs evolved from myogenic tissue (which forms muscle), however, one group of Gymnotiformes, the Apteronotidae, derived their electric organ from neurogenic tissue (which forms nerves). In &quot;Gymnarchus niloticus&quot; (the African knifefish), the tail, trunk, hypobranchial, and eye muscles are incorporated into the organ, most likely to provide rigid fixation for the electrodes while swimming. In some other species, the tail fin is lost or reduced. This may reduce lateral bending while swimming, allowing the electric field to remain stable for electrolocation. There has been convergent evolution in these features among the mormyrids and gymnotids. Electric fish species that live in habitats with few obstructions, such as some bottom-living fish, display these features less prominently. This implies that convergence for electrolocation is indeed what has driven the evolution of the electric organs in the two groups.

Actively electrolocating fish are marked on the phylogenetic tree with a small yellow lightning flash . Fish able to deliver electric shocks are marked with a red lightning flash . Non-electric and purely passively electrolocating species are not shown.

== Weakly electric fish ==

Weakly electric fish generate a discharge that is typically less than one volt. These are too weak to stun prey and instead are used for navigation, electrolocation in conjunction with electroreceptors in their skin, and electrocommunication with other electric fish. The major groups of weakly electric fish are the Osteoglossiformes, which include the Mormyridae (elephantfishes) and the African knifefish &quot;Gymnarchus&quot;, and the Gymnotiformes (South American knifefishes). These two groups have evolved convergently, with similar behaviour and abilities but different types of electroreceptors and differently sited electric organs.

== Strongly electric fish ==


Strongly electric fish, namely the electric eels, the electric catfishes, the electric rays, and the stargazers, have an electric organ discharge powerful enough to stun prey or be used for defence, and navigation. The electric eel, even when very small in size, can deliver substantial electric power, and enough current to exceed many species&#x27; pain threshold. Electric eels sometimes leap out of the water to electrify possible predators directly, as has been tested with a human arm.

The amplitude of the electrical output from these fish can range from 10 to 860 volts with a current of up to 1 ampere, according to the surroundings, for example different conductances of salt and freshwater. To maximize the power delivered to the surroundings, the impedances of the electric organ and the water must be matched:

* Strongly electric marine fish give low voltage, high current electric discharges. In salt water, a small voltage can drive a large current limited by the internal resistance of the electric organ. Hence, the electric organ consists of many electrocytes in parallel. 
* Freshwater fish have high voltage, low current discharges. In freshwater, the power is limited by the voltage needed to drive the current through the large resistance of the medium. Hence, these fish have numerous cells in series.

== Electric organ == 
=== Anatomy ===

Electric organs vary widely among electric fish groups. They evolved from excitable, electrically active tissues that make use of action potentials for their function: most derive from muscle tissue, but in some groups the organ derives from nerve tissue. The organ may lie along the body&#x27;s axis, as in the electric eel and &quot;Gymnarchus&quot;; it may be in the tail, as in the elephantfishes; or it may be in the head, as in the electric rays and the stargazers.

=== Physiology ===

Electric organs are made up of electrocytes, large, flat cells that create and store electrical energy, awaiting discharge. The anterior ends of these cells react to stimuli from the nervous system and contain sodium channels. The posterior ends contain sodium–potassium pumps. Electrocytes become polar when triggered by a signal from the nervous system. Neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine; this triggers acetylcholine receptors to open and sodium ions to flow into the electrocytes. The influx of positively charged sodium ions causes the cell membrane to depolarize slightly. This in turn causes the gated sodium channels at the anterior end of the cell to open, and a flood of sodium ions enters the cell. Consequently, the anterior end of the electrocyte becomes highly positive, while the posterior end, which continues to pump out sodium ions, remains negative. This sets up a potential difference (a voltage) between the ends of the cell. After the voltage is released, the cell membranes go back to their resting potentials until they are triggered again.

=== Discharge patterns ===

Electric organ discharges (EODs) need to vary with time for electrolocation, whether with pulses, as in the Mormyridae, or with waves, as in the Torpediniformes and &quot;Gymnarchus&quot;, the African knifefish. Many electric fishes also use EODs for communication, while strongly electric species use them for hunting or defence. Their electric signals are often simple and stereotyped, the same on every occasion.

== Electrocommunication ==

Weakly electric fish can communicate by modulating the electrical waveform they generate. They may use this to attract mates and in territorial displays.

=== Sexual behaviour ===

In sexually dimorphic signalling, as in the brown ghost knifefish (&quot;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&quot;), the electric organ produces distinct signals to be received by individuals of the same or other species. The electric organ fires to produce a discharge with a certain frequency, along with short modulations termed &quot;chirps&quot; and &quot;gradual frequency rises&quot;, both varying widely between species and differing between the sexes. For example, in the glass knifefish genus &quot;Eigenmannia&quot;, females produce a nearly pure sine wave with few harmonics, males produce a far sharper non-sinusoidal waveform with strong harmonics.

Male bluntnose knifefishes (&quot;Brachyhypopomus&quot;) produce a continuous electric &quot;hum&quot; to attract females; this consumes 11–22% of their total energy budget, whereas female electrocommunication consumes only 3%. Large males produced signals of larger amplitude, and these are preferred by the females. The cost to males is reduced by a circadian rhythm, with more activity coinciding with night-time courtship and spawning, and less at other times.

=== Antipredator behaviour ===

Electric catfish (Malapteruridae) frequently use their electric discharges to ward off other species from their shelter sites, whereas with their own species they have ritualized fights with open-mouth displays and sometimes bites, but rarely use electric organ discharges.

The electric discharge pattern of bluntnose knifefishes is similar to the low voltage electrolocative discharge of the electric eel. This is thought to be a form of bluffing Batesian mimicry of the powerfully protected electric eel.

Fish that prey on electrolocating fish may &quot;eavesdrop&quot; on the discharges of their prey to detect them. The electroreceptive African sharptooth catfish (&quot;Clarias gariepinus&quot;) may hunt the weakly electric mormyrid, &quot;Marcusenius macrolepidotus&quot; in this way. This has driven the prey, in an evolutionary arms race, to develop more complex or higher frequency signals that are harder to detect.

=== Jamming avoidance response ===

It had been theorized as early as the 1950s that electric fish near each other might experience some type of interference. In 1963, Akira Watanabe and Kimihisa Takeda discovered the jamming avoidance response in &quot;Eigenmannia&quot;. When two fish are approaching one another, their electric fields interfere. This sets up a beat with a frequency equal to the difference between the discharge frequencies of the two fish. The jamming avoidance response comes into play when fish are exposed to a slow beat. If the neighbour&#x27;s frequency is higher, the fish lowers its frequency, and vice versa. A similar jamming avoidance response was discovered in the distantly related &quot;Gymnarchus niloticus&quot;, the African knifefish, by Walter Heiligenberg in 1975, in a further example of convergent evolution between the electric fishes of Africa and South America. Both the neural computational mechanisms and the behavioural responses are nearly identical in the two groups.

<doc id="950457" wikidata="Q432682" url="?curid=950457" title="Shambhala">
<text>Shambhala (, ), also spelled &quot;Shambala&quot; or &quot;Shamballa&quot; (; ), is a spiritual kingdom in Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Shambhala is mentioned in the &quot;Kalachakra Tantra&quot;. The Bon scriptures speak of a closely related land called Tagzig Olmo Lung Ring.

The Sanskrit name is taken from the name of a city near the Ganges, sometimes identified with Sambhal in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, as mentioned in the Hindu Puranas. The mythological relevance of the place originates with a prophecy in &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; (4.24) according to which Shambhala will be the birthplace of Kalki, the next incarnation of Vishnu, who will usher in a new age (Satya Yuga); and the prophesied ruling Kingdom of Maitreya, the future Buddha.

== Kalachakra tantra==

Shambhala is ruled by the future Buddha Maitreya. The Shambhala narrative is found in the &quot;Kalachakra tantra&quot;, a text of the group of the Anuttarayoga Tantras. Kalachakra Buddhism was presumably introduced to Tibet in the 11th century, the epoch of the Tibetan Kalachakra calendar. The oldest known teachers of Kalachakra are Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (d. 1361) and Buton Rinchen Drub (d. 1364).

In the narrative, King Manjuśrīkīrti is said to have been born in 159 BC and ruled over a kingdom of 300,510 followers of the Mlechha religion, some of whom worshiped the Sun. He is said to have expelled 20,000 people from his domain who clung to Surya Samadhi (solar worship) rather than convert to Kalachakra (Wheel of Time) Buddhism. 
After realizing these were the wisest and best of his people and how much he was in need of them, he later asked them to return and some did. Those who did not return are said to have set up the city of Shambhala. Manjuśrīkīrti initiated the preaching of the &quot;Kalachakra&quot; teachings in order to try to convert those who returned and were still under his rule. In 59 BC he abdicated his throne to his son, Puṇḍārika, and died soon afterward, entering the Sambhogakaya of Buddhahood.

The Kalachakra tantra prophesies that when the world declines into war and greed, and all is lost, the 25th Kalki king Maitreya will emerge from Shambhala, with a huge army to vanquish Dark Forces and usher in a worldwide Golden Age. This final battle is prophesied for the year 2424 or 2425 (in the 3304th year after the death of the Buddha). Thereafter, Buddhism would survive another 1,800 years.

==Western reception==
Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism were largely unknown in the West prior to the beginning of the 20th century. The name itself, however, was reported as early as the 17th century, by way of Estêvão Cacella, the Portuguese missionary who had heard about Shambhala (transcribed as &quot;Xembala&quot;), and thought it was another name for Cathay or China. Cacella in 1627 headed to Tashilhunpo, the seat of the Panchen Lama and, discovering his mistake, returned to India.

===Neo-Theosophy===

Later esoteric writers further emphasized and elaborated on the concept of a hidden land inhabited by a hidden mystic brotherhood whose members labor for the good of humanity. Alice A. Bailey claims Shamballa (her spelling) is an extra-dimensional or spiritual reality on the astral plane, a spiritual centre where the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara, dwells as the highest Avatar of the Planetary Logos of Earth, and is said to be an expression of the Will of God.

===Expeditions and location hypotheses===
Nicholas and Helena Roerich led a 1924–1928 expedition aimed at Shambhala. They also believed that Belukha Mountain in the Altai Mountains was an entrance to Shambhala, a common belief in that region. They led a second expedition to look for Shambhala in Mongolia between 1934 and 1935. 

Inspired by Theosophical lore and several visiting Mongol lamas, Gleb Bokii, the chief Bolshevik cryptographer and one of the bosses of the Soviet secret police, along with his writer friend Alexander Barchenko, embarked on a quest for Shambhala, in an attempt to merge Kalachakra-tantra and ideas of Communism in the 1920s. Among other things, in a secret laboratory affiliated with the secret police, Bokii and Barchenko experimented with Buddhist spiritual techniques to try to find a key for engineering perfect communist human beings. They contemplated a special expedition to Inner Asia to retrieve the wisdom of Shambhala – the project fell through as a result of intrigues within the Soviet intelligence service, as well as rival efforts of the Soviet Foreign Commissariat that sent its own expedition to Tibet in 1924.

French Buddhist Alexandra David-Néel associated Shambhala with Balkh in present-day Afghanistan, also offering the Persian &quot;Sham-i-Bala&quot;, &quot;elevated candle&quot; as an etymology of its name. 
In a similar vein, the Gurdjieffian J. G. Bennett published speculation that Shambalha was &quot;Shams-i-Balkh&quot;, a Bactrian sun temple.

Hitler sent several expeditions to Tibet in the 1930s &quot;to contact the Agartha and Shambala&quot;, supposedly part of Nazi esotericism.

=== In popular culture ===

Shambhala may have been the inspiration for Shangri-La, a paradise on Earth hidden in a Tibetan valley, which features in the 1933 novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; by British author James Hilton.

<text>The Loyola Phoenix is the official newspaper of Loyola University Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. It is a student activity independent of the school&#x27;s journalism program. Published on a weekly basis, it not only serves the students and faculty of the various colleges of the university in the United States and Italy, but it also serves the northside Chicago neighborhoods of Edgewater and Rogers Park and has a readership that extends through the twenty-eight member institutions of the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. Past staff advisors have been affiliated with the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;.

 the faculty adviser to the newspaper is Katie Drews, a former investigative reporter at the Better Government Association and the 2008-09 editor-in-chief of The Phoenix.

==History==
Loyola&#x27;s student newspaper was founded as the Loyola News in 1924. In 1969, the university sought to take editorial control of &quot;Loyola News&quot; after the paper criticized the university&#x27;s administration and the Vietnam War. The writers and staff members responded by shutting down &quot;Loyola News&quot;, and founding &quot;The&quot; &quot;Loyola Phoenix&quot;, which initially operated as an independent business.

Following the newspaper&#x27;s coverage of an alleged violent beating of a gay man on the CTA Red Line by a then-Loyola student in January 2010, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; was subpoenaed for their notes regarding the case. Attorneys for the criminal defendant also subpoenaed the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. In the summer of 2011, however, judge Diane Cannon, blocked the subpoena, which set a new standard for student journalists, entitling them to the same protection as their professional counterparts. The ruling was the first decision in Illinois to apply the law to a student newspaper.

<text>Bessacarr () is a suburb on the south-east edge of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Consisting of mostly private residential development from the 1960s onward, it also contains some of the most expensive property in Doncaster, around St Wildfrid&#x27;s Road and Warning Tongue Lane. It is largely interwoven with Cantley to the north-east having partially signposted ancient boundaries, upon which its population was 19,803 at the 2001 census.

The Bessacarr and Cantley ward within the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster had a population of 14,408 at the 2011 census, although this includes most of Cantley and Lakeside, and does not include Bessacarr Grange.

==Localities==

===West Bessacarr===
The bulk of Bessacarr is often known as West Bessacarr and is south of Bawtry Road. A small minority of the neighbourhood was built in the 1930s or earlier, the majority of the building occurred in the 1960s and 70s. Some recent development has occurred in the late 1990s and into the 21st century. Apartments are a feature of the most recent developments.

Nostell Place includes a Doctor&#x27;s surgery, veterinary surgery, pharmacist, Co-Operative food store, bakery, hairdresser, hardware store, fish and chip shop and Chinese takeaway amongst others. Nearby is the Flying Childers public house, St Francis of Assisi Anglican Church, Bessacarr Library and Willow Primary School. Some other shops, including an off-licence and a hairdresser / beautician, are further up Alston Road around the corner from Toby Carvery. Doncaster Lawn Tennis Club is on Saxton Avenue and is accessible via a footpath from Ellers Road.

West Bessacarr is part of the cycle path from Doncaster to Rossington, known locally as &quot;the red path&quot; owing to the colour of its tarmac. Routes including the red path and others within Bessacarr can lead walkers and cyclists to the developed area known as Lakeside. Public transport to and from Bessacarr is provided by First Mainline route 59, with the direct 89 bus through the estates being withdrawn in 2004. Primary education for the area is provided by the excellent Bessacarr Primary School including its own nursery and by another called Willow Primary School, both of which feed into the local Hall Cross lower school, formally Ellers Middle School, next to the north-west boundary.
===Bessacarr Grange===
Bessacarr Grange is a largely 1990s neighbourhood south of the M18 motorway with some of its own amenities including Yorkshire Wildlife Park.

==Politics==
Bessacarr is currently the name of the ward which as such undergoes boundary and name reviews every eight to twelve years theoretically to avoid malapportionment. For the 2021 term the ward is served by a team of two local Conservative councillors and one Labour councillor.
Finningley ward would on a historic synthesis and real-politik critique of the first past the post system be considered a set of three Conservative &#x27;safe seats&#x27; and currently includes all bar the latest developed areas of Cantley as well as Bessacarr Grange.

==Demography==
Around 40% of Bessacarr is in Finningley Ward which had the following land use and housing statistics in 2011:

==Notable people==

<doc id="950466" wikidata="Q3816138" url="?curid=950466" title="Liberalism and radicalism in Spain">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in Spain. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having been represented in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties label themselves as a liberal or radical party.

==Background==
In the nineteenth century, liberalism was a major political force in Spain, but as in many other continental European countries care must be taken over the use of labels as this term was used with different meanings (this is discussed in the article on Radicalism (historical).

As in much of Europe, the nineteenth-century history of Spain would largely revolve around the conflicts &quot;between&quot; the three major liberal currents - radicalism; progressive classical liberalism, or conservative classical liberalism. While all three rejected the Catholic, traditionalist, and absolutist Old Regime, each had a different perspective on the urgency and degree to which state and society needed reforming to modernize the values and institutions.

* The term &#x27;liberal&#x27; itself was usually used to signify classical liberalism. It had a progressive-liberal wing as represented by the Fusionist Liberal Party (more inclined towards gradual reform, and making compromises with the radical current); and a conservative-liberal wing as represented by the Liberal Conservative Party (more inclined towards traditionalism, and compromising with the absolute-monarchist faction). Its various currents were broadly united by a set of shared beliefs:
*# In political affairs, parliamentarianism, though of a socially-conservative kind (e.g., suffrage limited to property-owners);
*# In economic affairs, free-market capitalism;
*# In social affairs, conservatism (e.g.: rejecting full universal suffrage; or a strictly laic separation of church and state)
*# In constitutional affairs, flexible towards the type of constitutional regime (monarchy or republic).
* For the left-liberal and social-liberal currents, &#x27;liberal&#x27; was rarely used as the single defining label. Instead such currents rather used labels such as &quot;radical&quot;, &quot;democratic&quot; or &quot;republican&quot; (see republicanism). The shared beliefs that generally unified its various factions included:
*#Universal manhood suffrage;
*# Sovereignty to be vested in the people of the nation rather than in the royal parliament;
*# A root-and-branch reform to remove the political influence of monarchical, religious and aristocratic patronage;
*# A certain degree of social democracy, as the nineteenth century progressed;
*# An active role for an administratively-centralized state in carrying out these tasks.

==History==
Each of the following sections describes an element of Spanish liberalism and radicalism, mostly beginning with the 19th century.

===From Liberals to Liberal Fusionist Party===

*1808-12: Until 1839 the Spanish liberals were not organized in a well-established party, but formed their own factions. During the War of Independence and the Constitution of Cádiz the term &quot;Liberals (Liberales, 1812-1820)&quot; was used to describe the diverse range of currents influenced by the Enlightenment and French Revolution and united in rejecting the absolutism of the Bourbon monarchy.
*1820-39: Between 1820 and 1839 the Liberals split into two factions. The &#x27;Radicals&#x27; (&quot;Exaltados&quot;), known as &quot;Veinteanistas&quot; (Supporters of 1820) were inspired by French Jacobinism and Radicalism and wished to draft a new more progressive constitution based on universal suffrage; the &#x27;Moderates&#x27; (&quot;Moderados&quot;), closer to classical liberalism, were known as &quot;Doceanistas&quot; (Supporters of 1812) as they wished simply to restore the more limited constitution of 1812.
*1839-1879: Finally in 1839 most of the Radicals and Moderates organized themselves into a loose parliamentary group known as the Progressives (&quot;Progresistas&quot;, 1839–1880), led by people like Baldomero Espartero, Salustiano Olózoga, Juan Prim, Práxedes Sagasta and Francisco Serrano y Domínguez, Duke de la Torre.

<text>Gregory Raymer (born June 25, 1964) nicknamed &quot;Fossilman,&quot; is a professional poker player and author. He is best known for winning the 2004 World Series of Poker Main Event.

==Early life==
Raymer&#x27;s family moved numerous times during his childhood, from his birthplace of Minot, North Dakota to Lansing, Michigan, where he lived until age 10. He then moved to Clearwater, Florida, attending Dunedin Middle School, and would move later once again, this time to St. Louis, Missouri.

After Raymer graduated from Parkway South High School in St. Louis, he enrolled at the University of Missouri–Rolla, where he majored in chemistry and became a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity. He graduated from the University of Minnesota with a master&#x27;s degree in biochemistry in 1989, and then again from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1992. He then practiced law as a patent attorney for more than a decade, spending the last six years of his legal career at the pharmaceutical company Pfizer.

Raymer is nicknamed &quot;Fossilman&quot; because of his fossil collecting hobby. He uses a small fossil as a card protector while he plays poker.

==Poker==
Raymer first finished in the money of a World Series of Poker (WSOP) event during 2001 in the $1,500 Omaha hi-lo split 8 or better event won by Chris Ferguson. At the 2004 World Series of Poker, he defeated David Williams to win the $5,000,000 first prize in the $10,000 no limit Texas hold &#x27;em WSOP main event.

The following year, as defending champion, Raymer finished 25th (out of 5,619 entrants) in the 2005 WSOP Main Event, earning him $304,680. Arguably, this two-year accomplishment ranks as one of the most impressive performances in the Main Event in recent history, along with Dan Harrington&#x27;s. Both players posted deep runs in consecutive years (Harrington finished 3rd and 4th in 2003/2004), and both looked to repeat as world champion within a ten-year span (Harrington won the Main Event in 1995).

In 2005, Raymer entered the inaugural British Poker Open, which was filmed in London and was the UK&#x27;s biggest live poker event in history. As one of the favorites, he made the final table and came in third in a live final, worth around £20,000.

On September 17, 2007, Raymer won his first World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) bracelet by winning Event #6 of the 2007 WCOOP, a $320 Pot Limit Omaha with Rebuys event. The victory netted him $168,362.

At the 2009 World Series of Poker $40,000 No Limit hold &#x27;em event, he placed third out of 201 entrants and won $774,927.

In 2012, he won an unprecedented four Heartland Poker Tour events. On July 30, he bested 130 opponents at the Route 66 Casino in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 1, he defeated 335 players at the River City Casino in St. Louis, on October 22, he took down another title at the Prairie Meadows Racetrack Casino In Iowa, and on November 19 he capped it off with a win at the HPT Champ Open at the Belterra Casino in Indiana. Raymer easily won the Heartland Poker Tour Player of The Year title earning a total of $371,967 in winnings.

At the 2016 World Series of Poker Main Event, he made another deep run finishing 122nd in a field of 6,737 players earning $49,108.

In 2020, he won a record fifth Heartland Poker Tour Main Event. On January 20, he bested 520 opponents at the Ameristar Casino East Chicago in East Chicago, Indiana earning him $171,411 on a $1,650 buy-in.

In October 2021, Raymer won a Platinum Pass to the PokerStars Players&#x27; Championship worth $30,000 (plus top prize of $4,911) in the $200 HORSE tournament at the inaugural Cardplayer Lifestyle Mixed Game Festival, hosted by Robbie Strazynski.

As of 2021, his total live tournament winnings exceed $8.25 million. Most of his winnings ($6,762,645) have come from his 60+ cashes at WSOP tournament events.

==Other activities==
On December 20, 2004, two men attempted to rob Raymer at gunpoint as he returned to his Bellagio hotel room after playing in a cash game. Raymer held them off by using a karate chop until police arrived and was unharmed.

Raymer has lobbied extensively to have poker regulated and classified as a game of skill, after the passage of the UIGEA in 2006. As part of this effort, he was a member of the Board of Directors of the now defunct Poker Players Alliance.

In a December 2006 interview, Raymer said that he was considering running for Vice President of the United States in 2008 as a candidate of the Libertarian Party. However, Raymer did not end up running.

<text>Chicago Union Station is an intercity and commuter rail terminal located in the West Loop neighborhood of the Near West Side of Chicago. Amtrak&#x27;s flagship station in the Midwest, Union Station is the terminus of eight national long-distance routes and eight regional corridor routes. Six Metra commuter lines also terminate here.

Union Station is just west of the Chicago River between West Adams Street and West Jackson Boulevard, adjacent to the Chicago Loop. Including approach and storage tracks, it covers about nine and a half city blocks (mostly underground, beneath streets and skyscrapers, some built with the earliest usage of railway air rights).

The present station opened in 1925, replacing an earlier union station on this site built in 1881. The station is the fourth-busiest rail station in the United States, after Pennsylvania Station, Grand Central Terminal, and Jamaica station in New York City, and the busiest outside of the Northeast Corridor. It handles about 140,000 passengers on an average weekday (including 10,000 Amtrak passengers). It has Bedford limestone Beaux-Arts facades, and an interior with massive Corinthian columns, marble floors, and a Great Hall, highlighted by brass lamps.

The station connects to multiple transit authorities including the Chicago Transit Authority bus and Chicago L lines, Metra, Pace, Greyhound, and more either within the station or within walking distance.

==Name==
Chicago Union Station is named a union station, like many train stations across the United States that were shared by several railroad companies. The station is the third union station to occupy the site between West Adams Street and West Jackson Boulevard. The station is known by the acronym CUS, as well as by its Amtrak station code CHI.

==Location==
Chicago Union Station is situated in the West Loop Gate neighborhood of the Near West Side of Chicago, just west of Chicago&#x27;s Loop. The station&#x27;s underground concourse and train sheds abut the Chicago River; passageways extend west beneath Canal Street to the main station building, one block over.

===Connections===
====Local rail service====
Unlike many major American intercity and commuter rail hubs, Union Station does not have any direct connection to local rapid transit service. However, two Chicago &quot;L&quot; stations are within walking distance of Union Station.

* (two blocks south of the station): 
* (three blocks east of the station, on The Loop): , , , and 

Metra&#x27;s other three downtown terminals – the Ogilvie Transportation Center, LaSalle Street Station and Millennium Station – are all within walking distance of Union Station. Passengers connecting from Ogilvie can access Union Station&#x27;s north platforms on the opposite side of Madison Street.

====Bus service====

Numerous CTA bus routes stop directly at Union Station:

* Union Station Transit Center: 1, 28, 121, 124, 128, 151, 156
* West side of Clinton, north side of block: 125, 130, 192
* West side of Clinton, south side of block: 7, 60, 157
* Southwest corner of Clinton/Jackson: 126, 754, 755 (Pace)

Union Station Transit Center is located adjacent to Union Station&#x27;s parking garage. The bus station opened in 2016, on land formerly used for a surface parking lot. It features an elevator and stairway to the Amtrak underground pedestrian tunnel, allowing commuters to pass between Union Station and the bus staging area without crossing at street level.

Union Station has a counter operated by the Greyhound intercity bus company. Tickets are available for purchase, and some Greyhound and Megabus buses pick up passengers on South Canal Street, on the east side of the station building. The full-service Greyhound station is four blocks southwest of Union Station.

=== Historical services ===

Union Station was served by lines in all directions even before Penn Central and Amtrak consolidated the downtown terminals. The station served as a terminal for the following railroads:
*Chicago and Alton Railroad – only a tenant, later part of the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad
*Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route)
*Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) – The station housed its corporate offices from 1924 to 1986
*Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway (PRR)
*Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Panhandle) (moved to use the PFW&amp;C approach after April 23, 1917)
*Penn Central Transportation Company (former services of the New York Central Railroad and Michigan Central Railroad) (moved from LaSalle Street Station October 27, 1968)
*Amtrak (began May 1, 1971, moved from Dearborn Station May 2, 1971 and Central Station March 6, 1972 (&quot;Floridian&quot; moved January 23, 1972); Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Calumet&quot; and &quot;Indiana Connection&quot; commuter trains also ran into Union Station)

Some of these trains and their names have survived to present Amtrak services, such as the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, and the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;.

The name &quot;Ann Rutledge&quot; was used by Amtrak as a Chicago-St. Louis-Kansas City route until a name and service consolidation in 2009. There is also a &quot;Lincoln Service&quot; that operates in Illinois.

==Interior==
===Station building===

Located west of Canal Street, Union Station&#x27;s station building occupies an entire city block. At its center is the Great Hall, the main waiting room. Arrayed around the Great Hall are numerous smaller spaces containing restaurants and services, and a wide passageway leading to the concourse. Above the main floor are several floors of office space, currently used by Amtrak. Original plans called for many more floors of offices, forming a skyscraper above the Great Hall. This was never completed, although the plan has been revived in recent years.

The Burlington Room is an event space at the northwest of the Great Hall. The room features large columns, chandeliers, four French block murals of landscape scenery, and an original mirror. The space, initially a women&#x27;s lounge, was restored in November 2016, after years of damage and neglect. For event uses, the space has color-changing lights and an audiovisual system.

The headhouse includes a space formerly used as a Fred Harvey restaurant. After a large fire in 1980, the space was damaged, windows on Clinton Street were destroyed, and the space was left vacant since then. In 2018, Amtrak announced plans to redevelop the space into a multi-level food hall, using funds from the sale of its parking garage. A new entrance and canopy would be installed on Clinton Street, and new windows would replace the bricked-up windows. The food hall was planned to open in the summer of 2020.

The headhouse also includes a Metropolitan Lounge, one of seven Amtrak offers in its stations. The lounge operates like an airport lounge, accessible to business- and first-class passengers, as well as other high-price ticketed passengers. The lounge reopened in June 2016, moving from the concourse to the headhouse. It has two stories and , double the space of the previous lounge. It features different seating areas intended for businesspeople, families and children, and people using phones or tablets. The space has bathrooms with showers, and an elevator.

===Platforms and tracks===
Union Station is laid out with a double stub-end configuration, with 10 tracks coming into the station from the north and 14 from the south. Unlike most of Amtrak&#x27;s major stations, every train calling at Union Station either originates or terminates there; all passengers traveling through Chicago must change trains to reach their final destination. There are two through tracks to allow out-of-service equipment moves between the north and south side, including one with a platform to allow extra long trains to board. Between the north and south sides of the station is a passenger concourse. Passengers can walk through the concourse to get from any platform to any other without stairs or elevators. Odd-numbered platforms (1–19) are on the north half of the station, and even-numbered platforms (2–30) on the south half. The north tracks are used by Amtrak for the &quot;Hiawatha&quot;, the &quot;Borealis&quot;, and the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;, and by Metra for the Milwaukee District West, Milwaukee District North, and North Central Service routes. The south tracks are used for all other Amtrak services, as well as by Metra for the BNSF, Heritage Corridor and SouthWest Services. Two station management structures (known as glasshouses), one on each side of the terminal, monitor train-to-track assignments and the flow of traffic in and out of the station. Actual oversight and control of switching and signalling is accomplished by two &quot;train director&quot; positions, one for each side of the station, located in the Amtrak control center in the station&#x27;s headhouse.

Numerous entrances provide access to Union Station&#x27;s underground platform level. The main entrance is on Canal Street opposite the headhouse, but passengers can also reach the platforms directly from the headhouse via an underground passageway. Two secondary entrances are located in Riverside Plaza near the Jackson Boulevard and Adams Street bridges. The Union Station Transit Center bus terminal across Jackson Boulevard has a stairway and elevator leading to the south concourse. On Madison Street, across the street, and one block east from Ogilvie Transportation Center, are a set of entrances to the north platforms.

==Architecture==

Union Station was designed by D. H. Burnham &amp; Company (known for its lead architect Daniel Burnham, who died before construction began). The successor firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst and White completed the work. The terminal was among the first to anticipate automobile traffic; it was first designed in 1909, one year after the Model T entered production. It was designed with ticket offices, concourses, platforms, waiting and baggage rooms, and shops, all on a single level, meant to be easy to navigate. At opening, the terminal also housed a hospital, chapel, and jail cell.

The main building, a square Neoclassical structure, takes up one city block. Its architectural style contrasts with modern glass-faced buildings around it. The station has wide porticos and large colonnades on its exterior. The street-level entrances utilize Indiana limestone.

The station originally featured a large Beaux-Arts concourse building along the river, made with marble, glass, and iron. Massive steel arches held up the vaulted roof, and several stairways led passengers down to the platforms. The concourse was demolished in 1969 and replaced with an office tower.

===Great Hall===
At the building&#x27;s center is the Great Hall, a -high atrium capped by a large barrel-vaulted skylight. The room has connecting lobbies, staircases, and balconies. Enormous wooden benches are arranged in the room for travelers to wait for connections, and two specially-designed underground taxicab drives were built to protect travelers from the weather. The room&#x27;s columns are of textured Roman travertine, with leafy golden Corinthian capitals. The ceilings and insets are coffered, with decorative rosettes.

Two statues by Henry Hering —&quot;Night&quot; and &quot;Day&quot; — look down on passengers, symbolizing the 24-hour operation of the railroads. The statue &quot;Night&quot; holds an owl, while &quot;Day&quot; holds a rooster.

==Related structures==
===Power station===

The Chicago Union Station Power House is a decommissioned coal-fire power plant that provided power to Union Station and its surrounding infrastructure. Located on the Chicago River, north of Roosevelt Road, it was designed in the Art Moderne style by Graham, Anderson, Probst and White in 1931. The power plant was decommissioned in 2011. It was included in Preservation Chicago&#x27;s 7 Most Endangered list in 2017 and 2020, as Amtrak has plans to demolish the building.

===Post office===
The same architecture firm that designed Union Station also designed the Old Chicago Main Post Office, a post office atop the station&#x27;s southern tracks. The post office, opened four years before Union Station, utilized the rail system, funneling mail to and from the trains below. An expansion in 1932 made the structure the world&#x27;s largest post office.

===Construction over the station&#x27;s train shed===

The large amount of land above the tracks and platforms has tempted property owners and developers. Possibly inspired by Terminal City, a development built atop New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal&#x27;s train shed, Chicago moved to develop the air rights above Union Station&#x27;s tracks. The first building to be built was that of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; in 1929. Designed in the Art Deco style, it was the first structure to add a public promenade along the river, which would be named Riverside Plaza. Soon after, in 1932, the new Chicago Main Post Office opened. Also in the Art Deco style, it is a gigantic structure that occupies two full city blocks. The Great Depression and subsequent World War II halted development, but in the 1960s, work began on Gateway Center, a Modernist complex of five buildings. Only the first four were built, and construction lasted into the 1980s through several economic cycles.

In 1990 the Morton International Building opened. Now named for Boeing, it is the tallest building yet to be constructed over the tracks. With the construction of River Point beginning in 2013 and 150 North Riverside beginning in 2014, the entire length of the train shed and tracks from Union Station north to Fulton Street and south to Polk Street is enclosed by overhead development.

Chicago Union Station&#x27;s train shed, covered by buildings built above the tracks, helped lead locomotives to funnel significant soot and smoke in and around the station. This was unlike Grand Central Terminal, which has only allowed electric trains into its trainshed since opening.

==History==
The current Union Station is the second by that name built in Chicago, and possibly the third rail station to occupy the site. The need for a single, centralized station was an important political topic in 19th and 20th-century Chicago, as various competing railroads had built a series of terminal stations. The numerous stations and associated railyards and tracks surrounded the city&#x27;s central business district, the Loop, and threatened its expansion. The various stations also made travel difficult for through-travelers, many of whom had to make inconvenient transfers often slowed by street traffic from one station to another through the Loop. Union Station was part of architect Daniel Burnham&#x27;s city-wide Plan of Chicago in 1909.

===Predecessors===

On December 25, 1858, the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad opened as far as Van Buren Street in Chicago. It built the first station at what would eventually become today&#x27;s Union Station on the west bank of the Chicago River.

The railroad built a permanent depot at the corner of Canal and Madison streets in 1861.

On April 7, 1874, five railroads agreed to build and share a union station just north of the original Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railroad station site at Van Buren Street. These railroads were:
*Pennsylvania Company (a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad)
*Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (Burlington Route)
*Michigan Central Railroad
*Chicago and Alton Railroad
*Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway (The Milwaukee Road)

The Michigan Central, which had previously been using the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s Great Central Station, soon decided to back out of the agreement, and continued to use the Illinois Central Depot. The Chicago and North Western Railway, not part of the original agreement, considered switching to the new station from its Wells Street Station but deferred instead. In 1911 it built the Chicago and North Western Passenger Terminal for its operations.

The remaining four original companies used the station when it opened in 1881. The headhouse of the Union Depot, a narrow building, fronted onto Canal Street and stretched from Madison Street to Adams Street. Tracks led into the station from the south, and platforms occupied a strip of land between the back of the headhouse and the bank of the Chicago River. South of the station, Adams, Jackson, and Van Buren Streets rose over the tracks and the river on bridges. The station, along with its successor, was effectively two back-to-back stub-end terminals. Virtually all trains arriving would terminate there, and passengers traveling further would need to change trains.

===Replacement===
Growth in passenger traffic, as well as a civic push to consolidate numerous railroad terminals, led to a proposal for an enlarged Union Station on the same site. The second Union Station would be built by the Chicago Union Station Company. This was a new company formed by all the railroads that had used the first station, save for the Chicago and Alton, which became a tenant in the new station. The Pennsylvania Railroad, then the U.S.&#x27;s largest railroad company, planned and directed the project.

The architectural firm was D. H. Burnham &amp; Company (known for its lead architect Daniel Burnham, who died before construction began). The successor firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst and White completed the work. Work began on the massive project in 1913, and required purchasing adjacent properties and moving freight facilities. Construction stalled during World War I, and resumed in 1919. The station finally opened on May 16, 1925, twelve years after construction began; some viaduct work continued into 1927. The construction cost, funded by the railroad companies involved, was projected to be $65 million, but ended up costing $75 million. Construction was delayed several times by World War I, labor shortages and strikes. The construction of the station also involved the demolition and relocation of some previously existing buildings such as the Butler Brothers Warehouse along the Chicago River. It is one of about a dozen monumental Beaux-Arts railroad stations that were among the most complicated architectural programs of the era called the &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, combining traditional architecture with engineering technology, circulation patterning and urban planning. Union Station was hailed as an outstanding achievement in railroad facility planning at the time.

===Wartime, decline, and resurgence===
During World War II, Union Station was at its busiest, handling as many as 300 trains and 100,000 passengers daily, many of them soldiers. Illustrator Norman Rockwell captured this era with his cover painting for a December 1944 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, depicting the station jammed with Christmas travelers. After the war, the growth of highway construction and private ownership of automobiles caused a severe decline in American passenger-rail ridership, including at Union Station.
In 1969, the station&#x27;s owner demolished the concourse building, making way for a modern office tower. A new and modernized, though less grand, concourse was constructed beneath the tower. In May 1971, the national railroad Amtrak was formed to take over long-distance passenger train service, while commuter trains remained privately operated. In 1980, the station&#x27;s Fred Harvey restaurant experienced a large fire. The space was damaged, windows on Clinton Street were destroyed, and the space was left vacant since then.

In 1984, Amtrak bought out the shares of Chicago Union Station Company held by Burlington Northern (successor to the Burlington Route) and the Milwaukee Road, becoming sole owner of the station.

In the 1990s, Lucien Lagrange Associates made some patchwork renovations, including to the Great Hall and its skylight, which had been blacked-out since World War II. Restoration of Union Station continued. Numerous spaces within the station had yet to be renovated, and many sat unused, especially within the station building.

===21st century===
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Amtrak closed the pair of taxicab drives in the name of security. Passenger traffic has increased and is exceeding the design capacity of the 1991 renovation. On May 1, 2002, the station was designated a Chicago Landmark, protecting its exterior, rooflines, and public interior spaces from alterations. The status protects all exteriors, rooflines, the central lightwell, vehicular drives, the Great Hall, skylight, and select interior features – balconies, porticos, corridors, lobbies, and stairs.

In 2010, Amtrak (the current owners of the Chicago Union Station Company) announced plans to air-condition the Great Hall for the first time since the 1960s. That year a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; investigation revealed high levels of diesel soot on the underground platforms of Union Station. Metra established an &quot;Emissions Task Force&quot; to study this problem and recommend solutions to improve air quality in the underground areas. In 2011, its lighting system was replaced with more energy-efficient light bulbs and motion sensors, reducing the station&#x27;s annual carbon emissions by 4 million tons. Custom steel lighting covers were added to top these safety/light towers, helping them blend in with the overall neoclassical style of the station.
In 2011, the city held a public meeting to discuss goals for the station, aiming to accommodate the expected 40 percent growth in passengers by 2040. In the following year, city agencies joined to publish a master plan for renovating and improving Union Station. Short-term goals were to improve station entrances and expand waiting rooms, as well as enhance bus lanes on Clinton and Canal Streets and create a bus terminal (completed in 2016). Goals for the next five to ten years included widening commuter platforms, using unutilized mail platforms (including an extra-long through platform) for intercity passenger trains, adding more through tracks and platforms, reorganizing facilities for better capacity and flow, increasing height clearances of the tracks, and improving street access to and from the station. Long-term, proposals include increasing capacity and improving the ambiance of the station by significantly expanding or replacing station facilities in the 200 or 300 blocks of South Canal Street. Adding track and platform capacity along Clinton Street or Canal Street was also analyzed.
In June 2015, Amtrak announced that it would renovate the station, including opening up long-closed spaces and replacing the worn staircases with marble from the original quarry near Rome. In 2016, the women&#x27;s lounge was restored, renamed the Burlington Room, and opened for use as an events space. The space was initially a women&#x27;s lounge, and later became an Amtrak warehouse. It then suffered years of neglect and water damage, and was eventually closed off. In November 2016, the room was renovated and reopened. An architecture firm removed wooden decking that divided the space into two floors, and took out a drop ceiling that defaced the original ornate ceiling. The work restored the room&#x27;s columns and chandeliers, including creating several replica chandeliers. The room also has four French block murals of landscape scenery; three of the four were cleaned and preserved, while the fourth was reproduced. An original mirror and banister were added to the room&#x27;s north end. The space was improved for events with color-changing lights and an audiovisual system.

In 2016, Amtrak held a competition for renovations and development of Union Station. The winner, Riverside Investment &amp; Development Co., proposed multiple changes, including new retail, a food hall, and two 12-story towers. The plans followed an unrealized 2007 plan for a tower addition above Union Station.
From 2018 to 2019, a $22 million restoration of the Great Hall, including restoring original detailing and rebuilding the large skylight, was completed, increasing natural light by 50 to 60 percent. The skylight, originally built in the 1920s, suffered from decades of harsh weather, leading to countless patchwork repairs, many of which blocked light from entering the Great Hall. The 2018–19 renovation restored the historic skylight to its original appearance, and added another glass skylight atop it. The new skylight is better-designed to prevent water and snow damage, and increases light entering the Great Hall.

In 2018, Riverside Investment &amp; Development Co. released a revised plan that included a seven-story addition above Union Station, adding 404 apartments to the building. The planned design was created by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, resembling Burnham&#x27;s earlier proposed tower above the station, designed to handle the weight. The addition was to be clad in glass and light bronze, differentiated from the station&#x27;s design as recommended in its landmark designation. The developers also planned to renovate the existing upper levels of Union Station&#x27;s headhouse, adding 330 hotel rooms. The proposal was met with mixed reactions by preservationists and architectural critics, with Blair Kamin, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s critic, calling it &quot;banal&quot; and &quot;top-heavy&quot;. Several months later, the developers announced they were cancelling the plan for the seven-story addition, instead constructing only a single additional penthouse floor, set back to not be visible from the street. The revised plan kept hotel rooms in the station&#x27;s upper floors, and added a proposed 50-story office tower replacing the station&#x27;s underutilized parking garage.

In 2018, Amtrak announced plans to redevelop the former Fred Harvey restaurant space into a multi-level food hall, using funds from the sale of its parking garage. A new entrance and canopy would be installed on Clinton Street, and new windows would replace the bricked-up windows. The food hall was planned to open in the summer of 2020.

In September 2019, Union Station&#x27;s 700-car parking garage permanently closed in order to be demolished. Its replacement is the , , BMO Tower, opened in 2021. The skyscraper includes a park above 400 parking spaces. The construction will not affect the pedway from the terminal to its adjacent Union Station Transit Center.

In March 2020, U.S. Representative for Illinois Dan Lipinski filed a bill to shift operational control of the terminal from Amtrak to Metra. Lipinski noted that Metra utilizes the station much more than Amtrak does, and operates its other large stations more effectively than Amtrak operates Union Station. Amtrak officials threatened to stop service to Union Station if the change is to be made, stating it would be impossible to operate and would serve as a blockade to regional and national Amtrak service. Congress was out of session during the COVID-19 pandemic, and aimed to discuss Lipinski&#x27;s bill once sessions resumed.

<doc id="950473" wikidata="Q181219" url="?curid=950473" title="Justin Fashanu">
<text>Justinus Soni &quot;Justin&quot; Fashanu ( ; 19 February 1961 – 2 May 1998) was an English footballer who played for a variety of clubs between 1978 and 1997. He was known by his early clubs to be gay, and came out publicly later in his career, becoming the first professional footballer to be openly gay. He was also one of the first footballers to command a £1 million transfer fee, with his transfer from Norwich City to Nottingham Forest in 1981, and had varying levels of success as a player afterwards, until he retired in 1997.

After moving to the United States, in 1998 he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault. He was charged, and a warrant for his arrest was issued in Howard County, Maryland, on 3 April 1998, but he had already left his flat. According to his suicide note, fearing he would not get a fair trial because of his homosexuality, he fled to England, where he killed himself in London in May 1998. His suicide note stated that the sex was consensual. In 2020, Fashanu was inducted into the National Football Museum Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==

Fashanu was the son of a Nigerian barrister living in the UK and a Guyanese nurse named Pearl. When his parents split up, he and his younger brother John were sent to a Barnardo&#x27;s care home. When he was six, he and John were fostered by Alf and Betty Jackson and were brought up in Shropham, Norfolk. Fashanu excelled at boxing as a youth, and was rumoured at one time to be pursuing a professional boxing career instead of his footballing career. Fashanu attended Attleborough High School in the 1970s where his talent for football developed, and was scouted by Norwich City scout John Sainty in a school match against Thetford Grammar School in 1974.

== Football career ==

Fashanu began his career as an apprentice with Norwich City, turning professional in December 1978. He made his league debut on 13 January 1979, against West Bromwich Albion, and settled into the Norwich side, scoring regularly and occasionally spectacularly. In 1980, he won the BBC Goal of the Season award, for a spectacular goal against Liverpool. He managed a total of 103 senior appearances for Norwich, scoring 40 goals. While at the club he was also capped six times for England at under-21 level, although an anticipated call-up to the senior side never materialised. He scored 19 league goals in the 1980–81 season, but it was not enough to prevent the Canaries from being relegated. Fashanu&#x27;s name had been linked with bigger clubs for some time, and his inevitable departure from Carrow Road came in August 1981 when he signed for Nottingham Forest, becoming Britain&#x27;s first £1 million black footballer.

His career stalled as his professional relationship with manager Brian Clough deteriorated; Clough, it would appear, was disturbed by the rumours of Fashanu&#x27;s visits to gay nightclubs and bars. His goals and then confidence dried up as he failed to fit in with the playing and lifestyle demands of Clough, especially after Clough had discovered his homosexuality and barred him from training with the side. He scored just three goals in 32 league games for Forest in 1981–82.

In his autobiography, Clough recounts a verbal dressing-down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours that he was going to gay bars. Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?&#x27; I asked him. &#x27;A baker&#x27;s, I suppose.&#x27; &#x27;Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?&#x27; &#x27;A butcher&#x27;s.&#x27; &#x27;So why do you keep going to that bloody poofs&#x27; club?

In August 1982, he was loaned to Southampton, scoring three goals in nine appearances. At The Dell, Fashanu settled in well and his promising form helped the &quot;Saints&quot; overcome the sudden departure of Kevin Keegan; manager Lawrie McMenemy would have liked to make the move permanent, but was prevented from doing so by a lack of funds.

In December 1982, he was sold to Forest&#x27;s local rivals Notts County for £150,000. He scored 20 times in 64 games for the Magpies, although he was unable to prevent them suffering back-to-back relegations, before moving to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in June 1985 for a fee of £115,000, where a knee injury soon afterwards looked to have finished his career. He went to the United States for surgery and began playing again, firstly with Los Angeles Heat and then to Canada with the Edmonton Brick Men and with the Hamilton Steelers.

He returned to England in 1989 and tried to resurrect his top level playing career, joining Manchester City on 23 October 1989, and played twice in the First Division, but on 20 November, barely a month after joining the club, he moved to West Ham United, later having a trial with Ipswich Town. He joined Leyton Orient in March 1990 and subsequently joined non-league Southall as player-coach, before spending the summer of 1991 back in North America with Toronto Blizzard. After leaving Toronto, he returned to England again to sign for semi-pro team Leatherhead.

In October 1990, he publicly came out as gay in an interview with the tabloid press, becoming the only prominent player in professional English football to do so until Jake Daniels in 2022. Although Fashanu claimed that he was generally well accepted by his fellow players, he freely admitted that they would often joke maliciously about his sexual orientation, and he also became the target of constant crowd abuse because of it.

He began a trial with Newcastle United on 24 October 1991, making one first-team appearance as a sub against Peterborough United. Manager Ossie Ardiles decided not to give him a permanent contract. He signed for Torquay United in the Third Division on 23 November 1991. He was the centre of fan and media attention while at Plainmoor: in particular, his relationship with &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Julie Goodyear featured in tabloid newspapers; but he still managed to impress on the pitch, playing 21 league games that season and scoring 10 goals, though he was unable to save Torquay from suffering relegation from the Third Division.

When Ivan Golac was appointed the manager of Torquay in February 1992, Fashanu was given the role of assistant manager and maintained this position at the end of the season when Golac was replaced by new manager Paul Compton.

On 13 April 1992, Fashanu received a £265 fine and a 28-day driving ban after being found guilty of speeding and failing to produce his driving licence.

In February 1993, with Torquay battling against a second successive relegation, from the new Division Three to the Football Conference, Fashanu applied for the vacant post of manager following Compton&#x27;s departure, but was turned down in favour of Neil Warnock. Fashanu left Torquay, having scored 15 goals in 41 games for the Gulls. He went on to play for Airdrieonians soon after but was unable to save them from suffering relegation from the Scottish Premier Division.

He left Airdrieonians in 1993, playing in Sweden with Trelleborg, before returning to Scotland, joining Heart of Midlothian in July 1993, but then had his contract terminated in February 1994 for &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; (he had attempted to sell false stories regarding him and a number of cabinet ministers to the press), and returned to the United States to coach youth football in Georgia. He later moved to Atlanta Ruckus but was suspended for the playoffs for failure to comply with the terms of his contract, before joining Miramar Rangers in New Zealand in 1997. He then moved to Ellicott City, Maryland, to coach the Maryland Mania, a new professional team in the second division USL A-League, following his officially announced retirement from the professional game.

== Coming out in the press ==
Fashanu agreed to an exclusive with &quot;The Sun&quot; tabloid newspaper to come out as gay. They ran the headline as &quot;£1m Football Star: I AM GAY&quot; on 22 October 1990. He claimed to have had an affair with a married Conservative MP, whom he first met in a London gay bar. &quot;We ended up in bed together at his London flat&quot;, he said. A week later, his brother John Fashanu agreed to an exclusive with &quot;The Voice&quot; under the headline &quot;John Fashanu: My Gay Brother is an Outcast.&quot; Justin Fashanu was interviewed for the July 1991 cover story of &quot;Gay Times&quot;, where the situation was summarised as:

:&quot;The Sun&quot; dragged out the tale with titillating stories of sexual encounters with unnamed MPs, football players and pop stars, which, he claims, were largely untrue. The revelations, nevertheless, earned him a considerable sum of money but he says he was offered even more by others who wanted him to stay in the closet. He admits that he wasn&#x27;t fully prepared for the backlash that followed and his career in football ... has suffered &quot;heavy damage&quot;. Although he&#x27;s fully fit, no club has offered him a full-time contract since the story first appeared.

In 1992, he agreed to front &quot;Loud&#x27;n&#x27;proud&quot;, a new national radio series aimed at young lesbians and gay men, but the pilot with Fashanu presenting was turned down by BBC Radio 5; it was later commissioned, with a female presenter, for BBC Radio 1.

Fashanu was the subject of an early internet meme in 1996 when the BBC opened their poll for the Sports Personality of the Year award to e-mail votes for the first time. An online campaign was organised among students in an attempt to enable him to win the title, but his votes were excluded from the final tally by the show&#x27;s production team.

== Allegation and suicide ==
In March 1998, a seventeen-year-old stated to police that he had been sexually assaulted by Fashanu after a night of drinking. Homosexual acts were illegal in the US state of Maryland at the time, and the youth stated the act was not consensual but being performed as he awoke. The assault was alleged to have taken place in Fashanu&#x27;s apartment in Ellicott City, Maryland. Fashanu was questioned about this by the police on 3 April, but he was not held in custody. The police later arrived at his flat with a warrant to arrest him on charges of second-degree sexual assault, first-degree assault, and second-degree assault, but Fashanu had already fled to England.

On the morning of 3 May, he was found hanged in a deserted lock-up garage he had broken into, in Fairchild Place, Shoreditch, London, at the age of 37, after visiting Chariots Roman Spa, a local gay sauna. In his suicide note, he denied the charges, stating that the sex was consensual, and that he had fled to England because he felt he could not get a fair trial due to his homosexuality, and he added: &quot;I realised that I had already been presumed guilty. I do not want to give any more embarrassment to my friends and family.&quot; An inquest held in London on 9 September heard evidence from a Scotland Yard detective that the Americans made no request for Fashanu to be found or arrested, and the Coroner stated that he was not a wanted man at the time he hanged himself. &quot;The Times&quot; and the BBC reported that an arrest warrant had been issued by Howard County District Court on 3 April, that he had been charged with second-degree sexual assault and first-degree and second-degree assaults punishable by up to twenty years in jail, and that Howard County police would have requested his extradition had they known he had fled to England. The inquest recorded a verdict of suicide.

Fashanu&#x27;s remains were cremated and a small ceremony was held at City of London Cemetery and Crematorium.

John Fashanu later expressed regret for some of the comments he made when his brother came out. In an interview with talkSPORT in 2012, John Fashanu claimed his brother was not gay and was merely an &quot;attention seeker&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Fashanu was listed at number 99 in the Top 500 Lesbian and Gay Heroes in &quot;The Pink Paper&quot;.

In March 2009, a football team, The Justin Fashanu All-stars, was named at a special event in Brighton, supported by the FA. The team, named in his honour, was created by the Justin Campaign, which is a campaign against homophobia in football and promotes the inclusion of openly gay players in football.

In 2017, Netflix released the film, &quot;Forbidden Games: The Justin Fashanu Story&quot;.

In 2023, a large mural of Fashanu was painted onto the wall of a pub, the Fat Cat and Canary, in Norwich replacing a mural of former Norwich manager, Daniel Farke.

<doc id="950479" wikidata="Q4848383" url="?curid=950479" title="Bailey Quarters">
<text>Bailey Quarters is a character on the television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. She was played by actress Jan Smithers, and was based on creator Hugh Wilson&#x27;s wife.

== WKRP roles ==
Bailey originally came from Chicago with a degree in journalism from The Ohio State University, where she graduated summa cum laude. Her ambition is eventually to be a broadcasting executive, but though intelligent and talented, she was held back early on by her extreme shyness and fear of speaking up. In the earliest episodes, station manager Arthur Carlson could not even remember who she was or whether &quot;Bailey&quot; was a man or a woman.

She is originally in charge of just the billing and station traffic, but that changes when Andy Travis takes over as the program director of WKRP. One of his first acts is to give Bailey more duties, including being an on-air news reporter, over the strenuous objections of sales manager Herb Tarlek and news director Les Nessman, who feels threatened. In the episode &quot;Dear Liar&quot;, a take-off on the Janet Cooke scandal, Bailey writes a news story that is partly fictional, which could have cost the station its broadcast license, though it was still in its initial draft and Bailey had not committed to using it. It only becomes an issue when Les jealously plagiarizes it on the air. Eventually the professional relationship between Les and Bailey becomes less strained, with Les allowing her more freedom and input on the station&#x27;s news reporting. During the episode &quot;In Concert&quot;, when reporting on the tragedy at the December 3, 1979 concert by The Who at Riverfront Coliseum (which Bailey had attended and Les didn&#x27;t), Les brings a depressed Bailey&#x27;s spirits up by telling her &quot;we&#x27;re newsmen… well, newspersons&quot; and telling her he needs her help to cover the story responsibly.

As the series goes on, Bailey becomes more assertive and more able to speak up for herself. She undergoes subtle changes in her hairstyle and appears in eyeglasses less and less. She becomes better at standing up to her nemesis Herb; in one episode, she throws lighted matches at Herb&#x27;s polyester suit, threatening to set it on fire. By the second season, she has evolved into a serious and dependable career-minded woman who brings &quot;a measure of sanity&quot; to the station. By the fourth season, she has developed to be on an equal footing with her co-workers.

She becomes increasingly associated with environmentalism and other activist causes. One episode begins with her circulating a petition against nuclear power; in another episode, she mentions that she spent the weekend campaigning for the Equal Rights Amendment. In the episode &quot;Circumstantial Evidence&quot;, while testifying in court, she starts complaining to the judge about the plight of baby seals and dolphins. Some of these character traits came from the actress who played Bailey, Jan Smithers, who was herself involved with animal-rights and clean-energy causes; as with many of the &quot;WKRP&quot; characters, elements of the actor were incorporated into the character, giving the character more depth as the show went on. Although Bailey did not appear in the sequel series, &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, it is revealed that she later left broadcasting and became the mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan (an ironic fate for an Ohio State grad, as Ann Arbor is the home of OSU&#x27;s great rival, the University of Michigan).

Bailey&#x27;s character was overshadowed by that of Jennifer Marlowe (played by Loni Anderson), the blonde bombshell of the station. The relationship between Jennifer and Bailey has often been likened to that between Ginger and Mary Ann from &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Two generations of American males were judged by their answers to the question &quot;Ginger or Mary Ann?&quot; and &quot;Jennifer or Bailey?&quot;, and both sets of women became cultural icons of their generations.

== Personal life ==
Bailey has an on-again, off-again romance with Dr. Johnny Fever. In the early episodes, it is suggested that Bailey looks up to Johnny as her mentor in the world of broadcasting, but that she also has a schoolgirl crush on him, which leads her to ask him out on a date in the second-season opener, &quot;For Love or Money&quot;.

In the third season, Bailey and Fever are seen in the bullpen lounging on the couch together with Bailey&#x27;s arm familiarly placed around Johnny&#x27;s shoulders (&quot;Out to Lunch&quot;). By the fourth season, their relationship develops into what Smithers characterized as &quot;more adult&quot;, giving both characters another dimension to develop. However, their relationship never seems to go further than the occasional date. (It is implied at the end of &quot;For Love or Money&quot; and &quot;Mike Fright&quot; that they have had at least casual sexual relations, though in both cases, it could be discounted as hyperbole.) In season four&#x27;s &quot;Rumors&quot;, when Johnny stays at Bailey&#x27;s place for a few days, Bailey is infuriated by the gossip that they are sleeping together, disappointing Johnny, who was hoping that the rumors would come true.

While her friend Jennifer dates mostly wealthy older men, Bailey seems to have a different taste in men, dating not only Johnny but also (in the episode &quot;In Concert&quot;) a manic-depressive divinity student with a serious drinking problem. In the episode &quot;The Americanization of Ivan&quot;, Bailey is the focus of a Soviet defector&#x27;s attentions; although he wishes her help in defecting to the U.S., the Russian is also smitten with her good looks. In the episode &quot;Jennifer Falls in Love&quot;, Bailey enters a nearly daydream-like state when merely listening to Jennifer&#x27;s description of her new blond repairman boyfriend named Steel, and is almost incapable of coherent conversation when she finally meets him.

Her occasional references to her family suggest that she does not get along well with her parents, which may explain why she left Chicago. In one episode, she mentions that a visit home consists of relatives asking her if she&#x27;s &quot;Involved? Engaged? Pregnant?&quot; In another episode, she attempts to describe her relationship with her father, but is left speechless with anger. In a third episode, Mr. Carlson mentions that &quot;I talked to Bailey&#x27;s father and he said I could shoot her.&quot;

Bailey&#x27;s best friend at the station is Jennifer, with whom she often discusses relationship matters (such as obliquely referring to her crush on Johnny, or giving Jennifer advice on how to deal with Herb). She also has a strong friendship with Venus Flytrap.

== Casting and inspiration ==
Jan Smithers was one of the few &quot;WKRP&quot; cast members who was the first choice for the role she played. Creator Hugh Wilson said that despite Smithers&#x27; lack of experience (she had never done a situation comedy before), she was perfect for the character of Bailey as he had conceived her: &quot;Other actresses read better for the part,&quot; Wilson recalled, &quot;but they were &quot;playing&quot; shy. Jan &quot;was&quot; shy.&quot;

Wilson had based the character on Charters Smith, whom Wilson would eventually marry in 1979.

== Cultural references and gender roles ==

Bailey Quarters is cited as an example of how 1970s&#x27; sitcoms reflected changing views of gender and women&#x27;s roles in society and the workplace. One aspect of this is the expectation that women would be treated equally as men. The character of Bailey joined WKRP with a journalism degree and advanced from creating promotions to writing news copy to news broadcasting. This progression confirmed that hard work and talent would be rewarded, reinforced values of equality and diversity, and provided female viewers with reassurance of seeing a friendly, supportive workplace, and a character that struggled to be assertive and to overcome shyness, succeeding in gaining the respect of her coworkers. Even insecure, shy and chauvinistic newsman Les learns to accept assistance in his job from a woman as he learns to respect Bailey&#x27;s ability and also respect Bailey as a person.

Bailey Quarters is contrasted not only with the other principal female character, receptionist Jennifer Marlowe, but also with the male characters. In contrast to Jennifer, Bailey seeks recognition in a &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; field of journalism for her work in that field.
Jennifer and Bailey offer, in a blonde-brunette dyad typical of sitcoms of the era, contrasting portrayals of female sexuality from opposite ends of the spectrum. 

In Bailey, male viewers saw a real woman who they could possibly actually have met and developed a relationship with, while Jennifer Marlowe was an idealized woman who did not really exist in the common experience of most male viewers. Bailey demonstrated that a woman could be smart and nerdy, but also exceptionally beautiful (Jan Smithers was a teen and fashion model in real life, including an iconic appearance on the cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in March 1966 representing the mid-60s, pre-hippie youth of America). The methodology with which the contrasts, differences and values between the traditional female character traits of Jennifer Marlowe and the more modern, liberal, feminist character traits of Bailey Quarters were drawn and explored made &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; a uniquely insightful and interesting production, with the character of Bailey Quarters becoming an everywoman feminist icon of the 1970s, expressing a less radical, and more realistic, feminism that many women viewers of the program could relate to.

Bailey Quarters was one of the first media examples of the popular naming convention of use of a surname as a female first name. For men it was Charles Patrick &quot;Ryan&quot; O&#x27;Neal.

<text>Frederic Wood Barnes Jr. (born February 1, 1943) is an American political commentator. He was the executive editor of the defunct news publication &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; and regularly appears on the Fox News Channel program &quot;Special Report with Bret Baier&quot;. He was previously co-host of &quot;The Beltway Boys&quot; with Mort Kondracke, which previously aired on the Fox News Channel. Barnes remains a prolific writer on presidential and many other political topics as well.

==Early life and education==
Barnes was born in West Point, New York. He earned a B.A. degree from the University of Virginia in 1965.

==Career==
After spending several years as a journalist with &quot;The Charleston News and Courier&quot; in Charleston, South Carolina, he became a reporter for the &quot;Washington Star&quot;. He covered the Supreme Court and the White House for the &quot;Star&quot; before moving to the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;, where he was the national political correspondent.

From 1985 to 1995, he was senior editor and White House correspondent for &quot;The New Republic&quot;. He also wrote the &quot;Presswatch&quot; media column for the &quot;American Spectator&quot;. He was a panelist on the public affairs show &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; from 1985 to 1998, where he was often referred to by the show&#x27;s host as Freddy &quot;the Beadle&quot; Barnes. Barnes hosted the radio show &quot;What&#x27;s the Story&quot; for Radio America. He is currently a moderator for the Voice of America show &quot;Issues in the News&quot;.

In 1984, Barnes was chosen to be one of three panelists quizzing then-President Ronald Reagan and challenger Walter Mondale in the first nationally televised debate of the 1984 presidential campaign.

Barnes has made cameo appearances in the Hollywood films &quot;Dave&quot;, &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;, and&quot; Independence Day&quot;. He has thrown out the first pitch for a Boston Red Sox baseball game at Fenway Park.

In 2006 Barnes wrote a favorable biography of President George W. Bush titled &quot;Rebel in Chief.&quot; Reviewing it in &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot;, Isaac Chotiner called it &quot;fawning and at times unintentionally amusing&quot;, revealing its author as a &quot;perfect Bush hack&quot;. He is a member of the board of the Institute on Religion and Democracy. As a member of The Falls Church, he and his family voted to disaffiliate the congregation from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. He is a member of the board of trustees of The Fund for American Studies, in which he also serves as a senior fellow.

In the days leading up to the 2008 United States election, Barnes was the only political pundit out of 27 catalogued by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; (including Karl Rove, Alex Castellanos, Matthew Dowd, Ed Rollins, and George Will) to predict a John McCain victory for U.S. President (286 to 252 electoral votes).

==Personal life==
Barnes married Barbara Beatty in 1967. The couple has three children.

<text>Richard Paul Kiley (March 31, 1922 – March 5, 1999) was an American stage, film, and television actor and singer. He is best-known for his distinguished theatrical career in which he twice won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Kiley created the role of Don Quixote in the original 1965 production of the Broadway musical &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; and was the first to sing and record &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, the hit song from the show. In the 1953 hit musical &quot;Kismet&quot;, he played the Caliph in the original Broadway cast and, as such, was one of the quartet who sang &quot;And This Is My Beloved&quot;. Additionally, he won four Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards during his 50-year career and his &quot;sonorous baritone&quot; was also featured in the narration of a number of documentaries and other films. At the time of his death, Kiley was described as &quot;one of theater&#x27;s most distinguished and versatile actors&quot; and as &quot;an indispensable actor, the kind of performer who could be called on to play kings and commoners and a diversity of characters in between.&quot;

==Early life==
Kiley was born on March 31, 1922, in Chicago, and raised Catholic. He graduated from Mt. Carmel High School in 1939, and after a year at Loyola University Chicago he left to study acting at Chicago&#x27;s Barnum Dramatic School. In the late 1940s, he performed in Chicago-area summer stock theaters with actors such as Alan Furlan. Following his service in the Navy during World War II, he returned to Chicago working as an actor and announcer on radio before moving to New York City. In New York he studied singing with Ray Smolover.

==Career==
Kiley&#x27;s work on stage included &quot;Kismet&quot;, &quot;No Strings&quot; (which was Richard Rodgers&#x27;s first stage musical after the death of Oscar Hammerstein II, in which Rodgers wrote both music and lyrics), the Buddy Hackett vehicle &quot;I Had a Ball&quot;, and the lead roles in &quot;Redhead&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, and the play &quot;The Incomparable Max&quot;.

Kiley later starred in the television play &quot;Patterns&quot;, which aired live on January 12, 1955. It caused a sensation and won an Emmy for its writer, Rod Serling. He played the role of John Malcolm Patterson, future Attorney General of Alabama (and later Governor of Alabama), in the 1955 film &quot;The Phenix City Story&quot;. Kiley also portrayed math teacher Joshua Edwards, whose phonograph records were smashed by delinquents in &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; in 1955.

Kiley won Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;Redhead&quot; in 1959 and &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; in 1966. The dual role of middle-aged author Cervantes and his fictional creation Quixote is one of the few musical roles that requires the talents of both leading man and character actor. Kiley said while &quot;La Mancha&quot; was on Broadway that despite the fact he had grown tired of playing leading men, he would always be grateful for having been given the chance to perform in &quot;La Mancha&quot;. He performed in the original production for over five years and returned for Broadway revivals in 1972 and 1977 saying he had become &quot;very possessive&quot; of the role.

Kiley won three Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards for his work in television. He won both an Emmy and Golden Globe awards for &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (as Paddy, Rachel Ward&#x27;s father) (1983) and &quot;A Year in the Life&quot; (1986, 1987–1988). His third Emmy win was for Guest Actor in a Drama Series, for an episode of &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, in which he had a recurring role as the father of main character Jill Brock (Kathy Baker). Kiley also received an Emmy nomination for portraying Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1991 miniseries &quot;Separate but Equal&quot; dramatizing Brown vs. Board of Education.

Other television work included as the murderous police commissioner on &quot;Columbo&quot; (1974, the episode &quot;A Friend In Deed&quot;), his appearance as Gideon Seyetik in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Second Sight&quot;, as well as guest roles on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He narrated the award-winning seven-part 1986 PBS documentary &quot;Planet Earth&quot;.

Kiley&#x27;s baritone made him a favorite to narrate documentaries for television. Starting with ‘Land of the Tiger’ in 1985, Richard Kiley provided narration for multiple National Geographic Video television specials. Kiley also voiced two 1975 episodes of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot;.

In &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, Kiley&#x27;s voice narrates the park&#x27;s vehicle tour. Kiley was introduced as the narrator for the tour first in the novel by Michael Crichton and later in the film adaptation by Steven Spielberg where the owner of the park said he &quot;spared no expense&quot; hiring Kiley. Visitors to Universal&#x27;s Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida, and the former attraction at Universal Studios Hollywood hear Kiley as the narrator of the Jurassic Park River Adventure ride – making him the only person to appear in the book, the film, and the ride.

Kiley also narrated the A&amp;E documentary television series &quot;Mysteries of the Bible&quot;, from 1994 to 1998. His final acting role was in the 1999 TV movie &quot;Blue Moon,&quot; which debuted the month after his death.

==Death==
Kiley died of an unspecified bone marrow disease at Horton Hospital in Middletown, New York, on March 5, 1999, less than a month before his 77th birthday. He was survived by his wife, dancer Patricia Ferrier, and six children from his first marriage: sons David and Michael Kiley and daughters Kathleen, Dorothea, Erin and Deirdre. His remains were interred in Warwick, New York. Broadway&#x27;s lights went dark in his honor.

<doc id="950503" wikidata="Q304971" url="?curid=950503" title="Buddah Records">
<text>Buddah Records (later known as Buddha Records) was an American record label founded in 1967 in New York City. The label was born out of Kama Sutra Records, an MGM Records-distributed label, which remained a key imprint following Buddah&#x27;s founding. Buddah handled a variety of music genres, including bubblegum pop (the Ohio Express and the 1910 Fruitgum Company), folk rock (Melanie), experimental music (Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band), and soul (Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips).

In addition to the Buddah imprint, the company distributed many other independent labels, including Kama Sutra Records (after Kama Sutra cut their distribution ties with MGM in 1969), Curtom Records (Curtis Mayfield), T-Neck Records (the Isley Brothers), Charisma Records (Genesis, Monty Python), Sussex Records (Bill Withers), Hot Wax Records (Holland-Dozier-Holland post-Motown productions) and smaller subsidiaries.

==History==
Kama Sutra Records helped bolster MGM Records&#x27;s profits during 1965 and 1966, primarily due to the success of Kama Sutra&#x27;s flagship artists The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful. Kama Sutra&#x27;s head, Art Kass, ultimately grew dissatisfied with his distribution deal with MGM and founded Buddah Records in 1967, with his Kama Sutra partners, Artie Ripp, Hy Mizrahi, Phil Steinberg, and (allegedly) Italian mobster John &quot;Sonny&quot; Franzese.

Kass brought in 24-year-old Neil Bogart to oversee Buddah&#x27;s daily operations. Bogart had been an MGM General Manager in the early 1960s before taking a VP/Sales Director position at Cameo-Parkway Records. Bogart quickly enlisted Cameo-Parkway producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeffry Katz, the Ohio Express (a band signed to Kasenetz&#x27;s and Katz&#x27;s Super K Productions firm), and ex-Cameo artists the Five Stairsteps into the new label. Buddah&#x27;s first single was &quot;Yes, We Have No Bananas&quot;/&quot;The Audition&quot; by the Mulberry Fruit Band; the label&#x27;s first album was &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; by Captain Beefheart &amp; His Magic Band. Kass and Bogart also brought along the promotion department of Cameo-Parkway, which was shutting down.

Buddah initially made its mark as a bubblegum pop music label, with Ohio Express, the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus. However, it was The Lemon Pipers who gave Buddah its first No. 1 hit with &quot;Green Tambourine&quot;, produced by Paul Leka, in February 1968.

The New York-area visual aids company Viewlex purchased a controlling interest in Buddah in 1968 with Ripp, Steinberg and Mizrahi departing the company at this time, leaving Kass and Bogart in charge.

As bubblegum music&#x27;s popularity declined at the turn of the decade, Buddah branched out into gospel, folk-country, and R&amp;B. Bogart, a master promoter, went to great lengths to generate hit singles for &quot;top 40&quot; radio airplay, and got results; music industry historian Bob Hyde has estimated that, during their heyday, Buddah and its associated labels charted over 100 singles, with about one in five singles issued by the company charting (vs. the ratio of one chart hit to 20 singles released that most &quot;major labels&quot; experienced in that time period).
Hit singles released by Buddah and its associated labels during 1969–1973 included:

*The Brooklyn Bridge&#x27;s &quot;Worst That Could Happen&quot; (1969)
*The Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; (1969)
*The Edwin Hawkins Singers&#x27; &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; (1969)
*Lou Christie&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Mine&quot; (1969)
*Melanie&#x27;s &quot;Lay Down (Candles in the Rain)&quot; and &quot;What Have They Done to My Song Ma&quot; (1970)
*The Five Stairsteps&#x27; &quot;O-o-h Child&quot; (1970)
*The Jaggerz&#x27; &quot;The Rapper&quot; (written by and featuring a young Donnie Iris) (1970)
*100 Proof (Aged in Soul)&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Been Sleeping in My Bed&quot; (1970)
*Brewer &amp; Shipley&#x27;s &quot;One Toke Over the Line&quot; (1970)
*Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand&quot; (1971)
*Honey Cone&#x27;s &quot;Want Ads&quot; (1971)
*Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Sunshine&quot; (1971), &quot;Lean on Me&quot; (1972) and &quot;Use Me&quot; (1972)
*Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Nice to Be With You&quot; (1972)
*Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Super Fly&quot; and &quot;Freddie&#x27;s Dead&quot; (1972)
*Gunhill Road&#x27;s &quot;Back When My Hair Was Short&quot; (1973)
*Charlie Daniels&#x27; &quot;Uneasy Rider&quot; (1973)
*Stories&#x27; &quot;Brother Louie&quot; (1973)
*Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me&quot; and &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; (1973)

While Buddah primarily focused on singles, several of its album releases, including Brewer &amp; Shipley&#x27;s &quot;Tarkio&quot; (1970), Bill Withers&#x27; &quot;Still Bill&quot; (1972), and Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Super Fly&quot; (1972), also charted well during this period.

Neil Bogart created and distributed Brut Records via Buddah Records for the Brut Fabergé company.

Bogart left Buddah in 1974 to start his own label, Casablanca Records. Shortly before Bogart&#x27;s departure, Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips emerged as Buddah&#x27;s biggest success. Previously signed to Motown Records&#x27; Soul imprint, Knight and the Pips released their biggest hits, including &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me&quot;, for Buddah.

Jazz session drummer Norman Connors became Buddah&#x27;s musical director in 1976 and helped to foster the label&#x27;s move toward R&amp;B and disco (e.g., the Andrea True Connection&#x27;s &quot;More, More, More&quot; (1976) and Chic&#x27;s &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)&quot; (1977); Chic&#x27;s song charted upon its subsequent re-issue by Atlantic Records). Viewlex declared bankruptcy in 1976 and Art Kass purchased Buddah back from them, but the debt resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new releases. Arista Records took over distribution of Buddah from 1978 to 1983, with several artists, including Norman Connors and Phyllis Hyman, switching to Arista.

Buddah&#x27;s final release of new product came in mid-1983, with Michael Henderson&#x27;s R&amp;B hit &quot;Fickle&quot; and the accompanying album of the same name. Kama Sutra&#x27;s final issue came a year later, with the Fat Boys (formerly the Disco 3)&#x27;s self-titled single. Art Kass subsequently sold the label to Essex Entertainment, who managed the Buddah catalog until 1993, when they sold it to BMG. Kass formed another label, Casino Records, in partnership with former New York Dolls manager Marty Thau and concert promoter Terrell Braly, but this venture was not successful.
Buddah, now known as Buddha Records, was re-activated by BMG in September 1998 as a reissue label, which was subsequently reorganized as BMG Heritage Records on January 1, 2002. The Buddah/Buddha catalogue is now owned by Sony Music Entertainment and managed by Legacy Recordings.

==Subsidiary and affiliated labels==
Buddah distributed many labels during its history, including the following:
*the wholly owned subsidiary Kama Sutra Records, from 1969 (when Kama Sutra&#x27;s distribution deal with MGM Records expired) to 1976.
*Curtom Records, founded and owned by Curtis Mayfield, (1968–1974)
*Sussex Records, (1971–1973)
*T-Neck Records, owned by the Isley Brothers, (1969–1973)
*Charisma Records, the U.K.-based label founded by Tony Stratton Smith, distributed 1971–1973. Buddah adopted the Gill Ultra Bold font Charisma used on their &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; label to create a uniform branding for its key labels (Buddah, Kama Sutra, Charisma) in 1973, although Charisma&#x27;s distribution deal with Buddah ended later that year.
*Hot Wax Records, owned by Motown songwriting trio Holland-Dozier-Holland, 1969–1973.
*Cobblestone Records, a jazz label.
*Pavilion Records, a short-lived gospel music imprint best known for its release of &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot; by The Edwin Hawkins Singers in 1969.
*Studio One Records, the Jamaican label founded by Coxsone Dodd. Buddah released various selections from Studio One&#x27;s back catalog in 1978.

Other Buddah subsidiaries or associated labels included Radio Active Gold (for reissue singles), Team, Super K, Royal American, Symbolic, Eleuthera, Ember, Pace, Desert Moon, Pi Kappa, Southwind, April, Thomas, Harbour, Music Merchant, National General, and Brut.

==Label design variations==
*1967: &quot;Buddah Records&quot; in stylized black letters at the bottom. Singles were designated with green labels, albums with red labels
*1968–1972: Multi-color &quot;kaleidoscope&quot; label with silhouette of a Shiva deity (not Buddha) at the bottom of the label between the words &quot;Buddah&quot; and &quot;Records&quot; (same format for both singles and albums)
*1972–1978: Maroon label with pink circle around outer edge, &quot;Buddah Records&quot; at top of label in white letters (deliberately borrowing from the Gill Ultra Bold font used on Charisma Records&#x27;s &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; label for a uniform branding). Singles feature the head of a Buddha statue at the top of the label, albums show the entire statue at the bottom. When Arista took over distribution in 1978, the Arista logo and disclaimer were added by stamp at the bottom, starting with this label format
*1978–1983: Black label with multi–colored &quot;B&quot; logo at top in a box, &quot;Buddah&quot; in white letters under the &quot;B&quot; in a subsection of the box, Arista logo and disclaimer at the bottom (same format for singles and albums)

<text>Kappa Delta Rho (), commonly known as KDR, is an American collegiate social fraternity that was established at Middlebury College in 1905. It has chartered 84 chapters, 35 of which are active, in the United States, primarily in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

==History==
===Founding and development===
Kappa Delta Rho was founded in room 14 of Old Painter Hall at Middlebury College in Middlebury, Vermont on May 17, 1905. Middlebury was the site of chapters of three fraternities that year: Chi Psi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Delta Upsilon. However, not finding these organizations to their liking, the founders of Kappa Delta Rho chose to create their new organization. Kappa Delta Rho was the created by ten men from the Middlebury Commons Club. The ten principal founders are George Edwin Kimball, Irving Thurston Coates, John Beecher, Pierce Wordsworth Darrow, Thomas Howard Bartley, Benjamin Edward Farr, Gideon Russell Norton, Gino Arturo Ratti, Chester Monroe Walch and Roy Dyer Wood.

In the fraternity&#x27;s first year, founders Kimball, Walch, and Ratti met by committee to draft the ritual, open motto, and constitution. Walch created the fraternity&#x27;s secret motto and password. For its organizational structure, the founders chose Roman nomenclature for fraternity positions, evocative of Roman values. Ratti, who had previous artistic experience, designed the coat of arms and helped develop the ritual. He also chose the fraternity&#x27;s colors and flower.

This activity was soon noticed by a representative from Delta Tau Delta fraternity, who met with the founding members to discuss the absorption of KDR into DTD. While the founders indeed had expressed some interest in joining a national fraternity, the debate soon turned against this idea. In Kimball&#x27;s words: &quot;We had decided that we preferred to paddle our own canoe and took no further action in the matter.&quot; Yet the idea of national expansion took root, and by 1913, KDR had established its second chapter, Beta, at Cornell, and soon after, its third chapter, Gamma, at SUNY Albany.

===Growth===
Kappa Delta Rho became a Junior Member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) in 1921, and a Senior Member in 1929.

Growth continued after World War II, when chapters that had briefly ceased operations reopened to returning students, and expansion again became possible. Similarly, after World War II, the fraternity successfully reopened to the flood of returning GIs fifteen of its then twenty chapters in the fall of 1946.

In 1960, the KDR Trust was formed, which marked the birth of today&#x27;s KDR Foundation, an educational, charitable, and literary foundation.

KDR has allowed moderate expansion during most of its history, with several new chapters forming in each ensuing decade. The pace of chapter growth increased substantially in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, while the 1970s saw just two chapters formed, during the 1980s the fraternity gained 28 new chapters. All told, the fraternity has organized at more than 80 campuses, and from these boasts 35 active chapters and colonies. See the list of KDR chapters.

===Co-educational pressure===
Unusual among college fraternities, KDR&#x27;s &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at Middlebury chose to coeducate or accept both male and female members in 1989, due to a policy at the school against single-sex organizations. Their choice was stark: either that or disband, an unthinkable choice for the founding chapter of a national fraternity. After several years of negotiation, the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was restored to its place as the eldest chapter of the fraternity and by agreement was the only chapter of the Kappa Delta Rho &quot;Society&quot;, a parallel branch of the fraternity meant to support this, its only co-ed chapter.

Because of its special status, &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; maintained its traditions and a unique badge, slightly modified from the standard fraternity badge, which ironically, Alpha men had designed at the 1905 birth of the fraternity. &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; was also the only nationally affiliated fraternity chapter at Middlebury, where all other groups remain &quot;locals&quot;. On June 25, 2015, Middlebury College terminated its relationship with KDR.

Kappa Delta Rho is one of two fraternities (the other being Alpha Delta Phi) to have a co-ed chapter within the North American Interfraternity Conference.

==Symbols and traditions==
Kappa Delta Rho&#x27;s open motto is &quot;Honor Super Omnia&quot; or &quot;Honor Above All Things&quot;. The fraternity&#x27;s publications describe its values as fellowship, leadership, scholarship, service, and tradition. Its credo was first nationally published in &quot;The Fraternity Month&quot; in October 1946. The author was George E. Shaw, Alpha (1910), director of Kappa Delta Rho and national historian.

Its colors are Middlebury blue and Princeton orange. Its flower is the red rose and its symbol is the Peregrine falcon. The fraternity&#x27;s badge is gold and set in pearls, in the form of the Greek letters &#x27; and , with &#x27; on top.

The Kappa Delta Rho coat of arms is a shield over crossed daggers. On the shield, is a scale, an open book, and a lighted lamp. Under the shield, in scroll with the fraternity&#x27;s motto in Latin.

==Publications==
The National Office of the fraternity publishes a semi-annual news magazine called the &quot;Quill &amp; Scroll&quot;. First published as &quot;The Scroll&quot; in 1909 at Middlebury College, the Fraternity changed its name in 1924 after it became a national publication. Today, articles in &quot;The Quill and Scroll&quot; detail the successes of the National Fraternity, the various alumni corporations, undergraduate chapters, and individual members. The articles reflect the high ideals of KDR as experienced by its undergraduates and alumni.

The &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is the KDR educational and historical manual. It is given to those who choose to pledge to the fraternity so that they may understand the responsibilities of membership. It also provides them with an introduction to how KDR is organized, how it operates, and what the roles are of the chapter, alumni, and National Office. The Manual is updated every few years by the National Office to bring it up to date with new information, policies, and ideas.

==Awards==
Awards are given out to chapters and individual Brothers each year at the National Convention. Chapter awards include the Robert D. Corrie Award for Chapter of The Year, O.D. Roberts Award for Chapter Improvement, Donald C. Wolfe for Outstanding Newsletter, George E. Kimball Award for Outstanding Social Service, John L. Blakely Award for Outstanding Philanthropics, Leo T. Wolford Award for Outstanding Campus Involvement, Gino A. Ratti Award for Outstanding Alumni Relations, E. Mayer Maloney Award for Outstanding Faculty Relations, Dr. Harold Osborn Award for Outstanding Intramural Sports, and the George E. Shaw Award for Outstanding Public Relations.

Individual awards are also handed out, including Outstanding Senior, Outstanding New Member, Outstanding Advisor, and the Red Rose Award. In addition, qualified Alumni may be inducted into the prestigious Ordo Honoris based upon achievements in either their career, community, or their dedication to the fraternity.

==Foundation==
Kappa Delta Rho is financially supported through undergraduate dues and by the Kappa Delta Rho Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charity. The Foundation raises funds from Brothers, family, and friends of KDR to financially support the educational, leadership, and character development programs undertaken by the National Fraternity. The Foundation also manages both individual and collective scholarship endowments of the National Fraternity, providing more than $100,000 in academic support each year to qualified members of the Fraternity.

===Scholarships===
The Kappa Delta Rho Foundation provides competitive scholarships based on academic achievement, as well as financial need. Applications are submitted online. The Foundation also serves as a caretaker to several Chapter-specific scholarships and area-of-study-specific scholarships that can be applied for with the same application. The Foundation typically gives away more than $100,000 in annual scholarships with individual awards ranging from a minimum of $500 upwards to $5,000.

In addition to competitive academic scholarships the Foundation also gives away non-competitive New Member academic scholarships. Any KDR brother who received above a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale during his pledging semester will receive $100 from the Foundation, providing they submit the proper documentation.

The Kappa Delta Rho Foundation also offers scholarships for the Undergraduate Interfraternity Institute and Futures Quest, both of which are educational programs run by the North American Interfraternity Conference. The scholarships cover the full cost of registration for each program.

===Programs===
The Elmon M. Williams Leadership Academy is a multi-day leadership program that occurs each August (in conjunction with the National Convention in even-numbered years) and is funded in large part by the Foundation. The Academy allows undergraduate KDR brothers to learn more about being an effective leader in their Chapter and the professional world.

The Consuls Academy is a three-day leadership program held every January for incoming Chapter Consuls (presidents). This intensive academy prepares Consuls for the responsibilities of running a Chapter.

In 2007 the KDR Foundation created the Kappa Delta Rho Wilderness Institute, which occurred once a year in a different wilderness location around the country. Brothers who were admitted to the program through an application process took part in a multi-day hike that was led by an alumni mentor and experienced guide. The program was designed to provide hands-on leadership programming, substance-free brotherhood-building activities, personal growth opportunities, and core values exploration. The Wilderness Institute continued until 2011.

In 2014, KDR introduced a total-member education program called The Legion. This innovative four-year personal development track grounded in the Fraternity&#x27;s values combines the latest educational technology with a holistic personal development curriculum to mold Brothers from the first day of new member education to prepare them for life after graduation.

== Chapters ==

Kappa Delta Rho has 84 chapters, 35 of which are active.

== Local chapter or individual member misconduct ==

In 2003, the KDR chapter at Colgate University had its recognition withdrawn for repeated violations of the university&#x27;s hazing policy. 

In 2015, the KDR chapter at Pennsylvania State University was suspended for three years after their private Facebook page that showed naked women who appeared to be sleeping, passed out, or otherwise incapacitated, apparently without the subjects&#x27; consent. At least 144 current KDR members and alumni were members of the social media group. An earlier version of the site had been taken down after a woman saw a naked photo of herself and threatened to report it. 38 members of the fraternity were expelled. A student claimed that as a pledge, he was burned with cigarettes, physically beaten, and forced to drink liquor mixed with urine and hot sauce.

As of 2024, Bucknell University does not recognize KDR.

<text>A farrier is a specialist in equine hoof care, including the trimming and balancing of horses&#x27; hooves and the placing of shoes on their hooves, if necessary. A farrier combines some blacksmith&#x27;s skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some veterinarian&#x27;s skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb) to care for horses&#x27; feet. Traditionally an occupation for men, in a number of countries women have now become farriers.

==History==
While the practice of putting protective hoof coverings on horses dates back to the first century, evidence suggests that the practice of nailing iron shoes into a horse&#x27;s hoof is a much later invention. One of the first archaeological discoveries of an iron horseshoe was found in the tomb of Merovingian king Childeric I, who reigned from 458 to 481 or 482. The discovery was made by Adrien Quinquin in 1653, and the findings were written about by Jean-Jacques Chifflet in 1655. Chifflet wrote that the iron horseshoe was so rusted that it fell apart as he attempted to clean it. He did, however, make an illustration of the shoe and noted that it had four holes on each side for nails. Although this discovery places the existence of iron horseshoes during the later half of the fifth century, their further usage is not recorded until closer to the end of the millennium. Carolingian Capitularies, legal acts composed and published by Frankish kings until the ninth century, display a high degree of attention to detail when it came to military matters, even going as far as to specify which weapons and equipment soldiers were to bring when called upon for war. With each Capitulary that calls for horsemen, no mention of horseshoes can be found. Excavations from Viking-age burials also demonstrate a lack of iron horseshoes, even though many of the stirrups and other horse tack survived. A burial dig in Slovenia discovered iron bits, stirrups, and saddle parts but no horseshoes. The first literary mention of nailed horseshoes is found within Ekkehard&#x27;s Waltharius, written c. 920 AD. The practice of shoeing horses in Europe likely originated in Western Europe, where they had more need due to the way the climate affected horses&#x27; hooves, before spreading eastward and northward by 1000 AD.

The task of shoeing horses was originally performed by blacksmiths, owing to the origin of the word found within the Latin &quot;ferrum&quot;. However, by the time of Edward III of England (r. 1327–1377) the position, among others, had become much more specialized. This was part of a larger trend in specialization and the division of labour in England at the time. In 1350, Edward released an ordinance concerning pay and wages within the city of London. In the ordinance it mentioned farriers and decreed that they were not to charge more for their services than &quot;they were wont to take before the time of the pestilence.&quot; The pestilence mentioned was the Black Death, which places the existence of farriers as a trade independent of blacksmiths at the latest in 1346. In 1350, a statute from Edward designated the shoer of horses at court to be the ferrour des chivaux (literally Shoer of Horses), who would be sworn in before judges. The ferrour des chivaux would swear to do his craft properly and to limit himself solely to it. The increasing division of labour in England, especially in regards to the farriers, proved beneficial for Edward III during the first phase of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The English army traveled into France with an immense baggage train that possessed its own forges in order for the Sergeants-Farrier and his assistants to shoe horses in the field. The increased specialization of the fourteenth century allowed Edward to create a self-sufficient army, thus contributing to his military success in France.  

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;farrier&quot; can be traced back to the Middle English word , which referred to a blacksmith who also shoed horses. can be traced back to the even earlier Old French , which in itself is based upon the Latin , meaning &#x27;iron&#x27;.

==Work==
James Blurton, 2005 World Champion Farrier, said, &quot;Farriery is all about technique and getting the horse to do the work for you. It is not a wrestling match.&quot;

A farrier&#x27;s routine work is primarily hoof trimming and shoeing. In ordinary cases, trimming each hoof so it retains proper foot function is important. If the animal has a heavy work load, works on abrasive footing, needs additional traction, or has pathological changes in the hoof or conformational challenges, then shoes may be required. Additional tasks for the farrier include dealing with injured or diseased hooves and application of special shoes for racing, training, or &quot;cosmetic&quot; purposes. Horses with certain diseases or injuries may need remedial procedures for their hooves, or need special shoes.

Traditionally, farriers worked in premises such as forges with yards where they could hot-shoe a number of horses. Changes in the industry including the introduction of electric grinders, gas-powered portable forges, ready-made shoes, and plastic stick-on shoes, have now made travelling to individual clients possible.

==Qualifications==
In countries such as the United Kingdom, people other than registered farriers cannot legally call themselves a farrier or carry out any farriery work (in the UK, this is under the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975). The primary aim of the act is to &quot;prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons&quot;.

However, in other countries, such as the United States, farriery is not regulated, no legal certification exists, and qualifications can vary. In the US, four organizations—the American Farrier&#x27;s Association (AFA), the Guild of Professional Farriers (GPF), the Brotherhood of Working Farriers, and the Equine Lameness Prevention Organization (ELPO)—maintain voluntary certification programs for farriers. Of these, the AFA&#x27;s program is the largest, with about 2800 certified farriers. Additionally, the AFA program has a reciprocity agreement with the Farrier Registration Council and the Worshipful Company of Farriers in the UK.

Within the certification programs offered by the AFA, the GPF, and the ELPO, all farrier examinations are conducted by peer panels. The farrier examinations for these organizations are designed so that qualified farriers may obtain a formal credential indicating they meet a meaningful standard of professional competence as determined by technical knowledge and practical skills examinations, length of field experience, and other factors. Farriers who have received a certificate of completion for attending a farrier school or course may represent themselves as having completed a particular course of study. Sometimes, usually for purposes of brevity, they use the term &quot;certified&quot; in advertising.

Where professional registration exists, on either a compulsory or voluntary basis, a requirement for continuing professional development activity often exists to maintain a particular license or certification. For instance, farriers voluntarily registered with the American Association of Professional Farriers require at least 16 hours of continuing education every year to maintain their accreditation.

== Female farriers ==
Traditionally, farriery has been seen as a career for men although images do show women shoeing horses at a horse hospital in the early twentieth century. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, however, the number of women entering the profession has risen in, for example, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Senegal, the UK and the USA. Changes in materials and ways of working make it easier for women to combine the career with motherhood. Women in the UK are now becoming &#x27;master&#x27; farriers and Fellows of the Worshipful Company of Farriers, training apprentice farriers from around the world.

<text>Rosann Wowchuk (née Harapiak; born August 15, 1945) is a former Manitoba politician, and was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments of Premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger.

The daughter of William Harapiak and Mary Philipchuk, she was born Rosann Harapiak in Cowan, Manitoba. She attended Manitoba Teacher&#x27;s College, and subsequently worked as a teacher and farmer. In 1968, she married Sylvestor Wowchuk. She served as a municipal councillor and deputy reeve in the mid-northern community of Swan River from 1983 to 1990. Her brothers, Leonard and Harry Harapiak, were both NDP cabinet ministers during the 1980s.

Wowchuk was first elected to the Manitoba Legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Parker Burrell in the riding of Swan River. She was re-elected in the 1995 election, defeating Tory candidate Fred Betcher by only 36 votes. There are many who believe that Independent Native Voice candidate Nelson Contois, who received 118 votes, was encouraged to run by local Tory organizers in an attempt to split the riding&#x27;s left-of-centre vote. Also in 1995, Wowchuk supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

After spending nine years as an opposition MLA, Wowchuk moved to the government benches in 1999 after Gary Doer&#x27;s NDP won a parliamentary majority. She was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Food on October 5, 1999, and held this portfolio for the entirety of the Doer government&#x27;s first term. In 2003, she supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal NDP.

Wowchuk was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 2003, and was named deputy premier three days later. Retaining the agriculture portfolio, she was given ministerial responsibility for Intergovernmental Affairs and Cooperative Development on June 25. On November 4, the name of her ministry was changed to Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives, and she was relieved of responsibilities for Intergovernmental Affairs.

Although Wowchuk opposed the decision of Gary Filmon&#x27;s government to eliminate the &quot;single-desk&quot; marketing of hog farms, she did not reverse the policy upon joining government. In 2004, she rejected a request from the Manitoba Cattle Producers that all livestock animals killed in a proposed Winnipeg plant be tested for BSE.

Wowchuk was also named acting Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and Trade on May 18, 2004, following the resignation of Mary Ann Mihychuk. She retained this position until October 22, 2004.

Wowchuk was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. On July 4, 2011, she announced that she will not run in the next provincial election.

Wowchuk is not related to current Swan River MLA Rick Wowchuk, despite the fact that the two share the same surname.

<doc id="950517" wikidata="Q720113" url="?curid=950517" title="Barbarism (linguistics)">
<text>A barbarism is a nonstandard word, expression or pronunciation in a language, particularly one regarded as an error in morphology, while a &quot;solecism&quot; is an error in syntax. The label was originally applied to mixing Ancient Greek or Latin with other languages, but expanded to indicate any inappropriate words or expressions in classical studies and eventually to any language considered unpolished or rude. The term is used mainly for the written language.

With no accepted technical meaning in modern linguistics, the term is little used by contemporary descriptive scientists.

==Classical==
The word &quot;barbarism&quot; (Greek: βαρβαρισμός) was originally used by the Greeks for foreign terms used in their language and is related to the word &quot;barbarian&quot;.

The first Latin grammarian to use the word &quot;barbarolexis&quot; was Marius Plotius Sacerdos in the 3rd century AD. Cominianus provides a definition. Charisius, in the 4th century, clearly excluded Greek words from being considered barbarisms in Latin. According to Raija Vainio, &quot;if a word—either a Latin or a Greek one—was corrupted by an element from another language, this was a barbarolexis, a barbarous way of writing the word.&quot;

==English==
The earliest use of the word in English to describe inappropriate usage was in the 16th century to refer to mixing other languages with Latin or Greek, especially in texts treating classics. By the seventeenth century &quot;barbarism&quot; had taken on a more general, less precise sense of unsuitable language. In &quot;The History of Philosophy&quot;, for example, Thomas Stanley declared, &quot;Among the faults of speech is &quot;Barbarisme&quot;, a phrase not in use with the best persons, and &quot;Solecisme&quot;, a speech incoherently framed&quot; .

Hybrid words, which combine affixes or other elements borrowed from multiple languages, were sometimes decried as barbarisms. Thus, the authors of the &quot;Encyclopædia Metropolitana&quot; criticized the French word &quot;&quot; (&quot;linguistics&quot;) as &quot;more than ordinary barbarism, for the Latin substantive &quot;lingua&quot; is here combined, not merely with one, but with two Greek particles&quot;. Such mixing is &quot;casual and massive&quot; in modern English.

Although &quot;barbarism&quot; has no precise technical definition, the term is still used in non-technical discussions of language use to describe a word or usage as incorrect or nonstandard. Gallicisms (use of French words or idioms), Germanisms, Hispanisms, and so forth in English can be construed as examples of barbarisms, as can Anglicisms in other languages.

==Russian==
In the 18th and the 19th centuries, the Russian of the noble classes was severely &quot;barbarized&quot; by French. Speaking in French had become not only fashionable but also a sign of distinction of a properly groomed person. One may see a prominent example in Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;. While the cream of the high society could afford a genuine French &quot;gouvernante&quot; (governess, or female live-in tutor), the provincial &quot;upper class&quot; had problems. Still, the desire to show off their education produced what Aleksander Griboyedov&#x27;s &quot;Woe from Wit&quot; termed &quot;the mixture of the tongues: French with Nizhegorodian&quot; (смесь языков: французского с нижегородским). French-Nizhegorodian was often used for comical effect in literature and theatre.

<doc id="950519" wikidata="Q316898" url="?curid=950519" title="Benkei">
<text>, popularly known by the mononym Benkei, was a Japanese warrior monk (&quot;sōhei&quot;) who lived in the latter years of the Heian Period (794–1185). Benkei led a varied life, first becoming a monk, then a mountain ascetic, and then a rogue warrior. He later came to respect and serve the famous warrior Minamoto no Yoshitsune, also known as Ushiwakamaru. He is commonly depicted as a man of great strength and loyalty, and a popular subject of Japanese folklore showcased in many ancient and modern literature and productions.

The earliest records of Benkei are in the &quot;Azuma Kagami&quot;, &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;, and the &quot;Genpei Jōsuiki&quot;—all sources from around a century or more after Benkei&#x27;s life. These sources generally only indicate Benkei was one of Yoshitsune&#x27;s retainers and was a thin monk, although they do indicate Yoshitsune was aided and protected by a band of rogueish &quot;sōhei&quot; (warrior-monks) near Mount Hiei after he fled the capital—perhaps the historical core of the Benkei legend. Many of the detailed anecdotes and stories of Benkei are from the &quot;Gikeiki&quot;, an even later 14th-century work. As no contemporary records of Benkei are extant, it is difficult to know which elements of the stories are historical and which are embellished.

== Early life ==

Stories about Benkei&#x27;s birth vary considerably. One tells how his father was the head of a temple shrine who had raped his mother, the daughter of a blacksmith. Another sees him as the offspring of a temple god. Many give him the attributes of a demon, a monster child with wild hair and long teeth. In his youth, Benkei may have been called —&quot;demon/ogre child&quot;, and there are many famous ukiyo-e works themed on Oniwakamaru and his adventures. He is said to have defeated 200 men in each battle he was personally involved in.

Benkei chose to join the monastic establishment at an early age and traveled widely among the Buddhist monasteries of Japan. During this period, monasteries were not only important centers of administration and culture, but also military powers in their own right, similar to the Roman Legions. Like many other monks, Benkei was likely trained in the use of the &quot;naginata&quot;, the half-moon spear.

At the age of seventeen, Benkei was said to have been tall. At this point, he left the monasteries, and became a &quot;yamabushi&quot;, a member of a sect of mountain ascetics. Benkei was commonly depicted wearing a black cap that was a signature theme of such mountain ascetics.

==Seven weapons==
Benkei armed himself with seven weapons, and is often depicted carrying these on his back. In addition to his sword, he carried a broad axe (&quot;masakari&quot;), a rake (&quot;kumade&quot;), a sickle (&quot;nagigama&quot;), a wooden mallet (&quot;hizuchi&quot;), a saw (&quot;nokogiri&quot;), an iron staff (&quot;tetsubō&quot;), and a Japanese glaive (naginata).

==Career==

Benkei was said to have wandered around Kyoto every night on a personal quest to take 1000 swords from samurai warriors, who he believed were arrogant and unworthy. After collecting 999 swords through duels and looking for his final prize, he met a young man playing a flute at Gojotenjin Shrine in Kyoto. The much shorter man supposedly carried a gilded sword around his waist. Instead of dueling at the shrine itself, the two walked to Gojo Bridge in the city where the bigger Benkei ultimately lost to the smaller warrior, who happened to be Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a son of Minamoto no Yoshitomo. Some sources claim that the fight took place not at the Gojo Bridge, but instead at Matsubara Bridge. Not long after the duel, Benkei, frustrated and looking for revenge, waited for Yoshitsune at the Buddhist temple of Kiyomizu, where he lost yet again. Henceforth, he became Yoshitsune&#x27;s retainer and fought with him in the Genpei War against the Taira clan.

From 1185 until his death in 1189, Benkei accompanied Yoshitsune as an outlaw.

==Death==
In the end, Benkei and Yoshitsune were encircled in the castle of &quot;Koromogawa no tate&quot;. As Yoshitsune retired to the inner keep of the castle to commit honorable ritual suicide (&quot;seppuku&quot;) on his own, Benkei stood guard on the bridge in front of the main gate to protect Yoshitsune. It is said that the soldiers were afraid to cross the bridge to confront him, and that all who did met a swift death at the hands of the gigantic man, who killed in excess of 300 trained soldiers.

Realizing that close combat would mean suicide, the warriors following Minamoto no Yoritomo decided to shoot and kill Benkei with arrows instead. Long after the battle should have been over, the soldiers noticed that the arrow-riddled, wound-covered Benkei was still standing. When the soldiers dared to cross the bridge and take a closer look, the heroic warrior fell to the ground, having died standing upright. This is known as the &quot;Standing Death of Benkei&quot; (, &quot;Benkei no Tachi Ōjō&quot;). Benkei died at the age of 34.

Atago-do, now called Benkei-do, features a statue of Benkei six feet two inches in height in the posture he stood in when he died at Koromogawa. It was built in the era of Shotoku (1711–1716), replacing an older monument. In olden times the Benkei-do was at the foot of Chusonji hill until it was demolished. The ruins and a single pine tree still remain.

<text>Figure skating at the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] took place at the Olympic Ice Rink in St. Moritz, Switzerland, between 14 and 19 February 1928. Three figure skating events were contested: men&#x27;s singles, ladies&#x27; singles, and pair skating.

Unseasonably warm weather in St. Moritz during the Games caused difficulty for the figure skating events, as the ice surface was outdoors. There was a proposal to move the competition to an indoor rink in Berlin or London, but colder weather returned before a decision could be made. However, the ice surface remained in poor condition for the duration of the Games. During the ladies&#x27; free skating, red flags were placed on the ice to mark the especially bad areas, which became more numerous as the competition progressed.

<doc id="950542" wikidata="Q2219178" url="?curid=950542" title="Samyaza">
<text>Samyaza ( &quot;Šamməḥăzay&quot;; &quot;Šəmīʿāzāʾ&quot;; ; , &#x27;), alsoShamhazai,AzaorOuza, is a fallen angel of apocryphal Abrahamic traditions and Manichaeism as the leader of the Watchers.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Shemyaza(z)&quot; means &quot;the (or my) name has seen,&quot; &quot;he sees the name,&quot; or &quot;I have seen.&quot; It is also spelled &quot;Samyaza&quot;, &quot;Shemhazai&quot;, &quot;Samiaza(z)&quot;, &quot;Semiaza&quot;, &quot;Shamazya&quot;, &quot;Shemyazaz&quot;, &quot;Shemihazah&quot;, &quot;Shemyaza&quot;, &quot;Sêmîazâz&quot;, &quot;Semjâzâ&quot;, &quot;Samjâzâ&quot;, &quot;Šemihaza&quot;, and &quot;Semyaza&quot;.

The scholars lean towards the Semitic etymology of this appellation which contains the letters &quot;shin&quot; (ש) and &quot;mem&quot; (מ), thus suggesting the derivation from either “name” (Heb. שם, &quot;shem&quot;) or “heavens” (Heb. שמים, &quot;shamaym&quot;). Moshe Idel proposed that Samyaza is the one who “gazes at heavens” or “gazes from heavens”. This interpretation goes well with the motif of the heavenly Watchers, i.e., the angels supervising humans on earth.

==Book of Enoch==
In the Book of Enoch, one of the apocryphal writings, Samyaza is portrayed as the leader of a band of angels called &quot;sons of God&quot; or &quot;Watchers&quot; (&quot;grigori&quot; in Greek).

Samyaza is introduced in Book 6, heading a meeting of a total of 200 angels, wherein they discuss their desire to consummate with human women:

Samyaza and his fellow Watchers then each take human women for wives and bestow knowledge upon them. The children born from these partnerships are known as Nephilim, a plural noun rendered as &quot;giants&quot; in the King James translation of the Book of Genesis. The Nephilim &quot;consumed all the acquisitions of men. And when men could no longer sustain them, the giants turned against them and devoured mankind.&quot; (:3-5)

In Book 10, God commands the angel Gabriel to cause the Watchers and Nephilim to wage civil war, after the completion of which he condemns Samyaza to be &quot;[bound] fast for seventy generations in the valleys of the earth, till the day of their judgement and of their consummation, till the judgement that is for ever and ever is consummated. In those days they shall be led off to the abyss of fire: and 14 to the torment and the prison in which they shall be confined for ever.&quot; (:11-14)

==Book of Giants==
In The Book of Giants, Shemyaza (or &quot;Šahmīzād&quot; in the Manichaean version) begets two sons, who together battle Leviathan. However, they are not portrayed as heroic, but as boasting about their own victory; a symbol of royal failure to keep one&#x27;s power in this world. After the defeat of the Leviathan, Shemyaza and his offspring are slain by the four punishing angels.

== Babylonian Talmud ==
The Babylonian Talmud contains a singular mention of the name Samyaza (spelled שמחזאי in the Vilna edition with some lesser variations in the manuscripts) in Niddah 61a. Accordingly:

The text does not elucidate the identity of Samyaza who appears nowhere else in the corpus, but clearly portrays him as the grandfather of Og, the king of Bashan and the last of Rephaim known for his gigantic height and strength (Deuteronomy 3:11). As such this can be taken as a reference to the myth of the fallen angels and the motif of their gigantic progeny transmitted in apocrypha and pseudepigrapha.

==Other traditions==
In legend, Azza (another name for Samyaza) is the seraph tempted by the maiden Ishtar to reveal to her the Explicit Name of God. In Solomonic lore, the story is that Azza was the angel who revealed to the Jewish king the heavenly arcana, thus making Solomon the wisest man on earth. Of the two groups of angels headed by Metatron, one of the groups, the angels of justice, were under the rulership of Azza, who at this time had not yet fallen.

Azza, according to the rabbinic tradition, is suspended between Heaven and Earth along with Azazel as punishment for having had carnal knowledge of mortal women. He is said to be constantly falling, with one eye shut and the other open, to see his plight and suffer the more. It is said that he now hangs, head down, and is the constellation of Orion.

Uzza (said to be another name for Samyaza) is the tutelary angel of the Egyptians.

Before the fall, Ouza (said to be another name for Samyaza) was of the rank of Seraphim.

<text>Aristocrat Records, sometimes billed as the Aristocrat of Records, was founded in April 1947 by Charles and Evelyn Aron, together with their partners Fred and Mildred Brount and Art Spiegel. By September, Leonard Chess had invested in the young record company. Over time, Leonard bought the others out, and by 1948, only he and Evelyn Aron ran the firm. By early 1950, Leonard and his brother Phil had become the sole owners, and in June of that year they changed the company&#x27;s name from Aristocrat to Chess Records. The Aristocrat brand was officially discontinued in January 1951.

In three years, Aristocrat released 183 songs, and recorded 18 more that were released under the new Chess label.

On August 27, 1947, Muddy Waters made his first recordings for Aristocrat, which produced the single &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; b/w &quot;Little Anna Mae&quot;. Backing him were bassist Ernest &quot;Big&quot; Crawford and pianist Sunnyland Slim. After a second session in December 1947, Aristocrat released &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Satisfied&quot; b/w &quot;Feel Like Goin&#x27; Home,&quot; which became a minor hit.

<doc id="950565" wikidata="Q2195800" url="?curid=950565" title="Spartacus (Triumvirat album)">
<text>Spartacus is the third album by the German group Triumvirat. It is a concept album based on Spartacus, the Thracian gladiator who led the 3rd slave uprising in 73–71 BC. The lyrics were written by Hans Bathelt, with contributions by Jürgen Fritz. It was originally released in 1975 on the EMI label, and later distributed in the U.S. by Capitol. It debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts.

After this album, Helmut Köllen left the band to start a solo career. Two years later, he died of carbon monoxide poisoning when he was in his car, in the garage, listening to his own compositions on the car&#x27;s cassette player.

The album was digitally re-mastered and released in CD form in 2002 by EMI. The re-mastered version included two additional tracks: a live version of &quot;The Capital of Power&quot; and a previously unreleased song called &quot;Showstopper&quot;.

<doc id="950572" wikidata="Q7490258" url="?curid=950572" title="Sharon Watts">
<text>Sharon Watts (also Mitchell, Rickman, and Beale) is a fictional character from the BBC One soap opera, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, played by Letitia Dean. Sharon was one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ original characters conceptualised by creators Tony Holland and Julia Smith. She first appeared in the very first episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, broadcast on 19 February 1985, as the adopted teenage daughter of Walford&#x27;s The Queen Victoria public house landlords Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson). Dean originally quit the role in 1995, following the breakdown of Sharon&#x27;s marriage to Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp).

In May 2001, Sharon was reintroduced by producer John Yorke, before departing again in January 2006. Dean&#x27;s second return was announced in February 2012, and she later made her on-screen return on 13 August 2012, in a special week of episodes involving her wedding day to John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall) and Grant&#x27;s nephew Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe) being arrested for killing Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison). Sharon has been a regular character since, but Dean took a temporary break from the soap in early 2024, with Sharon departing on 9 January and returning on 1 April.

Sharon became a prominent character in the 1990s due to her becoming the landlady of the Queen Vic pub and her romantic pairings with brothers Grant and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). In a storyline dubbed &quot;Sharongate&quot;, Sharon married Grant, but began an affair with Phil, climaxing in 1994 with Grant&#x27;s discovery of the affair, which remains one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;″ highest viewed episodes. The storyline was reinvented in 2018 when Sharon, now married to Phil, began an affair with the much-younger Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters).

In Dean&#x27;s second &quot;EastEnders&quot; stint, beginning in 2001, Sharon&#x27;s storylines included a feud with Phil and Grant&#x27;s mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor); the return of her father Den, who had been long-thought dead, bonding with Den&#x27;s wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) who would later murder him in retribution for sleeping with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan); and a forbidden relationship with Den&#x27;s son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman), which culminated in his death after the spouses incited the wrath of local gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) leading to Sharon&#x27;s 2006 departure.

Since 2012, Sharon&#x27;s storylines have featured an ill-fated engagement to Jack Branning (Scott Maslen); a painkiller addiction; a reunion and tempestuous marriage to Phil; being attacked in her own bar; meeting her biological father Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas); and an affair with Keanu Taylor, popularly dubbed &#x27;Sheanu&#x27;, which sparked a late in life pregnancy, Sharon&#x27;s split and divorce from Phil, and the birth of son Albie (believed to be Keanu&#x27;s son) on the same night her other son, Dennis Jr., dies in a boat accident involving to Phil, his son Ben (Max Bowden), Keanu, and Sharon&#x27;s friend, and Phil&#x27;s former stepson, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt).

In 2020, struggling to cope with Dennis&#x27; death, Sharon attempts suicide before becoming the landlady of The Queen Vic once again. As part of her revenge plan upon finding out Ian&#x27;s role in her son&#x27;s demise, Sharon marries Ian and attempts to murder him through poisoning. However, she realises she cannot murder her friend of over three decades, and she lets him go. After this, Sharon discovers that she has a half-brother, Zack Hudson (James Farrar). She has a fling with Kheerat Panesar (Jaz Deol), and finds out she has a granddaughter, Alyssa.

In December 2022, Keanu returns to Walford and he and Sharon reunite and get engaged. Sharon deals with Albie&#x27;s kidnap, unaware that Keanu has orchestrated it, and she also learns that Albie is not Keanu&#x27;s son after all, but Phil&#x27;s. The storyline culminates with Keanu&#x27;s death on Christmas Day 2023 after Sharon jilts him at the altar after learning of his role in Albie&#x27;s kidnap, and reveals that Keanu is not Albie&#x27;s father. Keanu almost kills Sharon before her best friend Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) stabs him to defend her during &quot;The Six&quot; storyline. In 2024, Sharon deals with the grief of losing Keanu which leads to her being in prison, bumping into her former stepmother Chrissie, after framing Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) with the help of The Six, and developing a relationship with Phil and Grant&#x27;s relative, Teddy Mitchell (Roland Manookian).

Sharon was named the best &quot;EastEnders&quot; character of all time by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2020. For her portrayal of Sharon, Dean won the British Soap Award for Outstanding Achievement at the 2022 British Soap Awards.

==Creation==
=== Background ===
Sharon Watts was one of the original twenty-three characters conceived by the creators of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. She was originally to be named Tracey, and she and her parents were to be the occupants of the soap&#x27;s local pub, now known as The Queen Vic. Holland, who had worked as a barman in his youth, called upon his own personal experiences to invent the Watts family and the pub they lived in. Holland and Smith had always been critical of the way pubs had been portrayed on television, feeling they lacked vitality and life, so they were determined that their pub and occupants were going to be more &quot;real&quot;. The Watts were seen by Holland as integral to the show&#x27;s success, partly because he had already guessed that the pub was going to be a monstrous battleground where emotions would run high on a regular basis, and also because the occupants would be providing the majority of the drama. Sharon&#x27;s original character outline, as written by Smith and Holland, appeared in an abridged form in their 1987 book, &quot;EastEnders: The Inside Story&quot;. In this passage, Sharon is referred to as Tracey and her parents as Jack and Pearl (known now as Den and Angie).

===Casting===
Although Sharon was meant to be fourteen, licensing regulations required the cast actress to be a sixteen-year-old who could &quot;play down.&quot; Holland and Smith were looking for a &quot;bouncy, attractive, oddly vulnerable young woman&quot; who would come across as slightly more sophisticated than the character of Michelle Fowler, due to be Sharon&#x27;s closest peer. Out of the various applicants they had seen, they felt only actress Letitia Dean had all of the qualities they were looking for. As the casting directors were only looking for real East End actors, Dean falsely claimed that she was born and raised in Hackney, east London. The lie paid off and she got the part, clinching the deal because of her laugh, which Holland and Smith have described as &quot;the dirtiest in the world!&quot;

Reflecting on her casting, Dean told the magazine, &quot;Woman&quot;, in 2005: &quot;I was 16 when we started filming &quot;EastEnders&quot; and my contract was initially for eight weeks—none of us had any idea it would go on for so long. I nearly fainted when I saw Wendy Richard [who played Pauline Fowler] for the first time, because she was a really big name and I was in awe of her. Anita Dobson who played Angie Watts, [Sharon&#x27;s] mum, took me under her wing.&quot; In the early days of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, it was in Letitia Dean&#x27;s contract that she was not allowed to lose any weight.

=== Characterisation ===
Described by the BBC as &quot;slightly spoilt, over-dramatic, blousy, but ultimately kind-hearted&quot;, Sharon has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of &quot;EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square&quot;, as a &quot;drama queen&quot;, a &quot;strong passionate [woman] who [goes] to pieces where men are concerned and always [comes] back for more&quot;. Early on in her narrative, Sharon was depicted as a mixed-up individual, torn between her warring parents, but spoilt by both; the British press dubbed her &quot;Den&#x27;s princess&quot;, an indication of her spoilt upbringing. Scriptwriter Colin Brake suggested that because of the dysfunctional marriage of her adoptive parents, &quot;Sharon was a fairly troubled teenager. Set apart from the other kids because Den and Angie sent her to private school rather than the local comprehensive, she was a bit of a loner. Spoilt rotten by both her parents, Den&#x27;s &#x27;little princess&#x27; was really a little madam.&quot;

As the character progressed into her 20s, she underwent some changes. Colin Brake suggested that, following the discovery of Den&#x27;s (wrongly identified) body in 1990, it was &quot;time for Den&#x27;s princess to grow up&quot;. In 1993, Letitia Dean discussed the evolution of Sharon from teenager to adult: &quot;She&#x27;s grown up a lot. Once she got into her stride she got quite strong—not hard, but knew what she wanted.&quot; Matthew Bayliss, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, suggested that Sharon developed into a character that was simultaneously &quot;vamp and victim&quot;, comparing her to another popular soap opera character from ITV&#x27;s &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix).

In 1991, author Hilary Kingsley compared Sharon in adulthood to her mother Angie: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of her mother in Sharon Watts. There is the warm sympathy and the barbed tongue for a kick-off. But Sharon is more sensible than Angie, less likely to fly off the beer handle in The Vic.&quot; Letitia Dean suggested that Sharon was trying to establish her own personality as landlady of The Vic in 1993, but that she was also taking tips from Angie, whom she &quot;admired for her strength of character.&quot; In the 1990s, the producers of &quot;EastEnders&quot; wanted to take the similarities between Sharon and Angie one step further; they proposed that Sharon would begin drinking gin, the favourite beverage of her alcoholic mother. Dean was opposed to this development and persuaded the producers not to go down this route with Sharon. In 1993, she explained her reasons: &quot;There was one time they wanted [Sharon] to drink gin because that was Angie&#x27;s tipple, but I thought that was wrong. Her mother was on a dialysis machine which would have put Sharon off gin for life. She would either follow right behind her or she would make her mind up and say no. And since she had seen Angie in such a state, it really put her off.&quot; Sharon has been described as a &quot;buxom femme fatale&quot; and one of &quot;life&#x27;s survivors&quot;, who has had &quot;many moments of emotional turmoil&quot;. Kingsley suggested that despite this, Sharon is &quot;a sensitive, vulnerable girl who is easily hurt. Even so, that doesn&#x27;t stop her going after something that she really wants [...] Sharon came through to become a nice girl behind the streetwise image [...] with her blonde hair and bright make-up she adds a cheerful touch to drab Albert Square.&quot;

Television critic Matt Bayliss, discussed the psychology of Sharon in 2010: &quot;She had a terrible childhood. An alcoholic mother and a father she adored but who treated her mother appallingly. She had a very long subsequent career on the show, falling for the wrong bloke and not realising her own worth. You could see that the way she turned was directly related to her beginnings, to that difficult family situation.&quot;

Sharon has topped numerous viewer polls suggesting she is one of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; most favored characters. Critics have praised the character&#x27;s complex progression from teenager to adult, referencing the investment that viewers hold in Sharon, having watched her grow up on-screen. While Sharon&#x27;s returns to &quot;EastEnders&quot; have been welcomed by some critics, others received her comebacks as an indication that the show&#x27;s writers and producers had run out of original ideas. Letitia Dean has defended the decision to reintroduce Sharon, suggesting that long-running dramas such as &quot;EastEnders&quot; need &quot;old blood&quot;. On 10 April 2019, Dean filmed her 2000th episode as Sharon.

== Development ==
=== Early storylines (1985–1990) ===
An early controversial storyline involving Sharon revolved around her desire to take contraceptive pills to persuade Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford) to date her. According to Holland and Smith, this storyline caused tremendous interest in the UK. Holland and Smith have suggested that it was a daring issue to tackle in the 1980s, as it involved a girl under sixteen, and was to be aired at a time when the issue was prominent in British society. Holland and Smith suggested that people took sides with the issue and Sharon&#x27;s dilemma became a debate used as a teaching method, both in schools and at home. The creators stated that many families admitted that, as a result of Sharon&#x27;s storyline, they were discussing taboo topics openly in their homes for the first time in years, or ever.

Sharon went on to feature in a storyline about the ups and downs of a pop group called The Banned in 1986. It featured the majority of teenage characters in the soap at the time. The storyline proved to be a successful merchandising tool for the serial, as it spawned two hit singles in the UK charts. One of the songs &quot;Something Outa Nothing&quot;, which was performed on-screen in the plot, was released by actors Letitia Dean and Paul J. Medford. The song was a modest success, reaching number 12 in the UK singles chart in November 1986. The storyline was seen as an interesting and major undertaking in the serial, but one that Holland and Smith felt never entirely worked.

In her teenage years, Sharon&#x27;s main storylines depicted the plight of a young woman struggling to find her identity while growing up in a broken home and coping with her mother&#x27;s alcoholism and her father&#x27;s infidelities. Anita Dobson, who played Sharon&#x27;s mother Angie, discussed Sharon and Angie&#x27;s relationship, suggesting that Angie was not a good mother: &quot;I think someone handed Sharon over to her one day, and Angie thought of her like this glistening Christmas present. I think she never really thought it through beforehand. I do believe she really wanted a child and she loved Sharon, but eventually found the competition pretty difficult to deal with in regard to Den&#x27;s attentions. She was pretty rough on Sharon because of her drinking.&quot; Sally Vincent, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has pontificated about the dynamics of Sharon&#x27;s relationship with both her parents in 2001. She suggested that viewers felt sorry for Sharon &quot;because not only had her [birth] mother given her away, but her adoptive parents were the legendary Dirty Den and the feckless Angie, erstwhile landlord and lady of The Queen Vic, who were always too busy being dirty and feckless, in our opinion, to take proper care of their little girl. We knew enough about family psychology to know that all those presents they lavished upon her were no substitute for presence. We knew what neglect and emotional absence can do to a growing girl.&quot; David Buckingham, in his 1987 book &quot;Public Secrets: EastEnders and its audience&quot;, analysed the relationship between Sharon and her parents, suggesting that teenage Sharon was suspended between childhood and adulthood. He reflected that Den frequently referred to her as &quot;just a child&quot;, but that Sharon herself sought to assert her status as an adult, describing her parents as &quot;immature&quot; or &quot;childish&quot;. In character dialogue, Sharon suggested that Den had tried to keep his wife Angie in the role of a baby, but that he himself was a child, stating &quot;I behave more like an adult that you&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. During this period, Sharon was shown to question her parents&#x27; capability to offer her advice, and both Den and Angie had difficulty refuting her arguments. In one episode Sharon questioned, &quot;How come you two always know what&#x27;s best for me? You haven&#x27;t exactly made a good job of your own lives!&quot;

Sharon was shown to share a particularly close friendship with Michelle Fowler in the serial. Kingsley suggested that Michelle was an &quot;important steadying influence in Sharon&#x27;s life. The two friends are like sisters and, like sisters, they sometimes fight.&quot; Following Den&#x27;s supposed death in 1989, Sharon and Michelle&#x27;s friendship was tested by Sharon&#x27;s discovery that her adored father had slept with her best friend Michelle when she was sixteen and that he was the mystery father of Michelle&#x27;s daughter, Vicki. Sharon discovered this in a special two-hander episode written by Tony McHale, which aired in April 1989. In the episode, Sharon and Michelle spend an evening together drinking wine and reminiscing. After Sharon confesses to Michelle that, in the absence of both her parents, she now views Michelle and her daughter Vicki as her family, Michelle tells her the secret she has been keeping for four years, that Vicki is Den&#x27;s daughter. However, Sharon is not comforted by this, feeling &quot;hurt, angry and deceived&quot; by Michelle and her father. Brake surmised that Sharon &quot;leaves the flat wishing that Michelle had never told her. Things would never be quite the same between them.&quot; The episode returned to a model established by the first Den-and-Angie solo episode, with revelations and major character changes to an important relationship. Brake suggested that it gave Dean and Susan Tully (Michelle) the chance to demonstrate how much they had grown as actresses during their four years on the programme. Brake also claimed the episode was held in high regard by the show&#x27;s producers, directors, and writers, describing the actors&#x27; performances as &quot;superlative&quot;.

=== Relationship with Phil and Grant Mitchell (&quot;Sharongate&quot;) ===

The arrival of the Mitchell brothers in 1990 heralded a new era for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, but also for Sharon. Brothers Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) were introduced by executive producer Michael Ferguson, as he wanted to bring in a couple of young men who would bring an air of danger to the show. Both the Mitchell brothers would prove to be extremely important for Sharon in the following years, most notably when she married one brother, then had an affair with the other.

Sharon and Grant&#x27;s relationship began in 1990 and by 1991, the couple were installed as the owners of the soap opera&#x27;s focal establishment, The Queen Victoria public house, Sharon&#x27;s childhood home. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has stated that the decision to promote Sharon from barmaid to landlady of The Vic in 1991 stemmed from discussion about the character&#x27;s long-term future in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. It was felt that because Sharon was the daughter of Den and Angie, &quot;it seemed right that she should succeed them, at least for a time, in running The Vic&quot;. Holden suggested that the choice to give Sharon The Vic was part of the reason that her predecessor, licensee Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), was killed off in the serial.

19 million viewers tuned in on Boxing Day 1991 to witness Sharon and Grant&#x27;s surprise Christmas wedding. Their marriage was scripted to be volatile, with Grant resorting to violent displays when things did not go his way and endangering Sharon on numerous occasions due to his criminal dealings. Letitia Dean discussed Sharon&#x27;s attraction to Grant in 1993: &quot;Grant was quite flirtatious with [Sharon] when they first met and he made her feel quite good about herself. He promised to protect her and he promised her the world [...] She wouldn&#x27;t have gone for Grant if he was just a complete pain in the arse. There are obviously other qualities in him which is why she strives to keep [their relationship] going. There&#x27;s a lot of reminders — [Grant&#x27;s] not [Sharon&#x27;s father] Den, but he&#x27;s got a lot of characteristics that are pretty similar.&quot;

Despite the fact that Sharon married Grant in 1991, former &quot;EastEnders&quot; writer Tony Jordan has revealed in a documentary entitled &quot;The Mitchells — The Full Story&quot; that the love-triangle storyline between Grant, Sharon and Phil had been planned from the Mitchell brothers&#x27; introduction, after the writers came to the realisation that Sharon &quot;was perfect for both of them&quot;. The plot has been described by former Executive Producer of &quot;EastEnders&quot; and BBC&#x27;s Head of Drama Serials, John Yorke, as a &quot;Tristan and Isolde story&quot;. The storyline was spread out for several years and began with Sharon turning to Phil for comfort during a particularly turbulent part of her marriage to Grant. The episode in which Phil betrayed his brother with Sharon occurred in September 1992 in one of the soap&#x27;s notorious three-handers, an episode featuring only Sharon, Phil and Grant for the duration. Sue Dunderdale directed the episode and the performances of McFadden, Kemp and Dean have been described as memorable and filled with high-tension drama. Discussing Sharon&#x27;s feelings for Phil, Letitia Dean said: &quot;Phil was always around for Sharon. He seemed to understand her, and Sharon appreciated that. There&#x27;s always been something between them.&quot;

The storyline climaxed in October 1994 with some of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; most popular and renowned episodes, which have been dubbed &quot;Sharongate&quot;. The episodes centred around Grant&#x27;s discovery that his wife had been having an affair with his brother and they were watched by 25.3 million viewers. On-screen Grant heard Sharon unwittingly confessing to the affair on tape. He reacted by playing it to a pub full of people at Phil&#x27;s engagement party and then beat his brother unconscious.

The writer of Sharongate, Tony Jordan, has stated that of all the storylines he has penned for the soap, Sharongate is the one he is most proud of. He comments &quot;Three of the strongest characters that have ever been in &quot;EastEnders&quot; are the Mitchell brothers and Sharon [...] when we actually blew that story it was incredible [...] being able to reach that many people with your work is what makes &quot;EastEnders&quot; exciting.&quot; Reporter for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Sally Vincent, has commented on Sharongate&#x27;s success: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t so much the guilt-stacked, long-drawn-out business of Sharon &#x27;n&#x27; Phil&#x27;s helpless lust for each other—all that unseemly face-sucking while her hubby/his brother, the ape-like Grant, languished in gaol for trying to set fire to everyone—that broke the ratings record, nor was it the ingenious ruse of using the [DJ&#x27;s tape deck] to broadcast Sharon&#x27;s poignant little confession to the entire clientele of Walford&#x27;s Queen Vic [pub]. It was the fact that we&#x27;d all watched Sharon grow up. We knew that she was a nice little person, vulnerable, brave, sweet-natured and kind to the dog. We were sorry for her [...] Neither of those Mitchells deserved her, so when one punched the other and half-killed him for tampering with his lady-wife, we didn&#x27;t much care. We were sorry to see [Sharon] go.&quot;

Sharongate has proven to be a popular storyline with viewers. In 2001 it was voted the second &quot;Best Ever Soap Moment&quot; in an ITV televised poll, and it was voted the sixth top soap opera moment of all time in a poll of 17,000 people for &quot;What&#x27;s on TV&quot; magazine in 2003. In 2010, Michael Hogan from &quot;The Telegraph&quot; ranked it the sixth of the top ten &quot;unforgettable moments&quot; of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In a 2012 nationwide poll of 1,000 people published in &quot;Inside Soap&quot;, &#x27;Sharongate&#x27; was voted as the greatest soap opera moment of the past 20 years.

=== Departure (1995) ===
Letitia Dean decided to quit the role of Sharon in 1995, having played the character for over a decade. Dean was not the only original cast member to announce their departure that year; Susan Tully (Michelle Fowler) and Bill Treacher (Arthur Fowler) also quit, leaving just Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler), Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale), and Gillian Taylforth (Kathy Beale) as the only original cast remaining at that time. Dean, who was aged 26 at the time, has since reflected on her decision to leave, suggesting she went through an identity crisis when she found herself thinking &quot;who am I? Am I Sharon Watts or am I an actress?&quot;. Sally Vincent, interviewing Dean for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, surmised: &quot;it nagged away at [Dean] for ages until she thought, hell, she owed it to herself, and started telling the producers she&#x27;d been thinking about trying new things. In those days, they didn&#x27;t let you off for the odd panto or anything. It was full-time work. She remembers being dithery and apologetic about it, but her feet were itchy and, though she never really wanted to close the door behind her, she talked about going until one day, much to her consternation, [the producers] said all right then, off you go, lots of luck. They didn&#x27;t ask her to reconsider, so she thought, &#x27;Ooooh, charmin&#x27;, and off she went.&quot; Dean added, &quot;I felt the need to spread my wings and try my hand at other things. I didn&#x27;t want to feel there were parts out there I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to play. When I left I felt this mixture of excitement and fear. I went on the last walk with Susan Tully [who played Michelle Fowler] around the Square, talking quietly, and I felt quite sad. But at the same time it felt like the right thing to do.&quot;

Sharon&#x27;s exit on 6 July 1995 surrounded the continual fall-out from the Sharongate saga. 18 million viewers saw Grant bully Sharon into a divorce in the Christmas 1994 episodes; after a brief hiatus, she returned in 1995 for several months to gain revenge on Grant. The build-up for revenge saw Sharon coaxing Grant into making a public plea for marital reconciliation. However, as Thomas Sutcliffe writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; surmised, &quot;In the end, Sharon recoiled from the full horror of public humiliation in the Queen Vic and conducted a minor-key revenge on the pavement outside. For a while, there seemed a good chance that she was going to leave the series in an ambulance, but Grant kept his temper, so she simply climbed into a black cab, departing not with a bang but a whimper.&quot;

=== Reintroduction (2001) ===
The character was reintroduced to the show in 2001 by then producer John Yorke, almost six years after her initial departure. Discussing Yorke&#x27;s decision to reintroduce the character, a BBC spokesperson said, &quot;It&#x27;s the producer&#x27;s job to decide how the storylines are going to go, and he decided to bring Sharon back. And Letitia said she would love to come back.&quot; The producer&#x27;s decision to bring Sharon back reportedly shocked Dean, as she believed the time for a return had passed, particularly as Grant&#x27;s actor, Ross Kemp, had just left the series. She commented in a 1999 interview, &quot;I can&#x27;t see how the storyline would work. There&#x27;s only so much love a girl can have for the Queen Vic.&quot; However, when she saw the scripts for Sharon&#x27;s return, she was convinced.

Dean suggested that Sharon, who had passed 30 years of age on her return to the serial, wanted to get back to her roots and rediscover herself in Walford. Discussing her comeback, Dean said, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful opportunity to breathe life into Sharon again. I found out at Christmas [2000], so it was a fantastic present. Sharon has a great story to tell, having been away for so long. She has some unfinished business to sort out—and has some demons to face as well. I&#x27;ve always held Sharon&#x27;s character close to my heart. I always said: &#x27;Never say never&#x27;. There&#x27;s nothing worse than making a huge statement about never doing it again, and then going back [...] It was very exciting to be working with new cast members. But seeing members of the cast who I grew up with like Adam Woodyatt (Ian Beale), Todd Carty (Mark Fowler), Wendy Richard (Pauline Fowler) and Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) was just fantastic. It gave me some much-needed confidence and reassurance, knowing that I&#x27;d have that support.&quot; Sharon&#x27;s return episodes, which aired in May 2001, saw her shocking the Mitchell family by revealing herself as the anonymous buyer of her childhood home (the Vic pub). During the years since Sharon&#x27;s departure, the Queen Vic had remained in the Mitchells&#x27; ownership until Grant&#x27;s mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) was forced to sell it. Discussing Sharon&#x27;s return scenes, Dean said, &quot;Her appearance in the Vic is fabulous, and provokes some great reactions. Peggy is astonished, speechless and horrified all rolled into one. It&#x27;s landladies and their handbags at dawn.&quot; Sharon&#x27;s return was voted one of the top 100 TV moments of 2001 in a Channel 4 poll, and was chosen as the favourite soap comeback by almost one-third of viewers.

The return arc saw Sharon reuniting with her former lover, Phil. Discussing this, Dean said, &quot;[Sharon&#x27;s] tougher and seems to know what she wants. Seeing Phil throws up vivid memories and strong feelings for Sharon. She&#x27;s always had a deep affection for him&quot;. She added that because Sharon had grown and gained strength and independence while being in America, &quot;she can handle pretty much anything the Mitchells can throw at her&quot;. Their reunion lasted until December 2001, when various secrets, including Sharon&#x27;s confession that she believed she was infertile after aborting Grant&#x27;s baby, ended their romance.

=== Relationship with Tom Banks ===
In 2002, executive producer John Yorke introduced the character of Tom Banks (Colm Ó Maonlaí) as a love interest for Sharon. A love triangle storyline featured initially as Tom battled for Sharon&#x27;s affections with her former lover Phil Mitchell. In the storyline, Tom was shown to be keeping secrets from Sharon regarding his collapsed marriage, secrets that were unveiled by Phil; when Sharon confronted Tom, he admitted that he was still married, although he and his wife had split up.

In July 2002, following the introduction of a new executive producer, Louise Berridge, it was announced that Tom was being written out of &quot;EastEnders&quot;. A spokesperson denied that the actor had been fired, commenting, &quot;He was brought in to play out a specific storyline&quot; and that he was due to &quot;go out with a bang&quot;. According to &quot;The Mirror&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; bosses decided that there was nowhere else to go with the character, that they could not work out how to develop him and that he had fulfilled a specific role. Part of Tom&#x27;s exit storyline saw the character discovering that he had an inoperable brain tumour. Despite the initial upset this caused to his relationship with Sharon, the couple resolved to stay together and marry after Sharon proposed. Discussing Sharon&#x27;s impromptu proposal, a BBC spokesperson said, &quot;The two of them are messing one day and they decide to swap roles. Tom is supposed to do the washing and cleaning and Sharon takes on the role of a man. It is all supposed to be a joke but Sharon takes it to heart and shocks Tom when she arrives home with a ring and asks for his hand in marriage.&quot; However, in a plot twist, Tom was not killed off by the tumour; he instead died in a fire, airing in an episode that paid homage to Halloween, in October 2002. His death coincided with the exit of another character, Trevor Morgan (Alex Ferns). In the episode, Tom rushes into a house fire to save Trevor who is holding his baby and his ex-wife Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) hostage, but despite rescuing Mo and the baby, he and Trevor both die in an explosion.

=== Return of Den Watts ===
In 2003, producer Louise Berridge negotiated for Leslie Grantham to reprise the role of Sharon&#x27;s father Den, 14 years after his last appearance. Part of her motive for doing so was to bring Sharon, whom she described as one of her favourite characters, &quot;right back where she belonged, at the very heart of the show.&quot; The character Den had supposedly been killed in 1989 and a body found the following year had been identified as his, so the programme-makers needed to make certain that his return could be plausibly explained. A research team was employed to scour over past episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; to make certain that his return storyline would not have been going against anything that had been shown prior, or that could not have been &quot;faked&quot;. In an interview with Walford Web, Berridge discussed how her researchers discovered that there were inconsistencies in the episodes that aired during 1989 and 1990, that could account for Den&#x27;s death being staged. She commented, &quot;A great deal was made in the show of Den&#x27;s [signet] ring turning up [as proof that he died]—but if you watch the episode of the shooting you&#x27;ll see he isn&#x27;t even wearing it at the time of his supposed death. So how did it get in the canal?&quot;. Berridge&#x27;s writers concocted a story whereby the body that was recovered in 1990 was misidentified as Den&#x27;s; Den fled to Spain to escape the mobsters and allowed his family to believe he was dead until he was traced in 2003.

Den&#x27;s return aired in September 2003, with Den walking into Sharon&#x27;s club &quot;Angie&#x27;s Den&quot; (named after her parents) and uttering the greeting &quot;Hello princess&quot; to his daughter. Scriptwriter Sarah Phelps, who penned Den&#x27;s return, has discussed the episodes in the televised documentary &quot;EastEnders Revealed: Dirty Den Returns&quot;: &quot;It all had to kick off in Angie&#x27;s Den because this is the thing that Sharon has built [in] memory of her parents [...] the way she&#x27;s worshipped them in their death in a way that she couldn&#x27;t deal with them when they were alive [...] there&#x27;s a lot of really confused and emotional stuff [for Sharon]&quot;. Letitia Dean has discussed Sharon&#x27;s reaction to Den&#x27;s comeback: &quot;Sharon put her father on such a pedestal, when she found out that he had been alive for all those years and never contacted her — once — it absolutely devastated her, it rocked her world [...] She couldn&#x27;t believe that he would be so selfish because she was his princess.&quot; Leslie Grantham suggested that the one person Den loved more than himself was Sharon and that she was the reason he came back to Walford after 14 years. Part of Den&#x27;s return episodes featured a 20-page scene between Sharon and Den, played out in their former home, The Queen Vic. The director required that this scene be filmed all at once, which Dean has described as daunting but exciting. She believed that the long scene helped build realistic tension greatly because both she and Grantham were so nervous about working together again.

Further discussing Sharon&#x27;s ambivalent reaction to her father&#x27;s return Dean said, &quot;Sharon is absolutely dumbstruck at seeing her father again. It&#x27;s like seeing a ghost and she&#x27;s completely shocked. To see him after all this time when she had accepted his death and got on with her life, is too much for her. Sharon has been through so much in the past 14 years without Den and has had to cope on her own. Although she&#x27;s pleased to see him, he knows nothing of the life she&#x27;s had in his absence—he hasn&#x27;t been there for all the times she&#x27;s been hurt, like when she was caring for [her dying mother] Angie, or when her fiancé Tom died. She&#x27;s developed as a woman, and for her, their relationship ended when he &#x27;died&#x27; while she was still a teenager. Everything has been turned upside down for her. She&#x27;s feeling angry and resentful [towards] Den at the moment, but that&#x27;s only because she loved him so much. He&#x27;s going to have to tread so carefully with her—he&#x27;s got some real making up to do in order to enable Sharon to trust him again.&quot; Despite initial animosity and hurt, Sharon eventually welcomes Den back into her life and allows him to return to live with her, resuming head of the Watts dynasty.

=== Relationship with Dennis Rickman (&quot;Shannis&quot;) ===
As a precursor to Den&#x27;s return and as part of producer Louise Berridge&#x27;s plan to rebuild the Watts family, Den&#x27;s estranged son Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) was introduced to &quot;EastEnders&quot; earlier in 2003. A &quot;forbidden love&quot; storyline was built into Sharon&#x27;s narrative, when she embarked on a relationship with Dennis despite him being the son of her adoptive father. Scenes in which Sharon and Dennis succumb to their lust for each other had to be re-edited as the programme&#x27;s producers deemed them too raunchy to be shown before the 9pm watershed on BBC1. Discussing the scenes, Harman said, &quot;My character Dennis has been through most of the ladies on the square. But his latest encounter with Sharon is something else. There&#x27;s lots of banging around as we are ripping each other&#x27;s clothes off while staggering round the flat. There&#x27;s also quite a lot of flesh in the post-coital scene! It might shock a few people as she&#x27;s [Dennis&#x27;s] sister—not blood sister, though. Bosses had to tone it down and cut a couple of passionate embraces out.&quot; According to Harman, Dennis&#x27;s feelings for Sharon transcended anything Dennis had felt for women before her.

Den&#x27;s opposition to his children&#x27;s on/off romance was a reoccurring theme in the serial throughout 2004. The plot was the focus of the Christmas Day 2004 episodes when Dennis and Sharon announce they have reunited despite Dennis being in a simultaneous relationship with Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan). The fall-out, which sees Den persuading Zoe to tell Dennis she is expecting his baby, results in Sharon leaving Dennis. Discussing the storyline, Michelle Ryan said, &quot;Den forces her to say that she&#x27;s pregnant because he knows Dennis won&#x27;t run away with Sharon if he thinks there&#x27;s a baby on the way. Den completely manipulates the whole thing and Zoe finds herself trapped in the lie because she can&#x27;t seek advice from anyone. She didn&#x27;t dream up this silly situation—it was Den who told her to fabricate the story to save their relationship. It was his idea all along. Zoe still wants Dennis, even if he is in love with Sharon. She&#x27;s obsessed with him and can&#x27;t let go. She just wants to salvage the relationship and hasn&#x27;t even thought about putting the past behind them. Dennis is still not totally convinced, but he always swore he would never leave a child without a dad so he hopes that it will work for them in the future.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Owen Gibson suggested that with the Christmas Day 2004 episodes &quot;EastEnders&quot; were attempting to reprise the trick that garnered the show its biggest ever audience in 1986 of 30.6 million, by gathering the Watts family together for a festive altercation. 12.3 million people tuned in to watch Sharon leave Walford without Dennis in the aftermath; it was the highest viewed television programme of the day.

Dennis and Sharon eventually returned to the serial as a couple in the summer of 2005 having reunited off-screen, neither aware that Den has been murdered by his scorned second wife Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) in their absence. Den&#x27;s murder storyline aired to celebrate &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; 20th anniversary plot in February 2005 and featured Sharon discovering the truth about Den&#x27;s duplicity; it attracted 14 million viewers. Prominent in Sharon and Dennis&#x27;s return arc was their marriage and involvement in uncovering Chrissie as Den&#x27;s killer after Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) was originally charged with the murder. The Rickmans&#x27; wedding was watched by over 10 million viewers, and the nuptials were scripted to coincide with the discovery of Den&#x27;s body, which had been buried in the Vic&#x27;s cellar.

=== Departure (2006): Dennis&#x27;s murder ===
In August 2005, the BBC announced that both Letitia Dean and Nigel Harman were quitting their roles as Sharon and Dennis, with both due to film their final scenes for a New Year&#x27;s departure. While Harman&#x27;s exit was reported as permanent, Dean&#x27;s was reported as an &quot;extended break&quot;, with the suggestion being that she would be returning to the soap opera at some unspecified stage. Discussing the departure, Harman said, &quot;Sharon and Dennis have had such a great run, but what would you do with them next? I could pretty much guarantee we&#x27;ve already done it. It was something that was talked about over a period of time between myself and the producers.&quot; Harman added, &quot;I think it would be weird to have one there without the other and we&#x27;ve taken it as far as we can go. I think [the exit storyline will] be quite juicy but I&#x27;m waiting to find out. I&#x27;d like it to be a happy storyline, like Sharon and Dennis going off around the world. Although obviously, she&#x27;ll have to come back on her own going, &#x27;What a [bastard]&#x27;.&quot;

Despite Sharon discovering that she was pregnant with Dennis&#x27;s child on Christmas Day 2005, the Rickman&#x27;s were not given a happy ending. Writers made the decision to kill Dennis in the New Year&#x27;s Eve episode of 2005. In the episode Dennis was fatally stabbed on the Albert Square pavement following a violent altercation with gangster Johnny Allen, having been informed by Phil Mitchell that Johnny had throttled Sharon. The aftermath saw Sharon struggling with her grief and the realisation that she would be bringing her baby up fatherless. Discussing Sharon&#x27;s grief at Dennis&#x27;s funeral, Letitia Dean told &quot;Inside Soap&quot; in 2006 &quot;It&#x27;s an incredibly traumatic day for Sharon, she&#x27;s lost her soulmate. It&#x27;s especially devastating because she&#x27;s pregnant, which, as far as she and Dennis were concerned, was a miracle. It&#x27;s such a bittersweet time. The pain is overwhelming when Sharon sees her husband&#x27;s coffin [...] Sharon knows that she has to carry on for the baby&#x27;s sake—it&#x27;s a part of Dennis she&#x27;ll have forever, and she takes great comfort in that. As far as Johnny&#x27;s concerned, though, she wants to see justice done—a job she entrusts to Phil. However, all he&#x27;s interested in is getting Sharon away from Walford. He&#x27;s genuinely worried for her welfare, but he&#x27;s also petrified she&#x27;ll discover his role in Dennis&#x27;s death.&quot; In the storyline, Phil persuades Sharon to leave Walford to stay in America, in an episode which aired in January 2006.

Despite initial reports suggesting that Dean would only be taking a break from &quot;EastEnders&quot; and subsequent rumours indicating that Sharon would return for the birth of her child later in 2006, it was announced in June 2006 that there were no immediate plans for Sharon to return but that the birth of her baby would be announced on-screen later that year.

=== Reintroduction (2012) ===
On 2 February 2012, it was announced that Dean would reprise the role of Sharon after more than six years away. Dean said &quot;I am really looking forward to being part of the &quot;EastEnders&quot; team again, as it has always been very close to my heart. I cannot wait to work with my old colleagues and see what is in store for Sharon.&quot; Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said he was thrilled that Dean was returning and he could not wait to see Sharon on screen later in the year. Kirkwood had previously told a columnist for &quot;Inside Soap&quot; that in Sharon&#x27;s absence, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) had filled the role of the &quot;quivery lipped blonde&quot; female. Tabloid newspapers claimed Sharon was returning to &quot;fill the gap&quot; left behind by Jessie Wallace&#x27;s character, Kat Slater, who at the time was on a hiatus. However, an &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; spokesperson said &quot;There is no link between Letitia&#x27;s return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; and Jessie not being around at the moment. We have been working on plans to bring Sharon back for quite some time.&quot; They added viewers could look forward to seeing both characters on screen together later in the year.

Dean returned to filming on 6 June 2012. Sharon&#x27;s return storyline saw her fiancé John (Jesse Birdsall) kidnap her son Dennis Rickman Jnr following a &quot;furious bust up&quot;. Sharon enlisted the help former lover Phil to retrieve her son. Sharon returned to EastEnders on 13 August 2012. Sharon&#x27;s return storyline was marked with seven episodes being broadcast over a period of a week (the typical weekly output at this time was four) and it coincided with &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; return to BBC1 following its brief departure to the network&#x27;s sister channel BBC Two to allow for coverage of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. To promote the character&#x27;s return, the BBC began airing a trailer across its network&#x27;s channels during July and August 2012. The trailer showed Albert Square and its residents being blown away by &quot;Hurricane Sharon&quot;, who floated down from the sky wearing a wedding dress to the soundtrack of &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; by The Rolling Stones.

Dean described Sharon as a lost soul upon her return: &quot;she&#x27;s totally lost. She doesn&#x27;t know who she is, where she&#x27;s going. There&#x27;s something that comes out later, that&#x27;s happened to her in the States and stuff like that. But she&#x27;s a lost soul, and this is home again. There&#x27;s no place like home, so she finds herself back there again.&quot;

Sharon&#x27;s return in 2012 saw her battling with an addiction to painkillers. Sharon secretly visits an addiction support group but continues to use the painkillers whenever things became difficult in her personal circumstances. The problem culminates in 2013 when Sharon is asked to look after Phil&#x27;s baby granddaughter Lexi Pearce, and is found unconscious by Lexi&#x27;s mother Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) after taking painkillers. Discussing the storyline, Dean said, &quot;Filming the scene where she collapses and Lola finds her was really difficult because it&#x27;s so sad. Sharon thinks she is coping but she evidently isn&#x27;t. She is on such a downward spiral. She can stop using the pills for periods of time, but then something happens and it all gets too much for her. That is the trouble when people rely on things like prescription medication — they&#x27;ll go to any lengths to get what they want.&quot; Dean indicated that she was &quot;fascinated&quot; by this plot development given Sharon&#x27;s history with her mother Angie&#x27;s addiction to alcohol during the 1980s. Dean suggested that Sharon was always &quot;disgusted&quot; by her mother&#x27;s addiction to the extent that she would not even smoke cigarettes, &quot;so the fact that she&#x27;s got this far in life and has now succumbed to an addiction is fascinating.&quot;

=== Reunion with Phil Mitchell ===

Although paired romantically with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) in 2012, Sharon&#x27;s romantic history with Phil was continuously revisited: firstly when Phil and Jack competed for Sharon&#x27;s hand in marriage, and secondly when Sharon kissed Phil despite having chosen to marry Jack. However, it was not until late 2013 when scriptwriters reunited Phil and Sharon legitimately, Sharon having weathered being jilted by Jack at their wedding earlier that year.

Letitia Dean suggested in 2012 that &quot;Sharon has always had a great fondness for Phil and he has always been there for her. She is very comfortable around him and they have a lot of history between them.&quot; Although Dean has speculated that Sharon and Phil are not right for each other, she acknowledged the connection between the characters, suggesting they &quot;know each other inside and out&quot;. She added, &quot;It was real lust between them back in the day. I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s ever lost that feeling for him and vice versa [...] She likes to think there are no surprises with him but he&#x27;s also got that edge to him that she&#x27;s always liked as well. There&#x27;s a familiarity there and he will help her to feel more settled in life [...] There&#x27;s always been a deep affection. I think she did love him greatly but when they first got together, when she was married to his brother Grant, that love was never allowed to blossom really. There have always been underlying feelings for him. This is the first time they can really be together properly and honestly and she wants him warts and all [...] She feels safe with Phil, she feels protected and she always has with him, even when they were just friends she always knew he&#x27;d be there for her.&quot;

As part of Executive Producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins&#x27;s attempt to modernise &quot;EastEnders&quot; and to reflect trendy areas in East London like Shoreditch, Sharon and Phil were given a new wine bar in the soap to front in 2014. Treadwell-Collins said to the &quot;Radio Times&quot;: &quot;It should feel more like London. It&#x27;s been frozen in aspic for too long. Sharon said recently that she&#x27;s looking to be a landlady. As a result, you&#x27;ll see the edges of Shoreditch creeping into &quot;EastEnders&quot;. It&#x27;s got to reflect the modern world.&quot; Treadwell-Collins stated that his aim was not to be too pretentious or &quot;try-hard cool&quot; with Sharon&#x27;s new bar, but for the bar to be somewhere where viewers would want to visit and something for them to laugh at.

The reunion storyline leads to increased animosity between Sharon and &quot;her nemesis&quot; Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), Phil&#x27;s ex-girlfriend who still harboured feelings for him. According to Dean, &quot;Sharon is very astute and she knows that deep down for Phil, Shirley meant something to him. I doubt she knows too much about it, I don&#x27;t think she wants to know too much about it, but I definitely think she&#x27;s wary about it [...] She thinks that Shirley is just quite bitter and jealous of her relationship with Phil and that Shirley needs to move on. Sharon has always been the love of Phil&#x27;s life so Shirley needs to get over it. That&#x27;s the undertone.&quot; Sharon and Shirley&#x27;s rivalry was satirized in a BBC trailer which aired to coincide with the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the trailer, Sharon and Shirley compete with each other by showing off their football skills.

=== Affair with Keanu Taylor (&quot;Sheanu&quot;) ===
In July 2018, it was revealed that Sharon would become involved in an affair with Phil&#x27;s young employee Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). The affair began in August after Phil&#x27;s neglect of Sharon and he went to Spain on business for a number of months. The affair continued until November when Phil returned home and Sharon later went to Australia to get Keanu out of her system. The story was later developed when Keanu slept with and developed a relationship with Sharon&#x27;s stepdaughter Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) whilst she was away, and later returned to find them kissing. Despite the affair ending, it was later expanded when both Louise got pregnant by him and later Sharon too when they slept together again when Keanu believed Louise had aborted his baby. During the course of 2019, it became a prominent storyline, with nods to &quot;Sharongate&quot;. The couple became referred to as &quot;Sheanu&quot; by fans and critics.

In September 2019, it was reported that Sharon would be involved in a major car stunt with Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite). These scenes aired in November, when Sharon indirectly caused Mel to crash after a feud with her after she blackmails her when she finds out about the affair. In October 2019, it was revealed that the paternity test and affair will come out to Phil around Christmas Day, almost a year and half after the storyline started.

==Storylines==
===1985–1995===
Adopted at the age of three by Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), Sharon is raised at The Queen Victoria public house in Albert Square, Walford, where her adoptive parents are landlords. Sharon and her best friend, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully), compete for the affections of Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford). This leads to Sharon wanting to go on the pill, which shocks Angie. However, after Angie gets advice from Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard) and Dr. Harold Legg (Leonard Fenton), Sharon and Angie talk about it and Sharon decides to wait. Her teenage romance with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) ends when Sharon realises she prefers a more experienced man. She then begins a relationship with Simon Wicks (Nick Berry), who ends the relationship when she refuses to have sex (although she eventually loses her virginity to him when she is 18). She seeks refuge from her turbulent home life with church curate, Duncan Boyd (David Gillespie). They plan to marry but Duncan bores Sharon and she ends the engagement. Sharon is torn between her conflicting parents until their marriage deteriorates and, Angie leaves Walford in the spring in 1988. When Den gets involved in gangland crime, he is shot in February 1989 and is believed to be dead, although a search of the canal where he was last seen fails to uncover anything. Shortly afterwards, Michelle confesses to Sharon that Vicki Fowler (Samantha Leigh Martin) is her sister and Sharon is angry and hurt at Michelle.

In the spring of 1990, Sharon discovers Den&#x27;s signet ring on a market stall. With Den&#x27;s body missing, Sharon convinces the police to search the canal again. She is devastated when a body is found and believed to be Den&#x27;s. Sharon resumes her relationship with Simon, but the relationship ends when Simon&#x27;s affair with Cindy Beale (Michelle Collins) is revealed. Hurt and missing her parents, Sharon tracks down her birth mother, Carol Hanley (Sheila White). They meet several times until Carol confesses she has no maternal feelings for Sharon.

Sharon remains at The Queen Vic, working as a barmaid. She starts dating Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). A controlling boyfriend, Grant assaults Sharon&#x27;s boss, Eddie Royle (Michael Melia), when he tries to kiss her. Although Sharon is perturbed by this, she discovers that Grant&#x27;s violent behaviour results from traumatic experiences as a paratrooper in the Falklands War, and agrees to marry him. Eddie does not approve of their relationship and fires Sharon so she takes him to an industrial tribunal for unfair dismissal. She wins but Eddie refuses to reinstate her. Sharon tells Grant she will only marry him if he gets her tenancy back at The Queen Vic. Grant makes this happen and Sharon becomes the new licensee after Eddie is murdered by Nick Cotton (John Altman). Sharon marries Grant on Christmas Day 1991, but their marriage is plagued with arguments and he ends up hitting her on several occasions.

While Grant wants to start a family, Sharon prefers to concentrate on making The Queen Vic a successful business. When Grant discovers she is taking the contraceptive pill, he smashes up the pub and disappears, leaving Sharon to be comforted by his brother, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Sharon has sex with Phil but chooses to stay with Grant. However, the Mitchells&#x27; marriage deteriorates further when Grant torches The Queen Vic in an insurance scam, almost killing Sharon and her dog Roly who are trapped inside. An acrimonious split ensues with Grant hitting Sharon during a power struggle over management of the pub. Michelle calls the police during one of Grant&#x27;s outbursts and he is imprisoned for assaulting them. While he is in prison, Sharon and Phil reunite and secretly live together as a couple. When Grant is released, Sharon takes him back.

Phil gets engaged to Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Realising she still has feelings for Phil, Sharon tries to seduce him. Phil kisses her in a moment of passion that he immediately regrets, so Sharon convinces herself she is happy with Grant and considers having children with him. Simultaneously, Michelle&#x27;s boyfriend Geoff Barnes (David Roper) wants to interview Sharon for a book he is writing. Michelle conducts a recorded interview but then forgets to turn off the recorder at the end and discusses Sharon&#x27;s affair with Phil. Grant finds the tape and, on the night of Phil and Kathy&#x27;s engagement party, he plays it to a packed pub. He then attacks Phil and bullies and humiliates Sharon into agreeing to a divorce. She goes to stay with Angie in America but returns to hostility from the Mitchells. She is unperturbed and wins back the respect of Grant who realises that he still loves her. Wanting revenge for her mistreatment, she leads Grant on whilst planning to humiliate him publicly. They have sex and Sharon lets Grant think a public marriage proposal will seal their reunion. Grant attempts this on The Queen Vic&#x27;s quiz night; Sharon is all set to turn him down but suddenly cannot go through with it and stops him from proposing. She confesses that she loves him, then returns to America alone. She does not return to Walford for six years.

=== 2001–2006 ===
Phil and Grant&#x27;s mother Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor) sells The Queen Vic in May 2001, and is furious to discover that Sharon is the new owner. Sharon&#x27;s boyfriend, Ross Fletcher (Ché Walker), joins her claiming that he has left his wife but Sharon discovers he is lying and ends the relationship and rekindles her romance with Phil. Sharon&#x27;s bombshell that she is infertile following an abortion upsets Phil, and knowing that Phil wouldn&#x27;t be happy without children of his own, they consider adoption before Peggy expresses her horror that Phil could take on &quot;another man&#x27;s mistake&quot;. Sharon ends the relationship in December 2001 and returns to the States to be with her mother. Angie dies from cirrhosis soon afterwards, and Sharon returns to Walford to bury her mother. This affects her badly and soon she starts dating an old school friend, Tom Banks (Colm Ó Maonlaí). The relationship survives Tom&#x27;s unstable wife, Sadie (Isobel Middleton) who is sectioned after holding Sharon hostage and threatening suicide unless Tom takes her back. Sharon later sells her share of The Queen Vic back to the Mitchells and purchases a nightclub with Tom, naming it &quot;Angie&#x27;s Den&quot;. When Tom is diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, Sharon stands by him and they plan to travel after getting married. On the night of their engagement party, however, Tom discovers a fire at the house of fellow neighbours Little Mo Morgan (Kacey Ainsworth) and her abusive husband Trevor (Alex Ferns); after helping Little Mo escape the fire with Trevor&#x27;s son, Tom attempts to rescue Trevor – but the pair are killed when the fire explodes. A devastated Sharon reels over Tom&#x27;s death and later organizes his funeral.

In early 2003, Den&#x27;s daughter Vicki (now played by Scarlett Alice Johnson) returns to Walford. She and Sharon soon discover that they have a brother – Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) – who was the product of one of Den&#x27;s affairs 30 years earlier. Dennis has links to the same criminal organisation as Den and he discovers that Den is alive and living in Spain, and he tells Sharon of this revelation but she refuses to believe him. Dennis and Sharon fall in love, but their romance is halted by Den&#x27;s return. He had survived the shooting in 1989, fleeing to Spain and starting a new life there. The body found in the canal was actually that of a gangland boss who had been murdered as punishment for failing to kill Den.

After years of feeling guilty about disowning Den before his &quot;death&quot;, Sharon is thrilled to see him but furious about the unnecessary hurt he caused – although he informs her that he had to disappear and fake his own death in order to protect his family as well as himself. Den, however, is disgusted to discover Sharon and Dennis&#x27;s romantic relationship and blackmails Dennis into ending it. Dennis begrudgingly dates Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan), but just before Christmas 2004, he secretly reunites with Sharon. Zoe&#x27;s cousin Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) spots them getting out of a cab, holding hands and kissing. Stacey tells Zoe but Zoe does not believe her because she thinks Stacey is jealous and an argument ensues. Sharon and Dennis announce their plan to move to America on Christmas Day, only for Zoe to jeopardise this by announcing to the family that she is pregnant – she was in fact faking a pregnancy on the advice of Den, who was determined to split up Sharon and Dennis. Sharon refuses to let Dennis abandon his child and chooses to leave Walford.

She returns briefly in February 2005 when summoned by Den&#x27;s new wife, Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman), with the news that Den is ill. Chrissie, Zoe, and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) confront Den about various deceitful deeds, including Zoe&#x27;s fake pregnancy and his affairs – which Sharon overhears, just as Chrissie had planned. Disgusted, Sharon leaves, disowning Den as he had split her from Dennis and used her infertility against her.

In a fit of rage, Den attacks Chrissie but is defended by Zoe who hits him over the head with an iron doorstop. Thinking Den to be dead, Chrissie mocks him but as soon as Den returns to consciousness, he grabs her by the leg but Chrissie grabs a bar stool and hits him again over the head, killing him. Aided by Zoe and Sam, Chrissie buries Den in The Queen Vic&#x27;s cellar to cover up the murder.

Dennis soon reunites with Sharon in America and they return to Walford in June 2005 in search of Den, but Chrissie claims he has left with another woman. Zoe leaves for Ibiza, and Sharon and Dennis marry, but during their reception, Sam is arrested for digging up Den&#x27;s body to incriminate Chrissie; however, Sam is charged with Den&#x27;s murder after Stacey gives the police a false alibi for Zoe and Chrissie. Phil and Grant both return to Walford weeks later to convince Sharon of Chrissie&#x27;s guilt, and Sharon and Grant resolve their past grievances, as do Dennis and Phil, and the four work together with Peggy to bring Chrissie to justice. Sharon and the Mitchells try to persuade Stacey to drop her alibi, so Sam can be released, but to no avail following an angry confrontation with Zoe&#x27;s mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), who is trying to protect her daughter from prosecution. Eventually, Phil and Grant manage to extract a tape of Chrissie confessing to Den&#x27;s murder – thus proving her guilt to the police. Chrissie is then arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment after admitting that she had killed Den.

On Christmas Day 2005, Sharon is stunned to discover she is pregnant, and she and Dennis celebrate the potential of having a child. However, their happiness is threatened when Dennis&#x27;s resolved issues with Phil leads him to become embroiled in a conflict against his enemy and the square&#x27;s crime kingpin: Johnny Allen (Billy Murray). When Sharon starts to intervene in Johnny&#x27;s personal affairs in an attempt to warn him to stay away from Dennis, he throttles her warns her that he will kill Dennis unless they leave Walford by midnight on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Sharon persuades Dennis to leave after confiding in Phil about Johnny&#x27;s threat. Phil, seeking upmanship over Johnny, informs Dennis about the threat, telling him that Johnny also killed his friend Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs) almost a year earlier, and informs him that Johnny had just threatened Sharon. Dennis ends up attacking Johnny. Just as the Square&#x27;s residents are welcoming in the new year, he ends up getting stabbed by a mysterious passer-by. He stumbles upon Sharon and dies, leaving Sharon heartbroken and devastated. She refuses to speak in grief but requests that Phil avenges Dennis&#x27;s murder.

Concerned for her unborn child, Phil persuades Sharon to return to Florida to live with Michelle; Sharon later gives birth off-screen to a son, Dennis Rickman Jnr (Harry Hickles/Bleu Landau), and informs Pauline.

During her absence, Phil keeps his promise for Sharon and persuades Grant to help them get justice for Sharon. They confront Johnny and learn that he ordered his henchman, Danny Moon (Jake Maskall) to kill Dennis; the two are nearly killed after Johnny captures the brothers and orders Danny to execute them, but Phil and Grant are saved when Danny is accidentally shot dead by his own brother, Jake Moon (Joel Beckett). Johnny&#x27;s own daughter then turns him in to the police and he confessed to murdering Andy and ordering the murder of Dennis, but he dies a few months later after suffering a heart attack in prison.

On New Year&#x27;s Day 2007, Sharon is unable to attend Pauline Fowler&#x27;s (Wendy Richards) funeral although she sends flowers. On Christmas Day 2008, she calls Ian to wish him a happy Christmas and asks a reluctant Ian to send Phil a big kiss from her. Ian reveals that Dennis is also doing well. In October 2009, Ian spends a few weeks in America for Sharon&#x27;s 40th birthday and reveals that she is doing very well for herself, is still wealthy and lives on a ranch.

=== 2012–present ===
In the summer of 2012, after more than six years away, Sharon returns to Walford asking Phil to help her retrieve Dennis Jnr (Harry Hickles) from her fiancé, John Hewland (Jesse Birdsall), whom she has just jilted at their wedding ceremony. John suggests that he saved Sharon from destitution and kidnaps Dennis but Phil rescues him. Sharon manages Phil&#x27;s nightclub &quot;R&amp;R&quot; and starts dating Jack Branning (Scott Maslen). Sharon and Jack&#x27;s romance is complicated by Phil, who wants to reignite a relationship with Sharon. Both propose to Sharon, but she accepts Jack&#x27;s proposal. Realising he still loves his former wife Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack), Jack cancels the wedding. Phil then persuades Sharon to move in with him but she struggles with Jack&#x27;s rejection and resumes dependency on painkillers. When Sharon passes out while looking after Phil&#x27;s granddaughter Lexi Pearce, he throws her out. The upheaval affects Dennis; he starts misbehaving and clashes at school with teaching assistant Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). Dennis lies when he falls and grazes his arm, telling Sharon that Whitney has assaulted him. Blind to Dennis&#x27;s misbehaviour, Sharon reports Whitney to the school board requesting her dismissal but is forced to contemplate the truth when Whitney is exonerated.

Later, Sharon reunites with Phil and moves back in with him. Her trust in Phil is tested when he confesses his part in the events which led to the death of Dennis, but she nevertheless remains with him and together they buy a new bar: The Albert. Phil grows resentful of Sharon&#x27;s preoccupation with The Albert. To re-assert his authority and demonstrate Sharon&#x27;s vulnerability, Phil hires two men to vandalise the bar, but his plan goes awry when Sharon is attacked by the vandals; she is hospitalised with a ruptured spleen. Phil confides in his ex-lover Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), who helps conceal his botched plan. When Shirley confesses she still loves Phil, he spurns her advances and instead proposes marriage to Sharon after she regains consciousness, which she accepts. Upon release from the hospital, Sharon fears being attacked again. She steals Ronnie&#x27;s gun for protection but is horrified when Dennis almost finds it. While attempting to dispose of the gun, she overhears Shirley reprimanding Phil for arranging the attack on her. She vows revenge and recruits Phil&#x27;s former lawyer, Marcus Christie (Stephen Churchett), to help fleece Phil. She later recants when she sees Phil&#x27;s caring side but, unbeknownst to her, Phil has already discovered her deception. Phil begins an affair with Shirley and vows to humiliate Sharon by dumping her at their wedding so he can be with Shirley. On the wedding day, however, Phil cannot go through with this and after he and Sharon confront each other about their respective deceptions, they agree to marry. Enraged at Phil&#x27;s rejection and unable to stop the marriage from going ahead, Shirley reveals her affair with Phil. Sharon decides to leave but Phil persuades her that he loves her. Shirley threatens to shoot him with Sharon&#x27;s gun, but Phil dismisses her threats. In a tussle between the women, Shirley fires the gun and Phil is shot. When he recovers, they decide to give their marriage another try.

When Sharon receives a letter from her birth mother, Carol, she is ambivalent about resuming contact. She eventually decides to reconnect but discovers her mother has recently died. She meets her half brother Kristopher (Jonathan Broadbent) who gives her old letters from her birth father, Gavin, revealing his interest in meeting Sharon. Sharon attempts to trace Gavin and visits Den&#x27;s former solicitor, Margaret Midhurst (Jan Harvey), who reveals that Den specifically requested to adopt Sharon as he knew her father. Phil is blackmailed into signing The Albert over to Vincent Hubbard (Richard Blackwood), forging Sharon&#x27;s signature. Sharon is angry but Phil pacifies her by revealing he has traced her biological father, now going by the name of Gordon Cook (Stephen Marcus). Phil persuades Sharon not to pursue meeting Gordon, but she changes her mind and visits him. When Gordon is unwelcoming and cannot answer Sharon&#x27;s questions, it emerges that Phil has paid Gordon to pretend to be Sharon&#x27;s father. She eventually manipulates Phil into admitting the truth. Sharon forces Vincent to return his half of the business, but they agree to become business partners. To pacify Sharon, Phil gives her another address for her father. She sees from his house that he must be wealthy, and realises that the two already lead separate lives; she gives up the search. Sharon believes that Max Branning (Jake Wood) is responsible for the murder of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) (see Who Killed Lucy Beale?) but she soon discovers the truth when Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) sends her surrogate brother Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) a video message on his laptop revealing that he killed her. Ian&#x27;s wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) denies this but when Sharon remains unconvinced, Jane admits the truth.

When Phil continuously messages a person called &quot;K&quot;, Sharon suspects that Phil is having an affair with &quot;K&quot; who, unbeknownst to her and Ian, is Kathy – his former wife who had supposedly died in a car crash in South Africa several years earlier. Sharon is reunited with Kathy; she reveals to Sharon that Phil has known that she has been alive for several years, so Sharon leaves Phil and moves into Ian&#x27;s house. Phil goes missing and it is later revealed that Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas), Kathy&#x27;s controlling husband, has taken him hostage, although Phil later returns. Gavin had supposedly died in the same car crash as Kathy.

Sharon arrives home to find Gavin threatening to kill both Kathy and her stepson Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid); he greets her with the words &quot;Hello, Princess&quot; – Den&#x27;s catchphrase, revealing that he is her biological father. She is disgusted when she discovers that Gavin gave Sharon to Den as a business trade. Sharon discovers that Phil has started drinking again and has become violent. When Bobby starts bullying Dennis (now Bleu Landau), Sharon tells Jane and Ian that she will go to the police about Bobby killing Lucy. Bobby and Dennis&#x27;s feud leads to Dennis going missing; when Ian and Phil find him, a drunk and distracted Phil crashes the car, leaving Dennis severely injured. Ian takes the blame for the crash in exchange for Phil convincing Sharon not to go to the police. Gavin visits and supports Sharon in the hospital, and offers her a chance to live with him in Hong Kong when Dennis recovers, but Sharon declines. Sharon is stunned when Phil admits he was driving, so she leaves him. She does not believe Phil when he says he is dying from cirrhosis, and she moves into Ian&#x27;s house until Dennis is discharged. Gavin visits her again, saying he wants a second chance at having a family. Sharon then learns from Phil&#x27;s daughter Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), that Phil has collapsed and is in hospital. At the hospital, Sharon realises Phil was telling the truth, but he has discharged himself to get drunk. When Dennis is discharged from the hospital, Sharon and Dennis leave to stay with Gavin.

Sharon returns with Dennis for Billy (Perry Fenwick) and Honey Mitchell&#x27;s (Emma Barton) second engagement party only to find Phil collapsed on the floor from coughing up blood. His family discover at the hospital that unless Phil stops drinking and undergoes an urgent liver transplant, his condition will be terminal. Sharon refuses to reconcile with Phil and he files for divorce to which Sharon agrees. Sharon and Phil receive letters saying their divorce is close to being finalised, but they decide to rekindle their marriage. Sharon is unaware that Dennis has remained in contact with Gavin, but eventually finds out, and Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) tells her that Kathy has gone with Gavin, so they trace her to Gavin&#x27;s house. As they arrive, Sharon&#x27;s aunt and Gavin&#x27;s sister, Margaret, falls to death on Buster&#x27;s car after being pushed from a balcony by Gavin. Buster and Sharon break into the house to help Kathy, and Sharon urges Gavin to surrender himself to the police, promising to continue their relationship. Gavin decides to comply, but when she lets him out of the room, he tries to escape but is trapped on the balcony. The police arrive on the balcony and he threatens to jump with Sharon but lets her go and is arrested. Sharon returns when she hears that Ben is missing, and she contacts Grant to help find him. She is shocked when Grant&#x27;s daughter Courtney Mitchell (Alice Nokes) tells her that he is not returning, but she finds him and he tells her that he loves her, but Sharon turns him down. Phil then discovers a letter that Michelle Fowler (now Jenna Russell), sent to Peggy, learning that Grant fathered her son, Mark Fowler Jnr (Ned Porteous), after a one-night stand 21 years previously. To stop Phil from telling Grant that Mark is his son, Sharon tells Phil about Grant&#x27;s declaration of love. However, Grant finds out the truth, and Sharon confirms it to Mark when he comes to the realisation.

When Phil recovers from his alcoholism, he makes the decision to not have a liver transplant and prepares to die. Sharon stands by his decision but he changes his mind after realising the effect on Dennis and Louise. Phil is placed on a transplant list but gives up hope, telling Sharon the family need to enjoy Christmas without him; she angrily tells him he can die. However, he returns shortly after, and a new liver is found for Phil and his surgery is successful. Sharon is then reunited with Michelle, and at Michelle&#x27;s leaving party, Sharon overhears Denise Fox (Diane Parish) revealing to Shirley that Phil is the father of her unborn child. Sharon makes plans for her and Dennis to move back to Florida with Michelle until she realises that she and Phil were not together at the time he had sex with Denise. Sharon finds out about Denise&#x27;s plan to have her son adopted so tells Phil the truth after Phil expresses his wish to adopt Dennis. Phil demands to see his son, and Sharon agrees to help Phil fight for custody but then stands by him when he agrees to the adoption. Sharon is mortified when Michelle tells her that she broke the law in America by having a relationship with a 17-year-old student Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor), while she was a teacher. When Michelle is involved in a car crash after her affair with Preston is exposed, Sharon supports her and she talks Preston into leaving Walford, which infuriates Michelle when she regains consciousness.

Sharon supports her stepdaughter Louise when she believes she was raped by Keegan Baker (Zack Morris) after her drink was spiked at a party. The investigation is dropped when Keegan admits that he lied about having sex with Louise. Phil joins Aidan Maguire (Patrick Bergin) in a robbery but the money they steal from his ex-wife Ciara (Denise McCormack) goes missing. Ciara sends her sister-in-law, Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite), back to Walford after sixteen years, to find the stolen money, and Sharon admits to Mel that she took it. Mel tells Ciara and Sharon is forced to return the money. When Phil discovers that Sharon was the culprit, he is initially furious but comes around when she explains that she was stealing the money for him. Their marriage starts to deteriorate and Sharon grows bored and begins lusting over Phil&#x27;s employee, Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters). After Phil announces he is going to Spain without Sharon, she grows even more tired of his neglect and has sex with Keanu. They arrange to meet again at the canal, but Keanu sees her friend Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) disposing of the gun used to shoot Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ). Sharon pays Keanu to remain silent, however, he posts the money back to Sharon and confesses to the police, leading to Linda&#x27;s arrest. Despite this, Sharon and Keanu begin an affair and she is stunned to discover that he is 19 and younger than she believed him to be. The age proves too daunting for Sharon and she ends their affair, however, they later reconcile. Sharon starts receiving threats via text from an unknown person regarding their affair. She believes it to be Keanu&#x27;s mother Karen (Lorraine Stanley) who had spotted them together, but it is Louise. Sharon is able to convince Louise that Keanu has been providing her with fitness lessons and Sharon, scared of sneaking behind Phil&#x27;s back, ends the affair. They agree to remain friends but they continue to have sex until Sharon goes to Australia to stay with Michelle. She returns and realises that Keanu is now in a relationship with Louise, and turns down Keanu&#x27;s advances. After Keanu ends his relationship with Louise and pursues Sharon again, she convinces Phil to send him on an errand in Spain, where he is brutally attacked. Karen blames Sharon, threatening to tell Phil about the affair unless he saves Keanu. Phil travels to Spain to help him, and he later returns to Walford, telling Sharon he blames her for what happened and struggles to forgive her.

Sharon later discovers that Dennis has been storing drugs and counterfeit money for drug dealers, which results in her attacking and threatening one of the dealers, Stix Redman (Kasey McKellar). After Louise is kidnapped and found by Keanu, Sharon is jealous when they resume their relationship. Louise later discovers she is pregnant with Keanu&#x27;s baby and after they briefly reignite their affair, Sharon ends it so Keanu can be there for his child. However, Sharon also discovers she is pregnant but does not know if Phil or Keanu is the father. She settles on having an abortion, but Phil discovers she&#x27;s pregnant, and Sharon lies letting Phil believe he is the father. When Keanu discovers that she is pregnant and that he could be the father, he decides that he should tell Louise about their affair. Sharon and Karen kidnap him in order to prevent this, in an attempt to scare him by showing him what Phil would do if he found out. After Sharon convinces him that Phil is the father, he returns home, promising not to reveal their affair. Mel&#x27;s son Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) is shot dead by S019 officers, after holding Louise at gunpoint, and Phil tells Sharon to refuse Mel from using the E20 accounts to fund his funeral. Mel discovers that Keanu is the father of Sharon&#x27;s baby and she blackmails Sharon for money and a villa in Portugal, as well as forcing her to sell her half of the E20 club to Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton). Sharon finds out that Mel is planning on exposing her affair to Phil and follows her, so Mel hastily attempts to reveal it on a phone via Billy. Before she can tell Billy, Mel crashes into another car and falls unconscious. Whilst Sharon rescues Mel from the wreckage before it explodes, Mel continues to hear Hunter&#x27;s voice and walks into the road and is fatally hit by a lorry. Lisa, whom Mel confided to, tells Phil that Sharon&#x27;s baby is not his, and Phil&#x27;s suspicions are aroused further at Mel&#x27;s funeral when Lisa announces to the pub that Sharon is carrying another man&#x27;s child and that she was only paying for Mel&#x27;s funeral out of guilt, though Sharon denies this. Phil secretly discovers that Keanu is the father and confronts Sharon on Christmas Day, ending their marriage. Sharon is disowned by the Mitchell family, including Dennis. She is taken in by Ian. When Keanu goes missing, Sharon fears that Phil has had him murdered, but Linda tells her that she and Martin Fowler (James Bye) faked his death in order to trick Ben and that there is evidence on Martin&#x27;s burner phone. Sharon later breaks into Martin&#x27;s shed and steals the phone, giving it to the police and leading to Phil and Ben&#x27;s arrests. Soon after, Dennis drowns in a boat crash, and on the same day, Sharon gives birth to a son, Albie Watts, who Karen names &#x27;Kayden&#x27; at first. She finds out from Karen that Phil had caused the boat crash whilst fighting Keanu. Sharon contemplates suicide but is stopped by Ian who supports her. Sharon is furious when Phil returns to Dennis&#x27;s funeral but eventually, bonds with him and they share a kiss. They reunite and Phil promises to buy Sharon The Queen Vic, but Sharon struggles and leaves to stay with Michelle in Australia, without Albie.

Sharon returns and decides to reunite with Phil once more and they move in together. Sharon decides to take Albie from Karen, but Phil is furious and cannot bond with Albie. He forces Sharon to choose between him and Albie, but Sharon chooses Albie and they separate. Ian purchases The Queen Vic for Sharon and she later renames Kayden to Albie. Ian redevelops feelings for Sharon and he is embarrassed when his feelings are not reciprocated by Sharon and he proceeds to harass her. Ian is unaware that Sharon and Phil are working together to murder him for locking Dennis inside the boat, which hindered his escape from the accident. Ian is attacked by Phil, and Sharon lets Ian believe that she loves him and marries him when thinks he is dying. When Phil decides to back out from their plot, Sharon is set on avenging Dennis by poisoning Ian to make him ill, starting with poisoning his Christmas Pudding. Phil comes around and provides Sharon with many poisons to spike his drinks with, before providing Sharon with a lethal dose of cocaine to put into Ian&#x27;s pasta carbonara and ultimately kill him. Sharon cannot go through with it, but Ian finds out the truth and confronts Sharon. She attacks Ian by branding him weak and cowardly, causing Ian to eat the poisoned pasta. Sharon has a change of heart and makes Ian throw up the pasta, thereby saving his life, and annuls her marriage to Ian who leaves Walford. Sharon becomes sole proprietor of the Vic after Ian&#x27;s departure and he transfers ownership to her, but a week later she sells the pub back to the Carters after Linda finds out about her involvement in Ian&#x27;s attack and blackmails her. Sharon is told by Kathy that Gavin has died, and she finds out that she has a half-brother Zack Hudson (James Farrar). She decides to open a gym and has a fling with Kheerat Panesar (Jaz Deol), which ends when Ben, who is Kheerat&#x27;s business partner, objects to their relationship. Sharon grows guilty for her treatment of Ian when she sees Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) get framed for his attack, leading to her disappearance, unaware that she has been murdered by Gray Atkins (Toby-Alexander Smith). Sharon decides to confess the truth to the police, despite Phil&#x27;s attempts to stop her, and he is arrested.

A baby, Alyssa Lennox, is left on Sharon&#x27;s doorstep and she soon discovers that Alyssa was her son Dennis&#x27;s daughter, after a brief relationship with Jada Lennox (Kelsey Calladine-Smith), before his death. Sharon supports Jada and Alyssa, but Phil encourages Sharon to go for full custody when he believes that Jada is irresponsible. They keep this a secret from Jada, but Zack discovers the truth and tells her, and Jada flees with Alyssa. Sharon disowns Zack but they reconcile when he convinces Jada to return with Alyssa. Sharon discovers that Ben is the &quot;Walford Attacker&quot; when she catches him bludgeoning a man with a pole. She agrees to keep quiet and tells Phil, who asks her to assist his now-fiancée, Kat, in managing his businesses. When Phil&#x27;s sister Sam (Kim Medcalf) returns to Walford and buys Ruby&#x27;s nightclub – renaming it &quot;Peggy&#x27;s&quot;, Phil sacks her for her incompetence and instates Sharon as bar manager instead. Sam threatens to inform Kat about Sharon and Phil&#x27;s secret prison meetings unless she is reinstated back as bar manager, but Sharon forces her to drop her threats when she warns her of the consequences of crossing Phil. Sharon later learns from Linda that Sam had purchased the club from the money Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) had stolen from Linda&#x27;s daughter Nancy Carter (Maddy Hill) and her boyfriend Zack, to give to Linda who invested it with Denise into her salon &#x27;Fox &amp; Hair&#x27;, which Denise sold one half of and gave the money to Sam, who was blackmailing her. On the opening of Peggy&#x27;s, Sharon, Kat, Sam, and Shirley are held hostage by henchmen sent from Phil&#x27;s old business associate Jonah Tyler (Mark Mooney) to sabotage the event, resulting in Sam getting shot, though they are unaware that Sam had orchestrated the siege. Shortly after, Kat discovers that Sharon has been secretly visiting Phil in prison and sacks her. Sharon continues to visit Phil and is distraught when Phil is presumed dead after turning down protection from the police by refusing to become an informant. It later transpires that Phil had decided to take the offer and he returns, professing his love to Sharon. Their romance is halted when Phil discovers that Sharon had been secretly messaging Grant and he reunites with Kat. Sharon then develops a feud with Kat when Phil continues to entrust her with his business dealings, making Kat jealous. Sharon is devastated when Phil proposes to Kat and plans to sabotage their wedding; when Kat fails to show up, Sharon comforts Phil and reveals her feelings. They share a kiss which is interrupted by Kat who arrives at the wedding, after being trapped in a boat by her ex-husband Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Phil and Kat do not marry, but Sharon is upset when they move it to another date.

Months later, Sharon is reunited with Keanu when he returns to see their son Albie. Sharon is initially hostile towards Keanu, but they resolve their past grievances and Sharon discovers that she still has feelings for him. They later share a kiss, but Sharon tells Keanu that they cannot have a relationship due to the annoyance of Phil and Karen. They decide to remain friends, but cannot hide their feelings and they resume their relationship. When Sharon discovers that Keanu had previously had a fling with Sam whilst living in Spain, she ends their relationship, and Keanu proceeds to sleep with Chelsea Fox (Zaraah Abrahams). Sharon realises that she has made a mistake and reconciles with Keanu. However, she is hurt when she learns that he has slept with Chelsea and she ends things once again. Linda suggests that Sharon should buy her deceased husband Mick Carter&#x27;s (Danny Dyer) share of The Queen Vic when his death certificate is released, to which Sharon agrees. Sharon sells half of her gym to Phil and Kat in order to raise the money, though secretly Linda has also entered into negotiations with Nish (Navin Chowdhry) and Suki Panesar (Balvinder Sopal). Keanu attempts to win Sharon back by proposing to her during the gym relaunch. Sharon turns him down and decides that they should remain in a relationship. Keanu persuades Sharon to have a christening for Albie, but unbeknownst to Sharon, he has been reluctantly smuggling drugs for Nish&#x27;s son, Ravi Gulati (Aaron Thiara) in order to fund it. Albie&#x27;s christening is conducted by her ex-fiancé Duncan, but the service is interrupted when Keanu is arrested for possession of drugs. Upset by his actions, Sharon breaks up with him. When Keanu is found unconscious and close to death in the middle of the square after being assaulted by Ravi, Sharon stands by him and reports Ravi to the police. She soon becomes engaged to Keanu, and Nish attempts to threaten them into silence but Sharon rebuffs his threats. Sharon is furious when Linda breaks off their partnership and chooses her mother, Elaine Peacock (Harriet Thorpe), as the co-owner of The Queen Vic instead. Sharon and Keanu later split after she helps Lisa to leave the country with Peggy, with Keanu unable to forgive Sharon for her betrayal. Sharon and Linda then reconcile after being locked in The Vic cellar together.

Sharon considers moving to Abu Dhabi after she is offered a job there and plans on taking Albie. In an attempt to keep Albie to himself, Keanu abducts him with the help of Karen and plans on fleeing the country with him, however the plan goes wrong and in a moment of desperation, Keanu lies and claims that Albie was abducted in the park. Sharon is devastated over her son&#x27;s kidnapping and later receives a ransom note, written by Karen, demanding £50,000 in exchange for Albie&#x27;s safe return. Sharon borrows the money from Phil and pays the ransom and Albie is returned to her. Following the ordeal, Keanu and Sharon reconcile their relationship once again and become engaged again. Sharon is shocked when blood tests carried out for Albie reveal that Keanu isn&#x27;t his father after all and that Phil is his biological father, however she decides to keep this to herself, although she later tells Linda whilst Kat also overhears but agrees to keep quiet when Sharon threatens to ruin her and Phil&#x27;s marriage. Sharon is horrified when Phil reveals that Karen was behind Albie&#x27;s kidnapping and she slaps Karen, whilst Keanu lets his mother take the fall for his actions. On her wedding day to Keanu on Christmas Day, Phil interrupts the ceremony and reveals that Keanu was involved in Albie&#x27;s kidnapping, which his sister Bernie Taylor (Clair Norris) confirms. Sharon is disgusted at the revelation and slaps Keanu in the face. Sharon then reveals to him that he isn&#x27;t Albie&#x27;s father and that Phil is, however Phil overhears this and is shocked at what he has heard. Sharon calls off the wedding and goes back to the Vic with Linda and Kathy for a lock-in, where they are later joined by Denise, Stacey and Suki. Nish comes to the Vic after Sharon and the others encourage Suki to invite him and stand up for herself, however the confrontation turns violent when Nish begins attacking Suki and Denise hits him over the head with a bottle of wine in defense. Sharon then declares Nish dead when she is unable to find a pulse, and Keanu arrives at the Vic seeing Sharon standing over Nish&#x27;s body. He then tries to go upstairs to get Albie and threatens to have Sharon sent to prison for killing Nish, to which Sharon rebukes his threats and taunts him about not being Albie&#x27;s father. Keanu turns violent and in a moment of rage, he begins strangling Sharon, leading to Linda stabbing him in the back with a meat thermometer and killing him. A grief stricken Sharon leaves for Australia with Albie to see Michelle.

Upon returning, Sharon decides to help the other women by disposing of the meat thermometer after Linda fails to do so, but it goes missing just as Keanu&#x27;s body is discovered. As the prime suspect for Keanu&#x27;s murder, Sharon is arrested. Linda eventually finds the meat thermometer, and Stacey devises a plan to frame Linda&#x27;s rapist Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), by planting the object in his apartment. Dean is arrested despite proclaiming his innocence, leading to Sharon&#x27;s release. Sharon confides in Phil about Nish&#x27;s attack and Linda&#x27;s role in Keanu&#x27;s death. Phil agrees to keep quiet, and they share a kiss, but Sharon feels it is too soon for another relationship and refuses to reunite with him. Sharon is tricked by Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) into investing so he can steal her and Phil&#x27;s money. She becomes close to Phil&#x27;s cousin Teddy Mitchell (Roland Manookian), who decides to help them retrieve the money from Reiss. Sharon is falsely accused by Bernie of being Keanu&#x27;s killer, and Bernie starts blackmailing Linda, believing she is protecting Sharon, unaware that Linda is the culprit. During Dean&#x27;s trial for Keanu&#x27;s murder, Sharon has an argument with the judge after he dishonors her, and she is sent to prison for seven days after being held in contempt of court. While in prison, Sharon is reunited with her former stepmother, Chrissie Watts. Sharon forgives Chrissie for killing Den and tells Chrissie about her role in Keanu&#x27;s death. After she discovers that Chrissie has set her up for a fight with other inmates, she takes back her forgiveness. During a riot in the wing, Chrissie drags Sharon back to her cell, threatening her with a shiv and boiling water. She reveals that she had miscarried Jake Moon&#x27;s (Joel Beckett) baby after being imprisoned, and blames Sharon for teaming up with the Mitchells, putting her in prison. As Chrissie attempts to stab Sharon, the guards intervene and place Chrissie in segregation. Before being taken away, Chrissie threatens to expose Sharon’s involvement in Keanu’s murder. Sharon decides not to report the incident, and they later make amends before Chrissie is released. Chrissie also reveals that her former cellmate, Ruby Allen (Louisa Lytton), had left prison to give birth to Martin&#x27;s child. After being released, she promises to be there for Linda when she is confronted by Elaine, who now knows about her mother. Sharon effectively evades justice for her part in Keanu&#x27;s death when Nish himself takes credit for the murder, resulting in his arrest; she subsequently convinces Bernie not to report The Six to the police when she returns to Walford after Linda confessed to her in the aftermath of Dean&#x27;s trial.

Sharon becomes concerned for Phil&#x27;s mental health when he sells the nightclub to Teddy&#x27;s ex-wife Nicola Mitchell (Laura Doddington), believing he is becoming more isolated from the others. When Nish escapes prison, Teddy comforts a fearful Sharon; the two then have sex. When Nicola attempts to force Phil to relapse in the hopes of breaking up Teddy and Sharon, Sharon becomes fully aware of Phil&#x27;s loneliness, but Phil refuses any more help. On Christmas Day 2024, Sharon visits Phil after he walks out of the Mitchell family Christmas dinner, where she discusses her concern for Phil&#x27;s emotional state with Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley). Sharon&#x27;s continues to worry about Phil despite his insistence that he is fine. Phil goes missing during Billy and Honey&#x27;s wedding, and Sharon, Grant, Nigel, and Linda search for him. Sharon becomes trapped under rubble when The Queen Vic explodes after Reiss accidentally crashes into gas canisters that start a fire. She hallucinates her mother, Angie, who convinces her to keep living by screaming for help. Grant saves Sharon but she is devastated to learn that Martin died in the accident. After being discharged from hospital and an argument with Teddy over him declining a call from Michelle, Sharon and Grant sleep together.

== Reception ==
Sharon has been dubbed one of the &quot;most popular&quot; characters in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Television critic Matt Bayliss, who once wrote storylines for &quot;EastEnders&quot;, suggested in 2010 that what made Sharon an interesting, classic, female character was that her psychology was laid bare; viewers could see how her troubled upbringing contributed to the mistakes she made and the low self-esteem she had in latter life. In December 2004 the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; reported that executive producer Kathleen Hutchison offered to double Dean&#x27;s salary from £150,000 a year to £300,000 a year, to persuade her to remain in the show, making her one of the highest paid actresses in British soap opera. In a 2007 poll carried out by &quot;Inside Soap&quot;, Sharon, who was then on a hiatus from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, was voted the character that readers most wanted to see return. In a NTL poll in 2003, one third of viewers picked Sharon&#x27;s comeback in 2001 as their favourite, and in a &quot;Radio Times&quot; poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 21% chose Sharon as the soap character they were most pleased to see return.

Letitia Dean has been nominated for multiple awards for her portrayal of Sharon. In 1995, she was nominated in the &quot;Most Popular Actress&quot; category at the National Television Awards. Dean was nominated for the &quot;Best Actress Award&quot; at The British Soap Awards in 2004, and she was also nominated in the category of &quot;Best Dramatic Performance&quot; for &quot;Den&#x27;s Return&quot;. At the 2005 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; awards, Dean was presented with the coveted award for outstanding achievement as homage to her work in &quot;EastEnders&quot;; at the time of the awards ceremony, she had appeared in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (on and off) for over 20 years. She was also nominated in the category of Best Couple (shared with Nigel Harman). Dean was nominated for &quot;Best Actress&quot; for the &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards 2014. In November 2018, Sharon&#x27;s pairing with Keanu was nominated for Best Soap Couple at the 2018 &quot;Digital Spy&quot; Reader Awards; they came in ninth place with 4% of the total votes.

In 2001, a storyline that saw Sharon confessing to her lover Phil that she was infertile was discussed in &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Jenni Murray. Of interest to the journalist was Sharon&#x27;s declaration that she had become infertile because she aborted Grant&#x27;s baby in 1995, and although the abortion was successful, she did not take a post-op course of anti-biotics; it was a subsequent infection that left her infertile. Of concern to Murray was the deleterious effect that broadcasting such a negative outcome of abortion may have on any female viewers considering the procedure. Murray stated: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to see why infertility as a result of abortion is manna from heaven to writers hungry for dramatic storylines. Could there be any greater irony than to abort the foetus of one man [Grant], fall in love with his brother [Phil], long to have his child and then find that the dire consequences of the first action deprive you of the delights of the second [...] But how much poetic licence has to be employed to service these plots in which women are consistently punished for exercising their legal right to choose to abort a foetus they don&#x27;t want to carry? In Sharon&#x27;s case because she was running away from a violent man&quot;. Discussing the matter, Ann Furedi of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service confirmed a relatively high risk of infection from abortion, but opined that any good service provides anti-biotics and screens for chlamydia, so the risks are manageable, and the risks of hysterectomy are so rare as to be &quot;negligible&quot;. Furedi said that women who consider abortion often feel ambivalent, guilty and have an exaggerated sense of the risks to their future fertility and she suggested that TV makers were &quot;cruel, not just wrong [...] to crank up those fears.&quot;. David Painton, a leading authority on abortion, expressed concern that such storylines bolster the views of anti-abortionists who &quot;claim wrongly that the procedure is dangerous&quot;. Painton stated that although it is now virtually unknown for women to have difficulty conceiving again following a termination, if their doctor instructs a course of anti-biotics to stop infection, then it is important to take the medication. Summarising the storyline and its potential impact, Murray said, &quot;In some ways, the &quot;EastEnders&quot; story could be seen as a useful cautionary tale. Sharon was properly informed about the risk, failed to act on her doctor&#x27;s advice and suffers the consequences of her own failure. The scriptwriters can&#x27;t be accused of presenting a false picture, although it&#x27;s hard to imagine how anyone with half a brain, told that a course of antibiotics will protect her future fertility, wouldn&#x27;t take the trouble to swallow a few tablets for a week.&quot;

Discussing Sharon&#x27;s initial exit in 1995, Alison Pearson writing for &quot;The Independent&quot; felt that the script, which saw Sharon misleading Grant into a reunion, was not in-keeping with the character. She commented, &quot;In soap, character is destiny, and I have to say that I didn&#x27;t really believe in Sharon&#x27;s plan for elaborate revenge on Grant. It was a mechanism for getting actress Letitia Dean her freedom and not true to the nature of the character we had grown to know. You could not fault the central performances, though. Albert Square will be a less rounded place without Sharon.&quot; Conversely, reporter Matthew Bayliss was positive about the exit stating, &quot;[Sharon] survived the sort of shunning normally suffered by 13th-century Welsh witches in order to wreak the perfect revenge on Grant, tricking him into publicly proposing to her, just so she could turn him down. Rarely has a character&#x27;s exit been so satisfying to watch, and it was a homage to Sharon&#x27;s strengths as a character that she left with so much unfinished business behind her.&quot;

When it was announced in 2000 that Sharon was returning, Bayliss received the news positively. He suggested that viewers had invested a lot in Sharon, in that they had come to believe in her, having followed her over a large number of years, transgressing from teenager to adult. He described Sharon as an engaging, complex and great soap character, commending the producers of &quot;EastEnders&quot; for bringing her back. He commented, &quot;with a vintage original such as Sharon as [EastEnders&#x27;] latest weapon in the ratings war, it&#x27;s hard to see what can go wrong.&quot;

During a period of falling ratings amid heavy media criticism aimed at &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2004, executive producer Louise Berridge spoke to the press about reasons for viewer complaints. She claimed that one reason viewers felt &quot;EastEnders&quot; had been weaker in 2004, was because some were displeased when storylines that they &quot;love&quot;, such as the Sharon-Dennis romance, were not featured prominently at all times. She commented, &quot;it&#x27;s disappointing to read that a large number of viewers feel the show has been weaker over this past year—although to some extent I fear this was inevitable. In a way, it has been a victim of its own success. The phenomenal popularity of the Kat and Alfie storyline was such that some viewers complained if these characters were not the centre of every storyline. A similar thing is happening with the tremendously successful &#x27;Shannis&#x27; storyline (the affair between Dennis and Sharon)—people love it so much, hundreds are writing in demanding to see more of it.&quot;

Sarah Ellis of &quot;Inside Soap&quot; said that the magazine&#x27;s staff had never been so excited as they were when they heard Sharon was returning in 2012. She said that they were &quot;dying&quot; to know which male character Sharon will take an interest in first. Ross Kemp who played Grant Mitchell and Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell expressed pleasure at the return of Sharon and Letitia Dean in 2012, with McFadden suggesting that Letitia&#x27;s former stint in &quot;EastEnders&quot; was part of a golden era of the soap opera. He described her return as brilliant.

Media reporter for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Stuart Heritage, was critical about &quot;EastEnders&quot;&#x27; decision to reintroduce Sharon for the third time in 2012, suggesting that it meant that the programme had run out of original ideas. Heritage commented, &quot;Even Letitia Dean has probably lost count of the times she&#x27;s left and returned as Sharon. She&#x27;s spent the last 18 years running away to the United States, only to come back to buy a pub or bury her mum, or to have sex with a Mitchell brother, or the other Mitchell brother, or her own adopted sibling, or to confront her inexplicably twice-dead father. Often Sharon&#x27;s haircut will imperceptibly change upon her arrival, but everything else—the quivering lip, the worrying breathlessness, the consistent inability to refer to Phil Mitchell as anything other than &#x27;Fiw&#x27;—remains the same. This is how it&#x27;s likely to be this time around, regardless of if anyone actually wants her back or not [...] There are other offenders—Bianca, Janine, Mandy, Grant—but Sharon is the worst, simply because she&#x27;s so prolific&quot;. Letitia Dean defended her comeback saying, &quot;I think with any sort of ongoing drama like &quot;EastEnders&quot; you need old blood, new blood, it just needs a balance.&quot; Steve McFadden added &quot;What Letitia is doing is bringing back some history and you can&#x27;t buy that. It takes years to build that up.&quot;

In 2020, Sara Wallis and Ian Hyland from The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; placed Sharon first on their ranked list of the best &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters of all time, calling her &quot;Queen Sharon&quot; and noting that she has been involved in some of the soap&#x27;s &quot;most memorable storylines&quot; such as Sharongate and becoming pregnant at the age of 50 from her affair with the younger Keanu.

== In popular culture ==

The character of Sharon has been spoofed in the ITV cartoon sketch show &quot;2DTV&quot; where in one sketch, she was likened to the Jim Henson Muppet Miss Piggy. The character has also been spoofed by the Scottish impressionist Ronni Ancona in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Big Impression&quot;. Ancona&#x27;s impression mocked Sharon&#x27;s pronunciation, implying that she pouts a lot and that she looks badly dubbed, as her lips quiver after delivering a line. The episodes featuring Sharon aired on the Christmas Day special of the programme, in 2001.

The character was also spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show &quot;The Real McCoy&quot;. One of the show&#x27;s recurring sketches featured a spoof version of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, with black and Asian comedians taking over roles of well-known &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. Actress and comedian Meera Syal played the role of Sharon in the sketches.

Impressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of Sharon Watts in the seventh series of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;.

<text>The Mexican Service Medal was an award of the United States military for service in Mexico from 1911 to 1919.

==History==
The Mexican Service Medal awarded by the Army was established by General Orders of the United States War Department on December 12, 1917. The Navy&#x27;s Mexican Service Medal was established by Navy Department General Orders Number 365 on February 11, 1918, as amended by Navy Department General Orders No. 464 of April 27, 1919. The Mexican Service Medal recognizes those servicemen who performed military service against Mexican forces between April 12, 1911 and June 16, 1919.

To be awarded the Mexican Service Medal, a serviceman was required to perform military duty during the time period of eligibility and in one of the following military engagements.

*Veracruz Expedition: April 21 to November 23, 1914
*Punitive Expedition into Mexico: March 14, 1916 to February 7, 1917
*Buena Vista, Mexico: December 1, 1917
*The punitive expedition in the aftermath of the Brite Ranch raid on San Bernardino Canyon, Mexico, December 26, 1917
*La Grulla, Texas: January 8–9, 1918
*The aftermath of the Neville Ranch raid that resulted in a small action in the village of Pilares, Chihuahua: March 28, 1918
*For actions in Nogales, Arizona during the Battle of Nogales, November 1–26, 1915, or Battle of Ambos Nogales, August 27, 1918
*El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua for the Battle of Ciudad Juárez : June 15–16, 1919

The United States Navy issued the Mexican Service Medal to the sailors and Marines who participated in any of the above actions, as well as to servicemen who served aboard U.S. naval vessels patrolling Mexican waters between April 21 and November 26, 1914, or between March 14, 1916, and February 7, 1917. 

The Mexican Service Medal was also awarded to any servicemen who was wounded or killed while participating in action any against hostile Mexican forces between April 12, 1911, and February 7, 1917.

Although the Mexican Service Medal was a single decoration, the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy issued two different versions of it. The Army version displays an engraving of a yucca plant, while the Navy version depicts the San Juan de Ulúa fortress in Veracruz harbor. Both versions display the annotation &quot;1911 – 1917&quot; on the bottom of the medal. 
The Mexican Service Medal was a one-time decoration and there were no service stars authorized for those who had participated in multiple engagements. For those soldiers who had been cited for gallantry in combat, the Citation Star was authorized as a device to the Mexican Service Medal. There were no devices authorized for the Navy&#x27;s version of the decoration.

A similar decoration, known as the Mexican Border Service Medal also existed for those who had performed support duty to Mexican combat expeditions from within the United States.

==Notable recipients==
*General of the Armies John J. Pershing
*General of the Army Douglas MacArthur
*Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy, USN
*Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King, USN

*Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr., USN

*General George S. Patton

<text>Millennial is an online journal and blog written by millennial Catholics offering &quot;world-class Catholic opinion and analysis on the most pressing issues of our times in politics, religion, and culture.&quot; The authors, described as &quot;quite an impressive group of commentators,&quot; are said to &quot;perfectly weave together current events and the Catholic intellectual tradition&quot; and are adept at &quot;finding real-world practicality to Catholic theology.&quot;

Called &quot;an online home to Catholic writers in their 20s and 30s,&quot; the site seeks to &quot;amplify the voices of a younger generation and provide insight and analysis on the issues that matter to this generation.&quot; There is no precise definition of when the millennial generation began, but all millennial writers were born during the pontificate of John Paul II.

The blog &quot;eschews a Catholicism forced to fit neatly into left- or right-leaning ideological camps.&quot; The writers, according to the editor, are &quot;the most talented people who are orthodox and committed to church teaching on the sanctity of human life and social justice.”

It has been said that Millennial &quot;perfectly represents the future of young intellectuals in the church&quot; and Michael Sean Winters of the National Catholic Reporter has encouraged his readers to &quot;regularly consult the writings of these fine young Catholic thinkers.&quot; Articles and posts mix &quot;intellectual rigor with crisp writing and nuanced reflection.&quot; Journal articles and blog entries from Millennial have been cited in places such as &quot;Commonweal&quot;, Religion News Service, &quot;U.S. Catholic&quot;, and elsewhere.

It was founded in 2013 by Robert Christian and Christopher Hale, two millennial Catholics who met at Holy Trinity Church in Washington, DC. It is funded by Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good.

<text>Cypress Provincial Park is a provincial park on the North Shore of Metro Vancouver Regional District, British Columbia. The park has two sections: a southern section which is accessible by road from West Vancouver, and a northern section which is only accessible by hiking trails. The two sections are linked by a narrow strip of park along the mountainous Howe Sound Crest Trail.

The southern section of Cypress Provincial Park contains a ski area (Cypress Mountain Ski Area) that is operated under a Park Use Permit by a private company called Cypress Bowl Recreations Ltd, owned by Boyne Canada, a subsidiary of US-based Boyne Resorts.

== Etymology ==
The name Cypress refers to the tree &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis,&quot; also known as &quot;yellow cedar&quot; or &quot;yellow cypress,&quot; which is common in the park at altitudes over 800 metres. Cypress Bowl is the name of the bowl between the three mountains that make up the Cypress Mountain Ski Area (Mount Strachan, Black Mountain, and Hollyburn Mountain).

== History ==
Evidence of Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations use has been documented in the park, including 350-400 year old bark-stripping scars on old-growth yellow cedar trees above Yew Lake.

Logging first began in 1870 to clear cut dense forests on Mount Vaughan, later renamed to Hollyburn Mountain in 1912. In 1918, James Nasmyth started a logging operation and built a mill on Rodgers Creek which operated until 1923. In the 1920s, Hollyburn Mountain became a popular recreation area for hikers and skiers utilizing the old logging roads. In 1926, the Hollyburn Lodge was built on First Lake, becoming the first commercial ski camp on the North Shore when it opened as the Hollyburn Ski Camp on January 16, 1927. In 1933, the West Lake Ski Camp also opened. By the late 1930s, Heaps Timber Company acquired timber leases in the Hollyburn and Cypress Bowl area. Public controversy forced the provincial government to set aside Cypress Bowl as a park reserve in 1944, after 40 hectares had already been logged. On January 17, 1951, the Hollyburn Aerial Tram (HAT) chairlift and HAT Inn opened near Hi-View Lookout. With rising popularity of skiing, nearly 300 cabins were built on Hollyburn Ridge by the 1960s.

Clear-cut logging resumed in 1966, affecting portions of Black Mountain and Strachan Mountain. The controversy about logging in the park, under the oversight of the Social Credit government, was debated in the BC Legislature and reported on in the media.[&quot;]&quot; Public outrage caused the province to take over development of winter recreation, resulting in the creation of Alpine and Nordic skiing facilities in 1970 and the construction of Cypress Bowl Road in 1973. Cypress Provincial Park was granted Class A Provincial Park status in 1975. The park was expanded north in 1982 to its current boundaries. The expansion included a narrow ridge running from Cypress Bowl to Brunswick Mountain, along what is now the Howe Sound Crest Trail, and a valley of subalpine mountain lakes (Brunswick Lake, Hanover Lake, and Deeks Lake). The Howe Sound Crest Trail linking the two park sections was completed by the late 1980s.

In 1984, the ski resorts, formerly operated by BC Parks, were privatized and now operate under a Park Use Permit. Beginning in 1986, the ski resort operator began attempts to block public access to winter activities in the provincial park without a day pass, resulting in protests. Hiker access trails were later developed to ensure public access to park areas outside of the resort area. The resort has unsuccessfully petitioned to expanded their Park Use Permit area numerous times but in 2002, 40 hectares of second growth forest on Black Mountain were added to the permit area, while a similar area of mostly old-growth forest and subalpine meadow on Hollyburn and Strachan was removed from the permit area. Cypress Creek Lodge opened in 2008. In 2010, Cypress helped host the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver where it hosted Freestyle Skiing and Snowboarding competitions. The original Hollyburn Lodge, first constructed in 1926, completed renovations and reopened in 2018.

== Climate ==
== Winter season ==

During the winter, this is a ski area for both cross-country and alpine skiers. The ski operation has four quad (2 are high speed) and two double chairlifts, as well as a tube tow and a magic carpet for their ski school participants. With 53 downhill runs (beginner 23%, intermediate 37%, advanced 40%) and over of cross-country trails, Cypress Mountain is the largest ski area on Vancouver&#x27;s North Shore. It also has the highest vertical rise, , of the three North Shore ski resorts.

== Summer use ==

In summer and fall, the park is usually free of snow and is popular with hikers. Its trail system includes sections of the Baden-Powell Trail in the southern section of the park, as well as the Howe Sound Crest Trail in the northern section. Parkbus offers a seasonal shuttle service to the park.

Beginning in the summer of 2005, Cypress Mountain Resort has created a lift-assisted mountain bike park, as set out in the 1997 Cypress Provincial Park Master Plan. Even though the lift accessed biking has now been closed for Olympic preparations and they have not yet bothered to restore the trails Cypress still hold many non-lift accessed bike trails. Most of these trails are situated lower down the mountain and are actually not a part of the park because of this they are under threat to development. These Trails on Cypress (Black Mountain Side) are known around the world for being some of the most technically challenging in the world, more challenging than the other two shore mountains (Seymour and Fromme). Trails on Cypress are known as being steep, eroded, and very dangerous. It has multiple rock faces that are close to vertical also having large jumps and drops. Most famous of these is the Brutus Gap, (appearing in many large bike films) it is a step-down drop in excess of in both length and height. That being said Cypress does house some more easily ridable trails, still not easy by any means but more accessible. Some of these include: Mystery DH, Stupid Grouse, Slippery Canoe, Upper Tall Cans, Firehose, and Pull Tab. Some of the legendary and most difficult trails are: 5th Horseman, Sex Girl, Shoreplay. One of the original trails is pre-reaper and reaper these are steep trails that used to have some very difficult man made features, sadly most of these were sawed down and destroyed by the government. For more information regarding trails on Cypress there are mountain bike specific maps that include many of the trails and is a great place to start for riding on the mountain.

== Major mountains in the park ==

The lower section of the park contains three main mountains that form Cypress Bowl. The upper, smaller, section includes a series of mountains along a north–south ridge from St. Mark&#x27;s in the south to Gotha Peak in the far north of the park.

== 2010 Olympics ==
A significant part of Vancouver&#x27;s 2010 Winter Olympics was hosted by Cypress in February 2010, including the snowboard (half-pipe, snowboard cross and parallel giant slalom) and freestyle skiing (moguls and aerials) events, as well as the recently added Skiercross, which used the snowboardcross run, with some modifications. The Freestyle Venue was completed in the Fall of 2006.

<text>Herman Eugene Talmadge (August 9, 1913 – March 21, 2002) was an American politician who served as governor of Georgia in 1947 and from 1948 to 1955 and as a U.S. senator from Georgia from 1957 to 1981. A Democrat, Talmadge served during a time of political transition, both in Georgia and nationally. He began his career as a staunch segregationist known for his opposition to civil rights, including supporting legislation that would have closed public schools to prevent desegregation. By the later stages of his career, following the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, which gave substance to the Fifteenth Amendment enacted nearly one hundred years before, and increased African American voter participation, Talmadge, like many other Southern politicians of that period, had modified his views on race. His life eventually encapsulated the emergence of his native Georgia from entrenched white supremacy into a multiracial political culture where many white voters regularly elect Black and other non-white candidates to the U.S. Congress and Georgia General Assembly.

When his father, Eugene Talmadge, won the 1946 Georgia gubernatorial election but died before taking office, Herman Talmadge asserted claims to be the 70th governor of Georgia, in what became known as the three governors controversy. He occupied the governor&#x27;s office from January until March 1947, before yielding to a Georgia Supreme Court decision in favor of Lieutenant Governor Melvin E. Thompson. In 1948, Talmadge defeated Thompson by more than 6 percent in a special election to complete the elder Talmadge&#x27;s unfinished four-year term. He was reelected in 1950, defeating Thompson by a narrower margin. Talmadge served until the end of his term in 1955.

Talmadge, who first became governor at age 33, supported a new statewide sales tax during his second term to fund the construction of new schools and expanded state services. He also supported other infrastructure improvements and increased teachers&#x27; salaries. In so doing, the younger governor Talmadge departed from his father&#x27;s stingy, low-tax and low-spending philosophy while remaining steadfastly opposed to racial desegregation and political equality for Black Americans. He left the governor&#x27;s office as an incredibly popular executive whose administration earned praise from the traditionally liberal outlets such as the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; and even &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine.&quot;

Herman Talmadge was elected to the United States Senate in 1956 when Walter F. George, Georgia&#x27;s senior senator and the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, declined to seek reelection. In the Senate, Talmadge was a long-serving member of the Senate Agriculture Committee as well as the Senate Finance Committee. During the latter part of his career, he also served as a member of the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (better known as the Senate Watergate Committee). As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he oversaw the passage of numerous pieces of important legislation, including the expansion of the Child Nutrition Act and the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972, the first major legislation dealing with rural development since the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. The Senate later denounced Talmadge for financial irregularities that were revealed during a Senate Ethics Committee investigation following a contentious divorce from his second wife. The investigation, as well as Georgia&#x27;s changing demographics, helped Republican Mack Mattingly defeat Talmadge for re-election in 1980. Following his defeat, Talmadge retired from public life.

==Early life, education and military service==
Herman Talmadge was born on August 9, 1913, on a farm near the small town of McRae in Telfair County in southeastern Georgia. He was the only son of Eugene Talmadge and his wife, Mattie (Thurmond), and through his mother, he was a second cousin of South Carolina Senator and 1948 Dixiecrat presidential candidate Strom Thurmond. Herman attended public schools in Telfair County until his senior year of high school, when his family moved to Atlanta and he enrolled at Druid Hills High School, graduating in 1931. In the fall of 1931, he entered the University of Georgia for his undergraduate degree and was a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society and Sigma Nu fraternity. After completing his undergraduate studies, Talmadge enrolled in the University of Georgia School of Law. He received his law degree in 1936 and joined his father&#x27;s law practice.

In 1937, Talmadge married Katherine Williamson. The marriage ended in divorce after three years. In 1941, he married Betty Shingler, and they had two sons, Herman Eugene Jr. and Robert Shingler. When World War II broke out, Talmadge volunteered to serve in the United States Navy. He served as an ensign with the Sixth Naval District at Charleston, and with the Third Naval District in New York after graduating from midshipman&#x27;s school at Northwestern University. In 1942, Talmadge participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal aboard the . He served as flag secretary to the commandant of naval forces in New Zealand from June 1943 to April 1944 and then as executive officer of the . Talmadge participated in the battle of Okinawa and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Japanese surrender. He attained the rank of lieutenant commander and was discharged in November 1945.

After his service in World War II, Talmadge returned to his home in Lovejoy, Georgia. While continuing to practice law and to farm, he took over publishing his father&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The Statesman&quot;, and started a ham-curing business.

==Three governors controversy==

After returning from the war, Talmadge became active in Democratic Party politics. He ran his father&#x27;s successful 1946 campaign for governor. Eugene Talmadge had been ill, and his supporters were worried about his surviving long enough to be sworn in. They studied the state constitution and found that if the governor-elect died before his term began, the Georgia General Assembly would choose between the second and third-place finishers. The elder Talmadge ran unopposed among Democrats, so the party officials arranged for write-in votes for Herman Talmadge as insurance.

In December 1946, Eugene Talmadge died before taking office. Melvin E. Thompson, the lieutenant governor-elect; Ellis Arnall, the sitting governor; and Herman Talmadge all arranged to be sworn in and concurrently tried to conduct state business from the Georgia State Capitol. Arnall relinquished his claim in favor of Thompson. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Georgia supported Thompson.

==Elected Georgia governor==

Talmadge prepared to run for the special gubernatorial election in 1948, and defeated Thompson. He was elected to a full term in the 1950 election. During his tenure, Talmadge attracted new industries to Georgia. He remained a staunch supporter of racial segregation even as the civil rights movement gained momentum. Talmadge was barred by law from seeking reelection in 1954. That year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, and advised school systems to integrate.

==United States Senate career==
As part of Talmadge&#x27;s 1956 Senate campaign, he published the infamous segregationist pamphlet &quot;You and Segregation&quot;, arguing that desegregation was a communist plot, that the use of federal power to ban segregation was unconstitutional, and that, in the now-infamous phrase, the United States was a &quot;Republic not a Democracy&quot;, since democracy was communist.

Talmadge was elected to the United States Senate in 1956. Most Black people in Georgia were still disenfranchised under state laws passed by white Democrats and discriminatory practices they had conducted since the turn of the 20th century. As a U.S. senator, Talmadge continued to oppose civil rights legislation, even as the civil rights movement gained media coverage and increasing support. After President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Talmadge, along with more than a dozen other southern senators, boycotted the 1964 Democratic National Convention.

With the help of Senator Richard Russell, Talmadge had been appointed to the Agriculture Committee during his first year in Washington and to the Senate Finance Committee shortly thereafter. As a junior member of the Agriculture Committee, he worked to address the nation&#x27;s farmers&#x27; changing needs in an evolving global economy. Talmadge also worked to expand support for both farmers and children and families in hunger through his work on the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, but most significantly in 1969 and 1970 as part of the reauthorization and expansion of the 1946 School Lunch Act, which Russell had authored and considered his greatest legislative achievement.

Talmadge was a great admirer of the work Russell did on the 1946 act but recognized that significant improvements were needed. After noting that only a third of American children living in families making less than $2000 a year were able to participate in the program, Talmadge said: &quot;We must use food as a tool of education. A child cannot learn if he is hungry. It has been the experience of school administrators in economically deprived areas that there is a marked improvement in school attendance when children can look forward to the prospect of a good meal at school.&quot; Major goals of Talmadge&#x27;s new proposal were to provide funding for equipment; increase the required level of support from states; allow the &quot;lunch to follow the child&quot;, letting students from low-income families that lived in higher-income areas remain eligible for the program; establish the National Advisory Council on Child Nutrition; and give needy children special assistance. The amendments for these purposes became law on May 14, 1970.

When Allen Ellender assumed chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee after Russell&#x27;s death in January 1971, Talmadge became chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, a position he held until leaving office in 1981.

Talmadge&#x27;s elevation to Agriculture Committee Chairman came at a time when many analysts were forecasting that the world&#x27;s need for food would soon outstrip its productive capacity. Under Talmadge&#x27;s leadership, the Senate Agriculture Committee confronted these problems throughout the 1970s. Talmadge oversaw the passage of several bills that more than doubled spending on farm programs by the end of the 1970s. In addition to the Rural Development Act of 1972, the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 (also known as the 1973 U.S. Farm Bill), which provided for commodity price support, soil conservation, and food stamp expansion for four years, passed under his chairmanship. The four-year period established a cycle that ensured the next three farm bills appeared on the congressional agenda after presidential elections, thereby preventing them from becoming entangled in election-year politics. The Food and Agriculture Act of 1977 continued the market-oriented loan and target-pricing policies of its predecessor. Title XIV of the Act confirmed the USDA&#x27;s historic role in agricultural research under the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act. The bill also made major modifications to food stamps and solidified the program as a part of the Farm Bill.

Also in 1977, as a result of Senate committee reorganization and in recognition of the Agriculture Committee&#x27;s increased role in addressing hunger and nutrition, growing spending for federally supported child nutrition (which rose from $2.4 billion to more than $8 billion during the decade), and increase of staff size (rising from seven in 1971 to 32 in 1980), the committee&#x27;s name was changed to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. This was the first change to the committee&#x27;s name since adding &quot;Forestry&quot; in 1884.

In 1968, Talmadge faced the first of his three Republican challengers for his Senate seat. E. Earl Patton, later a member of the Georgia State Senate, received 256,796 votes (22.5 percent) to Talmadge&#x27;s 885,103 (77.3 percent). A real estate developer, Patton was the first Georgia Republican to run for the U.S. Senate since the Reconstruction era, when most Republicans were African-American freedmen. He was a sign of the shifting white electorate in the South, as white suburbanites moved into the Republican Party.

Talmadge ran a disciplined office, requiring his staff to respond to every constituent letter within 24 hours of receipt. In 1969, he hired Curtis Lee Atkinson as an administrative aide, making Atkinson the first African-American hired to work on a Southern senator&#x27;s personal staff since Reconstruction.

In 1973, Talmadge was appointed to the Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities (better known as the United States Senate Watergate Committee), which investigated members of the Nixon administration. He served on the committee until its final report was issued in June 1974. Talmadge&#x27;s service on the committee is generally considered the high-water mark of his time as a U.S. senator.

==Denunciation==
Late in his Senate career, Talmadge became embroiled in a financial scandal. After an extensive Senate investigation, on October 11, 1979, the Senate voted 81–15 to &quot;denounce&quot; Talmadge for &quot;improper financial conduct&quot; between 1973 and 1978. He was found to have accepted reimbursements of $43,435.83 for official expenses not incurred, and to have improperly reported the &quot;expenses&quot; as campaign expenditures.

After the trial, he faced significant opposition in the state&#x27;s Democratic primary for the first time in 24 years. Lieutenant Governor Zell Miller challenged Talmadge in the primary with the support of liberals disenchanted with Talmadge&#x27;s conservatism. Though Talmadge won the primary runoff against Miller, his ethical conduct was a significant issue and he was defeated by the Republican nominee, former state GOP chairman Mack Mattingly. It was believed that the bruising primary battle with Miller left Talmadge weakened for the general election.

==Divorce==
In 1977, following a long period of personal troubles, including self-admitted alcoholism, which spiraled out of control after his son, Bobby, drowned in 1975, Talmadge filed for divorce from his wife, Betty. The Talmadges reached a divorce settlement in 1978, with Betty receiving $150,000 in cash and 100 acres of their Lovejoy plantation. She was also allowed to use the remaining 1,200 acres on the plantation. Betty testified against Talmadge in 1980 during the Senate investigation into his finances.

==Later life==
After his defeat, Talmadge retired to his home; his plantation and mansion were now in his ex-wife Betty&#x27;s possession. In 1984, he married Lynda Pierce. He lived on for more than two decades, dying at 88. Talmadge and Betty, who eventually reconciled and remained on respectful terms, had two sons together, Herman E. Talmadge Jr., and Robert Shingler Talmadge. Betty Talmadge died in 2005, surrounded by family, on her estate. At the time of his death, Herman Talmadge was the earliest serving former governor.

<text>Lennox &quot;Boogsie&quot; Sharpe (born 28 October 1953 in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago) is a successful and popular composer and arranger of steelpan music. 
==Biography==
Sharpe began his career with Starlift steelband, where he worked as a co-arranger with Ray Holman. He is most strongly associated with the Phase II Pan Groove Steel Orchestra, a band he has taken to several finals of the Panorama steelband competition, as well as winning the first place in 1987 and 1988. Sharpe does not teach steelpan privately one-on-one; instead, he teaches it publicly at the panyard.

Sharpe started to play steelpan when he was just four years old. He used to play with the Invaders, then he went to Starlift, the steelband with which Ray Holman was taking the revolutionary step of composing music specifically for the instrument. Sharpe wanted to continue what Ray Holman had started by starting his own steelband in 1972.

In 2020, the University of the West Indies awarded Sharpe an Honorary Doctor of Letters for steelpan composition, arrangement, and performance.

Sharpe was married to the very talented Janet Hoating, an accomplished pianist who attended the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Music School under the tutorship of the late Amy Bartholomew.

<doc id="950611" wikidata="Q3529111" url="?curid=950611" title="Steve Harmison">
<text>Stephen James Harmison, (born 23 October 1978) is an English former first-class cricketer, who played all formats of the game. Primarily a fast bowler, he represented England in 63 Tests, 58 ODIs, and 2 T20s. He also played county cricket for Durham and Yorkshire.

He made his Test and ODI debut for England in 2002, and achieved modest success in these early stages of his career, showing promise as a capable strike bowler for England. This was borne out during the tour of the West Indies in 2003–04, where he produced some of his finest bowling and went on to become the highest wicket-taker in the series. He followed it up by playing a vital role in England&#x27;s victory in the 2005 Ashes series, and was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2005. At the time, he was regarded as one of the world&#x27;s best fast bowlers. Harmison&#x27;s performance following the 2005 Ashes victory was inconsistent and he announced his retirement from ODIs in 2006. His problems were compounded by niggling fitness worries and intense competition for a place in the English team. Although he came out of ODI retirement in 2008, his place in the squad was never permanent, ultimately leading to his being dropped since 2009. His last Test for England was the final test of the 2009 Ashes series, and he played his last ODI against West Indies in the same year. He formally announced his retirement from the game in October 2013.

Harmison&#x27;s success during his prime was attributed to his ability to extract bounce from any pitch – mainly due to his height being 6&#x27;4&quot; – and his ability to swing the ball while maintaining speeds of over 90 mph. However, his lack of consistency often led to lethal spells being mixed up with equally bad bowling (a notable example is the opening ball of the 2006 Ashes, which he bowled straight to second slip, resulting in a wide that media commentators dubbed &quot;the worst ball in history&quot;). Nevertheless, his ability with the ball was never questioned; in 2007, former Australian cricketer Shane Warne named Harmison in his list of 50 greatest cricketers, stating: &quot;on his day, he is one of the most awkward bowlers [to face] in the world&quot;.

After retiring from cricket, Harmison managed his hometown football club, Ashington, between 2015 and 2017.

==Personal life==
Harmison was born and brought up in Ashington, Northumberland, and is the eldest of 3 brothers and 1 sister (the youngest, Ben Harmison, who latterly played first-class cricket for Kent, and formerly played for Harmison&#x27;s side, Durham.)

Harmison currently lives in Ashington with his wife Hayley and their three daughters Emily, Abbie and Isabel, and their son, Charlie. A family man by nature, Harmison admitted to homesickness and missing his family each time the England team went on tour; in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2005, he stated:

&quot;I have a family. I have kids that need me around and they will dictate the decisions I make on my career...My international career will finish when my family needs me to be around a bit more.&quot;

He still remains a huge fan of football, and is a lifelong supporter of Newcastle United F.C.

Harmison has suffered from clinical depression from an early age, but hid it as homesickness during his England career.

==Early life==
As a teenager, Harmison played for his local football club, Ashington A.F.C. and Ashington Hirst Progressive, before deciding to concentrate on cricket.

==County career==
Harmison made his first-class debut for Durham in 1996. He played an important role in Durham&#x27;s first County Championship triumph in 2008, taking 60 wickets in that season at an average of 22.66. Harmison observed, &quot;The [2005] Ashes takes some beating, because of the nature of that series win, but behind that, I don&#x27;t think there is a prouder moment in my career.&quot;. Durham took their second title assisted by Harmison the following year. He played his last first-class match during a brief loan period with Yorkshire in 2012.

==International career==
===Initial selection===
Steve Harmison was first selected for an England squad in May 2000 during the tour to England by Zimbabwe, but did not play. As part of an ECB National Academy touring team that also contained Andrew Strauss, Ian Bell and Rob Key, Harmison showed clear signs of his ability in the tour of Australia in 2001–02. In August 2002, Harmison made his Test match debut at Trent Bridge against India, replacing the injured Simon Jones.

Originally lacking somewhat in control, he bowled seven consecutive wides in the first match of the tour of Australia, against the ACB Chairman&#x27;s XI&#x27;s at Lilac Hill in 2002. However, promising performances later in the tour saw him named in the World Cup squad, although he did not take to the field in any of the matches. He was then awarded with a six-month central contract by the ECB, but this was not renewed in September 2003.

Despite media complaints about his ability, he was named in the England squad for the winter tour to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, partially due to injuries to other players. Harmison gave a man-of-the-match performance in the opening Test against Bangladesh, taking 9 wickets for 79 on a slow wicket, before succumbing to a back injury and missing the matches against Sri Lanka. Despite the injury, he&#x27;d done enough to be selected for the winter tour to the West Indies, and it was there he sealed his arrival, taking 7 wickets at the cost of just 12 runs as the West Indies collapsed to their lowest ever Test total of 47 all out. Harmison went on to win the Man-of-the-Series award after taking 23 wickets in the four Tests.
===West Indies in 2004===
With the West Indies touring England in 2004, it was expected that Harmison, who had also shone in the three-match Test series against New Zealand earlier in 2004, would again be England&#x27;s lead bowler, and the West Indies captain Brian Lara went as far as suggesting that England had no plan B after Harmison. However, Harmison was outshone by spin bowler Ashley Giles for the first three Tests, before he took 9 wickets in the final Test match. In that final match, he also punished the West Indies bowling with the bat, hitting three sixes and three fours in a brief innings ending at 34 not out. Harmison&#x27;s bowling performance in this match took him to the top of the Pricewaterhousecoopers cricket ratings. In 2004, Harmison took 67 wickets in just 13 matches, at a superb average of 23.92.

Harmison disappointed with the ball on the 2004–05 England tour of South Africa, taking just 9 wickets in the Test series at the extremely high average of 73.22. During this series, he spoke frankly about his homesickness on foreign tours. However, his solid performances with the bat, including an innings high score of 42 in the 3rd Test, led some commentators to note, not altogether jokingly, that he was now making a case to be considered a tail all-rounder. Despite these disappointments, he was still named as one of five cricketers of the year by Wisden Cricketer&#x27;s Almanack in 2005. For his performances in 2004, he was named in the World Test XI by ICC.

===Ashes 2005===
In summer 2005 Harmison was part of the England team that regained The Ashes from Australia. He started the series well, with a hostile opening spell on the first day of the 1st Test, taking five wickets, including that of Australia captain Ricky Ponting. An incident in this innings in which Harmison cut Ricky Ponting&#x27;s face with a short ball caused controversy because of the apparently uncaring response of England players to Ponting&#x27;s injury, a response about which Harmison subsequently expressed regret.

Although England lost the first test and Harmison was later outshone by Flintoff and Jones, he exerted pressure and claimed important wickets throughout the series as England fought back. His most important and dazzling wicket, some might say, was the slower-ball yorker with which he bowled Michael Clarke, described by Mark Nicholas, commentating for Channel 4, as &quot;one of the great balls&quot;. Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Flintoff believed he had the second-worst split-fingered slower ball in the squad, after Flintoff. Harmison also took the final wicket of Michael Kasprowicz the next day, caught behind from a bouncer by Geraint Jones for England to win by the wafer thin margin of only two runs. England had been massive favourites overnight, but Australia, needing over a hundred to win with only two wickets left had almost pulled a victory from the very jaws of defeat thanks to the tail end efforts of Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Kasprowicz until Harmison struck.

===Decline in form===
In July 2006, during the series against Pakistan, Harmison took 6/19 off just 13 overs in the first innings as Pakistan were skittled for just 119. In the second he again shared the 10 wickets with Monty Panesar, taking 5/57. He thus took his first 10 wicket haul in a match, taking 11/76. This came in his 45th Test match, and was the best match bowling figures at Old Trafford since Jim Laker&#x27;s 19/90, exactly 50 years previously.

During the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy Harmison&#x27;s form came under scrutiny, and he was dropped from England&#x27;s final match against the West Indies. In November 2006, Harmison bowled the first ball of the eagerly awaited 2006–07 Ashes series at the Gabba in Brisbane, but erred by bowling a ball so wide that it went to Andrew Flintoff at second slip. This incident became so infamous that some commentators began referring to any similarly wide delivery as &#x27;a Harmison&#x27;. After another below par performance in Adelaide he would find some form in Perth with 4/48 in the 1st innings.

===ODI retirement===
On 21 December 2006, three months before the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Harmison announced his retirement from One Day International cricket after being left out of the squad for the one-day series in Australia. In October 2007, Harmison travelled to South Africa to play domestic cricket before heading to Sri Lanka as part of the England Test squad. After a shaky start, however, he suffered a back injury on the first day of the second warm up match, having taken one wicket. He was not included in the squad for the first test, however he took three wickets in the second. Harmison was then dropped from the Test side after the first game of the subsequent series in New Zealand. On 21 August 2008, it was announced that Harmison would return to playing One Day International cricket against South Africa.

===Return in Tests===
On 7 August 2008 Harmison returned to the England Test team for the Fourth Test match versus South Africa. He took two wickets for 49 runs in helping England to dismiss South Africa for 194 on the first day of the match. Harmison&#x27;s first ball (the first ball of the match) nearly took a wicket (see picture). In England&#x27;s first innings Harmison hit a career high Test match score of 49 not out (59 balls,8 fours). He ran teammate Monty Panesar out trying to reach 50. After the Test series on 21 August, Harmison came out of ODI retirement after being persuaded by the new England captain, Kevin Pietersen. On his ODI return versus South Africa on 22 August, he took two wickets for 43 runs, this was crucial in England winning the match.

Harmison lost his place in the Test team again the following winter during a series in the West Indies. However, on 7 August 2009, exactly one year after his previous return, Harmison was selected to play in the 4th Ashes Test at Headingley, replacing the injured Andrew Flintoff. In this Test, he equalled Mike Atherton &amp; then Monty Panesar&#x27;s record for the most Test ducks scored by an Englishman (20), caught behind off Peter Siddle as England collapsed to 102 all out against Australia&#x27;s seam bowling attack. Whereas Atherton had played 115 tests, Harmison achieved the feat in his 62nd test. He also took the wicket of Simon Katich caught in the gully for a duck in the second over of Australia&#x27;s innings.

He had bowled well to a supportive audience, and should have taken the wicket of Michael Clarke late on in the first day but the appeal was turned down. He went on to take the wicket of Australian keeper Brad Haddin. In his second innings Harmison made 19 not out off 28 balls but could not prevent the Australians from totalling 445 and proceeding to an innings victory. Harmison went on to play in the 5th Test at the Oval; on the final day of the series, Harmison claimed the three penultimate wickets to fall, including those of Peter Siddle and Stuart Clark with consecutive deliveries, both caught after attempting to play to the leg side, to create a unique opportunity to win the Ashes with a hat-trick (Ben Hilfenhaus successfully blocked the hat-trick ball). England won by 197 runs to take the series 2–1.

===Late career and retirement===
Harmison announced his retirement from all forms of games on 6 October 2013.

==After cricket and life in football==
Following his retirement from cricket, Harmison has featured on Sky Sports&#x27; cricket programming as a pundit and commentator. However, on 8 February 2015, Harmison was appointed manager of Ashington in the ninth-tier of English football. He resigned from the role in October 2017. In July 2022, Harmison was named as a Talksport correspondent, covering Newcastle United matches and media.

<doc id="950638" wikidata="Q3045582" url="?curid=950638" title="Five Power Defence Arrangements">
<text>The Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) are a series of bilateral defence relationships established by a series of multi-lateral agreements between Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, all of which are Commonwealth members that once belonged to the British Empire.

Signed in 1971, the FPDA consists of the five powers consulting each other &quot;immediately&quot; in the event of threat or an armed attack on any of the FPDA members for the purpose of deciding what measures should be taken, jointly or separately in response.

There is no specific commitment to intervene militarily, and the agreement is merely consultative. The Five Powers Defence Arrangements do not refer to exclusive economic zones (EEZ), and the enforcement of a state&#x27;s EEZ rights is a matter for that state, which may request the assistance of other states in so doing.

==Foundations &amp; principles==
The FPDA’s founding principles continue to form the bedrock of activities and exercises. First, as a defensive arrangement, the FPDA should maintain a non-threatening posture to avoid rousing sensitivities in the region. Second, as a multilateral security arrangement, the FPDA should proceed at a pace comfortable to all, cognisant of multilateral, bilateral and national sensitivities. Third, given the constantly changing strategic environment, the FPDA should continually develop and evolve to remain relevant as a security arrangement.

At the 10th FPDA Defence Ministers’ Meeting in 2017, the founding principles were contemporised to the ‘3Rs’. The 3Rs complement the founding principles and together they continue to guide the FPDA decision making and activity.

First, the FPDA should not deviate from its Remit in contributing to the external defence of Malaysia and Singapore. Second, the FPDA should develop and evolve to ensure its Relevance as a regional security arrangement at a pace comfortable to all. Third, the FPDA should maintain its purpose and portrayal as a defensive arrangement to provide Reassurance to the region.

==History==

The FPDA was set up following the termination of the United Kingdom&#x27;s defence guarantees of Malaya under the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement, as a result of the UK&#x27;s decision in 1967 to withdraw its armed forces east of Suez on 1 November 1971. Under the Five Powers Defence Arrangements, the five member-nations of (Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom) agreed to consult one another in the event of armed aggression against Malaysia and Singapore. The 1971 Joint Communiqué states: 

“In the event of any form of armed attack externally organised or supported or the threat of such attack against Malaysia and Singapore, their governments would immediately consult together for the purpose of deciding what measures should be taken jointly or separately in relation to such attack or threat”.

In line with the FPDA Joint Communiqué of 16 April 1971, two councils, the Joint Consultative Council and the Air Defence Council, were established. The Joint Consultative Council provided a forum for regular consultations at the senior official-level on matters relating to the defence arrangements. The Air Defence Council was responsible for the functioning of the Headquarters Integrated Air Defence System (HQIADS). 

With the expansion and complexity of FPDA exercises and the move towards joint and combined exercises over the years, the two councils were amalgamated in terms of their functions and tasks as well as memberships to improve the management and coordination of FPDA activities. The merged Council was named the FPDA Consultative Council (FCC).

===Air defence===
During the early years of FPDA, the arrangements were focused on the air defence of Malaysia and Singapore. Commander IADS held the responsibility and authority for operational air defence. By 1990, Malaysia and Singapore’s military capacity progressed, and the FPDA’s focus shifted towards training and support.

The FPDA based at RMAF Butterworth under the command of an Australian Air Vice-Marshal (2-star). RMAF Butterworth, was under the control of the Royal Australian Air Force until 1988, and is now run by the Royal Malaysian Air Force but hosts rotating detachments of aircraft and personnel from all five countries.

===Area defence system===
In 1981, the five powers organised the first annual land and naval exercises. Since 1997, the naval and air exercises have been combined. 

In the 1990s, land exercises were added to the exercise programme and by 2000 the FPDA was actively pursuing the development of a capability for joint and combined operations in which air defence would contribute only as part of broader air, land, and maritime operations.

In 2001, HQ IADS was redesignated Headquarters Integrated &quot;Area&quot; Defence System. It now has personnel from all three branches of the armed services, and co-ordinates the annual five-power naval and air exercises, while moving towards the fuller integration of land elements. An annual FPDA Defence Chiefs&#x27; Conference (FDCC) is hosted by either Malaysia or Singapore, and is the highest military professional forum of the FPDA and serves as an important platform for dialogue and exchange of views among the Defence Chiefs. There is also a Five Powers Defence Arrangements Ministerial Meeting (FDMM).
John Moore, then Minister of Defence of Australia said, &quot;As an established multilateral security framework, the FPDA has a unique role in Asia. It is of strategic benefit to all member nations and, in Australia&#x27;s view, to the wider Asia-Pacific region.&quot; Malaysia&#x27;s CDF, former General (GEN) Tan Sri Dato&#x27; Sri Zulkifeli Bin Mohd Zin concurred: &quot;We can help each other... and cooperate with one another.&quot;

In the latest New Zealand defence White Paper released in June 2016, it was outlined that given New Zealand was a longstanding member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, it would, &quot;meet its commitments should Malaysia or Singapore be subject to a military attack.&quot;

===40th anniversary===
On 1 November 2011, Singapore hosted FPDA&#x27;s 40th anniversary celebrations, with the defence ministers, aircraft and servicemen from all five signatory countries converging on Changi Air Base (East) to participate in the event. Later, a gala dinner was hosted by Singaporean Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen at Singapore&#x27;s Istana whereupon they called on Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong to discuss a multitude of issues. Codenamed &quot;Exercise Bersama Lima&quot;, the three days joint exercise tested the readiness and co-operation between all participating countries and concluded on 4 November 2011.

===50th anniversary===
On 18 October 2021, FPDA celebrated its 50th anniversary with joint air and naval displays involving the ships and aircraft of the member countries. These were observed by Singaporean Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and the High Commissioners of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Prior to this, a two-week joint exercise had taken place, known as Exercise Bersama Gold in honour of the FPDA&#x27;s golden jubilee. It was the first FPDA exercise held since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and involved 2,600 military personnel, air and maritime sea training exercises, and a virtual jungle warfare workshop. Participating ships included the Australian amphibious assault ship and New Zealand&#x27;s replenishment tanker. The British destroyer also took part in the exercise but missed the final days due to technical issues. Whilst in the region at the time, did not participate in the exercise, likely due to the presence of United States Marine Corps on the aircraft carrier.

===50 years and beyond===
The five member-nations continue to contribute to combined and joint exercises, and training opportunities that focus on high-end conventional warfighting, while also being flexible in responding to the changing security landscape. This includes expanding maritime security, counter-terrorism, HADR, and non-combatant evacuation operations. 

Additionally, new and emerging capabilities will become more prevalent over the next decade, such as cybersecurity and unmanned aircraft systems. Progress on developing capacity in these areas will continue to be made at a pace comfortable to all member-nations.

===FPDA website===
Minister for Defence Dr Ng Eng Hen hosted the 12th Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) Defence Ministers&#x27; Meeting [FDMM] in Singapore on the 31th May 2024. The meeting was attended by Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles, Malaysian Defence Minister Dato&#x27; Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin, New Zealand Defence Minister Judith Collins KC, and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Director General (Security Policy) Paul Wyatt.

The official FPDA website, https://www.fivepowerdefencearrangements.org/ was also launched on the FDMM, that seeks to give additional insight to the public on how the FPDA functions as a defensive arrangement aimed at building trust and confidence in the region.

The FPDA Website serves to promote the FPDA as an authoritative source on its history, supporting the guiding principles of; Remit; Relevance; and Reassurance. It seeks to demonstrate the FPDA’s relevance as a security arrangement, with accurate information and provide a comprehensive story of the FPDA.

==Exercises==

Since its formation, the FPDA has conducted multilateral military exercises involving all five member states with operational command alternating between Singapore and Malaysia. These began as intermittent Air Defence Exercises (ADEX) in the 1970s before land and sea components were added in the 1980s. They have since become yearly fixtures and have grown in complexity, combining air, sea and land components to address both conventional and non-conventional threats. Whilst most exercises take place off the coast of Malaysia and Singapore, they have also extended into the South China Sea. Non-FPDA representatives are often invited to observe the drills.

FPDA exercises focus on the external defence of Malaysia and Singapore, and high-end conventional warfighting serials. Over a five-year cycle, the FPDA conducts a variety of field training exercises (FTX) and command post exercises (CPX).

Examples of FPDA exercises include:
* Exercise Bersatu Lima – The first major exercise held in 1972.

* Exercise Platypus – The first land-based FPDA exercise which was held in Australia in 1981.

* Exercise Starfish – One of the first FPDA naval exercises, inaugurated in 1981. It has been replaced by Exercise Bersama Lima.

* Exercise Flying Fish – The first combined air, sea and land exercise which was first held in 1997. With 39 warships and 160 combat aircraft, the inaugural exercise in 1997 was one of the largest to date and took place over 13 days.

* Exercise Bersama Padu – The name of this exercise translates to &quot;Together United&quot; in Malay. The inaugural exercise in 2006 took place in Singapore and the South China Sea and consisted of 21 warships, 85 aircraft and 1 submarine as well as ground components. Operational planning took place at Paya Lebar Air Base, Singapore.

* Exercise Suman Warrior – A land-based exercise which originated in the 1990s and takes place in Australia and New Zealand. SUMAN WARRIOR is an annual land-based CPX solely to exercise FPDA land forces up to Brigade level. This exercise is unique in that it is hosted by each of the five nations and is the only FPDA exercise to occur outside of Singapore and Malaysia.

The name SUMAN is an acronym from the first letters of the five nations; the exercise has occurred since 1990.

* Exercise Suman Protector – Inaugurated in 2007, it is held every five years as a culminating activity in the FPDA&#x27;s exercise cycle. SUMAN PROTECTOR occurs every 5 years and is the culminating activity in the exercise programme. Hosted by Malaysia or Singapore, it is a Tier 3 operational CPX designed to exercise an FPDA Combined and Joint Task Force headquarters to plan for and execute a military operation for the defence of Malaysia and Singapore against a conventional threat. Up to 400 personnel are involved at the headquarters, and the exercise also allows deeper engagement with other government agencies and non-governmental organisations.

* Exercise Bersama Shield – Formerly the Integrated Air Defence System air defence exercise until 2004. BERSAMA SHIELD is a tactical integration exercise for FPDA air and maritime forces at the tactical-level. Hosted by HQIADS, the exercise occurs annually in Malaysia and Singapore, and routinely involves over 50 aircraft, 3-6 ships and several ground-based air defence units. The exercise has been held annually since 2004, evolving from earlier FPDA exercise iterations such as STARDEX, FLYING FISH, and STARFISH.

* Exercise Bersama Lima – Translates to &quot;Together Five&quot; in Malay. These exercises were inaugurated in 2004 and have taken place on a yearly basis ever since. BERSAMA LIMA is a tactical-level exercise with an operational-level headquarters aimed at exercising FPDA combined and joint forces, including a land element. It is planned and led by the Malaysian Armed Forces or Singapore Armed Forces in alternate years. In addition to augmentation at the Combined and Joint HQ, BERSAMA LIMA routinely sees 60-80 aircraft, 10-15 ships, 1-2 submarines and a Land Component.

* Exercise Bersama Gold – A replacement of Exercise Bersama Lima to mark the FPDA&#x27;s golden jubilee in October 2021.

<text>Cinnabon, Inc., is an American chain of baked goods stores and kiosks, normally found in areas with high pedestrian traffic such as malls, airports and rest stops. The company&#x27;s signature item is the cinnamon roll. As of December 2017, there are more than 1,200 Cinnabon bakeries operating in 48 countries. Its headquarters are in Sandy Springs, Georgia, United States.

The company is co-owned—with Schlotzsky&#x27;s, Carvel, Moe&#x27;s Southwest Grill, McAlister&#x27;s Deli, Jamba, and Auntie Anne&#x27;s brands—by GoTo Foods (formerly Focus Brands), an affiliate of private equity firm Roark Capital Group, based in Sandy Springs, Georgia, operating over 5,000 stores.

==History==

The first Cinnabon opened on December 4, 1985, in Federal Way, Washington at SeaTac Mall, now called The Commons at Federal Way. Cinnabon was an offshoot of the Seattle-based Restaurants Unlimited chain, majority owned by Rich Komen, with minority partner and CEO Ray Lindstrom at the helm. Komen and Lindstrom wanted to create the perfect cinnamon roll, eventually hiring Jerilyn Brusseau to finalize the recipe since Brusseau was famous for her baking in the Seattle area. The first bakery began by serving only its cinnamon rolls with a sign touting &quot;World Famous Cinnamon Rolls&quot;. Cinnabon&#x27;s first franchise-operated store opened in August 1986 just outside of Philadelphia at the King of Prussia Mall. Cinnabon stores today can also be found in gas stations, universities, rapid transit stations, casinos, and amusement parks.

Cinnabon was bought by AFC Enterprises, Inc. in 1998 for $65 million. In 2004, AFC Enterprises, Inc., sold Cinnabon for $30.3 million to Focus Brands, Inc., which is owned by the Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group. The headquarters moved to Greater Atlanta in 1999. In November 2020, British retail group EG Group announced a partnership with Cinnabon to open 150 branded stores in the UK over five years. In May 2024, the UK partnership would then be transferred to EG On the Move.

On October 8, 2018, Cinnabon partnered with Pizza Hut to release mini cinnamon rolls labeled &quot;Cinnabon Mini Rolls&quot; in Pizza Hut (also known as MiniBons outside of Pizza Hut). These cinnamon rolls continue to be available at Pizza Hut. In 2020, Pizza Hut brought back the Triple Treat Box, containing two medium one-topping pizzas, five breadsticks, and ten Cinnabon Mini Rolls.

<text>Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc. is an American multinational chain of fried chicken restaurants founded in 1972 in New Orleans and headquartered in Miami. It is currently a subsidiary of Toronto-based Restaurant Brands International. , Popeyes has 3,705 restaurants, which are located in more than 46 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 30 countries worldwide. About 50 locations are company-owned; the other ~98% are franchised.

==History==
Popeyes was formed in Arabi, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana, in St. Bernard Parish. It first opened its doors on June 12, 1972, as &quot;Chicken on the Run&quot;. Owner Al Copeland (1944–2008) wanted to compete with Kentucky Fried Chicken, but his restaurant failed after several months. Copeland reopened the restaurant four days later as Popeyes Mighty Good Chicken. By 1975, the company had been renamed as Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken. Copeland started franchising his restaurant in 1976, beginning in Louisiana. The chain expanded to Canada in 1984, and opened its 500th restaurant in 1985. B. P. Newman of Laredo, Texas, acquired several franchises in Texas and surrounding states. Two hundred additional locations were added during a period of slower expansion.

By 1990, Copeland Enterprises was in default on $391 million in debts it had taken on in its 1989 purchase of Church&#x27;s, a rival fast food chain also focusing in fried chicken, and by April 1991, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. In October 1992, the court approved a plan by a group of Copeland&#x27;s creditors that resulted in the creation of America&#x27;s Favorite Chicken Company, Inc. (AFC) to serve as the new parent company for Popeyes and Church&#x27;s. AFC went public in 2001 with initial public offering (IPO) of $142,818,479, and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker symbol AFCE. On December 29, 2004, AFC sold Church&#x27;s to Arcapita (formerly Crescent Capital Investments) retaining Popeyes.

On August 8, 2000, Popeyes announced a franchise development plan/agreement that included 35 new restaurant locations around Australia in a bid to solidify their presence within the Asia Pacific region. All were to be located in Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales.

On January 21, 2014, AFC was renamed as Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, Inc., and its NASDAQ ticker symbol was changed to PLKI.

On June 17, 2014, Popeyes announced it had re-acquired full control of its seasonings, recipes, and other proprietary food preparation techniques from Diversified Foods &amp; Seasonings, which remained under the control of Al Copeland and his estate after the creditor sale of Popeyes to AFC. Popeyes had continued to license the seasonings, recipes, and techniques from DF&amp;S for a yearly &#x27;spice royalty&#x27;, before buying them outright for $43 million. DF&amp;S remains the main supplier for Popeyes until at least 2029.

=== Acquisition by Restaurant Brands International ===
On February 21, 2017, Restaurant Brands International announced a deal to buy Popeyes for US$1.8 billion. On March 27, 2017, the deal closed with RBI purchasing Popeyes at $79 per share via Orange, Inc, an indirect subsidiary of RBI.

===Name===
Alvin C. Copeland claimed he named the stores after the fictional detective Jimmy &quot;Popeye&quot; Doyle (portrayed by Gene Hackman) in the 1971 film &quot;The French Connection&quot;, which came out a year before the chain was founded, and not the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor. 

However, the company&#x27;s early brand became deeply tied to the cartoon star with its sponsorship of the &quot;Popeye &amp; Pals&quot; children&#x27;s show in New Orleans, and the character appeared on items from packaging to racing boats.

The chain later acquired rights to use Popeye the Sailor for marketing and used this for 35 years. In late November 2012, AFC announced the mutual termination of their licensing contract with King Features Syndicate, effectively ending their association with the Popeye characters.

The name is spelled &quot;Popeyes&quot;, without the apostrophe commonly used by other restaurant chains such as McDonald&#x27;s and Hardee&#x27;s. Copeland claimed facetiously that he was &quot;too poor&quot; to afford an apostrophe.

==Products==

Popeyes serves chicken dishes in mild and spicy flavors and offers sides such as red beans and rice, Cajun fries, mashed potatoes with Cajun-style gravy, Cajun rice, macaroni &amp; cheese, biscuits, and coleslaw. In addition to chicken, Popeyes also serves seafood entrées such as shrimp and catfish. On October 30, 2006, AFC announced that Popeyes planned to introduce a trans fat-free biscuit as well as french fries containing one gram of trans fat by year-end. On November 18, 2011, AFC announced that, for the Thanksgiving holiday, Popeyes would release a Fried Turducken sandwich that would show off the first ever Turducken patty. On July 29, 2013, AFC began offering a special entree of fried chicken strips dipped in waffle batter, which was already a proven success in some markets. For a limited time only in 2017, Popeyes offered &quot;Sweet and Crunchy&quot; chicken, fried chicken tenders coated in shortbread cookie breading. In 2021, Popeyes introduced a flounder sandwich.

===Chicken sandwich===

Popeyes began selling a chicken sandwich in August 2019 to compete with Chick-fil-A&#x27;s similar flagship sandwich. The company first launched the sandwich at Long Beach restaurant Sweet Dixie Kitchen, a locally-famous spot that had become known for reselling fried chicken that it had purchased at Popeyes. The sandwich launched nationwide to all locations in the US on August 12, 2019, but had some advance openings at the beginning of 2019.

The marketing campaign, designed by advertising agency GSD&amp;M started on August 12, 2019, with a tweet on Popeyes&#x27; Twitter feed. The new sandwich went viral immediately and prompted responses from nearly every fast food chain including McDonald&#x27;s, Chick-Fil-A, and Wendy&#x27;s. Popeyes reported a 103% increase in traffic in the days following the launch of the sandwich. The sandwich helped Popeyes gather an estimated $23 million in free publicity since its launch. Popeyes stores routinely sold out of the sandwich and experienced long lines, and a man outside of a Maryland Popeyes chain was stabbed to death during a dispute over a cutting in line for a chicken sandwich. Locations across the US were supposed to have enough materials to last them until the end of September. Instead, restaurants were almost entirely sold out after less than two weeks. On August 27, approximately two weeks after the launch, Popeyes announced that it had officially sold out of the chicken sandwich across the country. One person in Tennessee sued Popeyes, claiming that his inability to get the sandwich has caused him to be &quot;hustled out of money&quot;, making Popeyes guilty of &quot;false advertising&quot; along with &quot;deceptive business practices&quot;. On October 28, 2019, Popeyes announced that the chicken sandwich would return to locations across the US on November 3.
Popeyes chicken sandwich is made of buttermilk-battered white meat on a brioche bun along with pickles and mayonnaise or spicy Cajun spread.

In September 2020, Popeyes&#x27; chicken sandwich went on sale in Canada.

==Style and marketing==

The restaurants&#x27; exteriors have a distinctive orange and white color scheme. The original locations had a black lava rock exterior with a red shingled roof. Most older locations have covered the rock exterior to conform with the current orange stucco appearance. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company occasionally licensed characters from the Popeye comic strip to use in its advertising. TV and radio ads often use New Orleans-style music, along with the trademark &quot;Love That Chicken&quot; jingle sung by New Orleans funk and R&amp;B musician Dr. John.

In 2009, Popeyes introduced &quot;Annie the Chicken Queen&quot;, a fictitious, upbeat, African-American Popeyes chef played by actress Deidrie Henry. The character is meant to be &quot;honest, vibrant, youthful and authentic&quot; according to Dick Lynch, Popeyes Chief Marketing Officer. &quot;Everyone has a relative or a good friend who will give it to them straight, and that&#x27;s what Annie is all about&quot;, Lynch said.

Popeyes has sponsored various NASCAR drivers since 2000. That year, NASCAR Busch Series driver Rich Bickle was sponsored by the company for six races, while Mark McFarland received a one-race deal in the same series the following season. In March 2018, Tyler Matthews made his NASCAR Camping World Truck Series debut in the No. 99 Popeyes truck at Martinsville Speedway, and the company also sponsored Brennan Poole and Vizion Motorsports for that year&#x27;s Truck Series season finale at Homestead–Miami Speedway.

Popeyes has made use of various slogans in television advertisements, most notably &quot;Love that chicken from Popeyes&quot;.

==International franchises==
Some international franchises, such as the ones located in Germany and Japan, are located only on US military installations and are generally not accessible to the local civilian public.

Popeyes arrived in the Philippines in 2001 but left in 2007 due to a problem with the franchisor; it later returned with a new deal with Kuya J Group in 2018 and opened its first branch in Pasig on May 19, 2019. Popeyes opened their first store in China on May 15, 2020, and in March 2021, it announced plans to open stores in Mexico and the United Kingdom, with the first restaurant in the latter country, locating at Westfield Stratford City opening on November 20, 2021. Restaurant Brands International signed a master franchise and development agreement with Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks on March 24, 2021, to operate Popeyes restaurants in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The first Popeyes restaurant in South Asia opened in Bambalapitiya, Sri Lanka on February 25, 2021.

In December 2020, Popeyes announced that it would be closing all locations in South Korea due to poor sales partially attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021, Popeyes signed an agreement with Romanian company Sterling Cruise to open 90 restaurants in Romania in the next 10 years, the first one opened on April 9, 2022. In January 2022, Popeyes Signed an agreement with South Korean Tuna Supplier Shilla International to open again in South Korea, the first one opened in January 2023.

Popeyes opened its first store in Indonesia in 2000 under PT Popeyes Chicken Seafood Indonesia (later taken over by PT Popindo Selera Prima in 2002) and had opened its store in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Samarinda, but the last store in Puri Indah Mall, West Jakarta closed in 2011. Popeyes returned to Indonesia under PT Sari Chicken Indonesia, an affiliate of Mitra Adiperkasa and opened its first store in Skyline Building, Central Jakarta on December 23, 2022.

In August 2023, British private equity firm TDR Capital invested into Popeyes UK. In 2024, Popeyes announced that it would be opening stores in New Zealand and Taiwan later that year. It forced a small fish and chip shop called Popeye&#x27;s Takeaways in Feilding, New Zealand, to change its name although the shop does not sell fried chicken.

<doc id="950696" wikidata="Q149612" url="?curid=950696" title="Tron (video game)">
<text>Tron is a coin-operated arcade video game manufactured and distributed by Bally Midway in 1982. The game consists of four subgames inspired by the events of the Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Tron&quot; released earlier in the summer. The lead programmer was Bill Adams with Earl Vickers programming the music. The game was a major success, with approximately 10,000 arcade cabinets sold, and it was awarded &quot;Coin-Operated Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Electronic Games&quot;.

A number of other licensed &quot;Tron&quot; games were released for home systems, but these were based directly on elements of the movie and not the arcade game. &quot;Tron&quot; was followed by an arcade sequel in 1983, &quot;Discs of Tron&quot;, which was not as successful.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Tron&quot; consists of four sub-games based on events and characters in the movie. In general, the player controls Tron, either in human form or piloting a vehicle, using an eight-way joystick for movement, a trigger button on the stick to fire (or slow down the player&#x27;s light cycle), and a rotary dial for aiming. The goal of the game is to score points and advance through the game&#x27;s twelve levels by completing each of the sub-games. Most of the 12 levels are named after programming languages: RPG, COBOL, BASIC, FORTRAN, SNOBOL, PL1, PASCAL, ALGOL, ASSEMBLY, OS, JCL, and USER. The game supports two players alternating.

At the start of each level, the player is taken to a &quot;Game Grid&quot; selection screen divided into four quadrants. The player must choose a quadrant, each of which corresponds to a different sub-game. The sub-game in each quadrant is not known to the player until it is selected. If the player fails the game and loses a life, they are taken back to this selection screen and an icon representing that game is now visible. Failure to choose a quadrant before an on-screen timer runs out results in a sub-game being chosen at random. Once the player completes a particular sub-game, it is taken out of play until the start of the next level.

The sub-games are as follows:

;I/O Tower
The player must guide Tron to the flashing circle of an Input/Output Tower within a set time limit while avoiding or destroying Grid Bugs. This game is based on the I/O Tower scene in the film, while adding the Grid Bugs as enemies (which were only briefly mentioned in the film). A bit occasionally appears on the screen and can be picked up for bonus points.

;MCP Cone
The player must break through a rotating shield wall protecting the MCP cone and enter the cone without touching any of the shield blocks. This game is based on Tron&#x27;s final battle with the MCP in the film, but changes the nature of the MCP&#x27;s shield. Bonus points are awarded for destroying every block in the shield.

;Light Cycles
In a player-vs-AI variant of the Snake game concept, the player guides Tron&#x27;s blue Light Cycle in an arena against one or more yellow opponents. The objective is to force the enemy cycles to crash into walls, jet trails, or each other, while simultaneously avoiding them. When an enemy cycle crashes, both it and its trail disappear. This game is based on the Light Cycle Arena sequence in the film, though the colors of the friendly and enemy characters are reversed. This is the only sub-game in &quot;Tron&quot; to not use the rotary dial.

;Battle Tanks
The player must guide Tron&#x27;s red battle tank through a maze and destroy all of the opposing blue enemy tanks by shooting each of them three times. The tank can warp to a random location in the maze by moving into a diamond in the center, and its shots bounce off walls or obstructions until reaching their maximum travel distance. In higher difficulty levels, the enemy tanks are replaced by red Recognizers that are much faster and attempt to collide with the player instead of shooting at him/her. This game is not based on any particular scene, but is rather based on Tank Program elements, including Clu&#x27;s failed intrusion into the ENCOM mainframe and the &quot;Space Paranoids&quot; game featured at the beginning of the film.

==Development==

Bally Midway had two different design teams submit pitches for the game. One team planned a first-person vector graphics game, while the second team suggested a collection of five minigames using existing Bally Midway technology; the second proposal was used because it had a better chance of being completed by the deadline. One of the five minigames was ultimately left out due to the time constraints.

== Reception ==
&quot;Tron&quot; was awarded &quot;Coin-Operated Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Electronic Games&quot; magazine.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 800 arcade cabinets were sold in 1982. By January 1983, it was fourth on the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts. The book &quot;The Naked Computer&quot; reported that &quot;Tron&quot; made $45,000,000 by 1983. In USgamer&#x27;s estimation 10,000 cabinets were sold and the game made more than $30,000,000 in revenue by 1983. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Even many of today&#x27;s coin-ops can&#x27;t compete with the mighty &quot;Tron&quot;.&quot;

== Records ==
The world record high score for &quot;Tron&quot; was set in July 2011 by David Cruz of Brandon, Florida. Cruz scored 14,007,645 points based on Twin Galaxies rules and settings for the game.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Discs of Tron&quot; (1983) is an arcade game which was originally intended as a fifth segment of &quot;Tron&quot; but was left out because programming was not finished in time. In it, the player engages in disc throwing combat, similar to the film sequence. &quot;Discs of Tron&quot; was not widely released.

Two clones of the game, &quot;ElecTron&quot; (1984) and &quot;Kron&quot; (1983), were released for the TRS-80 Color Computer.

The light cycles segment of &quot;Tron&quot; has led to &quot;Snake&quot; games sometimes being called &quot;Light Cycles&quot; games, despite the concept dating from 1976. Some post-&quot;Tron&quot; snake games use themes or terminology from the film.

The 2004 Game Boy Advance game &quot;Tron 2.0: Killer App&quot; contains ports of the original &quot;Tron&quot; and &quot;Discs of Tron&quot; arcade games.

&quot;Tron&quot; was released for Xbox Live Arcade in January 2008, ported by Digital Eclipse and branded by Disney Interactive.

A miniature &quot;Tron&quot; arcade cabinet showing a looping video of the game&#x27;s attract screens is featured as a toy in the &quot;Tron Legacy&quot; pinball machine, released in 2011 by Stern Pinball.

In October 2021, Arcade1Up released a recreated cabinet of the original &quot;Tron&quot; arcade game.

<text>Zanstra is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It was named after the Dutch astronomer Herman Zanstra. It lies to the southeast of the crater pair Ibn Firnas and King, and northwest of Gregory. This is a low, eroded formation that is difficult to distinguish from its surroundings. The interior floor is level and not significantly impacted.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zanstra.

<text>James Cox Aikins, (March 30, 1823 – August 6, 1904) was a Canadian politician in the 19th century. He twice served as a cabinet minister in the government of John A. Macdonald, and was the fourth Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba from 1882 to 1888.

==Early life and career==

Aikins was born in Toronto Township, Upper Canada (now Mississauga, Ontario). His father had previously converted to Methodism, and the young Aikins was educated at the Methodist-run Upper Canada Academy in Cobourg from 1840 to 1845. Upon graduation, he acquired land near Toronto and worked as a farmer.

Aikins was offered the Reform (i.e., Liberal) nomination for York West in the 1851 Canadian parliamentary election, but declined. Three years later, he was elected to the Province of Canada&#x27;s legislature for the newly formed riding of Peel as a Clear Grit (i.e., radical reformer). Cox defeated Conservative G. Wright by 865 votes to 810.

The Clear Grit faction in parliament had previously been aligned with Francis Hincks&#x27;s governing Reformers, but this alliance ended after the 1854 election. Most of Hincks&#x27;s supporters subsequently formed a new alliance with the Conservatives, while the Clear Grits formed a &quot;left opposition&quot; and attempted to reconstruct the Reform Party on their terms. Aikins was a minor figure in the Grit parliamentary ranks for the next three years but was nevertheless re-elected in 1857, with 2007 votes against 915 for his Conservative opponent. The Conservative-led alliance remained in power during these years, and Aikins remained in opposition.

Between 1856 and 1861, there were numerous debates in Peel County concerning a planned division of the riding, and the location of its new county seat. Local differences weakened the reformist cause, and Aikins was narrowly defeated by Conservative John Hillyard Cameron in the election of 1861.

In 1862, Aikins was elected to an eight-year term in the Province of Canada&#x27;s Legislative Council, an upper house with both appointed and elected members. Running as a Liberal in the Home division, he defeated his sole opponent by 2934 votes to 1559.

Aikins played only a minor role in the parliamentary debates on Canadian confederation, which he supported in principle despite concerns about the legislative means which John A. Macdonald was using to move the policy forward. After Confederation was approved, Aikins attempted to introduce legislation for an elected senate, but was ruled out-of-order by the Council&#x27;s speaker. Along with other members of the Legislative Council, he was appointed to the (unelected) Canadian Senate upon its creation in May 1867. Representing the (Ontario) Senate Division. In 1868, Aikins was offered a cabinet position in Prime Minister John A. Macdonald&#x27;s Liberal-Conservative government, but turned it down for fear of dividing the Liberal Party.

==Cabinet minister and lieutenant governor==

In 1869, Francis Hincks returned to Canadian political life by joining Macdonald&#x27;s government as a &quot;coalition Reformer&quot;. Macdonald wanted Liberal Senators William McMaster and Aikins to join Hincks in the ministry, to further broaden its appeal with the electorate; McMaster declined, but suggested that Aikins accept the offer and represent Liberal interests inside the government. Aikins was agreeable to his suggestion, and became a Minister without Portfolio on November 16. On December 8, he was appointed Secretary of State for Canada, and would continue to hold this position until the defeat of the Macdonald government on November 5, 1873. He also served as acting Secretary of State for the Provinces and Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs for one month in 1873, following the resignation of Joseph Howe.

When Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives were returned to government in 1878, Aikins was again appointed Secretary of State for Canada as the ministry&#x27;s sole &quot;coalition Reformer&quot; (the group was by this time a minor political force in Canada). On November 8, 1880, Aikins was promoted to the Ministry of Inland Revenue. In this capacity, he oversaw various applications for government postings; he had little direct control over patronage in central Canada, but was a more powerful figure as regards the western provinces.

Aikins&#x27;s support for temperance was an embarrassment for the Macdonald government, which received considerable financial support from liquor interests. On May 22, 1882, Aikins was persuaded to resign from cabinet and the Senate, and to accept an appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba (with the promise of being re-appointed to the Senate after his term ended). He formally resigned from the Senate on May 30, and was sworn into his new position on December 2.

Aikins arrived in Manitoba during a period of discord between the provincial and federal governments; Macdonald had recently disallowed Premier John Norquay&#x27;s railway legislation, and an opposition movement was forming around Thomas Greenway. Aikins was under orders from Macdonald to ensure that provincial legislation reflected national policies, but his awkward relationship with Norquay made his task difficult.

Aikins presided over the transfer of power from Norquay to Greenway in 1887-88, but his own involvement in Manitoba politics was fairly limited. Initially a very powerful office, the position of Lieutenant Governor in Manitoba was largely ceremonial by this time and more so under his predecessor Cauchon.

Aikins&#x27;s term in office ended on July 1, 1888, though he was not re-appointed to the Senate until January 7, 1896 again representing (Ontario). By now fully integrated into the Conservative ranks, he remained a Senator until his death in 1904. He is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto.

==Family==
James Cox Aikins married Mary Elizabeth Jane Somerset on June 5, 1845. She was the only daughter of John Somerset, Esquire, of Toronto. She was a founder and the first president of the Women&#x27;s Hospital Aid Society of Winnipeg, Manitoba. She was a founder of the Christian Woman&#x27;s Union of Winnipeg. The couple had three sons and two daughters. Mary Elizabeth Jane died May 25, 1899. One of the couple&#x27;s sons, also named James, served as Lt. Governor of Manitoba in the early 20th century.

<text>Zelinskiy is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies nestled along the northern edge of Mare Ingenii, with the oddly shaped crater Van de Graaff along the east rim and the lava-flooded crater Thomson within one crater diameter to the south.

This crater is somewhat elliptical, having an outwardly bulging rim to the east. Impacts have not significantly eroded many parts of the rim, although a small crater lies along the inner wall at the north end of the interior floor. The floor is relatively level in the south and west, with some irregularities in the surface to the northeast.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint closest to Zelinskiy.

Zelinskiy Y lies within Zelinskiy itself, along the northern margin.

<doc id="950718" wikidata="Q1018159" url="?curid=950718" title="Butterworth, Seberang Perai">
<text>Butterworth is the city centre of Seberang Perai in the Malaysian state of Penang. It lies about east of George Town, the capital city of Penang, across the Penang Strait. , Butterworth had a total population of 80,378 residents.

Butterworth was named after William John Butterworth, a former Governor of the Straits Settlements during the mid-19th century. Under the British Raj, the town came into being as a transportation hub, due to its proximity to George Town. While the British East India Company initially obtained Seberang Perai (then named &quot;Province Wellesley&quot;) for agricultural purposes, Butterworth has also witnessed massive industrialisation during the latter half of the 20th century. In 1974, the Port of Penang was relocated into the town.

A cross-strait ferry service provides a direct link between Butterworth and George Town. The Port of Penang handled 1.52 million TEUs of cargo , making it one of the busiest seaports in Malaysia. In addition, the Butterworth railway station, situated adjacent to the town&#x27;s ferry terminal, is a major Malayan Railway station, with train services operated by both the Malayan Railway and the State Railway of Thailand.

== Etymology ==
The town of Butterworth was named after William John Butterworth, who was the Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1843 to 1855.

==History==
A fishing village named Bagan had existed prior to the acquisition of the area by the British East India Company. The town of Butterworth only came into being in the British Raj and was concurrently named after the then Governor of the Straits Settlements, William John Butterworth.

Butterworth was developed as a mainland counterpart to the bustling entrepôt of George Town on Penang Island, directly across the Penang Strait. During the British Raj, Butterworth grew into a major transportation hub. Passengers and goods were transported across the strait by sampans, and in 1894, the first cross-strait ferry service between Butterworth and George Town was introduced. By 1900, a nascent railway line running the length of British Malaya was extended to Butterworth. These developments allowed tin to be transported more efficiently to Butterworth, which functioned as a transit point whereby the tin would then be shipped to George Town for smelting and export.

As with the rest of Penang, Butterworth was occupied by the Japanese between December 1941 and September 1945. During the early days of the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force units stationed at RAF Butterworth struggled to counter Japanese air raids over Penang and took heavy casualties. These Allied units had to withdraw southwards by 15 December, while RAF Butterworth was seized by the Imperial Japanese 25th Army on 20 December.

After Malaya&#x27;s independence in 1957, as part of an effort to advocate import substitution industries in the 1960s, the Alliance-led Penang state government, led by the then Chief Minister Wong Pow Nee, developed Mak Mandin as the first industrial estate in Penang. The Mak Mandin Industrial Estate was founded in 1961. In 1974, the Port of Penang was relocated from George Town to Butterworth, substantially boosting the town&#x27;s economy.

The Butterworth Town Council had been established in 1953. However, the town council was amalgamated with the Seberang Perai North Rural District Council in 1962. The local governments in Seberang Perai were eventually merged and upgraded into the Seberang Perai Municipal Council in 1976.

Towards the end of the 20th century, Butterworth underwent a period of decline. The town suffered significantly due to administrative decentralisation. The North Seberang Perai District Office, along with the district&#x27;s police headquarters and a government-run hospital, was moved out of the town. By the time of the relocation of the Seberang Perai Municipal Council from Butterworth to Bukit Mertajam in 2006, the town&#x27;s infrastructure had deteriorated extensively. In 1988, the passenger platform of the town&#x27;s ferry terminal collapsed, costing 32 lives, while in 2001, a fire destroyed a three-storey bus station near the ferry terminal.

In recent years, more efforts have been undertaken to revive the town&#x27;s fortunes. At present, the ongoing infrastructure projects within Butterworth include Penang Sentral, which is mooted as the main transportation hub within the State of Penang, and by extension, northern Malaysia. Plans to rejuvenate parts of the town centre through the promotion of arts and culture have also been implemented through public-private partnerships.

==Geography==
Butterworth lies at the southernmost tip of the North Seberang Perai District, between the Perai River to the south and the Penang Strait to the west. The Perai River forms a natural boundary between Butterworth and the neighbouring suburb of Perai, with the latter situated on the southern banks of the river. Both areas are connected via the Prai River Bridge, which spans the width of the Perai River. Butterworth spans an area of , and includes neighbourhoods such as Bagan Ajam, Bagan Dalam, Bagan Jermal and Bagan Luar.

== Demographics ==

, Butterworth was home to a population of 80,378, resulting in a population density of . Ethnic Chinese constituted more than half of the city centre&#x27;s population, while Malays formed another 24%. Indians also comprised over 14% of the population, followed by non-citizens at nearly 10%.

== Economy ==

The economy of Butterworth is primarily driven by its industries and the maritime trade at the Port of Penang. The Mak Mandin Industrial Estate forms the heart of Butterworth&#x27;s manufacturing sector and is home to a number of major local firms, including Federal Oats Mills, Fujikura Federal Cables and Zenman Industries. In addition, Butterworth has active steel and tin industries. The former includes steel fabrication, and smaller businesses dealing with automotive parts and scrap metal. The town&#x27;s tin industry players include Malaysia Smelting Corporation, the world&#x27;s second largest supplier of tin and a subsidiary of the Singapore-listed Straits Trading Company.

Meanwhile, the Port of Penang is the third busiest seaport in Malaysia, handling 1.52 million TEUs of container in 2017. The Port&#x27;s strategic location enabled it to service not just northern Malaysia, but also southern Thailand.

==Transportation==
Butterworth is the main transportation hub within the State of Penang, due to its location by the Penang Strait and its close proximity to George Town on Penang Island.

=== Sea ===
In 1974, the Port of Penang moved its cargo and container operations from George Town on Penang Island to Butterworth. Currently the most important harbour within northern Malaysia, the Port of Penang now operates four facilities within Butterworth. 
* North Butterworth Container Terminal
* Butterworth Wharves
* Vegetable oil tanker pier
* Bagan Dalam Dockyard

Penang Ferry is a shuttle ferry service that links Butterworth with George Town. The oldest ferry service in Malaysia commenced operations in 1894, and to this day, serves as a convenient mode of transportation across the Penang Strait for the residents of Butterworth. At present, six ferries ply the Penang Strait between the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal in Butterworth and George Town daily.

=== Land ===

The Butterworth railway station is one of the major stations along the Malayan Railway&#x27;s west coast route. As such, regular Malayan Railway services are available to other cities along western Peninsular Malaysia, including Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca and Johor Bahru, as well as on to Woodlands in northern Singapore. Aside from these, the Butterworth railway station is also the terminus of the State Railway of Thailand&#x27;s Southern Line (via Padang Besar) and the International Express from Bangkok. Notably, the train station is one of the main stops of the Eastern and Oriental Express service between Bangkok and Singapore as well.

In recent years, the Penang Sentral project has been underway at a site adjacent to both the Butterworth railway station and Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal. Mooted as the main transportation hub in the State of Penang and as Penang&#x27;s answer to Kuala Lumpur Sentral, Penang Sentral is intended to serve as a termini for both public bus and longer-distance intercity bus services.

Public bus services are provided by two firms - Rapid Penang and Cityliner. Due to Butterworth&#x27;s importance as a transportation hub, most of the Rapid Penang&#x27;s routes originate and terminate within the town. Rapid Penang&#x27;s bus routes 601, 602, 603, 604, 605, 608, 701, 702, 703, 709 and 801 connect Butterworth with other towns within Seberang Perai, including Perai, Bukit Mertajam, Kepala Batas and Nibong Tebal, whilst the company&#x27;s Intercity routes link Butterworth with Sungai Petani in Kedah and Parit Buntar in Perak. Cityliner operates another six bus routes which link Butterworth with a handful of destinations in Seberang Perai, Kedah and Perak.

Meanwhile, the Butterworth Outer Ring Road (BORR) was completed in 2005 in order to reduce traffic congestion along the North–South Expressway east of the town, as well as facilitating traffic dispersion within Butterworth itself. The BORR includes the Prai River Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge that links Butterworth and Perai to the south. Another major expressway within Butterworth is the Butterworth–Kulim Expressway, an interstate highway that connects Butterworth with Kulim in Kedah.

== Education ==
Butterworth contains a total of 20 primary schools, nine high schools, a government-run vocational college and three private tertiary institutions.

== Health care ==
Butterworth is served by one private hospital - the Bagan Specialist Centre. Established in 1988, the 150-bed hospital also contains nine operating theatres and offers, among others, orthopaedic and endocrinology treatments.

== Tourist attractions ==
The Tow Boo Kong Temple is a Taoist temple which is dedicated to the Taoist principal Deity, Doumu and the Nine Emperor Gods. Built in stages between the 1970s and 2009, the temple at Jalan Raja Uda now serves as a focal point for the grand celebration of Nine Emperor Gods Festival, which occurs annually on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month in the Chinese calendar.

The Sree Maha Mariamman Devasthanam Temple, at Bagan Luar, is the oldest Hindu temple in Butterworth. Founded in 1853, the temple is dedicated to the Hindu deity, Mariamman, a goddess of rain. Urban legend has it that the temple was built when a statue of Mariamman was found by the seaside.

As part of efforts to revive the fortunes of Butterworth, a number of alleys within the town centre have been decorated with wall murals, similar in style to the street art in George Town. In addition, the Butterworth Fringe Festival, inaugurated in 2015 as a spin-off to the George Town Festival, is an annual arts festival held within the town centre every August.

== Military ==

A Royal Malaysian Air Force airfield - RMAF Butterworth - is located to the north of Butterworth proper. Completed by the British in 1941 just prior to the Japanese invasion of Malaya, the airfield served both the Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force squadrons tasked with defending the airspace over Penang. However, the Japanese immediately gained air superiority, damaging the Butterworth airfield in the process. The station was then captured by the Imperial Japanese 25th Army on 20 December 1941.

During the post-war period, the Butterworth airfield was put to use by the Royal Air Force, and subsequently, the Royal Australian Air Force, to combat the communist threat in Malaya at the time. The Australian squadrons based in Butterworth also saw action during the Indonesian Confrontation in the 1960s.

In 1988, the Butterworth airfield was handed over to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. Now renamed as RMAF Butterworth, the airfield housed the headquarters of the Integrated Area Defence System that covers both Malaysia and Singapore under the Five Power Defence Arrangements.

<text>Zhukovskiy is a lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon. It forms a pair with Lebedinskiy, which is attached to the eastern rim. There are no other named craters of note in the immediate vicinity, although the immense walled plain Korolev lies farther to the southeast.

The rim of Zhukovskiy has become somewhat eroded, particularly at the northern and southern extremes. The interior floor is relatively level, although a small but prominent crater occupies part of the southern half.

Zhukovskiy is a crater of Nectarian age.

Zhukovskiy lies to the southwest of the Dirichlet–Jackson Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zhukovskiy.

<text>Zwicky is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the west of the crater Aitken, and is attached to the western rim of Vertregt. Attached to the northern end of Zwicky is Heaviside. Zwicky is a considerably eroded formation with an irregular rim and interior. Portions of the southern rim still survive, but the remainder has been almost completely eradicated.

The satellite crater Zwicky N, located in the midst of the interior of Zwicky, has a relatively dark floor by comparison with the surrounding terrain. This smaller crater has a polygonal outline with relatively smooth inner walls. The interior floor is a lower albedo material that has a fractured surface. It is thought that this is caused by the cooling of molten material, or possibly tectonic movement. This is referred to informally as a &quot;turtleback crater floor&quot;.

The crater was named in 1974 by the IAU after astronomer Fritz Zwicky (1898–1974), a professor at Caltech, Pasadena, and pioneer in the study of supernovae and of galaxy clusters. The minor planet 1803 Zwicky is also named in his honour.

Zwicky crater was known as &quot;Crater 306&quot; prior to naming.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zwicky. Zwicky N crater had the proposed name of &quot;Ibn Hayyan&quot;, but this was not approved by the IAU.

<text>Zernike is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon.

It lies to the northwest of the larger crater Anderson. Like many craters on the far side, this formation has been battered by impacts, and as a result it is worn and eroded, especially in the southern half. Several small craterlets overlie the rim, and lie within the rugged interior floor.

The crater is named after Frits Zernike, a Dutch physicist and winner of the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics.

The crater lies within the Freundlich-Sharonov Basin.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zernike.

<doc id="950725" wikidata="Q3504972" url="?curid=950725" title="Del Boy">
<text>Derek Edward Trotter, more commonly known as Del Boy, is a fictional character from the BBC sitcom &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and one of the main characters of its spinoff series, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. He was played by David Jason in the original series and was portrayed as a teenager by James Buckley in the prequel. Del Boy is often regarded as one of the greatest comedy characters in the history of British television, and is regarded as an iconic character in British culture. In a 2001 poll conducted by Channel 4 Del Boy was ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters.

Incorporating aspects of Cockney culture (though not an actual Cockney), Del Boy is known for his broken French phrases, which are usually completely out of context, and a variety of British and Cockney catchphrases, including: &quot;He who dares, wins!&quot;, &quot;This time next year we&#x27;ll be millionaires&quot;, &quot;Cushty!&quot;, &quot;Lovely Jubbly!&quot;, &quot;You know it makes sense&quot; (which he usually says to his customers after they have agreed on a deal), &quot;Shut up you tart&quot; and &quot;You plonker!&quot;, usually said to Rodney.

==Personality==
Del Boy is a happy-go-lucky, cheeky character. While not always successful, his general optimism and confidence often persuade people to believe in him. Despite his general positive demeanour, the episode &quot;Diamonds Are For Heather&quot; reveals that Del Boy has suffered from feelings of loneliness over his lack of a family beyond Grandad and Rodney on at least one occasion. In the episode Del mentions visiting a friend&#x27;s Christening party and seeing his friend&#x27;s family had come to join in the celebration, at which point Del felt so upset that he left early.

His favourite song is &quot;Old Shep&quot;, and his favourite band is the Who. He likes the superhero Batman. In &quot;The Long Legs of the Law&quot; he implies that he supports Chelsea. In &quot;A Slow Bus to Chingford&quot; Rodney tells his date Janice that Del &quot;used to be cultural advisor to the Chelsea Shed&quot;, a reference to the Shed End at Stamford Bridge where the most fanatical Chelsea fans would stand. In other episodes, a Crystal Palace F.C. scarf is seen hanging from the hallway. He cannot swim– the certificate in his possession is not his–  nor fly a hang glider.

From the sixth series on, he adopts some of the mannerisms of a stereotypical yuppie of the late 1980s, pretending to be much more wealthy than he really is, as he tries to associate with the upper classes despite being obviously underclass.

Del Boy is a compulsive liar, particularly to women, customers, policemen and even his family and doctors. He sometimes lies when it is against his best interests, such as when he claims to be a health freak while suffering from severe stomach pains, leading to his spending several days under observation in hospital rather than receiving an immediate diagnosis. 

It is revealed in &quot;Sickness and Wealth&quot; that he is frightened of doctors, which causes him to resist Albert and Rodney&#x27;s advice for him to see one, until a medium tricks him into believing his late mother wants him to visit the doctor about his stomach. His fear of doctors goes so far that in the same episode Rodney mentions to Cassandra that Del was once stabbed outside a nightclub by a former fiancée, and rather than seek medical attention he treated the stab wound himself with the help of a bottle of TCP.

In &quot;Fatal Extraction&quot;, it is revealed that Del is also frightened of dentists, avoiding visiting them whenever possible (his previous dentist died on the night of the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977) and only reluctantly visiting due to bad toothache.

Del presents himself as being able to speak some French, though few of his phrases make any sense in the context he uses them in (e.g. saying &quot;au revoir&quot; to mean &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;bonjour&quot; as goodbye). He also thinks he has knowledge in subjects like geography (believing Stockholm to be in Norway), history, art and other academic subjects (his lack of knowledge in history is shown well in &quot;To Hull and Back&quot; in which he calls Albert &quot;the finest little sailor this country has produced since Nelson lost the Armada&quot;). He believes the term &quot;yuppie&quot; to be a compliment, and unintentionally causes considerable offence when he calls a person a yuppie to their face.

Del Boy is not always honest when expressing his love for his family and others. This side of his nature is shown in numerous episodes, such as &quot;Diamonds Are for Heather&quot;, &quot;Strained Relations&quot;, &quot;Dates&quot;, &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot; and &quot;Little Problems&quot;. His care for his grandfather (&quot;Grandad&quot; – Lennard Pearce) is shown in &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, when Del is henpecked by his fiancée Pauline Harris, but only puts his foot down when Pauline recommends putting Grandad in an old folks home. Another example of this care is shown in &quot;May the Force be With You&quot;. Faced with the possibility of Del and Rodney going to prison for handling a stolen microwave, corrupt policeman Roy Slater makes a cryptic comment suggesting that an alone and vulnerable Grandad could fall victim to an attack by some hired thugs. Del, having previously refused to name the thief, makes a deal with Slater to guarantee their release, with immunity from prosecution for doing so. Once he is given immunity from prosecution, he names himself as the thief.

Del is later diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome caused by his diet of fast foods, cigars and alcohol.

Although engaged many times, he never marries. He has had many girlfriends, a fact that is the subject of numerous sarcastic comments by Rodney. He finally meets his partner Raquel Turner (whom he calls his &quot;significant other&quot;) in the 1988 special &quot;Dates&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family===

Derek Edward Trotter was born to Joan Hollins and Reg Trotter. He was named after his two grandfathers, Derek and Edward. 

Del&#x27;s mother Joan died on 12 March 1964, apparently after a long period of ill health. His neglectful father Reginald leaves three months later, on Del&#x27;s 16th birthday, taking most of their money and even Del&#x27;s birthday cake. This leaves the teenage Del as the family&#x27;s sole provider, looking after his grandfather and Rodney, his half-brother who was born around thirteen years after him (the age gap is stated as thirteen years in one episode, but Rodney&#x27;s year of birth is anywhere between 1958 and 1963 according to different episodes). He lives with Rodney, Cassandra, Raquel and their son Damien at flat 368 on the twelfth floor of the fictional Nelson Mandela House on the Nyerere Estate, Peckham, London. Before that, he lives in an old, detached house in 39 Orchard Street with his mother, father and grandfather. His grandfather was an &quot;out of work lamp-lighter waiting for gas to make a comeback.&quot; In the episode &quot;Sleepless in Peckham&quot; Del gives the implication that his father was also a physically abusive bully who used to beat women and children, including Joan and Del. Del&#x27;s father was friends with Freddie Robdal, who became better known as Freddie the Frog. It was Del&#x27;s father who also brought Freddie to his home one night, which led to an affair between him and Joan, and soon after, the birth of Rodney. When he was a youngster, Del was always told to call Freddie &quot;Uncle Fred&quot;. Then, years later, when Uncle Albert got drunk one night at a party, he told Del all about the affair. Sometime afterwards, Uncle Albert told Del that Trigger’s aunt Rene took all the photos of Del&#x27;s mum because each one had a picture of Freddie in it, and she knew that when Rodney grew older the similarities would start to show, so she burnt all the photos of Joan after her funeral.

===Relationship with other characters===
Del Boy has many friends during the series; Denzil, Trigger, Boycie, Marlene and Mike, to name but a few. His enemy is DCI Roy Slater. Del is courageous and, although not intellectual, he is quick-witted but inadvertently gets Rodney into trouble. In &quot;Wanted&quot;, when a mentally unstable woman accuses Rodney of attacking her, Del makes a joke of it and says that the police have named Rodney &quot;The Peckham Pouncer&quot;. He is selfish, but can be very thoughtful, such as when he tried to help Rodney get over his wife Cassandra&#x27;s miscarriage of their first baby. He never hesitates to remind people about how he brought Rodney up practically on his own after their mother died and father left, often using this fact to win arguments with Rodney. He is also shown to be quite duplicitous, once described by corrupt policeman and former school peer Roy Slater as &quot;A man who could talk himself out of a room with no doors&quot;. In &quot;May the Force Be With You&quot;, he was arrested by Slater for handling a stolen microwave, but gained his release by agreeing to name the thief provided he and his family were granted immunity from prosecution. Once Del&#x27;s immunity was guaranteed, he confessed that he was the thief, confidently showing a shocked Slater his immunity papers.

Del and Rodney often tease Uncle Albert about his appearance and resemblance to Captain Birdseye, although they show fonder feelings for him when he dies in &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;. Rodney apologises for the way he treats Albert in &quot;Sickness and Wealth&quot;.

In &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, Del Boy is shown to have a deeply close relationship with his mother Joan, whom he is very protective of. (He is Joan&#x27;s favourite, to the point that she refuses to run away with Freddie Robdal until she is certain of Del&#x27;s financial security.) His relationship with Grandad is the same in &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; as in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, but he has an estranged relationship with his father Reg. It is clear that they love each other, but they are sometimes at odds, particularly regarding Reg&#x27;s slacker lifestyle and when Reg verbally abuses Joan, when Del threatens to harm him if he does it again. Del is also visibly disgusted to hear that Joan is pregnant with what he incorrectly believes to be Reg&#x27;s second child. By the end of the pilot episode, their relationship begins to improve, although in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; it is clear that Del has still not forgiven Reg for abandoning the family after Joan&#x27;s death. This is demonstrated in &quot;Thicker than Water&quot; when he nearly ejects Reg from the flat. But Del still appears to feel some familial loyalty to Reg, shown when he gives him some money just before his departure.

==Career==
Del Boy works as a market trader, running his own company, Trotters Independent Traders (T.I.T.), either from out of a suitcase or from the back of his bright yellow Reliant Regal supervan. With a never-ending supply of get-rich-quick schemes and an inner belief in his ability to sell anything to anyone, he embroils &quot;the firm&quot;, as he calls the family business, in a variety of improbable situations. This unwavering confidence had given rise to his oft-proclaimed ambition &quot;This time next year, we&#x27;ll be millionaires!&quot; His business acumen is described in the episode &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;, when Del is depressed about his financial situation and Rodney says, &quot;The old Derek Trotter could smell a fiver in a force 9 gale. They used to say that if Del Boy fell into a Viper&#x27;s Pit, he&#x27;d come up wearing snake-skin shoes.&quot;

However, in the episode &quot;Cash and Curry&quot;, from series one, Del lost £2,000 to a pair of confidence tricksters.

While maintaining a tough exterior, Del still mourns the death of his mother and runs T.I.T. with Rodney. He takes great pride in having raised Rodney after their mother&#x27;s premature death and has never forgiven his father for running away when Rodney was an infant. Despite their often minimal income, Del insists on caring for his elderly grandfather. When Grandad dies, his role in the family trio is taken by his younger brother Albert, who receives the same level of respect (and light-hearted abuse).

Del Boy is a petty criminal and makes no attempt to hide it unless directly confronted by the authorities. On one occasion, he claims that at least half his possessions are illegal, including the furniture. He dabbles in theft, but mostly receives stolen goods and sells them on. He pays no tax, claiming that, since he and his family do not benefit from the welfare state, they should not have to contribute to it. In an early episode, &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, it is implied that he is legally dead and therefore does not pay tax.

Del and Rodney become millionaires, following the sale of a priceless watch, which they discover amongst their inventory. In the feature-length episode &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;, the Trotters&#x27; business is liquidated, Del Boy is declared bankrupt, and he receives a two-year suspended sentence for his years of tax evasion, with a condition that he pay off the outstanding balance within twelve months to avoid being sent to prison. Rodney becomes the managing director of a reformed T.I.T., but this does not stop Del acting as if he runs the business. He fails to make enough to pay his tax bill, but an inheritance from the recently deceased Uncle Albert gives him the money he needs.

Del Boy&#x27;s &quot;autobiography&quot;, called &quot;He Who Dares&quot;, was released in October 2015.
