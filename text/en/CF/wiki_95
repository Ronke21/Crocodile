He is best known for originating the lead role of the Baker in the original Broadway production of the musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; by Stephen Sondheim. He appeared in all of the &quot;Marvin Trilogy&quot; musicals by William Finn: as Marvin in &quot;In Trousers&quot;, and as Dr. Mendel in &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot;, &quot;Falsettoland&quot; and &quot;Falsettos&quot;. In 2023, he returned to Broadway to critical acclaim in the lead role of Rabbi Josef Roman Cycowski in Barry Manilow and Bruce Sussman’s &quot;Harmony&quot;. 

In 1989, he starred as Otto Kringelein in &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; and in 2007, he played Mssr. Thénardier in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, both on Broadway. He also created the role of Mr. Bungee in the original production of &quot;A New Brain&quot;. On the screen, he portrayed Mark Rothenberg in the film &quot;United 93&quot;. He is also known for providing the voice of the titular character in the film &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. In 2012, he returned to &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the Delacorte Theater portraying the Mysterious Man, the father of the Baker, the role Zien originated.

==Early life==
Zien was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and graduated from Whitefish Bay High School and later from the University of Pennsylvania. There, he was the chairman of the Mask and Wig Club, a historic collegiate musical comedy troupe.

==Career==
Young Zien started in local theatrical productions. One of his early roles was as a child in a production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; at the Melody Top summer outdoor theatre in Milwaukee.

===Stage===
Zien&#x27;s first major role was in 1977 at the Manhattan Theater Club in the musical &quot;The Redemption Center&quot; (by Ron Cowen, Seth Glassman, and Sandy Naishtat), opposite Alice Playten as the young couple. Later, Chip received acclaim in the role of Marvin in William Finn&#x27;s first musical, &quot;In Trousers&quot;, which ran Off-Broadway in 1979. In its sequels, &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot; (1981) and &quot;Falsettoland&quot;, this role was played by Michael Rupert, while Zien played Mendel, a role he reprised when these two one-act musicals were joined together and played Broadway as &quot;Falsettos&quot; in 1992. In 1998 Zien was featured in another Finn musical when he played a children&#x27;s show host called Mr. Bungee, dressed as a frog, in &quot;A New Brain&quot; Off-Broadway at the Lincoln Center Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. He received a 1999 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical for this role.

He appeared in the Off-Broadway play &quot;Isn&#x27;t It Romantic&quot; by Wendy Wasserstein in a Playwrights Horizons production at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, opening in June 1984. He was nominated for the 1984 Drama Desk Award, Featured Actor in a Play. He originated the role of the Baker in &quot;Into the Woods&quot; in 1986 at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego and on Broadway in 1987.

Zien starred on Broadway in &quot;Ride the Winds&quot; (as Inari) (1974), &quot;The Suicide&quot; (as Victor Victorovich) (1980), &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (as Otto Kringelein) (1989) and &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot; (as Dromio of Ephesus) (2002). He appeared in the City Center Encores! staged concert production of &quot;Applause&quot; as Buzz Richards in 2008.

In 2005, Zien played the part of Goran in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; on Broadway.

In 2007, Zien was a replacement in the Broadway revival of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the role of Monsieur Thénardier.

From April 1 to June 19, 2011, Zien appeared in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;The People in the Picture&quot;, which played at Studio 54 on Broadway.

Zien appeared in a revival of &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park from August 9 to September 1, 2012. He played the Mysterious Man, the father of the character he had originated in the original production 26 years prior.

Zien appeared in the Broadway musical &quot;It Shoulda Been You&quot; at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre as Murray with music by Barbara Anselmi, book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove. The show, marking the directorial debut of David Hyde Pierce, starred Tyne Daly, Harriet Harris, Sierra Boggess, and David Burtka, and opened in previews March 17, 2015, and officially on April 14.

Zien originated the role of Older Rabbi Josef Roman Cycowski of the famous Comedian Harmonists both Off-Broadway and on Broadway in the musical &quot;Harmony&quot; at both the Museum of Jewish Heritage at the National Theater Folksbiene (where he was nominated for a Drama Desk Award) and the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

===Film and television===
In 1973, Zien made his television debut on an episode of &quot;Love, American Style&quot;. More guest roles in television followed, and in the early 1980s, he began a stream of regular TV roles. In 1981, he appeared on &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; as Daniel Thorne, the producer of the fictional &quot;Proud and the Passionate&quot; soap opera on the series in which the character Barbara Wilde (Judith Barcroft) was starring. Later that year, he began a two-year run in the freshman NBC sitcom &quot;Love, Sidney&quot; as Jason Stoller, the young, hot-shot ad agency director who was Sidney Shorr&#x27;s (Tony Randall) boss. Immediately after &quot;Love, Sidney&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Zien was cast in a similar role on the ABC sitcom &quot;Reggie&quot;, an American adaptation of the British series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;. He played C.J. Wilcox, the overbearing young boss of Richard Mulligan&#x27;s Reggie Potter. The series aired as a summer replacement during August and September 1983, but was not renewed by ABC after the tryout run. In 1986, he provided the voice of the title character in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;. Zien later starred on the short-lived CBS drama &quot;Shell Game&quot; in 1987.

In the 1990s, Zien was part of the ensemble cast of the CBS sitcom &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; (1995–96), playing neurotic screenwriter Gary Karp. &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; was cancelled shortly into its second season, but the series sustained its loyal following via reruns on USA Network not long after. Zien would return to regular roles in daytime drama, first on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in early 1999, and by that summer, as newspaper reporter Donald Steele on &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role that would last until 2001.

From 1999 to 2000, Zien had a recurring guest role on the CBS primetime drama &quot;Now and Again&quot; as Gerald Misenbach. He has appeared repeatedly as Attorney Cromwell on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

During the 2002–03 season, Zien was the announcer on daytime&#x27;s &quot;The Caroline Rhea Show&quot;, which was based in New York (on the former &quot;Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; set). In 2006, he appeared in the critically acclaimed film &quot;United 93&quot; as Mark Rothenberg. He played Dr. Marsh in the vampire comedy film &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead&quot;.

==Personal life==
Zien is married to former dancer and dancing instructor Susan Pilarre; the couple has two children.

<doc id="970928" wikidata="Q381232" url="?curid=970928" title="Aero A.32">
<text>The Aero A.32 was a biplane built in Czechoslovakia in the late 1920s for army co-operation duties including reconnaissance and tactical bombing. While the design took the Aero A.11 as its starting point (and was originally designated A.11J), the aircraft incorporated significant changes to make it suited for its new low-level role.

Like the A.11 before it, the A.32 provided Aero with an export customer in the Finnish Air Force, which purchased 16 aircraft in 1929 as the A.32IF and A.32GR (which spent most of their service lives as trainers). They were assigned numbers AEj-49 – AEj-64 and were used until 1944. At least one aircraft has survived, AEj-59 is on the show of the Päijänne-Tavastia Aviation Museum.

A total of 116 of all variants were built.

==History &amp; Development==
The first prototype, &quot;A.11J&quot;, was flown in the summer of 1927. As the name suggests, it was the successor to the successful A.11 series of aircraft. Ab.11.17 was fitted with a licensed nine-cylinder IV. The factory offered it to Ministry of Defence (Czechoslovakia) in April 1928 under the designation &quot;A.32&quot; as an escort fighter. The prototype A.32.1 was flown in October 1928 and the Air Force took it over in December. Meanwhile, it took part in demonstrations in Bulgaria and was subsequently also offered to the Turkish Air Force. The second prototype, A.32.2, was equipped with an W Škoda L engine. The third prototype, A.32.3, was tested with another Walter Jupiter radial engine.

At the beginning of 1929 Aero offered the A.32 to Finland. After a successful demonstration, representatives of the Finnish Air Force brokered a contract for the delivery of 16 aircraft: one A.32IF with a Isotta Fraschini Asso Caccia in-line engine and 15 A.32GR with a Gnome-Rhône 9 Jupiter radial engine. 8 aircraft were delivered in June 1929, and the rest later in 1929. 15 aircraft (designation AEj-49 to AEj-64) were delivered between August and October 1929 and one in 1930, with one serving until 30 June 1944.

On July 11, 1929, the Ministry of Defense ordered the production of six AP-32s with the Walter Jupiter IV engine (AP.32.4–AP.32.9) at the Aero factory, and on December 19, 1929, an order was placed for another 25 aircraft (AP.32.10–AP.32.34). Following the prototype tests and in cooperation with , Aero offered an improved version, of which 45 units (AP.32.35–AP.32.79) were produced in the years 1930–1931 based on orders from August 1930 and January 1931. All of the original models were modified to an improved version at the request of the Air Force. This consisted of strengthening the fuselage, reconstruction of the landing gear, installation of brakes and new bomb hangers. In 1930, a formation of these combat and reconnaissance aircraft, led by the commander of the Czechoslovak Air Force, General Eng. Jaroslav Fajfr, successfully participated in the national aviation meeting in Bucharest.

The installation of a more powerful Walter Jupiter VI engine resulted in the APb.32 version, of which 35 units were produced until 1932 in two series (APb.32.80–APb.32.99 and APb.32.100–APb.32.114).

The AP.32/APb.32 served until the mid-1930s, when they were replaced by Letov Š.328s. By 1938 they were used only as training and second line machines. Four AP.32s loaned by the army (production numbers 7, 19, 20 and 42), along with Škoda D.1 were loaned for use by Chetnik air patrols in July 1935.

During service with the Czechoslovak Air Force, 43 AP.32/APb.32 were written off due to crashed, in which 11 pilots and nine observers died. After the dissolution of the Czechoslovakia, five AP.32 and one APb.32 were inherited by the 3rd Aviation Regiment (replacement and 12th squadrons) in the Slovak Air Force. The others fell into the hands of the Luftwaffe, which continued to use them for a year with its training units.

Four A.32s were used by the police from 1935-1939 with the designations OK-PAD, OK-PAE, OK-PAF, &amp; OK-PAI.

==Technical Description==
The AP.32 and APb.32 were two-seater single-engine strut biplanes with fixed aft landing gear and open crew compartments. The metal frame of the fuselage was covered with aluminium sheets in the front part, the rest of the fuselage and the wooden frame of the wings were covered with canvas. The struts between the wings were made of steel tubes and covered with aerodynamic wood trim. A drop gasoline tank was placed in the canopy.

The AP.32 was powered by the Walter Jupiter IV air-cooled radial nine-cylinder at first, then later by the APb.32 Walter Jupiter VI, with a two-blade non-adjustable wooden propeller. The armament consisted of two synchronized 7.92 mm vz.28 air cooled machine guns in the hull, with the observer operating a twin mount vz. 28. The total supply of ammunition was 1100 rounds. Bombs up to a total weight of 120 kg for the AP.32 and 250 kg for the APb.32 could be hung under the lower wing.

==Existing Examples==
The Aero AP-32 airplane is on display in the Kbely aviation museum. This aircraft is a partial replica. It was manufactured at Letecké opravny Trenčín in 1990 based on the original technical and production documentation. It is equipped with the camouflage of Aviation Regiment No. 1 of the Czechoslovak Air Force, which was based at Prague-Kbely Airport.

An incomplete Aero A-32GR (without engine) is on display at the Finnish Aviation Museum in Päijät-Häme.

<doc id="970932" wikidata="Q4751008" url="?curid=970932" title="Anal masturbation">
<text>Anal masturbation is an autoerotic practice in which a person masturbates by sexually stimulating their own anus and rectum. Common methods of anal masturbation include manual stimulation of the anal opening and the insertion of an object or objects. Items inserted may be sex toys such as anal beads, butt plugs, dildos, vibrators, rectal thermometers or specially designed prostate massagers or enemas.

==Method==
Pleasure can be derived from anal masturbation due to the nerve endings in the anal and rectal areas.

===Men===

In men, orgasmic function through genitalia depends in part on the healthy functioning of the smooth muscles surrounding the prostate, and of the pelvic floor muscles. Anal masturbation can be especially pleasurable for those with a functioning prostate because it often stimulates the area, which also contains sensitive nerve endings. Some men find the quality of their orgasm to be significantly enhanced by the use of a butt plug or other anally inserted item during sexual activity. It is typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex.

===Women===

Some women also engage in anal masturbation. Alfred Kinsey in &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; documented that &quot;There still [are] other masturbatory techniques which were regularly or occasionally employed by some 11 percent of the females in the sample ... enemas, and other anal insertions, ... were employed.&quot;

===Other methods===
Enemas can be used as a form of anal masturbation, as noted above by Kinsey, sexual arousal by enemas being known as klismaphilia, but also, enemas or anal douches can, for hygienic reasons, be taken prior to anal masturbation if desired.

===Autosodomy===
Autosodomy is the penetration of one&#x27;s own anus with their own penis. This is possible if the penis is long enough and the genitals are properly maneuvered.

==Safety==
Insertion of foreign objects into the anus is not without dangers. Unsafe anal masturbation methods cause harm and a potential trip to the hospital emergency room. However, anal masturbation can be carried out in greater safety by ensuring that the bowel is emptied before beginning, the anus and rectum are sufficiently lubricated and relaxed throughout, and the inserted object is not of too great a size.

===Objects===

Some anal stimulators are purposely ribbed or have a wave pattern in order to enhance pleasure and simulate intercourse. Stimulating the rectum with a rough-edged object or a finger (for the purposes of medically stimulating a bowel movement or other reasons) may lead to rectum wall tearing, especially if the fingernail is left untrimmed. Vegetables have rough edges and may have microorganisms on the surface, and thus could lead to infection if not sanitized before use.

===Risks associated with bleeding===
Minor injuries that cause some bleeding to the rectum pose measurable risk and often need treatment. Injury can be contained by cessation of anal stimulation at any sign of injury, bleeding, or pain. While minor bleeding may stop of its own accord, individuals with serious injury, clotting problems, or other medical factors could face serious risk and require medical attention.

Prolonged or heavy bleeding can indicate a life-threatening situation, as the intestinal wall can be damaged, leading to internal injury of the peritoneal cavity and peritonitis, which can be fatal. Carefully using implements without sharp edges or rough surfaces carries a lower risk of damage to the intestinal wall.

The treatment for persistent or heavy bleeding will require a visit to an emergency room for a sigmoidoscopy and cauterization in order to prevent further loss of blood. Apart from the volume of blood that is lost into the rectum, other easily observable indications that medical intervention is urgently needed as a result of blood loss are an elevated heart rate, a general feeling of faintness or weakness, and a loss of pleasure from the act.

===Rectal foreign bodies===

Butt plugs normally have a flared base to prevent complete insertion and should be carefully sanitized before and after use. Sex toys, including objects for rectal insertion, should not be shared in order to minimize the risk of disease. Objects such as lightbulbs or anything breakable such as glass or wax candles cannot safely be used in anal masturbation, as they may break or shatter, causing highly dangerous medical situations.

Some objects can become lodged above the lower colon and could be seriously difficult to remove. Such foreign bodies should not be allowed to remain in place. Medical help should be sought if the object does not emerge on its own. Immediate assistance is recommended if the object is not a proper rectal toy (like a plug or something soft, for example), if it is either too hard, too large, has projections, or slightly sharp edges, or if any trace of injury happens (bleeding, pain, cramps). Small objects with dimensions similar to small stools are less likely to become lodged than medium-sized or large objects as they can usually be expelled by forcing a bowel movement. It is always safest if a graspable part of the object remains outside the body.

==Hygiene==
The biological function of the anus is to expel intestinal gas and feces from the body; therefore, when engaging in anal masturbation, hygiene is important. One may wish to cover butt plugs or other objects with a condom before insertion and then dispose of the condom afterward. To minimize the potential transfer of germs between sexual partners, there are practices of safe sex recommended by healthcare professionals. Oral or vaginal infection may occur similarly to penile anus-to-mouth or anilingus practices.

<doc id="970935" wikidata="Q1023712" url="?curid=970935" title="San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago">
<text>San Fernando, officially the City of San Fernando, is the most populous city and second most populous municipality in Trinidad and Tobago, after Chaguanas. Sando, as it is known to many local Trinidadians, occupies 19 km2 and is located in the southwestern part of the island of Trinidad. It is bounded to the north by the Guaracara River, the south by the Oropouche River, the east by the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway, and the west by the Gulf of Paria. The former borough was elevated to the status of a city corporation on 18 November 1988. The motto of San Fernando is: &quot;Sanitas Fortis&quot; - &quot;In a Healthy Environment We Will Find Strength&quot;. San Fernando is called Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s &quot;industrial capital&quot; because of its proximity to the Pointe-à-Pierre oil refinery and many other petrochemical, LNG, iron and steel and aluminium smelters in places such as Point Lisas in Couva, Point Fortin, and La Brea.

==Geography Of Trinidad and Tobago==

San Fernando is a coastal city. It is bounded by the Guaracara River to the north, the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway to the east, the Southern Main Road to the southeast, and the Oropouche River to the south. The city proper is located on the flanks of two hills – San Fernando Hill (formerly known as Naparima Hill) and Alexander Hill. Several mansions on the pinnacle of Alexander Hill house belong to some of the more prominent San Fernandian families. The Cipero, Vistabella, Marabella and Godineau Rivers all enter the sea within the city limits.

=== Cityscape ===
San Fernando, unlike Port of Spain, does not have many skyscrapers. The tallest building in the city is the 18-story San Fernando Teaching Hospital, an extension of the San Fernando General Hospital. Some notable areas within San Fernando are:

* Downtown is the commercial centre of the city. Independence Avenue, commonly known by the pre-independence name of Broadway, runs through this area of the city. High Street is the centre of most commercial activity in the city, running from Chancery Lane/Independence Avenue to Pointe a Pierre Road. This area is also home to King&#x27;s Wharf and the San Fernando Waterfront, currently the subject of a major redevelopment project. The Water Taxi and Bus Terminals are located on the Waterfront. Many of the cities schools and medical centres are located in this area. 
* Pleasantville is a suburban area to the east of the city, flanked by the San Fernando Bypass and the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway respectively.
* Vistabella, Sumadh Gardens and St. Joseph are residential areas immediately to the north of the city, surrounding San Fernando Hill. 
* Marabella is a town often considered part of the Greater San Fernando area. It is a major commercial centre and is especially notable for its proximity to the former Petrotrin oil refinery. It is often considered the northern limit of the city.
* Cocoyea and Mon Repos are located to the east of the city, along the San Fernando Bypass.

Some of the major roadways within the city include the San Fernando Bypass, Lady Hailes Avenue, Independence Avenue, Pointe a Pierre Road, Cipero Street, Coffee Street, Rushworth Street, Royal Road, Navet Road and the Southern Main Road. 

San Fernando is especially notable for the Southern Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA), Skinner Park, Mannie Ramjohn Stadium, King&#x27;s Wharf and the San Fernando General Hospital. It is also notable for its commercial centres and malls: South Park, C3 Centre, Carlton Centre, Gopaul Lands, and numerous smaller shopping centres and areas centered around High Street and Cipero Street.

San Fernando is sometimes said to be the Southern capital of the country, and supportive of this name is the major role the city plays as the centre of many activities for people in South Trinidad; many people go to school and work in the city every day. 

===Climate===
San Fernando has a tropical rainforest climate, bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. Although the city does not technically qualify as having a true dry season, there is a noticeably drier stretch from February to April. 

==Demographics==
===Ancestry===

== Infrastructure ==

=== Health ===
The San Fernando General Hospital is located on Independence Avenue, close to the city center. It is considered the main trauma unit for the southern part of the island, and is administered by the Southwest Regional Health Authority (SWRHA).

There are numerous health centres in towns and villages around San Fernando that are considered to be part of the urban area. There are also a number of private medical institutions, such as:

* Southern Medical Clinic
* Surgi-Med Clinic
* Gulf View Medical Center

The San Fernando Teaching Hospital is connected to the San Fernando General Hospital by a skybridge, and is the main teaching hospital.

=== Transport ===

==== Road ====
San Fernando is dominated by private car commuting and has a very dense network of roadways. There are numerous points of entry into the city.

* The Rienzi Kirton Highway runs from Cipero Street to Ruth Avenue, where it becomes Independence Avenue. 
* The San Fernando Bypass runs along the outskirts of the city, providing access to many of the suburban areas. 
* The Golconda Connector Road connects the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway to Cipero Street &amp; the San Fernando Bypass. The Tarouba Link Road also connects the Sir Solomon Hochoy Highway to the San Fernando Bypass at the northern end of the city.
* Alternatively, traffic can exit at Corinth and enter the city via the Naparima Mayaro Road and Royal Road, or via Pleasantville. 
* Lady Hailes Avenue runs from Cipero Street to Kings Wharf along the city&#x27;s waterfront, connecting to the Reinzi Kirton Highway/Independence Avenue at only three points. It serves as a quicker point of entry to the city center as it terminates just outside the city center. There are plans to widen Lady Hailes Avenue into a four-lane dual carriageway, much of which has already been completed, as part of the waterfront revitalization project.

The city is often plagued by heavy traffic delays.

==== Public Transport ====
The San Fernando Bus Terminal is located to the North of Kings Wharf. There are numerous taxi stands around High Street. The water taxi service links San Fernando to Port of Spain via sea in approximately 1 hour.

==== Air ====
Like the rest of the island, the city is served by Piarco International Airport, approximately 37 km away from the city center.

<text>Matchstick models are scale models made from matches as a hobby. Regular matches are not used, however, but a special modeling type which do not have the combustible heads, and can be bought from art and craft shops. Though before the serial production of these, actual matches were used with heads trimmed off, or kept on to add coloured detail.

==History==
Originally, matchstick models were a pastime of prisoners (especially naval prisoners of war) during the 18th century. At the time, better funded modelers preferred to use more replicated parts for their models, like professionals today, and the poor couldn&#x27;t afford to use up so many matches. 

An early pioneer in matchstick models as an art form was Australian artist Len Hughes, whose first large-scale piece was a recreation of the Battle of the Spanish Armada that included 331 replica ships. Hughes went on to open the World of Matchcraft Museum in Caloundra, Queensland, which later closed. 

==Construction==
The matches are cut by means of a sharp knife and fixed together using glue, often being held in place by paperboard &quot;formers&quot; until the glue is dry. While the smallest gaps can be filled with glue, larger ones can be filled with specially carved matches. A number of hobbyists prefer to build their models from scratch. Many kits are available, consisting of instructions, pre-cut card formers and sufficient modeling matches for the project. 

An exceptionally large and impressive matchstick model was a scratch-built replica of Notre Dame Cathedral which included electric lights and measured over six feet in length.

== Exhibitions ==
Gladbrook, Iowa is home to the Matchstick Marvels Museum that includes numerous models by matchstick model artist Patrick Acton. His work includes a 13-foot scale model of the &quot;USS Iowa.&quot;

<doc id="970950" wikidata="Q662626" url="?curid=970950" title="Global aphasia">
<text>Global aphasia is a severe form of nonfluent aphasia, caused by damage to the left side of the brain, that affects receptive and expressive language skills (needed for both written and oral language) as well as auditory and visual comprehension. Acquired impairments of communicative abilities are present across all language modalities, impacting language production, comprehension, and repetition. Patients with global aphasia may be able to verbalize a few short utterances and use non-word neologisms, but their overall production ability is limited. Their ability to repeat words, utterances, or phrases is also affected. Due to the preservation of the right hemisphere, an individual with global aphasia may still be able to express themselves through facial expressions, gestures, and intonation. This type of aphasia often results from a large lesion of the left perisylvian cortex. The lesion is caused by an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and is associated with damage to Broca&#x27;s area, Wernicke&#x27;s area, and insular regions which are associated with aspects of language.

==Signs and symptoms==
It is most common for the onset of global aphasia to occur after a thrombotic stroke (at the trunk of the middle cerebral artery), with varying severity. The general signs and symptoms include the inability to understand, create, and repeat speech and language. These difficulties also persist in reading, writing, and auditory comprehension abilities.
Verbal language typically consists of a few recognizable utterances and words (e.g., hello), overlearned phrases (e.g., how are you), and expletives (e.g., a curse word). However, those affected by global aphasia may express themselves using facial expressions, intonation, and gestures. Extensive lexical (vocabulary) impairment is possible, resulting in an inability to read simple words or sentences. Global aphasia may be accompanied by weakness of the right side of the face and right hemiplegia (paralysis), but can occur with or without hemiparesis (weakness). Additionally, it is common for an individual with global aphasia to have one or more of the following additional impairments: apraxia of speech, alexia, pure word deafness, agraphia, facial apraxia, and depression.

Persons with global aphasia are socially appropriate, usually attentive, and task-oriented. Some are able to respond to yes/no questions, but responses are more reliable when questions refer to family and personal experiences. Automatic speech is preserved with normal phonemic, phonetic and inflectional structures. Right hemiparesis or hemiplegia, right-sided sensory loss, and right homonymous hemianopsia may manifest as well. Persons with global aphasia may recognize location names and common objects’ names (single-words), while rejecting pseudo-words and real but incorrect names.

==Causes==

Global aphasia typically results from an occlusion to the trunk of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which affects a large portion of the perisylvian region of the left cortex. Global aphasia is usually a result of a thrombotic stroke, which occurs when a blood clot forms in the brain&#x27;s blood vessels. In addition to stroke, global aphasia can also be caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI), tumors, and progressive neurological disorders. The large areas in the anterior (Broca&#x27;s) and posterior (Wernicke&#x27;s) area of the brain are either destroyed or impaired because they are separate branches of the MCA that are supplied by its arterial trunk. Lesions usually result in extensive damage to the language areas of the left hemisphere, however global aphasia can result from damage to smaller, subcortical regions. It is well known that a lesion to the cortex can cause aphasia. However, a study by Kumar et al. (1996) suggests that lesions to the subcortical regions of the cortex such as the thalamus, basal ganglia, internal capsule, and paraventricular white matter can also cause speech and language deficits. This is due to the fact that the subcortical regions are closely associated with the language centers in the brain. Kumar et al. state that while lesions to the subcortical regions could cause certain types of aphasia, a lesion to these regions would rarely cause global aphasia. In a study performed by Ferro (1992), it was found that five different brain lesion locations were linked to aphasia. These locations include: &quot;fronto-temporo-parietal lesions&quot;, &quot;anterior, suprasylvian, frontal lesions&quot;, &quot;large subcortical infarcts&quot;, &quot;posterior, suprasylvian, parietal infarcts&quot;, and &quot;a double lesion composed of a frontal and a temporal infarct&quot;.
==Diagnosis==
If a suspected brain injury has occurred, the patient undergoes a series of medical imaging, which could include MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scan. After the diagnosis of a brain injury, a speech and language pathologist will perform a variety of tests to determine the classification of aphasia. Additionally, the Boston Assessment of Severe Aphasia (BASA) is a commonly used assessment for diagnosing aphasia. BASA is used to determine treatment plans after strokes lead to symptoms of aphasia and tests both gestural and verbal responses. Cognitive functions can be assessed using the Cognitive Test Battery for Global Aphasia (CoBaGa). The CoBaGa is an appropriate measure to assess a person with severe aphasia because it does not require verbal responses, rather manipulative answers. The CoBaGa assesses cognitive functions such as attention, executive functions, logical reasoning, memory, visual-auditory recognition, and visual-spatial ability. Van Mourik et al. conducted a study in which they assessed the cognitive abilities of people with global aphasia using the Global Aphasic Neuropsychological Battery. This test assesses attention/concentration, memory, intelligence, and visual and auditory nonverbal recognition. The results of this study helped the researchers determine there were varying levels of severity among individuals with global aphasia.

==Treatment==

Speech and language therapy is typically the primary treatment for individuals with aphasia. The goal of speech and language therapy is to increase the person’s communication abilities to a level functional for daily life. Goals are chosen based on collaboration between speech language pathologists, patients, and their family/caregivers. Goals should be individualized based on the person’s aphasia symptoms and communicative needs. In 2016, Wallace et al. found the following outcomes were commonly prioritized in therapy: communication, life participation, physical and emotional well-being, normalcy, and health and support services. However, available research is inconclusive about which specific approach to speech and language therapy is most effective in treating global aphasia.

Therapy can be either group or individual. Group therapies that integrate the use of visual aids allow for enhanced social and communication-skill development. Group therapy sessions typically revolve around simple, preplanned activities or games, and aim to facilitate social communication.

One particular therapy designed specifically for treatment of aphasia is Visual Action Therapy (VAT). VAT is a non-verbal gestural output program with 3 phases and 30 total steps. The program teaches unilateral gestures as symbolic representations of real life objects. Research on the effectiveness of VAT is limited and inconclusive.

One important therapy technique includes teaching family members and caregivers strategies for more effectively communicating with their loved ones. Research offers such strategies including, simplifying sentences and using common words, gaining the person&#x27;s attention before speaking, using pointing and visual cues, allowing for adequate response time, and creating a quiet environment free of distractions.

Research supporting the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for aphasia is limited. To date, no large scale clinical trials have proven benefits of pharmacological treatment.
==Prognosis==

When evaluating the prognosis of a patient, the main contributing participant factors that influence the extent of neuroplasticity, or the brain&#x27;s ability to change are: age, lesion location, pre-existing cognitive status, motivation, overall health, and interaction amongst these. After brain damage, initial signs of global aphasia may appear within the first two days due to brain swelling (cerebral edema). With some time and natural recovery, impairment presentation may progress into expressive aphasia (most commonly) or receptive aphasia. Due to the size and location of the lesion associated with global aphasia, the prognosis for language abilities is poor. Research has shown that the prognosis of long-term language abilities is determined by the initial severity level of aphasia within the first four weeks after a stroke. As a result, there is a poor prognosis for persons who retain a diagnosis of aphasia after one month due to limited initial language abilities. Nonetheless, in the first year post-stroke, patients with global aphasia showed improvement in their Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) scores from baseline. When compared to individuals with Broca’s, Wernicke’s, anomic, and conduction types of aphasia, those with Broca’s aphasia showed the best rate and extent of improvement followed by global aphasia. The rate of improvement in language function was highest in the first four weeks after stroke.

Although the prognosis for persons diagnosed with global aphasia is poor, improvement in varying aspects of language is possible. For example, in 1992, Ferro performed research in which he studied the recovery of individuals with acute global aphasia, resulting from the five different lesion sites. The first lesion site was in the fronto-tempo-parietal region of the brain; patients with lesions in this location saw the least amount of gains out of all of the participants in the study, and they often never recovered from global aphasia. However, the second lesion site was the anterior, suprasylvian, frontal part of the brain; the third lesion site was the subcortical infarcts; and the fourth lesion site was the posterior, suprasylvian, parietal infarcts. Participants with lesions two, three, and four often recovered to a less severe form of aphasia, such as Broca&#x27;s or transcortical. The fifth lesion site was a double lesion in both the frontal and temporal infarcts; patients with lesions at this site showed slight improvement. However, studies show that spontaneous improvement, if it happens, occurs within six months, but complete recovery is rare.

Studies have shown that persons with global aphasia have improved their verbal and nonverbal speech and language skills through speech and language therapy. One study examined the recovery of a group of individuals who were classified as having global aphasia at 3 months poststroke. The individuals received intensive speech and language intervention. The results of the study illustrated that all of the patients showed improvement. The greatest area of improvement was in auditory comprehension, and the least in the use of propositional speech. After 6 months poststroke, the individuals showed an increased use of gestures to communicate, as their communication skills remained severely impaired.

During therapy, most progress is seen within the first 3 years, but it is possible for language abilities to continuously improve at a steady rate due to long-term intensive language intervention. While improvement in language abilities is possible with intervention, only 20 percent of persons diagnosed with global aphasia achieve functional use of language. Communication of basic needs and the comprehension of simple conversations on highly familiar topics, are examples of common functional language use for this population.

<text>Tarragindi () is a southern suburb of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is represented through the Holland Park and Moorooka Ward councillors on the Brisbane City Council. 
In the , Tarragindi had a population of 11,035 people.

== Geography ==

The suburb boundaries are largely defined by the Southeast Freeway and Toohey Forest. Ekibin Road (East) and streets skirting the Tarragindi Reservoir form the western boundary. Prior Street and Mayfield Road mark the start of the southern limits of the suburb.

The main part of the suburb lies in a valley running north–south, surrounded by ridges marked by Wellers Hill (the highest point) to the east and Tarragindi Hill to the west. Sandy Creek has it source in Toohey Forest to the south and flows through the major part of the suburb. The eastern flank of the Wellers Hill ridge drains into Ekibin Creek.

== History ==

=== Origin of the name ===

The suburb was named after a native from the Loyalty Islands (near modern-day New Caledonia) who was transported in the late nineteenth century to Queensland. Such people, called Kanakas, were a cheap source of labour for sugarcane production. Apparently Tarragindi Tasserone escaped and was subsequently employed by Alfred Foote of Ipswich. Later, he cleared land for William Grimes (related to Alfred Foote) on a hill near Sandy Creek and the property was named after him. Tarragindi remained with the Foote family in Ipswich until just before he died on 13 January 1913, aged 63. He worked for the Foote family for over 25 years. The grave of Tarra Gindi Tasserone is located in the Ipswich General Cemetery.

=== Indigenous history ===
Prior to European occupation beginning in the early 19th century the area covered by the suburb was inhabited by Aboriginal people. The Coorparoo sub-group of the wider Jagera group occupied land south of the Brisbane River clustered around Oxley, Norman and Bulimba creeks. It is also possible that the Yerongpan sub-group lived in the area. The Coorparoo group had cultural links to other neighbouring communities including territorially-neutral pathways, river crossings and ceremonies. A bora ring was known to have been maintained in Tarragindi, possibly between present-day Barnehurst and Isabella Streets. One trace of this early occupation persists in the locality and creek name, &quot;Ekibin&quot;. According to Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines (2003) the modern name is derived from the aboriginal &quot;Yekkabin&quot; which referred to aquatic plants (probably &quot;Telmatoblechnum indicum&quot;) with edible roots which grew in the creek. The edible roots were common in the diet of Aboriginals of the Moreton Bay area; a sharp stick was used to dig out the stem, which was then dried, roasted, and pounded with a stone.

=== European settlement ===
European settlement began 1857 with a survey of land by George Pratten. An early land-owner (and later Mayor of Brisbane and member of parliament), Thomas Stephens, established a woolscour and later a fellmongery in the northern part of the suburb near Essie Avenue. Another land-holder was James Toohey who leased properties for cattle runs.

=== Land sales ===
In October 1914 &quot;Cracknell Hill Estate&quot;, made up of 115 allotments of 16 perches, was advertised for sale by Isles Love &amp; Co., Auctioneers. The map advertising the sale states that the estate was a five minute walk from the proposed new tram terminus at Chardon&#x27;s Hotel. 

On 17 April 1920, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 97 allotments (mostly 16 perches) in the &quot;Cracknell Hill Estate&quot; which were in Queen Street (now Cavan Street), Hamlet Terrace (now Hamlet Street) and Woodville Place between Warwick Street (now Marjorie Street) and Percy Street. These appear to be unsold allotments of an estate first offered in October 1914.

In August 1924 Marcus F. Lyons &amp; Winning advertised 312 allotments for private sale in the &quot;Cracknel Road Estate&quot;, being subdivisions 1 to 313 of resubdivision 1 and 2 of portion 113, Parish of Yeerongpilly. A map advertising the sale states the estate is 5 minutes from Ipswich Road Trams, water main and electricity passes through the estate; and gas is handy to the estate.

=== World War II ===

During the Second World War, Tarragindi was the site of a field hospital administered first by the American Army (for soldiers treated for shell shock) and later by the British and Australian forces. The Ekibin Hospital was bounded by Sexton Street and Toohey Road and encompassed parts of Cracknell, Effingham, Fingal and Lutzow streets. After the war, the site was used by the Housing Commission to accommodate displaced persons. Today, little remains of the establishment except for possible foundations of a gun emplacement in the midsection of Fingal Street. The Ekibin Memorial Park on Cracknell Road commemorates the establishment of the hospital.

=== After World War II ===
St Barnabas&#x27; Anglican Church was dedicated on 2 August 1959 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. It closed in April 1989.

The school has a very active music program which is renowned within the area and has flourished under the care of several dedicated musical instructors. The motto of this school is &#x27;Strive to Succeed&#x27; and this motto is upheld visibly in the conduct of student and teacher. Its sports houses, named after Australian native animals, are Platypus (yellow), Emu (blue), Kangaroo (red), and Koala (green). In December 2006 and June 2013 the school lost some buildings due to arson attacks. The school introduced a Japanese Bilingual in program in 2014 and offers a student exchange program with its sister school from Yasugi in Japan.

St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is located at 55 Effingham Street on the corner of Cracknell Road and is part of the Annerley Ekibin Parish Mary Immaculate Church, Annerley. The school has 3 sporting houses, all named after people involved in the school&#x27;s development and significant people in the Christian faith: Bergin (gold) named after Fr Basil Bergin the first parish priest when the school opened, Elliot (red) which is named after Fr Graham Elliott who was a parish priest at St Elizabeth&#x27;s from 1976–1999 and Nagle (blue) which is named after Nano Nagle. The school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Caritas Christi&quot;, which is displayed on the boys&#x27; uniform and on the balcony of the Christi Centre where the students participate in art &amp; music. There is an OSHC Centre downstairs. The school has a chapel, which used to be a church until the installation of the Prep Rooms.

<text>The Hyakumangoku Matsuri (百万石まつり) is the main annual festival taking place in Kanazawa, Japan. The festival commemorates the entry of Lord Maeda Toshiie into Kanazawa Castle in 1583. The highlight of the festival is the Hyakumangoku Parade, which has begun on the first Saturday in June since 2007.

The Hyakumangoku Parade reenacts the entrance of Lord Maeda Toshiie and his entourage into Kanazawa. The participants are dressed in 16th-century period costumes and parade around several city blocks.

The name &quot;Hyakumangoku&quot; refers to rice production. &quot;Hyakuman&quot; means &quot;1,000,000&quot; (literally &quot;100 10,000&quot;) and the &quot;koku&quot; is a measurement of rice production. 1,000,000 koku is around 150,000 tonnes or 5,000,000 bushels of rice.

In the evening after the main parade there are Bon Festival dances starting from 19.00 h and ending late in the night. Employees from different companies wear different kimono, but anyone can join the dances. The traditional Japanese dance along the central street near Kohrinbo is a picturesque event, and the column of dancing people is several kilometers long.

&quot;Tourou nagashi&quot; (灯篭流し) commences the night before the main festival. Lit &quot;Kaga Yuzen&quot; lanterns are floated down the river Asano at dusk, starting near the &quot;Tenjin-Bashi&quot; bridge. The lanterns then float under the &quot;Ume-no-Hashi&quot; bridge before finishing at the &quot;Asanogawa Ohashi&quot; bridge.

Other events during the festival include tea ceremonies staged in Kenroku-en, performances of traditional arts and folk dancing, a &quot;Miss Hyakumangoku&quot; beauty contest, and a children&#x27;s drum and lantern parade.

<doc id="970992" wikidata="Q6011093" url="?curid=970992" title="Yaksha">
<text>The Yakshas (, , ) are a broad class of nature spirits, usually benevolent, but sometimes mischievous or capricious, connected with water, fertility, trees, the forest, treasure and wilderness. They appear in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, as well as ancient and medieval era temples of South Asia and Southeast Asia as guardian deities. The feminine form of the word is or [[Yakshini]] (, ; ).

In Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts, the s have a dual personality. On the one hand, a may be an inoffensive nature-fairy, associated with woods and mountains; but there is also a darker version of the , which is a kind of (bhuta) that haunts the wilderness and waylays and devours travellers, similar to the rakṣasas.

==Early yakshas==

Yakshas appear in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist texts. Several monumental yakshas are known from the time of the Maurya Empire period. They are variously dated from around the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century BCE. These statues are monumental (usually around 2 metres tall), and often bear inscriptions related to their identification as yakshas. They are considered as the first known monumental stone sculptures in India. Two of these monumental yakshas are known from Patna, one from Vidisha and one from Parkham, as well as one yakshini from Vidisha. The may have originally been the tutelary deity of a city, district, lake, or well. Their worship, together with popular belief in nagas (serpent deities), feminine fertility deities, and mother goddesses, may have had its origin among the early Hindu people of India. Yaksha worship coexisted with the priest-conducted sacrifices of the Vedic period. They were later viewed as the steward deities of the earth and the wealth buried beneath.

===Kubera===
In Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Religion, Kubera, wealth and prosperity, is considered the king of the yakshas and protector of the world (&quot;Lokapāla&quot;). In Buddhism, he is equated with Vaiśravaṇa.
His many epithets extol him as the overlord of numerous semi-divine species and the owner of the treasures of the world. Kubera is often depicted with a plump body, adorned with jewels, carrying a money-pot and a club. His vahana (vehicle) is the mongoose. He is often seen with Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.

==In Buddhism==


In Buddhist literature, the are the attendants of Vaiśravaṇa, the guardian of the northern quarter, a beneficent god who protects the righteous. The term also refers to the Twelve Heavenly Generals who guard , the Medicine Buddha. The yakshas of many Buddhist stories are ugly ogres, reborn in that form because of sins committed during their past lives as humans.

One such malevolent yaksha, Silesaloma, appears in the Jataka tales of the Pali Buddhist canon. In the story &quot;Prince Five-Weapons and the Sticky-Haired Demon&quot;, Silesaloma is described as being the height of a palm tree, with sharp teeth and two yellow tusks, and a coat of thick, matted fur. A bodhisattva named Prince Panchayudha (Five-Weapons) attempted to kill Silesaloma, but all his attacks, from both his weapons and his bare hands, were thwarted by Silesaloma&#x27;s sticky hair. Ultimately, Prince Panchayudha impressed Silesaloma with his bravery, and the yaksha decided to let him go. Panchayudha explained that Silesaloma&#x27;s monstrous state was caused by wicked deeds from his past lives, and he taught the yaksha the five precepts, after which Silesaloma renounced violence and transformed into a friendly forest spirit.

The Mahāmāyūrīvidyārājñī Sūtra, a text that dates back to fourth century or earlier (translated from the Sanskrit by Kumarajiva), gives a large list of yakshas that reside in the classical cities of ancient India who are invoked to seek the protection of the BuddhaDharma:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;The deity Krakucchanda resides in Pataliputra.
Aparajita resides in Sthuno.
The great yaksha Bhadra resides in Saila.
The great deity Manava resides in Uttara.
The great sage Vajrapani though lives in Rajagrha
Often dwells in Mount Grdhrakuta.
The deity Garuda resides in the Vipula mountain.
Citragupta resides in Citemukha.
The yaksha Vakula resides in Rajagrha.
The yaksha king Mahagiri resides in Girinagara.
The yaksha Vasava resides in Vaidisa.
The yaksha Karttikeya resides in Rohitaka.
This yaksha Kumara is renowned in the great city.
Vaisravana who resides in the city Alakavati,
Located along the jewelled stairway of the Buddha&#x27;s descent,
Is surrounded by billions of gods and goddesses.
Such yakshas command huge and powerful contingents of troops
To subjugate adversaries and enemies,
Conquering all.
They are famous throughout all directions.
Imbued with great dignity and virtue,
They come to aid
In the battles between the heavens and asuras.

These deities of virtues and great yaksha generals are located everywhere in Jambudvipa. They uphold and protect the Buddhadharma, generating compassion.&quot;

&lt;/poem&gt;
==In Jainism==

Jains mainly maintain cult images of Arihants and Tirthankaras, who have conquered the inner passions and attained moksha. &quot;Yakshas&quot; and &quot;yakshinis&quot; are found in pair around the cult images of Jinas, serving as guardian deities. The &quot;yaksha&quot; is generally on the right-hand side of the Jina image while the &quot;yakshini&quot; is on the left-hand side. They are regarded mainly as devotees of the Jina and have supernatural powers. They are also wandering through the cycles of births and deaths just like the worldly souls, but have supernatural powers.
The Harivamsapurana (783 CE) refers to them as Shasandevatas. Initially among the yakshas, Manibhadra and Purnabadra yakshas and Bahuputrika yakshini were popular. The yaksha Manibhadra is worshipped by the Jains affiliated with the Tapa Gachchha. During tenth and thirteenth centuries yaksha Saarvanubhuti, or Sarvahna and yakshinis Chakreshvari, Ambika, Padmavati, and Jwalamalini became so popular that independent temples devoted to them were erected.

Yakshas and yakshinis are common among the Murtipujaka Śvētāmbara and Bispanthi Digambara Jains. The Digambara Terapanth movement opposes their worship. Among the Murtipujaka Śvētāmbaras, the Tristutik Gaccha sect (both historical founded by Silagana and Devabhadra, and the modern sect organised by Rajendrasuri) object to the worship of shruta-devatas.

===Shasan devatas in Jainism===
In Jainism, there are twenty-four yakshas and twenty-four yakshis that serve as śāsanadevatās for the twenty-four tirthankaras: These yakshas are as follows:
* Gomukha
* Mahayaksha
* Trimukha
* Yaksheshvara or Yakshanayaka
* Tumbaru
* Kusuma
* Varanandi or Matanga
* Vijaya or Shyama
* Ajita
* Brahma or Brahmeshvara
* Ishvara or Yakset
* Kumara
* Dandapani
* Patala
* Kinnara
* Kimpurusha or Garuda
* Gandharva
* Kendra or Yakshendra
* Kubera
* Varuna
* Bhrikuti
* Gomedha or Sarvahna
* Dharanendra or Parshvayaksha
* Matanga

==In poems==
In Kālidāsa&#x27;s poem &quot;Meghadūta&quot;, for instance, the narrator is a romantic figure, pining with love for his missing beloved. By contrast, in the didactic Hindu dialogue of the  &quot;Questions of the &quot;, it is a tutelary spirit of a lake that challenges .

In &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; poem of Sri Lanka, a local population is given the term Yakkhas. Prince Vijaya encountered the royalty of the yakkhas&#x27; queen, Kuveni, in her capital of Lanka pura and conquered them.

==In Nepal==

In Nepal, squat stone versions of yakshas (sometimes twinned) were used as elements in construction. Their role was that of a caryatid, which supports a part of the building, for example a column. However, they are best known for their appearance under the spouts of ancient drinking fountains, especially fountains built in the Licchavi era (c. 400–750 AD). Bhagiratha sculptures are more commonly found under spouts from the Malla period (c. 1201–1779 AD).

==In Thailand==

Yakshas (, ) are an important element in Thai temple art and architecture. They are common as guardians of the gates in Buddhist temples throughout the country since at least the 14th century. Ceramic sculptures of guardian yakshas were produced in Thailand, during the Sukhothai and Ayutthaya periods, between the 14th and 16th centuries, at several kiln complexes in northern Thailand. They are mostly depicted with a characteristic face, having big round bulging eyes and protruding fangs, as well as a green complexion. Yakshas and their female counterparts are common in the Buddhist literature of Thailand, such as in The Twelve Sisters and Phra Aphai Mani. As ogres, giants, and ogresses, yakshas are present as well in Thai folklore.

 &quot;&quot; is also used as an illustration in order to name the letter ย, the 34th consonant of the Thai alphabet, according to the traditional letter symbols Thai children use to memorise the alphabet.

==In Sri Lanka==
Yakshas are regarded as one of the ancient clans of Sri Lanka. The word &quot;Yagasha&quot; has been found in a cave inscription in Tamketiya in Nailgala, Kaltota written in early Brahmi script. Professor Raj Somadeva translates the word as &#x27;belonging
to Yakshas&#x27; or &#x27;who wrote this inscription are Yakshas&#x27;. In Sinhalese, Demons
are also known as &quot;yakshayo&quot; (Singular: &quot;Yakshaya&quot;).

<text>Dioner Favian Navarro Vivas (born February 9, 1984) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa Bay Rays, Cincinnati Reds, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox and Toronto Blue Jays. With the Rays, Navarro was an All-Star in 2008.

==Professional career==
===New York Yankees===
On August 21, 2000, Navarro was signed by the New York Yankees as an amateur free agent. He made his professional debut in 2001 with the GCL Yankees, batting .280 in 43 games. In 2002, Navarro split the season between the Single-A Greensboro Bats and the High-A Tampa Yankees, accumulating a .239/.327/.361 slash line with 8 home runs and 36 RBI. In 2003, with the Double-A Trenton Thunder, he hit .341 in 58 games and was selected as the Yankees minor league player of the year and was the top-ranked prospect in the Yankees organization heading into 2004. He was assigned to the Double-A Trenton Thunder to begin the 2004 season before receiving a promotion to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers later in the year.

Navarro made his Major League debut with the Yankees on September 7, 2004, playing against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and played in seven games, batting .429 (3-for-7) with one RBIs and two runs scored.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
On January 11, 2005, Navarro was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks with Javier Vázquez and Brad Halsey in exchange for Randy Johnson. That same day, the Diamondbacks traded Navarro, Beltrán Pérez, Danny Muegge, and William Juarez to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Shawn Green. Navarro split the 2005 season between the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s and the Dodgers, batting .273 with 3 home runs and 14 RBI in 50 games with the big league club.

In 2006, both Navarro and Russell Martin were invited to spring training to compete for the starting catcher position. Both played well, but at the end of the spring Navarro was named the Dodgers&#x27; catcher, and Martin was sent to Triple-A. However, while Martin thrived in Las Vegas, Navarro played only adequately in Los Angeles, and showed signs of inexperience. On May 5, 2006, Martin was called up to the Dodgers after a wrist injury landed Navarro on the disabled list. Martin played well after the injury to Navarro, and kept the job as catcher, as Navarro was demoted to the minor leagues. In 25 games with the Dodgers in 2006, Navarro logged a .280/.372/.387 slash with 2 home runs and 8 RBI.

===Tampa Bay Rays===
On June 26, 2006, Navarro was traded along with pitcher Jae Seo and outfielder Justin Ruggiano to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for catcher Toby Hall and pitcher Mark Hendrickson. Navarro made his debut as a Ray on June 28, 2006, against the Florida Marlins going hitless with two walks. In 2007, he batted only .227 and tied for the lead of all Major League catchers in errors, with 14.

Navarro was much improved in 2008, after working on his hitting and his strength in the Venezuelan Winter League with Tiburones de La Guaira, leading his team with a .295 batting average and guiding his pitchers to the third-lowest ERA in the majors (3.60) as of July 10. On July 6, it was announced that Navarro was selected to be on the American League squad for the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. He finished the year with a .295/.349/.407 slash with 7 home runs and 54 RBI in 120 games. During the 2008 offseason, Navarro went to arbitration with the Rays; he lost and was given $2.1 million. In 2009, Navarro slashed .218/.261/.322 with 8 home runs and 32 RBI. Of all AL players with at least 350 plate appearances in 2009, only one had a lower OBP, two had a lower AVG, and two had a lower SLG.

Navarro&#x27;s batting average continued to slide in 2010, resulting in the loss of playing time to John Jaso and Kelly Shoppach. Shortly after the latter returned from injury, Navarro was sent to the Rays&#x27; Triple-A team, Durham Bulls, having cleared waivers because of service time. On December 2, 2010, Navarro became a free agent.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (second stint)===
On December 14, 2010, Navarro signed a one-year contract to return to the Dodgers for the 2011 season. He began the season on the disabled list due to an injury suffered in spring training and did not join the Dodgers until April 25. Three times during the season (June 19, July 9, and July 20), he drove in the sole run in a 1–0 victory, which only happened once before (Gary Sheffield in 2001) in Los Angeles Dodger history. Navarro was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on August 23, 2011. In 64 games, he batted .193 with five home runs and 17 runs batted in. He was released on August 30.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On January 16, 2012, Navarro signed a minor league contract, containing a spring training invite, with the Cincinnati Reds organization. He was assigned to the Triple-A Louisville Bats. Navarro was called up on August 1, due to the injury and suspension of Devin Mesoraco. Navarro hit .290 with 2 home runs and 12 RBI in 24 games for Cincinnati. He became a free agent following the season.

===Chicago Cubs===
On November 15, 2012, Navarro signed a one-year, $1.75 million deal with the Chicago Cubs, worth up to $250K in performance bonuses. On May 29, 2013, Navarro walked once, hit three home runs, scored four runs, and totaled six RBI to lead the Cubs to a 9–3 victory over the crosstown rival Chicago White Sox at Wrigley Field. It was Navarro&#x27;s first multi-HR game in his Major League career and included home runs from both sides of the plate. He finished the year with a .300/.365/.492 slash line paired with 13 home runs and 34 RBI.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 2, 2013, Navarro agreed to a two-year, $8 million deal with the Toronto Blue Jays. The official announcement came later that day. He was placed on the bereavement list on May 14, due to a family medical emergency. On August 23, Navarro recorded his 55th RBI of the season, establishing a new career-high. He would go on to start 102 games behind the plate and appear in 139 games in 2014, both career-highs, and record just 3 errors. Navarro finished the season batting .274 with 12 home runs and 69 RBI.

After the offseason signing of Russell Martin, Navarro was demoted to backup catcher to open the 2015 season. He requested a trade shortly after the Blue Jays signed Martin, specifically to a team where he could be the starting catcher, but a trade was not completed by the start of the season. On April 23, Navarro was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a strained left hamstring. He completed a rehab assignment with the Buffalo Bisons and was activated from the disabled list on June 2. Navarro appeared in 54 games in the 2015 regular season, and hit .246 with 5 home runs and 20 RBI. He had the second-slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.5 feet/second.

===Chicago White Sox===

On December 4, 2015, Navarro signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the Chicago White Sox. Navarro played in 85 games for the White Sox in 2016, batting .210 with 6 home runs and 32 RBI.

===Toronto Blue Jays (second stint)===
On August 26, 2016, Navarro was traded back to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for minor league pitcher Colton Turner. Navarro played in 16 games with the Blue Jays in 2016, hitting .182 with three RBI. On November 3, he became a free agent.

===Long Island Ducks===
Navarro did not play in a game in 2017, after helping his wife through &quot;significant health issues&quot;. On July 31, 2018, Navarro signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. In 20 games with the Ducks, Navarro slashed .268/.299/.437 with 3 home runs and 13 RBI. He became a free agent following the 2018 season.

===Cleveland Indians===
On February 7, 2019, Navarro signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was assigned to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers, and spent the season with the team, batting .211/.339/.274 with 1 home run and 11 RBI in 30 games. On September 30, Navarro was released by the Indians organization.

==Personal life==
Navarro was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and married his wife, Sherley, at age 18; they have a son, Dioner Jr. (born 2005), and she has a son, Gerson, from a previous relationship. They have lived in the Tampa Bay Area during offseasons since he was drafted and first signed by the Yankees, and currently live in Riverview, Florida.

On September 27, 2003, their first wedding anniversary, Sherley suffered a cerebral aneurysm in Tampa. Doctors gave her less than a 5% chance of surviving surgery, and said it was likely she would die on September 30. She survived, and made a full recovery. Navarro has worn the #30 in her honor ever since.

On July 5, 2006, days after his acquisition by the Devil Rays, Navarro&#x27;s SUV was clipped by another vehicle, causing his SUV to roll over. He and his family escaped serious injury, but the other vehicle fled the scene.

His son, Dioner Jr., was born with multicystic dysplastic kidney. He needed to have one of his kidneys removed in September 2006, and further surgery in 2007.

His mother, who still resides in Venezuela, suffered a cerebral aneurysm in early February 2008. Navarro left the Rays&#x27; pre-spring training workouts to be with her and returned when her condition stabilized.

Navarro is an animal lover who has five pets: Lilo (a French bulldog), Crystal (English bulldog), a chameleon called Jeffrey, and two birds that do not have names.

<doc id="971002" wikidata="Q1759144" url="?curid=971002" title="Australian Embassy bombing in Jakarta">
<text>A one-tonne car bomb, which was packed into a small Daihatsu delivery van, exploded outside the Australian embassy at Kuningan District, South Jakarta, at about 10:30 local time (03:30 UTC) on 9 September 2004, killing 9 people including the suicide bomber, and wounding over 150 others. The explosion gutted the Greek embassy on the 12th floor of an adjacent building, where three diplomats were slightly wounded. Damage to the nearby Chinese embassy was also reported. Numerous office buildings surrounding the embassy were also damaged by the blast, which shattered windows in buildings away, injuring many workers inside, mostly by broken glass.

A dispute ensued as to how many civilians were killed by the explosion: local health authorities in Jakarta reported 9 deaths, compared to 11 deaths reported by Australian officials. Nonetheless, all Australians working at the embassy were reported alive. Among the victims killed were embassy security guard Anton Sujarwo, 23, and four Indonesian policemen on duty at the embassy. The rest were civilians, including the embassy gardener, Suryadi, 34, two embassy workers, a visa applicant, and a pedestrian.

==Reactions==
Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed his &quot;utter dismay at this event&quot; and Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said, &quot;this was aimed at the Australian Embassy, there&#x27;s no question of that&quot; and that the investigators&#x27; &quot;suspicions turn to Jemaah Islamiah&quot;.
It is unclear whether the incident was intended to influence either of the two upcoming regional
elections: the final stage of the Indonesian presidential elections scheduled for 20 September, or the Australian elections scheduled for 9 October.

The Australian Opposition Leader Mark Latham said &quot;The terrorists responsible for this attack are evil and barbaric and must be dealt with as harshly as possible and as quickly as possible&quot; and committed the Labor Party&#x27;s &quot;full support to all efforts by the Australian and Indonesian governments to ensure that happens&quot;.

A grainy photograph of a white delivery van suspected of carrying the bomb and the attackers was released by Indonesian police. Downer said that a mobile phone text message was sent to Indonesian authorities about 45 minutes before the bomb detonated, warning of attacks unless the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah Abu Bakar Bashir was released, and said that the warning was not delivered to the Australian Federal Police until several hours after the bombing. Indonesian police said that they did not receive such a message.

This was the third recent major attack involving Australians or Australian targets in Indonesia, after the 2002 Bali bombings, and the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing. The executors of that attack, Jemaah Islamiyah, were also head suspects for this bombing.

==Investigation==
Responsibility for the attack was claimed by Jemaah Islamiyah, an organisation which has also claimed responsibility for multiple attacks including the 2002 Bali bombings and alleged to have links with al-Qaeda. An Islamist web site, www.islamic-minbar.com, posted a statement by Jemaah Islamiyah saying:

Police announced that Azahari Husin and Noordin Mohammed Top were suspected of being behind the bombing; Azahari was killed in a police raid in November 2005 at Batu, East Java, while Noordin was killed on 17 September 2009 at Surakarta, Central Java.

On 1 October 2004, authorities identified the suicide bomber as Heri Golun, based on DNA tests done at the scene.

On 10 November 2004, Indonesian police arrested Rois, also known as Iwan Dharmawan, along with five other suspects in Merak, Banten. During questioning, Rois claimed that he had received funds for the attack from a courier that was sent by Osama Bin Laden via Malaysia.

He told police: &quot;According to Dr Azahari’s explanation to me at the time, the funds came from Osama bin Laden, and they were sent by a courier, but he didn’t say the name or when he received it&quot;.

He stated that the motivation for the bombing was Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq war: &quot;The intention to bomb the Australian embassy was because the Australian government is the American lackey most active in supporting American policies to slaughter Muslims in Iraq.&quot;

On 13 September 2005, Rois was sentenced to death for his role in the bombing but appeared to recant his earlier confession by telling the court: &quot;I reject the death sentence. I reject a day or even an hour of sentence because I&#x27;m innocent and I wasn&#x27;t involved in this.&quot;

An appeal by Rois&#x27;s lawyers against the death penalty was rejected by the Indonesian High Court in December 2005.

On 5 May 2006 the International Crisis Group released its report entitled &quot;Terrorism in Indonesia&quot;. It described the events leading up the attack;
On 5 August, at Noordin’s instructions, Rois set off to retrieve Heri Golun, who had been selected as the suicide bomber, and buy the Daihatsu vehicle that was used in the bombing. He enlisted the help of Irun Hidayat in both tasks. From then until 17 August, frantic activity moving the principals, purchasing additional materials for the bombs and raising funds – alternated with lulls, when the operatives went to Internet cafes to pass the time. On 17 August, Noordin asked Rois to check on Heri Golun’s state of mind. When Heri said he was ready, he moved into the house where Noordin and Azhari were and slept in their room at night, so they could give him additional religious counselling. On 23 August, Rois started to teach Heri Golun how to drive, and on 9 September, the new driver blew himself in front of the Australian embassy.

In March 2005, Irun Hidayat was charged with being an accessory by giving money to one of the bombing&#x27;s perpetrators and providing housing after the attack for Azahari and Noordin. On 21 July, he was convicted of being an accessory by providing a house to Azahari and Noordin, but not to having planned the September attack, and was sentenced to three years in jail. Hidayat was the first man to stand trial related to the embassy bombing. According to the ICG report:

Irun Hidayat was also a central figure. Inducted into Darul Islam by Kang Jaja in 1987 at fifteen, he was in the same class at Serang Islamic High School as Imam Samudra and Heri Hafidin, one of the three owners of CV Sajira. He became a close friend of Rois, and the two went to Ambon in January 2002. Irun became a martial arts instructor in the military training sessions run by Kang Jaja and Rois.
Since 1999, Irun also had been the local head of the religious council of the Indonesian Muslim Workers Union (Perserikatan Pekerja Muslim Indonesia, PPIM). He was to call on a fellow unionist to put up the bombers the night before they struck the embassy

Agus Ahmad was also captured and put on trial. He helped one of the core bombers, &quot;Rios&quot;, scout for safe houses and transported around 70 kilograms of highly explosive TNT. Arrests in July 2004 near the city of Solo forced Azahari and Noordin to change their base of operations. Agus used a Daihatsu van to move the explosives to his own house in Cianjur, West Java.

<text>Disney&#x27;s Castaway Cay, or simply Castaway Cay (), is a private island in the Bahamas which serves as an exclusive port for the Disney Cruise Line ships. It is located near Great Abaco Island and was formerly known as Gorda Cay. In 1997, The Walt Disney Company purchased a 99-year land lease (through 2096) for the cay from the Bahamian government, giving the company substantial control over the island.

Castaway Cay was the first private island in the cruise industry where the ship docks on the island, eliminating the need for guests to be tendered to land.

The island is still largely undeveloped as only 55 of the are being used. Castaway Cay has approximately 140 Disney Cruise Line permanent residents who keep the island running daily.

==History==
===Gorda Cay===
In 1654 the Spanish Galleon &quot;Jesus María de la Médica Concepción&quot;, also known as &quot;El Capitan&quot; - as it was the lead vessel in the fleet, sank off the coast of Ecuador. The ship was hauling 3 million pesos of silver, 2,212 ingots, 216 chests of coins, and 22 boxes of wrought silver. Silver salvaged from the ship by the Spanish was taken to Cuba and loaded upon the &quot;Nuestra Senora del la Maravilla&quot;, but it too sank on January 4, 1656. The silver was salvaged again, and loaded upon the &quot;Madama do Brasil&quot;, which then sank near Gorda Cay in 1657.

Gorda Cay was first settled in 1783. In 1844, the &quot;Pantheon&quot; encountered Gale force winds causing it to loose its sails, and for a fire to break out. The ship ran ashore near Gorda Cay, and burnt to the waterline. The crew were rescued by the &quot;Water Witch&quot;. In 1846, the Brig &quot;Monument&quot; of Portland was sailing to Matanzas, carrying a cargo of boards, shooks, and fish, when it &quot;was totally wrecked on Gorda Cay.&quot; The cargo and materials were recovered, taken to Charleston, South Carolina and sold. 

In 1884, the ship &quot;George B. Douglass&quot; was sailing from Roatán for Nassau, when was caught in a heavy storm and developed a leak. Captain Anderson and his crew escaped in lifeboat. &quot;Shortly after they had pushed away from the schooner she gave lurch to one said and then disappeared.&quot; The crew was drifting off Gorda Cay when they were found by the schooner &quot;Isle of June&quot; and were towed to Nassau.

On Sunday, August 12, 1928, the SS &quot;Munamar&quot; owned by Munson Steamship Line, ran aground Gorda Cay and was unable to free itself. The passengers were removed Monday, August 13, by the tug boat &quot;Lady Cordeaux&quot;. Monday, August 20, it was reported the ship was successfully refloated.

Gorda&#x27;s airstrip (now Castaway Cay Airport) was once used as a stop in the 1930s for bootleggers and later, drug runners.

In 1934, reports started circulating of ancient gold coins and earthen jars being found on the island. Otis Barton conducted dives around the island investigating claims of sunken treasure, but turned up nothing. In 1950, two men, Roscoe Thompson and Howard Lightbourne, uncovered a 72-pound silver bar with a casting mark of 1652, from the seafloor near Gorda Cay. News of the discovery was withheld until after it could be authenticated. The silver bar was sold by the men to Albert E. Worswick, who then donated it to the Bahamas Development Board, where it was then displayed at the tourist information center. 

Author John Alden Knight notably visited the island in August 1953 to catch Bonefish.

In October 1953, it was heavily reported that author Harry E. Rieseberg discovered the wreck of &quot;El Capitan&quot;, off the coast of Gorda Cay. In actuality, it was the &quot;Madama do Brasil&quot; that had been hauling the recovered treasure of &quot;El Capitan&quot;. Rieseberg published his book, &quot;The Sea of Treasures&quot; based on his work recovering artifacts from the wreck. Roscoe Thompson and Howard Lightbourne, doubting the publicity behind Rieseberg&#x27;s discovery, returned to Gorda Cay in 1956 to continue their search for the lost treasure of &quot;Madama do Brasil&quot;.

In 1954, Gorda Cay was promoted as an island to visit for good fishing opportunities. Afterwards, a fishing competition was held around the island in 1956.

In 1958, a film entitled &quot;Treasure of Gorda Cay&quot; entered production, with a story written by John Steinbeck, The brain child of producer Kevin McClory, it was to star Burgess Meredith. Juano Hernandez scouted additional filming locations in North Carolina. McClory was unable to raise the funds for the film, and it never came to fruition.

On Saturday, November 11, 1961, Captain Julian Harvey of the &quot;Bluebelle&quot;, took the ships guests, the Duperrault family, to visit Gorda Cay. Notoriously, on November 12, he would commit mass murder, with only the family&#x27;s 11-year old Terry managing to survive.

Gorda Cay had also been used for filming. The beach where Tom Hanks first encounters Daryl Hannah in &quot;Splash&quot; is on the island, and parts of the film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; were filmed on the cay as well.

===Castaway Cay===
In 1997, the Disney Cruise Line purchased a 99-year lease for Gorda Cay from the Bahamian government and renamed it Castaway Cay, intending for it to be the line&#x27;s private island. The company spent $25 million over 18 months of construction. This included dredging 50,000 truckloads of sand from the Atlantic Ocean. The pier and its approaches (a 1,700 foot channel) were constructed to allow Disney ships to dock directly alongside the island, thus removing the need for tenders to get the passengers ashore.

An additional race, Castaway Cay Challenge, was added to the Walt Disney World Marathon weekend series in 2015 with the 5K race taking place on Castaway Cay.

==Facilities==

A post office on the island has special Bahamian postage and postmark specific to Disney Cruise Line. The island is developed in the theme of a castaway community with buildings made to look as if they had been improvised after a shipwreck. The facilities are maintained like any other Disney theme park; the shops accept guests&#x27; stateroom keys for payment. Food service is operated as an extension of the cruise package. A variety of activities are available to guests including bicycle rentals, personal watercraft rentals, massages overlooking the ocean, snorkeling, parasailing, volleyball, and basketball. There are monkey bars and a rope for children to climb across set about into the ocean on one beach and a slide about into the ocean on another beach. There are three beaches for guests: one exclusively for families, one exclusively for cabana guests, and another exclusively for adults, called Serenity Bay.

Two submarine-ride vehicles from the now-closed 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: Submarine Voyage ride at Walt Disney World lie underwater in the snorkeling area. The &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; pirate ship, from the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series, was formerly on display in the lagoon, but as of November 2010, it had been removed and taken to another location on the island where it was dismantled.

===Airport===

Castaway Cay Airport is a private use airport located in Castaway Cay, the Bahamas.

<text>Paul Shmyr (January 18, 1946 – September 2, 2004) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) and National Hockey League (NHL). He featured in the 1971 Stanley Cup Finals with the Chicago Black Hawks and the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals with the Minnesota North Stars.

==Playing career==
Shmyr was one of the top defensive stars in the short history of the WHA, noted for his hard-nosed play, having jumped from the NHL&#x27;s California Golden Seals to the upstart Cleveland Crusaders. He played four seasons for Cleveland, garnering the league&#x27;s top defenceman trophy in 1976. He subsequently played for the WHA&#x27;s San Diego Mariners, where he enjoyed his best offensive campaign, and played two years for the Edmonton Oilers, captaining the club to a regular season league championship in the WHA&#x27;s final season. As captain, he elected to wear a Cyrillic &quot;К&quot; instead of the customary captain&#x27;s &quot;C&quot; due to his Ukrainian heritage.

After the WHA folded, the Minnesota North Stars, which owned his rights, reclaimed him, and as a noted leader, was named to captain the North Stars in 1979. While the Stars&#x27; captain, he led them to a semifinal appearance in 1980 and to the 1981 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the New York Islanders. He then signed with the Hartford Whalers as a free agent in 1981 and retired after one season.

Shmyr was named to the WHA First Team All-Star Team in 1973, 1974, and 1976, and to its Second Team All-Star Team in 1979. He finished third in the WHA&#x27;s career leaders for games played, twentieth in assists, and fourth in penalty minutes. He represented Canada at the 1974 Summit Series and was one of only two WHAers (the other being Bobby Hull) to be invited to try out for Team Canada at the 1976 Canada Cup, though he failed to make the team.

He was from a hockey-playing family; his younger brother John Shmyr also played in the WHA. Shmyr died of throat cancer in 2004, at the age of 58.

==Honours==
In 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame.

<text>Fun Boy Three were an English new wave pop band, active from 1981 to 1983 and formed by singers Terry Hall, Neville Staple and Lynval Golding after they left the Specials. They released two albums and had seven UK top 20 hits.

==History==
Fun Boy Three reduced the ska sound that they and Jerry Dammers had crafted with great success with the Specials and initially took a more minimal approach with the focus on percussion and vocals. For their second album they assembled a six-piece backing group including a cellist and a trombone player, allowing the record to feature more diverse and expansive arrangements, and also enabling them to play live instead of being a purely studio group as previously. The band enjoyed six UK top 20 singles, starting with &quot;The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)&quot; and including the top 10 hits &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot;, &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; and &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;. They created two albums of which the eponymous debut was the more successful. The follow-up album &quot;Waiting&quot;, produced by David Byrne, was well-received critically.

Following the trio&#x27;s last UK hit &quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot;, co-written by Terry Hall and Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go&#x27;s, who had a U.S. hit with the song a year earlier, they then toured the United States and split afterwards.

They were credited with helping launch the career in 1982 of Bananarama, whom Hall first saw in &quot;The Face&quot; magazine. The three women provided credited chorus vocals on the hit &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot;; the Fun Boy Three later sang on the Bananarama song &quot;Really Saying Something&quot;, both reaching the top 5 in the UK.

<doc id="971056" wikidata="Q1619582" url="?curid=971056" title="Red Faction II">
<text>Red Faction II is a first-person shooter video game developed by Volition and published by THQ for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, Windows and Xbox. It is the sequel to &quot;Red Faction&quot; and the second installment in the &quot;Red Faction&quot; series. The game changed the direction of the first game by introducing a greater emphasis on action and a new setting on Earth, rather than Mars.

==Gameplay==

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Red Faction II&quot; features local multiplayer. Deathmatch, Bagman, Arena (all available with either individual or team play), Capture the Flag, and &quot;Regime&quot; (an unlockable mode equivalent to Bagman) can be played across a selection of around 40 levels, each with destructible walls. Every game mode except Capture the Flag has the same stage set; Capture the Flag has another set of levels dedicated to it.

Players can also create their own bots. Bots, like the human players, are able to keep statistics pertaining to gameplay. Bots obtain more statistic points as they fight matches in multiplayer, which allows the player to upgrade their abilities as they are used. These statistics include Health, Damage, Agility, and Accuracy. There are also two other stats pertaining to their gameplay: Camping Tendency and Aggressiveness.

==Plot==
In 2080, 5 years after the events of &quot;Red Faction&quot;, the nanotechnology developed by Axel Capek, the head scientist of the Ultor Corporation prior to its fall, has been claimed by the Earth Defense Force (EDF). With this technology, the EDF commences a reorganization of the Ultor Corporation with a particular focus on enhanced supersoldiers and suitable weaponry. However, the research that was done by Capek in his laboratories has been consequently stolen by other militant groups and assorted terrorist organizations. This has gone on for years; the research has changed hands in the criminal underworld many times. The player is introduced to their role as an explosives expert (codenamed &quot;Alias&quot;) as he embarks on a special operations mission to claim the research data for the Republic of the Commonwealth.

Eventually, the research is successfully claimed by the elite forces of Victor Sopot, Chancellor of the dystopic military state known as The Commonwealth. Sopot uses the nanotechnology to enhance his already formidable military forces, and successfully creates the first supersoldiers with the research data. However, fearing the potential of his new supersoldiers, he orders them all to be hunted down, executed, and replaced with far less intelligent, mutated horrors known as &quot;The Processed&quot;. Collectively betrayed by their leader, the player&#x27;s squad flees underground and ally themselves with the Red Faction as mercenaries. The Red Faction at this point in the story is an organized resistance movement that is strongly opposed to the rule of Sopot and the skewed political tenets of The Commonwealth. The squad eventually pursues Sopot and neutralizes all opposition in their way as the Red Faction takes the conflict to the streets in a joint uprising against the rule of The Commonwealth. During the initial stages of the game, the Red Faction and the squad mutually support each other as they overcome shared objectives such as sabotaging propaganda installations. The uprising culminates in successfully trapping Sopot in his missile silo and executing him.

Alias returns to the makeshift base of operations only to discover that all of the Red Faction resistance members present have been brutally slaughtered. The squad&#x27;s leader, Molov, remarks that with Sopot dead and with the nanotech research in his possession, the Commonwealth&#x27;s military forces have voluntarily pledged allegiance to him. He declares Alias and Tangier, a fellow squadmember, to be enemies of the state for supporting the Red Faction. Tangier helps Alias escape, and shortly after fleeing to safety, Alias lends aid to surviving Red Faction members who are defending themselves from the enemy. Alias and Echo, the lead of the Red Faction, meet up in a secret location to discuss an alternate strategy to stop Molov, and Echo is killed in action during a firefight with Quill, a former squadmember. Tangier radios Alias soon afterward, and the two agree to shut down Molov&#x27;s commandeered nanotech laboratory located within the colossal statue of Sopot. Inside the laboratory, Alias triumphs over Repta, a former squadmember, and destroys the nanotech laboratory&#x27;s power generators. Alias&#x27;s explosives weaken the foundation of the statue and render it unstable. Alias encounters Repta again and once again triumphs over him, causing the energy field within Repta to reach critical mass.

Alias and Tangier meet up and pursue Molov, who is scaling Sopot&#x27;s statue with the nanotech cell – the culmination of Capek&#x27;s research – and awaiting extraction from Shrike, Molov&#x27;s subordinate. Shrike betrays his commanding officer, and Tangier manages to reclaim the nanotech cell from Molov&#x27;s possession. Molov, desperate to eliminate his enemies, climbs aboard a nearby battle armor and launches a frenzied assault against Alias. Using the destructible environment to his advantage, Alias manages to evade Molov&#x27;s fire and launches a counterattack that not only kills Molov, but also destroys the statue. As the statue crumbles, Shrike swoops in with his close air support craft to extract Alias. From this point, the story ends in one of four possible ways, depending on the player&#x27;s Heroics score.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 and GameCube versions received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the Xbox and PC versions received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The game&#x27;s short campaign and lack of online multiplayer were criticized by many. Redeeming features include dual wielding, great split-screen multiplayer, and improved graphics. IGN&#x27;s positive side of their review called the PS2 version &quot;a very solid, well-produced first-person shooter&quot;, but their complaints stated that: &quot;Volition still shows some room for improvement when it comes to level design, spots of AI, and implementing the vast potential of the Geo-Mod concept.&quot; IGN was more negative about the Windows version, criticizing the port&#x27;s average looking graphics and incredibly short single-player campaign. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; said the PS2 version was enjoyable but not particularly innovative. They recommended it to fans of the original game whilst conceding that Red Faction II was &quot;not the best example of its fiercely competitive genre.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the same console version a score of six out of ten.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla&quot;, was released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows.

<doc id="971057" wikidata="Q2499453" url="?curid=971057" title="Maggie May">
<text>&quot;Maggie May&quot; is a song cowritten by singer Rod Stewart and Martin Quittenton, performed by Stewart for his album &quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot;, released in 1971. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 130 in The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2017, the Mercury Records single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
&quot;Maggie May&quot; expresses the ambivalence and contradictory emotions of a boy involved in a relationship with an older woman and was written from Stewart&#x27;s own experience. In the January 2007 issue of &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Stewart recalled: &quot;Maggie May was a true story, about the first woman I had sex with, at the 1961 Beaulieu Jazz Festival.&quot; The woman&#x27;s name was not &quot;Maggie May&quot;; Stewart has stated that the name was taken from &quot;an old Liverpudlian song about a prostitute&quot;.

The song was recorded in just two takes in one session. Drummer Micky Waller often arrived at recording sessions with the expectation that a drum kit would be provided and, for &quot;Maggie May&quot;, it was – except that no cymbals could be found. The cymbal crashes had to be overdubbed separately some days later.

The song was released as the B-side of the single &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, but soon radio stations began playing the B-side and &quot;Maggie May&quot; became the more popular side. The song was Stewart&#x27;s first substantial hit as a solo performer and launched his solo career. It remains one of his best-known songs. A 1971 performance of the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; saw the Faces joined onstage by DJ John Peel, who pretended to play the mandolin. The mandolin player on the actual recording was Ray Jackson of Lindisfarne.

The album version of &quot;Maggie May&quot; incorporates a 30-second solo guitar intro, &quot;Henry&quot;, composed by Martin Quittenton.

The original recording has appeared on almost all of Rod Stewart&#x27;s compilations, and even appeared on the Ronnie Wood retrospective &quot;Ronnie Wood Anthology: The Essential Crossexion&quot;. A version by the Faces recorded for BBC Radio appeared on the four-disc box set &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot;. A live version recorded in 1993 by Stewart joined by Wood for a session of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; is included on the album &quot;Unplugged...and Seated&quot;.

==Chart performance==
In October 1971, the song went to number one on the UK Singles Chart (for five weeks), and simultaneously topped the charts in Australia (four weeks), Canada (one week), and the United States (five weeks). It was the No. 2 record for 1971 on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and UK singles charts.

The song re-entered the UK chart in December 1976, but only reached number 31.

<text>Argyroxiphium is a small genus of plants in the family Asteraceae. Its members are known by the common names silversword or greensword due to their long, narrow leaves and the silvery hairs on some species. The silverswords belong to a larger radiation of over 50 species, including the physically different genera &quot;Dubautia&quot; and &quot;Wilkesia&quot;. This grouping is often referred to as the silversword alliance. Botanist P. H. Raven referred to this radiation as &quot;the best example of adaptive radiation in plants&quot;.

== Description ==

Species in &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot; are perennial, rosette-forming shrubs. They may consist of a single large rosette or a collection of several rosettes. In all &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot; species, long, narrow leaves contain interstitial gels hypothesized to function as water storage. For some species, leaves are covered with trichomes that provide protection from frost and create the plants&#x27; signature silver sheen.

A silversword rosette grows for at least five years before flowering, though some species grow for up to 90 years before initiating the bolting process. For monocarpic individuals with a single rosette, this ends in the death of the plant, though some individuals are polycarpic. The flowering stalks may be up to tall, and are composed of up to 600 capitulae. These flower heads range in diameter from to and consist of a ring of pistillate ray florets around 30 to 600 disk florets. The corollae vary in color from wine red to yellow or white. Because they are self-incompatible and require cross-pollination by insects, many plants must flower at the same time in relatively close proximity to set seed. A significant population must exist for enough individuals to flower simultaneously and allow pollination to occur. The single-seeded fruits are usually dispersed by wind.

Despite their different appearances, silverswords are very closely related to the genus &quot;Dubautia&quot;. Sympatric species in &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot; and &quot;Dubautia&quot; often naturally produce fertile hybrids that run the gamut of morphological characteristics from the two genera. Together, &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot;, &quot;Dubautia&quot;, and &quot;Wilkesia&quot; make up the silversword alliance.

== Evolution ==

The evolutionary roots of &quot;Argyroxiphium&quot; are the tarweeds in subtribe Madiinae. DNA analysis has revealed that silverswords form a clade within the Californian tarweed lineage. The relation is also physically evident—silversword capitulae and the flowers of Californian tarweeds both include sticky bracts that provide adhesion to birds for seed dispersal. It is hypothesized that an individual plant from the Californian tarweeds was spread first to Kauai, then spread to the other islands and developed into the silversword alliance.

== Distribution ==

Silverswords are endemic to Hawaii and occur only on the islands of Maui and Hawaii. They grow primarily over above sea level in bogs, alpine shrublands, or wet shrublands. &quot;A. sandwichense&quot; is able to grow at high altitudes between and on cinder and lava with relatively little rainfall. The Haleakalā silversword (&quot;A sandwicense&quot; ssp. &quot;macrocephalum&quot;) is constrained to Haleakalā on Maui while the Mauna Kea silversword (&quot;A. sandwicense&quot; ssp. &quot;sandwicense&quot;) is specific to Mauna Kea on Hawaii. Each of the other species is found primarily at lower altitudes with much higher annual rainfall.

== Conservation ==

The Mauna Loa or Kaū silversword (&quot;A. kauense&quot;) has been classified as critically endangered and the Mauna Kea and Halekalā silverswords (&quot;A. sandwichense&quot;) have been classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List. Direct damage from humans and from ungulate browsing have significantly damaged silversword populations, but dedicated management efforts have resulted in successful conservation of some species. In particular, the Haleakalā silversword population reached a low of approximately 4,000 plants in the 1920s, but rebounded to over 6,500 individuals by 1970. On the other hand, the Mauna Kea silversword population was composed of approximately 50 naturally occurring individuals and 500 outplanted individuals in 1999. The East Maui greensword (&quot;A. virescens&quot;) is apparently extinct, but in 1989 plants were discovered that appear to be hybrids between it and the Haleakalā silversword. The hybrid is known as the Pu&#x27;u &#x27;Alaea greensword.

<text>Alaverdi (, , Greek: Αλαβερντί), is a town and municipal community in the Lori Province at the northeastern part of Armenia, near the border with Georgia. It is located at the only direct rail link between Armenia and Georgia. Situated at the bottom of the Debed river gorge, Alaverdi is an important commercial and industrial centre in northern Armenia.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 13,343, down from 26,300 reported in 1989. Currently, the town has an approximate population of 11,000 as per the 2016 official estimate.

== Etymology ==
Historically, the area around Alaverdi was known as Manasgomer or Manits Gom during the medieval period. Starting from the 17th century, the settlement became known as Alaverdi, derived from the name of a 17th-century Turkic &quot;Borçalı&quot; tribe leader &quot;Allahverdi Mollaoğlu Tarkhan&quot;.

However, Alaverdi was formed as a settlement known as Manes (from historical Manits Gom) only in 1899, when the copper smelter was opened near the village of Madan (currently part of Alaverdi) at the northern outskirts of Sanahin village and residential barracks were built to accommodate the laborers of the smelter.

== History ==
Excavations conducted in 1931 testify that the region of modern-day Alaverdi was most probably settled during the 1st half of the 2nd millennium BC. Later, the region became part of the Urartu Kingdom between the 8th and 6th centuries BC. After the Achaemenid invasion, the region became part of the Satrapy of Armenia. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Armenia in 331 BC, the region became part of the &quot;Dzorapor&quot; canton of the historic Gugark, the 13th province of Greater Armenia.

Following the partition of Armenia in 387 between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid Persia, and the subsequent collapse of Arsacid Armenia in 428, Eastern Armenia including Dzorapor region became under the rule of Sassanid Persia. In 658, Armenia was conquered by the Arab invaders. At the end of the 9th century, Dzorapor became part of the newly established Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. In 979, King Kiurike I founded the Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget (alternatively known as the Kingdom of Lori) under the rule of the Kiurikian dynasty and the protectorate of the Bagratid kings of Armenia. The Kiurikians ruled the kingdom until 1118 when Tashir-Dzoraget became part of the Kingdom of Georgia.

The Seljuks invaded the region in the early 12th century, but their rule did not last long and in 1118-1122 the Georgian king David the Builder conquered Lori and granted the rule to the Georgian-Armenian Orbelian Dynasty. The Orbelians revolted unsuccessfully in 1177, after which a Kipchak named Khubasari was appointed &quot;spasalari&quot; of Lori. Later in 1185, the province became ruled by the Zakarian dynasty after Queen Tamar of Georgia appointed the Zakarid prince Sarkis as its governor. Between the 11th and 13th centuries, and with the establishment of the monasteries of Haghpat and Sanahin and Odzun, the region modern-day Alaverdi became a prominent centre of Armenian culture, theology and science. Scholars such as Hovhannes Imastaser, Grigor Tuteordi, Davit Kobayretsi, Grigor Magistros worked in these monasteries. However, the region was devastated by the Mongol invasion of 1236, and the Zakarian dynasty declined by the second half of the 14th century.

Lori was annexed by Safavid Persia as a result of the 1555 Peace of Amasya and became part of Persia&#x27;s Kartli-Kakheti province. After Nader Shah&#x27;s murder in 1747, the Georgian kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti became independent and united into a single kingdom by 1762. In 1801, together with the Georgian provinces of Kartli and Kakheti, Lori was annexed by the Russian Empire. The region became officially part of the Russian Empire at the Treaty of Gulistan signed on 1 January 1813 between Imperial Russia and Qajar Persia. Administratively, the region was part of the &quot;Borchali uyezd&quot; within the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire.

Under the Russian rule, a number of Pontic Greek miners were resettled in the area during the 18th century to start exploiting copper, through the efforts of the Argoutinski-Dolgoruki family. Soon after, nearly a quarter of the entire Russian copper was being mined in Alaverdi. At the end of the 19th century, the concession to exploit the mine was sold to a French firm. With the establishment of the Tbilisi-Alexandropol railway in 1899, a new copper smelter was opened near the village of &quot;Madan&quot; between Sanahin and Akori, to set the foundation for a new settlement that became the residence of the smelter staff. The newly founded settlement was renamed &quot;Manés&quot;.

In May 1918, Lori became part of the newly formed Republic of Armenia. In late 1918, Armenia and Georgia fought a border war over Lori. In January 1919, the Lori neutral zone was established by the British forces. Following Armenia&#x27;s sovietization in December 1920, Lori -including Manes- was finally incorporated into Soviet Armenia on 11 February 1921.

Under the Soviet rule, the first major plan of &quot;Manes&quot; was introduced in 1929-1930 by architect Mikayel Mazmanyan. Manes was renamed &quot;Alaverdi&quot; in 1935 and granted the status of an urban-type settlement in 1938 to become the centre of &quot;Alaverdi raion&quot;. With the gradual progress of the town as a major industrial centre of Soviet Armenia, the major plan of the town was revised and developed in 1946 by architect Hrayr Isabekyan to acquire its current socialist industrial appearance. Between 1959 and 1962, based on the design of architect Levon Cherkezyan, the southern half of the town was built in the Sanahin plateau on the right bank of Debed river.

Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Alaverdi was included within the newly formed Lori Province, as per the 1995 administrative reforms. The municipal community of Alaverdi includes the nearby rural settlement of Akner as well. Considered one of the leading industrial plants in the region, the Alaverdi copper smelter is currently operated by the ACP company since its privatization in 1997.

== Geography and climate ==

Alaverdi is on the shores of Debed river canyon 1000 meters above sea level, surrounded by high mountains and green forests. The Debed river flows through the centre of the town dividing it into 2 parts. The older northern half of Alaverdi is in the Debed canyon, and the newer southern half of the town is on the Sanahin plateau. It is surrounded by large villages including Sanahin at the southeast, Haghpat at the east, Akori at the west, and Odzun at the southwest. The Somkheti mountains dominate over the town from the north and the northwest while the Pambak mountains dominate from the south and the southwest. The Lalvar peak with a height of 2544 meters is at the northwest of the town.

Alaverdi has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk) according to the Köppen climate classification.


== Demographics ==
=== Population and ethnic groups ===

Alaverdi is mainly inhabited by ethnic Armenians with a minor Greek community that was once considered the largest in Armenia. The Greeks in Armenia speak the Pontic dialect and they are fluent in both Armenian and Russian.

The &quot;Madan&quot; neighbourhood of Alaverdi used to have a large Greek community during the Soviet period.

=== Religion ===
The majority of Alaverdi are ethnic Armenians who belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The regulating body of the church is the Diocese of Gougark, headed by Archbishop Sebouh Chouldjian (seat in Vanadzor).

The church of Saint Gregory of Narek opened in November 2001 is the town&#x27;s church. It was built through the efforts of the Alaverdi Copper Smelter, the Diocese of Gougark and the local citizens of the town.

== Culture ==
The Mikoyan Brothers Museum in Sanahin honors the brothers Anastas and Artem Mikoyan.

The Alaverdi municipal theatre founded in 1932 by Armen Armenyan is among the most significant theatres of Armenia that produced many prominent artists.

The Alaverdi traditional music band was formed in 1937 and toured all over the Soviet major cities. The band performed in Germany, France and Belgium as well. The town has also a drama theatre. It consists of a large theatre hall and a big public library.

The National Gallery of Armenia opened its Alaverdi branch in 1987.

In 1997, the Alaverdi cultural palace was opened. It is also home to the public library of the town.

The M-6 Motorway that connects Yerevan with Tbilisi, passes through Alaverdi.

The southern half of the town is connected with its northern counterpart through bridges over the Debed river, as well as a cableway.

== Economy ==

During the Georgian rule over Alaverdi region, the Alaverdi Copper Smelter was founded in 1770, by the order of Georgian king Erekle II. At the end of the 19th century, the region was flourished through the growing Russian and French investments in metallurgical business. In 1903, the amount of copper produced in Alaverdi region made around 13% of the total copper production in the Russian Empire.

By the end of 1909, the hydropower plant of Debed river was inaugurated in order to provide the developing metallurgical plants with sufficient energy.

During the Soviet rule, massive construction works were carried on in Alaverdi, including the surrounding areas of Sanahin and other villages. The Soviets made significant steps for the enlargement of the metallurgical industry in the region, which has turned Alaverdi from a small industrial settlement to a modern town within Soviet Armenia.

Recently, new plans were introduced for the expansion of copper production in Alaverdi smelter and the development of new copper mines within the frameworks of the &quot;Armenian Copper&quot; project.

Around 500 job opportunities are secured by the copper factory.

== Education ==
Gugark province was one of the major educational centres throughout the history of Armenia. The historic University of Sanahin opened in 966 AD by the efforts of the Bagratuni queen Khosrovanush, was located in the area of modern-day Sanahin village at the southeastern outskirts of Alaverdi.

Currently, the town is one of the important educational centres of Lori province. As of 2009, 10 public education schools are operating in Alaverdi with around 2,000 students. On the other hand, around 400 kids in the town are served by 6 kindergartens. The Alaverdi state intermediate college offers an opportunity of study in pedagogy with a duration of 2 years, while the Tumanynan branch of the Northern University offers degrees in nursing and dental prosthesis.

== Sport ==
=== Football ===

Alaverdi is one of the major centres of sports in Armenia. In 1936, the Metallurg Football Club of Alaverdi had participated in the lower levels of the first ever Soviet football championship, representing the Armenian SSR.

After the independence of Armenia in 1991, Debed FC represented the town in the Armenian Premier League during the 1992 season. However, like many other Armenian football clubs, Debed FC was dissolved in 1993 and is currently inactive from professional football.

In general, the sports infrastructure in Alaverdi is very poor, but some plans have been implemented by the Football Federation of Armenia to promote the game in the region. Therefore, the town&#x27;s only Metallurg Stadium, was renovated to serve the young footballers and sport schools of the Lori Province.

=== Other sports ===
During the Soviet period, Alaverdi used to have a strong handball team. The handball training school of Alaverdi named after Oleg Gorbunov (Soviet handball player during the 1960s), is still operating in since 1962. Other specialized schools for chess and boxing are also operating in the town since 2006.

<text>&quot;Garcia&quot;-class frigates were United States Navy warships. These frigates were originally ocean escorts bearing the hull classification DE until 1975. The ships were commissioned between 1964 and 1968 and decommissioned between 1988 and 1990.

==Description==
Frigates fulfill a Protection of Shipping (POS) mission as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups and merchant convoys.

The &quot;Garcia&quot; class was a larger version of the . The &quot;Garcias&quot; were followed by the similar &quot;Brooke&quot; class, which was given guided missile armament.

The &quot;Bronstein&quot; ocean escort was a response to the development of high speed nuclear submarines in the late 1950s. They were powered by steam turbines instead of diesel engines and incorporated a first class anti-submarine warfare (ASW) weapon system: the SQS-26BX sonar, MK 112 ASROC rocket launcher, and MK 32 torpedo tubes. Gun (naval artillery) armament (MK 33 3 inch/50 caliber) was changed in the &quot;Garcia&quot; class to two MK 30 5 inch/38 caliber guns.

There were two distinct breeds of ships bearing the DE hull classification, the World War II destroyer escorts (some of which were converted to DERs) and the postwar DE/DEG classes, which were known as ocean escorts despite carrying the same type symbol as the World War II destroyer escorts. All DEs, DEGs, and DERs were reclassified as FFs, FFGs, or FFRs on 30 June 1975 by the United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification.

After decommissioning, , , , and were transferred to the Brazilian Navy, as &quot;Pernambuco&quot; (D 30), &quot;Paraíba&quot; (D 28), &quot;Paraná&quot; (D 29), and &quot;Pará&quot; (D 27), respectively. &quot;Pará&quot; (D 27) remained in reserve till 2015, but appears to have been scrapped since.
 was a &quot;Garcia&quot;-class frigate modified for research use, commissioned as AGDE-1 in 1965, redesignated AGFF-1 in 1975, and redesignated FF-1098 in 1979.

<doc id="971107" wikidata="Q503142" url="?curid=971107" title="Before Present">
<text>Before Present (BP) or &quot;years before present (YBP)&quot; is a time scale used mainly in archaeology, geology, and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred relative to the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s. Because the &quot;present&quot; time changes, standard practice is to use 1January 1950 as the commencement date (epoch) of the age scale, with 1950 being labelled as the &quot;standard year&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;BP&quot; has been interpreted retrospectively as &quot;Before Physics&quot;, which refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, which scientists must account for when using radiocarbon dating for dates of origin that may fall after this year.

In a convention that is not always observed, many sources restrict the use of BP dates to those produced with radiocarbon dating; the alternative notation &quot;RCYBP&quot; stands for the explicit &quot;radio carbon years before present&quot;.

==Usage==
The BP scale is sometimes used for dates established by means other than radiocarbon dating, such as stratigraphy. This usage differs from the recommendation by van der Plicht &amp; Hogg, followed by the &quot;Quaternary Science Reviews&quot;, both of which requested that publications should use the unit &quot;a&quot; (for &quot;annum&quot;, Latin for &quot;year&quot;) and reserve the term &quot;BP&quot; for radiocarbon estimations.

Some archaeologists use the lowercase letters &quot;bp&quot;, &quot;bc&quot; and &quot;ad&quot; as terminology for uncalibrated dates for these eras.

The Centre for Ice and Climate at the University of Copenhagen instead uses the unambiguous &quot;b2k&quot;, for &quot;years before 2000 AD&quot;, often in combination with the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) time scale.

Some authors who use the YBP dating format also use &quot;YAP&quot; (&quot;years after present&quot;) to denote years after 1950.

===SI prefixes===
SI prefix multipliers may be used to express larger periods of time, e.g. &quot;ka BP&quot; (thousand years BP), &quot;Ma BP&quot; (million years BP) and many others.

== Radiocarbon dating ==
Radiocarbon dating was first used in 1949. Beginning in 1954, metrologists established 1950 as the origin year for the BP scale for use with radiocarbon dating, using a 1950-based reference sample of oxalic acid. According to scientist A. Currie Lloyd:

The year 1950 was chosen because it was the standard astronomical epoch at that time. It also marked the publication of the first radiocarbon dates in December 1949, and 1950 also antedates large-scale atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, which altered the global ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12.

== Radiocarbon calibration ==

Dates determined using radiocarbon dating come as two kinds: &quot;uncalibrated&quot; (also called &quot;Libby&quot; or &quot;raw&quot;) and &quot;calibrated&quot; (also called &quot;Cambridge&quot;) dates. &quot;Uncalibrated&quot; radiocarbon dates should be clearly noted as such by &quot;uncalibrated years BP&quot;, because they are not identical to calendar dates. This has to do with the fact that the level of atmospheric radiocarbon (carbon-14 or 14C) has not been strictly constant during the span of time that can be radiocarbon-dated. Uncalibrated radiocarbon ages can be converted to calendar dates by calibration curves based on comparison of raw radiocarbon dates of samples independently dated by other methods, such as dendrochronology (dating based on tree growth-rings) and stratigraphy (dating based on sediment layers in mud or sedimentary rock). Such calibrated dates are expressed as cal BP, where &quot;cal&quot; indicates &quot;calibrated years&quot;, or &quot;calendar years&quot;, before 1950.

Many scholarly and scientific journals require that published calibrated results be accompanied by the name (standard codes are used) of the laboratory concerned, and other information such as confidence levels, because of differences between the methods used by different laboratories and changes in calibrating methods.

==Conversion==
Conversion from Gregorian calendar years to Before Present years is by starting with the 1950-01-01 epoch of the Gregorian calendar and increasing the BP year count with each year into the past from that Gregorian date.

For example, 1000 BP corresponds to 950 AD, 1949 BP corresponds to 1 AD, 1950 BP corresponds to 1 BC, 2000 BP corresponds to 51 BC.

<text>Myles Birket Foster (4 February 1825 – 27 March 1899) was a British illustrator, watercolourist and engraver in the Victorian period. His name is also to be found as Myles Birkett Foster.

==Life and work==

Foster was born in North Shields, England of a primarily Quaker family, but his family moved south to London in 1830, where his father founded M. B. Foster &amp; sons — a successful beer-bottling company. He was schooled at Hitchin, Hertfordshire and on leaving initially went into his father&#x27;s business. However, noticing his talent for art, his father secured an apprenticeship with the wood-engraver, Ebenezer Landells, where he worked on illustrations for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine and the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. Foster&#x27;s boss was one of the founders of Punch, and for him was tasked to make and draw woodcuts, which were crafted with great finesse. Rural scenes taken from travels with his brother and friend Edmund Evans, could be supplemented by popular sporting events such as the early Oxford and Cambridge boat races. Landells was working from Fleet Street when in July 1846 a famous image of Tynemouth Priory appeared with Birket Foster&#x27;s own name; his apprenticeship had come to a conclusion.
On leaving Landells&#x27; employ, he continued to produce work for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated London Almanack&quot;, landing his first exhibition at the Suffolk Street Art Gallery, Westminster during the year 1843. His famous image of &quot;A Christmas Holly Cart&quot; was used by the new traders of seasonal cards, and included in the Illustrated London News by the end of 1848. He also found work as a book illustrator and, during the 1850s, trained himself to paint in watercolours. His illustrations of Longfellow’s &quot;Evangeline&quot; and books of poetry by other contemporaries were a great success, and he quickly became a successful artist in watercolours. He married for the first time on 13 August 1850, a young Geordie woman, and a cousin. Anne, the daughter of Robert Spence of North Shields, was descended from Robert Foster of Hebblethwaite Hall. They hailed from the hilltop gentry farming stock. Bringing a dowry and money to London, the newly-wed couple moved into a salubrious address on the edge of London at Marsden Villa, Clifton Road, on Clifton Hill in the fashionable district of St Johns Wood. Foster&#x27;s parents were residing nearby transforming the northern family into thoroughgoing Londoners.

Birket Foster became an Associate of the &quot;Old&quot; Watercolour Society (later the Royal Watercolour Society) in 1860 and exhibited some 400 of his paintings at the Royal Academy over more than 2 decades.
Birket Foster travelled widely, painting the countryside around Scotland, the Rhine Valley, the Swiss lakes and in Italy, especially Venice. In 1863 he moved to Witley, near Godalming in Surrey where he had an elaborate Tudor-style house (&quot;The Hill&quot;) built. Being friendly with Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, he had the house decorated and furnished in contemporary style, with tiles and paintings by Burne-Jones and Morris&#x27; firm, Morris and Company. The same year he published a volume of &quot;English Landscapes,&quot; with text by Tom Taylor.

Although he had painted great numbers of landscape scenes from Scotland to the Mediterranean, it was after moving to Witley that Birket Foster produced the works for which he is best known—a sentimentalised view of the contemporary English countryside, particularly in the west Surrey area. Although criticised for their idealised view of rural life, they were recognised for their detail and execution. Birket Foster&#x27;s work (along with that of other artists) was used by Cadburys, the chocolate manufacturer, on the cover of their chocolate boxes from the 1860s onwards. Printed in 1861, &quot;The Carewes: a tale of the Civil Wars&quot; was the swashbuckling royalist family history of a gentry on the edge of Windsor Forest, illustrated with fine images and a dashing flourish; it was much appreciated in America. &quot;the dainty water-colour drawings executed...appeal to the majority of the British public more than the works of any other.&quot; So wrote H.M. Cundall in 1906 in the preface to a first biography.

He became ill in 1893 and moved to Weybridge. He continued painting, but died on 27 March 1899. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; referred to him as &quot;certainly the most popular water-colour artist of our time&quot;. He is buried at All Saints&#x27; Church in Witley. 

==Friends and family==
As well as Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris, his artist friends and associates included Fred Walker, Charles Keene and William Quiller Orchardson.

In 1864, he married Frances, the daughter of Dawson Watson, and sister of the artist John Dawson Watson. Their eldest son, also called Myles Birket Foster (1851–1922), was an organist and composer who studied at the Royal College of Music with Sullivan, Prout and Frederick Westlake. He was organist and choirmaster in Marylebone and at the Foundling Hospital Chapel among other places, and music director at the publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes. He composed symphonies, overtures, children&#x27;s cantatas, a string quartet, trios and church music, and wrote a &quot;History of the Philharmonic Society&quot; (1913).

<text>Robert Allan Shivers (; October 5, 1907 – January 14, 1985) was an American politician who served as the 37th governor of Texas. Shivers was a leader of the Texas Democratic Party during the turbulent 1940s and 1950s and developed the lieutenant governor&#x27;s post into an extremely powerful perch in the state government.

==Early life and career==
Born in Lufkin, the seat of Angelina County in East Texas, Shivers was educated at the University of Texas at Austin and earned a law degree in 1933. There, he was a member of the Texas Cowboys and the Friar Society, and he served as the student body president.

In 1934, he was elected to the Texas State Senate, its youngest member ever. He served there from 1934 to 1946, except for two years&#x27; service in the US Army during World War II from which he was discharged with the rank of major.

==Lieutenant governor==
In 1946, he was elected as the 33rd lieutenant governor of Texas by defeating the Republican nominee, John A. Donaldson, in a landslide margin, with Shivers garnering 344,630 votes (91.54%) to Donaldson&#x27;s 31,835 votes (8.46%). Shivers was re-elected in 1948 by garnering 1,050,163 votes (87.47%) to the Republican Taylor Cole&#x27;s 143,887 votes (11.98%).

He is credited with developing the &quot;ideas, practices, and techniques of leadership&quot; that made the office the most powerful post in Texas government although the governor&#x27;s powers are limited by the state constitution more than in other states.

In office, Shivers initiated the practice of appointing state senators to specific committees and setting the daily agenda. Later, the Senate passed a right-to-work law, reorganized the public school system with the Gilmer-Akin laws, appropriated funds for higher education including the Texas State University for Negroes (now Texas Southern University), and provided money for improvements of state hospitals and highways.

==Governor==
=== Electoral history ===
When Governor Beauford Jester died on July 11, 1949, Shivers succeeded him, the only lieutenant governor in Texas history who has gained the governor&#x27;s office by the death of his predecessor. In 1950, Shivers won election as governor in his own right by defeating Republican Ralph W. Currie. There were 355,010 votes (89.93%) for the incumbent governor, and Currie garnered 39,737 votes (10.07%)

In 1952, Shivers proved so popular that he was listed on the gubernatorial ballot as the nominee of both the Democratic and Republican parties (Democrat Shivers handily defeated Republican Shivers). Between both parties, Shivers garnered 1,844,530 votes (98.05%) to &quot;No Preference&quot; getting 36,672 votes (1.95%). Texas law was later changed to remove the &quot;No Preference&quot; option.

Shivers then set the three-term precedent by running again and winning in 1954. He garnered 569,533 votes (89.42%) to the Republican Tod R. Adams&#x27;s 66,154 votes (10.39%).

=== Governor of Texas ===
The Shivercrats were a conservative faction of the Democratic Party in Texas in the 1950s. The faction was named for Shivers, who was criticized by liberals in the party, particularly Ralph Yarborough, for his corruption and conservatism.

Shivers supported Republican presidential nominee Dwight Eisenhower instead of Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson II during the 1952 election.

Corruption during the Shivers administration damaged his reputation and endangered his chances of re-election in 1954. Land Office Commissioner Bascom Giles was convicted of committing rampant fraud against Texas war veterans, with a disproportionate number of African-American veterans in particular, by a veterans land program under the Texas Veterans Land Board of the Texas General Land Office. Giles was the only member of the Shivers administration to go to prison, but Shivers and the state attorney general, John Ben Shepperd, as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the Veterans Land Board, were implicated in the scandal, which occurred under their watch.

The Shivercrats responded with a vicious negative campaign that tried to paint the party liberals as communists. Shivers also urged the Texas Legislature to pass a bill making membership in the Communist Party a death-penalty offense and described such membership as being &quot;worse than murder.&quot; However, a less extreme version of the proposition finally passed both Houses.

In 1956, Shivers ordered Captain Jay Banks of the Texas Ranger Division to block &quot;desegregation of Mansfield High School in Tarrant County.&quot; The Mansfield school desegregation incident was the first state action resisting enforcement of the nationwide integration of public schools ordered by the US Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

Lyndon Johnson at first aligned himself with the Shivercrats, including John Connally, but after becoming president, Johnson increasingly sided with Yarborough and the liberals on policy matters. Most of the Shivercrats either left public life or became Republicans after Johnson&#x27;s presidency, as the liberal-moderate faction was in firm control of the state party after 1970.

=== Segregation and resistance to integration ===
Shivers was anti-integration and used the office of the governor to resist legally-mandated integration in Texas. After the US Supreme Court decision ending the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), Shivers on July 27, 1955, appointed a committee, the Texas Advisory Committee on Segregation in Public Schools. The charge of this committee was to &quot;[e]xamine three major problems and present recommendations leading to their solution. The problems are: (1) The prevention of forced integration. (2) The achievement of maximum decentralization of school authority. (3) The ways in which the State government may best assist the local school districts in solving their problems.&quot; The committee members were State Senator A.M. Aiken, Jr., Earnest. E. Sanders, Mrs. Joe Fisher, J.V. Hammett, Charles Howell, Will Crews Morris, and Houston attorney, Hall E. Timanus. A legal and legislative subcommittee of the Texas Advisory Committee on Segregation in Public Schools produced a 58-page report on August 18, 1955, detailing among other ideas ways that Texas schools could resist integration and the framework for ending compulsory public school attendance for those parents who did not want their children to attend integrated schools.

The recommendations of the committee were used as justification for Shivers&#x27;s state actions in resisting integration, such as the Mansfield School Desegregation Incident.

=== Miscellaneous ===
Shivers appeared as himself in the 1955 film &quot;Lucy Gallant&quot; starring Jane Wyman and Charlton Heston.
Shivers previously held the record for longest continuous service as Texas governor at 7.5 years until June 2008, when Rick Perry surpassed Shivers&#x27;s record for continuous service. (Bill Clements initially broke Shivers&#x27;s total service record by serving eight years over two nonconsecutive terms; Perry later surpassed that record, as well.) Both Shivers and Perry are the only two Texas governors to have been inaugurated four times.

Shivers disputed the Truman administration&#x27;s claim on the Tidelands and disapproved of Truman&#x27;s veto that would have vested tideland ownership in the states. Bucking the tradition of the &quot;Solid South&quot;, Shivers delivered Texas in the 1952 presidential election for Dwight D. Eisenhower, only the second time that Texas had supported a Republican for president since Reconstruction (the other was 1928). The state Republican Party reciprocated by nominating Shivers for governor and so ran as the nominee of both parties. Shivers is believed to have lost popularity with some voters over his disloyalty to the Democratic Party. He also became less popular because of his opposition to &quot;Brown&quot; and his link to the Veterans&#x27; Land Board scandal.

Shivers helped enact laws raising teacher salaries and granting retirement benefits to state employees.

==Later career==
Shivers did not seek a fourth term in the 1956 elections. He retired from politics on January 15, 1957, and went into business.

In 1973, Democratic governor Preston Smith appointed Shivers to the University of Texas Board of Regents. In January 1975, he was elected as chairman of the board and served for four years. He donated his Austin home, Woodlawn, the historic Pease mansion, to the university to help raise funds for its law school.

In 1980, Shivers was instrumental in securing a $5 million grant for the UT Austin Moody College of Communication, which soon established an endowed chair of journalism in his honor.

Finally, he served as a member of the University of Texas Centennial Commission, which oversaw the 100th-anniversary celebration of the university&#x27;s founding in 1883.

== Death ==
Shivers died suddenly of a massive heart attack in Austin on January 14, 1985.

<doc id="971127" wikidata="Q1418082" url="?curid=971127" title="Ligretto">
<text>Ligretto is a card game for two to twelve players. The game in its current form was designed by Michael Michaels and published in 1988 by the German company Rosengarten Spiele. Since 2000 the game has been published by Schmidt-Spiele of Berlin, Germany. A blue version of the game has been published by Playroom Entertainment in North America and other English-speaking countries since 2009.

The objective of the game is to get rid of your cards faster than the other players by discarding them in the middle of the table. 

The game is based on and is similar to &quot;Dutch Blitz&quot;. Both card games use specially printed cards, but feature gameplay almost identical to &quot;Nerts&quot;, which is played with standard playing cards, and is in turn based on Canfield, a variant of the classic Klondike Solitaire. 

== History ==
Ligretto was first released in 1988 by the German company Rosengarten Spiele. It may have been inspired by Rasender Teufel, invented in 1927 in Leipzig, which had an almost identical set of rules and play style. It is also inspired by Dutch Blitz, which was invented to teach children about colors and numbers.

Good Time Holding bought the rights for the game in 1999, and since 2000 it has been published by the subsidiary Schmidt Spiele. Since its release, it has sold more than 4 million copies.

==Gameplay==
The game employs a unique deck of 160 cards. Each card features a face of red, green, yellow, or blue colour, and is numbered from 1 to 10. Every player receives 40 cards (ten of each colour), which possess a distinctive design on the reverse side, exclusive to that player.

=== Setup ===
Each player deals out their own deck by shuffling their cards and placing ten cards face up on the table to form a &quot;stack.&quot; The cards on the stack are face-up, with the numbers visible to the players. Additionally, three cards (four cards in a three-player game, five cards in a two-player game) are displayed face up next to this stack; these constitute the &quot;row&quot;, whose numbers are also visible to players. The remaining cards are held in each player&#x27;s hand.

=== Play ===
The game initiates when a player exclaims &quot;Ligretto!&quot; Then, players simultaneously discard cards onto the central table area. A legal card is any that is the next card in numerical order and in the same colour as the one currently in any pile, or a &#x27;1&#x27; card. New piles can only be initiated when a player acquires and plays a &#x27;1&#x27; card. A &#x27;1&#x27; card must be played from either the player&#x27;s row or their hand. A pile is complete when the &#x27;10&#x27; card is played on top, after which no cards can be played on that pile. 

If a player is unable to play any card, they must deal three cards from their hand and reveal only the top-most card. They must continue this until the revealed card can be played.

When one of the three cards from the Row is played, the void left behind is occupied by the top card from the Stack.

If no player can play another card, all participants reshuffle their hand, and a player proclaims &quot;Ligretto!&quot; to recommence the game.

The game completes when a player discards all cards from their stack pile and declares &quot;Ligretto stop!&quot;

==Scoring==
At the end of each round, all cards on the table are flipped over, returned to the players and tallied.

Each player gets one point for each card they played to the middle of the table, ignoring the number on the cards. Two points are then subtracted for each card remaining on their stack. Once the scores have been calculated, each player shuffles their set of 40 cards to start a new round. The player who declares &quot;Ligretto stop&quot; first is not necessarily the player who acquires the highest number of points.

The game continues until a player reaches a score of 99 points and wins. If more than one player scores 99 points in a round, the player with the highest points wins. 

==Game packs==
&quot;Ligretto&quot; comes in red, green, and blue packs. Each pack, containing cards for four players, has a different set of markings on the card backs. Having all three packs allows up to 12 players to play at a time.

<text>La Plume () was a French bi-monthly literary and artistic review. The magazine was set up in 1889 by Léon Deschamps, who edited it for ten years and was succeeded as editor by Karl Boès from 1899 to 1914. Its offices were at number 31 rue Bonaparte, Paris. From its beginning, famous artists such as Willette, Forain, Eugène Grasset, Toulouse-Lautrec, Maurice Denis, Mucha, Gauguin, Pissarro, Félicien Rops, Signac, Seurat, and Redon contributed to it. One of its most famous issues is that devoted to &quot;Le Chat noir&quot;. The magazine supported the symbolist art movement.

From 1903, &quot;La Plume&quot; sponsored weekly poetry events which included famous poets such as Max Jacob and Alfred Jarry. The magazine folded in 1914.

<text>Marcia Matilda Williams, Baroness Falkender, CBE (&quot;née&quot; Field; 10 March 1932 – 6 February 2019), also known as Marcia Falkender, was known as the private secretary for, and then the political secretary and head of political office to, UK Labour prime minister Harold Wilson.

==Background and early career==
Born Marcia Field in her parents&#x27; town of Long Buckby, there is an unconfirmed rumour that her mother was an illegitimate daughter of King Edward VII. Lady Falkender was educated at the independent selective Northampton High School and read for a BA in history at Queen Mary College, University of London. After graduating she became secretary to the general secretary of the Labour Party in 1955.

==In the service of Harold Wilson==
In 1956, Marcia Williams, as she was then known, became private secretary to Harold Wilson, Member of Parliament for Huyton, a position she retained until 1964, when she rose to be his political secretary and head of the political office in his position as leader of the Labour Party and as prime minister from 1964 until 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976. Falkender said that she first met Wilson when he offered her a lift when she was standing at a bus stop. Wilson&#x27;s press secretary Joe Haines said that the pair first met at a dinner with the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, at which Khrushchev and Labour MP George Brown had a drunken argument, which Williams took down in shorthand. Wilson reportedly drove her home after dinner. In 1970 she was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Questions were repeatedly raised in the press at the time about the propriety of her many commercial dealings; however, both Wilson and Williams successfully sued many London newspapers for libel. Later, Wilson publicly called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the press because of the defamation in the media, and that there had been a concerted smear campaign to de-stabilise his administration by MI5. These claims were partially corroborated by Peter Wright, former assistant director of MI5, in his book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, which was banned in the UK by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s administration until a 1988 court case overturned the ban.

Until 1966, the award of peerages was the prerogative of the chief whip, and not the prime minister. Wilson took that power to award peerages for himself, and later told his policy adviser Bernard Donoughue that he did it because &quot;that gal Marcia insisted on it&quot;. Donoughue&#x27;s diary recorded Wilson telling one of his staff that he had just quarrelled with Falkender, who was demanding &quot;peerages for friends&quot;. Donoughue&#x27;s diary actually credits the &quot;that gal Marcia insisted on it&quot; comment to Freddie Warren, who ran the Chief Whip&#x27;s office in No. 12 Downing Street from the mid-1950s until after Wilson resigned as prime minister in March 1976.

When Wilson resigned, Haines accused Falkender of writing the first draft of his Resignation Honours List on lavender paper, which Haines styled as the &quot;Lavender List&quot;. Haines was never asked to produce any evidence for this claim, and none was provided. Certainly, Wilson&#x27;s honours list included many businessmen and celebrities, along with Labour supporters. In a BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme aired on 14 February 1977, when asked to clarify his book, Haines explicitly and unequivocally denied any financial impropriety in the compilation of the list. 

Wilson&#x27;s choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation; former home secretary Roy Jenkins said that Wilson&#x27;s retirement &quot;was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party.&quot; In the 1990s, two large academic biographies of Wilson were published by Philip Ziegler and Ben Pimlott. Both authors asserted that there was no financial impropriety in the compilation of the list. Pimlott observed in his biography of Wilson that political secretaries often write down lists at the instructions of their employers, and that in this case the fact that the list was pink does not itself prove anything. Both Falkender and Wilson maintained that the list was Wilson&#x27;s. Falkender said it was compiled on Wilson&#x27;s last day in Downing Street: &quot;He put a pad in front of me of the pink paper that was stock paper back then and asked me to write out the names. My typewriter had been packed away so I wrote them down by hand. It really didn&#x27;t feel momentous.&quot;

She was elevated to the peerage as Baroness Falkender, of West Haddon in Northamptonshire, on 11 July 1974. Falkender had been her mother&#x27;s maiden name.

==After Downing Street==
In 1979, Falkender secretly began working with Gordon Reece and Lord McAlpine, two Conservative Party advisers who were close to Margaret Thatcher, to aid the party&#x27;s election to office. According to Charles Moore, Thatcher&#x27;s biographer, &quot;The purpose of the meetings was for Lady Falkender to convey to the Tory campaigners her assessment of what the Labour party was thinking.&quot; Under Thatcher&#x27;s leadership, the party won that year&#x27;s general election.

===House of Lords===
Although Falkender attended sittings in the House of Lords and voted, she never made a speech. She eventually became the longest serving Labour member of the House of Lords. She last voted in 2011.

Following her peerage, &quot;Private Eye&quot; often referred to her as &quot;Forkbender&quot;, an oblique reference to the contemporary activities of Israeli illusionist Uri Geller.

===Writings===
She wrote two books about her time in Downing Street: &quot;Inside Number 10&quot; on the period 1964–1970 and &quot;Downing Street in Perspective&quot; on Wilson&#x27;s third term as Prime Minister 1974–1976. After retiring from working in Downing Street, she worked as a columnist for the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; from 1983 to 1988. She continued to work for Wilson, handling his private business from the time of his resignation in 1976 until his death in 1995.

She was also one of the founder members of The Silver Trust, a charity which sponsored British silversmiths to provide a silver service for 10 Downing Street. Prior to The Silver Trust, Downing Street had no silverware of its own; it was provided on loan from other government offices.

===&quot;Yes Minister&quot;===
She was one of the sources inside Whitehall used by the writers of the comedy series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;, the other one being Lord Donoughue.

===Libel action against the BBC===
In 2001 Joe Haines re-wrote his original book, &quot;The Politics of Power&quot;, making allegations about Falkender. The BBC delayed the screening of a docudrama based on the book. After the programme (entitled &quot;The Lavender List&quot;) was aired on 1 March 2006, Falkender sued the BBC for libel, and was awarded £75,000. The BBC promised never to rebroadcast the programme.

==Personal life and death==
Marcia Field married George Edmund Charles Williams in 1955, but they divorced in 1961; she continued to be known as Marcia Williams in her professional life. Falkender had two sons in the late 1960s by the former political editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Walter Terry. When Wilson lost office in 1970, Falkender seized his papers, and her brother Tony Field helped Wilson break into her garage to recover them. On her brother&#x27;s wedding day, in 1973, his passport, airline tickets and money disappeared. Field called the police, who were told by Falkender that she had put them away for &quot;safe keeping&quot;.

In 1967, Wilson sued the pop group The Move for libel after the band&#x27;s manager Tony Secunda published a promotional postcard for the single &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot;, featuring a caricature depicting Wilson in bed with Falkender. Wilson won the case, and all royalties from the song were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of Wilson&#x27;s choosing.

Lady Falkender died on 6 February 2019, at the Newstead Lodge nursing home in Southam, Warwickshire, although news of her death was not reported until 16 February.
===2023 biography===

In October 2023, a biography of Falkender was published which suggested that she and Wilson had conducted an affair shortly after they met, which was over before he became prime minister. According to an unpublished memoir by Wilson&#x27;s election agent, George Caunt, the couple first met at a dinner at Labour&#x27;s headquarters in April 1956. Caunt wrote that after the dinner finished, Wilson introduced himself to Falkender. After this, Wilson offered her a lift in his car, &quot;and that night began an affair which was to last 5-6 years.&quot; Wilson always denied an affair, whilst Falkender dismissed the suggestion as a smear. McDougall&#x27;s book has many details about her political career and her private life, including amongst other things how the press held off from publicising matters such as the potentially career-destroying revelation that she had had two children out of wedlock, and how she hid her pregnancies from the 10 Downing Street personnel.

<doc id="971150" wikidata="Q583718" url="?curid=971150" title="Kirchberg, Luxembourg">
<text>Kirchberg (, ; ) is a quarter in north-eastern Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. It consists of a plateau overlooking the north-east of the historical city center, Ville Haute, connected to the rest of the elevated city by the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, which spans the Pfaffenthal valley. It is often referred to, in reference to the geographical feature it inhabits, as the Kirchberg plateau by Luxembourgish residents. Kirchberg is the predominant location of the European Union institutions and bodies based within Luxembourg, and is sometimes used as a metonym for the EU&#x27;s judiciary, which occupies the quarter. It is thus the central business district of Luxembourg.

== History ==

Although Kirchberg is first mentioned in historical records in 1222, one may assume there was an earlier settlement there, due to its useful location close to the Roman road from Reims to Trier. Little now remains of this &quot;Kiemwee&quot; (Roman road), but around 1900 it was still a popular walking destination for the city&#x27;s inhabitants. In that year, the historian Nicolas van Werveke declared in a speech: &quot;Who among us does not know the &quot;Kiem&quot; of Grünewald, [...] it is so well preserved on the whole stretch of the plateau, to the point where it leaves the forest, that one may boldly consider this part of the road one of the best-preserved of Gaul.&quot; Kirchberg, as well as Neudorf, belonged to the parish of Weimerskirch. As Neudorf did not have its own church for a long time, on Sundays its inhabitants had to climb the hill between them and Weimerskirch to get to the church there. So the &quot;Berg zur Kirche&quot; (&quot;hill to the church&quot;) became the &quot;Kirchberg&quot;, the church hill.

The isolated elevated position of the plateau made it an important defensive position and led to the 1732 construction of Forts Thüngen and Olizy in southeastern Kirchberg, as part of Luxembourg&#x27;s impressive fortifications. Its strategic importance was reaffirmed with several expansions to their battlements. However, much of Luxembourg&#x27;s fortifications were destroyed following the 1867 Treaty of London. In 1875, the Parish Church of Our Lady, Refuge of the Sick, was built to serve a small farming community that had established themselves in central Kirchberg.

Kirchberg remained largely undeveloped until the post-war period in the latter half of the 20th century, when its cheap land, and proximity to the city provided an attractive locality as the seat of various institutions of the European Communities - the forerunner to today&#x27;s European Union. The failure of the six founding states of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) to agree on a single basis for its institutions&#x27; location, had led to Luxembourg becoming its provisional seat upon the ECSC&#x27;s creation in 1952. However, with the development of the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, other cities had successfully bid for their institutions - noticeably Brussels and Strasbourg. Discussions leading up to the 1965 Merger Treaty, which merged the governing institutions of the three communities, focused on resolving the deadlock in finding a single basis for the three communities&#x27; institutions. The Luxembourg government, seeking to retain and further attract the communities&#x27; institutions, commissioned the construction of the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, spanning the Pffafenthal valley, to connect the Kirchberg plateau directly with Limpertsberg, and the rest of the elevated city, opening up its cheap land for development for the communities. The Luxembourg government&#x27;s efforts were successful and today Luxembourg is considered one of the EU&#x27;s three de facto capitals, retaining several institutions, most importantly, the Court of Justice of the European Union.

=== Contemporary developments ===
The development of the European district acted as a catalyst for the urbanisation of Kirchberg, promoted by the government initiative, the &quot;Fonds Kirchberg&quot;. The architecture of the Kirchberg plateau is notably modern.

The major components of Kirchberg&#x27;s urbanisation were drawn up by French architect Pierre Vago, with its central axis being the 3.5 km long Avenue John Fitzgerald Kennedy stretching from the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge in southwest Kirchberg to the edge of the Grünewald forest on the north-eastern border. The avenue was beautified from its original inception as an expressway into a tree-lined pedestrian-and-cycle-friendly thoroughfare, with separated tram and bus lanes. The Kirchberg campus of the University of Luxembourg is located midway along this avenue, in proximity to, since September 2019, the National Library of Luxembourg. A number of glass and steel edifices of commercial, and financial institutions spans from central to north eastern Kirchberg, where the Kirchberg Hospital is located.
Kirchberg has developed into an important cultural hub. The partially reconstructed Fort Thüngen, listed along with the rest of the former Fortress of Luxembourg, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, hosts the Mudam, a museum of modern art opened in 2006. Designed by I. M. Pei, it displays works by some of the world&#x27;s most notable modern artists. In close proximity, adjacent to one of the European Parliament&#x27;s original plenary chambers, is the Philharmonie, Luxembourg&#x27;s national concert hall. The grand auditorium seats over 1,500 people. On the eastern edge of the European district, Luxembourg&#x27;s National Sports and Culture Centre, d&#x27;Coque arena contains an Olympic-sized swimming pool and the country&#x27;s largest indoor arena with seating for 8,300 spectators.

In north-eastern Kirchberg, the mixed-use complex of the Kirchberg District Centre contains both the offices of the European Commission&#x27;s statistics body, Eurostat, and an Auchan hypermarket and shopping mall. Bordering the complex are the cinema multiplex, Kinepolis Kirchberg, and Luxembourg&#x27;s national exposition centre, LuxExpo The Box.

Today, south-western Kirchberg is dominated by the EU institutions and agencies that were the key to its development. This includes the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Auditors, parts of the European Commission, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, and the European Investment Bank. Additionally, the European School, Luxembourg I provides an education to the children of staff working within the EU bodies. Kirchberg&#x27;s association with the Court of Justice of the European Union, in particular, has led to it becoming a metonym for the institution.

, Kirchberg has a population of 10,725 inhabitants, with just under a quarter possessing Luxembourgish nationality.

== Public transport ==

Plans to provide Kirchberg with a more direct connection to national and international heavy rail links were realized in December 2017, with the opening of a funicular, on the southern edge of the plateau, in proximity to the European district, which provides access to a newly constructed station located in the bordering Pfaffenthal valley below. Connecting the funicular station, a new tram line was opened which, since July 2024, runs from its depot in northern Kirchberg, down Avenue J.F.K, across the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge, and on to the old town in Ville Haute, before terminating in the Cloche d&#x27;Or business district in the south of the city via, the central station.

In northern Kirchberg, between Luxexpo and the new tram depot, a major new transport hub with 10 bus platforms, a tram stop and a five-storey car park was completed in May 2022. The tram line&#x27;s extension from here to Luxembourg Airport is expected to be completed by early 2025.

The National Mobility Plan 2035 details a possible further tram extension in Kirchberg that would split from the existing line at Luxexpo, serving the Kiem and upcoming Laangfur urban development, as well as the CJEU, before rejoining the existing line via Boulevard Konrad Adenauer.

== Microclimate ==
Like Luxembourg City, Kirchberg has a general oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late spring. However, the slope and height of the area accounts for occasional lower temperatures (up to 1° below Luxembourg City), more frequent fog and enhanced precipitation of both rain and snow.

<doc id="971165" wikidata="Q14648106" url="?curid=971165" title="The Destroyer (novel series)">
<text>The Destroyer is a series of paperback novels about a U.S. government operative named Remo Williams, originally by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir. The first novel was published in 1971, although the manuscript was completed on June 25, 1963. Over 150 novels have been published. The main characters were adapted to film in &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot; (1985).

==Authors==
The series was initially co-authored by Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir, with each writing a portion of each book separately. In the late 1970s, the relationship between the two became tense, and Sapir withdrew. In the early 1980s, Murphy began using ghostwriters to help with the series, among them his wife Molly Cochran. In the mid-1980s, Sapir returned to participating in the series.

In the late 1980s, Will Murray took over the sole responsibility of writing the series with #74, having written several previous books with Murphy (and one with Cochran). After Sapir&#x27;s death, Murray continued the series until the late 1990s. When Murray left after novel #107, three novels were written by interim ghostwriters (#108 &amp; #110 by Mike Newton; #109 by Alan Philipson). Jim Mullaney took over for novels #111-#131, followed by two more by Newton. Tim Somheil was ghostwriter from #134 through #145. Marvel Comics writer Doug Murray wrote two related novels in the series, both involving the Destroyer&#x27;s battle with a werewolf.

The last Gold Eagle Publishing book, &quot;Dragon Bones&quot;, was released in October 2006. On July 11, 2006, it was announced that &quot;The Destroyer&quot; would be moving to Tor Books. Somheil was replaced by Mullaney, who co-wrote the new novels with Warren Murphy. The first Tor novel, &quot;The New Destroyer: Guardian Angel&quot;, was published in May 2007, accompanied by a re-release of three older novels collected as &quot;The Best of the Destroyer&quot;. There were a total of four (4) novels in 2007-2008 (#s 146-149), listing Murphy &amp; Mullaney as authors. &#x27;The End of the World&#x27; (#150) did not come out until 2013 and lists Murphy as sole author; this book and many reprints marked the start of Destroyer Books as the franchise&#x27;s own publication company. The last three books (so far), cover the period of 2016-2019 and listed Murphy and R.J. Carter as authors.

In 2002 Murphy started his own publishing house, Ballybunion, as a vehicle for &quot;Destroyer&quot; spin-off books. Ballybunion, now known as &quot;Destroyer Books&quot;, has reprinted &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, as well as the original works &quot;Destroyer World: The Assassin&#x27;s Handbook II &quot;, &quot;Destroyer World: The Movie That Never Was&quot; (a screenplay he and Richard Sapir wrote for a &quot;Destroyer&quot; movie that was never optioned), &quot;The Way of the Assassin&quot; (the wisdom of Chiun), and &quot;New Blood&quot;, a collection of short stories written by fans of the series.

In 2011 the rights to most of &quot;The Destroyer&quot; novels reverted to Warren Murphy. They are being released as e-books. Murphy is also reissuing many of the older titles in print format.

In 2017 Gene Donovan Press began publishing new books in the series (starting with &quot;Bully Pulpit&quot;) written by author R.J. Carter. #151 and #152 show a writing credit of &quot;Warren Murphy with R.J. Carter&quot; while #153 shows &quot;R.J. Carter with Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir&quot;.

In 2024, Bold Venture Press published a new anthology produced under license from Warren Murphy Media, LLC. &quot;Remo Williams, The Destroyer: The Adventures Continue&quot; features 11 new stories by various authors (several of who were ghost writers for Warren Murphy, or previously considered as ghost writers). A twelfth story, &quot;Terminal Philosophy&quot; by Warren Murphy and Will Murray, was originally published in &quot;All-Star Action Heroes&quot; #1 (Starlog Group, 1989), and previously unreprinted.

==Description==
The series&#x27; hero is Remo Williams, a Newark cop framed for a crime and sentenced to death. His death is faked by the government so he can be trained as an assassin for CURE, a secret organization set up by President Kennedy to defend the country by working outside the law. The head of CURE is Harold W. Smith, a man selected by the President not only for his brilliant mind but also because of his integrity. Smith is a former law instructor at Yale and served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II.

Remo&#x27;s trainer and father figure is Chiun, a deadly assassin and the last Master of Sinanju. It has also emerged that Remo is the Avatar of Shiva, as prophesied in the legends of Sinanju. In 1985, a revision of &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Handbook&quot; was published as &quot;Inside Sinanju&quot;, a companion book to the series. This is narrated primarily in the first person, from Chiun&#x27;s perspective. It covers anecdotes as well as information on the various villains and history of the series.

The series&#x27; basic formula had taken shape by about the third book, but many elements have been introduced into later stories about the early days of Remo&#x27;s training. In the first book, the word Sinanju is not used at all to describe the martial arts that Chiun teaches Remo. Zen, karate, aikido and judo are used instead. Remo has many trainers for other aspects of being an undercover operative; he is taught to use different types of firearms, and trained in close-quarters assassination. He smokes tobacco, drinks alcohol, and eats red meat, all activities that would later prove harmful or impossible as his body was changed by the harsh Sinanju training regimen. Remo uses a gun to shoot somebody, although it is only to wound, and all his actual kills are hand-to-hand. He does make a conscious choice not to use weapons, after a fight in which he kills a man who had been pointing a gun at him. He realizes that Chiun never carried a gun and is over 70, whereas MacCleary, who had told him to always carry a gun, is dead. The retelling of Remo&#x27;s origin in the story &quot;The Day Remo Died&quot; in &quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Handbook&quot; and in &quot;The Destroyer&quot; #120-121 and #128 resolve later developments more fully with his origins. 
==Villains==
Remo and Chiun have encountered a number of colorful villains, both human and superhuman. Their foes have run the gamut of pulp fiction, from mobsters to mad scientists to satires of famous real people. Notable examples include:

* Mr. Gordons, a shapeshifting android created by NASA with limited emotional capabilities.
* Cartoonist Uncle Sam Beasley, revived from cryogenic sleep and armed with an animatronic eye and hand.
* Super-soldier Elizu Roote, a cyborg with electricity-based superpowers.
* Friend, an artificial intelligence dedicated to making as much money as possible.
* Nuihc (&quot;Chiun&quot; reversed) the Renegade, Chiun&#x27;s first pupil and nephew. Once trained, Nuihc deserted his duty of providing for the village of Sinanju to seek personal profit. This forced Chiun out of retirement to train Remo Williams.
* Jeremiah Purcell (a.k.a. the Dutchman), Nuihc&#x27;s protege and a strong psychic and pyrokinetic.
* Kali, the Hindu goddess who is linked to Remo.
* The Master, a Chinese vampire.
* Wu Ming Shi (a.k.a. Dr. Fu Manchu)
* Sagwa, the bodyguard and right-hand man of Wu Ming Shi, a pastiche of martial artist Bruce Lee
* Rasputin, an undead Russian monk.
* Dr. Judith White, a scientist specializing in genetic engineering who changed herself into a weretiger.
* The Krahsheevah, a Russian soldier with the ability to walk through walls and transmit his physical form by converting into energy and traveling on phone lines, as well as other unique powers.

Given Remo and Chiun&#x27;s talents as assassins, few of their enemies have survived their initial encounter with them, but some of the above have managed to escape and return in subsequent stories.

==Other media==

===Film===

In 1985, &quot;The Destroyer&quot; concept was adapted for the theatrical movie &quot;Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins&quot;, starring Fred Ward as Williams, Joel Grey as Chiun and Wilford Brimley as Harold W. Smith. The film shows the first meeting of Remo and Chiun, and centers on a corrupt weapons manufacturer who is selling guns to the US Army.

In 2014 Sony Pictures hired director Shane Black, a fan of the book series, to begin work on a script by Jim Uhls and &quot;The Destroyer&quot; series co-author James Mullaney. In a 2018 interview Black said the project was &quot;still very much in play&quot;, and he planned to work on the script with Fred Dekker and Jim Mullaney. He praised Mullaney&#x27;s books in the series as equal to those of Warren Murphy and Richard Sapir&#x27;s.

===Television===

In 1988, an American television pilot, &quot;Remo Williams&quot;, aired but did not lead to a series. It was a follow-up to the first movie incorporating footage from the movie in the opening credits. It starred Jeffrey Meek as Williams, Roddy McDowall as Chiun, and Stephen Elliott as Harold W. Smith and is loosely based on the novella &quot;The Day Remo Died&quot;. Set one year after the events of the feature film, the pilot episode (titled &quot;The Prophecy&quot;) was directed by Christian I. Nyby II and the teleplay written by Steven Hensley and J. Miyoko Hensley. The episode featured guest stars Carmen Argenziano, Judy Landers, and Andy Romano. Craig Safan, who scored the movie, returned to provide the music for the pilot; his score was later released by Intrada Records (paired with Safan&#x27;s score for the TV movie &quot;Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the U.S.S. Indianapolis&quot;).

The television pilot had not been seen since 1988 until the Encore cable television channel began airing it in the summer of 2009.

On December 8, 2022, it was announced that Gordon Smith will be adapting a TV series version of &quot;The Destroyer&quot; for Sony Pictures Television with Adrian Askarieh executive producing.

===Comic books===
There have been several &quot;Destroyer&quot; comic book and magazine series published by various companies including Marvel.

===Audio book===
Books 95–122 in the series were released in audiobook format by GraphicAudio.

Books 3, 12 and 19 in the series were also released in audiobook format. These were produced by Speaking Volumes, LLC.

Assassin&#x27;s Playoff was published by Speaking Volumes (), number 20 in the list of audiobook format. Not sure if the three book numbers are incorrect or if there was a fourth release.

*&quot;The Assassin&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1983) features a novella &quot;The Day Remo Died&quot;. It was republished in 1985 as &quot;Inside Sinanju&quot;.
*&quot;Remo: The Adventure Begins...&quot; (1985): a novelization of the script by Christopher Wood 
*&quot;Destroyer World: New Blood&quot; (originally published in 2005, republished on May 21, 2010): an anthology of Destroyer stories written by both Warren Murphy and fans alike.

*&quot;Remo Williams, The Destroyer: The Adventures Continue&quot; (November 1, 2024): another anthology.

In 2007, Tor Books published four books in the series; due to contractual issues, the titles were changed to &quot;The New Destroyer&quot;, although the characters were unchanged. The numbering also restarted, so the first book is called &quot;The New Destroyer #1&quot;, rather than &quot;Destroyer #146&quot;.

<doc id="971169" wikidata="Q5413125" url="?curid=971169" title="European School, Luxembourg I">
<text>The European School, Luxembourg I (ESL1) was the first of the European Schools. It was founded in October 1953 on the initiative of officials of the European Coal and Steel Community, with the support of the Community&#x27;s institutions and the government of Luxembourg. In April 1957, it formally became the first of the European Schools. Today it is located on the Kirchberg plateau in Luxembourg City.

== History ==
=== Boulevard de la Foire ===
Parents working for the European Coal and Steel Community established the school in 1953. It became necessary to establish a new school when many European children from varying language backgrounds appeared.

When the school was founded it was located on the premises of a former furniture shop in the Limpertsberg quarter of Luxembourg city. It initially had 72 students. The school later moved to Villa Lentz in Hollerich. In 1956 construction began on a new building, located on Boulevard de la Foire, just outside the city centre. The building was opened in 1957, on 11 December. This building today houses the language teaching centre of Luxembourg. The first students graduated in 1959; the graduating class was 23.

At a later date, the school moved to a new site on the Kirchberg plateau, another quarter of Luxembourg city. During the late 80s, the school re-used the building at Boulevard de la Foire, as an overflow school for three age groups of the primary school. Since the end of the 1990s, the old building at Boulevard de la Foire has no longer been used by the European School.

=== Kirchberg ===

The school progressively moved to Kirchberg in the 1990s. At the end of the 1990s, the grounds on Kirchberg were completely redesigned. Old buildings were demolished and new ones (e.g. a new primary school building, an extension of the secondary school building and a new theatre building) were built, though three blocks of the old Secondary school (the current A, B and C blocks) were left standing. T and L blocks were added due to high number of students. In 2012, the school relocated a large portion of students to a second European School of Luxembourg campus, situated in Mamer. 3 years after the separation, it was decided that only T block will be conserved, while L is due to be demolished.

In 2014 the Luxembourgish government signed an agreement for the European Schools to accept 100 more students in their English and French sections.

The school is due to be served by an extension of line T1 of the Luxembourg City tramway by 2027.

== Students ==
As of 1999 the secondary school cycles consisted of three main sections, English, French, and German, each having two classes of students (classes A and B), while the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Greek sections only had one class of students per year each. Some students from Scandinavian countries also made up the Danish, Swedish, and Finnish sections, the latter two having been the newest addition to the language sections, just opened in 1995, respectively 1999. Due to their few numbers the students studied their mother tongue under special arrangements, and they shared many other classes such as Philosophy, Geography, History, and Human Science within the sections of their second language, which could be either in English, French, or German.

Some foreign students were also admitted in very rare cases, from countries that were not in the European Union at that time, but whose parents were working in Luxembourg. These included nationals from Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Bosnia, who were integrated into other language sections.

In the late 90s, the study of religion in the school was a compulsory subject, but it adhered to the Catholic Church which is the majoritarian religion in Luxembourg. For this reason many students could not opt in, therefore the school introduced the study of Ethics to students of Christian Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, and other religions.

== Guinness World records ==
In 2002, as part of a special program called &quot;Science Week&quot; that was presented by several teachers of different sciences (physics, biology, and chemistry), Mr. John Watson who holds a Master of Science in Biology, had organized together with the school management and almost 3,000 of its pupils, a giant human DNA in an attempt to receive an entry in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. The DNA which is made up of four simple building blocks called nucleotides, identified by the letters A, T, C, and G, was made with the help of pupils from both primary and secondary school cycles who stepped out in the courtyard, forming two rows facing the opposite direction and extending their right arms towards each other, wearing colored paper cuffs on their forearms, which represented the four letters of the building blocks of the DNA; their left arms resting on the shoulders of the pupils in front of them.

The world record for the largest human DNA helix was held in 2013 by the Hacettepe University in Turkey, with 3,034 participants, and as of 2016 it is held by the students from the Medical University of Varna in Bulgaria, with 4,000 participants.

== Incident ==
In the mid 2000s, a false bomb alert caused the closure of the school&#x27;s premises in the early mornings before the start of the classes. An unprecedented police presence ensued in collaboration with a special forces unit of the Luxembourgish police arriving by helicopter with bomb-sniffing dogs to inspect students&#x27; lockers. RTL, Luxembourg&#x27;s main TV channel was also quick to arrive on the school grounds. Teachers from the school collaborated with the police in the first hour of their arrival to identify the perpetrator via a recording of his phone call.

The individual responsible for the incident was a student enrolled at the school. Shortly before his scheduled class, he used a payphone located in downtown Luxembourg to contact the school&#x27;s administrative office. His intention was to avoid taking an exam scheduled for that morning. When the school failed to close immediately in response to his call, he proceeded to contact a local police department to initiate the alarm. Subsequently, the student faced disciplinary consequences, including at least a few years of expulsion from the school.

Among the students, there was widespread criticism about how the Luxembourgish police managed the emergency situation by landing a police helicopter on a basketball court, which was seen as reckless, given that primary school pupils were still actively playing in the area.

A fictionalized account of the event takes place in the 2024 novel &quot;Into Babel&quot; by James Leader, a former teacher at the school.

<doc id="971173" wikidata="Q820552" url="?curid=971173" title="Leftism (album)">
<text>Leftism is the debut studio album by English electronic music duo Leftfield, released in 1995 on Columbia Records. It contained a mixture of new tracks along with reworked versions of previous Leftfield singles. The album contains guest spots from musicians not associated with dance music at the time such as John Lydon from Public Image Ltd. (and formerly of Sex Pistols) and Toni Halliday from Curve. The album was described as progressive house, although some journalists found that label too limiting, suggesting the album incorporated many genres. After completing the album, the duo initially were not pleased with it.

On its release, the album was well received from the British press with positive reviews from the &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1995 but lost to Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;. &quot;Leftism&quot; sold well and was released months later in the United States. Critics have praised the album as one of the major album-length works of dance music, with &quot;Q&quot; referring to it as &quot;the first truly complete album experience to be created by house musicians and the first quintessentially British one&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Leftism&quot; is an album that consists of singles recorded previously by members Paul Daley and Neil Barnes between 1992 and 1995, with the exception of the single &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; which is not included, and other new tracks. These earlier singles included &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;, &quot;Song of Life&quot;, and &quot;Open Up&quot;. Some of these singles were remade and changed drastically from their original versions for &quot;Leftism&quot;. Barnes stated that &quot;rethinking and re-recording a few of our older tracks put us on the right road.&quot;

Barnes chose the guest vocalists who were not associated with dance music, as he &quot;love[s] taking people with nothing to do with dance music, like Toni, or Danny Red, and putting them in a different environment, It&#x27;s getting back to the original ethic of remixing, taking anything and turning it into dance music.&quot; Barnes was a fan of the group Curve, and had lead singer Toni Halliday come in and work on the song &quot;Original&quot;. &quot;Open Up&quot; features John Lydon on vocals. Neil Barnes stated he had known Lydon since he was 19 years old through a mutual friend. Leftfield wanted to do a track with Lydon for about two years but were held up as &quot;it took all that time to get him to commit to doing it and to get the track good enough.&quot; Two reggae vocalists are featured on the album; Danny Red on &quot;Inspection&quot; and Earl Sixteen on &quot;Release the Pressure&quot;. Lemn Sissay guests on &quot;21st Century Poem&quot;.

After completing the production on &quot;Leftism&quot;, Rob Daley was unhappy with how the album turned out stating that &quot;It sounded shit [...] It seemed to have no cohesion, the tracks just didn&#x27;t seem to hang well together. But having lived with it for a while it sounds much better.&quot; Paul Daley echoed these statements saying &quot;We did all the tracks, listened to them and decided it sounded a fucking mess [...] we went back, messed around with the running order and chopped a lot of things out. Hopefully now it sounds complete, something that can be listened to in one go.&quot;

==Style==
John Bush of the online music database AllMusic stated the album is not simply a progressive house album and that it &quot;spans a wide range of influences (tribal, dub, trance)&quot;. &quot;Clash&quot; expanded on this, describing &quot;Release the Pressure&quot; and &quot;Inspection (Check One)&quot; as dub-influenced tracks, while &quot;Storm 3000&quot; is a bass-heavy track that includes jungle rhythms. &quot;Q&quot; described &quot;Original&quot; as a &quot;sultry rock / electro fusion&quot; A review in Slant Magazine commented that &quot;&quot;Leftism&quot; eschews mainstream categorization and manages to reside in the leftfield of almost all the electronic genres it propagates&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Leftism&quot; was released on 30 January 1995 in the United Kingdom by Columbia Records. In the United States, it was released on 15 August. The single &quot;Open Up&quot; peaked at number 13 on the UK singles charts. &quot;Afro-Left&quot; peaked at number 20 on the US Club Play Singles chart in 1995. &quot;Leftism&quot; sold over 220,000 copies.

On 5 May 2017, the band released &quot;Leftism 22&quot;, with a remastered album as well a bonus disc of remixes by current artists, including Adrian Sherwood.

==Reception==

&quot;Leftism&quot; was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1995, but lost to Portishead&#x27;s &quot;Dummy&quot;. &quot;Mixmag&quot; praised the singles for &quot;Leftism&quot;, stating that &quot;classics like &#x27;Release The Pressure&#x27; and &#x27;Song of Life&#x27; were the cement that welded a whole new British house scene together. London proudly joined the league of house capitals. British dance music has never looked back.&quot; The &quot;NME&quot; praised the album as helping keep British house music alive &quot;when the boffins were getting complacent, the junglists were lining their pockets and the trip-hoppers were muscling in, Leftfield have returned to save the night.&quot; The &quot;NME&quot; gave the album a nine out of ten, declaring that &quot;there&#x27;s a scope and spirit, an energy and a madness to &#x27;Leftism&#x27; which&#x27;ll make it one of the few dance derived that&#x27;ll stay up there, bouncing around in the great echo chamber of futurity for years.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; awarded the album four stars out of five, stating that &quot;Leftfield unleash some of the most thumping techno to be housed under a major label&quot; and &quot;On this evidence, Leftfield join Underworld, The Prodigy and Orbital as dance acts to prove themselves across an album.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Paul Cooper, however, was dismissive of &quot;Leftism&quot;. In his 1999 review of the duo&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Rhythm and Stealth&quot;, he stated that when &quot;Leftism&quot; was released &quot;few could honestly say it was worth the wait&quot; and &quot;Had &#x27;Open Up&#x27; and &#x27;Release the Pressure&#x27; not been included in its track listing, it seems unlikely that anyone would be talking about Leftfield nowadays.&quot;

==Legacy==
Later reviews of the album were generally positive. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; gave a re-issue of the album four stars out of five, opining that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to overestimate the significance of &quot;Leftism&quot;, roundly acknowledged upon its release in 1995 as the first truly complete album experience to be created by house musicians and the first quintessentially British one.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; specifically praised the song &quot;Open Up&quot;, describing it as having a &quot;revolutionary fervour that once gripped dance, and that&#x27;s missing from pretty much all pop music at the moment.&quot; In 2010, &quot;Clash&quot; praised the album, finding that it &quot;remains a landmark in dance music. Perhaps the first successful, fully formed album from the genre, which remains a classic of the era and inspiration for many who followed.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; referred to the album positively in 1999, stating that &quot;Leftism&quot; is &quot;regarded as a classic and highly influential dance album, its gleeful risk-taking and lovingly honed production certainly setting a standard for electronic music producers to aim for&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 59 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the album in their list of &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Asit Krishna Mukherji (1898 – 21 March 1977) was an Indian writer with Nazi convictions who published pro-Axis journals. He married Savitri Devi in 1940 in order to protect her from deportation or internment.

==Biography==
Asit Krishna attended the University of London taking a doctorate in history. After graduating, he traveled in the Soviet Union. Unimpressed with Marxist materialism, he turned down several offers to work for communist newspapers back in India. He began, instead, to publish &quot;The New Mercury&quot; in collaboration with Sri Vinaya Datta. Proclaiming its support for Nazi Germany and Aryan racism, it expressed admiration for the race laws and Hellenic ideals. &quot;The New Mercury&quot; was published with the support of the German consulate in Calcutta. In January 1938, Asit Krishna met Savitri Devi, who was deeply impressed with his knowledge of Nazism. They married on 9 June 1940, in Calcutta.

After &quot;The New Mercury&quot; was closed down by the British government in 1937, he published &quot;The Eastern Economist&quot; in collaboration with the Japanese legation from 1938 to 1941.

Asit Krishna used his connections with Subhas Chandra Bose and the Japanese authorities to put them in contact with one another, thus facilitating the formation of the Indian National Army.

After the war, he made his living as a fortunetelling astrologer and had Savitri&#x27;s books printed.

<doc id="971184" wikidata="Q3842372" url="?curid=971184" title="Madman (Mike Allred character)">
<text>Madman is a creator-owned fictional superhero that appears in comic books by creator Mike Allred and which has been published by a number of publishers over the years. The character first appeared in &quot;Creatures of the Id&quot; #1 (Oct. 1990). His name, Frank Einstein, is a combination of Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein, and is also a reference to Frankenstein.

==Fictional character biography==
Frank Einstein was born Zane Townsend, an agent of the Tri-Eye Agency. Townsend was killed in a car accident, then stitched back together and brought to life by two scientists, Dr. Egon Boiffard and Dr. Gillespie Flem. This resurrection left him amnesic, and the resurrected John Doe was named after Boiffard&#x27;s artistic and scientific heroes, Frank Sinatra and Albert Einstein, respectively. The procedure left Frank with amplified physical capabilities with superhuman agility and reflexes and a slight degree of precognitive and empathic power; however, he remembers nothing about his former life, but faint, troubling memories relating to his death. Madman&#x27;s costume is based on the only thing he can clearly remember: a fascination with a comic book character called Mr. Excitement.

Frank Einstein now lives as a jack-of-all-trades wanderer, accompanied by a variety of allies, including the Atomics. Only one of Frank&#x27;s reanimators, Dr. Flem, is still in Frank&#x27;s life. Dr. Boiffard, in an attempt to boost his brain power, transmuted his entire head into neural tissue, leaving him an invalid in a hospital. Later, Boiffard became a cosmic being. Despite the fact Frank has blue skin, a metal scalp plate, and criss-crossed scars similar to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, he has a steady girlfriend, a secretary by the name of Josephine &quot;Joe&quot; Lombard. Madman&#x27;s other allies include Mott, an alien from the planet Hoople, who was saved by Frank when another alien, Zenelle, wanted to marry and eat Mott; Gale, an invisible female scientist who was tattooed by Dr. Flem&#x27;s mutant clones and further rendered invisible by her attempts to eliminate the tattoos; and Astroman and Machina, a pair of robotic humanoids. Astroman was built to be an aid to Frank and was loaded with some of Frank&#x27;s lost information. Astroman grew to love Frank&#x27;s girlfriend, Joe, which made Machina very jealous. Frank&#x27;s also aided by Marie and Warren, two artificial intelligences from the future.

Due to a plot by the mischievous Mister Mxyzptlk, Madman and Superman switched dimensions, becoming physical hybrids of each other. They then had to retrieve portions of Superman&#x27;s powers, which had been doled out amongst various people across both worlds. Finally, the two confronted Mister Mxyzptlk, and Madman defeated him in a game of Twister before tricking him into saying his name backwards.

Currently, Joe had been fused with Luna (It Girl) and has recently been &quot;pulled&quot; from her body. Frank has met with ghosts and learned more about his previous life, including great insights to the ways of the universe. After Frank is told of Joe being pulled from Luna, he rushes back to Dr. Flem&#x27;s laboratory, but finds that Mr. Monstadt has returned in a new, artificial body which is powerful enough to defeat him, most of the Atomics, and Joe, who was going to surprise Frank by becoming Madgirl. Immediately after the defeat of Monstadt, a fallen Atomic is revived and the team celebrates by going on a camping trip.

Madman has a cameo appearance in &quot;Invincible&quot; #60 (2009), appearing alongside other heroes from the Image Universe during &quot;The Invincible War&quot;.

===The Atomics===

Former enemies, now allies, are the Mutant Street Beatniks, who were originally just ordinary beatniks. When Mott first arrived he was being chased by Zenelle, a female alien from a species infamous throughout the galaxy for devouring their mates after the wedding night. Zenelle left behind a trail of spores as she tracked Mott through the city, exposure to which caused the beatniks to mutate into disgusting, warty versions of themselves. Zenelle fell in love with one of these mutants and carried him away, much to the relief of Mott.

Blaming Madman for their deformity, the Mutant Street Beatniks remained bitter enemies until they discovered that their deformation was simply the first stage of their mutation, which later gave them super powers. Discovering these powers cleared up their skin condition, they no longer hate Madman and have formed a superhero team, calling themselves the Atomics. Around this time, their missing comrade returned from space, revealing that Zenelle had actually fallen in love with him to the degree she went against her culture and refused to eat him. Because of the different time-flow between Snap City and Zenelle&#x27;s planet, when their comrade returned he brought with him his teenage son, the product of his union with Zenelle.

===Antagonists===
One of Madman&#x27;s primary enemies is Mr. Monstadt, his former employer (or so it is hinted). Madman has also fought runaway renegade robots from Dr. Flem&#x27;s lab who were controlled by the mysterious and super-intelligent Factor Max. Other antagonists include the Mutant Street Beatniks, the Moonboys, the Puke, the G-Men from Hell, Mattress, and Crept. However, the G-Men are occasional allies, and several of the Mutant Street Beatniks become allies as well. Frank has also faced generic monsters a number of times.

==Powers and abilities==
Frank&#x27;s resurrection altered his body, giving him various supernatural abilities. He possesses a supernatural intuitive talent for learning, allowing him to instinctively learn any skill and gain knowledge at a superhuman rate. He has amplified physical capabilities such as strength, flexibility and speed. His agility and reflexes are superhuman. His tendons and connective tissues are more elastic and his nerve endings transfer stimuli faster. He can even dodge shots at close range.

Frank has also manifested numerous psionic abilities that border on the supernatural, including the power to obtain information about an individual by making physical contact, empathy, and clairvoyance. He is also able to perceive the future, sometimes manifesting in vague dreams while asleep, other times displayed in clear thought, and sometimes occurring at will. Unfortunately, he does not have complete control over his psionic abilities.

===Film adaptation===

In 1998, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez obtained the film rights to &quot;Madman&quot;. He maintained collaboration with Allred throughout the on-and-off preproduction. In a 2000 interview, Allred mentioned that he had been in contact with Robin Williams for the role of Dr. Flem. Remarks from Rodriguez and Allred about finalizing the script and moving to casting and filming were made as late as 2010, though full production on the film never commenced.

In 2015, Allred indicated on Twitter that the rights to &quot;Madman&quot; had reverted to him, and in September 2019 has stated that he prefers to focus on comics rather than film or television adaptations for the time being.

===View Askewniverse appearances===
Allred did the artwork for the fictional &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot; comic in the film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; (in which he appears in a cameo as himself). The pages were collected as part of the film&#x27;s published screenplay, and Madman can be seen in one panel beneath the light of the &quot;blunt signal.&quot; In the &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; DVD commentary, Ben Affleck and Kevin Smith state that in one take the character can be seen reading &quot;Madman&quot;, and that in more than one take Ben Affleck describes &quot;Madman&quot; as &quot;a classy book.&quot; In Smith&#x27;s &quot;Dogma&quot;, a Madman action figure can be seen on the shelf of a toy store aisle.

===Action figure===
Madman&#x27;s first action figure was released in 1998 in the &quot;Big Blast&quot; toy line from Graphitti Designs. The figure came in classic white with a red lightning bolt, as well as a black-suited variant with yellow accents and lightning bolt. Wizard Entertainment offered a variant of the Madman Big Blast toy without his traditional mask, showing Frank&#x27;s face. Other toys in the line included Matt Wagner&#x27;s first Grendel (Hunter Rose), Kevin Matchstick from &quot;Mage&quot;, and Christine Spar as Grendel. Madman appears as part of the first wave of the Legendary Comic Book Heroes action figure series in 2007, along with Judge Dredd, Savage Dragon, and Sara Pezzini of &quot;Witchblade&quot;. In 2014, a Madman figure was released through an Amazing Heroes Kickstarter campaign.

<text>John Peters Ringo (May 3, 1850 – July 13, 1882) was an American Old West outlaw loosely associated with the Cochise County Cowboys in frontier boomtown Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He took part in the Mason County War in Texas during which he committed his first murder. He was arrested and charged with murder. He was affiliated with Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton, and Frank Stilwell during 1881–1882. He got into a confrontation in Tombstone with Doc Holliday and was suspected by Wyatt Earp of having taken part in the attempted murder of Virgil Earp and the ambush and death of Morgan Earp. Ringo was found dead with a bullet wound to his temple which was ruled a suicide. Modern writers have advanced various theories attributing his death to Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Frank Leslie or Michael O&#x27;Rourke.

== Early life ==

Johnny Ringo, son of Martin and Mary Peters Ringo, had distant Dutch ancestry, and was born in what later became the small town of Greens Fork, Clay Township, Wayne County, Indiana. His family moved to Liberty, Missouri, in 1856. He was a tangentially related cousin to the Younger brothers through his aunt Augusta Peters Inskip, who married Coleman P. Younger, uncle of the outlaws.

In 1858, his family moved from Liberty to Gallatin, where they rented property from the father of John W. Sheets, who became the first &quot;official&quot; victim of the James–Younger Gang when they robbed the Daviess County Savings &amp; Loan Association in 1869.

On July 30, 1864, when Johnny was 14, his family was in Wyoming en route to California. His father, Martin Ringo, was killed when he stepped off their wagon holding a shotgun, which accidentally discharged. The family buried Martin on a hillside alongside the trail.

== Mason County War ==

Ringo left his mother, brother, and sisters in San Jose, California, in 1869 and moved to Mason County, Texas. He befriended an ex-Texas Ranger Scott Cooley who was the adopted son of rancher Tim Williamson.

Trouble started when two American rustlers, Elijah and Pete Backus, were dragged from the Mason jail and lynched by a predominantly German mob. Full-blown war began on May 13, 1875, when Tim Williamson was arrested by a hostile posse and murdered by a German farmer named Peter &quot;Bad Man&quot; Bader. Cooley and his friends, including Johnny Ringo, conducted a terror campaign against their rivals. Officials called it the &quot;Mason County War&quot;; locally it was called the &quot;Hoodoo War&quot;. Cooley retaliated by killing local German ex-deputy sheriff John Worley, then taking his scalp and tossing his body down a well on August 10, 1875.

Cooley already had a reputation as a dangerous man and was respected as a Texas Ranger. He killed several others during the &quot;war&quot;. After Cooley supporter Moses Baird was killed, Ringo murdered James Cheyney on September 25, 1875, with a friend named Bill Williams. They rode up to Cheyney&#x27;s house. Cheyney (who had led Baird into the ambush) greeted them unarmed, invited them in, and began washing his face on the porch. Both Ringo and Williams shot and killed him. The two then rode to the house of Dave Doole and called him outside, but he came out with a gun and they fled back into town.

Some time later, Scott Cooley and Johnny Ringo mistook Charley Bader for his brother Pete and killed him. Both men were jailed in Burnet, Texas by Sheriff A. J. Strickland, but Ringo and Cooley soon broke out of jail with help of their friends and they parted company to evade the law.

The Mason County War ended in about November 1876 after about a dozen individuals had been killed. Scott Cooley was thought to be dead and Johnny Ringo and his friend George Gladden were in jail. One of Ringo&#x27;s alleged cellmates was the notorious killer John Wesley Hardin. While Gladden was sentenced to 99 years, Ringo appears to have been acquitted. Two years later, Ringo was a constable in Loyal Valley, Texas. Soon after this, he traveled to Arizona.

== Life in Tombstone ==

Ringo first appeared in Cochise County, Arizona Territory in 1879 with Joseph Graves Olney (alias &quot;Joe Hill&quot;), a friend from the Mason County War. In December 1879, a drunk Ringo shot unarmed Louis Hancock in a Safford, Arizona saloon when Hancock refused a complimentary drink of whiskey, stating that he preferred beer. Hancock survived his wound. Soon after arriving in Tombstone, Arizona, he met editor Sam Purdy of &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot;, who later writes of their talk: &quot;He said that he was as certain of being killed as he was of living then. He said that he might run along for a couple years more, and may not last two days.&quot; In Tombstone, Ringo developed a reputation as having a bad temper. He may have participated in robberies and killings with the Cochise County Cowboys, a loosely associated group of outlaws. He was occasionally erroneously referred to as &quot;Ringgold&quot; by local newspapers. He described himself as a &quot;speculator&quot; in the 1882 Cochise County Great Register.

=== Confrontation with Doc Holliday ===

On January 17, 1882, Ringo and Doc Holliday traded threats and seemed headed for a gunfight. Both men were arrested by Tombstone&#x27;s chief of police, James Flynn, and hauled before a judge for carrying weapons in town. Both were fined. Judge William H. Stilwell followed up on charges outstanding against Ringo for a robbery in Galeyville and Ringo was re-arrested and jailed on January 20 for the weekend. Ringo was suspected by the Earps of taking part in the December 28, 1881, ambush of Virgil Earp, that crippled him for life, and the March 18, 1882, murder of Morgan Earp while he was shooting pool in a Tombstone saloon.

=== Joins posse pursuing Earps ===

Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and his posse killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson on March 20, 1882. After the shooting, the Earps and a federal posse set out on a vendetta to find and kill the others they held responsible for ambushing Virgil and Morgan. Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan received warrants from a Tucson judge for arrest of the Earps and Holliday. He deputized Ringo and 19 other men, many of them friends of Stilwell and the Cochise County Cowboys.

During the Earp Vendetta Ride, Wyatt Earp killed one of Ringo&#x27;s closest friends, &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius, in a gunfight at Iron Springs (later Mescal Springs) about from Tombstone. Earp told his biographer, Stuart Lake, that a man named Florentino Cruz confessed to being the lookout at Morgan&#x27;s murder and identified Ringo, Stilwell, Swilling, and Brocius as Morgan&#x27;s killers, 
The local posse pursued and came close to the federal posse at Henry C. Hooker&#x27;s ranch, but never faced the Earp lawmen. Former Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul, who had been in Tombstone at the time and volunteered to ride with the Behan posse, wrote a letter to the &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; on March 3, 1898 in response to an earlier story he said was full of errors. He said the Earp posse had told Hooker to tell Behan and his posse where they were camped. Hooker told Behan where the Earps were camped but the posse left in the opposite direction.

== Death ==

During Tombstone&#x27;s Fourth of July festivities, Ringo drank heavily. He left town two days later, taking several bottles of liquor for the ride. Deputy Billy Breakenridge saw him two days later near Dial&#x27;s Ranch in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains. He later wrote that &quot;Ringo was very drunk, reeling in the saddle.&quot; He encouraged Ringo to follow him back to the Goodrich Ranch, but &quot;he was drunk and stubborn and went on his way. I think this was the last time he was seen alive.&quot; At about 3pm on July 13, ranch hands at a nearby ranch heard a shot.

=== Suicide ===

Teamster James Yoast was hauling wood when he found Ringo&#x27;s body on July 14 seated in &quot;a bunch of five large black jack oaks growing up in a semicircle from one root, and in the center of them was a large flat rock which made a comfortable seat.&quot; He was &quot;not more than 700 feet from Smith&#x27;s house&quot; in West Turkey Creek Valley, near Chiricahua Peak in Arizona Territory. His body had already turned black from the desert heat.

His feet were wrapped in strips of cloth torn from his undershirt. Ringo had lost his horse with his boots tied to the saddle. The coroner&#x27;s report noted that &quot;He had evidently traveled but a short distance in this foot gear.&quot; There was a bullet hole in his right temple and an exit wound at the back of his head. The fatal wound was upward at a 45-degree angle between the right eye and ear. His revolver was still in his right hand.

According to the coroner&#x27;s report, Ringo&#x27;s Colt Single Action Army .45 revolver held five cartridges. A knife cut was found at the base of his scalp, as if &quot;someone had cut it with a knife.&quot; His horse was found eleven days later about away with Ringo&#x27;s boots still tied to the saddle. A coroner&#x27;s inquest officially ruled his death a suicide.

Ringo&#x27;s body is buried near the base of the tree where it was discovered. The grave is located on private land. A gate on a nearby road permits visitors to view the site. Despite the coroner&#x27;s ruling and contemporaneous newspaper reports that Ringo had &quot;frequently threatened to commit suicide, and that the event was expected at any time&quot;, alternative theories of doubtful plausibility about Ringo&#x27;s death have been proposed over the years. Some assert that the lack of powder burns on his head suggest he was shot from a distance. The coroner&#x27;s jury report does not mention the presence or absence of powder burns. Furthermore, Ringo&#x27;s body was already turning black due to decomposition.

Robert Boller, a member of the coroner&#x27;s jury, wrote in 1934, &quot;I showed [James Yoast] where the bullet had entered the tree on the left side. Blood and brains [were] oozing from the wound and matted his hair. There was an empty shell in the six-shooter and the hammer was on that. I called it a suicide fifty-two years ago, I am still calling it suicide. I guess I&#x27;m the last of the coroner&#x27;s jury.&quot;

=== Wyatt Earp claims ===

According to the book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, which author and collector Glen Boyer claimed to have assembled from manuscripts written by Earp&#x27;s third wife, Josephine Marcus Earp, Earp and Doc Holliday returned to Arizona with some friends in early July and found Ringo camped in West Turkey Creek Valley. As Ringo attempted to flee up the canyon, Earp shot him with a rifle. Boyer refused to produce his source manuscripts, and reporters wrote that his explanations were conflicting and not credible. &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Allen Barra wrote that &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; &quot;... is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax.&quot;

Tombstone historian Ben T. Traywick thought the story about Earp&#x27;s involvement was credible, reasoning that only Earp had sufficient motive, he was probably in the area at the time, and near the end of his life he told one historian &quot;in circumstantial detail how he killed John Ringo&quot;. Earp was interviewed in 1888 by an agent of California historian Hubert H. Bancroft, and in 1932, Frank Lockwood, who authored &quot;Pioneer Days in Arizona&quot;, wrote that Earp told both of them that he killed Ringo as he left Arizona in March 1882 – almost four months before Ringo died. He included other details that do not match what is known about Ringo&#x27;s death. Earp repeated his story to at least three other people. In an interview with a reporter in Denver in 1896, Earp denied that he had killed Ringo; but later, privately, claimed once again that he had.

=== Doc Holliday story ===

The Holliday theory is similar to the Earp theory, except that Holliday is alleged to have killed Ringo. A variant, popularized in the movie &quot;Tombstone&quot;, asserts that Holliday stepped in for Earp in response to a gunfight challenge from Ringo and shot him. Records of the Pueblo County, Colorado District Court indicate that Holliday and his attorney appeared in court on July 11, 14, and 18, 1882 to answer charges of &quot;larceny&quot;. However, a writ of capias was issued for him on the 11th, suggesting that he did not in fact appear in court on that date. Ringo&#x27;s body was found on the 14th. Six days before Ringo&#x27;s death, the &quot;Pueblo Daily Chieftain&quot; reported that Holliday was in Salida, Colorado, about from Turkey Creek, Arizona; and then in Leadville, about distant, on July 18. There was still an arrest warrant outstanding on Holliday in Arizona for his part in Frank Stilwell&#x27;s murder, making it unlikely that he would have entered Arizona at that time.

=== Michael O&#x27;Rourke theory ===

Some accounts attribute Ringo&#x27;s death to Michael O&#x27;Rourke, an itinerant gambler who was arrested in Tucson in January 1881 on suspicion of murdering a mining engineer named Henry Schneider. Wyatt Earp is said to have protected him from being lynched by a mob organized and led by Ringo. O&#x27;Rourke escaped from jail in April 1881 and never stood trial on the murder charges.

The last documented sighting of O&#x27;Rourke was in the Dragoon Mountains near Tombstone during May 1881, &quot;well-mounted and equipped&quot;, and presumably on his way out of the territory. From then on he is referred to only in unsubstantiated rumors and legends; according to one, a combination of the debt he owed Earp and the grudge he held against Ringo prompted him to return to Arizona in 1882, track Ringo down, and kill him. While some sources consider the story plausible, others point out that O&#x27;Rourke, like Holliday, would have been reluctant to re-enter Arizona with a murder warrant hanging over his head, particularly to commit another murder.

=== Frank Leslie claim ===

While in the Yuma Territorial Prison for killing his wife, Buckskin Frank Leslie reputedly confessed to a guard that he had killed Ringo. Few believed his story, and some thought he was simply claiming credit for it to curry favor with Earp&#x27;s inner circle, or for whatever notoriety it might bring him.

<text>Michael Turner (born 1962 in North Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian musician, and writer of poetry, prose and opera librettos. His writing is noted for including detailed and purposeful examination of ordinary things.

==Career==
Turner was an original member of the Vancouver band Hard Rock Miners, formed in 1987, singing and playing guitar and banjo. The band toured across Canada and released four albums of rockabilly music. His 1993 book &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; is about his experiences while fronting the band.

Turner wrote &quot;Company Town&quot; in 1991, and followed it with Hard Core Logo in 1993 and &quot;Kingsway&quot; in 1995. Turner employed multi-format and intertextual approaches in his works &quot;American Whiskey Bar&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Pornographer&#x27;s Poem&quot; (1999).

In 1996, Bruce McDonald directed a film based on &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;; he also directed a live telecast dramatizing Turner&#x27;s novel &quot;American Whiskey Bar&quot; in 1998, which Citytv produced and aired. That year he founded the literary/visual art imprint Advance Editions, with Arsenal Pulp Press. In 1998, he appeared as the dance MC and announcer in the short film &quot;Elimination Dance&quot;, directed by McDonald with Don McKellar and Michael Ondaatje.

Turner&#x27;s work was adapted to radio, stage, television and feature film, and he has been translated into French, German, Russian, and Korean. He won the Genie Award in 1996 for Music/Original Song, the 2000 Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize and was also a finalist for the 1992 Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize.

Turner collaborated with artist Stan Douglas on two experimental-video screenplays, titled &quot;Journey into Fear&quot; (Istanbul Biennial, 2001) and &quot;Suspiria&quot; (Documenta XI, 2002) and on a screenplay with filmmaker Bruce LaBruce, titled &quot;Untitled Von Gloeden Project&quot;, based on the life and work of photographer Wilhelm Von Gloeden. He was commissioned to write a libretto for the Modern Baroque Opera Company, based on Wilhelm Busch&#x27;s &quot;Max &amp; Moritz&quot;.

Turner lives in Vancouver, writes art essays and edits Advance Editions.

<text>Ali Parvin (; born 25 September 1947) is a retired Iranian football player and coach. He is among the most prominent Iranian footballers. He played for the Iran national football team. During his career, he played as an attacking midfielder or forward, and was associated mainly with Persepolis, playing for the team for eighteen years, managing the club on three occasions, for a combined total of for seventeen years, and also serving as the club&#x27;s president.

He was selected as one of the seventeen Asian football elites by AFC and received a statue from this confederation. He was named as one of the members of Persepolis Hall of Fame and the club thanked him for his great performance during his senior career at Persepolis. The club gave him a statue of his face and named him one of the twelve great players of Persepolis in the 1970s.

==Playing career==

===Club career===
He was discovered whilst playing street football with the neighborhood club &quot;Aref&quot;. After being scouted, he joined Alborz FC, the reserve team of &quot;Kayan FC&quot;, where he would be called up quickly. Eventually, he made his way to Paykan F.C. and was one of the star players in the team in its short run in Iranian football. He moved to Persepolis FC as many other Paykan players did after the club was dissolved in 1970. After the Iranian Revolution and during the Iran–Iraq War, Parvin was instrumental in helping the Persepolis club survive. By the end of his playing career, he operated in a player/manager position. He retired from competitive football in 1988.

===International career===

He played for the Iran national football team and was part of the Iranian Asian Cup winning squads of 1972 and 1976.

Parvin participated in the 1972 Munich Olympics and played in all three of Iran&#x27;s matches. He also participated at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, again playing in all three of Iran&#x27;s matches. He scored in the group game against Poland.

He retired from international football after Iran exited the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, accumulating 76 caps and 11 goals.

==Managerial career==
In late 1989 Parvin became the Iranian national team manager. He had already gained experience managing Tehran powerhouse Persepolis FC. At first his popularity grew even more as the team won the 1990 Asian Games football gold medal, but early elimination from the 1992 Asian Cup and failure to qualify for World Cup 1994 cost him his job. He was fired in 1993 and replaced by Stanko Poklepovic.

He later became the manager of Persepolis FC and helped the team to several league titles. He left the team briefly in the 2003–04 season but returned the year after as the technical director of the team. After a poor start for Persepolis in the 2005–06 season, he again became the manager, only to leave at the end of the season due to the club&#x27;s poor form.

<doc id="971207" wikidata="Q640073" url="?curid=971207" title="Ardrossan">
<text>Ardrossan (; ) is a town on the North Ayrshire coast in southwestern Scotland. The town has a population of 10,670 and forms part of a conurbation with Saltcoats and Stevenston known as the &#x27;Three Towns&#x27;. Ardrossan is located on the east shore of the Firth of Clyde.

The town is the main terminal of Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services operating from mainland Scotland to the Isle of Arran. 

==History==

Ardrossan&#x27;s roots can be traced to the construction of its castle &#x27;Cannon Hill&#x27;, thought to be in around 1140, by Simon de Morville. The castle and estate passed to the Barclay family (also known as Craig) and through successive heirs until the 14th century when it passed to the Eglinton family on the death of Godfrey Barclay de Ardrossan, who died without an heir. Sir Fergus Barclay, Baron of Ardrossan, was said to be in league with the Devil and in one of his dealings, set the task for the Devil to make ropes from sand; on failing to do so, the Devil kicked the castle with his hoof in frustration and left a petrosomatoglyph hoofprint.
The castle stood until 1648, when Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops had it destroyed, taking much of the stonework to Ayr to build the citadel at Montgomerieston. The ruins of &quot;Cromwell&#x27;s Fort&quot; still stand, but are overgrown and in a dangerous condition.

In 1759, The 10th Earl of Eglinton formed a herd of the ancient breed of White or Chillingham cattle at Ardrossan, probably using stock from the Cadzow herd. The numbers dropped and in 1820 the remaining animals were dispersed. All the animals in the herd were hornless.

Ardrossan developed during the 18th and 19th centuries thanks to its position on the coast. Exports of coal and pig iron to Europe and North America were the main trade from the town&#x27;s port, which became a centre for shipbuilding. Fishing vessels and small cargo boats were the mainstay of the shipyard until the 1950s, when the yard ceased to exist as a result of foreign competition. A smaller yard, McCrindle&#x27;s, operated until the 1980s before it ceased trading.

Passenger services from Ardrossan Harbour to Brodick on the Isle of Arran started in 1834, and services to Belfast, in Ulster in the north of Ireland, and to the Isle of Man followed in 1863 and 1892 respectively. Clyde sailings were operated initially by the Glasgow and South Western Railway Company from Winton Pier and the Caledonian Railway from Montgomerie Pier. The Earl of Eglinton&#x27;s ambitious plan for a canal link to Glasgow was never realised.

Between 1841 and 1848, Ardrossan was a part of the &quot;West Coast Main Line&quot; equivalent of its time. The fastest route from London to Glasgow was by train to , and then by packet boat to Ardrossan. After 1848 the entire journey could be made by rail, avoiding Ardrossan.
The link to the Isle of Man no longer operates, having first been moved to Stranraer until all Scottish services terminated. Shell-Mex operated an [oil refinery] on behalf of the Air Ministry, from a Second World War aviation-fuel canning factory, and the harbour was expanded for the company&#x27;s tanker ships to berth.
The harbour has been redeveloped as a marina, and the passenger and vehicle ferry to Brodick is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne.

Ardrossan became a burgh, in 1846, with a provost, magistrates and commissioners. After the Second World War, the burgh was based at Ardrossan Civic Centre. Its burgh status was lost in 1974 on the formation of Strathclyde Regional Council, when it came under Cunninghame District. It is now part of North Ayrshire, created as a unitary authority in 1996.
In 1921 Ardossan was the European site for the first successful reception of medium wave radio signals from North America. Using a wavelength of about 230 to 235 metres (a frequency near 1.3 Megahertz) an amateur radio group in Connecticut sent Morse code signals to a station set up in a tent.

==Transport==
===Railway===
The town has three railway stations: , close to the boundary with Saltcoats; , closed 1968 and reopened 1987; and near the port for the Arran ferry. Ardrossan South Beach station is at the junction on the Ayrshire Coast Line, where the lines to Ardrossan Harbour and diverge. There are two trains per hour that head eastbound from Ardrossan South Beach to , of which one comes from Ardrossan Harbour, calling at Ardrossan Town, and the other comes from Largs. All rail services from Ardrossan are operated by ScotRail.

There are two closed railway stations: Ardrossan North was adjacent to Montgomerie Street, and the platform remains can still be seen, although the redevelopment of the former Shell Bitumen Plant site edges closer to the remains. Ardrossan Montgomerie Pier was further down the line from Ardrossan North, but the building of the harbourside apartments removed the last remains of the platforms and no evidence remains that a railway station once stood there.
The last train ran through these stations around 1968, although by that time they served summer boat train services only, after regular passenger traffic ceased in 1932.

===Roads and bus services===
Ardrossan is linked to Glasgow via the A737 road and to Ayr via the A78 road. The A78 Three Towns Bypass opened in December 2004 and has provided an improvement to local transport links, reducing local travelling times. The bypass has diverted heavier traffic from the Three Towns. Bus services to the town are operated primarily by Stagecoach West Scotland.

===Ferry services===
A regular ferry service from Ardrossan to Brodick on the Isle of Arran has run since 1834. The ferry departs every two hours and 45 minutes Monday–Saturday and takes 55 minutes. A ferry service to Campbeltown started on 23 May 2013.

In February 2024, concerns were raised about the long-term future of ferry services from Ardrossan to Arran and Campbeltown following the permanent closure by Peel Ports of the Irish Berth at Ardrossan Harbour, which had been used as a secondary berth by Caledonian MacBrayne. The closure was condemned by CalMac chief executive Robbie Drummond and Arran residents.

In the past Ardrossan had ferry services to Belfast, and, in summer, to the Isle of Man. The Belfast run was operated by the Burns and Laird Line and its last scheduled service was in 1976. The last ship to sail the route was , which was the largest car ferry to operate from Ardrossan. The Isle of Man run was operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company during the summer season, and its last service was in 1985, however Caledonian MacBrayne experimented with a smaller vessel for a couple of seasons, which ran one return service per week.

==Education==
Ardrossan is served by three primary schools (St Peter&#x27;s Primary School, Stanley Primary School, and Winton Primary School) and two secondary schools: Ardrossan Academy, a non-denominational school opened in 1882, has about 1,050 students from Ardrossan, Saltcoats, West Kilbride and Seamill; St Matthews Academy in Saltcoats is the secondary school for Roman Catholic pupils from Ardrossan.

==Energy==

Ardrossan is located near two nuclear power stations: Hunterston A, 360 MW and Hunterston B, 1215 MW.

Ardrossan Wind Farm, a 24 MW wind farm that opened in 2004, overlooks the town.

==Places of worship==
In Ardrossan, there are five churches.

* St.Peter-in-Chains is a Roman Catholic church. Designed by Jack Coia and opened in 1938. Category A Listed building. The Stations of the Cross are by Archibald Dawson.
* Park Church is Church of Scotland. 
* EU Congregational Church
* Church of the Nazarene.

==Amenities ==
* Eglinton Country Park is linked to Ardrossan by the Sustrans Cyclepath.
* There is a Unionist Club on Princes Street, which was established in 1901 and a Labour Social Club is present in the neighbouring town of Saltcoats.
* The town has two diplomatic missions, a Danish and a Norwegian consulate.
* The town has a municipal cemetery, on Sorbie Road, which was opened in 1854. It contains the graves of 23 sailors who died in the sinking of &quot;HMS Dasher&quot;.

==Governance==
Ardrossan is in the Ayrshire North and Arran constituency in the House of Commons and Cunninghame North constituency in the Scottish Parliament. The Westminster seat is held by the Scottish National Party, and the Holyrood seat was gained by the Scottish National Party from Labour in the May 2007 election by a mere 48 votes.

Historically, Ardrossan has been part of the UK parliament constituencies North Ayrshire (1868–1918), Bute and Northern Ayrshire (1918–1983) and Cunninghame North (1983–2005). These constituencies historically returned Conservative or Unionist MPs until 1987, when the constituency was won by the Labour Party.

==Sport==
Ardrossan is home to a number of sports teams including Ardorssan Winton Rovers, an association football club which plays in the West of Scotland League, and North Ayrshire Table Tennis Club.

==Castlehill==
Castlehill is also known as &#x27;Cannon Hill&#x27; by locals. A historic ancient burial place on Castle Hill was vandalized in the 1950s. One tomb was then taken to the Barony Church on South Crescent for safekeeping.

A prehistoric shell-mound, measuring 102 ft by 16 ft, on the side of Cannon Hill, close to Ardrossan Town railway station, was excavated by the Ayrshire historian John Smith in the 1890s. Its length was mostly overhung by a few feet, by the rock face, which had formed a rock-shelter, which the excavation showed had been occupied at intervals over a considerable period. The railway workings had cut a longitudinal section in the mound, which overlay a 1 ft layer of raised beach sand.

The mound was composed of seashells, mainly periwinkle and limpet, and animal bones.
Relics found included a stone &#x27;anchor&#x27; with a groove cut round it for a rope, a possible stone sinker, fragments of very coarse, hammer stone, hand-made pottery, also pieces of wheel-turned, glazed pottery, a bone chisel, two bone needles, etc. No sign of the mound is visible today.

<text>Twisted is a 2004 American psychological thriller directed by Philip Kaufman, written by Sarah Thorp, and starring Ashley Judd, Samuel L. Jackson, and Andy García. The film is set in San Francisco.

==Plot==
Having solved a high-profile case involving serial killer Edmund Cutler that ended with her being taken hostage by Cutler but managing to overpower and arrest him, officer Jessica Shepard of the San Francisco Police Department is transferred to the homicide division and promoted to the rank of inspector. SFPD Commissioner John Mills, her foster father and her deceased father&#x27;s former partner, also serves as her proud mentor. Shepard is an alcoholic and nymphomaniac, carrying the emotional burden of her father murdering some of her mother&#x27;s extra-marital lovers, then Shepard&#x27;s mother and himself.

When one of Shepard&#x27;s former one-night stands is brutally murdered, Shepard and her new partner, Mike Delmarco, are assigned to the case. Shepard admits that she had slept with the victim yet remains assigned to the case. A few days later, another of Shepard&#x27;s numerous one-night stands is murdered and soon the police come to the conclusion that the killer is stalking Shepard. At Mills&#x27; insistence, Shepard remains on the case to bait out the killer.

As investigations progress, Shepard keeps having alcoholic blackouts at night, having already had them on the nights of the two murders. She confides this to Mills, who encourages her to carry on.

Shepard discovers a third murder, Cutler&#x27;s defense attorney Ray Porter, whom she also had previously had sex with, who had summoned her via note to meet him that morning. Inspector Dale Becker focuses the investigation on Shepard herself, due to Shepard&#x27;s fleeting sexual relationship with the victims and her occasional flashes of violent behaviour in the line of police duty. Shepard begins to fear that she is becoming like her father and committing similar murders, especially after a fourth of her former lovers is murdered, SFPD Officer Jimmy SchmidtShepard wakes up with Schmidt&#x27;s corpse in her bed. In each case, the murder seems to have been committed using a yawara. Shepard is skilled in delivering blows with a yawara, so she is arrested and questioned for the murders but is bailed by Mills after blood work evidence undertaken by pathologist Lisa reveals that Shepard&#x27;s blood had strong amounts of rohypnol, which means she was incapacitated during the Schmidt murder and thus cannot have committed the crime.

Mills tells Shepard that he suspects Delmarco of being the killer, Delmarco having grown increasingly close to Shepard during the course of the investigation. The two turn up at Delmarco&#x27;s quayside home to question him. Mills serves Delmarco wine laced with rohypnol to incapacitate him, upon which Shepard realises that Mills is the true killer based on how he says they&#x27;re now &quot;in this together&quot;, while he sets up the scene to look as if Delmarco will commit suicide, akin to how her father had looked when he supposedly committed suicide. Mills admits he killed all of Shepard&#x27;s lovers, as well as her parents and her mother&#x27;s lovers, because he considered it his mission to prevent her growing up to be a dissolute woman like her mother. As her father&#x27;s partner, Mills had felt the responsibility to inform him that his wife was a nymphomaniac, which drove him insane. Furthermore, as he himself had an illicit affair with Shepard&#x27;s mother, Mills felt the need to kill her lovers, ashamed that he helped destroy his partner&#x27;s marriage and drove him insane. Mills then decided to put him out of his misery by killing him.

Shepard secretly transmits Mills&#x27;s confession to other police officers on a mobile phone, allowing her old partner Wilson to track them down. When Mills tries to shoot her and Delmarco, Shepard shoots him in the chest, killing him and causing him to fall off a dock into the water.

==Cast==

==Production==
In February 2002, it was announced producer Arnold Kopelson and Paramount Pictures were in the process of negotiating a just under seven figure purchase of Sarah Thorp&#x27;s spec script &quot;Blackout&quot; about the daughter of a serial killer who now works as a cop and comes to fear she might be a suspect in a rash of killings she’s investigating. In August of that year, it was announced Philip Kaufman was set to direct (and had provided some uncredited rewrites to the script) with Ashley Judd, Andy Garcia and Samuel L. Jackson as the leads with shooting taking place in San Francisco, California.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Despite its well-established director and cast, &quot;Twisted&quot; received almost universally negative reviews, with a rating of 2% on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from 135 critics with an average score of 3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;An implausible, overheated potboiler that squanders a stellar cast, &quot;Twisted&quot; is a clichéd, risible whodunit.&quot; The film is one of the lowest-rated on the site. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, the movie holds a score of 26 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

William Thomas writing for &quot;Empire&quot; magazine described the role-reversal of the film as &quot;contrived&quot;, while allowing that the film &quot;may dole out a few guilty pleasures&quot;.

===Box office===
The film earned $25,198,598 in the United States and Canada and $15,756,005 in other territories for a combined worldwide gross of $40,954,603—well below the film&#x27;s production budget of $50 million.

<text>LeRoy Braxton Cochran (January 6, 1919 – September 26, 1981) was an American sprinter and hurdler, winner of two gold medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

Born in Richton, Mississippi, as the ninth of ten children to a sportive family. Cochran played football and was a one-man track team in the high school. Cochran wanted to go to Tulane University with a football scholarship, but was persuaded by his older brother Commodore, who won a gold medal at 1924 Summer Olympics in 4×400 m relay, to go to Indiana University Bloomington with a track scholarship. Commodore later became also his coach.

After winning the AAU championships in 400 m hurdles in 1939, Cochran was selected to the 1940 US Olympic team to run 400 m flat, 400 m hurdles and 4×400 m relay race. But when the 1940 Summer Olympics were cancelled due to the World War II, Cochran entered the V-7 Navy officer training course in 1942, and went to Miami for training in the Navy&#x27;s Sub Chaser Training School. He served in the Pacific during the war and attended the University of Southern California in pursuit of graduate degrees in physiology after the war.

Cochran took up athletics again at USC and in 1942 set world indoor records in the 400 m and 440 yd and a world outdoor record in the 440 yd. He won his second AAU title in 400 m hurdles in 1948, thus qualifying to the Olympics. In the Olympic final Duncan White from Ceylon went off at a terrific pace, but by half distance Cochran was ahead. He won by a huge margin, beating second-placed White by 0.7 seconds. Cochran won his second gold medal as he ran the third leg of the 4×400 m relay for the winning USA team.

In 2010 Cochran was posthumously named to the National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

<text>The Frames are an Irish rock band based in Dublin. Founded in 1990 by Glen Hansard, the band has been influential in the Dublin rock music scene. The group has released six studio albums. In addition to Hansard, the band&#x27;s current line-up includes original member Colm Mac Con Iomaire, Joe Doyle, and Rob Bochnik.

==History==

The band was established in 1990 and consists of survivors of Dublin&#x27;s prolific early 1990s rock-and-roll scene. Through support slots, the band was central to the development of many emerging Irish rock bands of the time, including Turn and Bell X1, and a host of singer-songwriters such as Mundy, Paddy Casey, David Kitt and Damien Dempsey. In December 2004, Hansard appeared on stage to collaborate with Paddy Casey and The Dublin Gospel Choir. In 2007 The Frames toured Australia and New Zealand as the support act for Bob Dylan.

The name &quot;The Frames&quot; arose from Hansard&#x27;s habit of fixing bicycles of his friends. The large number of bicycle frames lying around his house led neighbours to dub it the &quot;house with the frames&quot;. In a 2001 interview, Hansard said, &quot;I worked in a bicycle shop for a little while, but the name came from ... my back garden was so full of frames, my house became known as The Frames house, much to my mother&#x27;s distaste, she hated it. But my garden was full of frames, old bikes, I would make up bikes for my friends out of all the old bikes. So it sort of became known if anybody found a bike up on the hill on the way home they would throw it into my garden, a graveyard for old bikes.&quot;

The band has had many members over the years, some of whom have also been, or later became, members of other Dublin rock bands. Colm Mac Con Iomaire and Dave Odlum both were founding members of folk group Kíla. Graham Downey, son of Thin Lizzy drummer Brian Downey, played bass for the band between 1993 and 1996.

The Frames have always collaborated closely with other groups that emerged from the buskers on Grafton Street, Dublin, where Hansard started his music career. Among these groups were the aforementioned Kíla, and Mic Christopher. When Christopher died in 2001, Hansard and his band were heavily involved in organising the Skylarkin&#x27; concert to commemorate his life and release the album. The Frames still occasionally perform Mic&#x27;s songs—chiefly &quot;Heyday&quot;—as a tribute.

The band is also known for interspersing snippets of songs by other artists into their own as a form of homage; notable examples are &quot;Redemption Song&quot; by Bob Marley, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; by Johnny Cash, &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; by James Shelton (as made popular by Jeff Buckley/Elkie Brooks) and &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; from &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

In 1991, Hansard came to public attention after taking the part of &quot;Outspan&quot; Foster in the film &quot;The Commitments&quot;. However, Hansard regretted this role as he felt it distracted from his music career. Mac Con Iomaire also had a cameo in the movie as a violinist auditioning for the band. Bronagh Gallagher, one of Hansard&#x27;s colleagues, can be seen wearing a Frames T-shirt in her appearance in the film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Hansard appeared on screen as the principal character parodied by Irish music comedy Web site Eyebrowy.com and in 2007 as the lead in the movie &quot;Once&quot; which featured his songs.

As of 2007, the band consisted of Glen Hansard, Joe Doyle, Colm Mac Con Iomaire, Rob Bochnik and Johnny Boyle. Various people played drums during 2003 and 2004, including Graham Hopkins who drummed &quot;Dance the Devil&quot;, &quot;Burn the Maps&quot;, and the band&#x27;s latest album &quot;The Cost&quot;. On one version of the album &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot;, the band used the name The Frames DC, to avoid confusion with an American band.

The band released its sixth studio album, &quot;The Cost&quot;, on 22 September 2006. They appeared on the setlist at Lollapalooza 2006 just 12 days afterward.

The band&#x27;s song &quot;Dream Awake&quot; was used in the pilot episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot;. Also, &quot;Finally&quot; was prominently featured in the 11th episode of the show, when the title character reaped the rewards of the detective work which he had been doing all season. However, a different song is used in the version of the episode on nbc.com. The band&#x27;s song &quot;Seven Day Mile&quot; was used in the season six premiere of House on Fox.

The band&#x27;s ex-bassist, John Carney, is now a film director, best known for writing and directing the film &quot;Once&quot;, which stars Hansard, who wrote much of the music for the film. Hansard and Marketa Irglova won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Falling Slowly&quot; from &quot;Once&quot;.

On 13 May 2008 the US iTunes store released a Deluxe Edition of &quot;The Cost&quot;. This edition included three extra songs—&quot;The Blood&quot;, &quot;No More I Love Yous&quot;, and &quot;This Low&quot;. It also included the music videos for &quot;Falling Slowly&quot;, &quot;Sad Songs&quot;, and &quot;The Side You Never Get to See&quot;.

In late 2009 the band appeared on The Swell Season&#x27;s album, &quot;Strict Joy&quot;. On 24 March 2010 the band announced their first concert in three years at Electric Picnic to celebrate their 20th anniversary.

The Song &quot;Rise&quot; from the album &quot;The Cost&quot; was featured at the end of season 3, episode 13 of the ABC series &quot;Castle&quot;.

On 1 December 2012 the band announced that the documentary &quot;In The Deep Shade&quot; would be released in 2013. The film, which captured their 2010 20th Anniversary Tour, was shot by Conor Masterson.

Since shooting to stardom in the wake of &#x27;Once&#x27; and his Oscar win, Hansard has played primarily solo concerts (often with several members of the Frames) in recent years. The Frames have continued to play a handful of gigs; in June 2014 they played Whelan&#x27;s in honor of its 25th anniversary, surprising the audience by buying all of their drinks. The venue&#x27;s owners had lent money to the band in the 1990s to enable them to record Fitzcarraldo.

In 2015, the band played a pair of shows at Iveagh Gardens in Dublin. On 4–5 July they treated an enthusiastic and loyal fan base to such rarities as 15 Seafort Parade. On 11 July they played the Marquee Festival in Cork.

In April 2020, the band were forced to postpone a sold-out show marking their 30th anniversary in Kilmainham, Dublin on 20 June 2020 due to the COVID-19 restrictions in force in Ireland. However they later surprised fans by playing a live set on Instagram from a secluded location in Ireland on the same date. The band subsequently rescheduled their three September 2020 shows in the US for dates in 2021 which were then cancelled due to complications with international travel restrictions and visas making it impossible for the band to enter the country to perform.

The Frames 30th Anniversary show finally went ahead in the grounds of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Dublin on the evening of 28 May 2022 to an audience of approximately 10,000 fans. Opening acts Cormac Begley and Wallis Bird entertained the audience before the headliners took to the stage at 8pm to deliver a 25-song setlist to the enthusiastic crowd on what was described as a &#x27;perfect summer&#x27;s evening&#x27;.

<text>A pocket protector is a sheath designed to hold writing instruments and other small implements in a shirt&#x27;s breast pocket, protecting it from tearing or staining. It may be used to carry pens, pencils, screwdrivers, small slide rules, and other small items. A flap over the outside of the pocket helps to secure the pocket protector. Pocket protectors were originally made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

==Invention==
The pocket protector was invented during World War II by Hurley Smith while he was working in Buffalo, New York. He filed to patent the device on June 3, 1943, and he received patent number on March 18, 1947. 

A competing claim for the invention came from Long Island plastics magnate Gerson Strassberg around 1952. Strassberg was working on plastic sleeves for bankbooks. One day, he placed one that he was working on into his shirt pocket while he took a phone call. When he noticed it there, he realized it would make a great product.

==Use==

Pocket protectors imprinted with logos or company names were first marketed to companies as promotional merchandise. A more general market soon arose, made up of students, engineers, and white-collar workers in a variety of fields. They have become part of a &quot;nerd&quot; or &quot;geek&quot; fashion stereotype, probably because of their association with engineers or students.

<doc id="971243" wikidata="Q606226" url="?curid=971243" title="The Black Keys">
<text>The Black Keys are an American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre&#x27;s revival in the 2000s. The band&#x27;s raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach&#x27;s blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Robert Johnson.

Friends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney formed the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, &quot;The Big Come Up&quot; (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad licensing of their songs. Their third album, &quot;Rubber Factory&quot; (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band&#x27;s profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo recorded &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot; (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator of the group.

The group&#x27;s commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with the album &quot;Brothers&quot;, which along with its popular single &quot;Tighten Up&quot;, won three Grammy Awards. Their 2011 follow-up &quot;El Camino&quot; received critical acclaim and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band&#x27;s career, the El Camino Tour. The album and its hit single &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; won another three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, &quot;Turn Blue&quot;, their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia. After completing the Turn Blue Tour in 2015, the duo took a hiatus for several years to work on side projects and produce other artists. They returned in 2019 with their ninth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;. They have since released three additional studio albums: &quot;Delta Kream&quot; (2021), consisting of hill country blues covers; &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; (2022); and &quot;Ohio Players&quot; (2024).

==History==
===Early history===
Guitarist and vocalist Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney first met when they were eight or nine years old while living in the same neighborhood of Akron, Ohio a couple houses down from each other. Auerbach and Carney both come from musical backgrounds. Auerbach is the cousin of guitarist Robert Quine, a &quot;veteran of New York&#x27;s avant-rock scene.&quot; Carney is the nephew of saxophonist Ralph Carney, who performed on several Tom Waits albums. While attending Firestone High School, they became friends, though they were part of different crowds—Auerbach was captain of the high school soccer team, while Carney was a social outcast. Encouraged by their brothers, the duo began jamming together in 1996, as Auerbach was learning guitar at the time and Carney owned a four-track recorder and a drum set. After graduating, both briefly attended the University of Akron before dropping out.

===Formation, &quot;The Big Come Up&quot;, and &quot;Thickfreakness&quot; (2001–2003)===
Auerbach attempted to make a living from performing at small bars in town, but realized he would not be able to book shows in other cities without a demo. To record one, he asked for help from Carney, who agreed to provide recording equipment and allow his basement to be used if Auerbach recruited the other musicians. However, none of Auerbach&#x27;s backing band showed up on the recording date. Instead, Carney and Auerbach jammed, eventually leading to the duo forming a band in mid-2001. Together, they recorded a six-song demo consisting of &quot;old blues rip-offs and words made up on the spot&quot; with minimal equipment. After sending the demo to a dozen record labels, they accepted an offer in 2002 from a small indie label in Los Angeles named Alive, because it was &quot;the only label that would sign [them] without having to see [them] first&quot;.
According to an interview on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;, the group&#x27;s name &quot;the Black Keys&quot; came from an acquaintance diagnosed with schizophrenia, Alfred McMoore. He would leave incoherent messages on their answering machines referring to their fathers as &quot;black keys&quot; such as &quot;D flat&quot; when he was upset with them. On March 20, 2002, the duo played their first live show at Cleveland&#x27;s Beachland Ballroom and Tavern to an audience of approximately eight people. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Big Come Up&quot;, was recorded entirely in Carney&#x27;s basement on an 8-track tape recorder in lo-fi and was released in May 2002, three months after they signed to Alive. The album, a mix of eight original tracks and five cover songs, forged a raw blues rock sound for the group; the covers included tracks originally by blues musicians Muddy Waters, Junior Kimbrough, and R. L. Burnside. Two tracks, covers of the traditional blues standard &quot;Leavin&#x27; Trunk&quot; and the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;She Said, She Said&quot;, were released as a single on Isota Records. The track &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Man&quot; would later be used as the theme song for the HBO series &quot;Hung&quot;. In order to help fund a tour, Auerbach and Carney took jobs mowing lawns for a landlord. Despite modest sales for &quot;The Big Come Up&quot;, it gained a cult following and attracted attention from critics, eventually landing the group a record deal with Fat Possum Records.

Within days of signing to Fat Possum, the Black Keys completed their second album, &quot;Thickfreakness&quot;. It was recorded in Carney&#x27;s basement in a single 14-hour session in December 2002, an approach necessitated because the group spent its small advance payment from Fat Possum on rent. The group had recorded sessions with producer Jeff Saltzman in San Francisco but ultimately aborted them, as they were unhappy that the results sounded too much like &quot;modern-rock radio&quot;. In March 2003, the group played at one of its first music festivals, South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, after driving for nearly 24 hours from Akron. Much as they did for the festival, Carney and Auerbach spent their early tour days driving themselves from show to show in a 1994 Chrysler van they nicknamed the &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;.

&quot;Thickfreakness&quot; was released on April 8, 2003, and received positive reviews from critics. The record spawned three singles: &quot;Set You Free&quot;, &quot;Hard Row&quot;, and a cover of Richard Berry&#x27;s &quot;Have Love, Will Travel&quot;. The other cover from the album was Junior Kimbrough&#x27;s &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; later named &quot;Thickfreakness&quot; the third-best album of 2003. That year, the duo received a lucrative offer of £200,000 to license one of their songs for use in an English mayonnaise advertisement. At the suggestion of their manager, they rejected the offer for fear of being perceived as &quot;sell-outs&quot; and alienating their fan base. The band toured extensively throughout 2003, playing its first dates outside of the United States and opening concerts for Sleater-Kinney, Beck, and Dashboard Confessional. However, exhaustion had set in by the end of the year, forcing the band to cancel European tour dates. In August, the group made its national television debut on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. As fellow garage band the White Stripes grew in popularity, the Black Keys drew comparisons to them—sometimes as a derivative act—since both groups had two-piece lineups, Midwest origins, bluesy sounds, and names with colors. In September, the Black Keys released a split-EP with the Six Parts Seven titled &quot;The Six Parts Seven/The Black Keys EP&quot;, featuring one song by the Six Parts Seven and three songs by the Black Keys.

===&quot;Rubber Factory&quot;, &quot;Magic Potion&quot;, and other releases (2004–2007)===
The Black Keys released an EP titled &quot;The Moan&quot; on January 19, 2004, featuring &quot;Have Love Will Travel&quot;, an alternate version of &quot;Heavy Soul&quot;, and two covers. The group found itself struggling to sell records or gain airplay of their songs on the radio, and they were not making much money either; they had to absorb a $3,000 loss from a European tour. Frustrated with their lack of success, the band relented and decided to begin licensing their music, beginning with the song &quot;Set You Free&quot; in a Nissan automobile commercial. It was the first of an eventual 300-plus song placements in television shows, films, TV commercials, and video games. The group played several high-profile musical festivals in the first half of 2004, including Coachella and Bonnaroo.
For their third album, &quot;Rubber Factory&quot;, the band was forced to find a new recording location, as the building that housed their basement studio was sold by its landlord. They created a makeshift studio in a former tire-manufacturing factory in Akron, and recorded from January to May 2004. The album was released on September 7, 2004, and became the group&#x27;s first record to chart on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, reaching number 143. &quot;Rubber Factory&quot; received critical acclaim and was named one of the year&#x27;s best albums by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Two singles were released, &quot;10 A.M. Automatic&quot; and the double A-side &quot;&#x27;Till I Get My Way/Girl Is on My Mind&quot;. Comedian David Cross directed the music video for &quot;10 A.M. Automatic&quot;. The duo promoted the album with tours in North America, Europe, and Australia. In 2005, the band released their first live video album, &quot;Live&quot;, recorded at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia on March 18, 2005. In July, they played at the Lollapalooza music festival.

On May 2, 2006, the Black Keys released &quot;&quot;, a 6-track album of cover versions of songs by Junior Kimbrough. It was the band&#x27;s final release with the independent label Fat Possum. Having fulfilled their two-album contract, the band signed with the major label Nonesuch Records. Later in May, the group released its second live album, &quot;Live in Austin, TX&quot;—also known as &quot;Thickfreakness in Austin&quot;—which was recorded in 2003. The group&#x27;s music appeared in several television commercials over the course of the year; among the companies to license its music were Sony, Nissan, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret, which used &quot;The Desperate Man&quot; in a lingerie commercial featuring Heidi Klum. Despite having the resources of a major record label available to them, the group elected to return to recording in Carney&#x27;s basement for its fourth studio album, &quot;Magic Potion&quot;. Released on September 12, 2006, the album was the group&#x27;s first release on Nonesuch, as well as its first album to comprise all original songs. Three singles were issued: &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, &quot;Your Touch&quot;, and &quot;Just Got to Be&quot;. In support of &quot;Magic Potion&quot;, the band embarked on its largest tour to that point, performing in large theaters and 1,000-seat venues. The Black Keys recorded covers of &quot;The Wicked Messenger&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; and &quot;If You Ever Slip&quot; for &quot;The Hottest State&quot; soundtrack.
===&quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot; and side projects (2007–2009)===

In 2007, producer Danger Mouse began working on a record for Ike Turner and asked the Black Keys to write a few songs for the project. The collaboration ultimately fell through, and Turner later died in December 2007. The duo decided to turn the material they had written into their fifth studio album, &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot;, and they asked Danger Mouse to produce the record. The sessions saw the band transitioning away from their &quot;homemade&quot; ethos to record-making; not only was it the first time that the band completed an album in a professional studio, but it was also the first time they hired an outside producer to work on a record. Danger Mouse supplemented the band&#x27;s sound with instrumental flourishes and more polished production values. Released on April 1, 2008, &quot;Attack &amp; Release&quot; debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Four singles were released: &quot;Strange Times&quot;, &quot;I Got Mine&quot;, &quot;Oceans and Streams&quot;, and &quot;Same Old Thing&quot;. &quot;Strange Times&quot; was featured in the video games &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; and &quot;NASCAR 09&quot;. &quot;I Got Mine&quot; is used as the theme song for Canadian police drama TV series &quot;The Bridge&quot;. The song was ranked number 23 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 100 Best Singles of 2008.

On October 17, 2008, the Black Keys was an opening act for fellow Akron-area band Devo at a special benefit concert at the Akron Civic Theatre for presidential candidate Barack Obama. Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, also an Akron native and Firestone High School graduate, followed their set. In November, they toured through Europe together with Liam Finn. That month, the group released the concert video &quot;Live at the Crystal Ballroom&quot;, which was filmed on April 4, 2008, at the group&#x27;s show at Crystal Ballroom in Portland, Oregon. The video was produced by Lance Bangs.
Tensions grew within the band in 2009. Prior to Carney&#x27;s divorce from his wife Denise Grollmus, Auerbach found it increasingly difficult to communicate with the drummer due to his antipathy for Grollmus. Auerbach said, &quot;I really hated her from the start and didn&#x27;t want anything to do with her.&quot; In February, Auerbach released his debut solo album, &quot;Keep It Hid&quot;. Carney, who claimed Auerbach did not tell him about the side project, felt betrayed. Carney subsequently formed the indie band Drummer, with whom he played bass guitar. The group released its debut album &quot;Feel Good Together&quot; on September 29, 2009.

The Black Keys reconciled later in the year. On June 6, 2009, they performed along with the Roots, TV on the Radio, Public Enemy, Antibalas, and other acts at the 2nd Annual Roots Picnic on the Festival Pier in Philadelphia. They also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

&quot;Blakroc&quot;, a collaborative album featuring the Black Keys and several hip hop artists, was released in 2009 on Black Friday. The project was supported and brought together by Damon Dash, who is a big fan of the band. The album features rappers Mos Def, Ludacris, RZA, Raekwon, Pharoahe Monch, Q-Tip, NOE, Jim Jones, Nicole Wray, M.O.P., and the late Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. The album was recorded in Brooklyn, New York by co-producer, engineer and mixer Joel Hamilton at Studio G. Auerbach said on the official Blakroc site, &quot;Pat and I have been preparing for this record since we were 16.&quot;

===&quot;Brothers&quot; and commercial breakthrough (2010–2011)===
Auerbach and Carney moved to Nashville in 2010, where they established a studio downtown.

The group&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Brothers&quot;, was released on May 18, 2010. Recorded primarily at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, the album was produced by the Black Keys and Mark Neill, and was mixed by Tchad Blake. The song &quot;Tighten Up&quot;, the only track from the album produced by Danger Mouse, preceded the album as the lead single. The song became their most successful single to that point, spending 10 weeks at number one on the Alternative Songs chart and becoming the group&#x27;s first single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 87. The song also reached gold certification status. The music video for &quot;Tighten Up&quot;, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero, won the 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Breakthrough Video. &quot;Brothers&quot; sold over 73,000 copies in the US in its first week and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, their best performance on the chart to that point. In total, the record sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, including 870,000 copies in the US, and it was certified double-platinum in Canada, platinum in the US, and gold in the UK. The Black Keys were among several artist judges at the 9th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

The band continued to gain exposure through continued song licensing, so much so that they were Warner Bros. Records&#x27; most-licensed band of the year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;Brothers&quot; at number two on its list of the best albums of 2010 and &quot;Everlasting Light&quot; at number 11 on the list of the year&#x27;s best songs. &quot;Spin&quot; named the Black Keys the &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; for 2010. On January 8, 2011, the band appeared as the musical guest on American television sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. At the 53rd Grammy Awards, &quot;Brothers&quot; and its songs won awards in three of the five categories they were nominated in; the band received honors for Best Alternative Music Album (for &quot;Brothers&quot;) and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (for &quot;Tighten Up&quot;), while Michael Carney, the band&#x27;s creative director and Patrick&#x27;s brother, won Best Recording Package for designing the album&#x27;s artwork.
The band&#x27;s sudden success proved overwhelming, as they found themselves booking additional promotional commitments and facing demand for additional touring dates. In January 2011, the group canceled concerts in Australia, New Zealand, and Europe, citing exhaustion, thus clearing out most of their touring schedule into April. Patrick Carney said, &quot;We&#x27;ve been touring long enough to know when we&#x27;re about to hit our breaking point.&quot; The desire to record another album soon after &quot;Brothers&quot; also led to the decision. Carney said, &quot;We could have waited another year or so, and milked the &quot;Brothers&quot; album and kept touring, but we like bands, and our favourite bands growing up and even today, are bands that put out a lot of music and every album is different from the last.&quot;

&quot;Brothers&quot;″ second single, &quot;Howlin&#x27; for You&quot;, was a successful follow-up, achieving a gold certification in the US. The music video, directed by Chris Marrs Piliero, parodied action movie trailers and starred Tricia Helfer, Diora Baird, Sean Patrick Flanery, Christian Serratos, Corbin Bernsen, Todd Bridges, and Shaun White. It was nominated for the 2011 MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video. In 2014, the band donated the song rights to PETA for an animal adoption ad campaign.

The Black Keys were nominated for three Billboard Music Awards: Top Alternative Artist, and Top Rock Album and Top Alternative Album for &quot;Brothers&quot;. The group continued to make appearances at American music festivals throughout the year, playing at Bonnaroo, Kanrocksas, and Outside Lands.

===&quot;El Camino&quot; (2011–2013)===
The group recorded their seventh studio album, &quot;El Camino&quot;, from March to May 2011. Splitting time between touring and recording, the band spent 41 days at Easy Eye Sound Studio, which was opened in 2010 by Auerbach in the duo&#x27;s new hometown of Nashville, Tennessee. For the album, Danger Mouse reprised his role as producer and also contributed as a co-writer on all 11 songs. After struggling to translate the slower songs from &quot;Brothers&quot; to a live setting, the band decided to write more uptempo tracks for &quot;El Camino&quot;. The record draws from popular genres from the 1950s–1970s, including rock and roll, glam rock, rockabilly, surf rock, and soul. The band cited several retro acts as musical influences on the album, including the Clash, the Cramps, T. Rex, Ramones, the Beatles, the Sweet, the Cars, and Johnny Burnette.
&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; was released in October as the album&#x27;s lead single, accompanied by a popular one-shot music video of a man dancing and lip-syncing. The song became the group&#x27;s best-charting single in several countries, reaching number 64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 2 on the Australian Singles Chart, and number 33 on the Canadian Hot 100. The song was certified nine-times platinum in Canada, triple platinum in Australia, platinum in New Zealand, and gold in Denmark. The band returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a musical guest on December 3, 2011. &quot;El Camino&quot; was released three days later and received wide critical acclaim. In the US, it debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 206,000 copies in its first week, the highest single-week sales and (to that point) charting position the group had achieved in the country. Many publications, such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; ranked &quot;El Camino&quot; among the best albums of the year, despite its late release. The album was certified double-platinum in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; platinum in the US, UK, and Ireland; and gold in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France.
In 2012, the group commenced the first headlining arena tour of its career, the El Camino Tour, playing dates in Europe and North America. After tickets went on sale, their show at Madison Square Garden sold out in 15 minutes. Just as it did on its previous tour, the group added bassist Gus Seyffert and keyboardist/guitarist John Wood as touring musicians in order to perform songs as close to their studio arrangements as possible. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Gold on the Ceiling&quot;, like its predecessor, went to number one on the Alternative Songs chart and was certified platinum in Australia and Canada. The group headlined several music festivals throughout the year, including Catalpa Music Festival, Coachella, Memphis in May (in 2013), Lollapalooza, and Osheaga. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, &quot;El Camino&quot; and &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; were nominated in five categories and were winners in three; the album won Best Rock Album, while &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; won Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song.

===&quot;Turn Blue&quot; and hiatus (2013–2018)===

For their eighth studio album, &quot;Turn Blue&quot;, the band once again collaborated with Danger Mouse, who co-produced and co-wrote the album. It was recorded primarily at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California, from July–August 2013, with additional recording at Key Club in Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Nashville&#x27;s Easy Eye Sound in early 2014. The album was announced in March 2014 via Mike Tyson&#x27;s Twitter account, with a link to a cryptic teaser video on YouTube featuring a hypnotist, and was released on May 13, 2014. The record exhibits psychedelic rock and soul influences and features a more melancholy tone, largely in part due to Auerbach dealing with the divorce from his wife during the album sessions. The first single, &quot;Fever&quot; was released on March 24, while a second single, &quot;Turn Blue&quot;, followed on April 14. The album debuted at number one in the US and Australia, the band&#x27;s first record to top the album charts in either country; 164,000 copies were sold in the US in its first week. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, with &quot;Fever&quot; being nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song as well as the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance. In May 2014, the Black Keys embarked on a world tour to support the album, with Cage the Elephant, Jake Bugg, and St. Vincent all separately opening for them. Several shows on the tour were cancelled after Carney broke and dislocated his shoulder in a swimming accident while vacationing in Saint Barthélemy in January 2015.

After concluding their tour with a performance at Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in August 2015, the Black Keys began an extended hiatus. Shortly after they began their hiatus, the band were ranked No. 20 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. During the band&#x27;s hiatus, Auerbach and Carney were involved in several musical projects on their own. Auerbach formed the Arcs in 2015, who released their debut album, &quot;Yours, Dreamily,&quot; that September. He also released his second solo album, &quot;Waiting on a Song&quot;, in 2017, and contributed to albums by artists such as the Pretenders, A$AP Rocky and Jake Bugg. Meanwhile, Carney worked as a producer on albums by Tobias Jesso, Jr. and Karen Elson, and he composed the theme song to the Netflix animated series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; with his late uncle Ralph Carney. In 2017, Carney served as a co-writer, producer, and drummer on &quot;Hopeless Romantic&quot;, the first studio album by Michelle Branch in 14 years. After beginning a relationship while working on the album, the two were engaged in July 2017 and married in April 2019.

===&quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;, &quot;Delta Kream&quot;, and &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; (2019–2023)===

On March 7, 2019, the Black Keys released the single &quot;Lo/Hi&quot;, their first new music released in five years. A week later, the band announced a North American tour co-headlining with Modest Mouse and openers *repeat repeat. On April 25, the Black Keys released &quot;Eagle Birds&quot;, the second single from their ninth album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;. &quot;Lo/Hi&quot; became the band&#x27;s first single to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. On May 16, the band released &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;″s third single, &quot;Go&quot;.

On April 13, 2021, the Black Keys announced an album comprising 11 covers of hill country blues songs titled &quot;Delta Kream&quot;, which was released on May 14, 2021. It is their second release of hill country blues covers following the &quot;Chulahoma&quot; EP in 2006. The announcement was made through the band&#x27;s Lonely Boys and Girls fan club, through which they also premiered the album&#x27;s opening track, a cover of John Lee Hooker&#x27;s version of &quot;Crawling Kingsnake&quot;.
On March 10, 2022, the group released the song &quot;Wild Child&quot;, their first original music since &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot;, along with a music video. This coincided with the announcement of their eleventh album, &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot;, which was released on May 13, 2022. A second single, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over&quot;, was released on April 27, 2022.

On August 11, 2023, the Black Keys released the song &quot;No Lovin&#x27;&quot;, their contribution to the compilation album &quot;Tell Everybody! (21st Century Juke Joint Blues From Easy Eye Sound)&quot;.

===&quot;Ohio Players&quot; and &quot;No Rain, No Flowers&quot; (2024–present)===
On January 12, 2024, the band released the single &quot;Beautiful People (Stay High)&quot;, taken from their twelfth studio album &quot;Ohio Players&quot;. The album was released on April 5, 2024, on streaming services, as well as vinyl, CD and cassette. The album was well received with one review saying the Black Keys have &#x27;found that creative musical joy again&#x27;

In March 2024, the band appeared at SXSW 2024, participating in an onstage interview during a keynote event. The documentary film &quot;This Is a Film About the Black Keys&quot;, directed by Jeff Dupre, debuted as part of the film festival. They also performed at SXSW on March 14 and 15. A North America arena tour titled the &quot;International Players Tour&quot; was announced in April 2024, but was suddenly canceled in May. The band would announce later the tour would be rescheduled for smaller venues. In June 2024 the band split from their managers Irving Azoff and Steve Moir. Media speculation questioned if the tour changes and management departure was due to poor ticket sales, which Carney eventually responded to on social media stating &quot;We got fucked. I&#x27;ll let you all know how so it doesn&#x27;t happen to you. Stay tuned.&quot;

In late 2024 the band released the singles &quot;Mi Tormenta&quot; featuring DannyLux and &quot;Stay in Your Grave&quot; featuring Alice Cooper in advance of the deluxe &quot;Trophy Edition&quot; of Ohio Players. The band was announced for a show on the &quot;2024 America Loves Crypto Tour&quot; at the Akron Civic Center. The booking was criticized by lifestyle magazine &quot;GQ&quot; due to the tour&#x27;s relationship to political action committees financing cryptocurrency friendly politicians in the 2024 US elections. In a later interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; the band would explain the details of their 2024 tour cancelation due to poor sales, and justified the crypto show as a way to make some income to compensate the staff who were working on the canceled 2024 tour. The band criticized Live Nation Entertainment for monopolistic actions against musicians, and stated a belief the 2024 touring environment was becoming hostile to artists. 

During the cancellation of the 2024 tour, the band returned to studio to record the album &quot;No Rain, No Flowers&quot; which is planned for a 2025 release. An accompanying tour for &quot;No Rain, No Flowers&quot; was announced along with the release of the first single &quot;The Night Before.&quot;

==Musical style==
The Black Keys have been described as blues rock, garage rock, punk blues, indie rock, lo-fi, and alternative rock. According to &quot;Paste,&quot; &quot;they&#x27;ve bounced from the blues to psychedelia to classic, good ol&#x27; fashioned rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, and so many of their most interesting tunes bring all those elements together&quot;.

<doc id="971246" wikidata="Q5141067" url="?curid=971246" title="Cog (band)">
<text>Cog are an Australian progressive rock band that formed in 1998. Their debut album, &quot;The New Normal&quot;, was nominated for Triple J&#x27;s 2005 J Award. The band&#x27;s music is influenced by Tool, Isis, Nina Simone, Bob Marley, Leftfield, Deftones and Helmet.

==History==
===Pre-1998===

Flynn Gower and Lucius Borich (the son of renowned Australian blues guitarist Kevin Borich) were friends at their Bondi high school in the 1980s. Borich being a drummer, and Flynn being a guitarist, they would occasionally jam. As their school careers finished, Borich formed the band Juice while Flynn formed the five-piece metal band The Hanging Tree, popular in the Sydney live circuit. In 1995, after the release of Juice&#x27;s debut album, Borich left the band and joined The Hanging Tree. Shortly after the release of their debut, Borich left the band and the country, travelling to the United States to follow a career of session drumming. There Borich did session drumming for a large range of genres, writing songs on his guitar all the while. Flynn, in Sydney, wanted to form a band and contacted Lucius, eventually resulting in the formation of Cog.

===Formation and early releases (1998–2003)===

Initially, the band was to form in the United States, but Borich chose to travel home. He&#x27;d find a disappointed Flynn, who had already sold all his gear in preparation for the move. The drum, bass, and guitar parts for what would become the &quot;Just Visiting&quot; EPs were recorded shortly after, in 1998, with Borich assuming bass duties. The vocals would be recorded two years later. To fill out the bass in live shows, Flynn recruited his brother Luke, formerly of the Sydney band Tax. After they formed this legitimate lineup, they toured aggressively, clocking up thousands of kilometres of weekly driving between Sydney and Melbourne.

Their first residency, at the &quot;Forrest Inn Hotel&quot; in the Sydney suburbs, was without a vocalist. They encouraged people to send them demos for the vocal job, but the band were so unimpressed with the demos that Flynn trained his voice to fill the vacancy. Their breakthrough gig was a Wednesday headlining slot at &quot;Excelsior Hotel&quot; in Surry Hills, where they packed out the club consistently for 4 months. They were recognised with a nomination for &quot;best emerging live band in NSW&quot; at the Australian Live Music Awards. In 2001, the band signed with underground label Little Samurai Records and prepared to release the &quot;Just Visiting Part One&quot; and &quot;Just Visiting Part Two&quot; EPs.

The two EPs, despite the slight differences in style between them, were written and recorded at the same time. The band chose not to release the studio session as a full album so they would not lose their debut album virginity, and would get twice the publicity. They grabbed a breakthrough gig just before the release of &quot;Just Visiting Part One&quot;, supporting System of a Down at the Hordern Pavilion. &quot;Just Visiting Part One&quot; was released in February 2002 and was still consistently appearing in the ARIA Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs chart over 2 years after its release. In July, the song &quot;Bondi&quot; was added to Andrew Haug&#x27;s Triple J 3 Hours of Power Compilation.

&quot;Just Visiting Part Two&quot; was released in October that same year and was also still appearing in the ARIA Top 20 Heavy Rock/Metal singles/EPs charts after two years. That year, Cog also won &quot;best emerging live band in NSW&quot; at the Australian Live Music Awards. After an extensive tour supporting the two EPs, including a slot at the Big Day Out in 2003, Cog recorded a cover of &quot;Open Up&quot;, a single released in 1993 by Leftfield featuring John Lydon. This song had been a live favourite for the previous year.

Shortly afterwards, Cog continued to write and demo for their debut album.

===&quot;The New Normal&quot; (2004–2006)===
While the vast majority of the material for &quot;The New Normal&quot; had already been demoed by late 2003, with some songs first performed live as far back as May 2002, Cog did not have the kind of financial backing needed to record their album as they desired. However, after months of limbo, Cog were signed by Aloha Management (Shihad, Killing Heidi) and subsequently, former Universal Music Australia head Paul Krige&#x27;s label Difrnt Music.

During the later months of 2004, Cog recorded their debut album, &quot;The New Normal&quot;, in the small logging town of Weed, California with producer Sylvia Massy (System of a Down and Tool). Shortly afterwards, the band performed a short tour of the east coast and played at the inaugural Pyramid Rock Festival. The album was released in Australia in April 2005, to a debut of No. 19 in the ARIA Charts, and a No. 1 debut in the &quot;Australian Independent Recordings&quot; (AIR) album charts. &quot;The New Normal&quot; was one of the nominees for the 2005 Triple J J Award.

In support of the album, the band headlined a full Australian tour in April and May with supports from Karnivool and In the Grey. During July they supported Shihad on a tour of New Zealand. During October they toured the country with supports from The Fumes, Grand Fatal, and Jakob. They finished the year with appearances at Homebake, the Pyramid Rock Festival, and the Big Day Out. Cog supported Australian rock group Grinspoon at the Adelaide race event Clipsal 500 and appeared at the Rock-It Festival in Perth on 19 March with Silverchair, Grinspoon, and Shihad amongst others. During March and April, the band toured the country in support of the final radio single from &quot;The New Normal&quot;, &quot;Resonate&quot;.

===&quot;Sharing Space&quot; (2007–2010)===
Cog, from June 2006 onwards, planned to spend a portion of the year in the United States, promoting a release of &quot;The New Normal&quot; there through extensive touring. However, this release was pushed back to 2007.

On 9 January, Cog began to record and write tracks for their second album, entitled &quot;Sharing Space&quot;, at Weed, California, once again with Sylvia Massy producing. They took a break from recording in June, bouncing back to Australia for the &quot;Boomerang Tour&quot; for a number of shows. The short tour run included Fremantle, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney, where several new songs were premiered, including &quot;Bird of Feather&quot; (then titled &quot;Double Triple&quot;) and &quot;What If&quot;. Cog toured Australia more extensively in November 2007, in support of &quot;What If?&quot;, the first single from the new album due April 2008. This tour marked Cog&#x27;s first trip to North Queensland.

On 3 November, Cog released &quot;What If&quot;, the first single from &quot;Sharing Space&quot; with the title track to the album as a b-side. On 12 November, this song debuted at No. 21 on the physical ARIA singles chart, the only new entry debuting higher being Alicia Keys.
&quot;Sharing Space&quot; was released on 12 April 2008. In February, the band announced that they will be touring around Australia in support of Sharing Space in May and June. They performed shows around the country with two New Zealand bands, Kora and Jakob, as well as local Melbourne prog-rock band Sleep Parade and Brisbane&#x27;s Melodyssey. Despite the conflict and difficulty of the recording process of &quot;Sharing Space&quot;, Borich commented on the process saying &quot;You can’t really put a timeframe on creating art...sometimes you have to struggle through in order to come up with the goods musically. Otherwise it’s not going to have any validity or longevity&quot;.

In July 2008, Cog performed in England for the first time at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire and GuilFest with New Zealand band Shihad. They also expressed interest in releasing &quot;Sharing Space&quot; in Europe.

In 2008, the band had the opportunity to re-release their 2002 EPs &quot;Just Visiting Part One&quot; and &quot;Just Visiting Part Two&quot; as a full album; &quot;Just Visiting&quot;, with the intended track listing and the never previously heard original (long) version of &quot;Bondi&quot;. Lucius Borich spent time at &quot;Studios 301&quot; mastering the album so the recordings sounded their best.

In June and July 2009, the band toured Australia with support from British-based band Oceansize. The tour was the band&#x27;s most successful headlining tour to date. The band at the 2009 Big Day Out, performing at all the Australian dates.

In 2010, the band released &quot;The Sound of Three: 12 Years With You&quot;, a CD/DVD produced by Lucius Borich. Containing a recording from the band&#x27;s &quot;Between Oceans&quot; tour, and a documentary on this history of the band (on the DVD only). The band toured the album in early June; Lucius Borich had hinted in several interviews that these might have been the last shows Cog would play as a band.

Cog played what many had believed to be their last show at The Tivoli in Brisbane on Saturday 12 June 2010, thanking their various crew members one by one between songs. The band finished with &quot;No Other Way&quot;, the opening track from their second album, &quot;Sharing Space&quot;. However, the band played four more shows - one at the Full Noise Festival in Townsville, one at a Sydney nightclub, and two smaller shows in the outer Melbourne suburbs of Frankston and Ferntree Gully. Their Sydney show on 22 December 2010 was Cog&#x27;s last show until they reform six years later.

===Hiatus (2011–2016)===
Lucius Borich soon joined Floating Me, a band featuring ex-members of Scary Mother and Jon Stockman of Karnivool. Floating Me released their debut self-titled album in 2011. Flynn and Luke Gower went on to form The Occupants in 2012. Their first single, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Thinking&quot;, was released in April 2013. It was followed by an EP in 2014.

===Reunion and &quot;The Middle&quot; (2016–present)===
In late January 2016, the official Cog Facebook page was updated for the first time in nearly three years with new photos. In the weeks that followed, the band put up entire photo albums of previously unseen photos taken on tours from over the years. This subsequently lead to speculation regarding the band getting back together. The following month, it was confirmed that Cog would reunite for a run of headlining shows in July 2016.

Throughout 2017, Cog have been working on new material, posting regular updates to the band&#x27;s Instagram account of the album&#x27;s progress.

The band&#x27;s single &quot;The Middle&quot; was released in 2018, making it their first new music in ten years. They have since released two more singles titled &quot;Altered States&quot; and &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, the latter being the focus of the upcoming 2019 Drawn Together Tour.

===Controversy===

In 2021, Cog stirred controversy when frontman Flynn Gower shared posts of anti-vaccination rhetoric and conspiracies surrounding COVID-19 on social media, while also publicly voicing his support for the anti-lockdown protests in New South Wales.

<doc id="971247" wikidata="Q1654171" url="?curid=971247" title="Kitana">
<text>Kitana is a fictional character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; media franchise originally by Midway Games and later by NetherRealm Studios. Debuting in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) as a player character and as a royal from the fictional realm of Edenia. She uses steel fans as her primary weapon. In the series, Kitana is aligned with multiple characters, especially Mileena who originally served as her clone, however, as the series evolves, Mileena suddenly becomes the older sister of Kitana and takes her place being the empress of Outworld. Kitana also shares the relationship as the love interest for the series&#x27; protagonist Liu Kang.

During the development of the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), a character known as &quot;Kitsune&quot; was intended by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias to be in the game but was removed, that character later came into existence under the name &quot;Kitana&quot;, which is derived from two words &quot;Kitsune&quot; and &quot;Katana&quot;. Throughout the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series, she eventually becomes one of its mainstays. Kitana is depicted as a warm-blooded woman, fighting for the protection of her realm and its people. Kitana has been featured in various media outside of the games, such as films and comics. She is well received by critics for her appearance, personality, and character development.

==History and development==
Early development of the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; featured a character named &quot;Kitsune&quot;, conceived by series co-creator and character designer John Tobias and inspired by the character of Princess Mariko from Jordan Mechner&#x27;s 1984 computer game &quot;Karateka&quot;. She was intended to be an unplayable herald-like character who wielded a single ornamental fan and was &quot;Shang Lao&#x27;s princess daughter — the spoil of victory for winning the tournament&quot; who would ultimately betray her father after she fell for the game&#x27;s protagonist Liu Kang. Kitsune was ultimately omitted from the game but included in the sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, with her storyline revised as her being the stepdaughter of the game&#x27;s main antagonist Shao Kahn. Tobias renamed the character &quot;Kitana&quot; as her original name was rejected for being Japanese and thus not compatible with &quot;Shang and Shao who were both Chinese in origin&quot; (before the games &quot;ultimately became a hodgepodge of nonsensical Asian mythological hooha anyway&quot;), with Kitana serving as &quot;a combo of Kitsune &amp; Katana&quot; that sounded &quot;generically Asian enough.&quot; She was originally outfitted with a pair of sai before Ed Boon suggested that the character could be palette-swapped, which resulted in the creation of Kitana&#x27;s twin Mileena and her being given the sai while Kitana instead brandished war fans. In 2009, Boon included Kitana among the series&#x27; most recognizable characters alongside Scorpion, Sub-Zero, and Liu Kang. Skarlet, a female ninja who debuted as a playable character in the 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; reboot, originated in &quot;MKII&quot; by way of false player rumors of a glitch that would turn Kitana&#x27;s outfit red.

Martial artist Katalin Zamiar played Kitana and the game&#x27;s other palette-swapped female ninjas in &quot;MKII&quot;, with Kitana&#x27;s steel fans used for filming constructed from a reflective paper material. She was hired for the role after meeting Boon and Tobias, who were members of her fitness center at the time. Zamiar did not return for &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; due to legal issues with Midway Games, and was replaced by Becky Gable. Kitana was included in early versions of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; before being replaced by new character Tanya. For the series&#x27; transition into 3-D beginning with &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, Kitana and the other ninja characters were given their own distinct redesigns.

Most of Kitana&#x27;s special moves utilize her fans either as a melee weapon, a projectile, or to lift her enemies airborne. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and onward, Kitana&#x27;s play style is split into three fighting variations like those of the game&#x27;s other characters. According to Boon, Kitana&#x27;s &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; Fatality, first seen in &quot;MKII&quot;, was inspired by the demise of villain Mr. Big (Dr. Kananga) in the 1973 James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. Kitana&#x27;s other most commonly recurring finisher has her decapitate opponents with her fan, which has been featured in almost all of her game appearances and is expanded in &quot;Mortal Kombat 2011&quot; where she cuts off the defeated opponents&#x27; arms before beheading them.

=== Gameplay ===
Kitana was chosen as the best &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; fighter by the editors of &quot;Sega Power&quot; and &quot;Super Play&quot; for being &quot;good all around&quot; and due to her quick attacks and perceived similarities to Chun-Li. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; too called her &quot;a really good character to pick&quot; and Cinema Blend stated Kitana &quot;could absolutely dominate&quot; the game. However, &quot;GamePro&#x27;s&quot; strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in &quot;MKII&quot; (citing her devastating combos, powerful &quot;Fan Throw&quot; move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by &quot;Complex&quot;, Kitana &quot;had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps.&quot; &quot;Kitana&#x27;s big combos in the corner&quot; were among Ed Boon&#x27;s own personal favourite things in the game: &quot;When I saw people do Kitana&#x27;s combos I knew there was something special, because people were taking the game to a new direction.&quot; &quot;EGM&quot; described Kitana as &quot;a force to be reckoned with&quot; and predicted she would &quot;make a big impact as her Fan Wave leaves foes open to combos.&quot; In the Game Gear version of &quot;MKII&quot;, however, Kitana&#x27;s fan lifts the opponent too low and too far away for an easy combo.

Kitana&#x27;s combo abilities were severely downgraded for &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (and, by extension, &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;), for which she received no new special moves unlike most of the other characters. According to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;with such a small repertoire, Princess Kitana will be sorely challenged by experienced warriors,&quot; even as her fan toss is faster than many other projectile attacks. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; opined that &quot;Kitana&#x27;s lack of enhancements doesn&#x27;t make her as exciting to play as some of the other characters, though her excellent juggle combos still work - and they can do loads of damage,&quot; According to &quot;Total 64&quot;, &quot;her moves are a little unfriendly and her combos are a touch difficult.&quot; &quot;EGM Strategy Guide&quot; for &quot;UMK3&quot; stated: &quot;She had deadly corner traps with damage in up to 90 percent [in &quot;MKII&quot;]. Now, her fan-raise combos have been severely crippled to almost not being worth it.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;X360&quot; called the CPU Kitana &quot;the worst possible character to come up against&quot; in the single-player Tower mode of &quot;UMK3&quot;, as she is &quot;fast, impossible to sweep, and capable of rendering any opponent incapable with a waft of her fan.&quot; According to &quot;Dreamcast Magazine&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot;&#x27;s returning &quot;old favourites like Sub-Zero, Kitana and Baraka&quot; too had by then &quot;dated moves and fatalities.&quot; Her combos improved in the later games, and according to BradyGames&#x27; official guide for &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot;, &quot;Kitana stays at the top of the heap as far as kombatants go. In any stance, she can pump out over 30% with relative ease, making her one of the deadliest in the hands of a beginner or a master.&quot; Kitana was later found to be capable of infinite-loop corner combos in her &quot;Mournful&quot; variation in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat:&quot; &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot;, Kitana is fought as a boss character twice in the game&#x27;s main story mode and is one of unlockable player characters for the versus mode. Prima Games&#x27; guide to &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot; states she is &quot;quick enough for moderate damage, and has some of the most potent special moves in the game,&quot; but her limitation is she needs to be fighting at close range to make use of it. Regarding &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;, however, Prima declared Kitana &quot;a tough character to win with&quot; and &quot;like many of the other low tier character types, she&#x27;s lacking in almost every aspect&quot; (even as she &quot;is a little better on defense than she is on offense&quot;). She was rated overall only 4/10 for this game. Their official guide for &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;, on the other hand, called her &quot;one of the more dangerous characters in the game due to her speed and extremely effective move-set.&quot; Prima&#x27;s official guide for 2011&#x27;s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; deemed Kitana a capable fighter who once again &quot;is at her deadliest in the corner&quot; and is also especially good if played against Baraka and Cyber Sub-Zero. Prima observed Kitana in &quot;MK2011&quot; as her &quot;cheapest&quot; (unduly overpowered) incarnation so far, stating &quot;Kitana is not only one of the most damaging characters in the game, but in addition to the Fan Lift and Square Wave Punch, she can combo her Air Fan almost any time an opponent is airborne.&quot; According to Prima&#x27;s guide to &quot;MKX&quot;, &quot;Kitana is one of the more unique characters in the game&quot; due to her inheriting many of Jade&#x27;s special moves, and she &quot;is a zoning character at heart, but she can play offensively or defensively&quot; depending on a variation chosen. The guide recommended the &quot;Mournful&quot; variant for former Jade players, and the &quot;Assassin&quot; variant, which &quot;tries to take the generally defensive style Kitana has in &quot;MKX&quot; and add some offensive firepower to it,&quot; for veteran Kitana players.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Kitana debuts in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) alongside her sister Mileena as Outworld emperor Shao Kahn&#x27;s personal assassins. While she is ten thousand years old, she resembles a younger woman. In her ending, Kitana turns against Kahn after learning that her parents were once rulers of Outworld until they were forcefully overthrown by Kahn, while Mileena is actually an evil clone created by the sorcerer Shang Tsung.

Kitana and the series&#x27; other ninja characters were excluded from &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), but her backstory is expanded therein with the introduction of new character Sindel. Kitana is revealed as the daughter of Queen Sindel and King Jerrod, who ruled the Outworld realm of Edenia until it was invaded by Kahn and his forces, during which Kahn kills Jerrod and takes Kitana as his daughter. After Sindel commits suicide rather than serve as Kahn&#x27;s consort, she is resurrected and used by Kahn as a means to illegally invade Earthrealm. Realizing her life had been a lie, Kitana turns against Kahn and allies with Earth&#x27;s champions to defeat him. The ninjas returned as playable characters in the 1995 upgrade &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, in which Kitana is tried for treason after killing her evil twin Mileena, but before a verdict is reached, Kitana escapes and joins the Earth heroes to reach Sindel and warn her of her true past. Kitana and fellow Edenian Jade free Sindel from Shao Kahn&#x27;s mind control, which enables reigning Mortal Kombat champion Liu Kang to defeat him and results in Edenia and Earth returning to their peaceful states.

During the events of &quot;Mortal Kombat Gold&quot; (1999; a Dreamcast-exclusive upgrade of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;), fallen Elder God Shinnok and his cohort Quan Chi invade Edenia, aided by the traitorous Edenian Tanya. When Quan Chi and his forces later leave the realm to focus on attacking thunder god Raiden and the Earth heroes, Kitana escapes to aid her allies in defeating Shinnok. With Edenia freed once again, Kitana offers Liu Kang the chance to rule Edenia by her side, which he reluctantly rejects due to his duty as Earth&#x27;s champion. In a special-edition &quot;MK4&quot; comic book released with the 1998 PC version of the game, Kitana arranges peace between the warring Shokan and Centaurian races.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Kitana leads a preemptive strike against Shao Kahn&#x27;s forces, but Kahn is killed by unknown assassins later revealed as the titular Deadly Alliance of Quan Chi and Shang Tsung, who had formed an alliance to kill Kahn and Liu Kang before attempting to revive the mysterious Dragon King. Despite her grief, she leads the Earth warriors into an assault on Shang Tsung&#x27;s palace, where she faces Quan Chi but is outmatched and killed alongside her allies.

As a result of her death in the previous game, Kitana is unplayable in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), in which she and her slain companions are resurrected and controlled by the game&#x27;s final boss, the Dragon King Onaga, who additionally uses her to defeat and imprison Sindel and then install Mileena to pose as Kitana. However, Jade frees Sindel before imprisoning Kitana, and together they flee to Outworld to figure out how to free Kitana from Onaga&#x27;s influence. Meanwhile, Liu Kang&#x27;s spirit is able to remain amongst the living after his murder, and he enlists the reformed ninja Ermac to help him free Kitana and his friends from Onaga&#x27;s control, a mission in which they are successful.

In the spinoff game &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; (2005), after Kitana was found to be no longer loyal to Shao Kahn, she was placed into a spell-induced trance and forced to fight the Earth heroes, Mileena, and Jade before being freed by the Shaolin warrior monks Liu Kang and Kung Lao. Eventually, Kitana slays Mileena.

Following this warning, Kitana returned in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), accompanied by Liu Kang&#x27;s spirit in order to keep him whole until she found a way to reunite him with his body. They later meet with Nightwolf, who offers to relieve Kitana of her burden by absorbing Liu Kang&#x27;s soul, allowing her to fight against the coming evil. Kitana ultimately perishes alongside the rest of her allies during the battle.

In the non-canonical crossover game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot; (2008), Kitana was transported to Metropolis, where she encountered Wonder Woman. As she was suffering from &quot;kombat rage&quot; at the time, Kitana hallucinated Wonder Woman as an assassin sent from Outworld and challenged her. After being defeated, Kitana fled to a different section of Metropolis, where she was found and defeated by Scorpion and brought to Raiden&#x27;s temple, where she reveals she had a vision of Darkseid to become Dark Kahn. Following this, Kitana joined the rest of the combatants in traveling to the fused realms of Outworld and Apokolips and fighting the DC Universe&#x27;s heroes and villains while Raiden and Superman destroyed Dark Kahn.

In the rebooted timeline of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), which retells the events of the first three &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games, Shao Kahn sends her and Jade to participate in a Mortal Kombat tournament. Kitana tries to defeat Liu Kang, but ends up being defeated. Anticipating her death, she is shocked by his choice to let her live. In the second tournament, Raiden approaches Kitana and reveals that her belief that she is Shao Kahn&#x27;s daughter is false. Riddled with uncertainty, she secretly entered Shang Tsung&#x27;s flesh pits and came across the recently made Mileena. Prior to meeting Kahn, she blames Shang Tsung for replacing her, only to be surprised by the revelation that the Emperor was the one who created Mileena. Before carrying out the execution, he locks Kitana in the palace and demands for his real daughter to be brought to him. Liu Kang quickly helps Kitana to be liberated, and they, along with Jade, flee to Earth to team up with their new comrades in the fight against Outworld&#x27;s army. They help in the fight for Earth, but are slain by Kitana&#x27;s evil mother, Sindel, along with other warriors. Ultimately, it is revealed that she is among the fighters brought back to life by Quan Chi in the Netherrealm to fight against Raiden.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015) Kitana returns as one of Quan Chi&#x27;s revenants. She fought Jax and Cassie Cage. Following Quan Chi&#x27;s death and Shinnok&#x27;s defeat, she and fellow revenant Liu Kang became the Netherrealm&#x27;s new rulers.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), Kitana&#x27;s revenant aligned herself with the keeper of time, Kronika. As a result of Kronika&#x27;s actions however, a past version of Kitana and Liu Kang were brought to the present. While he traveled to Earthrealm to find out more about what happened, she stayed in Outworld to find Shao Kahn, who had also been brought to the present. To aid the new Outworld emperor Kotal Kahn, Kitana forged alliances with Outworld&#x27;s disparate factions before leading them into battle against Shao Kahn; personally defeating and maiming him herself. Kotal, who had been crippled during the fight, appointed Kitana as the new Kahn of Outworld in recognition of her skills in combat. After Kronika kidnaps Liu Kang, Kitana and her Outworld army aided Earthrealm&#x27;s allied forces against Kronika&#x27;s army until Raiden merged himself with Liu Kang to become Fire God Liu Kang. As the rest of her allies fought off Kronika&#x27;s forces, Kitana joined Liu Kang in breaching Kronika&#x27;s keep. However, Kronika reverses time for everyone except Liu Kang, who faces her and his allies&#x27; revenants alone. In one of the game&#x27;s endings, Liu Kang defeats Kronika and is able to bring Kitana back to help him forge a new timeline. In the DLC story expansion &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Kitana was brought back to life by Fujin and Shang Tsung to join forces with Sindel in the battle against Kronika. Nevertheless, she was shocked to discover her mother&#x27;s real character when she was unable to prevent her from betraying Earth and Outworld.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;″s rebooted timeline, Mileena is biologically her older twin sister at birth and they have a steady relationship with each other as well as their mother, Sindel. Due to being slightly older, Mileena is set to inherit the throne, but her family fears her potential banishment from the throne due to her affliction with the Tarkat disease. They are initially deceived by Shang Tsung and General Shao into believing Earthrealm is plotting against them until Fire God Liu Kang and his allies expose their atrocities. Though they are reunited with their father, Jerrod, after he takes control of Ermac&#x27;s body, Sindel is killed shortly afterwards by her evil counterpart from Titan Shang Tsung&#x27;s timeline and passes the throne to Mileena. To defeat Titan Shang Tsung, Liu Kang brings over Kitana from an alternate timeline where she defeated Kronika and became a Titan, and they passionately embrace each other before recruiting more Titan allies to face off against the threat. After Titan Shang Tsung&#x27;s defeat, Titan Kitana returns to her own timeline, and the Kitana from Liu Kang&#x27;s timeline replaces Shao as the General of Outworld&#x27;s army while continuing to advise her sister.

===Other media===
Kitana had a brief appearance in a Midway-published &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; comic book prequel that was written and illustrated by series co-creator John Tobias and served to introduce the game&#x27;s new characters. She is a minor character in Malibu Comics&#x27; 1994-1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic book series, first appearing in the three-issue miniseries &quot;Goro: Prince of Pain&quot; (1994), joining other &quot;MKII&quot; characters in searching for Goro in Outworld. Kitana&#x27;s role in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Battlewave&quot; (1995) has her attempting to rebel against Shao Kahn. She was additionally the subject of the 1995 one-shot &quot;Kitana and Mileena: Sister Act&quot;, in which her background from the games is intact, except she is already an adult when Shao Kahn kills Jerrod and seizes the realm and then bewitches her into believing she is Kahn&#x27;s daughter.
Kitana was a supporting character in the 1990s &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; feature films, unmasked throughout and portrayed by Talisa Soto. She is introduced as a companion of Shang Tsung and described only as his adversary due to her being the rightful heir of Outworld and thus a threat to his rule should she ally herself with the Earth fighters. Kitana eventually joins main protagonist Liu Kang and the Earthrealm heroes in defeating the sorcerer. The film&#x27;s producer Lauri Apelian commented that the two main female characters (Kitana and Sonya Blade, played by Bridgette Wilson) &quot;needed to have a strength and an independence and an intellect that went well beyond their beauty and being sexy.&quot; Kitana has a lesser role in the 1997 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, in which she is mostly kept in Shao Kahn&#x27;s captivity before being freed by Liu Kang. She joins the Earth heroes in their victorious final battle over Kahn&#x27;s forces. Soto underwent five weeks of martial arts training for the first film, and additionally learned Brazilian stick fighting for her use of the character&#x27;s steel fans in &quot;Annihilation&quot;. Kitana was not included in the 2021 feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, but will appear in the 2025 sequel played by Adeline Rudolph.

Kitana is a main character in the 1996 animated television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;, a loose adaptation of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. She was voiced by Cree Summer.

She appeared in three episodes of the 1998 syndicated live-action television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;, with the role split by Audie England and Dara Tomanovich. She is fully aware of her Edenian past and the deaths of her parents at Kahn&#x27;s hands but has no direct relation to Mileena.

Kitana was featured in a two-part episode of the 2011 web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, which combined live action and animated sequences. She was played by martial artist and stuntwoman Samantha Jo, in her acting debut. The episodes are another retelling of Kitana&#x27;s past from the games but with changes such as Sindel fusing her soul with Kitana&#x27;s in hopes to avoid Shao Kahn&#x27;s corruption before she commits suicide. When Mileena kills a man who is actually their father King Jerrod, Kitana learns the truth after her past and decides to turn against Shao Kahn in the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament. Jo reprised the role in one episode of the 2013 second season.

Kitana was voiced by Grey DeLisle in the animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (2020), featuring in a fight scene against Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat tournament. DeLisle reprised the role in the &quot;Legends&quot; sequel &quot;Battle of the Realms&quot; (2021), in which Kitana works alongside Kahn&#x27;s forces in invading Earth before rebelling against him and allying with the Earth fighters.

===Merchandise===
Action figures of Kitana were released in the UK by Toy Island in 1996, Mezco Toyz in 2015, and by Funko, as both a Funko Pop! vinyl figurine in 2017 and a traditional figure the following year. Syco Collectibles released a 1/6-scale limited-edition polystone Kitana statue in 2012, while Pop Culture Shock Collectibles released a 1/4-scale character statuette in 2013 and a 1/3-scale version in 2018. Other items included a character mousepad, a life-sized cardboard standee, and Halloween costumes.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Critical reception of Kitana has varied, often with emphasis placed on her good looks and sometimes on her relatively complicated personality. Ben Kendrick of Game Rant noted that &quot;apart from possessing one of the cooler weapons&quot; in the series, she &quot;lacks the entertaining/alluring oddity&quot; of her counterpart Mileena. &quot;GameFront&quot; opined the same year that Kitana has &quot;not [been] a very compelling character.&quot; Though she and Mileena were included in &quot;GamePro&quot;″s 2009 list of the seventeen best palette-swapped video game characters alongside the series&#x27; male ninjas, Dan Ryckert of &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote in 2010 that he did not want these characters, aside from Scorpion and Sub-Zero, in future series installments. Kitana&#x27;s &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; Fatality from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; has met with critical praise.

Response to Kitana&#x27;s alternate-media incarnations have been variably received. Laura Evenson of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted Talisa Soto&#x27;s attractiveness in the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film, but found her character otherwise uninteresting as compared to Robin Shou&#x27;s Liu Kang. Ben Steelman of the &quot;Star-News&quot; described her as &quot;basically Princess Leia in black leotards,&quot; but Jim Sterling of &quot;Destructoid&quot; noted Kitana&#x27;s &quot;more sensible makeover&quot; therein in contrast to her in-game designs. Michael Saunders of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote in his 1997 review of &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; that Soto &quot;never seems to do much more other than look exotic in the role.&quot; The 2011 &quot;Mortal Kombat Legacy&quot; first-season episode &quot;Kitana &amp; Mileena&quot; was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the category of &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Writing Derivative New Media&quot;.

===Sex appeal===
Kitana is considered a prominent sex symbol in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series, in a display of what one author described as manifestation of &quot;pseudo-Japanese Orientalist fetishes.&quot; According to Joey Esposito of MTV, &quot;it&#x27;s obvious that &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; added in some more, let’s say, sexually suggestive characters in Mileena and Kitana,&quot; Danny Gallagher of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Guy Code&quot; ranked Kitana among the &quot;best babes in video games&quot; of 2011, but commented that she had &quot;the deepest emotional core of any of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters.&quot; &quot;Den of Geek&quot; commented that &quot;Kitana became one of the breakout stars of the series&quot; upon her &quot;MKII&quot; debut, &quot;easily having more meat on her character than Sonya ever did.&quot;

===Gender criticism and Fatalities===

There have been controversies and mixed or negative critical reception of the character. In 1994, she was one of the fighting game characters cited by Guy Aoki of &quot;AsianWeek&quot; as allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts. In the video game violence controversy themed book &quot;Interacting With Video&quot;, Patricia Marks Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking used the &quot;two Asian twin sisters, Kitana and Mileena&quot; as an example of &quot;highly eroticized Dragon Lady&quot; stereotyping in video games. When Marsha Kinder accused &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; of misogyny in its handling of female characters, she alleged that &quot;some of the most violent possibilities are against women,&quot; whose own &quot;fatality moves are highly eroticised.&quot; Patrick Sunnen&#x27;s book &quot;Making Sense of Video Games&quot; judged their portrayal as &quot;formidable female opponents&quot; to be potentially progressive, yet arguably made just to increase &quot;the sexist potential of the individual fights&quot;, and described Kitana&#x27;s Fatality of decapitation with a &quot;deceptively feminine razor-sharp fan&quot; to be castration-like. Chad Hunter of &quot;Complex&quot; chose Jade and Kitana to represent the &quot;women who fight&quot; stereotype in his 2012 list of the fifteen most stereotypical characters in video games, for being &quot;half-naked skanks who can fight, hurl lasers and perform aerobatic attacks while wearing thongs, high-heeled boots and keeping their giant breasts under scarves,&quot; claiming that this has caused &quot;female gamers [to] slide away from this series.&quot;

<text>The Gananoque River is a river in Leeds and Grenville United Counties in Eastern Ontario, Canada. The river is in the Atlantic Ocean drainage basin and is a left tributary of the Saint Lawrence River.

The name &quot;Gananoque&quot; has been spelled many different ways over the years and so has been assigned several different interpretations, including &quot;place of health&quot; or &quot;meeting place&quot;.

The &quot;Gananoque River Waterways Association&quot; was founded in 1963 to include &quot;...property owners, resort operators, fishermen, farmers, trappers and all other interested parties...&quot; for the purpose of getting together to &quot;Protect wild life, arrange for equitable water levels, facilitate navigation, maintain health standards through the purity of the water [and] confer with officials in regard to definite arrangements for maintaining and improving the waterway for everyone&#x27;s use.&quot;

==Course and watershed==

The Gananoque River begins at Gananoque Lake in incorporated Leeds and the Thousand Islands township. It flows south, passes through the community of Marble Rock, then turns southwest and reaches the community of Maple Grove. It heads again south, takes in the right tributary Mud Creek, passes under Ontario Highway 401, and enters the town of Gananoque. It then flows over the concrete dam for the Gananoque Generating Station, in service since 1939, and empties into the Saint Lawrence River where that river is part of the Thousand Islands region.

Originally the Gananoque watershed included waters south of the present day Rideau River / Cataraqui River watershed divide near Newboro, Ontario. Water from present day upper Cataraqui watershed lakes such as Birch, Canoe, Buck, Devil, Newboro, Clear, Indian, Benson, Opinicon and Sand flowed through the Jones Falls rapids to the White Fish River. That river flowed into Lower Beverley Lake and from there to the Gananoque River. The original native canoe route from the Ottawa River, via the Rideau River, went to the White Fish River and from there to the St. Lawrence River at Gananoque. This was due to the fact that a direct waterway connection to the Cataraqui River did not exist at that time.

This started to change c.1803 when brothers Lemuel and Carey Haskins built a timber dam and sawmill at White Fish Falls, near today&#x27;s Morton, Ontario. Their dam backed up the water from the White Fish River, overflowing the Cranberry Flood Plain and sending it to the Cataraqui River at the Round Tail (just north of today&#x27;s Upper Brewers Locks). By 1816 (perhaps as early as 1805-1807), the Haskins built a mill dam at the Round Tail in order to impound their escaping water. This flooded the Cataraqui Flood Plain by about 6 feet, making it navigable by canoe and allowing direct navigation to Kingston. When the Rideau Canal was built (1826-1832) Haskins&#x27; mill dam at White Fish Falls was replaced by a canal dam and weir (at the foot of today&#x27;s Morton Bay), and the dam at Round Tail replaced by a canal dam at Upper Brewers. The Rideau Canal dam at the foot of Morton Bay now diverts most of the flow to the Cataraqui River. Today&#x27;s slow flowing Morton Creek (partially flooded due to the dam at Lyndhurst, Ontario) is all that is left of the original White Fish River.

<doc id="971252" wikidata="Q262684" url="?curid=971252" title="Füssen">
<text>Füssen is a town in Bavaria, Germany, in the district of Ostallgäu, situated one kilometre from the Austrian border. The town is known for violin manufacturing and as the closest transportation hub for the Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau castles. As of , the town has a population of .

==History==

Füssen was settled in Roman times, on the Via Claudia Augusta, a road that leads southwards to northern Italy and northwards to Augusta Vindelicum (today&#x27;s Augsburg), the former regional capital of the Roman province Raetia. The original name of Füssen was &quot;Foetes&quot;, or &quot;Foetibus&quot; (inflected), which derives from Latin &quot;Fauces&quot;, meaning &quot;gorge&quot;, probably referring to the Lech gorge.
In Late Antiquity Füssen was the home of a part of the Legio III Italica, which was stationed there to guard the important trade route over the Alps.

Füssen later became the site of the &quot;Hohes Schloss&quot; (High Castle), the former summer residence of the prince-bishops of Augsburg. Below the Hohes Schloss is the Baroque complex of the former Benedictine monastery of St. Mang, whose history goes back to the 9th century. Füssen has Saint Mang (Magnus of Füssen) as its patron saint. He and his Benedictine brother Theodor were two monks from the Abbey of Saint Gall and are considered to be its founders, in addition to the Monastery of Kempten. Magnus&#x27; original burial place was in the small chapel he built. His bones were transferred to the crypt of the church built in 850. Around the year 950 all his bones disappeared.

The canting coat of arms, depicting a triskeles symbol (alluding to the German &quot;Füsse&quot; &quot;feet&quot;), is based on a city seal used in the early 14th century.
In 1745, the Treaty of Füssen was signed between the Electorate of Bavaria and Habsburg Austria, ending Bavaria&#x27;s participation in the War of the Austrian Succession.

During the 19th century, composer Richard Wagner used to come to Füssen by railway when he visited King Ludwig II of Bavaria.

===Recent history===
Since the 1950s the town has been familiar to travellers as the southern terminus of the Romantic Road.
Füssen was host to the 1988 World Junior Curling Championships.

==Geography==

Füssen is located on the banks of the Lech River, which flows into the Forggensee. The &quot;Forggensee&quot; is a man-made lake which was built to prevent flooding. It is the catchment area for all the melting snow in the spring, and is drained after the middle of October.
Füssen is above sea level, surrounded by mountains of the Ammergau Alps. The castles of Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau are located near the town. At latitude 47°34 N it is one of the southernmost towns in Germany, at roughly the same latitude as Seattle, Washington, United States.


==Attractions==
The High Castle houses a branch gallery of the Bavarian State Collections of Paintings, which focuses on late Gothic and Renaissance works of art.

The oldest fresco in Germany can be found in the crypt of St Mang&#x27;s Basilica. It dates back to about the year 980.

St Mang&#x27;s Feast Day (6 September) is commemorated with a Holy Mass followed by a procession by torchlight through the old part of the city. During the week of the Saint&#x27;s Feast a special &#x27;Magnus Wine&#x27; is sold, with only 500 bottles produced.

Known beyond Füssen is the success of EV Füssen, the local Oberliga ice hockey club.

The Musiktheater Füssen is close to the lake Forggensee.

<text>Sixth Avenue, also known as Avenue of the Americas, is a major thoroughfare in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The avenue is commercial for much of its length, and traffic runs northbound, or uptown.

Sixth Avenue begins four blocks below Canal Street, at Franklin Street in Tribeca, where the northbound Church Street divides into Sixth Avenue to the left and the local continuation of Church Street to the right, which then ends at Canal Street. From this beginning, Sixth Avenue traverses SoHo and Greenwich Village, roughly divides Chelsea from the Flatiron District and NoMad, passes through the Garment District and skirts the edge of the Theater District while passing through Midtown Manhattan. Although it is officially named &quot;Avenue of the Americas&quot;, this name is seldom used by New Yorkers.

Sixth Avenue&#x27;s northern end is at Central Park South, adjacent to the Artists&#x27; Gate entrance to Central Park via Center Drive. Historically, Sixth Avenue was also the name of the road that continued north of Central Park, but that segment was renamed Lenox Avenue in 1887 and co-named Malcolm X Boulevard in 1987.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Sixth Avenue was laid out in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. As originally designed, Sixth Avenue&#x27;s southern terminus was at Carmine Street in Greenwich Village, and it continued northward to 147th Street in Harlem. Central Park was added to the street grid in 1857 and created an interruption in Sixth Avenue between 59th and 110th Streets. Proposals to extend the street south of Carmine Street were discussed by the city&#x27;s Board of Aldermen as early as the mid-1860s. The IRT Sixth Avenue Line elevated railway (the &quot;El&quot;) was constructed on Sixth Avenue in 1878, darkening the street and reducing its real-estate value. In the early and mid-1800s Sixth Avenue passed by the popular roadhouse and tavern, Old Grapevine, at the corner of 11th Street, which at the time was the northern edge of the city.

In late 1887, the Harlem portion of what was then considered Sixth Avenue was renamed Lenox Avenue for philanthropist James Lenox; a century later it was co-named Malcolm X Boulevard, in honor of the slain civil rights leader Malcolm X.

=== Early 20th century ===
Starting in 1926, as part of the construction of the Holland Tunnel, Sixth Avenue was widened and extended from Minetta Lane to Canal Street. Smaller side streets in the extension&#x27;s path were also demolished or incorporated into the extended avenue. The Sixth Avenue extension also allowed for the construction of the Independent Subway System (IND)&#x27;s Eighth Avenue Line, which was to run below Sixth Avenue south of Eighth Street. To accommodate the new subway, buildings were condemned and demolished to extend Sixth Avenue southward. Construction of the extension resulted in considerable dislocation to existing residents, as ten thousand people were evicted to make way for the Sixth Avenue extension. One historian stated that most of the displaced residents were &quot;Italian immigrants who knew no other home in America&quot;. According to the &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot;, the extension resulted in blank side walls facing the &quot;uninspiring thoroughfare&quot; and small leftover spaces. Dozens of buildings, including the original Church of Our Lady of Pompeii, were demolished. After the renumbering of the street&#x27;s properties in 1929, the Sixth Avenue extension was opened to traffic in 1930, and the subway line was completed two years later. Sixth Avenue, the only numbered avenue to extend south of Houston Street, thus became the southernmost numbered avenue in Manhattan. House numbering of existing buildings was adjusted.

=== Mid-20th century ===
By the 1930s, a coalition of commercial establishments and building owners along Sixth Avenue campaigned to have the El removed. The El was closed on December 4, 1938, and came down in stages, beginning in Greenwich Village in 1938–39. The replacement Sixth Avenue subway, which ran between Houston and 53rd Streets with a transfer to the Eighth Avenue line at West Fourth Street, opened in 1940.

The demolition of the Sixth Avenue elevated railway also resulted in accelerated commercial development of the avenue in Midtown. Beginning in the 1960s, the avenue was entirely rebuilt above 42nd Street as an all-but-uninterrupted avenue of corporate headquarters housed in glass slab towers of International Modernist style. Among the buildings constructed was the CBS Building at 52nd Street, by Eero Saarinen (1965), dubbed &quot;Black Rock&quot; for its full-height black-granite piers; this designated landmark is Saarinen&#x27;s only skyscraper. Another group of modernist structures along Sixth Avenue in midtown was the &quot;XYZ Buildings&quot; (1971–1974) at 1211, 1221, and 1251 Sixth Avenue.

On March 10, 1957, Sixth Avenue was reconfigured to carry one-way traffic north of its intersection with Broadway in Herald Square. The rest of the avenue followed on November 10, 1963.

==== Renaming and co-naming ====
The avenue&#x27;s official name was changed to Avenue of the Americas in 1945 by the City Council, at the behest of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who signed the bill into law on October 2, 1945. The intent was to honor &quot;Pan-American ideals and principles&quot; and the nations of Central and South America, and to encourage those countries to build consulates along the avenue. It was felt at the time that the name would provide greater grandeur to a shabby street and promote trade with the Western Hemisphere.

After the name change, round signs were attached to streetlights on the avenue, showing the national seals and coats of arms of the nations honored. However, New Yorkers rarely used the avenue&#x27;s newer name, and in 1955, an informal study found that locals used &quot;Sixth Avenue&quot; more than eight times as often as &quot;Avenue of the Americas&quot;. The move was criticized as &quot;propaganda&quot; by those who wanted to return to the original name. Most of the old round signs with country emblems were gone by the late 1990s, and the ones remaining, which were only present between Canal Street and Washington Place in Greenwich Village and in Midtown around 57th Street began showing signs of age. However, starting in March 2023, the city began to install new signs along most of the length of the avenue, in addition to replacing the remaining original signs.

=== Late 20th century to present ===
In the mid-1970s, the city &quot;spruced up&quot; the street, including the addition of patterned brick crosswalks, repainting of streetlamps, and new pedestrian plazas. Special lighting, rare throughout the rest of the city, was also installed. The administration of Mayor Ed Koch added a protected bike lane to Sixth Avenue between Eighth Street/Greenwich Avenue and Central Park South; the lane carried 200 cyclists an hour at peak times. The barriers between the bike lane and the vehicular lanes were removed in November 1980.

Manhattan Community Board 2 voted in 2014 to request a feasibility study for a protected bike lane on Sixth Avenue. The protected bike lane between 35th Street and Central Park South was reinstated in October 2020, following advocacy from cyclists. At the time, Sixth Avenue had two discontinuous segments of bike lanes, separated by a 20-block stretch with no bike lane. The southern segment ran from Franklin Street to Canal Street, while the northern segment ran from Eighth Street to Central Park South. Community Board 2 was reviewing plans for a protected bike lane from Lispenard Street (just south of Canal Street) to Eighth Street by mid-2024, and plans for a bike lane between these two intersections were announced in October 2024. The same month, as part of a reconstruction of the parallel Fifth Avenue in Midtown, Mayor Eric Adams proposed widening Sixth Avenue&#x27;s bike lane for two-way bike traffic.

==Notable buildings and events==

Sights along Sixth Avenue include Juan Pablo Duarte Square; the polychrome High Victorian Gothic Jefferson Market Courthouse, currently occupied by the Jefferson Market Library; the surviving stretch of grand department stores of 1880 to 1900 in the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District that runs from 18th Street to 23rd Street; the former wholesale flower district; Herald Square at 34th Street, site of Macy&#x27;s department store; and Bryant Park from 40th to 42nd Streets. The corporate stretch above 42nd Street contains the Bank of America Tower, W. R. Grace Building, International Center of Photography, Rockefeller Center (including the Time-Life Building, News Corp. Building, Exxon Building, McGraw-Hill Building, and Radio City Music Hall) and the CBS Building.

Sixth Avenue is the site of the annual Village Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village and the Dominican Day Parade in Midtown.

==Mass transit==
Sixth Avenue is served by the New York City Subway with the IND Sixth Avenue Line () north of Houston Street, and the IND Eighth Avenue Line () south of Greenwich Avenue. The Harlem portion of Sixth Avenue (Lenox Avenue) is served by the IRT Lenox Avenue Line () north of Central Park North (110th Street). The PATH&#x27;s Uptown Hudson Tubes to New Jersey also run under Sixth Avenue (JSQ–33, HOB-33, and JSQ-33 (via HOB) trains) from 9th to 33rd Streets.

The runs south of West 44th Street, where it terminates, while the run north of West 31st and West 14th Streets, respectively. The latter begins Harlem service at West 16th Street and uses 7th Avenue downtown; the rest use 5th Avenue. Additional service is provided by the eastbound from Spring to West Houston Streets.

==In popular culture==
The avenue is referenced both in the name and in the lyrics of &quot;6th Avenue Heartache&quot; by The Wallflowers.

<text>Lumbfoot or Lumb Foot is a hamlet in the Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury civil parish, and the City of Bradford metropolitan district, England. It is situated approximately from Haworth and less than half a mile north-east from Stanbury. The hamlet is historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. Lumbfoot overlooks a number of fields and a small brook, and contains 15 households and a farm. There is no public road; access is by a private road for vehicles, and a public footpath.

== History ==

Lumbfoot Mill, built on the floor of a valley, was originally water powered but adopted steam power in . The mill has since been largely demolished but a 15-foot stump of the chimney and the engine house still remain, and there is evidence of the pit that housed the original waterwheel among the ruins. A row of cottages at Lumbfoot, which today are modernised, were constructed between 1840 and 1852 to house mill workers.

<doc id="971273" wikidata="Q4774172" url="?curid=971273" title="Anti-Federalist League">
<text>The Anti-Federalist League (AFL) was a small cross-party organisation in the United Kingdom, formed in 1991 to campaign against the Maastricht Treaty. It is mainly remembered now as the forerunner of the UK Independence Party and its subsequent successor, the Brexit Party.

The main founder of the Anti-Federalist League was Alan Sked, lecturer at the London School of Economics, leading figure in the Bruges Group and former official of the Liberal Party. The Maastricht Treaty, which greatly increased the powers of the European Commission, was widely unpopular according to opinion polls, but all three of the main parties had pledged to support its ratification in the House of Commons. Sked and others felt that this denied voters a say on a crucial constitutional issue. Running AFL candidates was supposed to make good this shortfall in the democratic process. Another founder was Helen Szamuely. Members of the League included future UKIP leaders Nigel Farage (who was previously a member of the Conservative Party, like many of the other early UKIP/AFL members) and Gerard Batten.

The League stood seventeen candidates in the 1992 general election, but failed to make any impact or attract any press attention. It lost all its deposits. The following year, Alan Sked represented it in by-elections in Newbury (gaining 1% of the vote) and Christchurch (1.6%).

Amidst extraordinary scenes in the House of Commons, and in the teeth of intense opposition from a minority of Conservative MPs known as the Maastricht Rebels, the Maastricht Treaty finally passed into law. Many members of the Anti-Federalist League concluded that with the Treaty in place, the only option for anti-federalists was to campaign for complete British withdrawal from the European Union. To this end, Sked and others met in late 1993 to set up a full-blown political party: the UK Independence Party. Not all members of the League followed Sked into the new organisation, but the party did effectively supersede the League, which ceased to exist.

==Election results==
The League contested seventeen constituencies at the 1992 general election and Sked contested two by-elections in 1993.

===1992 United Kingdom general election===
The 1992 general election was held on Thursday 9 April 1992.

<doc id="971278" wikidata="Q837480" url="?curid=971278" title="Aspic">
<text>Aspic () or meat jelly is a savoury gelatin made with a meat stock or broth, set in a mold to encase other ingredients. These often include pieces of meat, seafood, vegetable, or eggs. Aspic is also sometimes referred to as &quot;aspic gelée&quot; or &quot;aspic jelly&quot;. In its simplest form, aspic is essentially a gelatinous version of conventional soup.

==History==

According to one poetic reference by Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, who described a version of a dish prepared with Iraqi carp, it was &quot;like ruby on the platter, set in a pearl ... steeped in saffron thus, like garnet it looks, vibrantly red, shimmering on silver&quot;.

Historically, meat aspics were made even before fruit- and vegetable-flavoured aspics. By the Middle Ages, cooks had discovered that a thickened meat broth could be made into a jelly. A detailed recipe for aspic is found in &quot;Le Viandier&quot;, written in or around 1375.

In the early 19th century, the French chef Marie-Antoine Carême created chaudfroid. The term &quot;chaudfroid&quot; means &quot;hot cold&quot; in French, referring to foods that were prepared hot and served cold. Aspic was used as a chaudfroid sauce in many cold fish and poultry meals, where it added moisture and flavour to the food. Carême also invented various types of aspic and ways of preparing it.

Aspic came into prominence in America in the early 20th century. By the 1950s, meat aspic was a popular dinner staple, as were other gelatin-based dishes such as tomato aspic. Cooks showed off their aesthetic skills by creating inventive aspics.

==Uses==
Aspic jelly may be colorless (white aspic) or contain various shades of amber. Aspic can be used to protect food from the air, to give food more flavor, or as a decoration. It can also be used to encase meats, preventing them from becoming spoiled. The gelatin keeps out air and bacteria, keeping the cooked meat or other ingredients fresh for longer. There are three types of aspic: delicate, sliceable, and inedible. The delicate aspic is soft. The sliceable aspic must be made in a terrine or in an aspic mold. It is firmer than the delicate aspic. The inedible aspic is never for consumption and is usually for decoration. Aspic is often used to glaze food pieces in food competitions to make the food glisten and make it more appealing to the eye. Foods dipped in aspic have a lacquered finish for a fancy presentation. Aspic can be cut into various shapes and be used as a garnish for deli meats or pâtés.

==Preparation==

The preparation of pork jelly includes placing lean pork meat, trotters, rind, ears, and snout in a pot of cold water and letting it cook over a slow fire for three hours. The broth is allowed to cool, while also removing any undesirable fats. Subsequently, white vinegar and the juice of half an orange or lemon can be added to the meat so that it is covered. The entire mixture is then allowed to cool and gel. Bay leaves or chili can be added to the broth for added taste (the Romanian variety is based on garlic and includes no vinegar, orange, lemon, chili, bay leaves, etc.). However, there are many alternate ways of preparing pork jelly, such as the usage of celery, beef and even pig bones. Poultry jellies are made the same way as making pork jelly, but less water is added to compensate for lower natural gelatin content.

Almost any type of food can be set into aspics, and almost any type of meat (poultry or fish included) can be used to make gelatin, although in some cases, additional gelatin may be needed for the aspic to set properly. Stock can be clarified with egg whites and then filled and flavored just before the aspic sets. The most common are pieces of meat, seafood, eggs, fruits, or vegetables. Veal stock (in particular, stock from a boiled calf&#x27;s foot) provides a great deal of gelatin, so other types of meat are often included when making stock.

Fish consommés usually have too little natural gelatin, so fish stock may be double-cooked or supplemented. Since fish gelatin melts at a lower temperature than the gelatins of other meats, fish aspic is more delicate and melts more readily in the mouth. Most fish stocks usually do not maintain a molded shape with their natural gelatin alone, so additional gelatin is added.

Vegetables have no natural gelatin. However, pectin serves a similar purpose in culinary applications such as jams and jellies.

==Global variations of aspic==

===Pork jelly===
Pork jelly is an aspic made from low-grade cuts of pig meat, such as trotters, that contain a significant proportion of connective tissue. Pork jelly is a popular appetizer and, nowadays, is sometimes prepared in a more modern version using lean meat, with or without pig leftovers (which are substituted with store-bought gelatin).

The dish is part of winter holiday celebrations such as the traditional Russian New Year (&quot;novy god&quot;) or Christmas meal. However, modern refrigeration allows for its year-round production, and it is not uncommon to see on a Russian table in summer.

 is usually made by boiling the bones and meat rich in collagen for about 5–8 hours to produce a thick and fatty broth, with the collagen hydrolizing into the natural gelatin, mixed with salt, pepper, and other spices. The meat is then separated from the bones, minced, recombined with the broth, dressed with the slices of boiled egg and herbs like parsley and cooled until it solidifies into a jelly. is usually eaten with or mustard.

===Belgium===
&quot;Rog in &#x27;t zuur&quot; or &quot;rog in zure gelei&quot; is a Flemish traditional recipe to preserve ray wings which are otherwise notoriously quick to spoil. Ray wings are poached in a fish stock with vinegar, spices and onions, then preserved by adding gelatin to the stock and covering the fish with the gelatin stock.

The upper layer, about half an inch thick, is &#x27;pigskin aspic&#x27;, while the lower layer is half red and half white, made from boiling pig&#x27;s trotter and pigskin until gelled, forming &#x27;meat aspic&#x27;. The traditional method of preparing the dish involves boiling the trotter with Saltpeter, resulting in a crimson hue. However, due to the use of saltpeter in food being banned, the modern approach is using German pork knuckles.
===Vietnam===

Giò thủ, giò tai, also known by another popular name giò xào, is one of the traditional Vietnamese sausage dishes with the main ingredient being stir-fried meat with some other ingredients, then wrapped and compressed. Originating in Northern Vietnam and now popular throughout the country, more or less similar forms of preparation like this dish also exist in many other cuisines around the world. The processing process is relatively easy, the ingredients are easy to find, and the finished product is delicious and strangely chewy, making spring rolls a familiar dish of people all over the region. Giò thủ is often made by families during the traditional Lunar New Year, and is sold at sausage shops in Vietnam most markets nationwide.

A more accurate variants of aspic in Vietnamese is called Thịt đông, or Vietnamese pork aspic.

== Health benefits ==

Aspic is a source of various nutrients like iron, vitamin A, vitamin K, fatty acids, selenium, zinc, magnesium and phosphorus.

An amino acid called glutamine in aspic may enhance the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which may be beneficial for inflammatory bowel disease and other digestive problems.

Glycine from aspic can improve sleep and reduce fatigue during the day.

<text>Sonning (traditional: ; modern: ) is a village and civil parish in Berkshire, England, on the River Thames, east of Reading. The village was described by Jerome K. Jerome in his book &quot;Three Men in a Boat&quot; as &quot;the most fairy-like little nook on the whole river&quot;.

==Toponymy==
The place-name Sonning seems to contain an Old English personal name, &quot;Sunna&quot;, + &quot; ingas&quot; (Old English), &#x27;The village of the people of . . .&#x27; ; &#x27;the village of the people called after . . .&#x27;, so probably, &#x27;homestead/village of Sunna&#x27;s people&#x27;, the Sunningas. Sonning appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Soninges&quot;.

==Geography==
The parish of Sonning originally included Charvil, Woodley and Earley and, before the formation of civil parishes in 1866, was a cross-county-boundary parish containing Sonning Eye, Dunsden Green and Playhatch in Oxfordshire as well. It is now much smaller and triangular shaped. The ecclesiastical parish of Sonning continues to include Sonning, Charvil and Sonning Eye. The northwestern boundary is formed by the River Thames before passing through the middle of the Thames Valley Park. The southern border follows the railway line. The northeastern boundary travels over Charvil Hill and follows the edge of the housing at Charvil itself until it reaches the confluence of St Patrick&#x27;s Stream with the Thames, near St Patrick&#x27;s Bridge. The northern corner of the parish consists of very low-lying land adjoining the river.

The Sonning Golf Course sits in the southeast corner, with Holme Park, Sonning Hill and the business park in the southwest, and the village roughly in the middle. Sonning village is at a crossing point of the River Thames, where the narrow arched Sonning Bridge on the B478 crosses the river to the hamlet of Sonning Eye on the Oxfordshire bank. Just upstream of the bridge is Sonning Lock. The old village is now joined to further housing along Pound Lane and the A4 Bath Road. It lies some east of the major town of Reading. In other directions, this would put it within the Reading suburban sprawl, but Sonning remains a clearly delineated small village. Most of the village together with the grounds of Reading Blue Coat School forms a Conservation Area.

==History==
In Anglo-Saxon times, the village was of considerable importance as the lesser centre of the bishopric of Ramsbury, sometimes called the see of Ramsbury and Sonning. The church was a secondary cathedral and the present structure, St Andrew&#x27;s Church, contains reused Anglo-Saxon carvings. By the 12th century Sonning church had eight dependent churches, four of which had become independent parishes by the 15th century. This is an example of the organisation of the Anglo-Saxon church into minsters with their own parochially known as the minster system.

Sonning prospered as an important stopping post for travellers, both by road and by boat. There were a number of ancient hostelries where they could have stayed, notably the Great House on the site of the original ferryman&#x27;s cottage. The Bull Inn had the added bonus of being near the church where pilgrims could venerate a relic of Saint Cyriacus. The Bishops of Salisbury succeeded those of Ramsbury and Sonning and had a bishop&#x27;s palace in the village until the 16th century. King Richard II&#x27;s young bride, Queen Isabella of Valois, was kept captive here during his imprisonment and deposition. Aberlash House is a Grade II listed house situated on an island in the River Thames at Sonning. It was originally built in the 17th century and, like much of the village, was formerly owned by the Rich family, Lords of the Manor of Sonning, although they did not live there.

The Great Western Railway passes about south of the village, in a long cutting, Sonning Cutting. It was opened in 1840, and was the scene of one of the first railway disasters in 1841, when a mixed passenger and goods train ran into a landslip. Nine passengers died in the accident, being thrown from the open trucks just behind the engine. Many were stonemasons working on the Houses of Parliament, and the disaster led to changes in the Railways Act, which required that third-class passengers be carried in stoutly constructed carriages rather than open trucks. The Act also created Parliamentary trains for third-class passengers.

Just outside the village, above Sonning Lock, is the independent secondary school, Reading Blue Coat School, in the 19th century manor house, Holme Park. Built in the home park of the old palace, it replaced a Georgian mansion erected for the Lords of the Manor who eventually superseded the bishops. The first of these was Laurence Halstead, partner to the Reading cloth merchant, John Kendrick. In the early 20th century, a second country house was built in the village, the Deanery Garden. It provides a fine example of an Edwin Lutyens house with a Gertrude Jekyll garden, originally designed as a show house for the founder of &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine.

==Transport==
The main road through Sonning is the B478, running from the Bridge to the Charvil roundabout on the A4. The B4446 runs north from the A4 to the village. The A4 itself passes through the south of the parish, as does the Great Western Main Line, though there is no station. On the Thames, there are moorings both above and below Sonning Lock, as well as in the weir stream.
==Local government==
Sonning is a civil parish with an elected parish council of nine councillors. It falls within the area of the unitary authority of Wokingham. The parish council and the unitary authority are responsible for different aspects of local government.

===Twinning===
Sonning is twinned with Ligugé, France. The village has an active twinning association and the lane to the village primary school is called Ligugé Way.

==Media==
&quot;Sonning Parish Magazine&quot;, established in 1869, serves Sonning and the neighbouring village of Charvil.

==Sport and leisure==
Sonning has a King George&#x27;s Field in memorial to George V, where Sonning Cricket Club plays. There are playing fields between Sonning and the main A4 road, including hockey and rugby fields. Sonning Hockey Club, Reading Hockey Club, Reading R.F.C., and Berkshire Shire Hall R.F.C. can all be found on Sonning Lane. Sonning Hockey Club was the first club in the county of Berkshire to be awarded &quot;Club 1st National Hockey Accreditation&quot; for junior coaching and development. The club also has squash courts and tennis courts.

Rams RFC is nearby, off the Old Bath Road. Sonning Golf Club is on the other side of the A4 road. Sonning Regatta restarted in 2000 and is held every two years just upstream from Sonning Lock. There is sailing and waterskiing on the Caversham Lakes across the Thames and the Redgrave Pinsent Rowing Lake has recently been created there as well.

The Sonning Village Show, started in the 1960s by the local Women&#x27;s Institute, is held every September at the village primary school.

<doc id="971289" wikidata="Q2742549" url="?curid=971289" title="Dropsonde">
<text>A dropsonde is an expendable weather reconnaissance device created by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude over water to measure (and therefore track) storm conditions as the device falls to the surface. The sonde contains a GPS receiver, along with pressure, temperature, and humidity (PTH) sensors to capture atmospheric profiles and thermodynamic data. It typically relays this data to a computer in the aircraft by radio transmission.

== Usage ==

Dropsonde instruments are typically the only current method to measure the winds and barometric pressure through the atmosphere and down to the sea surface within the core of tropical cyclones far from land-based weather radar. The data obtained is usually fed via radio into supercomputers for numerical weather prediction, enabling forecasters to better predict the effects and intensity, based on computer-generated models using data gathered from previous storms under similar conditions. This helps meteorologists to more reliably establish a storm&#x27;s potential damage, based on those factors. 

Since the early 1970s, United States Air Force Reserves Hurricane Hunters of the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron based at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi, have employed dropsondes while flying over the ocean to obtain meteorological data on the structure of hurricanes deemed to be of possible concern to coastal and inland locations in the northern Atlantic ocean, northeastern Pacific ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico. During a typical hurricane season, Hurricane Hunters deploys 1,000 to 1,500 sondes on training and storm missions.

Aircraft reconnaissance missions are also sometimes requested to investigate the broader atmospheric structure over the ocean when cyclones may pose a significant threat to the United States. These interests include not only potential hurricanes, but also possible snow events (like nor&#x27;easters) or significant tornado outbreaks. The dropsondes are used to supplement the large gaps over oceans within the global network of daily radiosonde launches. Typically satellite data provides an estimate of conditions in such areas, but the increased precision of sondes can improve forecasts, particularly of the storm path.

Dropsondes may also be employed during meteorological research projects.

== Device and launch details ==

The sonde is a lightweight system designed to be operated by one person and is launched through a chute installed in the measuring aircraft. The device&#x27;s descent is slowed and stabilized by a small square-cone parachute, allowing for more readings to be taken before it reaches the ocean surface. The parachute is designed to immediately deploy after release so as to reduce or eliminate any pendulum effect, and the device typically drops for three to five minutes. The sonde has a casing of stiff cardboard to protect electronics and form a more stable aerodynamic profile.

To obtain data in a tropical cyclone, an aircraft (in the US, operated either by NOAA or the U.S. Air Force) flies into the system. A series of dropsondes are typically released as the plane passes through the storm, typically launched with greatest frequency near the center of the storm, including into the eyewall and eye (center), if one exists. Most drops are performed at a flight level of around 10,000 feet (approx. 3,000 meters).

The dropsonde sends back coded data, which includes:
# The date and time of the drop. Time is always in UTC.
# Location of the drop, indicated by the latitude, longitude, and Marsden square.
# The height, temperature, dewpoint depression, wind speed, and wind direction recorded at any standard isobaric surfaces encountered as the dropsonde descends, which are from the set of: 1000, 925, 850, 700, 500, 400, 300, 250 hectopascals (hPa), and at the sea surface.
# The temperature and dewpoint depression at all other atmospheric pressure deemed significant due to important changes or values in the atmospheric conditions found
# Air pressure, temperature, dewpoint depression, wind speed and wind direction of the tropopause.

Also included in the report is information on the aircraft, the mission, the dropsonde itself, and other remarks.

==Driftsondes==
A driftsonde is a high altitude, durable weather balloon holding a transmitter and a bank (35 in the first models) of miniature dropsonde capsules which can then be dropped at automatic intervals or remotely. The water-bottle-sized transmitters in the dropsondes have enough power to send information to the balloon during their parachute-controlled fall. The balloon carries a larger transmitter powerful enough to relay readings to a satellite. The single-use sensor packages cost US$300 to $400 each.

After being introduced in April 2007, around a thousand a year are expected to be used to track winds in hurricane breeding grounds off of West Africa, which are outside the operating region of hurricane hunter planes.

<doc id="971296" wikidata="Q6253359" url="?curid=971296" title="John Prescott Ellis">
<text>John Prescott Ellis (born February 3, 1953) is an American former journalist and media consultant, and is now a partner in the venture-capital firm Sand Hills Partners. He is a nephew of former President of the United States George H. W. Bush and a first cousin of former President George W. Bush and former Governor of Florida John Ellis &quot;Jeb&quot; Bush.

==Family background &amp; private life==
Ellis&#x27;s father was Alexander B. &quot;Sandy&quot; Ellis, an insurance executive in Boston, who studied at Yale University. His mother was Nancy Walker Bush Ellis, a sister of former President George H. W. Bush. His siblings include former Denver Broncos CEO Joe Ellis and Alexander Ellis III. Both his father Sandy Ellis and uncle George H. W. Bush were members of Skull and Bones at Yale. Ellis himself also attended Yale University, graduating in 1976. 

Ellis is married and has two children with his wife Susan Smith Ellis, an former executive for Omnicom Group and CEO of (RED). They live near the Hudson River.

==Career==
In 1978, Ellis started working for NBC as a consultant. He then worked on his uncle George H. W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1979, and later returned to NBC, where he worked for the elections unit until 1989. He was the Appleman Fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard’s JFK School of Government in 1989, then a Senior Fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics beginning in 1991. From 1994 to 1999 he was a columnist for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. In 1998 he took a position with Fox News Channel as head of the Election Night decision desk. 

=== Election Night 2000 ===

==== Fox News Florida call ====
On the night of the 2000 U.S. presidential election Ellis was working as a consultant for Fox News, serving as the head of Fox News&#x27;s Election Night decision desk, where he analyzed data from the Voter News Service. Fox News was the first (at 2:16 am ET) to call Florida for Bush, with other networks following shortly thereafter. The call occurred during a temporary lead for Bush due to the Volusia error. After the election, journalists including &quot;The Washington Posts&quot; Howard Kurtz alleged that Ellis had called the election for his cousin, George W. Bush. 

==== Bush campaign phone calls ====
According to an interview Ellis gave to Jane Mayer of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in 2000, he was responsible for Fox News&#x27;s decisions in calling states for Gore or Bush based on statistical results from the VNS data. Ellis also admitted sharing exit-poll data with his cousins by phone. After the interview was published, Fox News Vice President John Moody admitted that Ellis had broken rules by sharing the data and said he was considering disciplinary action. In the interview Ellis stated that he relayed early vote counts the Bush campaign in Austin. Ellis later provided &quot;CBS News&quot; with a copy of a letter he claimed he sent &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In the letter, Ellis states that he did not share information with the campaign during two afternoon phone calls. It further states that later in the evening &quot;as actual vote results&quot; came in, Ellis spoke frequently with the Bushes about &quot;what was happening&quot; in several states. According to Ellis, other workers on the decision desk – &quot;most of whom are registered Democrats&quot; – were talking to the Gore campaign. Ellis says that he was ultra-scrupulous because of his relationship. &quot;We obeyed those [rules] more strictly than any other news organization, precisely because my cousin was running for president,&quot; Ellis told &quot;USA Today&quot;.

This controversy was picked up by, among others, Michael Moore in his 2004 film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.

=== Recent career ===
From 2002 to 2006 he was a contributing columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. In 2002 Ellis began working as a Senior Fellow at the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. In 2005, President Bush awarded his cousin Ellis the Outstanding Civilian Service Award. In the last few years Ellis has worked in investment banking and is a partner in Kerr Creek Partners, and also is a contributing columnist to Real Clear Politics as well as his own political blog called &quot;Ellisblog!&quot;. In 2011, Ellis became editor of the &quot;Politix&quot; section of Business Insider, focusing on the intersection of the business world and politics. During the 2012 United States presidential election Ellis worked as a contributing opinion editor at BuzzFeed News. In 2021, Ellis hosted the &quot;News Items Podcast&quot; with co-host Rebecca Darst, produced by &quot;The Recount&quot;.

<doc id="971297" wikidata="Q1628" url="?curid=971297" title="David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter">
<text>David George Brownlow Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter, KCMG, KStJ (9 February 1905 – 21 October 1981), styled Lord Burghley before 1956 and also known as David Burghley, was an English athlete, sports official, peer, and Conservative Party politician. He won the gold medal in the 400 m hurdles at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Born near Stamford, Lincolnshire, as heir to the 5th Marquess of Exeter, Lord Burghley was educated at Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland, Ludgrove School, Eton College and Magdalene College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he was president of the Cambridge University Athletics Club and a member of the Pitt Club.

==Athlete==

A notable runner at school and at Cambridge, he continued with his athletics and won the British AAA championships in 120 yd from 1929 to 1931 and the hurdles from 1926 to 1928, and again in 1930 and 1932.

Burghley made his Olympic debut in Paris in 1924, when he was eliminated in the first round of the 110 metre hurdles event. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Burghley was eliminated in the semifinal of the 110 metre hurdles competition, but won the 400 metres hurdles, beating second and third placed Americans Frank Cuhel and Morgan Taylor by 0.2 seconds. At the first Commonwealth Games in 1930, Burghley won both hurdling events and was also a member of the gold medal winning British 4×440 yards relay team. In 1927–1930 Burghley also set several British records, one of which, 24.7 s in the 220 yard hurdles, set in 1927, stood until 1950.

In 1931 Burghley was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Peterborough. He was granted a leave of absence to compete in the 1932 Summer Olympics, where he placed fourth in the 400 m hurdles event, fifth in the 110 m hurdles competition, and won a silver medal as a member of the British 4 × 400 metres relay team, which set a new European record in the process.

In 1933, Burghley became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Three years later he was elected President of the Amateur Athletic Association and Chairman of the British Olympic Association. In 1946 he became President of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) and later acted as Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the 1948 Summer Olympics. Between 1952 and 1966 he was vice-president of the IOC and was a presidential candidate in 1952 and 1964.

As an IOC member and president of the IAAF, Burghley presented the medals for the 200 m at the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and appeared in some famous images of the Black Power salute given by Tommie Smith and John Carlos. When later asked what he had thought of the gloves, he said: &quot;I thought they had hurt their hand.&quot;

==Politician==

Burghley was a member of the Conservative and Unionist Party and served as MP for Peterborough from 1931 until 1943. He was elected in the 1931 general election, defeating the sitting Labour MP J. F. Horrabin. Burghley was returned to the House of Commons in the 1935 general election. He was for many years Chairman of the Junior Imperial League. Burghley resigned his Commons seat in 1943 to take up appointment as Governor of Bermuda, a post in which he served until 1945.

==Family==

The Marquess of Exeter was a descendant of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, chief minister and, later, treasurer to Queen Elizabeth I. On his death the title passed to his brother, Lord Martin Cecil.

Lord Burghley married firstly on 10 January 1929, his second cousin, Lady Mary Theresa Montagu Douglas Scott (4 March 1904 – 1 June 1984), fourth daughter of John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch &amp; 9th Duke of Queensberry, and Lady Margaret Alice Bridgeman. They were cousins through their common descent from Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. They had four children before divorcing in 1946:

*Lady Davina Mary Cecil (29 June 1931 – 6 September 2018), married John Vane, 11th Baron Barnard on 8 October 1952. They divorced in 1993.
*Hon. John William Edward Cecil (1 June 1933 – 6 Jul 1934). 
*Lady Gillian Moyra Katherine Cecil (8 March 1935 - 17 June 2022), married Sir Giles Henry Charles Floyd, 7th Baronet on 23 November 1954. They divorced in 1978.
*Lady Angela Mary Rose Cecil (born 21 May 1938), CVO and former Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother; married Sir William Richard Michael Oswald on 21 April 1958.

He married secondly on 12 December 1946, Diana Mary Henderson (10 January 1911 – 6 June 1982), granddaughter of Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon, and widow of Lt.-Col. David Walter Arthur William Forbes. They had one daughter:

*Lady Victoria Diana Cecil (born 28 June 1947), married Simon Patrick Leatham on 25 April 1967.

==Great Court Run==
In June 1927, in his final year at Magdalene College, Cambridge, Burghley sprinted around Great Court at Trinity College at midnight in the time it took the college clock to toll 12 o&#x27;clock. This inspired the scene in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; in which Harold Abrahams accomplishes the same feat. The character Lord Andrew Lindsay in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, played by Nigel Havers, is based upon Burghley, but he did not allow his name to be used because of the inaccurate historical depiction in the film. There was never a race in which Abrahams beat Burghley in this feat as the film suggests; in fact, Abrahams never attempted the Great Court Run.

Burghley was the first to run the around the court in the 43.6 seconds that it takes the clock to strike 12 o&#x27;clock. Known as the Great Court Run, students traditionally attempted to complete the circuit on the night of the Matriculation Dinner. In modern times the run is attempted at noon.

<doc id="971298" wikidata="Q455240" url="?curid=971298" title="Diana King">
<text>Diana King (born 8 November 1970) is a Jamaican singer-songwriter who performs a mixture and fusion of reggae, reggae fusion and dancehall. They are best known for their hit 1995 single &quot;Shy Guy&quot; and their remake of &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

As of 1998, King has sold over five million records worldwide. Regarded as one of the most successful Jamaican artists, they have scored multiple &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 entries. King is also a recipient of the &quot;Vanguard Award&quot; at the Out Music Awards.

==Early life==
King was born to an Indo-Jamaican mother and an Afro-Jamaican father in Spanish Town.

==Career==
King was a member of the City Heat band, performing on the local hotel circuit before releasing their first solo single, &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, in 1991.

After making an appearance on The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s 1994 song &quot;Respect&quot;, from his album &quot;Ready to Die&quot;, they signed a recording contract with Sony Music. Their first release was a remake of the Bob Marley song &quot;Stir It Up&quot; (which peaked at no. 53 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop Songs chart) for the &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; soundtrack that same year.

King&#x27;s next single, &quot;Shy Guy&quot;, co-written and produced by Andy Marvel was released in 1995. The song, which only took them 10 minutes to write, became a hit, reaching No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and being certified gold by the RIAA in the U.S.; the single also hit No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as reaching No. 1 on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart, going on to sell nearly five million singles worldwide. &quot;Shy Guy&quot; was also ranked by the Japanese radio station J-Wave as the No. 1 song of 1995. In the UK, it had a place in the top 10 for seven weeks. It served as a single from the soundtrack to the 1995 film, &quot;Bad Boys&quot; in addition to being the lead release off their debut album &quot;Tougher Than Love&quot; which was released on 25 April 1995. The album peaked at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Reggae, No. 85 on R&amp;B, and No. 179 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. Two follow-up singles &quot;Love Triangle&quot; (No. 85 R&amp;B) and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; (No. 94 Pop, No. 63 R&amp;B) followed that same year. In 1996, King collaborated with Nahki on the single &quot;I&#x27;ll Do It&quot;. Also in 1996, their version of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot; was included on the soundtrack to the film &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;.

In 1997, King also scored another hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (No. 38) and the Hot Dance Club Play (No. 8) with their cover version of the song &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; (originally recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1967), which was featured on the soundtrack to the film, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Their second album &quot;Think Like a Girl&quot; was released on 30 September 1997, and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Reggae Albums chart at No. 1. The album spawned two more US singles with &quot;L-L-Lies&quot; and &quot;Find My Way Back&quot; in addition to &quot;Supa-Lova-Bwoy&quot; which was released exclusively in Japan. King was also featured on the 1997 soundtrack to the documentary &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, where they performed the title track with Brian McKnight.

In 1998, King joined Celine Dion and Brownstone on stage to perform the hit &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; previously written and recorded by King from &quot;Tougher Than Love&quot; at the Essence Awards. That year, they also appeared on &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;The RuPaul Show&quot;, and &quot;VIBE&quot; to promote &quot;Think Like a Girl&quot;. They also collaborated with artists such as Toots Hibbert, Ziggy Marley, Buju Banton, Ini Kamoze, Maxi Priest, Shaggy, Tony Rebel, I-Three, Brian Gold, Handel Tucker, Lowell &#x27;Sly&#x27; Dunbar &amp; Mikey Bennett on the charity single &quot;Rise Up&quot; with Jamaica United.

In 1999, they toured India doing a five city tour. From Goa, they said: &quot;I never thought I would come back to India.&quot;

King entered negotiations with Madonna&#x27;s Maverick Records label in 2000.

In 2002, King premiered their single, &quot;Summer Breezin&#x27;&quot; on BET and VH1 video outlets, and it received some urban radio airplay, their third album &quot;Respect&quot; was released on 24 July 2002 in Japan, with plans for other markets such as the US and Europe eventually cancelled. However, it finally received a release in other markets such as the UK on 17 April 2006 and the United States on 28 April 2008.

In 2006, they released the single &quot;Spanish Town Blues&quot; for a Taxi Records compilation album with Sly &amp; Robbie.

In 2007, King co-wrote and recorded the song &quot;The Light Within&quot; with the German reggae artist Gentleman, for his album &quot;Another Intensity&quot;. Additionally, they also collaborated with Sarah and Kid Capri for a single called &quot;Get Me @ This Party&quot;. Later that year, they formed their own record label, ThinkLikeAgirl.

In 2009, they collaborated with Richie Stephens on a remake of the ballad &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; for his album &quot;Forever&quot;.

In 2010, King&#x27;s record label ThinkLikeAgirL Music Inc. went through a licensing deal with Warner Music Japan with the release of their fourth album, &quot;Warrior Gurl&quot;. The album was released in Japan on 22 September 2010. It was led by the single &quot;Yu Dun Kno&quot; which was released that same year. They also recorded a track &quot;Bounce&quot; for another Taxi Records compilation album.

For the international release of the album, King renamed the album to &quot;AgirLnaMeKING&quot; and it was released on their birthday, 8 November 2012. Two more singles &quot;Closer&quot; and &quot;Jeanz N T-Shirt&quot; were released in 2012.

In 2016, King announced they were at work on an all-lesbian record label in addition to a new studio album and an EP. The full-length album was to be a reggae release, while the EP an EDM (electronic dance music) release.

==Personal life==
King was previously married to their tour manager Orville Aris, with whom they share a son, born in 1996.

In June 2012, King came out as a lesbian via Facebook, stating: &quot;I answer now, not because it&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s business but because it feels right with my soul and I believe by not answering or hiding it all these years somehow makes it appear as if I am ashamed of it or that I believe it is wrong.&quot; They have 15 siblings, but due to King coming out, they are now only close to one. King came out to themself in their 20s, but it took a decade for King to be comfortable with it publicly, for any backlash towards their daughter and son. King was honoured for their bravery on 16, December 2012 and was presented with the prestigious &quot;Vanguard Award&quot; at the Out Music Awards in Las Vegas. King is the first Jamaican artist to ever publicly come out.

In January 2018, King announced that they had married their long-time girlfriend, Jamaican violinist Mijanne Webster. On September 12, 2018 they announced via Twitter that they identified as non-binary. In 2020, King stated that they used &quot;he/him&quot;, &quot;she/her&quot;, and &quot;they/them&quot; pronouns, but in 2022, King changed their pronouns to exclusively use &quot;they/them&quot;.

In August 2021, they announced via Twitter the death of their daughter, Shalamar Diana Wright (1987-2021), who was born when King was sixteen. Mijanne also tweeted to commemorate Shalamar and thank her for accepting Mijanne as part of her family.

King holds both Jamaican and US citizenships.

<doc id="971305" wikidata="Q1981408" url="?curid=971305" title="Haemodynamic response">
<text>In haemodynamics, the body must respond to physical activities, external temperature, and other factors by homeostatically adjusting its blood flow to deliver nutrients such as oxygen and glucose to stressed tissues and allow them to function. Haemodynamic response (HR) allows the rapid delivery of blood to active neuronal tissues. The brain consumes large amounts of energy but does not have a reservoir of stored energy substrates. Since higher processes in the brain occur almost constantly, cerebral blood flow is essential for the maintenance of neurons, astrocytes, and other cells of the brain. The coupling between neuronal activity and blood flow is neurovascular coupling. 

==Vascular anatomy overview==
In order to understand how blood is delivered to cranial tissues, it is important to understand the vascular anatomy of the space itself. Large cerebral arteries in the brain split into smaller arterioles, also known as pial arteries. These consist of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, and as these pial arteries further branch and run deeper into the brain, they associate with glial cells, namely astrocytes. The intracerebral arterioles and capillaries are unlike systemic arterioles and capillaries in that they do not readily allow substances to diffuse through them; they are connected by tight junctions in order to form the blood brain barrier (BBB). Endothelial cells, smooth muscle, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes work together in the brain order to maintain the BBB while still delivering nutrients to tissues and adjusting blood flow in the intracranial space to maintain homeostasis. As they work as a functional neurovascular unit, alterations in their interactions at the cellular level can impair HR in the brain and lead to deviations in normal nervous function.

==Mechanisms==
Various cell types play a role in HR, including astrocytes, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells of blood vessels, and pericytes. These cells control whether the vessels are constricted or dilated, which dictates the amount of oxygen and glucose that is able to reach the neuronal tissue. 

===Astrocytes===
Astrocytes are unique in that they are intermediaries that lie between blood vessels and neurons. They are able to communicate with other astrocytes via gap junctions and have endfoot processes that interact with neuronal synapses. These processes have the ability to take up various neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine (NE) and glutamate, and perform various other functions to maintain chemical and electrical homeostasis in the neuronal environment.

Constriction has been shown &quot;in vitro&quot; to occur when NE is placed in the synapse and is taken up by astrocyte receptors. NE uptake leads to an increase in intracellular astrocyte Ca. When these calcium ion waves spread down the length of the astrocyte, phospholipase A (PLA) is activated which in turn mobilizes arachidonic acid. These two compounds are transported to the smooth muscle and there react with cytochrome P450 to make 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which acts through yet to-be-determined mechanisms to induce vasoconstriction. It has also been shown that agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also increase intracellular Ca to produce constriction.

===Smooth muscle===

Dilation occurs when nitric oxide (NO) is released from endothelial cells and diffuses into nearby vascular smooth muscle. Several proposed pathways of NO-induced vasodilation have been proposed through haemodynamic investigation. It has been shown that NO inhibits 20-HETE synthesis, which may interfere with astrocytes&#x27; constriction pathways and lead to vasodilation. It has also been proposed that NO may amplify astrocyte Ca influx and activate Ca-dependent potassium channels, releasing K into the interstitial space and inducing hyperpolarization of smooth muscle cells. In addition to this, it has already been shown that NO stimulates increased cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels in the smooth muscle cells, inducing a signaling cascade that results in the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and an ultimate decrease in smooth muscle Ca concentration. This leads to a decrease in muscle contraction and a subsequent dilation of the blood vessel. Whether the vessels are constricted or dilated dictates the amount of oxygen and glucose that is able to reach the neuronal tissue.

===Pericytes===

A principal function of pericytes is to interact with astrocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other intracranial cells to form the blood brain barrier and to modulate the size of blood vessels to ensure proper delivery and distribution of oxygen and nutrients to neuronal tissues. Pericytes have both cholinergic (α2) and adrenergic (β2) receptors. Stimulation of the latter leads to vessel relaxation, while stimulation of the cholinergic receptors leads to contraction.

Paracrine activity and oxygen availability have been shown to also modulate pericyte activity. The peptides angiotensin II and endothelin-1 (ET-1) bind to pericytes and are vasoactive. Endothelial cells induce expression of endothelin-1, which leads to NO production and vasodilation. Experiments have demonstrated that oxygen levels also alter pericyte contraction and subsequent blood vessel contraction. In vitro, high oxygen concentrations cause pericyte constriction, while high CO concentrations cause relaxation. This suggests that pericytes may have the ability to dilate blood vessels when oxygen is in demand and constrict them when it is in surplus, modifying the rate of blood flow to tissues depending on their metabolic activity.

==Complications==

The haemodynamic response is rapid delivery of blood to active neuronal tissue. Complications in this response arise in acute coronary syndromes and pulmonary arterial hypertension. These complications lead to a change in the regulation of blood flow to the brain, and in turn the amount of glucose and oxygen that is supplied to neurons, which may have serious effects not only on the functioning of the nervous system, but functioning of all bodily systems.

===Acute coronary syndrome===
Acute infections, such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), act as a trigger for acute coronary syndromes (ACS). ACS deals with symptoms that result from the obstruction of coronary arteries. Due to this obstruction there are thrombotic complications at the sites of atherosclerotic plaques. The most common symptom that prompts diagnosis is chest pain, associated with nausea and sweating. Treatment usually includes aspirin, Clopidogrel, nitroglycerin, and if chest pain persists morphine. Recent study suggests that acute respiratory tract infection can act as a trigger for ACS. This in turn has major prothrombotic and haemodynamic effects.

These effects result from coagulation, which is normally prevented in the vascular endothelium by expression of antithrombotic factors on its surface. Sepsis, which causes disruption and apoptosis of endothelial cells results in the endothelium switching to a procoagulant phenotype. This promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation. Moreover, only once disruption of the plaque surface has occurred are these prothrombotic effects likely to be significant in the pathogenesis of ACS. Sepsis is also largely associated with haemodynamic changes. Coronary artery perfusion pressure is reduced in peripheral vasodilation, which results in reduced blood pressure and reduced myocardial contractility. Endothelial dysfunction induces coronary vasoconstriction. This is caused by catecholamine release and by infections. Severe infections lead to increase myocardial metabolic demands and hypoxia. When neuronal tissue is deprived of adequate oxygen, the haemodynamic response has less of an effect at active neuronal tissue. All of these disturbances increase the likelihood of ACS, due to coronary plaque rupture and thrombosis. Overall, ACS results from the damage of coronaries by atherosclerosis, so primary prevention of ACS is to prevent atherosclerosis by controlling risk factors. This includes eating healthy, exercising regularly, and controlling cholesterol levels.

===Pulmonary arterial hypertension===
Pulmonary hypertension (PAH) is disease of small pulmonary arteries that is usually caused by more than one mechanism. This includes pneumonia, parasitic infections, street drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines that cause constriction of blood vessels, and many more. Vasoactive mediators, such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, along with overexpression of vasoconstrictors not only affect vascular tone but also promote vascular remodeling. PAH deals with increase blood pressure in pulmonary arteries, which leads to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, rarely hemoptysis, and many other symptoms. PAH can be a severe disease, which may lead to decreased exercise tolerance, and ultimately heart failure. It involves vasoconstrictions of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. As a result, the heart has a hard time pumping blood through the lungs, and the blood vessels eventually undergoes fibrosis. The increased workload on the heart causes hypertrophy of the right ventricle, which leads less blood being pump through the lungs and decreased blood to the left side of the heart. As a result of all of this, the left side of the heart has a hard time pumping a sufficient supply of oxygen to the rest of the body, which deteriorates the effect of the haemodynamic response. Impaired haemodynamic responses in turn diminish exercise capacity in patients with PAH. The severity of haemodynamic dysfunction during progressive exercise in PAH can be recorded using cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), and/or impedance cardiography (ICG). Furthermore, there are no current cures for pulmonary arterial hypertension, but there are treatment options for patients with the disease to help prolong their survival and quality of life. A few of these treatments include basic therapy, calcium-channel blockers, and prostacyclin therapy. Basic therapy can lead to dramatic clinical improvements in patients with right heart failure by instituting diuretic therapy. This reduces the right ventricular preload. Moreover, high-dose calcium-channel blockers among patients who have a response to this treatment can prolong survival and improve pulmonary haemodynamics. Calcium channel blocking drugs results in regression of right ventricular hypertrophy. On the other hand, prostacyclin therapy prolongs survival by inducing relaxation of vascular smooth muscles. This stimulates the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which inhibits the growth of smooth-muscle cells.

Overall, pulmonary arterial tension and acute coronary syndromes are few of the many diseases that lead to hypoxia of neuronal tissue, which in turns deteriorates the haemodynamic response and leads to neuronal death. Prolonged hypoxia induces neuronal death via apoptosis. With a dysfunctional haemodynamic response, active neuronal tissue due to membrane depolarization lacks the necessary energy to propagate signals, as a result of blood flow hindrance. This affects many functions in the body, and may lead to severe symptoms.

===Reduced haemodynamic response diseases===

==== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ====
In this disease, there is a build of the amyloid beta protein in the brain. This ultimately leads to a reduction in the haemodynamic response and less blood flow in the brain. This reduced cerebral blood flow not only kills neuronal cells because of shortages in oxygen and glucose but it also reduces the brain&#x27;s ability to remove amyloid beta. In a healthy brain, these protein fragments are broken down and eliminated. In Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the fragments accumulate to form hard, insoluble plaques which reduce blood flow. Two proteins are involved in this accumulation of amyloid beta: serum response factor or SRF and myocardin. Together, these 2 proteins determine whether smooth muscle of blood vessels contract. SRF and myocardin are more active in the brains of people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. When these proteins are active, they turn on SREBP2 which inhibits LRP-1. LRP-1 helps the brain remove amyloid beta. Therefore, when SRF and myocardin are active, there is a buildup in amyloid beta protein which ultimately leads to less blood flow in the brain because of contracted blood vessels.

====Ischemia====
A decrease in circulation in the brain vasculature due to stroke or injury can lead to a condition known as ischemia. In general, decrease in blood flow to the brain can be a result of thrombosis causing a partial or full blockage of blood vessels, hypotension in systemic circulation (and consequently the brain), or cardiac arrest. This decrease in blood flow in the cerebral vascular system can result in a buildup of metabolic wastes generated by neurons and glial cells and a decrease in oxygen and glucose delivery to them. As a result, cellular energy failure, depolarization of neuronal and glial membranes, edema, and excess neurotransmitter and calcium ion release can occur. This ultimately ends with cell death, as cells succumb to a lack of nutrients to power their metabolism and to a toxic brain environment, full of free radicals and excess ions that damage normal cell organelle function.

==Clinical use==

Changes in brain activity are closely coupled with changes in blood flow in those areas, and knowing this has proved useful in mapping brain functions in humans. The measurement of haemodynamic response, in a clinical setting, can be used to create images of the brain in which especially active and inactive regions are shown as distinct from one another. This can be a useful tool in diagnosing neural disease or in pre-surgical planning. Functional MRI and PET scan are the most common techniques that use haemodynamic response to map brain function. Physicians use these imaging techniques to examine the anatomy of the brain, to determine which specific parts of the brain are handling certain high order functions, to assess the effects of degenerative diseases, and even to plan surgical treatments of the brain.

===Functional magnetic resonance imaging===

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is the medical imaging technique used to measure the haemodynamic response of the brain in relation to the neural activities. It is one of the most commonly used devices to measure brain functions and is relatively inexpensive to perform in a clinical setting. The onset of neural activity leads to a systematic series of physiological changes in the local network of blood vessels that include changes in the cerebral blood volume per unit of brain tissue (CBV), changes in the rate of cerebral blood flow, and changes in the concentration of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. There are different fMRI techniques that can pick up a functional signal corresponding to changes in each of the previously mentioned components of the haemodynamic response. The most common functional imaging signal is the blood-oxygen-level dependent signal (BOLD), which primarily corresponds to the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin. The BOLD effect is based on the fact that when neuronal activity is increased in one part of the brain, there is also an increased amount of cerebral blood flow to that area which is the basis of haemodynamic response. This increase in blood flow produces an increase in the ratio of oxygenated hemoglobin relative to deoxygenated hemoglobin in that specific area. The difference in magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin is what allows fMRI imaging to produce an effective map of which neurons are active and which are not. In short, deoxygenated hemoglobin is paramagnetic while oxygenated hemoglobin is diamagnetic. Diamagnetic blood (oxyhemoglobin) interferes with the magnetic resonance (MR) signal less and this leads to an improved MR signal in that area of increased neuronal activity. However, Paramagnetic blood (deoxyhemoglobin) makes the local magnetic field inhomogenous. This has the effect of dephasing the signal emitted in this domain, causing destructive interference in the observed MR signal. Therefore, greater amounts of deoxyhemoglobin lead to less signal. Neuronal activity ultimately leads to an increase in local MR signaling corresponding to a decrease in the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin.

If fMRI can be used to detect the regular flow of blood in a healthy brain, it can also be used to detect the problems with a brain that has undergone degenerative diseases. Functional MRI, using haemodynamic response, can help assess the effects of stroke and other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on brain function. Another way fMRI could be used is in the planning of surgery of the brain. Surgeons can use fMRI to detect blood flow of the most active areas of the brain and the areas involved in critical functions like thought, speech, movement, etc. In this way, brain procedures are less dangerous because there is a brain mapping that shows which areas are vital to a person&#x27;s life. Haemodynamic response is vital to fMRI and clinical use because through the study of blood flow we are able to examine the anatomy of the brain and effectively plan out procedures of the brain and link together the causes of degenerative brain disease.

Resting state fMRI enables the evaluation of the interaction of brain regions, when not performing a specific task. This is also used to show the default mode network.

===PET scan===

PET scan or Positron emission tomography scan is also used alongside fMRI for brain imaging. PET scan can detect active brain areas either haemodynamically or metabolically through glucose intake. They allow one to observe blood flow or metabolism in any part of the brain. The areas that are activated by increased blood flow and/or increased glucose intake are visualized in increased signal in the PET image.

Before a PET scan begins, the patient will be injected with a small dose of a radioactive medicine tagged to a tracer such as glucose or oxygen. Therefore, if the purpose of the PET scan is to determine brain activity, FDG or fluorodeoxyglucose will be the medicine used. FDG is a complex of radioactive fluorine that is tagged with glucose. If a certain part of the brain is more active, more glucose or energy will be needed there and more FDG will be absorbed. This increase in glucose intake will be detectable with increased signal in the PET image. PET scanners provide this feature because they measure the energy that is emitted when positrons from the radiotracer collide with electrons in the brain. As a radiotracer is broken down, more positrons are made and there will be an increased signal in the PET scan.

<text>The Napanee River is a river in Lennox and Addington County and Frontenac County in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and flows from its source at Camden Lake to its mouth at the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario at Napanee. It flows through a valley of preglacial origin. The valley of the Napanee is lined with settlements such as Greater Napanee, Newburgh, Camden East, Yarker, and Petworth.

This river was originally called the Appanea. A grist mill was constructed on the river in 1785 near the current site of the town of Greater Napanee. Other mills were added at Yarker and Camden East.

<text>The University of Oviedo (, Asturian: &quot;Universidá d&#x27;Uviéu&quot;) is a public university in Asturias (Spain). It is the only university in the region. It has three campus and research centres, located in Oviedo, Gijón and Mieres.

==History==
The University of Oviedo was established under the terms and conditions of the will of Archbishop Fernando de Valdés Salas (1483–1568), who was the General Inquisitor under Philip II of Spain, and funded by his estate. In 1574 Pope Gregory XIII granted the papal bull to create the university and in 1604 Philip III issued its charter. It first opened for the teaching of classes on September 21, 1608.

The ancient university had three faculties: the Faculty of Arts, which every student had to graduate from in order to continue his training in one of the other; and the Faculties of Theology and Law, sometimes known as the higher faculties.

After the French invasion of Spain the &quot;Historical Building&quot; of the university was occupied by invading troops and lectures were suspended until the War ended in 1812.

During the 19th century, a group of liberal professors tried to bring the university closer to the working class with the (a popular education programme sponsored by the institution). However, this goal was not fully achieved, and on October 13, 1934, during the leftist miners revolt in Asturias, the university (including its Library and the Art Gallery) was set fire either by the revolutionaries or the government bomber airplanes.
It was rebuilt after the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).

The number of faculties has multiplied in the modern university, both through subdivisions of the traditional four faculties, and through the absorption of academic disciplines which have developed within originally vocational schools, in areas such as engineering or nursing.

Nowadays, the university has 31 faculties and professional schools, offering degrees and diplomas in over 150 fields of study.

<text>The is a national expressway in Japan. It is owned and operated by NEXCO Central.

==Naming==

Officially the expressway is designated as the Chūō Expressway Nishinomiya Route (from Takaido Interchange to Komaki Junction), the Chūō Expressway Nagano Route (from Takaido Interchange to Okaya Junction), and the Chūō Expressway Fujiyoshida Route (from Takaido Interchange through Ōtsuki Junction to Kawaguchiko Interchange, this section being a branch of the main route). These designations do not appear on any signage as all sections are signed simply as the Chūō Expressway.

==Overview==

The Chūō Expressway is a major roadway connecting the greater Tokyo and Nagoya urban areas, a role also shared by the Tōmei Expressway. While the Tōmei Expressway follows a coastal route, the Chūō Expressway follows an inland route through the mountainous regions of Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, and Gifu Prefectures, its highest point (1,015 meters above sea level) being at 157.3 km point sandwiched between the Yatsugatake Mountains and Southern Japanese Alps. In addition, a branch of the expressway in Yamanashi Prefecture known as the Kawaguchiko Route facilitates access to Mount Fuji and the Fuji Five Lakes area.

The expressway is 4 lanes for its entire length except for the section between Uenohara Interchange and Ōtuski Junction, which is 6 to 7 lanes. This section was originally 4 lanes as well, however increasing traffic volume led to the construction of a new parallel roadway for Uenohara-bound traffic, with the original 4 lanes of roadway being converted for the use of Ōtsuki-bound traffic only.

Tolls on the section from Takaido Interchange to Hachiōji Interchange are charged at a flat rate. As of October 2024, the toll on this section is 1000 yen for a regular passenger car. Tolls on all other sections of the expressway are assessed according to distance travelled in the same manner as most other national expressways. Also, tolls on the section from Sonohara Interchange to Nakatsugawa Interchange are assessed at 1.6 times the normal rate to account for the high cost of constructing the Enasan Tunnel. Vehicles carrying dangerous materials are forbidden from using this tunnel and must use alternate routes.

It is the largest Italian telecommunications services provider in revenues and subscribers. It was founded in 1994 by the merger of several state-owned telecommunications companies, the most prominent of which was SIP, the former state monopoly telephone operator in Italy.

The company&#x27;s stock is traded in the Borsa Italiana. The Italian State has exercised the &quot;Golden Power&quot; on TIM since 2017, which allows the government to take a number of actions when the strategic interests of the country are concerned.

It has also a subsidiary in Brazil, known as TIM Brasil, with 72.6 million customers. The brand covers over 114 million customers worldwide.

As April 2024, Net sales are distributed geographically as follows: Italy (72.9%) and Brazil (27.1%).

==History==

===Origins===
In 1925, the Italian phone network was reorganised by the Benito Mussolini cabinet and the company STIPEL was established in the same year. The original core of Telecom Italia included four companies which operated in a specific geographical area.: TIMO, TE.TI., TELVE and SET.

In 1964, Società Idroelettrica Piemontese (SIP), a former energy company founded in 1918, ceased producing energy and acquired all of the Italian telephone companies, becoming Società Italiana per l&#x27;Esercizio Telefonico. It was run by the Italian Ministry of Finance.

SIP was a state monopoly from 1964 to 1996 and Italian people had to pay the &quot;Canone Telecom&quot; (a line rental charge of about €120 per year, plus hardware rental and other minor costs) in order to have a phone at home.

===1994–2005: Telecom Italia, Telecom Italia Mobile and DSL services===

The first appearance in the Italian mobile telephony market dates back to 1990 with the launch of the TACS network by the Telecom Italia Mobile Radio Services division.

Telecom Italia was officially created on 27 July 1994 by the merge of several telecommunications companies among which SIP, IRITEL, Italcable, Telespazio and SIRM (companies owned by STET). This was due to a reorganization plan for the telecommunications sector presented by IRI to the Minister of Finance.

In 1995, the mobile telephony division was spun off as &quot;Telecom Italia Mobile&quot; (TIM), while Telecom Italia, under managing director Francesco Chirichigno, would take care of fixed and public telephony and network infrastructure. 
On 7 October, after the experimentation period at the CSELT, TIM launched the first rechargeable prepaid card for Italy, the &quot;TIM Card&quot;, becoming the first telephone company in the world to introduce this charging system. 
Towards the end of 1996 TIM was the first world operator to launch a tariff plan based on a prepaid card on the GSM network, which in a short time generated rapid growth in mobile telephony. 
Interbusiness, Italy&#x27;s largest internet network, was created and in the same period with &quot;Telecom Italia Net&quot; (Tin.it) and the first Internet Service Providers (ISPs), internet access became a reality in Italy. 
In 1996, TIM introduced a new prepaid rechargeable phone card (GSM), and one year later launched short messaging service (SMS) capability. 

In 1997, under the chairmanship of Guido Rossi, Telecom Italia was privatised and was transformed into a large multimedia group.

In February 1997, TIM received the GSM World Award for marketing in Cannes, an important acknowledgment from the association that brings together GSM network operators from all over the world, thanks to the success of the prepaid card (over 800,000 customers in less than four months since the start of marketing).

In 1999, an experimentation plan of UMTS was launched with Ericsson. This 3G mobile radio system would have made it possible to access the internet at higher speeds, transmit data and access multimedia services.

By 2001, the company was in debt and was acquired by Marco Tronchetti Provera. The following year, the group released its DSL Flat service in Italy, Alice ADSL, with a download speed of 32 kbit/s and an upload speed of 8 kbit/s for €40/month plus a monthly based tax of €14.57, the &quot;Canone Telecom&quot;, besides the mandatory monthly bills for home telephone numbers (a home telephone number was required for ADSL service). Telecom Italia Media, the group&#x27;s multimedia company, was formed in 2003 from SEAT Pagine Gialle, focussing its business on the television sector with La7 and MTV channels.

After the reorganization of editorial activities, Telecom Italia acquired Tin.it and Virgilio from Telecom Italia Media in 2005 .

The Telecom Italia Group also operates in South America; in Brazil as TIM Brasil, and in Argentina and Paraguay with Telecom Argentina. TIM Brasil has its local headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. Telecom Italia also had a 50% share in the Bolivian telecommunications company Entel until its share was nationalised by the Bolivian government in 2008.

In 2002, TIM was the first mobile telecommunications company in Europe to launch MMS services. Between 2002 and 2004, it launched some value-added services: SMS and MMS content, Internet browsing using WAP technology, games and Java applications.

In 2003, the world&#x27;s first mobile television service was launched, exploiting the video playback capabilities appearing on mobile terminals in that period and, again in 2003, it stipulated an international roaming agreement, similar to that of Vodafone, with operators world&#x27;s leading mobile (T-Mobile, Orange and TeliaSonera). This alliance will be called FreeMove.

In 2004, as part of the &quot;TIM Turbo&quot; project, the EDGE and UMTS services were created for high-speed data transmission.

===2005–2014: Telecom Italia acquired by Telefónica===
In 2005, the first Italian mobile community, &quot;TIM Tribù&quot;, was formed.

In June 2005, TIM merged into Telecom Italia, remaining active as brand for Telecom Italia&#x27;s mobile telephony offer.

Telecom Italia reported mounting debts in 2005, and, one year later, CEO Marco Tronchetti Provera resigned.

In 2007 the company was bought by Telco, a consortium of Telefónica and several Italian banks. 
Telefónica owned 46% of Telco, the holding company that controlled 22% of Telecom Italia.

In December 2011, the company developed &quot;TIM Cloud&quot;, a cloud storage service dedicated to its customers where they can save digital files.

In November 2012, TIM launched its LTE network.

The &quot;TIM Wallet&quot; service was born in February 2013, to be able to make payments via smartphone thanks to NFC technology.

In late 2013, Telefónica announced its intention to acquire the entirety of Telco by January 2014, potentially becoming Telecom Italia&#x27;s largest shareholder. The plan, however, is being challenged by the Brazilian competition authority since Telefónica and Telecom Italia, with Vivo and TIM respectively, are the two largest telephone companies competing in Brazil.

In 2014, multimedia entertainment services were launched through the TIMgames, TIMmusic, TIMreading and TIMvision applications.

===2015: Rebrand===
In 2015, the company started a rebranding process towards the unified TIM brand, which would no longer be used only to identify mobile telephony offers but also for fixed telephony ones, abandoning the Telecom Italia brand. In the same year, the board of directors approved the new company&#x27;s division, Infrastrutture Wireless Italiane (INWIT) which operates 11,500 wireless towers.

TIM was the Official Global Partner of Expo 2015. Thanks to the company&#x27;s contribution, it was possible to create the first Italian digital smart city, directly in the exhibition area. TIM has in fact equipped the entire area with technological solutions, fixed network, mobile and Internet infrastructures and coverage of the exhibition site with fixed and mobile ultra-broadband connections and Wi-Fi connections based on Cisco technology.

===2015–2018: Vivendi===
It was revealed in October 2015 that shareholders Vivendi would raise their stakes further in the company from its current level of 15.49%. As of May 2017, Vivendi owns 24.6% of the company with Vivendi&#x27;s CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine becoming executive chairman of Telecom Italia. Amos Genish is the new CEO since 28 September 2017 and he has been criticized to have fired 4500 Telecom Italia employees in June 2018. He has been substituted by Luigi Gubitosi, who became the new CEO on 18 November 2018.

In 2016, following the rebranding that led to the adoption of the single TIM brand, the parent company also decided to change its identity. The company name of Telecom Italia it was in fact changed to TIM Group, however still maintaining the previous name on some occasions.

===2023–2024: the spin-off of NetCo===

On 12 June 2024 Moody&#x27;s improves its rating on TIM, raising it to Ba3 from B1.

On 1 July 2024 the transfer of the network to KKR took place, with a debt reduction of 22 billion euros. 
The operation values the network at a total of 18.8 billion euros, expandable up to 22 billion with the earn outs also linked to the possible merger between NetCo and Open Fiber. 

On 9 July 2024, S&amp;P, after the sale of the network to the KKR, promoted the TIM Group to BB from the previous B+, with the outlook remaining stable.

On July 31, 2024, Tim presented its half-yearly results, with a debt that after the sale of the network settles at 8.1 billion euros, with a further reduction of 0.6 billion expected for the end of the year. TIM had a turnover of 7.1 billion euros (+3.5%) and an EBITDA of 2.1 (+9.4%).
Fitch, following Moody&#x27;s and S&amp;P, upgraded the rating to BB with a stable outlook.

On August 19, 2024, TIM announces a partnership with Nokia to enhance the 5G mobile network in Brazil.

On October 2, 2024, TIM examines the proposal formulated by the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance together with the Asterion fund for the purchase of the entire share of Sparkle. TIM would thus conclude the debt restructuring process by collecting an additional 700 million euros.

On 23 October 2024, corruption charges are formulated by the Guardia di Finanza and the Rome Prosecutor&#x27;s Office against the director Simone De Rose, head of the Procurement function office of TIM Group and Emilio Graziano, manager of NTT Data Italia.
TIM immediately appoints a new manager, Giampaolo Leone. TIM evaluates a request for compensation for damages to the dishonest employee and collaborates with the Guardia di Finanza inspectors in the investigation.

On November 5, 2024, the subsidiary TIM Brasil has continued to show strong growth in revenues and profits, confirming itself as a strong cash flow generator for the group.
On 13 November 2024, TIM Group published Q3/9M 2024 Financial Results. TIM Group has revenues growing to €10.7 billion with gross operating margin rising to €2.7 billion, while Tim&#x27;s adjusted net financial debt after lease is €8.0 billion.

On 17 December 2024, CVC Capital Partners is evaluating the purchase of Vivendi&#x27;s entire stake in Telecom Italia and the stock rises by 5.7%.

=== 2025–present : The sale of Sparkle ===
On 13 January 2025, the Milan court rejected the appeal presented by Vivendi against the board of directors for the sale of TIM&#x27;s network. On 15 January 2025, TIM&#x27;s board of directors discussed the offer presented by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Retelit for the sale of Sparkle. The proposed offer is approximately 700 million euros for full control of Sparkle. Furthermore, 20 January 2025 is also the deadline for TIM to negotiate with the Italian government an agreement on the refund of the 1998 license fee, an agreement worth hundreds of millions of euros. If both deals go through, there could be a further €1.8 billion cut in TIM&#x27;s already reduced debt. On 15 January 2025, the stock closed the trading day with a +0.47% at a price of €0.258, confirming a bullish trend that takes it away from the minimum values reached last year.
On February 12, 2025, Tim Group presents the 2024 financial statements with growing profits and approves the sale of Sparkle for 700 million which will be completed during the year. It also communicates the postponement of share dividends to 2026.
====Share swap between Cdp and Poste Italiane====
On February 17, 2025, there is a share exchange with Poste Italiane of the share held by Cdp, in this way Poste Italiane becomes a shareholder of Tim and Cdp exits totally from the share capital of Tim with a cash consideration and Nexi shares. Poste Italiane is not only a major shareholder, but also a strategic partner of Tim, in the Italian Government&#x27;s view of protecting and strengthening Tim as an important Italian asset.

==Controversy==
===Fraud in Brazilian prepaid mobile lines===
On 8 August 2012, TIM Brasil became involved in a massive scandal in Brazilian news after the release of report by the Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency Anatel.

The report points that on TIM&#x27;s prepaid voice plan (24.7% market share), called &quot;Infinity&quot; (in which the user pays roughly US$0.12 for each unlimited time call), the calls were intentionally dropped by the company, forcing the customers to make (and pay for) new calls to keep talking. In just one day, 8.1 million calls were dropped and the total profit was approximately $2 million. Upon release of the report, the Public Ministry of the Paraná State filed a lawsuit against TIM asking that it stop selling new mobile lines in Brasil and pay a multimillion-dollar fine for the damages against consumers.

In 2013, TIM was accused by consumers of unfair practices, such as charging 4 euros with a particular New Flat Day Free tariff.

==Operations==
The Telecom Italia Group provides phone landline services and mobile services in Italy, GSM mobile phone services in Italy and Brazil through its TIM and TIM Brasil subsidiaries, and DSL Internet and telephony services in Italy and San Marino (through Telecom Italia San Marino). It also operates in international telecommunications services for other operators and corporations, through its subsidiary Telecom Italia Sparkle. In 2013, the total amount of the company&#x27;s debt was about 26 billion €. Telecom Italia has 66,025 employees.

Telecom Italia also controls Olivetti, a manufacturer of computer peripherals and mobile phones. On March 31, 2014, Telecom Italia led both the direct fixed access lines market with a 62% share, and the mobile postpaid segment with a 45% market share. In the mobile &quot;prepaid&quot; segment Telecom Italia owned a 31.5% market share together with Vodafone.

After the merger of 3 Italy and Wind, completed on 31 December 2016 with the born of Wind Tre, Telecom Italia is now the country&#x27;s second largest carrier with 30 million customers, followed by Vodafone with 25 million customers. Telecom Italia has preserved its leadership on the direct fixed access lines market and the mobile postpaid segment.

===High debt issue===
The high accumulated debt was mainly due to the 1999 takeover bid carried out by Roberto Colaninno, who acquired the company and subsequently offloaded the purchase costs onto the company itself.

Telecom Italia S.p.A. deals with a total debt of €27 billion as of the end of 2019. Moody rated the debt with a B1 grade negative outlook in 2015. As of the end of 2023, the net financial debt after lease for the TIM Group stood at €20.3 billion. Additionally, the adjusted net financial debt was €25.7 billion.

===Removing high debt===
On 1 July 2024, with the finalization of the sale of the network to KKR, the debt was reduced by €22 billion. So TIM Group no longer has high debt. The remaining debt is in sharp reduction. Less than €7.5 billion by the end of 2024.

==Environmental practices and initiatives==
In 2002, Telecom Italia subscribed to the United Nations corporate responsibility initiative Global Compact. It is also member of a number of stock market indexes which include companies focused on corporate social responsibility, including the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes and those administered by FTSE Group&#x27;s FTSE4Good. Its part-owned Brazilian subsidiary, TIM Brasil, is listed in the Bovespa&#x27;s ISE (Índice de Sustentabilidade Empresarial) index.

Telecom Italia promotes a sustainability strategy including both environmental and social issues: in June 2014 it signed an agreement with A2A to buy energy only from renewable sources.

<doc id="971325" wikidata="Q357327" url="?curid=971325" title="Adina Howard">
<text>Adina Marie Howard (born November 14, 1973) is an American singer and songwriter. She rose to fame during the mid-1990s with her debut album, &quot;Do You Wanna Ride?&quot; and her debut single, &quot;Freak like Me&quot;. Some of her other minor hits include &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It?&quot; (with Warren G), &quot;(Freak) And U Know It&quot;, &quot;Nasty Grind&quot;, &quot;Freaks&quot; (with Play-N-Skillz and Krayzie Bone) and &quot;T-Shirt &amp; Panties&quot; (with Jamie Foxx).

==Early life==
Adina Marie Howard was born on November 14, 1973, and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by her mother with her three younger sisters. The family would later move to Phoenix, Arizona. One of her earliest role models was Madonna, another Michigan native.

In the mid-1990s, she gained the attention of manager-producer Livio Harris, who helped her record some demos and later land a deal with Max Gousse through Mecca Don/EastWest Records.

==Career==
===1993–1996: &quot;Do You Wanna Ride?&quot; and the hit success of &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;===
Her debut album &quot;Do You Wanna Ride?&quot;, featuring the Platinum-certified hit single, &quot;Freak like Me&quot;, was released in 1995 and was certified Gold by the RIAA. Her follow-up singles included &quot;My Up and Down&quot; (#32 R&amp;B, No. 68 Hot 100) and &quot;It&#x27;s All About You&quot; (#58 R&amp;B).

In 1996, she collaborated with Warren G for the &quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot; soundtrack with the single &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; which featured a sample of the Tina Turner hit. The single was another hit for the two, peaking at No. 36 on the Hot 100, No. 32 on R&amp;B, and No. 2 on the UK charts. The music video also featured Jackie Chan in a cameo. Also that year, she collaborated on a track with Somethin&#x27; for the People titled &quot;Damned If I Do&quot; which appeared on the soundtrack for &quot;A Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; as well as their self-titled debut album. She also recorded the track &quot;For the Funk&quot; for the &quot;Sunset Park&quot; soundtrack.

===1997: &quot;Welcome to Fantasy Island&quot; and acting===
In 1997, she prepared for the release of her second album, &quot;Welcome to Fantasy Island&quot; (originally titled &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;). It garnered critical raves and a moderate hit with the lead single, &quot;(Freak) And U Know It&quot;, but was shelved by Elektra Records in 1997. The album was leaked to the internet a few years later and promotional copies sell for hundreds of dollars

One of the shelved album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;T-Shirt &amp; Panties&quot; (a collaboration with Jamie Foxx) ended up on a soundtrack the following year. It was originally slated for the soundtrack to his film &quot;Booty Call&quot; but it eventually ended up on the soundtrack to the 1998 feature film &quot;Woo&quot;. It was released promotionally as a single, and the remix featured Cam&#x27;ron and Charli Baltimore.

Also this year, she collaborated with Cydal on a track titled &quot;Chocolate (Cuties &amp; Condoms)&quot; which was released as a single for the &quot;Bulletproof&quot; soundtrack. The track was also included on their debut album &quot;Cydalwayz&quot; the following year.

During this time, she made her feature film debut in the independent film &quot;High Freakquency&quot;, starring Deon Richmond and John Witherspoon.

In 2002, she filmed her second movie role, in the still-unreleased &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Demise&quot; for director Tigre Hill.

Also this year, she collaborated with the Hip-Hop group PYG&#x27;z and Yuck Mouth on the track &quot;Been Around the World&quot; for the former&#x27;s debut album.

===1998–2005: New label and &quot;The Second Coming&quot;===
By 2004, Howard released her third album &quot;The Second Coming&quot; on Rufftown Records. A video was made for the first single, &quot;Nasty Grind&quot;, Mark Rezyka Directed the video and the music video was produced by Jack Edward Sawyers. The video featured Adina topless covering herself while she sang. The video played on BET during early morning hours. The album sold poorly due to lack of promotion and only managed to gather 40,000 copies on store shelves and she was later sued by the label. A second single, &quot;(Outside) The Club&quot; was slated to be released, along with a remix album &quot;The Second Coming: Remixed &amp; UnCut&quot; but both were canceled following her departure from the label.

Later that year, she collaborated with Play-N-Skillz and Krayzie Bone for the track &quot;Freaks&quot; which sampled her hit single &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;. The single appeared on the Play-N-Skillz album &quot;The Process&quot; and became a hit, peaking at No. 52 R&amp;B and No. 69 on the Hot 100 (her first-charting single in 7 years).

She released an official mixtape album (with DJ RIP) featuring new songs, remixes, and unreleased tracks titled &quot;Let You Hit&quot; through SoundJewelz.com on August 5, 2005.

===2006–2007: &quot;Private Show&quot;===
In 2006, she announced that the single &quot;Phone Sex&quot; was going to be released, but the following year, the song &quot;L.O.V.A.&quot; was released digitally as her lead single. Additionally, a song titled &quot;Hips&quot; was announced to be her second single.

Her fourth album, &quot;Private Show&quot; was delayed many times by Arsenal Records, almost to the point of being shelved. However, it was released on June 26, 2007, along with a promotional single, &quot;Picture This&quot;. As of 2008, the album has sold 4,000+ copies. Following the album&#x27;s release, a remixes EP for &quot;My Hips&quot; (appears as &quot;Hips&quot; on her album) was released on iTunes &amp; other digital services in December. A third official single, &quot;Tease&quot; was slated to be released, but as Howard parted ways with the label shortly after the album&#x27;s release, it was cancelled.

In 2008, she appeared in the short film &quot;Poke the Sleeping Bear&quot; which won the Grand Jury Award at the 2008 Solstice Film Festival.

On September 25, 2009, a UK compilation &quot;Independent Soul Divas 2&quot; was released on Lola Waxx Records. This compilation album featured &quot;What Do I Do&quot;, a song recorded by Howard in 2008. The album version is different than the version that was originally included on Howard&#x27;s MySpace page.

She premiered a snippet of the single on January 28 on her official YouTube page. A longer version premiered on March 6 on the mixtape &quot;DJ Jump Off&#x27;s R&amp;B Madness Volume 4&quot;.

She also filmed an episode of TV One&#x27;s &quot;Life After&quot; in April, and it is set to premiere during the Fall 2013 season on October 2. In July, she announced that she will be releasing an EP next, ahead of her forthcoming fifth studio album.

On September 10, 2013, she released her new single &quot;Switch&quot; which is the lead single off her fifth studio album &quot;The Switch Up&quot;. It received positive reviews, and won &quot;Best Dance/Club Single of the Year&quot; at the 2013 UB Honors, which was voted by the public.

On December 3, 2013, it was announced that Howard would be the resident chef on Wednesday nights at Michael&#x27;s Cafe and Supper Club in Phoenix, Arizona. She completed her run at the end of December.

In June 2014, it was announced that Howard had landed the lead role of April in Derrell Lawrence&#x27;s touring stage play &quot;Do You Trust Your Best Friend?&quot; and is set to make her stage debut in October in Washington, DC. She later confirmed that her role had been changed to Olivia in the play.

In June, she announced that her single &quot;Bad 4 Me&quot; will make its premiere on a San Diego, CA radio station on June 5, ahead of her appearance at the Urban Network Digital &quot;Back To Basics 2&quot; Music Summit that weekend. It was released to digital outlets on August 14, 2015. She was also working on her next album now titled &quot;#IHeartAdinaHoward&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Switch Up&quot;). She was featured on Pitbull&#x27;s single &quot;FREE.K&quot;, which sampled her hit single &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;.

Her &quot;Being&quot; interview originally filmed back in 2014, premiered on December 9, 2015, under their new series &quot;Designed For&quot;.

In March 2016, she was featured on the new single &quot;Freak&quot; by R3hab and Quintino, who sampled her single &quot;Freak Like Me&quot;.

In May 2016, she previewed four new songs (&quot;Love Jones&quot;, &quot;Come Over&quot;, &quot;Nasty&quot; and &quot;Run It&quot;) from &quot;Resurrection&quot; on her Periscope account, in addition to doing a mini-concert for her fans.

In June 2016, she announced she&#x27;ll be playing the role of Candice in the new stage musical &quot;For All My Girls&quot; alongside April Nixon, Monifah and Marlain Angelides premiering in New York on June 27.

In July, one of her new promotional photos went viral, in which she released a sneak peek into her album for her fans the following weekend. A year after its release, the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Bad 4 Me&quot; was featured on MTV and garnered renewed interest and radio airplay. In November, she announced the &quot;Resurrection&quot; album will be released on March 17, 2017.

On December 6, 2016, she released a &quot;Resurrection&quot; mixtape with DJ Daz-One on AudioMack. A few days earlier, her vocals were sampled once again on the DJ Luke Nasty track &quot;Adina (Freaks)&quot; produced by Djay Cas.

On January 25, 2017, she shot a music video for the track &quot;Blasphemy&quot; in California. It premiered on March 20, 2017.

On March 17, 2017, an EP containing previously unreleased/released material was released through Famous Records Corp / Echo International called &quot;Freaky&quot;. While many of the song titles were variations on the word &quot;freak&quot; they were actually renamed tracks from previous releases. &quot;(Gonna Make You) Freaky&quot; was previously released as &quot;It&#x27;s On Tonight&quot; from her &quot;Let You Hit&quot; mixtape, &quot;Time to Freak&quot; is rumored to actually be called &quot;Too Sexy&quot; or &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, &quot;Freak Like Me (Remix) (Re-Recorded Version)&quot; was an actual previously released remix on her 1995 hit single, and &quot;Stay Freaky&quot; was a previously leaked duet with Estevan called &quot;Rough Ridin″&quot;.

Her fourth studio album &quot;Resurrection&quot; was released on April 14, 2017. Due to some issues with iTunes and other digital services, Howard decided to release the album for free (on her SoundCloud) for 24 hours beginning at 12 pm PST. A week later, the album was finally released on all digital services.

In November, she released a short tour film titled &quot;Adina Howard: Resurrection Tour Atlanta&quot; which premiered on digital services.

Later that month, she received two UB Honors nominations in the Best Artist Return Single (for &quot;Blasphemy&quot; with King Gas) and Best Independent R&amp;B Album Release (for &quot;Resurrection&quot;). In December, she further received two more award nominations, at the MCP Music Awards for Best Deep Cut of the Year (&quot;Radiation&quot; (with Tech N9ne)) and Best Comeback of the Year (for &quot;Blasphemy&quot; with King Gas).

In January 2018, she did an interview with the online radio show &quot;Tha Council Radio&quot; and announced she was in the works of co-writing a self-help book tentatively called &quot;Adina Howard: Real Raw&quot; with a therapist. She also announced a new film role in the independent film &quot;The Relaxer&quot;, which was to premiere at the 2018 SXSW Festival in March. Additionally, she confirmed she was working with producer-rapper King Gas again on a new album tentatively titled &quot;Diary of a Desperate Housewife&quot;.

===2019–present: &quot;Mind Reader&quot; and more ventures===
The new year brought her some high-profile releases. Her profile on TV One&#x27;s hit &quot;Unsung&quot; series premiered on March 10, 2019. Later that month, her film &quot;Relaxer&quot; (directed by Joel Potrykus) was released to theaters on March 22, 2019, through Oscilloscope Labs. It garnered critical praise, receiving a 72% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes.

In May, she announced a new single with Mothers Favorite Child called &quot;Freak&quot; after collaborating with them for her acoustic performances for her TV One episode.

She appeared in the documentary &quot;A Fatherless America&quot; from media personality and filmmaker Tommy Sotomayor which was released in June 2019.

With her promotion for a Detroit performance with Montell Jordan in July, she discussed a new single in the works called &quot;Lifeline&quot; in addition to a book and a motivational speaking career. In a cover story interview with Consciousness Magazine, she announced hopes for a second quarter release for the single.

At the beginning of 2020, her new dance single &quot;Mind Reader&quot; with Opolopo was announced, and released on January 17. After a few weeks, the song ended up hitting #1 on the TraxSource charts as well as #2 on the Dutch FREAK31 music chart.

In an interview with R&amp;B Junkie celebrating the 25th anniversary of her debut album, she discussed starting a Houston, TX residency set to begin in May.

She also joined Katrina Walker&#x27;s new theatrical stage play &quot;Miss Dee&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; which was set to premiere April 3 but was postponed until further notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In December, she received another nomination at the UB Honors in the Best Dance/Club Single of the Year category for her single &quot;Mind Reader.&quot;

In January 2021, it was announced that her previously shelved album &quot;Welcome to Fantasy Island&quot; will be finally released in the United States on February 19 thru Rhino Records.

She released a new single titled &quot;Keep Lookin&quot; on April 23, 2022 to streaming and digital services. A remix featuring Trina was released in July.

Howard began filming a new film, the drama “False Profits” with director Jamezz Hampton in November.

In July 2023, Howard released her first wine “Indelible” in a collaboration with Ramona Ranch Winery along with the announcement of her new upcoming single “Liquor.”

==Personal life==
She divorced Sherman Jordan in 2017.

On the March 10, 2019 episode of TV One&#x27;s &quot;Unsung,&quot; Howard revealed to having an affair with Boyz II Men&#x27;s Wanya Morris, who was dating singer Brandy, at the time. Despite the advice of Atlantic Records Label Executive (and Howard&#x27;s boss) Sylvia Rhone to focus on her career, Howard conducted an interview with then-DJ Wendy Williams, in which she insulted both Rhone and Brandy. Rhone eventually stalled Howard&#x27;s release of her second album indefinitely.

<doc id="971327" wikidata="Q5477008" url="?curid=971327" title="Fox Tor">
<text>Fox Tor is a relatively minor tor on Dartmoor in the county of Devon, England.

On the flank of the tor, about 500 m to the north stands Childe&#x27;s Tomb - according to local legend, the last resting place of Childe the Hunter, an unfortunate traveller who died there during a blizzard.

About 800 m. NNE of the tor lie the remains of Foxtor Farm, which was used by Eden Phillpotts as one of the main settings of his 1904 novel &quot;The American Prisoner&quot;, and in a subsequent early &quot;talkie&quot; film, made in 1929.

Occupancy of Fox Tor farm lasted for fifty years, and various people tried grazing sheep on the land in short stays from 1807 to the 1880s.

Little Fox Tor, also known as Yonder Tor lies about 500 m. to the east.

About a kilometre north-east of the tor lies the swampy land or mire known as Fox Tor Mires. This is said to have been the inspiration for the fictional Grimpen Mire in the novel &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This wide expanse of peat bog continues to be dangerous to walkers, especially after heavy rain.

There is another Fox Tor on Dartmoor, one of five outcrops on the western bank of the River Tavy in woodland north of Peter Tavy, at grid reference SX514788. There is another on Bodmin Moor near Lewannick.

<doc id="971343" wikidata="Q59990" url="?curid=971343" title="Blake and Mortimer">
<text>The Adventures of Blake &amp; Mortimer is a Belgian comics series created by writer and comics artist Edgar P. Jacobs. It was one of the first book series to appear in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot; in 1946, and was subsequently published in book form by Belgian comic book publisher Le Lombard.

The main protagonists of the adventures are Philip Mortimer, a leading British scientist, and his friend Captain Francis Blake, of MI5. The books&#x27; recurring antagonist is the sworn enemy of the heroes, Colonel Olrik, who appears very frequently throughout the series, in almost every book. Their confrontations take them into the realms of detective investigation and science fiction, dealing with themes of time travel, historical events, and espionage.

Since Jacobs&#x27; death, many new titles of the series have been published by other authors, mainly two separate teams of artists and writers, with the amount of these new editions significantly dwarfing Jacobs&#x27; contributions. A television series based upon the series was produced in 1997, entitled &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot;.

The books by Jacobs himself are generally set in the period of their writing, but those authored by others after his death are set mostly in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Main characters==
The presence of the basis of the series&#x27; three main characters (looks, personality, attitudes) is apparent in Jacobs&#x27; unrelated, first full-length graphic novel, &quot;The U-Ray&quot; (1943), which predates the inception of this series. Here, their origins are left unspecified, and they are portrayed only as two proud Britons serving HM&#x27;s Government.

They debut in the first books of the series&#x27; Francophone releases, the three-part story &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, although the English language version of the series lists these titles as being books 15 to 17. They instead suggest, by designating this book as the first in the series, that they first appear in &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;, although captions within the book contradict this.

The later, post-Jacobs title &quot;The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent&quot; provides insight into their early lives, and shows them making acquaintance – then beginning their friendship – during the time of the British Raj.
Overviews of the main characters are as follows:
*Professor Philip Angus Mortimer – a seemingly archetypical British gentlemanly scholar, he is a leading physicist of Scottish descent, having grown up in colonial India and moved England to attend university. His character is based upon a friend and occasional collaborator of Jacobs, Jacques Van Melkebeke, with the addition of a beard.
*Captain Francis Percy Blake – a Welsh-born officer in His Majesty&#x27;s armed forces, he studied at Oxford University and later became head of the British Security Service MI5, and is currently still very active in the field. He is a master of disguise, even managing to fool Mortimer on occasion. Blake is modelled on another friend and occasional collaborator of Jacobs, Jacques Laudy, with the addition of a mustache.
*Colonel Olrik – the long-time, recurring villain from the first instalment onwards. Of the original series, only &quot;The Time Trap&quot; (&quot;Le Piège Diabolique&quot;) did not feature him in any capacity, and among the successive series, he has appeared in some capacity in every volume except &quot;The Oath of the Five Lords&quot;. Olrik&#x27;s first appearance is in &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, as the head of intelligence for Oriental dictator Basam Damdu. His roles have since ranged from mercenary, spy, smuggler and general criminal adventurer. He is characterised as a Westerner, but details such as his real name, birthplace and exact nationality are left unknown. In a recent book of the series (not penned by Jacobs), Olrik is portrayed as a specialist in Slavic languages, and it is explained that he once fled Hungary, suggesting this as his country of origin. Olrik&#x27;s appearance resembles that of Jacobs.
*Lieutenant Ahmed Nasir – the faithful friend and ally of the two heroes, and has Indian ancestry. His first appearance is in part one of &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, where he prevents the two heroes from being captured by Olrik in Iran. He is a sergeant of the 5th Battalion of the &quot;Makran Levy Corps&quot;, who previously served under Blake. Following his intervention, Nasir subsequently helps the two heroes in Egypt, then in London, ultimately becoming the butler of Professor Philip Mortimer. Nasir only appears in Jacobs&#x27; first books: &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot;, and &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;. His disappearance (corresponding to that of the British Empire&#x27;s end) remains unexplained in later publications, however he eventually reappears many years later in &quot;The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent&quot;, created by Yves Sente and André Juillard. It is explained that following his resignation from the military, and his retirement from butler duties, he returned to India, where he joined their intelligence service.
*Jack – one of Olrik&#x27;s most faithful henchmen, he wears thick, round glasses. He invariably takes the role of servant or housekeeper; however, he has partaken in numerous criminal acts under Olrik&#x27;s orders, and attempted to assassinate Captain Blake at Athens airport in &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot;.
*Sharkey – a strong, albeit foolish, American henchman, another of Olrik&#x27;s closest. He worked for Dr Grossgrabenstein as the above-ground regulator of his excavation site, but was simultaneously working with Olrik to eliminate Mortimer and prevent Blake from reaching Egypt in &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot;.
*Professor Jonathan Septimus – An eccentric physician and parapsychologist, he used to live in British-occupied Sudan where he discovered Olrik in a trance after the events of &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot;, proceeding to use him as a test subject for experiments into telepathy and telekinesis. His actions ultimately turned Olrik into the &#x27;Yellow M&#x27;.
*Basam Damdu – Olrik&#x27;s commander-in-chief and the absolute dictator of the Yellow Empire. A megalomaniac based on Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, he is obsessed with ruling the world and is willing to destroy it rather than lose control of it.

Descriptions of more minor characters from the series are below:
*Glenn Kendall – the Chief Inspector of Scotland Yard. He assisted Blake and Mortimer in capturing the Yellow &#x27;M&#x27; during &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M″&quot;, however was one of the most prominent antagonists in &quot;The Francis Blake Affair&quot;, where he endeavoured to arrest Blake on the grounds of high treason.
*Ahmed Rassim Bey – a prominent historian, curator of the Egyptian Museum. He invited Mortimer to Cairo to assist him in deciphering his mysterious discoveries concerning the Great Pyramid, however was betrayed by his assistant, Abdul, who informed Olrik of his discoveries. When Abdul&#x27;s treachery was discovered, however, he assisted Mortimer in arresting the guilty parties. He is also friends with Doctor Grossgrabenstein.
*Abdul Ben Zaim – assistant to Ahmed Rassim Bey, he also worked at the Egyptian Museum, however was secretly Olrik&#x27;s accomplice, stealing secret documents and copying Ahmed&#x27;s finds on his orders. He was killed in a motor accident arranged by Olrik when he began to carelessly blunder their plot away in fear of retribution.
*Dr Grossgrabenstein – an eccentric Egyptologist, he invited Mortimer to accompany him to his excavation site on the Great Pyramid, where his presented his discoveries to him and showed him his collection. He was ambushed and imprisoned by Olrik, who wore a disguise impersonating the professor in an attempt to subjugate Mortimer, but was later freed in a battle to recapture his property.
*Superintendent Kamal – head of the Egyptian police force. A steadfast man with a serious, military, no-nonsense manner, he investigated Olrik&#x27;s break-in of the Egyptian Museum, then worked with Mortimer to arrest the treacherous Abdul. On receiving a late-night telephone call from Mortimer, he and his officers invaded Youssef&#x27;s antiques shop, then laid siege to the hotel hosting Olrik. He was the news-bearer of Abdul&#x27;s death, and later launched an attack on Grossgrabenstein&#x27;s property – at the time occupied by Olrik&#x27;s gang – ultimately recapturing it and freeing Blake, Mortimer, and Nasir.
*Youssef Khadem – one of Olrik&#x27;s henchmen, he owned an antiques shop, a rendezvous point for their gang. He fought against Mortimer when he came to his store, collaborating with the Bezendjas and Olrik to capture him. He possessed considerable knife-throwing skill, but was fatally wounded by police fire while attempting to flee from the scene.
*David Honeychurch – the deputy chief of MI5, he works for Blake. When Blake pretended to have become a traitor to England, Honeychurch was secretly on his side the entire time, deceiving his colleagues into believing the opposite. This was eventually discovered by Doyle-Smith and his minions, and he was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle&#x27;s dungeons, afterwards escaping and helping Blake and Mortimer to reclaim the property.
*Harold Doyle-Smith – under-secretary of state of the Home Office, he was in charge of coordinating various police forces. He was Blake&#x27;s commanding minister, and after Blake&#x27;s supposed treachery in &quot;The Francis Blake Affair&quot;, he became the Intelligence Service&#x27;s acting minister. He inherited Ardmuir Castle following his uncle&#x27;s death, lending it to Deloraine for a seminar, however betrayed its members by drugging them and attempting their kidnap. He was eventually discovered to have been working with Olrik&#x27;s gang all along, informing Deloraine of results of discussions he attended within the Intelligence Service, and was arrested by SAS agents following their takeover of his property.
*Major Lachlan MacQuarrie – a 34-year-old penniless Scotsman of the 18th century and a maternal ancestor of Mortimer&#x27;s, he was previously the career officer of the British Army, having served mostly overseas. Following his regiment&#x27;s defeat by the Continental Army during the American War of Independence, he was abducted by 81st century humans, resulting in his declaration as a deserter and the loss of his military status. Remaining with them for several years, he studied their time travel principles, ultimately perishing in an attempt to return to his own time.
*Jimmy Tcheng – supposedly the Chinese-American assistant to Doctor Kaufman, he was really a disfigured future human in disguise. He cooperated with Mortimer and Kaufman to analyse the finds on MacQuarrie&#x27;s body; however, after attempting to withhold a laser device discovered as part of the investigation, his betrayal was discovered by Mortimer, and following a car chase, he was killed in a tornado&#x27;s onslaught.
*Dr Jeronimo Ramirez – a lively, bustling, eccentric Mexican–American physicist of the Los Alamos Nuclear Centre, he helped Mortimer discover and prevent Operation Poplar Trees, an attempt by Olrik and 81st century humans to start a nuclear holocaust and subjugate the Earth using Hydrogen bombs.
*Dr Walter Kaufman – director of the Unidentified Flying Object Studies section of the Centre for Spatial Studies in Topeka, Kansas. An eminent American scientist, he invited Mortimer over to investigate the discovery of Major MacQuarrie&#x27;s body, and later helped him to prevent Operation Poplar Trees.

*Jessie Wingo – a half-Cheyenne FBI agent, she is Calloway&#x27;s deputy. She rescued a drowning Mortimer from Olrik&#x27;s clutches, and was subsequently part of an attack on him and Basam Damdu&#x27;s military base. Shortly afterwards, she helped to prevent Operation Poplar Trees.
*Dimitri Voronov – a Soviet scientist and biologist during the Cold War&#x27;s height, he conducted virology research and dabbled in biological warfare. A cold, calculating, ambitious figure, he opposed the current governing system of the Soviet Union, and hoped to seize control of Russia and reimplement Stalinist rule using Bacteria Z, a deadly virus he succeeded in extracting from a failed Soviet space mission. He went into hiding following his plan&#x27;s failure and the arrest of Olrik, a key collaborator in his mission.
*Nastasia Wardynska – a female friend and ally of Blake and Mortimer with Russian heritage. Formerly a MI6 double agent planted in the USSR, she was imprisoned after her betrayal was discovered by Voronov, and then subsequently freed in exchange for Olrik during a prisoner swap. She is now a CSIR researcher, having been offered the role by Mortimer, and later journeyed with him to Africa.
*Professor Akira Satō – a Japanese cybernetician, he works for the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. He has made numerous technological breakthroughs, succeeding in creating indistinguishably realistic androids and a flying machine in the image of a Japanese dragon – and, following the latter, he was betrayed by his assistant, Kim, in collaboration with Olrik&#x27;s gang, who aimed to steal the findings of his research by obtaining three formulae held at banks across Tokyo.

==Story characteristics==
Although the series&#x27; title suggests a balance in appearance of the two characters, Mortimer is often the main protagonist, seen more frequently than Blake. In the original series, it is mainly he who, through his impulsive character, gets entangled in their adventures. In comparison, Blake is depicted as a serious, formal army officer who comes Mortimer&#x27;s aid when necessary. Colonel Olrik, the main antagonist, displays a combination of the characteristics and personalities of both heroes, but his exploits are typically negative, ending with disastrous consequences.

Blake and Mortimer adventures are characterised by a quest, often involving undercover, secretive operations, ending with a heroic, liberated, or publicised ending. Furthermore, the structure of the books&#x27; storylines are often similar: in the beginning, certain unseen and significant events have already taken place – in &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;&#x27;, for instance, the antagonist of the story, &#x27;Guinea Pig&#x27;, has already committed various daring acts of theft on a grand scale, and readers only learn about this upon seeing Mortimer reading a newspaper. Also, the books often share comparable endings, with the protagonists reflecting on the wisdom they have acquired from their experiences: after returning from his time travel in &quot;The Time Trap&quot;, Mortimer concludes that rather than dwell on the &#x27;good old days&#x27; or look forward to a &#x27;brighter future&#x27;, one should be content with the present.

Blake and Mortimer are frequently shown to be residing in a shared home, in adjacent apartments, the same manner as Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. Many francophone comics share this basis of confirmed bachelors who live together, including Tintin and Captain Haddock, Asterix &amp; Obelix, Spirou &amp; Fantasio, and Tif &amp; Tondu. These series were all first published during a time when the censorship of youth publications was very heavily enforced and stringent, and male/female segregation was rigorously policed.

The settings of many of Jacobs&#x27; stories are contemporary, based on real-world events and environments, and as such the first few titles of the series present a look and feel reminiscent of the 1950s, while later instalments showcase a political climate comparable to the 1970s. One exception to this rule is, once again, &quot;The Time Trap&quot;, starring in the present (i.e. early 1960s) but with its action, caused by a sabotaged time machine, largely takes place in the 51st century – a brief venture in medieval times and a stopover in the Jurassic period also take place. Post-Jacobs stories are, so far, integrated into the chronology of the earlier books, or precede it, taking place in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

Jacobs&#x27; art style, although typical of the Belgian comics drawings (known as &#x27;clear line&#x27; or &#x27;ligne claire&#x27;), is notable for its extensive use of light colours and its containment of scenes similar to those found in film production (the panoramic view over night-time London featured as the opening scene in &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;&#x27; being a good example of this).

Conversely, the series&#x27; writing is noted for its high verbosity, such as in &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;&#x27;, which contains a page sporting over 900 words. Captions and word balloons also appear frequently, describing action being depicted visually.

==Publication history==
===Under Edgar P. Jacobs===
With the launch of the Tintin magazine, which showcased books from The Adventures of Tintin series, it included the story &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot;, introducing the characters of Blake, Mortimer, and Olrik to wider audiences.

The production of these instalments of the series ended in 1949, but the publication of further stories concerning the characters&#x27; exploits continued for many years, only ending with the death of the series&#x27; creator. Books penned and illustrated by him saw the two heroes go on adventures ranging from the lost city of Atlantis to the catacombs of Paris.

After Jacobs&#x27; death in 1987, Bob de Moor completed his last story, left unfinished following the incident.

===Following Jacobs&#x27; death===
From 1987, the Jacobs estate, centred on the still operational Jacobs Studios, republished all of Jacobs&#x27; works.

In the 1990s, after much debate about stories&#x27; authenticity, Dargaud got permission to revive the series, including the creation and publication of new stories by a newly recruited team of writers and illustrators, published as further instalments in the series. These books are still firmly set in the middle-to-late 20th century, and include many new regular supporting characters, most notably Blake&#x27;s colleagues in the security services. Much of the new additions are of the creation of two separate teams of authors, Van Hamme/Benoit and Sente/Juillard.

The first of these, The Francis Blake Affair, was published in 1996. Its storyline was provided by famous scenarist Jean Van Hamme, and specialist draughtsman Ted Benoit (whose Ligne claire drawing style resembles that of the late Jacobs&#x27;) was contracted for the artwork. Purists, partial to the original plotlines of those penned by Jacobs, immediately objected to the choice of Van Hamme and, upon publication, went on to discover the feature of some of his typically trademark plot twists, taking an instant dislike to his contribution. The elements of science fiction, prominent in earlier books by Jacobs&#x27;, were noticeably absent from this new addition, which contained a strong focus on espionage. Despite the negative reception and criticism it faced, the book was a relative success, and the publisher decided to continue the line. During this time, both Benoit and Van Hamme became engaged on other projects, and their commitments caused a delay in the production of the series&#x27; next instalment.

As an interim solution, writer Yves Sente and artist André Juillard were contracted to publish another adventure, &quot;The Voronov Plot&quot; (1998) containing prevalent themes of the Cold War.

Later on, Van Hamme and Benoit completed work on their book, The Strange Encounter, which appeared in 2001, and concerns the heroes&#x27; confrontation of mysterious alien creatures.

This was followed by the publication of Sente and Juillard&#x27;s two-part adventure &quot;The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent&quot; (&quot;Part 1: The Global Threat&quot;, in 2003; &quot;Part 2: Battle of the Spirits&quot;, in 2004) which deals with Blake and Mortimer&#x27;s youth, and the beginning of their friendship upon their first meeting in pre-independence India.

In 2008, Sente and Juillard also released another book in the series, &quot;The Gondwana Shrine&quot;, chronologically following the events of the previous two volumes, &quot;The Sarcophagi of the Sixth Continent&quot; parts 1 and 2.

The series&#x27; next adventure, a two-parter titled &quot;The Curse of the 30 Pieces of Silver&quot;, was written by Jean Van Hamme. The first book, &quot;The Manuscript of Nicodemus&quot;, was illustrated by René Sterne, whose sudden death occurred on the 15th of November 2006, and which delayed the instalments&#x27; publication. Sterne&#x27;s girlfriend, Chantal De Spiegeleer, eventually completed his work, which was published on the 20th of November 2009. Aubin Frechon illustrated the adventure&#x27;s second volume, published on the 26th of November 2010.

==List of titles==
Additionally, the Jacobs&#x27; storyboard sketches of Book 12 (Part 2 of &quot;Professor Satō&#x27;s Three Formulae&quot;), left incomplete following his death, have been re-issued in 1996 outside of the series as &quot;Dossier Mortimer contre Mortimer&quot; ().

 The Secret of the Swordfish originally consisted of two parts. In 1984, it was republished in three.

==Translations==
===English===
Like many Franco-Belgian comics, English translation publications of &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; were initially limited.

====Blake and Mortimer Editions====

Les Editions Blake and Mortimer, aka The Blake and Mortimer Editions, published English translations of the three parts of &quot;The Secret of the Swordfish&quot; in 1986, both parts of &quot;The Mystery of the Great Pyramid&quot; in 1987, and &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;&#x27; in 1988.

====Comcat====
Catalan Communications, under its &#x27;Comcat&#x27; line of books, published two books in inexpensive trade paperback copies in the US. They released:
#&quot;The Time Trap&quot; (&quot;Le Piège diabolique&quot;) (1989) 
#&quot;Atlantis Mystery&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Énigme de l&#x27;Atlantide&quot;) (1990)

==Adaptations==

===Radio series===
The Time Trap was adapted into a radio play in 1962.

===Television series===
In 1997, Ellipse animation studios made an animated series containing 26 episodes, making up 13 stories, four of which were entirely new and not based on existing books.

===Film adaptations===
Several attempts have been made to adapt &quot;The Yellow M&quot; to film, although none have been successful. Spanish director Álex de la Iglesia stated that he was working on an adaptation of the comic to be released around 2010, however this never came into fruition. At one point, surrounding rumours claimed that Hugh Laurie and Kiefer Sutherland were to play Blake and Mortimer respectively; Since then, however, nothing has come of this project.

===Games===
In 2014, French publisher Ystari Games released the deduction and social table top board game &quot;Blake &amp; Mortimer: Witness&quot;.

In 2011, French publishers Dargaud and Anuman Interactive launched the first video game adaptation of the &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; series, titled &quot;Blake and Mortimer: The Curse of the Thirty Denarii, a&quot; hidden objects game featuring both 3D and comic-strip environments.

===Popular culture===

In 2005, as part of the Brussels&#x27; Comic Book Route, a wall was designed in the Rue du Houblon/Hopstraat in Brussels, a reproduction of the one featured on the cover of &quot;The Yellow &#x27;M&quot;&#x27;. It was designed by G. Oreopoulos and D. Vandegeerde.

===Parodies===
The main characters of &quot;Blake and Mortimer&quot; have made cameo appearances in various comic series, particularly those series that are set in the same period of history, the twilight of the British Empire. They are often a tribute to their creator, Edgar P. Jacobs.

For example, they make a one-off appearance in the Valérian adventure &quot;On the False Earths&quot; when the hero visits a Victorian London club.

Another example is the popular Belgian comic series concerning the adventures of MI5 agent Colonel Clifton. Clifton once featured in a story entitled &quot;Jade&quot;, published in 2003. In it he meets two characters called Blake and Mortimer, though even as caricatures they bear little resemblance (perhaps deliberately) to Jacob&#x27;s originals. The story includes elements from the original books, such as the entrance to the secret passage from &quot;S.O.S. Météores&quot; and the cave that doubles as a submarine base in &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Francis Blake&quot;.

In 2005, Dargaud published a parody entitled &quot;Menaces sur l&#x27;Empire&quot; (&quot;The Empire Under Threat&quot;). This was a humorous presentation of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and was not part of the canon (in fact, the space reserved for the series&#x27; title reads &quot;Les Aventures de Philip et Francis&quot; as opposed to &quot;Les Aventures de Blake et Mortimer&quot;). The jokes contained include:
*Mortimer&#x27;s attempts to break his diet, which his Indian manservant always thwarts, even from a long distance
*Confusion over whether they are working for MI5 or MI6
*The heroes catching Prime Minister Winston Churchill in bed, engaged in an affair with a young woman
*A send-up of Bruce Lee&#x27;s &quot;Game of Death&quot;
Two additional volumes of &quot;Les Aventures de Philip et Francis&quot; have followed, &quot;Le Piège machiavélique&quot; (2011) and &quot;S.O.S. Météo&quot; (2014).

&quot;Tigresse Blanche&quot; (&quot;White Tigress&quot;) by Yann and Conrad is another Belgian comic series featuring the adventures of a Chinese Communist woman spy in post-World War II China. It features a British agent, Sir Francis Flake, whose friend (based on Mortimer) gets drunk on the announcement of Indian independence.

<doc id="971364" wikidata="Q425752" url="?curid=971364" title="Charles Moore (hurdler)">
<text>Charles Hewes Moore Jr. (August 12, 1929 – October 8, 2020) was an American track and field athlete, as well as a philanthropist, businessman, and champion of societal reform. Moore won a gold medal in the 400 metre hurdles in the 1952 Summer Olympics with a time of 50.8 seconds, narrowly missing the world record of 50.6 seconds. He had set the American record (50.7 seconds) during Olympic qualifying. He also ran the third leg of the second-place 4×400 metres relay at the Olympics. Moore finished second for the James E. Sullivan Award for top U.S. athlete in 1952, and was selected as one of &quot;100 Golden Olympians&quot; in 1996. In 1999, he was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame. Charles Moore, an Olympics athlete of track and field died on October 8, 2020, in Laporte, Pennsylvania. He was 91 years old.

==Athletic achievements==
Moore did not start his track and field career until attending Mercersburg Academy as a junior, where he was coached by Jimmy Curran, who recommended he try hurdling based on his father&#x27;s success with the event. His father, Charles &quot;Crip&quot; Moore, Sr. was a hurdler who made the U.S. team as an alternate in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. Charles Jr. continued with track and field as a student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he enrolled in 1947, but was limited to four years eligibility. In his fifth and final year, preceding his performance at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, he continued to compete through the New York Athletic Club.

As a student at Cornell University, Moore won NCAA titles in the 440-yard race in 1949 and the 220-yard hurdles in 1951. He won the indoor IC4A 600-yard run in 1950 and the indoor Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) 600-yard run in 1952, setting meet records in both races. He also won four straight AAU titles in the 400 metre hurdles from 1949 to 1952. At Cornell, Moore pioneered taking 13 steps between hurdles in the grueling 400-metre hurdle event, where 15 steps had been the practice prior to the 1950s. While its official use in a race is also attributed to Russian Yuriy Lituyev, many were experimenting with this as part of training.

On July 21, 1952, at the XV Olympiad in Helsinki, Finland, Moore won a gold medal and set the Olympic record in the 400 metre hurdles. He also ran the third leg for the American team&#x27;s 4x400 metre relay, which earned him a silver medal. The team&#x27;s performance broke the standing world record by 4 seconds (3:04.0), but was not sufficient to secure the gold against Jamaica, who ran the race in 3:03.9.

Moore was inducted into Cornell University&#x27;s inaugural Athletics Hall of Fame in 1978. The Charles H. Moore Outstanding Senior Varsity Athlete Award at Cornell is named for him. In March 2015, &quot;Cornell Magazine&quot; ranked him as the third greatest athlete in the university&#x27;s history. From 1994 to 1999, he was director of athletics at Cornell University.

==Corporate career==
After the Olympics in 1952 Moore fully retired from athletics to pursue a career in business that would last 42 years. This started with his family&#x27;s business Lenape Forge in 1952, which he would eventually broker the sale of to Gulf+Western in 1965. He was president and CEO of several multinational manufacturing companies, including Ransburg Corporation, Clevepak Corporation, Allied Thermal (a subsidiary of Interpace Corporation), Lapp Insulator (a division of Interpace Corporation), and Lenape Forge (a division of Gulf+Western). He also served as managing director of Peers &amp; Co. (investment banking), CEO of Peers Management Resources, Inc. (management consulting), and vice chairman of Advisory Capital Partners, Inc. (investment advising).

==Corporate social impact==
From 1992 to 2000, Moore was Public Sector Director of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and chairman of that organization&#x27;s audit committee. He has also served as chairman of the USOC&#x27;s 2012 Bid City Evaluation Task Force. Moore served as executive director of the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy (CECP) since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1999 by John C. Whitehead, Paul Newman and Peter L. Malkin until February 2013.

Moore was the former Governor of the National Art Museum of Sport, a former member of the President&#x27;s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition (PCFSN), and a National Board alumni member of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1984, while CEO of Clevepak Corporation, he received the Herbert Adams Memorial Award for Advancement of American Sculpture. &quot;CR Magazine&quot; recognized him as the NonProfit &amp; NGO CEO of the Year in 2008 and gave him its Lifetime Achievement in Philanthropy award in 2013.

==Education==
Moore was a 1947 cum laude graduate of Mercersburg Academy and a 1952 BME graduate of Cornell University. He was a member of the honorary societies Aleph Samach and Quill and Dagger society at Cornell. 
At Mercersburg, he served on the board of regents from 1996 to 2005 and was named the Class of 1932&#x27;s Distinguished Alumnus in 2002.

==Memoir==
In March 2017 Moore published a book recounting his various careers as athlete, business person and philanthropist. &quot;Running on Purpose: Winning Olympic Gold, Advancing Corporate Leadership and Creating Sustainable Value&quot; was co-authored with James Cockerille and published by Edgemoor Ink.

The book is part memoir, providing detail on his upbringing, education and eventual Olympic competition. It is also part business-treatise, detailing numerous turnarounds he led for corporations as well as the athletic department of Cornell. In the last chapter, Moore drew on his athletic orientation and societal impact efforts with Fortune 500 companies. In it he proposed a new form of commercial competitiveness. The challenge he offered is for executives, their boards and investors to embrace a new framework of measurement. Such a framework is not defined, however. Instead Moore proposed a greater integration between the work of pioneering groups in integrated reporting, especially IIRC, and sustainability accounting, like the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Underpinning this &quot;call to action&quot; is a belief that long-term factors must be upheld in the management of a business alongside short-term pressures, and that the balance has dangerously skewed toward short-term thinking. By competing through this universal framework and orienting toward &quot;sustainable value creation&quot;, Moore suggested, corporations could reverse the erosion of trust that leading companies (if not capitalism in general) are experiencing.

In December 2017, Moore published a second book, &quot;One Hurdle at a Time: An Olympian&#x27;s Guide to Clearing Life&#x27;s Obstacles&quot;, intended for a younger audience, approximately ages 8–14. He collaborated with award-winning children&#x27;s author Brad Herzog in an attempt to offer a glimpse into his &quot;race of a lifetime&quot;.

<text>Sihe Bridge is a bridge in Beijing.

It sits on the southern stretch of the 4th Ring Road.

Before the 4th Ring Road signpost change in September 2004, it was named Huaxiang Bridge as it was close to the locality of Huaxiang, which literally means &quot;Flower Village&quot;. It is unknown why the name change took place, especially as the former name was representative—it was named after a village it was situated next to. The official line was that the bridge had its name changed because it took the &quot;recommendations of the local Naming Bureau&quot; (which is a small bureau in charge for naming localities). The &quot;recommendations&quot; as yet remain a mystery.

The only other reason mentioned officially was that the name was &quot;inaccurate&quot;. The former name itself, plus the proximity of Huaxiang, would naturally turn that &quot;reason&quot; on itself immediately.

The new name was already put into use a few days into the ring road sign change, which began on September 5, 2004.

Politically, it is in Fengtai District.

<text>Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture is a 1990 American made-for-television prison drama film written by photojournalist Doug Magee, inspired by his interviews with and photos of death row prisoners. The film was directed by Frank Pierson.

==Plot==
Ray Eames (Arliss Howard) has spent seven years on death row for the shooting of policeman Jackie McGrath in a drug bust gone wrong. His electrocution being finally scheduled, Eames&#x27; last request is for someone to photograph his death. Paul Marish (Roy Scheider) reluctantly takes the job. Upon his arrival at the airport he meets Jake Rusher (Tom Schuster), McGrath&#x27;s former partner. Rusher urges Marish not to take the photo — that it will just re-traumatize those who would rather Eames be forgotten. On the day the execution is scheduled, Marish visits with Eames in his cell while Eames gets his head shaved. Eames is taken to the chair and blindfolded; but at the last moment another reprieve is ordered. Marish leaves the prison that night past sign-waving protesters and counter-protesters. Rusher, among the crowd, is not able to reach Marish&#x27;s car. Rusher returns to his home (which is also the town&#x27;s exotic-pet store), frees the pets, writes &quot;NO JUSTICE&quot; in marker on a crime-scene photograph, and then shoots himself.

Dan Weston (Andre Braugher), a reporter for &quot;Time&quot;, arrives on the scene to cooperate with Marish in getting the story. Weston and Marish visit McGrath&#x27;s widow, Hannah (Bonnie Bedelia), and are present when she and policeman Jerry Brown (Robert Carradine) receive the news that Rusher has killed himself. Finally, Weston and Marish interview D.A. Steve March (Tom Nowicki), who tells them the official story of McGrath&#x27;s murder and reiterates that crimes like Eames&#x27; are &quot;why the death penalty was invented.&quot; Marish replies that &quot;you scare me a hell of a lot more than he does&quot;; the pair are thrown out of March&#x27;s office.

Eames&#x27; latest reprieve expires and he is again scheduled for execution. Marish begins to sense a mystery: Why would Rusher have been so upset as to commit suicide? At the same time, a romance begins to bloom between Marish and Hannah McGrath.

Marish discovers that the crime-scene photograph Rusher left behind was photographically reversed with respect to the photograph used in court, indicating that the bullet that killed McGrath must have come from a different direction. Marish begins to suspect that Eames didn&#x27;t shoot McGrath after all. Assistant D.A. Mike Knighton (Antoni Corone) tells Marish and Weston that Eames&#x27; partner Floyd Tatum (Kevin Quigley) had been a confidential informant, and that he (Knighton) had shot and killed Tatum several years later. Hannah and Marish discover that in fact Tatum is still alive; Rusher had been sending Tatum $1000 a month to maintain his silence. Marish, Hannah, and Brown locate and confront Tatum. He refuses to testify in Eames&#x27; defense, but Marish secretly records Tatum&#x27;s confession. Tatum tells them that Knighton, Rusher, and himself were trafficking drugs. McGrath had discovered their scheme and tried to stop them, and so they had brought in Eames as a patsy; it was actually Rusher who had shot and killed McGrath. Furthermore, Hannah admits, she had been having an affair with Rusher, thus giving him a second motive for the murder — to get rid of her husband.

It is already the evening of Eames&#x27; execution as Hannah and Marish rush back to town. Hannah plays Tatum&#x27;s taped confession for D.A. March and Judge Landis (Harold Bergman), but Landis refuses to give Eames yet another trial on evidence that March characterizes as &quot;hearsay.&quot; Meanwhile, at the prison, Marish tries in vain to stop Eames&#x27; execution, yelling and pounding on the glass of the witnesses&#x27; chamber. It takes two electrical charges to kill Eames. After he is dead, the phone rings — Landis has reprieved Eames too late. Marish shoots photographs of the stunned warden and the witnesses&#x27; confusion. He exits the prison amid fireworks and crowds cheering Eames&#x27; death on the one side and candlelight protesters on the other.

<text>Obatzda (also spelt Obazda and Obatzter) is a Bavarian cheese spread. It is prepared by mixing two thirds aged soft cheese, usually Camembert (Romadur or similar cheeses may be used as well) and one third butter.

Sweet or hot paprika powder, salt and pepper are the traditional seasonings, as well as a small amount of beer. An optional amount of onions, garlic, horseradish, cloves and ground or roasted caraway seeds may be used and some cream or cream cheese as well. The cheeses and spices are mixed together into a more or less smooth mass according to taste. It is usually eaten spread on bread or pretzels. &quot;Obatzda&quot; is a classic example of Bavarian &quot;biergarten&quot; food.

A similar Austrian/Hungarian/Slovak recipe is called &quot;Liptauer&quot; which uses fresh curd cheese as a substitute for the soft cheeses and the butter, but uses about the same spice mix.

In 2015, within the EU, obatzda was granted &quot;PGI&quot; certification.
