<text>Sepura Limited is a British telecommunications equipment provider that develops and supplies radio terminals, accessories and software applications for business and mission critical communications. The company specialises in Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) and LTE (telecommunication) technology.

Headquartered in Cambridge, UK, Sepura has partners supplying the Professional mobile radio market in many countries. Sepura products are used in public safety (including police, fire service and ambulance), public transport, commercial and military sectors.

== History ==
Sepura originated in the Pye company, founded in Cambridge in 1896. William Pye, a trained instrument maker working at Cambridge University Cavendish Laboratory, set up his own business making scientific instruments. He soon built up an international customer base and a reputation for high quality products.

During the First World War Sepura began developing and manufacturing military equipment but after 1921, business began to slow and Pye turned his attention to designing the first commercially successful radio – the ‘700 series’.

Pye also had an interest in television, and in 1930 started developing TV sets and cathode ray tubes. The high point of Pye pre-World War II TV development came with the introduction of the Model 915 TV receiver. By 1939, a full-scale production line had been set up in Cambridge.

With the arrival of the Second World War, UK TV broadcasting was suspended, and the production of the 45 MHz Pye Model 915 TV receiver ceased. Pye then turned its attention to designing and producing radar and wireless equipment for the British Military.

As a developer and manufacturer, Pye produced:

* Domestic radios (1924)
* Televisions (1935)
* Military radios (1939)
* Car radios (1947)
* Police radios (1949)

The mobile radio division of the company, Pye Telecommunications, was taken over by Philips in 1966. By the mid-1990s Philips had decided to pull out of non-core business areas and in 1996 Simoco acquired the Philips PMR business. Sepura was founded in 2002 when it acquired the assets of the TETRA radio business from Simoco.

The following decade saw the TETRA standard gradually adopted, while Sepura saw its business expand from its core UK-based public safety organisations to an international market including oil and gas, transport markets, utilities and mining.

Sepura was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007 and in 2012, the year of its 10th anniversary, the company announced that it had shipped its millionth radio. In the same year, it acquired Austrian infrastructure provider 3T Communications (now Sepura Systems).

In 2013, the company acquired Helsinki-based applications developer, Portalify and launched a range of Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) products, covering UHF and VHF frequency bands. The following year, Sepura acquired Fylde Micro, pioneers in radio trunking, enabling DMR Tier III to be offered as part of their portfolio. 2015 saw the acquisition of Teltronic, a Professional Mobile Radio company, based in Zaragoza, Spain.

In 2016 Sepura ran into financial trouble a result of the acquisition of Teltronic and alleged delay of expected orders. The company incurred a considerable amount of debt following its acquisition of Teltronic. Net debt rose from just 1.1 Million Pounds in 2015 to 119.4 Million Pounds at the end of the 2016 Financial year - additionally Sepura posted a pre tax 19 Million Pound loss for the same period.

Based on the financial issues, Sepura withdrew its DMR range of radios citing at the 2016 AGM &quot;that the board now believes it will not be possible to achieve further market penetration without significant additional investment.&quot;

Sepura&#x27;s share price on the London Stock Exchange subsequently lost 95% of its value, dropping from 200 pence to a low of just 9.7 pence in a 3-month period between July 2016 and September 2016.

Hytera, a Chinese Radio manufacturer, then entered into talks and due diligence to take over the company in November 2016.

On the 16 December 2016, the Sepura board recommended the shareholders accept a bid of 20 pence per share from Hytera as a cash purchase.

In July 2022, London-based private equity group Epiris acquired Sepura.

Ofcom, Britain&#x27;s regulator for UK communications industries, in December 2022 fined Sepura £1.5m for a breach of competition law. In 2018 Sepura and Motorola were in competition for a contract to extend the Airwave digital radio system for police, fire and ambulance services. The regulator found that employees of both companies had exchanged text messages about pricing strategy and likely pricing levels for the new contract.

=== The SRP Series ===

Sepura&#x27;s first TETRA radio was the SRP2000. This set new benchmarks in the industry as it was much smaller and lighter than anything that had gone before.

Developed at a time when the UK Police were going through a uniform re-design, Sepura listened carefully to police users’ requirements to develop a functional secure communications device that was fit-for-purpose. As a result, by mid-2004, the SRP2000 held a remarkable 90% of market share (Radio Comms News, 2012) among UK-based police users.

The SRP2000 resembled a GSM phone of the day, rather than a traditional portable radio and, for the first time, it was a radio designed to be worn on the user&#x27;s lapel rather than on the belt.

This was significant, because a lapel-worn radio negated the need for a remote speaker microphone and removed a sizeable weight from the user&#x27;s belt – a factor which was thought to contribute to lumbar strain and a significant number of absences from work.

In 2005, Sepura partnered with QinetiQ to deploy the first use of Super Sensitive GPS for TETRA users, known as sGPS. This move saw the SRP series updated to become the SRH series.

=== The SRH Series ===

(SRH3500, SRH3800, SRH3900)&lt;br&gt;
The SRH3500 was, in many ways, a groundbreaking TETRA radio on account of its diminutive dimensions; it remains one of the smallest and lightest TETRA radios ever to be put in mass production. Together with its sister radio, the SRH3800, it was adopted by police, ambulance and fire and rescue services worldwide.

The radios’ popularity within the ‘blue light’ community meant that Sepura was frequently asked to supply dummy radios to film and TV production crews around the world, to add to the authenticity of their productions. As a result, Sepura radios have made appearances on well-known programmes such as Eastenders and Coronation Street, as well as crime re-enactments and real life ‘police action’ documentaries.

=== The STP8000 Series ===

(STP8000, STP8100, STP8200)&lt;br&gt;
Climate change was one of the key drivers behind Sepura&#x27;s next launch, the STP8000 series. Launched in 2008, it was designed to cope with heavy downpours – rather than light showers, as had previously been the accepted industry standard.

The 8000 series was designed to cope with the needs of the search and rescue users in the jungles of Malaysia; frozen winters experienced by Swedish Police and fire services; and downpours and floods that were occurring in many parts of the world.

The STP8000 was the start of Sepura&#x27;s new genre of tough, go-anywhere TETRA radios, that not only appealed to the world&#x27;s emergency services, but gained a whole new range of users, keen to take advantage of its ruggedness.

As a result, the STP8000 was complemented by the STP8100 (launched 2009) and STP8200 (launched 2010), designed for use in the mines of Australia and oil and gas installations around the globe.

===SRG3900===
Launched in 2010, the SRG3900 was a popular addition to Sepura&#x27;s range, providing 10 watts of RF power, and gateway and repeater technology to extend communication into areas otherwise beyond network coverage. It had the greatest operational range of any TETRA terminal on the contemporary market and was deployed everywhere from ski resorts to mines and chemical parks.

It was launched in conjunction with the Sepura Colour Console (SCC), whose large, high-resolution colour screen allowed the display of high quality photographs and maps.

=== The STP9000 Series ===

(STP9000, STP9100, STP9200)&lt;br&gt;
In 2011, during trials for the London Olympics, TETRA radios were exposed to salt-laden environments, which were seen to quickly cause corrosion to connectors. In response to this and other new challenges, the STP9000 series drew on the ‘tough technology’ developed for the STP8X and went one step further, being designed to be not just waterproof, but fully submersible. It was resistant to heavy salt mist and included a new ‘Connector Protector’ technology that guarded it against direct exposure to salt water.

The STP9000 was also the first TETRA radio to feature Haptic Technology, significantly improving its key response for users working in heavy gloves.

=== The STP8X Series ===

(STP8X000, STP8X100)&lt;br&gt;
As a result of this new user base, demand for an Intrinsically Safe variant of the STP8000 was growing. In March 2011 the STP8X100 series, Sepura&#x27;s first Intrinsically Safe radio, was launched.

Certified by Baseefa to version 6 of the IECEx and ATEX standards the STP8X100 series exceeded the requirements of the rigorous highly accelerated life test stipulated by the specifications: one month held at 85 °C and 90% humidity followed by one day at −25 °C to −30 °C, before being impact tested, drop tested, water-ingress tested and finally vacuum-assisted dust-ingress tested in a chamber for two hours.

=== The SC Series ===
Launched in May 2015, the SC20 was promoted as ‘The next generation’ of hand-portable radios, offering optional high-speed data connectivity, connectivity to body-worn data accessories and a Linux operating system to enable a wider applications capability. Submersible, waterproof and dustproof, SC20 radios passed IP66, IP67 and IP68 environmental protection ratings and were designed with an easy-clean design, allowing them to be rinsed in running water.

In May 2017, the more compact SC21 hand-held radio launched offering the same functionality as the SC20 but in a smaller radio terminal.

In June 2019, the SCG22 mobile radio was launched.

In June 2022 to enable more mining users to use Sepura TETRA radios, the SC20, SC21 and SCG22 were also made available in VHF, operating within 136-174MHz.

=== The SCU3 Broadband Vehicle Device ===

The first of Sepura&#x27;s mission critical LTE products, the SCU3 Broadband Vehicle Device was launched at Critical Communications World Conference and Exhibition in November, 2021. Designed to provide both mission critical voice and access to high speed data, the SCU3 was built on an Android operating system, supporting Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and Ethernet to provide connections to a wide range of accessories, apps and systems. 

The SCU3 received certification from the Global Certification Forum(GCF) in February 2022, meeting the GCF&#x27;s technical requirements for interoperability of wireless devices.

It also offers an optional TETRA Module, supporting Direct Mode in the 380-473MHz band for users wanted to use both TETRA and LTE networks.

<doc id="968037" wikidata="Q7673957" url="?curid=968037" title="Taco Bell chihuahua">
<text>Gidget (February 7, 1994 – July 21, 2009), nicknamed the Taco Bell Chihuahua, was an advertising figure and mascot for Taco Bell from September 1997 to July 2000. The character she played was developed by TBWA. The Chihuahua is a breed commonly associated with Mexico.

==History==
In September 1997, Taco Bell used the dog in one advertisement in the Northeastern United States. The advertising campaign began during a peak in the Burger wars, in which several fast food chains were engaged in a large advertisement competition against each other. The dog was made to speak through special effects. Her advertising catchphrase was &quot;¡Yo quiero Taco Bell!&quot; (&quot;I want Taco Bell!&quot;). Her voice was provided by Carlos Alazraqui, who says that the voice is a cross between Hungarian-born actor Peter Lorre (&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;) and Ren Höek, the cartoon chihuahua from &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (who in turn was also based on Lorre), with a touch of Anthony Quinn from &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;. The dog also started two additional catchphrases: &quot;Yeah, drop the Chalupa!&quot; (which briefly became an oft-quoted phrase on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;) and &quot;Viva Gorditas!&quot; In a noted crossover with the 1998 &quot;Godzilla&quot; film, the dog tried to trap the monster in a box, goading the beast with the phrase, &quot;Here, lizard, lizard, lizard!&quot;, only to see Godzilla&#x27;s size and respond, &quot;Uh-oh, I think I need a bigger box.&quot; (a reference to &quot;Jaws&quot;), and another Godzilla crossover involving him making an order through a drive-thru speaker on Godzilla&#x27;s tail, making an order too large for the workers.

==Popularity==
The figure grew popular, so much so that talking toy figures of the dog were produced and sold at Taco Bell locations during 1998 to 1999, as well as other versions at other stores, and &quot;Yo quiero (X)&quot; became a recognized piece of popular culture.

==Controversies==
Some Latin Americans accused the dog of being a cultural stereotype. Commercials that depicted the dog as a bandido with a sombrero or as a revolutionary wearing a beret (similar to the one famously worn by Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara) were seen as particularly insensitive. Mario G. Obledo, a civil rights leader, called for a boycott of Taco Bell if the company did not end the ad campaign.

In July 2000, Taco Bell ended the chihuahua advertisements, ended its relationship with their creator TBWA, and replaced the company&#x27;s president, after same-store sales fell by 6% in the second quarter of 2000, the largest such decline in Taco Bell history. It was incorrectly rumored that Taco Bell ended the commercials because the dog died. Voice actor Tom Kenny, who is a friend of Alazraqui, said that Hispanic advocacy groups lobbying for the end of the campaign led to the cancelation of the Taco Bell dog. Other reports say the use of the dog was discontinued because it failed to increase Taco Bell&#x27;s revenue stream in spite of the dog&#x27;s popularity.

===Lawsuit===
In 2003, Taco Bell lost a lawsuit by two Michigan men, who had pitched the concept of the Chihuahua to Taco Bell in 1996 at a Licensing Show in NYC. Taco Bell worked with Thomas Rinks and Joseph Shields for over a year developing the Chihuahua campaign and commercials under the name &quot;Psycho Chihuahua&quot;, but Taco Bell failed to pay the men according to court documents. The men sued and, in 2003, a jury awarded them $30.1 million in compensation plus nearly $12 million in additional interest three months later. Taco Bell in turn sued TBWA saying it should have been aware of the conflicts. In 2009, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled against Taco Bell.

==Further career==
In later years, Gidget appeared in a 2002 commercial for insurance company GEICO, again as the Taco Bell Chihuahua, and as &quot;Bruiser&#x27;s Mom&quot; in the 2003 movie &quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White &amp; Blonde&quot;.

==Death==
Gidget died on July 21, 2009, at age 15 after having suffered a stroke in the home of her trainer Sue Chipperton in Santa Clarita, California. She was cremated, and her ashes were retained by her trainer. Taco Bell Corp. said in a statement that Gidget would be missed by many fans and said: &quot;Our deepest sympathies go out to her owners and fans.&quot;

<text>The Pacific Islands Chapter of the [[Internet Society]] (PICISOC) serves the Internet Society’s purposes by serving the interests of the global Internet community through its presence in the Pacific Islands. In addition to ISOC interests, PICISOC also focuses on local issues and developments and acts as an impartial advisor to governments and the public on matters of significant interest to Pacific Island people concerning the Internet and ICT technology in general.

== History ==
IT-PacNet was created in 1994 to see what ICT developments were being made by FFA and SOPAC, two regional organisations operating in the Pacific. This meant comparing notes, implementations, and success stories. The meeting was informal and technical in nature. FFA&#x27;s IT manager at the time was Sam Taufao, and SOPAC&#x27;s IT manager was Leslie Allinson. It was agreed that more organisations should be brought into the group the following year. Slowly, it became apparent that the countries needed to be part of the process, and IT-PacNet evolved into a meeting of IT administrators and managers from the Pacific region.

At around the same time, Sam Taufao (then working for FFA) came back from a meeting sponsored by UNESCO and recommended the creation of PICISOC-the Pacific Islands Chapter of the Internet Society. IT-PacNet slowly evolved into a CROP (Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific) ICT Working Group and concentrated more on dealing with CROP policies. Meanwhile, PICISOC grew, and by 2002, a board and executive were in place. The general assembly&#x27;s (annual meetings) became bigger, and thus PacINET was born, and has since evolved to become the premier ICT conference for the Pacific region. PacINET was able to re-group most of the original functions of IT-PacNet, creating an event where anyone could speak freely and share views on ICT/Internet for any organisation (government, the private sector, etc.) or as an individual.

PICISOC&#x27;s focus is on ICT and Internet issues for the Pacific Islands region, and it works with various organisations and governments to ensure the continuing development of ICT in the region.

<doc id="968046" wikidata="Q84556" url="?curid=968046" title="Alfred Redl">
<text>Alfred Redl (14 March 1864 – 25 May 1913) was an Austro-Hungarian military officer who rose to head the &quot;Evidenzbureau&quot;, the counterintelligence wing of the General Staff of the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was one of the leading figures of pre-World War I espionage; his term in office was marked by radical innovations and the use of advanced technology to ensnare foreign spies.

Due to the innovations he introduced, Redl&#x27;s successor, Major Maximilian Ronge, ultimately learned in 1913 that Redl himself was also a highly paid spy, working for the intelligence service of the Imperial Russian Army. Upon being exposed as a Russian spy, Redl committed suicide.

Redl&#x27;s homosexuality was publicized during the investigation, and it has been debated whether his sexuality or the money he received was related to his decision to spy. He may have been enticed by the material benefits. Redl&#x27;s revelations did not have a significant effect on the course of the war, although the changes for Gallica by Conrad who changed the attack in August 1914 from eastern to western Gallica did have serious consequences according to Buttar.

==Early career==
Alfred Redl was born on 14 March 1864 in the city Lemberg, located in the Austrian Empire (now the Ukrainian city of Lviv). He came from a relatively poor family, his father being a railway clerk.

At the age of fifteen Redl entered the Karthaus Military Academy in Brno, as a cadet. In 1883 he graduated as a cadet officer, rated as having had a very good record. He then served with the Infantry Regiment No. 9 stationed in Lemberg reaching the rank of lieutenant.

Despite lacking the advantages of wealth or family connections, Redl rose quickly within the officer ranks of the Austro-Hungarian Army. He attended the War School in Vienna, which normally accepted only fifty entrants a year from about a thousand applicants. Acquiring a specialist interest in Russian military issues, Redl joined the Intelligence Bureau of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, and was assigned to the Russian Section in 1900.

==Counter-intelligence work==
By 1907, Redl had become head of the counter-intelligence branch of the Intelligence Bureau. Promoted to the rank of colonel, he greatly improved the methods used by the Austro-Hungarian counter-intelligence service, introducing such technological innovations as the use of cameras and primitive recording devices, while creating a database of fingerprint records for persons of interest. However, at the same time, Redl himself became a spy for Russia and his subsequent exposure was largely due to the improvements he had developed himself.

==Treason==
Redl&#x27;s motives for treason are still unclear. He may have been caught in a compromising position by Russian agents, because he was homosexual and being exposed as such would have been fatal to his career prospects. In fact, Colonel Nikolai Baryushin of Russian military intelligence, based in Warsaw (Congress Poland) at the time, had discovered Redl&#x27;s homosexuality as early as 1901, information that was used to blackmail him into revealing classified information. However it has been claimed that recent results from Russian archives do not support this.

In 1902, Redl reportedly passed a copy of Austro-Hungarian war plans to the Russians. General von Gieslingen, head of the Intelligence Bureau, delegated Redl himself to investigate the source of this leak. In consultation with his Russian contacts, Redl identified several low-level agents as Russian spies, thereby protecting himself and enhancing his reputation for efficiency.

Redl was paid well by the Russian government for his services, and acquired a lifestyle far beyond what his official salary could cover; explained by references to family/inheritance. He owned several expensive automobiles, several apartments in Vienna and a house in Prague. It would appear that there was also a strong element of vanity involved, as well as a taste for danger. A Russian report of 1907 describes Redl as &quot;more sly and false than intelligent and talented&quot;, a cynic &quot;who enjoys dissipation.&quot; Buttar says he was paid the equivalent today of $3.8 million (£2.4 million) by Russia, plus additional money from the French and Italians.

From 1903 to 1913, Redl was Russia&#x27;s leading spy. Before World War I, he provided the Russians with information of Plan III, the entire Austro-Hungarian invasion plan for Serbia. The Russians then informed the Serbian military command about Plan III. As a result, when the Austro-Hungarian Army invaded Serbia, the Serbians were well prepared. Redl not only provided many of his country&#x27;s military secrets and plans, but he also supplied incorrect estimates of Russian military strength to his own military authorities.

Redl is thought to have sold to Russia one of Austria-Hungary&#x27;s principal attack plans, along with its order of battle, its mobilization plans (at a time when mobilization was viewed as one of the critical keys to victory) and detailed plans of Austrian fortifications that were soon overrun by Russia. He is known beyond question to have sent Austro-Hungarian agents into Russia only to sell them out to protect himself. He also had Austro-Hungarian agents within the Russian Imperial Staff but betrayed them too, to be hanged or to commit suicide. He is also believed to have informed on various Russian officers who contacted Austro-Hungarian intelligence.

== Exposure ==
In 1912, Redl became chief of staff of the VIII Corps under his old commander, Arthur Giesl von Gieslingen. When he left the counter-intelligence service, Redl was succeeded by Major Maximilian Ronge, a man trained by Redl himself. Ronge instigated the practice of checking suspicious mail. One suspect envelope – a poste restante was discovered. It contained a significant amount of money and included references to several addresses known to be used for espionage activities.

On 9 May 1913, a duplicate letter with money was posted to the same cover name, &quot;Nikon Nizetas&quot;. Police detectives were assigned to monitor the post office and follow whoever claimed it. When the letter was finally claimed on 24 May, police pursued, but lost contact when the person who had picked up the letter left in a taxi. But while the detectives stood wondering what to do, the taxi that the suspect had taken returned. The detectives took the taxi and asked to be driven to the address that the previous customer had been taken to, which turned out to be the Hotel Klomser. During the ride there, they found a pen-knife sheath. Arriving at the hotel, the detectives told the management to ask the guests if any of them had lost the sheath and then waited in the lobby. When a guest arrived to claim it, the detectives recognized their former boss, Colonel Alfred Redl.

Redl was subsequently confronted in his apartment by a party of military officers. In the course of a brief interrogation he admitted selling military intelligence to a foreign power. Field Marshal Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, the army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, ordered that Redl was to be left alone with a loaded revolver. Redl shot himself in the early morning of 25 May 1913.

== Legacy ==
Redl&#x27;s death was regretted both by Emperor Franz Josef, who would have preferred that the colonel avoided dying in mortal sin, and by the intelligence service, which would have preferred to interrogate him on the full extent of his disclosures to the Russians. In the political post-mortem one newspaper noted that &quot;the Redl affair cannot be seen as a private matter. Redl is not an individual but a system. Whilst soldiers elsewhere are taught to love their homelands, lack of patriotism is held to be the greatest military virtue in this unfortunate monarchy. With us military education culminates in all national feeling being driven out of our soldiers... In the Redl affair this spirit has had its revenge. The Austrian and the Hungarian soldiers possess no fatherland; they only have a war lord.&quot;

In 1950, senator McCarthy brought up the case of Alfred Redl in an influential speech at the outset of the Lavender Scare, in which gay employees of the State Department were fired. McCarthy believed the Redl case illustrated that &quot;the pervert is easy prey to the blackmailer,&quot; and that therefore homosexuals should be banned from working for the State Department. &quot;We’re not disturbed about them because of their morals, but because they are dangerous to this country,&quot; McCarthy concluded.

==In popular culture==
* Historian Robert B. Asprey wrote &quot;The Panther&#x27;s Feast&quot; about Redl.
* John Osborne&#x27;s 1965 play &quot;A Patriot for Me&quot; is based on Redl&#x27;s story.
* A summary of Redl&#x27;s career and its effect on the course of World War I is provided by Dennis Wheatley in his historical novel &quot;The Second Seal&quot; (1950). Redl&#x27;s successor, Ronge, also appears as himself – chief of Austro-Hungarian Intelligence. He is trying to foil the attempts of British Intelligence to find out what Austria intends for Serbia in 1914.

<doc id="968047" wikidata="Q4667150" url="?curid=968047" title="Abernethy Bridge">
<text>The George Abernethy Bridge, or simply Abernethy Bridge, is a steel plate and box girder bridge that spans the Willamette River between Oregon City and West Linn, Oregon, United States, and which carries Interstate 205. It is also known as the Oregon City Freeway Bridge and the I-205 Bridge.

The bridge was dedicated and opened on May 28, 1970, and cost $17.1 million to construct. It is named for George Abernethy, who was the governor of the Provisional Government of the Oregon Country from 1845 to 1849 and later an Oregon City businessman. An approximately $7 million seismic retrofit began in 2000 and was completed in 2002. In 2008, the average traffic was 95,500 vehicles per day.

==Description==
The bridge structure contains 15 spans and 60 girders. The total length is , and the vertical clearance at low river levels is . The longest span is and is sandwiched by two spans. The bridge carries six lanes of traffic (three in each direction—two through lanes, and one merging lane). Interchanges are located at each end of the bridge: On the western end (in West Linn) is an interchange with Oregon Route 43; on the eastern end (in Oregon City) is an interchange with OR 99E. The bridge is somewhat unusual in that its western approach is located on a bluff overlooking the river, whereas the eastern end is located in a lowland just south of the confluence of the Willamette and Clackamas rivers; as a result, westbound traffic on I-205 travels uphill the entire length of the bridge, and continues uphill for another half-mile before the freeway summits and heads back downhill, into the lower Tualatin River basin.

==History==

Construction of a new east–west bridge between West Linn and Oregon City was approved by the Oregon State Highway Commission in January 1964. The proposed bridge was later incorporated into the plans for I-205 in 1965 after it was relocated away from a routing through Lake Oswego. Construction began in early 1968 and was completed on May 28, 1970, at a cost of $17.1 million; it was originally scheduled to open in December 1969. Several West Linn citizens staged an unofficial &quot;opening&quot; on April 1 to jokingly dedicate the bridge as the &quot;West Linn Bridge&quot;. The city later changed its seal to include a depiction of the bridge.

In 2009, the Oregon Department of Transportation spent $7 million to repave the roadway and replace the expansion joints on the bridge.

In 2017, the Oregon Department of Transportation launched a project to widen I-205 to three lanes between the Abernethy Bridge and Stafford Road. Part of the proposed plan includes removing the Highway 43 to I-205 northbound onramp and widening the Abernethy Bridge. The cost of the project increased to $600 million in 2024 and required additional funding to cover a $300 million gap created by higher construction costs and the cancellation of tolling on I-205.

<text>That Was Then is an American drama television series that was broadcast on ABC September 27 to October 4, 2002. It was cancelled after only two episodes had aired.

==Synopsis==
The series starred James Bulliard as Travis Glass, a 30-year-old who finds his life in a rut. Still living at home with his mother (Bess Armstrong) he works as a door-to-door salesman. The girl of his dreams, played by Kiele Sanchez, is married to his older brother, Gregg, played by Brad Raider. Travis is able to trace his life&#x27;s downward spiral to a single week in high school in 1988. After telling his best friend, played by Tyler Labine, that he wished for a second chance to make everything right, he lies in bed listening to the song &quot;Do It Again&quot; by The Kinks, when a bolt of lightning hits his house, and an electrical jolt sends him back to that week in 1988. Glass tries to correct things that originally went wrong, but finds his new life isn&#x27;t quite to his expectations, and must return from the past.

It was compared to The WB series with a similar premise, &quot;Do Over&quot;.

<doc id="968055" wikidata="Q2991265" url="?curid=968055" title="Polymicrogyria">
<text>Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a condition that affects the development of the human brain by multiple small gyri (microgyri) creating excessive folding of the brain leading to an abnormally thick cortex. This abnormality can affect either one region of the brain or multiple regions.

The time of onset has yet to be identified; however, it has been found to occur before birth in either the earlier or later stages of brain development. Early stages include impaired proliferation and migration of neuroblasts, while later stages show disordered post-migration development.

The symptoms experienced differ depending on what part of the brain is affected. There is no specific treatment to get rid of this condition, but there are medications that can control the symptoms such as seizures, delayed development or weakened muscles as some of the noted effects.

== Syndromes ==
Significant technological advances have been made within the past few decades that have allowed more extensive studies to be made regarding syndromes from conditions such as polymicrogyria. Research, imaging, and analysis has shown that distribution of polymicrogyria does not always appear to be random, which revealed different types polymicrogyria. A summary of clinical manifestations of each syndrome can be found below, in the section labelled &quot;Clinical presentation&quot;.

The main patterns of polymicrogyria are: perisylvian (61%), generalised (13%), frontal (5%), and parasagittal parieto-occipital (3%) and 11% is associated with gray matter heterotopia (grey matter is located in the white matter instead of usual location in the cerebral cortex).

=== Bilateral frontal polymicrogyria (BFP) ===
BFP appears to be a symmetrical polymicrogyria that extends anteriorly from the frontal poles to the posterior precentral gyrus, and inferiorly to the frontal operculum. Patients who had polymicrogyria distribution similar to this also experienced similar symptoms including delayed motor and language developments, spastic hemiparesis or quadriparesis, and forms of mild intellectual disability.

=== Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) ===
BFPP was one of the first discovered forms of polymicrogyria to have a gene identified linking to the syndromes caused. This gene is called GPR56. Symmetrical distribution is also evident in this form, but more distinctly, patients with BFPP were found to have atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem, as well as bilateral white matter abnormalities. BFPP is characterized by esotropia, global development delay, pyramidal signs, cerebral signs, and seizures. Esotropia is also known as dysconjugate gaze, and is a common feature of severe static encephalopathy. This differentiates BFPP from the other bilateral polymicrogyria syndromes.

=== Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) ===
BPP is similar to the other types of polymicrogyria in that it is usually symmetrical, but BPP can vary among patients. BPP is characterized by its location; the cerebral cortex deep in the sylvian fissures is thickened and abnormally infolded, as well as the sylvian fissures extending more posteriorly up to the parietal lobes and more vertically oriented. BPP has been classified into a grading system consisting of four different grades that describe the variations in severity:

The grades move from most severe (Grade 1) to least severe (Grade 4). Although BFPP was the first form of polymicrogyria to be discovered, BPP was the first form to be described and is also the most common form of polymicrogyria. The clinical characterizations of BPP &quot;include pseudobulbar palsy with diplegia of the facial, pharyngeal and masticory muscles (facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory paresis), pyramidal signs, and seizures.&quot; These can result in drooling, feeding issues, restricted tongue movement, and dysarthria. Disorders in language development have also been associated with BPP, but the extent of language disorder depends on the severity of cortical damage. Patients who have BPP can also have pyramidal signs that vary in severity, and can be either unilateral or bilateral.

The sodium channel SCN3A has been implicated in BPP.

=== Bilateral parasagittal parieto-occipital polymicrogyria (BPOP) ===
BPOP is located in the parasagittal and mesial regions of the parieto-occipital cortex. This form has been associated with IQ scores that range from average intelligence to mild intellectual disability, seizures, and cognitive slowing. The age of seizure onset has been found to occur anywhere from 20 months to 15 years, and in most cases the seizures were intractable (meaning hard to control).

=== Bilateral generalised polymicrogyria (BGP) ===
BGP is most severe in the perisylvian regions, but occurs in a generalised distribution. Associated factors include a reduced volume of white matter and ventriculomegaly. BGP tends to show excessively folded and fused gyri of an abnormally thin cerebral cortex, and an absence of the normal six-layered structure. The abnormally thin cortex is a key factor that distinguishes this form of polymicrogyria from the others, which are characterized by an abnormally thick cortex. Most of the patients have cognitive and motor delay, spastic hemi- or quadriparesis, and seizures in varying degrees. The seizures also vary at age of onset, type, and severity. There have been pseudobulbar signs reported with BGP, which are also seen in patients with BPP. This association leads to the belief that there is overlap between patients with BGP and patients with grade 1 BPP.

=== Unilateral polymicrogyria ===
The region in which unilateral polymicrogyria occurs has been generalized into different cortical areas. Features associated with this form of polymicrogyria are similar to the other forms and include spastic hemiparesis, intellectual disability in variable degrees, and seizures. The features depend on the exact area and extent to which polymicrogyria has affected the cortex. Patients who have unilateral polymicrogyria have been reported to also have electrical status epilepticus during sleep (EPES), and all had seizures.

==Signs and symptoms==
The diagnosis of PMG is merely descriptive and is not a disease in itself, nor does it describe the underlying cause of the brain malformation.

Polymicrogyria may be just one piece of a syndrome of developmental abnormalities, because children born with it may have a wide spectrum of other problems, including global developmental disabilities, mild to severe intellectual disabilities, motor dysfunctions including speech and swallowing problems, respiratory problems, seizures. Though it is difficult to make a predictable prognosis for children with the diagnosis of PMG, there are some generalized clinical findings according to the areas of the brain that are affected.
* Bilateral frontal polymicrogyria (BFP) – Cognitive and motor delay, spastic quadriparesis, epilepsy
* Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP) – Severe cognitive and motor delay, seizures, dysconjugate gaze, cerebellar dysfunction
* Bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria (BPP) – Pseudobulbar signs, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, some with arthrogryposis or lower motor neuron disease
* Bilateral parasagittal parieto-occipital polymicrogyria (BPPP) – Partial seizures, some with intellectual developmental disorder
* Bilateral generalized polymicrogyria (BGP) – Cognitive and motor delay of variable severity, seizures

Rates of symptoms in PMG include 78% for epilepsy, 70% for global developmental delay, 51% for spasticity, 50% for microcephaly, 45% for dysmorphic features (e.g., abnormal facies or hand, feet, or digital anomalies), and 5% for macrocephaly. In the BPP subtype of PMG, up to 75% may have mild to moderate intellectual disability.

==Cause==
The cause of polymicrogyria is unclear. It is generally agreed that PMG occurs during late neuronal migration (when majority of the neurons arrived at cerebral cortex after their starting points around the ventricular system of the brain) or early cortical organization of fetal development. Evidence for both genetic and non-genetic causes exists.

Chromosomal abnormalities have been identified in PMG such as 22q11.2 deletion (characterised by bilateral perisylvian PMG, heart defects, facial dysmorphism, microcephaly) and 1p36 deletion (bilateral perisylvian PMG, intellectual disability, dysmorphic facial features and microcephaly). Apart from that, mutations in more than 30 genes have been associated with PMG. Common genes associated with PMG are TUBA1A and PIK3R2. Association with the gene WDR62 (diffuse or asymmetric PMG) and SCN3A has also been identified, as well as other ion channels such as KCN, CACNA, GRIN, and GABAR. Other genes implicated are: GPR56 (Bilateral frontoparietal PMG), TUBB2B (anterior predominant PMG), NDE1 (Diffuse PMG), AKT3 (Bilateral perisylvian PMG), and PIK3CA (Bilateral perisylvian PMG).

Non-genetic causes include defects in placental oxygenation and in association with congenital infections, particularly cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and varicella zoster virus.

== Pathology ==
Polymicrogyria is a disorder of neuronal migration, resulting in structurally abnormal cerebral hemispheres. The Greek roots of the name describe its salient feature: many [poly] small [micro] gyri (convolutions in the surface of the brain). It is also characterized by shallow sulci, a slightly thicker cortex, neuronal heterotopia and enlarged ventricles. When many of these small folds are packed tightly together, PMG may resemble pachygyria (a few &quot;thick folds&quot; - a mild form of lissencephaly).

The pathogenesis of polymicrogyria is still being researched for understanding though it is historically heterogeneous-4. It results from both genetic and destructive events. While polymicrogyria is associated with genetic mutations, none of these are the sole cause of this abnormality. The cortical development of mammals requires specific cell functions that all involve microtubules, whether it is because of mitosis, specifically cell division, cell migration or neurite growth. Some mutations that affect the role of microtubules and are studied as possible contributors, but not causes, to polymicrogyria include TUBA1A and TUBB2B. TUBB2B mutations are known to contribute to polymicrogyria either with or without congenital fibrosis or the external ocular muscles, as well as bilateral perisylvian.
The gene GPR56 is a member of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor family and is directly related to causing Bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria, (BFPP)-6. Other genes in the G protein-coupled receptor family have effects with this condition as well such as the outer brain development, but not enough is known to carry out all the research properly so the main focus is starting with the specific GR56 gene within this category. This malformation of the brain is a result of numerous small gyri taking over the surface of the brain that should otherwise be normally convoluted. This gene is currently under studies to help identify and contribute to the knowledge about this condition. It is studied to provide information on the causes along with insight into the mechanisms of normal cortical development and the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex using magnetic resonance imagine, MRI. Specifically found to polymicrogyria due to mutation of this gene are myelination defects. GPR56 is observed to be important for myelinations due to a mutation in this gene results in reduced white matter volume and signal changes as shown in MRI&#x27;s. While the cellular roles of GPR56 in myelination remains unclear, this information will be used to further other studies done with this gene.

Another gene that has been associated with this condition is GRIN1 and GRIN2B.

==Diagnosis==
The effects of PMG can be either focal or widespread. Although both can have physiological effects on the patient, it is hard to determine PMG as the direct cause because it can be associated with other brain malformations. Most commonly, PMG is associated with Aicardi and Warburg micro syndromes. These syndromes both have frontoparieto polymicrogyria as their anomalies. To ensure proper diagnosis, doctors thus can examine a patient through neuroimaging or neuropathological techniques.

===Neuroimaging techniques===
Pathologically, PMG is defined as &quot;an abnormally thick cortex formed by the piling upon each other of many small gyri with a fused surface.&quot; To view these microscopic characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used. First physicians must distinguish between polymicrogyria and pachygyria. Pachygria leads to the development of broad and flat regions in the cortical area, whereas the effect of PMG is the formation of multiple small gyri. Underneath a computerized tomography (CT scan) scan, these both appear similar in that the cerebral cortex appears thickened. However, MRI with a T1 weighted inversion recovery will illustrate the gray-white junction that is characterized by patients with PMG. An MRI is also usually preferred over the CT scan because it has sub-millimeter resolution. The resolution displays the multiple folds within the cortical area, which is continuous with the neuropathology of an infected patient.

===Neuropathological techniques===
Gross examination exposes a pattern of many small gyri clumped together, which causes an irregularity in the brain surface. The cerebral cortex, which in normal patients is six cell layers thick, is also thinned. As mentioned prior, the MRI of an affected patient shows what appears to be a thickening of the cerebral cortex because of the tiny folds that aggregate causing a more dense appearance. However, gross analysis shows that an affected patient can have as few as one to all six of these layers missing.

==Treatment==
The PMG malformation cannot be reversed, but the symptoms can be treated. The removal of affected areas through hemispherectomy has been used in some cases to reduce the amount a seizure activity. Few patients are candidates for surgery. The global developmental delay that affects 94% can also be mitigated in some patients with occupational, physical, and speech therapies. The important aspect to realize is PMG affects each patient differently and treatment options and mitigation techniques will vary. Many services are available to help, most children&#x27;s hospitals can direct caregivers guidance where to get the information they need to seek assistance.

== Epidemiology ==
The incidences of PMG and its different forms are unknown. However, the frequency of cortical dysplasia in general has been estimated to be 1 in 2,500 newborns. PMG is one of the best-known and most common malformations of cortical development, accounting for 20% of all cases. In the largest series of PMG cases, the bilateral perisylvian pattern was the most common topological pattern (52% of cases) followed by the unilateral perisylvian pattern (9% of cases).

== History ==
Limited information was known about cerebral disorders until the development of modern technologies. Brain imaging and genetic sequencing greatly increased the information known about polymicrogyria within the past decade. Understanding about development, classification and localization of the disorder have greatly improved. For instance, localization of specific cortex regions affected by the disease was determined. This allowed for clinical symptoms of patients to be linked with localized cortex areas affected. A gene that was identified to be a contributor to bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria was GPR56.

==Design and development==
The A.18 was designed by Antonin Vlasák and Antonin Husnik and first flew in March 1923; only one of three prototype fighters that Aero flew that year, but this one was selected for production over the A.19 and A.20 that competed with it.

==Operational history==
Twenty machines saw service with the Czechoslovak Air Force in the period between the wars.

The A.18B and A.18C were specially modified racing variants that competed in the Czech Aero Club&#x27;s first two annual air races, in 1923 and 1924 respectively. Both aircraft won their races, and the A.18C is preserved at the Prague Aviation Museum in Kbely along with a replica of a standard A.18 fighter.

==History==
The name of the district is probably derived from &quot;Bhil Thana&quot; (place of Bhils, a tribal group).

Buldhana, along with the rest of Berar Province, was part of the Vidarbha kingdom mentioned in the Mahabharata, a Sanskrit epic poem. Berar formed a part of the Maurya Empire during the reign of Ashoka (272–231 BCE). Berar came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty (2nd century BCE–2nd century CE), the Vakataka dynasty (3rd to 6th centuries), the Chalukya dynasty (6th to 8th centuries), the Rashtrakuta Dynasty (8th to 10th centuries), the Chalukyas again (10th to 12th centuries), and finally the Yadava dynasty of Devagiri (late 12th to early 14th centuries).

A period of Muslim rule began when Alauddin Khalji, the Sultan of Delhi conquered the region in the early 14th century. The region was part of the Bahmani Sultanate, which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the mid-14th century. The Bahmani Sultanate broke up into smaller sultanates at the end of the 15th century. In 1572, Berar became part of the Nizam Shahi sultanate, based at Ahmednagar. The Nizam Shahis ceded Berar to the Mughal Empire in 1595. As Mughal rule started to unravel at the start of the 18th century, Asaf Jah I, the Nizam of Hyderabad, seized the southern provinces of the empire in 1724, forming an independent state. Berar was a part of the independent state.

In 1853, the whole district came under the administration of the British East India Company. Berar was divided into East and West Berar with Buldhana district being included in West Berar. In 1903, Berar was leased by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the British Government of India. Thus, Berar became part of Central Provinces. In 1950, it became part of Madhya Pradesh with Nagpur as its capital. In 1956, along with other Marathi-speaking regions of Vidarbha, it became part of the newly formed state Maharashtra in 1960.

<text>The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA) is a federally focused student advocacy organization. CASA currently has 24 members, who represent over 275,000 students from across Canada. With a formal partnership with the Quebec Student Union, CASA represents 365,000 students. CASA works towards an accessible, affordable, innovative and high-quality post-secondary education system.

==History==
CASA&#x27;s origins can be traced to the first Winds of Change conference hosted by the University of Alberta in 1990. In what would become an annual meeting, student leaders from across the country were invited to come together to discuss challenges facing post-secondary education students in Canada.

In 1993, the federal government announced that all of Canada&#x27;s social programs would be reviewed. Sweeping and significant changes were likely to come, which prompted several student unions not affiliated with the Canadian Federation of Students to try to organize efforts to lobby the federal government on education issues.

In 1994, as the result of a conference held at Carleton University, a number of student leaders decided to form a new Canadian post-secondary student organization. The foundations for the new organization were laid down, and the framework for a constitution was built upon it.

In 1998, Patrick Fitzpatrick, then acting Director of CASA, pled guilty to fraud charges after it was discovered that he embezzled money from the organization.

In 2003, Liam Arbuckle, then National Director, resigned after it was alleged that he provided confidential information to a candidate hoping to succeed him.

CASA was incorporated June 27, 1995. CASA currently has members in seven provinces and represents undergraduate, graduate, college and polytechnic students.

== Board of directors ==
CASA has a board of directors that helps guide the home office staff.

This board is made up of a chair, secretary, treasurer, and four directors-at-large. The director-at-large positions include a Director of Policy, Director of Advocacy, Director of Membership, and Director of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.

<doc id="968075" wikidata="Q1758350" url="?curid=968075" title="Stunts (video game)">
<text>Stunts (also known as 4D Sports Driving) is a 3D racing video game developed by Distinctive Software and published by Broderbund in 1990. The game places emphasis on racing on stunt tracks and features a track editor. It is influenced by the arcade game &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; (1989). 

==Gameplay==

In &quot;Stunts&quot;, players race a lap around the circuit, with the aim of completing the lap as quickly as possible without crashing. These laps often feature special track areas such as loops, jumps (including over tall buildings), slalom roads and corkscrews. The square-shaped game area where the track is built is surrounded by a fence that prevents the player from leaving. Players can either race against the clock or choose between six different opponents; there is no support for real-time multiplayer. &quot;Stunts&quot; features 11 different drivable cars, with either automatic or manual transmission. Replays of races can be saved and reviewed. There are four camera views available during replay and actual driving, and the dashboard is an optional overlay on all views. It is also possible to continue the race from any point in the replay, but the time for that race will not be recorded. Another major feature of the game is the built-in track and terrain editor which allows the user to design arbitrary new tracks or modifications of existing tracks.

The cars can drive on paved roads, gravel roads, icy/snow roads, and grass if driving off the track — which all offer different levels of grip. The game has a relatively advanced pseudo-physics engine for its time which can simulate oversteer and understeer; the grip is also proportional to the banking of a curve. The game features a 3D engine with flat shading and no textures, it uses polygonal graphics for most objects, including trees and road signs, there are few sprites. The resolution is 320×200 with 256 colors. There is an option to select high and low detail. The game is written for DOS and executes in real mode.

&quot;Stunts&quot; includes a form of copy protection. Each time after running the program, players must complete a specific phrase found in the game manual before being allowed to race. If the player fails to complete the phrase three times, the next race will still load, but approximately four seconds into the race, the player is informed that they did not deactivate the car&#x27;s security system, the car crashes, and the player is returned to the main menu.

==Development==

&quot;Stunts&quot; was developed by Distinctive Software, a video game design company that was established in 1982 and based in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to the release of &quot;Stunts&quot; the company had developed other racing games such as &quot;Test Drive&quot; (1987), &quot;The Duel: Test Drive II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Grand Prix Circuit&quot; (1988).

The popularity of the arcade game &quot;Hard Drivin&#x27;&quot; (1989) from Atari Games led to new style of driving-themed games where vehicles are either greatly modified or could perform incredible stunts. This led to similarly themed games such as the arcade game &quot;Race Drivin&#x27;&quot; (1990) and personal computer (PC) games which included &quot;Stunt Driver&quot; (1990) and &quot;Stunts&quot;. Designer Kevin P. Pickell said &quot;Stunts&quot; initially began as what he described as &quot;a smash-up derby game in an arena&quot;. Progress on this format for the game was halted as cars predominantly drove backwards in demolition derbies, making it difficult to execute a 3D game where the player was primarily driving in reverse.

Don Mattrick of Distinctive Software acknowledged the influence of &quot;Hard Drivin″&quot;, saying they had and adapted what they liked from the game. Pickell echoed this, saying that he felt he could not &quot;be as good as that game&quot;, stating that arcade hardware led the market in terms of visual quality, but said that what they could do was include a track editor that would set the game apart and make it a very different experience from &quot;Hard Drivin″&quot;. The track editor in the game was initially a tool Pickell used to design the default tracks in the game. Pickell continued discussing the 3D graphics in the game, stating that texture rendering would be too slow to process at the time, which lead to making the game use a general single-colour convex polygons which would render the graphics through code run by the CPU. This was done as using a graphics card would not be a viable option during that period.

&quot;Stunts&quot; features an unrealistic game engine by design, with the idea that landing from jumps that would easily crash a real car did not sacrifice enjoyment for players. Pickell said there were many glitches in the physics engine of the game, such as being able to brake when in mid-air which were known by the developers and left in the game intentionally. Pickell responded to them saying that most of the glitches in the game were known but the team did not have time to fix them. Other known issues in the game that made it to release was the opponents controlled by the computer. Pickel said that it was difficult to have the drivers even stay on the road and it was not difficult to design a track where they would get confused on where to go. Some of the characters in the game were programmers such as Chris Taylor, who portrayed Skid Vicious.

The game features a replay mode that would showcase up to ten minutes of replay footage from a race. The code for it just saved the key or joystick inputs and compressed them to display the footage.

==Release==
&quot;Stunts&quot; was released in 1990 for PCs and was published in the United States by Broderbund. It was Distinctive Software&#x27;s first game to be published by the company. When looking for distributors in other territories, the game had to be renamed as Broderbund had the rights to the name &quot;Stunts&quot;. While promoted under the title &quot;Skid Marks&quot;, the game was eventually released as &quot;4D Sports Driving&quot; in European markets. Distinctive Software chose the latter title as they had a game titled &quot;4D Sports Boxing&quot; (1991) which they used as the basis for the &quot;4D Sports Driving&quot; title. &quot;4D Sports Driving&quot; was based on the version 1.1 of &quot;Stunts&quot;, which featured a few minor tweaks. The game was later ported to the Amiga, FM Towns and NEC PC-9801.

The Amiga version was published in 1992 by Mindscape under the name &quot;4D Sports Driving&quot; (version 1.2). SFX and music are played with samples instead of FM synthesis or PC speaker. 

The PC-9801 version was titled &quot;4D Driving&quot; (version 1.0) and was published by Electronic Arts Victor in 1993. Due to PC-9801 limitations, this version had the music synthesized and title and menu graphics changed from the previous platform&#x27;s releases, although the gameplay remained mainly the same.

FM Towns version is also named &quot;4D Driving&quot; (version 1.0) and was also published by Electronic Arts Victor in 1993. Due to FM Towns capacities, music has been changed and improved, and new songs added. Title page and menu graphics are also modified, close to PC-9801 version but with better graphics. In FM Towns version, the opponent&#x27;s photos has been changed, and Bernie Rubber character is replaced by Masahiko, a Japanese guy. His dedicated track remains the same as Bernie&#x27;s track.

While working on a library for the Sega Genesis system, Pickell applied the library to convert &quot;Stunts&quot; to work on the video game console. He said there was no plans to actually publish the game for the system and that he would want to make the frame rate better if they were ever planning to publish it.

==Reception==
Duncan MacDonald of &quot;Zero&quot; compared the game to similar racing games of the period. On reviewing &quot;4-D Sports Driving&quot; and &quot;Crash Course&quot; (1990), describing them both as video game clones of &quot;Hard Drivin″&quot;. MacDonald found the latter game to be the superior of the two titles as stating that &quot;4-D Sports Driving&quot; was a strong title only let down by &quot;jerky graphics&quot;. Ultimately, MacDonald found the game superior to &quot;Hard Drivin″&quot;, but inferior to &quot;Indianapolis 500: The Simulation&quot; (1989). Reviewing the game for the Amiga, a reviewer in &quot;Games-X&quot; complimented the games sound and suggested players to use the keyboard to control as the mouse and joystick were very unsensitive. The reviewer praised the track editor as a highlight, commenting that &quot;without it the lasting appeal would be very thin on the ground.&quot;

Michael Himowitz of the &quot;Baltimore Evening Sun&quot; included both &quot;Stunts&quot; and &quot;Stunt Driver&quot; (1990) on his list of the best games of the year, finding them both to be similar games with high quality sound, 3D graphics, and &quot;spectacular crashes.&quot; In 1994, &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Stunts&quot; the 22nd best computer game ever. The editors wrote that the sense of speed, and the degree of control the players have over their vehicle, make this a must for &quot;every&quot; gamer.
From retrospective reviews, Chris Couper of the website AllGame complimented the game for its general gameplay, the ability to create your own courses and the replay function which he described as &quot;a truly innovative touch.&quot; He suggested the game was most fun when not playing the game as dictated. He found the most fun was had attempting to exploit the glitches in the game, such as when a car would shoot directly into the sky after crashing which led to &quot;Many hours spent with friends seeing who could launch a car the furthest.&quot; In article published in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; magazine in 2008, Tim Henderson gave an overview of &quot;Stunts&quot; saying that while its graphics had quickly dated due to a lack of texture mapping, the game remained &quot;incredible fun to actually play.&quot; He highlighted the track editor in &quot;Stunts&quot; as what gave the game its lasting appeal and giving it &quot;a surprising amount of long-term robustness&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Stunts&quot; continued to have a player base decades after the games release. A fan community surrounding the game involving racing and recording replays to compete with other players and show off their skills. As &quot;Stunts&quot; allows players to rewind their gameplay during a lap via the instant replay option, it allowed players dexterity to try and find the best routes. In the mid-2000s, the game grew popular enough to have a yearly World Stunts Meeting where players would get together in person to throw parties and play live races.

<text>In the Book of Mormon, the waters of Mormon is a body of water where about two hundred Nephites are baptized.

==Summary==

In , Nephites living in King Noah&#x27;s territory who want to listen to Alma&#x27;s secret preaching gather to a place called the waters of Mormon. In the process of this preaching, Alma proceeds to invite the listeners to be baptized. Two hundred and four people are baptized, and Alma establishes a church.

Later in the Book of Mormon, , Alma&#x27;s son, also named Alma, gives a sermon in which he recapitulates the history of the Nephite church and tells his audience the baptisms in the waters of Mormon.

<text>A baseball field, also called a ball field or baseball diamond, is the field upon which the game of baseball is played. The term can also be used as a metonym for a baseball park. The term sandlot is sometimes used, although this usually refers to less organized venues for activities like sandlot ball.

==Specifications==
:&quot;Unless otherwise noted, the specifications discussed in this section refer to those described within the Baseball Rules, under which Major League Baseball is played.&quot;

The starting point for much of the action on the field is home plate (officially &quot;home base&quot;), a five-sided slab of white rubber. One side is long, the two adjacent sides are . The remaining two sides are approximately and set at a right angle. The plate is set into the ground so that its surface is level with the field. The corner of home plate where the two 11-inch sides meet at a right angle is at one corner of a square. The dimensional specifications are technically inconsistent because the angle constraints require that the front be  times the length of the back, which is not equal to a 17:12 ratio, but a physically built home plate will have side lengths accurate to a few hundredths of an inch. The other three corners of the square, in counterclockwise order from home plate, are called first, second, and third base. These bases are marked by canvas or rubber cushions, square and thick. Adjacent to each of the two parallel 8.5-inch sides is a batter&#x27;s box.

All the bases, including home plate, lie entirely within fair territory. Thus, any batted ball that touches those bases must necessarily be ruled a fair ball. While the first and third base bags are placed so that they lie inside the 90-foot square formed by the bases, the second base bag is placed so that its center (unlike first, third and home) coincides exactly with the &quot;point&quot; of the ninety-foot square. Thus, although the &quot;points&quot; of the bases are 90 feet apart, the physical distance between each successive pair of base markers is closer to .

Near the center of the square is an artificial hill known as the pitcher&#x27;s mound, atop which is a white rubber slab known as the pitcher&#x27;s plate, colloquially the &quot;rubber&quot;. The specifications for the pitcher&#x27;s mound are described below.

The lines from home plate to first and third bases extend to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction and are called the foul lines. The portion of the playing field between (and including) the foul lines is fair territory; the rest is &quot;foul territory&quot;. The area within the square formed by the bases is officially called the infield, though colloquially this term also includes fair territory in the vicinity of the square; fair territory outside the infield is known as the outfield. Most baseball fields are enclosed with a fence that marks the outer edge of the outfield. The fence is usually set at a distance ranging from from home plate. Most professional and college baseball fields have a right and left foul pole which are about apart. These poles are at the intersection of the foul lines and the respective ends of the outfield fence and, unless otherwise specified within the ground rules, lie in fair territory. Thus, a batted ball that passes over the outfield wall in flight and touches the foul pole is a fair ball and the batter is awarded a home run.

==Infield==
A baseball infield is the square area within the four 90-foot baselines (60-foot baselines in Little League Baseball for youths 12 years old and under). The four bases are integral parts of the infield; a ball that touches any part of a base is considered a fair ball.

===Bases===
====First base====
First base is the first of the four bases that must be touched by a runner in order to score a run for the batting team. The runner may continue running past first base in a straight line without being in jeopardy of being put out, so long as they make contact with first base and make no move or attempt to advance to second base.

The first baseman is the defensive player mainly responsible for the area near first base. A first baseman is often tall. A tall first baseman has a larger range for reaching and catching errant throws.

In some youth leagues and adult recreational leagues, a &quot;double first base&quot; or &quot;safety first base&quot; is used. A double first base is rectangular (rather than square), measuring 30 by 15 inches. It is normally colored white and orange (two 15 by 15 inches squares). It is placed with the white half in fair territory and the orange half in foul territory. The white half is used by the first baseman to make plays while the orange half is used by the runner. This creates a separation between the first baseman and runner, reducing the chance of injury on plays at first base.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the first baseman is assigned the number 3.

====Second base====
Second base is the second of the four bases a runner must touch in order to score a run. Second base is mainly defended by the second baseman and the shortstop. The second baseman and shortstop ideally possess quick feet and the ability to release the ball rapidly and accurately. One player will usually cover second base while the other attempts to field the ball. Both players must communicate well to be able to make a double play. Particular agility is required of the second baseman in double play situations, which usually force the player to throw towards first base while their momentum carries them in the opposite direction.

A runner on second base is said to be in &quot;scoring position&quot;, since there is a higher likelihood of scoring a run from second base on a single. Since second base is the farthest from home plate, it is the most commonly stolen base in baseball.

In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the second baseman is assigned the number 4, and the shortstop 6.

====Third base====

Third base is the third of the four bases a runner must touch in order to score a run. The third baseman is the defensive player mainly responsible for the area nearest third base. A third baseman ideally possesses quick reaction to batted balls and a strong arm to make the long throw to first base. Third base is sometimes referred to as the &quot;hot corner&quot; as it&#x27;s common for right-handed batters to hit the ball hardly to third base, making successfully fielding the ball difficult and possibly dangerous. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number 5.

Like a runner on second base, a runner on third base is said to be in &quot;scoring position&quot;, since there is a higher likelihood of scoring a run on a single or sacrifice fly provided that the third and final out is not recorded before they can reach home plate.

==== Home base ====
Home base, usually called &quot;home plate&quot;, is the final base that a player must touch to score a run. Unlike the other bases, home plate is a five-sided slab of white rubber that is set at ground level.

===Backstop===
In most MLB stadiums, the backstop is at least 60 feet behind home plate and is composed of a lower solid wall and upper netting that protects spectators behind home plate from wild pitches, passed balls, and foul balls.

In recreational fields, there is usually a tall chain-link fence that surrounds the infield and the players&#x27; bench for player safety.

=== Baselines ===
Baselines are straight lines between two adjacent bases normally made of chalk. Physical baselines are not drawn between first and second or second and third bases; the foul lines serve to mark the baseline between home plate and first base, and between third base and home.

==== Running baseline ====
Generally, baserunners are not required to follow the baseline. A baserunner seeking to advance more than one base typically &quot;rounds&quot; the base, following a more circular path. However, a runner&#x27;s left-right motion is constrained when the defense tries to tag him. At the moment the defense begins the attempt, the baserunner&#x27;s running baseline is established as a direct line from his current position to the base he is trying for. A runner straying more than away from this baseline to avoid a tag may be called out.

==== Running lane ====
Beginning halfway between home and first base, and ending at first base, there is a second chalk line to the right of the foul line. This second line and the part of the foul line it runs parallel to, form the running lane that defines the path in which a batter-runner must run as he is advancing to first base. Rule 6.05(k) of the Official Baseball Rules states that if a batter-runner running to first base runs outside the running lane, and &quot;in doing so&quot; interferes with the fielder taking the throw at first, then the batter-runner is automatically out. First base itself is not located in the running lane, but Rule 6.05 lets the batter-runner leave the running lane &quot;by means of a step, stride or slide in the immediate vicinity of first base&quot; to step on first base.

===Playing areas near home plate===
====Batter&#x27;s box====
The batter&#x27;s box is the place where the batter stands when ready to receive a pitch from the pitcher. It is usually drawn in chalk on the dirt surrounding home plate, and the insides of the boxes are watered down before each game.

The chalk lines delineating the two foul lines are rarely extended through the batter&#x27;s boxes. However, those lines exist conceptually for the purpose of judging a batted ball fair or foul. In addition, inside edges of the batter&#x27;s boxes are often not laid-in with chalk. Similarly, though not marked, those lines continue to exist for the purpose of the rules pertaining to the batter&#x27;s box and the batter&#x27;s position relative thereto.

There are two batter&#x27;s boxes, one on each side of home plate. The batter&#x27;s boxes are wide and long. The batter&#x27;s boxes are centered lengthwise at the center of home plate with the inside line of each batter&#x27;s box from the near edge of home plate. A right-handed batter would stand in the batter&#x27;s box on the right side of home plate from the perspective of the pitcher. A left-handed batter would stand in the batter&#x27;s box to their left. A batter may only occupy one batter&#x27;s box at a time and may not legally leave the batter&#x27;s box after the pitcher has come set or has started their windup. Should the batter wish to leave the batter&#x27;s box once the pitcher has engaged the rubber, they must first ask the umpire for time-out. Time will not be granted if the pitcher has already started their pitching motion. For playing rules relating to the batter&#x27;s box, see Rules 6.05 and 6.06 of the Official Baseball Rules.

====Catcher&#x27;s box====
The catcher&#x27;s box is an area of the field behind home plate which the catcher occupies to avoid committing a balk when a pitch is thrown.

====Pitcher&#x27;s mound====

In roughly the middle of the square, equidistant between first and third base, and a few feet closer to home plate than to second base, is a low artificial hill called the pitcher&#x27;s mound. This is where the pitcher stands when throwing the pitch. Atop the mound is a white rubber slab, called the pitcher&#x27;s plate or pitcher&#x27;s rubber. It measures front-to-back and across, the front of which is exactly from the rear point of home plate. This peculiar distance was set by the rule makers in 1893, not due to a clerical or surveying error as popular myth has it, but intentionally (further details under &quot;History&quot;).

In Major League Baseball, a regulation mound is in diameter, with the center from the rear point of home plate, on the line between home plate and second base. The front edge of the &quot;pitcher&#x27;s plate&quot; or &quot;rubber&quot; is behind the center of the mound, making the front edge&#x27;s midpoint 60 feet 6 inches from the rear point of home plate. Six inches (15 cm) in front of the pitcher&#x27;s rubber the mound begins to slope downward. The top of the rubber is to be no higher than ten inches (25 cm) above home plate. From 1903 through 1968, this height limit was set at , but in reality differed from ballpark to ballpark as the height was considered too difficult to enforce.

A higher mound generally favors the pitcher and teams which emphasized pitching, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers, would have a slightly higher mound. With the height advantage, the pitcher gains more leverage and can put more downward velocity on the ball, making it more difficult for the batter to strike the ball squarely with the bat. After 1968, known among baseball historians as &quot;the year of the pitcher&quot;, the official height of the mound was lowered from to in an attempt to &quot;increase the batting&quot; once again.

A pitcher&#x27;s mound is difficult for groundskeepers to maintain. Usually before every game it is watered down to keep the dust from spreading. On youth and amateur baseball fields, the mound may be much different from the rule book definition due to erosion and repair attempts. Even in the major leagues, each mound gains its own character, as pitchers are allowed to kick away pieces of dirt in their way, thereby sculpting the mound a bit to their preference.

The pitcher may keep a rosin bag on the rear of the mound to dry off their hands. Major League Baseball teams are also permitted cleat cleaners on the back of the mound. This may be a flat grate-style plate, or simply a hand tool such as a piece of wood used to remove mud and dirt from cleats. These items are allowed to remain on the backside of the mound at the discretion of the umpire, thus reducing the probability that they will affect a live play.

==Grass line==
 The grass line, where the dirt of the infield ends and the grass of the outfield begins, has no special significance to the rules of the game (except in Double-A Minor League Baseball where all infielders must be on the infield dirt when the pitch is thrown as part of an experimental rule for the 2021 season), but it can influence the outcome of a game. Dirt running paths between the bases (and, at one time and still in some parks, between the pitcher and the catcher) have existed since the beginning of the game, although they were not mentioned in the rule books until around 1950, and their specifications are flexible. In addition to providing a running path, the grass lines act as a visual aid so that players, umpires and fans may better judge distance from the center of the diamond. Occasionally the ball may take a tricky bounce off the dirt area or the edge between the dirt and the grass. Multiple World Series championships (including 1924, 1960 and 1986) have been decided or heavily influenced by erratic hops of ground balls.

In artificial turf stadiums, infield dirt was originally only placed in three five-sided areas around the bases and in two circles around the pitcher&#x27;s and batting areas, which are referred to as &quot;cut outs&quot;. In this configuration, the &quot;grass line&quot; is usually designated with a white arc. This setup first appeared at Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium upon its opening in 1970. Among Major League Baseball fields, Rogers Centre was the last stadium to maintain this type of configuration and was reconfigured with a full dirt infield starting in the 2016 MLB season.

In some college baseball parks with artificial turf fields, the entire field (along with possibly the pitcher&#x27;s mound) is made up of turf, with parts of the field mainly containing dirt instead merely being clay-colored turf.

==Outfield==

The outfield is made from thick grass or artificial turf. It is where the outfielders play. The positions to play in the outfield are left, center, and right field (named in relation to the batter&#x27;s position; thus left field is beyond third base and right field is beyond first base). Outfields vary in size and shape depending on the overall size and shape of the playing field. The outfield stretches from the infield to the outfield wall and it contains the warning track. Outfields especially vary from Little League to major league fields. Little League outfields vary more in size than Major League outfields. Outfields often differ from infields in the specific type of grass used, but most major league outfields are grass.

===Warning track===
The warning track is the strip of dirt at the edges of the baseball field (especially in front of the home run fence and along the left and right sides of a field). Because the warning track&#x27;s color and feel differ from the grass field, a fielder can remain focused on a fly ball near the fence and measure their proximity to the fence while attempting to catch the ball safely.

A warning track&#x27;s width is not specified in the rules. It is generally designed to give about three steps of warning to the highest-level players using the field. Typical widths run from about six feet for Little League fields to about for college- or professional-level play. A warning track this wide also lets groundskeepers avoid driving maintenance vehicles on the grass.

The track can be composed of finely ground rock particles such as cinders, which is why announcer Bob Wolff called it the &quot;cinder path&quot; rather than the &quot;warning track&quot;.

The idea of a warning track originated in Yankee Stadium, where an actual running track was built for use in track and field events. When ballpark designers saw how the track helped fielders, it soon became a feature of every ballpark.

Single-minded fielders often crash into a wall trying to make a catch despite the warning track. For this reason, outfield walls are typically padded for extra safety. Wrigley Field&#x27;s brick wall is covered only by ivy, which is not especially soft. However, there are pads on the walls of the tight left and right field corners in foul ground.

&quot;Warning-track power&quot; is a derogatory term for a batter who seems to have just enough power to hit the ball to the warning track for an out, but not enough to hit a home run. The term more generally refers to someone or something that is almost but not quite good enough for something.

===Outfield wall===
The outfield wall or fence is the outer boundary of the outfield. A ball passing over the wall is dead. If it passes over the wall in fair territory, without touching the ground, it is a home run. The official rules do not specify the shape, height, or composition of the wall, or a specific mandatory distance from home plate (though Major League Baseball mandates a minimum distance of and recommends a minimum distance of at the foul poles and at center field). As a result, baseball fields can vary greatly along those lines. The wall has numbers affixed or painted on it that denote the distance from that point on the wall to home plate. In most modern major league ballparks, the wall is made of some hard material (e.g., concrete, plywood, sheet metal) with padding on the field side to protect players who may collide with the wall at high speed while trying to make a play. Chain link fencing may also be incorporated into the wall in areas where the wall needs to be transparent, e.g., an outfield bullpen, a spectator area behind the wall, or to protect a scoreboard incorporated into the wall. Many ballparks feature a yellow line denoting the top of the wall to aid umpires in judging whether the ball passed over the wall or if the ball is fair or foul.

====Foul poles====

Foul poles, if present, help umpires judge whether a fly ball hit above the fence line is foul (out of play) or fair (a home run). The poles are a vertical extension of the foul lines at the edge of the field of play. The outer edge of the foul lines and foul poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to American football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds. The minimum distance to hit a home run (along either foul line) is set by baseball rules, generally at .

Before 1931 (with the exception of a couple months in 1920) the foul lines extended indefinitely; a batter was awarded a home run only if a fly ball out of the field was fair where it landed. Now, a batted ball that leaves the field in flight is judged fair or foul at the point it leaves the field. Thus, such a fly ball passing on the fair side of a foul pole, or hitting a foul pole, is a home run regardless of where the ball goes thereafter.

Foul poles are typically much higher than the top of the outfield fence or wall, and often have a narrow screen running along the fair side of the pole. This further aids the umpires&#x27; judgment, as a ball that bounces off this screen is a home run. It can still be a difficult call, especially in ballparks with no outfield stands behind the poles to provide perspective. Wrigley Field is notorious for arguments over long, curving flies down a foul line (most notably in left field) that sail higher than the foul pole.

At Major League Baseball fields, foul poles are usually yellow. Those at Citi Field are orange. At Petco Park, there is no foul pole in left field; the pole&#x27;s function is served by a yellow metal strip along the corner of the Western Metal Supply Co. building. Several parks featuring advertising along the length of the foul pole, with the most prominent example being the advertising from Chick-fil-A at both Citi Field and Daikin Park (serving as a pun, with &quot;fowl&quot; being another term for a chicken, the primary meat featured by that restaurant chain).

==Player preparation and coaching areas==
===Bullpen===
The bullpen (sometimes referred to as simply &quot;the &#x27;pen&quot;) is the area where pitchers warm up before entering a game. Depending on the ballpark, it may be situated in foul territory along the baselines or just beyond the outfield fence. Relief pitchers usually wait in the bullpen when they have yet to play in a game, rather than in the dugout with the rest of the team. The starting pitcher also makes their final pregame warmups in the bullpen. Managers can call coaches in the bullpen on an in-house telephone from the dugout to tell a certain pitcher to begin their warmup tosses.
&quot;Bullpen&quot; is also used metonymically to describe a team&#x27;s collection of relief pitchers.

===On-deck circles===

There are two on-deck circles in the field, one for each team, positioned in foul ground between home plate and the respective teams&#x27; benches. The on-deck circle is where the next scheduled batter, or &quot;on-deck&quot; batter, warms up while waiting for the current batter to finish their turn. The on-deck circle is either an area composed of bare dirt; a plain circle painted onto artificial turf; or often, especially at the professional level, a mat made from artificial material, with the team or league logo painted onto it.

===Coach&#x27;s boxes===
The coach&#x27;s boxes, located behind first and third base, are where the first and third base coaches are supposed to stand, although coaches often stand outside the box. This is permissible as long as the coach does not interfere with play and the opposing team does not object (in which case the umpire shall ensure that all coaches on both teams must abide by the boundaries of the coach&#x27;s boxes). The coach&#x27;s boxes are marked with chalk or paint. In the early days of baseball, the term &quot;coacher&#x27;s box&quot; was used, as &quot;coach&quot; was taken to be a verb. As the term &quot;coach&quot; evolved into a noun, the name of the box also changed.

==History==
=== Knickerbocker Rules ===
The basic layout of the field has been little changed since the Knickerbocker Rules of the 1840s. Those rules specified the distance from home to second as 42 &quot;paces&quot;. The dictionary definition of a &quot;pace&quot; at the time was 30 inches, yielding base paths of approximately 75 feet; however, if a &quot;pace&quot; of three feet was meant then the distance would have been 89 feet. It is not implausible that the early clubs simply stepped off the distance. 30 yards (90 feet) between the bases was first explicitly prescribed by the NABBP Convention of 1857. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense.

The original Knickerbocker Rules did not specify the pitching distance explicitly; the 1854 Unified Rules stated &quot;from Home to pitcher not less than fifteen paces&quot;. By the time major league baseball began in the 1870s, the pitcher was compelled to pitch from within a &quot;box&quot; whose front edge was from the &quot;point&quot; of home plate. Although they had to release the ball before crossing the line, as with bowlers in cricket, they also had to start their delivery from within the box, meaning that they could only run for a short distance before throwing; they could not run in from the field as bowlers do. Furthermore, the pitcher had to throw underhand. By the 1880s, pitchers had mastered the underhand delivery—in fact, in 1880, there were two perfect games within a week of each other.

=== Modern history ===
In an attempt to &quot;increase the batting&quot;, the front edge of the pitcher&#x27;s box was moved back 5 feet in 1881, to from home plate. The size of the box was altered over the following few years. Pitchers were allowed to throw overhand starting in 1884, and that tilted the balance of power again. In 1887, the box was set at wide and deep, with the front edge still 50 feet from the plate. However, the pitcher was compelled to deliver the ball with their back foot at the line of the box, thus somewhat restricting their ability to &quot;power&quot; the ball with their overhand delivery.

In 1893, the box was replaced by the pitcher&#x27;s plate, although &quot;the box&quot; is still used today as a slang term for the pitcher&#x27;s location on the field. Exactly 5 feet was added to the point the pitcher had to toe, again &quot;to increase the batting&quot; (and hopefully to increase attendance, as fan interest had flagged somewhat), resulting in the seemingly peculiar pitching distance of .

Some sources suggest that the pitching distance evolved from 45 to 50 to 60.5 feet. However, the first two were the &quot;release point&quot; and the third is the &quot;pushoff point.&quot; The 1893 rule change added only 5 feet to the release point, not 10.5 feet.

Originally the pitcher threw from flat ground. Gradually, the raised mound was developed, somewhat returning the advantage to the pitchers. From 1893 to 1950, a stipulation was added that the mound be no more than 15 inches above the field. Before the mid-20th century, it was common for baseball fields to include a dirt pathway between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and home plate. This feature is sometimes known as the &quot;keyhole&quot; due to the shape that it makes together with the mound. The keyhole was once as wide as the pitcher&#x27;s box and resembled a cricket pitch. Sometimes this path extended through the batting area and all the way to the backstop. Once the rounded pitcher&#x27;s mound was developed, the path became more ornamental than practical, and was gradually thinned before being largely abandoned by the 1950s. In recent years some ballparks, such as Comerica Park and Chase Field in the major leagues, have revived the feature for nostalgic reasons.

From 1857 to 1867 home plate was a circular iron plate, painted or enameled white, covering &quot;a space equal to one square foot of surface&quot;, i.e. with a diameter of ~13-1/2 inches. In 1868 the plate was changed to a square, 12&quot; on a side, originally set with the flat sides toward the pitcher and catcher; the new professional National Association rotated it 45 degrees in 1871. In 1872 the rules required it to be made of white marble or stone set flush with the ground. For the rest of the century materials varied between stone, iron and wood, but at all times it was a white twelve-inch square. The pentagonal shape and the mandatory use of rubber were developed by Robert Keating, who had pitched one game for the 1887 Baltimore Orioles; the new plate was adopted by the National League in 1900. From 1861 to 1874 the center, not the back, of the plate was situated on the intersection of the foul lines, and in 1875–76 was moved entirely into foul ground with the &quot;pitcher&#x27;s point&quot; at the intersection. In 1877 it was moved forward to its modern location, wholly in fair territory.

There were no batters&#x27; boxes before 1874. Up until that time, the batter was required to hit with their front foot on a line passing through the center of the plate. The 1874 batters&#x27; boxes were 6 feet by 3 feet, 12 inches from the plate; the modern dimensions (6&#x27; x 4&#x27;) were instituted in 1885 by the National League and the following year by the American Association

<text>Martin Walkyier (born 20 September 1967) is an English singer known for his involvement in the heavy metal bands Sabbat and Skyclad.

== Biography ==
Walkyier was born on 20 September 1967 as the only child of Roy and Eve Walkyier. At the age of eight, he developed an interest in acting and poetry and began to play guitar. Inspired by bands like Witchfynde, he formed Hydra and later Sabbat with Fraser Craske.

Walkyier quit his job as a truck driver to dedicate more time to his music, despite the lack of a secure income. He left Sabbat in 1990 and returned to the music scene with Skyclad, a band that blended heavy metal with folk music and helped pioneer folk metal.

After the release of ten albums, Walkyier found himself financially strained. He later remarked, &quot;The insight that you can&#x27;t live on dreaming came too late. Unfair contracts, incompetent advisers, poor decisions, and my naivety nearly broke me. I felt like I was in a marriage, not divorced because of the children.&quot;

Following his departure from Skyclad, Walkyier took a job as a nightwatchman for a furniture store. He performed occasional concerts under the name Return to the Sabbat and started a company called Prick Tees, which designed and produced T-shirts.

Walkyier assisted bassist Iscariah when he relocated to England with his family. He arranged an apartment for Iscariah and secured a job for his wife. It took two years to organise everything before they could focus on Walkyier&#x27;s new band: The Clan Destined.

During this time, Walkyier had to care for his frail mother and ill father while The Clan Destined faded into the background. According to Walkyier, Iscariah left without explaining his reasons and abandoned him. Nevertheless, he completed &quot;In the Big Ending&quot; but was disillusioned and announced it would be his last musical project. However, he promised his father on his deathbed that he would continue. (Roy Walkyier died in early 2007).

Martin Walkyier structured and arranged the music previously composed by Iscariah. The resulting album featured a DVD with a video for the song &quot;A Beautiful Start to the End of the World,&quot; inspired by the novel &quot;Aimée und Jaguar&quot;. According to &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; journalist Detlef Dengler, the video &quot;is professional and looks very expensive&quot;; however, Walkyier noted that &quot;it cost almost nothing.&quot; He continued, &quot;The Clan Destined consists of Pagans with a common life philosophy as artists, designers, and filmmakers.&quot;

Sabbat reformed in 2006 to play a series of well-received shows.

In late 2008, Walkyier completed the recordings for The Clan Destined&#x27;s debut album and recorded vocals for Hell&#x27;s debut album. &quot;Hell and especially their singer Dave Halliday were my idols in the early 1980s. My friends all listened to Metallica, but I was drawn to bands with image and true personality. The theatrics of bands like Hell influenced me tremendously.&quot;

With Walkyier&#x27;s friend Andy Sneap, also &quot;a fanatic Hell supporter,&quot; they approached the remaining three members after Halliday&#x27;s suicide and offered to help them as singer and guitarist, modernising the old songs.

Walkyier also provided guest vocals for Cradle of Filth and Forgodsake.

In 2008 and 2009, Walkyier announced he was working on a rock opera. The story, entitled &quot;Plugging Hellfire&quot;, was published in &quot;Devolution&quot; magazine and illustrated by Neil Sims, with a biography contributed by Paul Stenning.

In October 2009, Walkyier announced that he was writing and recording new material for The Clan Destined.

== Reception ==
The late &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; journalist Detlef Dengler described Walkyier as a &quot;great lyricist&quot; noted for his extensive vocabulary and &quot;brilliant puns&quot;. Author Paul Stenning has referred to Walkyier as a &quot;lyrical genius&quot;.

<doc id="968111" wikidata="Q5261794" url="?curid=968111" title="Derek Beackon">
<text>Derek William Beackon (born 1946 in Stepney) is a British far-right politician. He is currently a member of the British Democratic Party (BDP), and a former member of the British National Party (BNP) and National Front. In 1993, he became the BNP&#x27;s first elected councillor, although he served for only eight months.

==Beackon and the emergence of the BNP==

Beackon joined the BNP in 1986 as an associate member, and became a full member two years later. Known as &#x27;Daddy&#x27;, Beackon first stood as a candidate for the BNP in 1990 in the Redcoat ward of London Borough of Tower Hamlets where he gained 3% of the vote, a typically low total for the party at the time.

Although Beackon&#x27;s personal result had been a disappointment in Tower Hamlets, the area had slowly been growing as a centre of support for the BNP. The BNP still lagged behind the National Front (NF) in terms of public profile (even though that movement had fallen into severe decline). The BNP had respectable results in the area in a series of council by-elections in 1990. The area had also been one of the centres of support for John Tyndall during the 1992 general election; Tyndall had stood in Bow and Poplar, which included much of Tower Hamlets.

Under the directorship of local organizer Eddy Butler, the party had instigated a &#x27;Rights for Whites&#x27; campaign in the area, bringing back a slogan that had been employed by Martin Webster and the NF during the 1970s. Focusing on the perceived negative impact of immigration on the area of employment and housing, the campaign operated as if it was simply a local pressure group before gradually introducing the BNP name into Rights for Whites literature.

The initiative first produced results in the Millwall ward in October 1992 when a strong canvassing effort by local activists helped BNP candidate Barry Osborne capture 20% of the vote in a by-election. Millwall had long been a seat of unemployment associated with the declining docklands area. Most of the population had been descended from the 19th century workers who had built and operated the docks. With the building of the Limehouse Link Road, predominantly Bangladeshi families from a run-down Council estate in Limehouse (the St Vincent Estate) were rehoused in properties in Millwall. These properties had been marketed as &#x27;luxury&#x27;, but had failed to sell after a downturn in the property market. This was presented as favourable treatment on grounds of race by the &quot;Liberal Democrat Focus Team&quot; seeking to capitalise on the issue. However, in a close three-way contest, the BNP gained from this campaign more than its authors.

A Labour councillor resigned in the same ward soon after this, sparking another by-election on 16 September 1993. Beackon was chosen as the candidate this time, following the local party&#x27;s policy of rotating members. Beackon&#x27;s campaign followed Butler&#x27;s blueprint of emphasising &#x27;Rights for Whites&#x27; through canvassing and leafleting. He abandoned the old policy of holding a public meeting as he felt they proved too counterproductive by attracting large crowds of protesters, particularly from the Anti-Nazi League and Anti-Fascist Action. Beackon won the by-election of 16 September 1993 with 1480 votes (33.9%), beating Labour by 7 votes, with an overall turnout of 44%. He thus became the first elected representative for the party.

===Reaction to Beackon&#x27;s win===
The immediate reaction to Beackon&#x27;s election was widespread condemnation from many sections of wider society. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; headline on 18 September read &quot;SIEG HEIL...and Now He&#x27;s a British Councillor&quot;, setting the tone for a slew of condemnation on the basis of Beackon being a white nationalist. Among those to express their outrage were the main political parties, the Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Condon. Beackon&#x27;s own use of immoderate language also damaged him and he was quoted in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; when, after being asked about refuse collection, he said that &quot;The Asians are rubbish and that is what we are going to clear from the streets.&quot;

==Beackon as a councillor==
As a councillor, Beackon found it hard to discharge his duties effectively because of a boycott by other councillors and staff, who staged a protest walk-out after his election. He was hampered by his own inexperience: the BNP press office had to speak for him after he failed to distinguish between the housing and social service departments in a newspaper interview with the &quot;East London Advertiser&quot;. He had to flee his flat in Wapping to live in hiding with his brother in Bethnal Green during which time his housing benefit was cancelled.

Beackon was unable to fulfill his promises to influence housing allocation to benefit white constituents. Overall, during his time in office Beackon was characterized as a weak councillor who had trouble following the council agenda. At the time it was suggested that Beackon was virtually illiterate and was unable to read council documents; he later strenuously denied the allegations while admitting that he had trouble understanding their meaning.

When the seat went up for election again in 1994 a strong mobilization of voters against the BNP was undertaken by Labour, with the turnout rising to 65%. Despite Beackon&#x27;s generally ineffectual performance as a councillor he added 561 votes to his total, although the seat was lost as the rest of the vote largely coalesced around Labour, and the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed. He was the only successful BNP candidate during John Tyndall&#x27;s tenure as party leader. The BNP did not win any more council seats until they won three seats in Burnley in 2002.

==Chief steward==
Before and during his run as a Tower Hamlets councillor, Beackon served as the BNP&#x27;s chief steward, which included the job of ensuring order at BNP meetings. As chief steward he was given the job of leading the party&#x27;s bodyguard group set up in 1992. Made up largely of casuals and white power skinheads, the group soon proved difficult for the middle-aged Beackon to control, and before long, real control lay with Charlie Sargent and his brother Steve. Following Beackon&#x27;s election, the group became disillusioned with the electoral path and broke away from the BNP, adopting the name Combat 18. Eddy Butler and Tony Lecomber were among the BNP members targeted for attack, in what became a bitter split.

==Later BNP activism==
Beackon&#x27;s profile fell away somewhat after his election defeat as the BNP failed to capitalise on their breakthrough. He remained loyal to Butler, who had fallen out of favour with Tyndall, and was interviewed for the first issue of &quot;The Patriot&quot;, a dissident journal within the party associated with Butler, Lecomber, Michael Newland, and others on the party&#x27;s &#x27;modernising&#x27; wing, all of whom went on to back Nick Griffin in his successful challenge to Tyndall&#x27;s leadership. Indeed, Beackon appeared in &quot;Moving On, Moving Up&quot;, a glossy brochure produced by Griffin during his leadership campaign, endorsing the former Political Soldier for the BNP leadership.

Despite this support Beackon remained a peripheral figure within the BNP under Griffin&#x27;s leadership and before long he fell in with the group of anti-Griffin activists around Tyndall. His eulogy to Tyndall was one of the few written by an active BNP member to appear in the final issue of &quot;Spearhead&quot;, released immediately following Tyndall&#x27;s death. Still nominally a member of the BNP he has become associated with the &#x27;Friends of John Tyndall&#x27;, an informal anti-Griffin group largely controlled by Richard Edmonds and John Morse in attending a speech by Valerie Tyndall which they had organised in July 2007. The event included stalls by a number of political parties – the National Front, England First Party and the British People&#x27;s Party. The BNP did not participate.

Beackon re-emerged as a BNP activist in Thurrock, Essex. He was a BNP candidate for the Orsett ward of Thurrock Council in May 2008. This is a safe Conservative ward and Beackon finished in third place with 330 votes, 17.8% of the total.

For the 2010 council elections, he stood for the Chadwell St Mary ward and gained 811 votes (19.8%).

==Post-BNP years==
By 2012, Beackon had left the BNP and joined the National Front, standing as a candidate in the Chadwell St Mary ward for the local elections in Thurrock and gained 103 votes (6.1%) in fourth place out of five candidates by beating the Liberal Democrat.

In 2022, alongside several other prominent far-right activists and politicians, Beackon joined the British Democratic Party (BDP). It was founded in 2013 by then-MEP Andrew Brons, who had narrowly failed to oust Griffin in the 2011 BNP leadership election.

<doc id="968113" wikidata="Q1635180" url="?curid=968113" title="Swedish Rite">
<text>The Swedish Rite is a variation or Rite of Freemasonry that is common in Scandinavian countries and to a limited extent in Germany. It is different from other branches of Freemasonry in that, rather than having the three self-contained foundation degrees and seemingly-endless side degrees and appendant bodies, it has an integrated system with ten degrees. It is also different in that, rather than moving through the offices or &#x27;chairs&#x27;, progress in the Swedish Rite is based on moving through the ten degrees. A fundamental difference is the Swedish Rite&#x27;s position on religious affiliation: Anglo/American &#x27;Regular&#x27; Masonry requires a belief in any theistic religion and Continental &#x27;Liberal&#x27; Masonry does not require belief in any religion, whereas Swedish Masonry is specifically Christian, and requires a Christian trinitarian belief in all its members. Nonetheless, the main Swedish Rite constitutions are all recognised as regular by the United Grand Lodge of England, and stand in full amity.

The Swedish Rite is the default and customary Masonic rite in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. In Finland there exists an agreement of shared jurisdiction between the native Grand Lodge of Finland, working standard Anglo-American tradition Masonry, and a Provincial Grand Lodge of the Swedish Rite Swedish Order of Freemasons. A variant form of the Swedish Rite is worked in Germany by the Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany, where it is one of five different Masonic systems that co-exist within the umbrella group the United Grand Lodges of Germany.

Although fully independent of each other, the Scandinavian Grand Lodges work closely together to ensure that their rituals are as similar as possible.

Since 7 November 2006 all laws of the Swedish Order of Freemasons are publicly available on the Internet. Among others, the laws prohibit any member to gain advantages outside the lodge by using the lodge as an instrument. The laws also stress the charity works of the members and the observance of the Golden Rule.

==Membership==

The Swedish Rite has approximately 16,500 members in the Swedish Obedience (of which 15,200 are in Sweden and 1,300 in Finland), 8,000 in Denmark, 3,500 in Iceland, and 16,700 in Norway.

Members must be at least twenty-one years of age and of good repute; they must be recommended by at least two members, one of whom must have at least the seventh degree and the other at least the third. The traditional rule that a candidate must come of his own will and accord is enforced within the Swedish Rite and solicitation of members is strictly prohibited.

A final requirement is that the candidate professes to adhere to a mainstream Christian faith. If the Christian belief of the candidate is in doubt, a birth certificate may be requested; in the Scandinavian countries, birth certificates contain a field for religion. Owing to the religious history of the Scandinavian nations, Swedish Rite Freemasonry has strong connections with the various national Lutheran churches, which are the majority churches of all the Swedish Rite nations. However, members of any Trinitarian Christian denomination are accepted into membership. Membership of certain sects which are unrecognised by the World Council of Churches does not qualify a candidate for membership of the Swedish Rite; these include the Mormons, the Unification Church (the Moonies), and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

==Degrees and Structure==
===Overview===
Swedish Rite masonry has ten degrees divided into three groups. The first two groups are called lodges, while the third is called simply Chapter. I.-III.-degree masons meet in a St. John&#x27;s lodge (equivalent to Blue Lodge or Craft Lodge). IV-V. and VI.-degree masons meet in a St. Andrew&#x27;s lodge (in some areas equivalent to the Scottish Rite) while VII.-X.-degree masons meet in their respective Chapter.

As a cherished relic from the previously practised Rite of Strict Observance, The Grand Lodge of Denmark maintains a Novice-degree in between the VII. and VIII.-degree.

All grand lodge officers have to be Knights and Commanders of the Red Cross (or simply &quot;R&amp;K&quot;), of which there are a limited number. Though not formally a degree, grand lodge officers, as a means of expressing the hierarchical nature of the order, are sometimes said to have obtained the XI.-degree. Since being a Knight and Commander of the Red Cross is linked with the duties of a grand lodge office, only a very few Swedish Rite-masons will become one.

=== Degrees ===
The Swedish Rite system is grouped into three divisions:
====St John&#x27;s (&quot;Craft&quot;) degrees==== 
*I – &quot;Apprentice&quot;
*II – &quot;Fellow Craft&quot;
*III – &quot;Master Mason&quot;

====St Andrew&#x27;s (&quot;Scottish&quot;) degrees==== 
*IV/V – &quot;Very Worshipful Apprentice and Fellow of St Andrew&quot; (a double degree)
*VI – &quot;Illustrious Scottish Master of St Andrew&quot;

====Chapter degrees====
*VII – &quot;Very Illustrious Brother, Knight of the East&quot;
*VIII – &quot;Most Illustrious Brother, Knight of the West&quot;
*IX – &quot;Enlightened Brother of St John&#x27;s Lodge &quot;
*X – &quot;Very Enlightened Brother of St Andrew&#x27;s Lodge&quot; 
Honorific chapter degree for Grand Lodge Officers and Provincial Grand Masters:
*XI – &quot;Most Enlightened Brother, Knight and Commander of the Red Cross&quot; (&quot;R&amp;K&quot;)

=== Structure ===
St. John&#x27;s, St. Andrews and Chapter work are done in different rooms or buildings. While many towns have a St. John&#x27;s (Craft) Lodge, fewer have a St. Andrews Lodge. There is only one Chapter per masonic district.

In Denmark, Norway and Germany a mason will retain his craft lodge-membership while advancing through the St. Andrew&#x27;s and Chapter degrees, and pay dues to all. In Denmark, dues are collected by the Danish Order of Freemasons and distributed to the relevant St. John&#x27;s, St. Andrews and Chapter-organisations.

In Sweden, Finland, and Iceland a mason will not retain his craft lodge-membership, when he advances to the IV–V.-degree, or his St. Andrew&#x27;s Lodge-membership, when he advances to the VII.-degree. Also, dues are paid only to the lodge of which the mason is presently a member. Because of the sometimes large distance between one&#x27;s home and the closest St. Andrew&#x27;s Lodge, travel outlays can be excessive. To remedy this, Square-and-Compasses Clubs or Friendship Clubs were created in small towns so that St. Andrew&#x27;s or Chapter Freemasons can socialise without travelling inordinate distances; in Denmark these are called Instruction Lodges. Friendship Clubs cannot confer degrees, except by dispensation from Grand Lodge.

Swedish freemasons can in rare cases be awarded with the Order of Charles XIII. This is a Royal order of chivalry, equivalent to a knighthood and given only to Knights and Commanders of the Red Cross at the King&#x27;s pleasure; its members may not number more than thirty-three, and three of them must be ecclesiastics of the established Lutheran Church. Although it is jokingly termed the &#x27;twelfth degree&#x27;, the Order of Charles XIII is in no way a part of the official Swedish Rite, and is not classed as a masonic degree.

The Masonic ring is given in the eighth degree, and consists of the customary red St. Georges&#x27;s Cross and has the Masonic initials I.D.S which stands for In Dominus Spees. It is worn on the middle finger of the right hand. A Knight of the West is also made to design his own coat of arms, taking the traditional European rules of heraldry into account. The resulting coat-of-arms hangs in his Provincial Grand Lodge.

The tenth degree is the highest ordinarily attainable; it can be received after roughly twenty-one years of regular attendance and good proficiency in the ritual, but the time between the degrees may be shorter if the member is active and accepts different offices in his lodges.

==Lodge Officers and Offices==
The lodges are managed by a Worshipful Master, who will be assisted by one or more Deputy Masters (these are given Latin ordinal names: primary, secondary, and so forth). There are also the Primary and Secondary Wardens, a Master of Ceremonies, a Secretary, a Treasurer, an Orator, and a Director of Music.

The lodge offices do not rotate as in e.g. American freemasonry. A mason is not obliged or expected to take up an office, nor is there a progression between the offices. E.g.: Any man holding the appropriate degree may campaign for election as Worshipful Master without ever having held any office before, and the same holds for all the other offices of the Rite.

While the Master and his deputies, as well as the Wardens, are voted in, other officers are appointed by the Master. Once elected or appointed one often keeps his position for at least some years, while the Master will usually hold his position for the better part of a decade, though Sweden has a limit of six years per term and a retirement age of 75 years old. 

There are rules dictating minimum degrees for the various officers and their substitutes. In Denmark, the officers of a St. John&#x27;s lodge must uniformly be at least Master Masons; Wardens must be Knights of the East; and the Worshipful Master must be (depending on source) a Knight of the West or a Right Enlightened Brother of St. Andrew.

Deputy officers are fully empowered to take the place of their principals at stated meetings.

==Ritual==

There is a single progression through the degrees of the Swedish Rite, as opposed to the multiple optional side degrees and appendant bodies of Anglo-American Masonry. Swedish Rite Masons join at the level of an Entered Apprentice, and, with time, become Right Enlightened Brothers of St Andrew.

The morality and symbolism taught in the St John degrees is the same as that of the Blue Lodge; in addition, Swedish Rite Master Masons and Master Masons elsewhere in the world are fully accepted as visitors in each other&#x27;s lodges. The layout of a St John&#x27;s lodge-room and that of a Blue Lodge is different from that of the Swedish Rite, as is the ritual excepting the word and grips of recognition, which are universal. 

The Swedish Rite places more emphasis on the mystical and the spiritual while the Anglo-American version of Freemasonry prioritises memorisation. According to Alex G. Davidson, the mood in an English lodge-room is &quot;relaxed and friendly&quot; compared to the &quot;mysterious and gloomy&quot;, &quot;intensely solemn and almost mystical... otherworldly atmosphere&quot; of the Swedish Rite.

While English Masonry places importance on so-called word-perfect ritual, committed to memory and repeated without a single deviation from the prepared text, the Swedish Rite focuses more strongly on the spirit of the ritual. Accordingly, Lodge officers are given a book from which to read during degree ceremonies; the task of delivering these speeches falls on an officer known as the Orator. Candidates are examined on their proficiency of the previous degree: by this is meant that, prior to being passed or raised, as appropriate, candidates are made to write down the salient points of the morality taught by the previous degree.

The way by which a Lodge in the Swedish Rite is called to work and to refreshment is also different from the English way. The Junior and Senior Wardens do not have pedestals that they set on their sides; rather, they wear handle-less, hyperboloidal mallets similar to gavels with which they strike the hilt of their swords.

==History==
The primary foundations of the Swedish Rite are from the late 18th century when Carl Friedrich Eckleff created the first St. Andrews lodge in Stockholm in 1756 and the first Grand Chapter in 1759. His ideas of a truly progressive system to continue the existing system with three degrees was further developed by Duke Karl of Södermanland, the later Charles XIII of Sweden, who also became the Grand Master of the Swedish Order of Freemasons. By 1800 the Swedish rite had fully evolved and since then has had mostly minor changes. In Denmark, the first St. Andrews Lodge started working in 1855 and the first Chapter shortly after in 1858; this effectively marked the beginning of Swedish Rite in Denmark.

==Grand Lodges using the rite==
The Swedish Rite is used by:
* The Swedish Order of Freemasons, with lodges in Sweden and Finland.
* The Norwegian Order of Freemasons
* The Danish Order of Freemasons
* The Icelandic Order of Freemasons
* The Grand Lodge of Spain, but only in the lodge of St. John&#x27;s three degrees, with Danish lodges in Fuengirola and Nerja on the Costa del Sol, and Norwegian lodges in Costa Blanca and Gran Canaria.
An earlier version of the rite, the Zinnendorf Rite, is used by:
* Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany
* The Grand Lodge of Latvia, but only in the lodges Pie Zobena, Castor, and Pie trīs kronētiem zobeniem.

<doc id="968117" wikidata="Q3048542" url="?curid=968117" title="Edward Hamilton Aitken">
<text>Edward Hamilton Aitken (16 August 1851, in Satara, India – 11 April 1909, in Edinburgh) was a civil servant in India, better known for his humorist writings on natural history in India and as a founding member of the Bombay Natural History Society. He was well known to Anglo-Indians by the pen-name of Eha.

==Early life==
&quot;Eha&quot; was born at Satara in the Bombay Presidency on 16 August 1851. His father was the Rev. James Aitken, missionary of the Free Church of Scotland. His mother was a sister of the Rev. Daniel Edward, a missionary to the Jews at Breslau for some fifty years. He was educated by his father in India. His higher education was obtained at Bombay and Pune. He passed M.A. and B.A. of Bombay University, first on the list, and won the Homejee Cursetjee prize with a poem in 1880. From 1870 to 1876, he taught Latin at the Deccan College in Pune. He also knew Greek and was known to be able to read the Greek Testament without the aid of a dictionary. He grew up in India, and it was only later in life that he visited England for the first time, and he found the weather of Edinburgh severe.


==Career==
He entered the Customs and Salt Department of the Government of Bombay in April 1876, and served in Kharaghoda (referred to as &quot;Dustypore&quot; in &quot;The Tribes on my Frontier&quot;), Uran, Uttara Kannada and Goa Frontier, Ratnagiri, and Bombay itself. In May 1903, he was appointed Chief Collector of Customs and Salt Revenue at Karachi, and in November 1905, was made Superintendent in charge of the District Gazetteer of Sind. He retired from the service in August 1906.

He married Isabella Mary, the third daughter of the Rev. J. Chalmers Blake of the Free Church of Scotland on 22 December 1883 in Bombay and they had two sons and three daughters. Their daughter - Jesse Helen, married James Hood Wilson Lownie (1887-1961), and their son Ralph became a colonial judge and author of Auld Reekie. Their grandson is the author Andrew James Hamilton Lownie.

==Natural history==
He explored the jungles on the hills near Vihar around Bombay and wrote a book called &quot;The Naturalist on the Prowl&quot;. His writing style was accurate and at the same time amusing to his readers. He studied most of his subjects in life and was very restricted in his collecting.

In response to an appeal for information on rats due to plague in Bombay, he wrote an article for &quot;The Times of India&quot; (19 July 1899), in which he threw a flood of light on the subject of the habits and characteristics of the Indian rat as found in town and country. He wrote that &quot;Mus rattus&quot;, the old English black rat, which is the common house rat of India outside the large seaports, &quot;has become, through centuries of contact with the Indian people, a domestic animal like the cat in Britain&quot;.

In 1902 he was deputed to investigate the prevalence of malaria at the Customs stations along the frontier of Goa, and to devise means for removing the position of the Salt Peons who were affected by malaria in these places. During this expedition he discovered a new species of anopheline mosquito, which after identification by Major James, I.M.S., was named after him as &quot;Anopheles aitkeni&quot;. During his service he took to writing the Annual Reports of the Customs Department and was frequently thanked for the same. Reviewers have commented that these reports are enlivened by his witty literary touch. In the last two years of his service he was put in charge of &quot;The Sind Gazetteer&quot;. On completion of this work he retired to Edinburgh. He died after a short illness on 25 April 1909.

He refused to be depressed by life in India. &quot;I am only an exile,&quot; he remarks, &quot;endeavouring to work a successful existence in Dustypore, and not to let my environment shape me as a pudding takes the shape of its mould, but to make it tributary to my own happiness.&quot; He therefore urged his readers to cultivate a hobby.

He wrote:
He worked at the museum of the Bombay Natural History Society, an organization that he founded and published many of his notes in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. He was also the first joint-editor of that journal, secretary to the Insect division of the BNHS and president for some time.

In one famous case a subordinate of EHA working in the Salt department in Kanara came to his bungalow with a snake on his shoulder. Eha wrote that the man had seen two snakes fighting and said &#x27;I smashed at them with a stick-one got away, but I killed this one and have brought it to you-What is it ?&#x27; &#x27;It is a King cobra, and you have not killed it&#x27; replied Eha. The snake was put in a crate and sent to the BNHS with the note &#x27;It may not survive the journey. If it does not you will know it by the smell. If there be no smell be careful.&#x27; The snake survived for two years in the BNHS.

He was a proponent of the study of living birds as opposed to the bird collectors of his time. He wrote in his &quot;Birds of Bombay&quot;
In a similar manner he studied the life-histories of butterflies unlike most butterfly collectors of the time.

He maintained an aquarium and made Sunday-morning expeditions to the ravines at the back of Malabar Hill to search for mosquito larvae to feed its inmates. Mr. Aitken investigated the capabilities for the destruction of larvae, of a small surface-feeding fish with an ivory-white spot on the top of its head, which he had found at Vihar in the stream below the bund. It took him some time to identify these particular fishes (&quot;Haplochilus lineatus&quot;) which he called &quot;Scooties&quot; for their lightning rapidity of their movements. With these he stocked the ornamental fountains of Bombay to keep them from becoming breeding-grounds for mosquitoes, and they are now largely used throughout India for this very purpose.

T. R. Bell, a naturalist friend, writing of him after his death said
:&quot;He was a good man in every sense of the word; a strongly religious man, a pleasant companion, broad minded, exceedingly tolerant of the weaknesses of others, gentle and lovable and a rare example of a man without a single enemy.&quot;

&quot;Eha&quot; once wrote:
He kept many pets at home and Surgeon-General Bannerman noted in his preface to Eha&#x27;s books that he often found himself having to go on unpleasant trips to the &quot;primeval forests of Cumballa Hill&quot; to look for mosquito larvae to feed the fish. In appearance Eha has been described as a &quot;long, thin, erect, bearded man...with a typically Scots face lit up with the humorous twinkle one came to know so well.&quot; A photograph taken in 1902 shows a fringe of hair encircling a bald head which is commented upon by Bannerman as &quot;a condition which &quot;Kemp&#x27;s Equatorial Hair Douche&quot; had not been able to prevent&quot;.

Despite the popular reception for his book, a contemporary review in the Pall Mall Gazette of his book &quot;Tribes on my frontier&quot; termed his work as being entirely based on the kind of humour established by Phil Robinson. The review said:
==Writings==

His books include

<text>Enno Patalas (15 October 1929, in Quakenbrück – 7 August 2018, in Munich) was a German film historian, collector, and expert film preservationist. A former head of the Munich Film Museum (1973–1994), his restorations include films such as &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;M – Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder&quot; and &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, all directed by Fritz Lang. Patalas also restored the film &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot; for viewing at the Berlin Film Festival in 2005.

He, along with director Ulrich Gregor, wrote the influential film history book &quot;Geschichte des Films&quot; (&quot;History of Film&quot;).

<doc id="968120" wikidata="Q1481648" url="?curid=968120" title="TVR S series">
<text>The TVR S series is a line of sports cars manufactured by the British company TVR between 1986 and 1994. It was announced at the 1986 British International Motor Show. The car went into production in less than 12 months, with 150 pre-manufacture orders placed at the motor show before the moulds were even made. 

This was Peter Wheeler&#x27;s first major development since buying the company from Martin Lilley, and the turning point in TVR&#x27;s fortunes. In total, TVR produced 2,604 S-series cars; 410 of these were the V8S model. The design was the return to a more traditional style, with a strong resemblance to the 1970s M series.

==S1/S2/S3(C)/S4C==
 The V6 S-series cars used Ford&#x27;s Cologne V6 in 2.8 L, (S1) and 2.9 L (2933cc), (S2–S4) forms. Deliveries of S started in September 1987 and early &quot;S&quot; cars are often referred to as &quot;S1&quot;, to distinguish them from later versions. 

The S2 was launched in 1988 introducing the 2.9-L engine. The S3 followed in 1989 with longer doors, although some late S2 cars also had these. The S3 also introduced a more traditional design of dashboard with burr walnut veneer.

S1s are becoming increasingly rare with only 78 licensed and 224 SORN.

Model names ending with &quot;c&quot; were used to denote vehicles fitted with a catalytic converter. Only the S3 and S4 were available with catalysts (and the S4 was not built without them). A catalytic converter standard in the UK was introduced in August 1992, at &quot;K&quot; registration; catalysed earlier cars were for export to markets with tighter emissions standards.
==V8S==
The V8S was launched in 1991 standard specification of the V8S included ½ hide leather interior, walnut trim, mohair hood, OZ alloy wheels, driving lamps, electric windows and door mirrors.

The V8S contains a 4.0 L fuel-injected Rover V8 engine, with gas-flowed cylinder heads, higher lift camshaft, compression ratio upped to 10:5:1, revised manifold, new chip for the engine management system and a limited slip differential. The result is at 5250 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm.

The V8S has a number of cosmetic differences over the V6. The bonnet has a large hump - created to house the Italian specification supercharger but carried over to all V8S models.

The V8S has a small vent facing the windscreen, whereas S1 to S3 models face forward. Very late S3 and S4 models had no hump at all. As with all TVRs there is no specific point in time when they changed styles; changes were gradually introduced as parts ran out.

The suspension track is slightly wider on the V8S achieved with revised wishbones at the front and revised trailing arms at the rear. Disc brakes are fitted all round.

0-60 mph could be achieved in 4.9 seconds and 0-100 mph in 12.9 seconds. Production ended in 1994

===2-litre V8S===
The TVR 2-litre V8S was a 2-litre supercharged version of the V8S - this was created for the Italian market in response to their car taxation based on engine capacity. The engine was a modified 3.5 litre Rover V8 fitted with a smaller-throw crank to reduce the engine capacity, retaining the 88.9 mm bore but with a short stroke of 40.25 mm. This meant a displacement of , with a compression rate of 8.0:1. Lucas electronic fuel injection was fitted, along with an intercooled Eaton supercharger. All of this produced at 6,200 rpm and at 3,700 rpm. Performance was on par with the bigger V8s, with a top speed of and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) coming up in 6.5 seconds. Ventilated disc brakes were fitted up front, and the 2-litre V8 also got adjustable ride height hydraulic shocks. The TVR Club estimates seven were built, and no more than ten.

<doc id="968125" wikidata="Q12008694" url="?curid=968125" title="Show dog">
<text>A show dog might refer to any dog entered into a dog show. More specifically, a &quot;show dog&quot; is a dog which has been specially bred, trained, and/or groomed to conform to the specifications of dog shows, so as to have a chance of winning. Often used as a single word (&quot;showdog&quot;), the term is also used within the sport of conformation to refer to a dog that displays a particularly energetic or outgoing character.

==Dog shows==
Entry into many sports of dog shows is restricted to purebred dogs registered with the kennel club or breed club sponsoring the show, and dogs are selected by breeding to excel at the particular sport for which they are being shown.

Dog shows may be held indoors, in horse arenas or other suitably large spaces, or outdoors on groomed fields. Events at which dogs may be shown vary in the requirements for entry and the amount of preparation required. Types of dog shows include:
* Fun shows: Usually put on by charities for fund raising, these dog shows may offer prizes for costumes or for the largest and smallest dogs entered.
* Tests and Trials: Dog shows that display a dog&#x27;s training or natural instincts. They may require a great deal of formal training of the dog, as in obedience trials, or none at all, as in herding tests. Some are entertaining spectator dog sports, such as disc dog and dock jumping, and others are of more interest to the dog than to spectators, as in earthdog trials and hunt tests.
* Conformation shows: Originally devised for the selection of breeding stock, conformation showing has evolved into a sport requiring specific training for both the dog and handler, as well as precise grooming requirements (depending on the breed being shown.)

==Criticism of dog showing==
One argument is that the kennel clubs&#x27; requirements that breeding be conducted within a breed is tantamount to mandatory, continuous inbreeding as all members of the same breed are related. Another is that whether breeding primarily for appearance or for a particularly desirable working style, too much emphasis is placed on breeding from the few winning stud dogs, causing an already limited gene pool to encounter a genetic bottleneck.«The comments above can be contributed to a very small minority of pure breed preservers who may, or may not, choose to show title their dogs»

<doc id="968128" wikidata="Q495844" url="?curid=968128" title="Tidal race">
<text>Tidal race or tidal rapid is a natural occurrence whereby a fast-moving tide passes through a constriction, resulting in the formation of waves, eddies and hazardous currents. The constriction can be a passage where the sides narrow, for example the Gulf of Corryvreckan and the Saltstraumen maelstrom, or an underwater obstruction (a reef or rising seabed), such as is found at the Portland Race in the United Kingdom.

In extreme cases, such as Skookumchuck Narrows in British Columbia, through which tides can travel at more than 17 knots (31.484 km/h), very large whirlpools develop, which can be extremely hazardous to navigation.

==Notable tidal races==
* Cape Reinga in New Zealand
* Skookumchuck Narrows in British Columbia, Canada
* The Bitches in Wales, United Kingdom
* Falls of Lora in Scotland, United Kingdom
* Portland Bill on the Isle of Portland, United Kingdom
* The Alderney Race (12 knots+) between Alderney and La Hague, Normandy, France
* The Raz de Sein in western Brittany, France
* The Fromveur Passage in western Brittany, France
* Horizontal Falls in Western Australia, Australia
* Naruto Strait between Shikoku and Awaji Islands, Japan
* Reversing Falls in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada

<text>Messier 84 or M84, also known as NGC 4374, is a giant elliptical or lenticular galaxy in the constellation Virgo. Charles Messier discovered the object in 1781 in a systematic search for &quot;nebulous objects&quot; in the night sky. It is the 84th object in the Messier Catalogue and in the heavily populated core of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, part of the local supercluster.

This galaxy has morphological classification E1, denoting it has flattening of about 10%. The extinction-corrected total luminosity in the visual band is about . The central mass-to-light ratio is 6.5, which, to a limit, steadily increases away from the core. The visible galaxy is surrounded by a massive dark matter halo.

Radio observations and Hubble Space Telescope images of M84 have revealed two jets of matter shooting out from its center as well as a disk of rapidly rotating gas and stars indicating the presence of a supermassive black hole. It also has a few young stars and star clusters, indicating star formation at a very low rate. The number of globular clusters is , which is much lower than expected for an elliptical galaxy.

Viewed from Earth its half-light radius, relative angular size of its 50% peak of lit zone of the sky, is , thus just over an arcminute.

==Supernovae==
Three supernovae have been observed in M84:
* SN 1957B (typeIa, mag. 12.5) was discovered by H. S. Gates on 28 April 1957, and independently by Dr. G. Romano on 18 May 1957.
* SN 1980I (type Ia, mag. 14) was discovered by M. Rosker on 13 June 1980. Historically, this supernova has been catalogued as belonging to M84, but it may have been in either neighboring galaxy NGC 4387 or M86.
* SN 1991bg (type Ia-pec, mag. 14) was discovered by Reiki Kushida on 3 December 1991.
This high rate of supernovae is rare for elliptical galaxies, which may indicate there is a population of stars of intermediate age in M84.

<text>Messier 85 (also known as M85 or NGC 4382 or PGC 40515 or ISD 0135852) is a lenticular galaxy, or elliptical galaxy for other authors, in the Coma Berenices constellation. It is 60 million light-years away, and has a diameter of about across. 

Pierre Méchain discovered M85 in 1781. It is within the outskirts of the Virgo cluster, and is relatively isolated.

== Properties ==
M85 is extremely poor in neutral hydrogen and has a very complex outer structure with shells and ripples that are thought to have been caused by a merger with another galaxy that took place between 4 and 7 billion years ago, as well as a relatively young (&lt;3 billion years old) stellar population on its centermost region, some of it in a ring, that may have been created by a late starburst. Like other massive, early-type galaxies, it has different populations of globular clusters. Aside from the typical &quot;red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; populations, there is also a population with intermediate colors and an even redder population. It is likely transitioning from being a lenticular galaxy into an elliptical galaxy.

While indirect methods imply that Messier 85 should contain a central supermassive black hole of around 100 million solar masses,
velocity dispersion observations imply that the galaxy may entirely lack a central massive black hole.

M85 is interacting with the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4394, and a small elliptical galaxy called MCG 3-32-38.

Compared to other early-type galaxies, M85 emits a relatively smaller proportion of X-rays.

== Novae and Supernovae ==
* SN 1960R (typeIa, mag. 13.5), was discovered by H. S. Gates on 20 December 1960, and independently discovered by Leonida Rosino on 18 January 1961.

* M85 has been the host of the first luminous red nova identified as such. On 7 January 7 the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) discovered M85 OT2006-1 on the outskirts of the galaxy.
* SN 2020nlb (type Ia, mag. 17.436) was discovered by the ATLAS telescope in Hawaii on 25 June 2020. This supernova got as bright as magnitude 12.

<doc id="968142" wikidata="Q660988" url="?curid=968142" title="HESA Azarakhsh">
<text>The HESA Azarakhsh ( &quot;Âzaraxš&quot;, &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;) is a jet fighter aircraft manufactured by the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company (HESA). It is widely regarded as a rebuilt and renamed American Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter/Tiger II although Iranian authorities claim it is Iran&#x27;s first domestically manufactured combat jet fighter.

The Azarakhsh was developed in Isfahan by the Iranian military, the Iranian Defense Ministry, and aircraft-manufacturing company HESA.

==Development==
In April 1997 Iranian Brigadier General Arasteh, a deputy head of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, declared that Iran had successfully designed, constructed and tested its first fighter aircraft. By late 1997 it was reported that Iran had begun producing the aircraft and by mid-2000 four aircraft were said to be undergoing operational tests, with production proceeding at a rate of around ten aircraft per year.

On May 17, 2000, Iran&#x27;s acting commander of the Air Force said that Azarakhsh had reached mass-production stage. 
On August 5, 2007, Azarakhsh conducted a successful test flight. On August 6, 2007, Ministry of Defense Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar said, &quot;[Azarakhsh] is now at the stage of industrial production and its mass production will start in the future.&quot;

==Design==

===Azarakhsh===
Production started by late 1997 and as of 2001 there were six aircraft reported to be in service. Iran has yet to release any additional information about the aircraft and its capabilities are unknown.

There are no known differences between the Azarakhsh and the original Northrop F-5E. Coupled with the fact only very few Azarakhsh jets have been observed since the claimed start of production indicates that the Azarakhsh is not a new-built jet fighter, but a rebuild of existing Northrop F-5s.

===Saeqeh===
The HESA Saeqeh is a follow on aircraft, derived from the Azarakhsh fighter. As with many previous indigenous Iranian developed weapons, no performance data has been released to verify official claims. An unknown number of this generation have been built and are reported to have entered service with the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) on September 22, 2007.

=== Kowsar ===

In August 2018, IAIO unveiled the Kowsar (or Kosar) jet trainer and strike aircraft. The Kowsar will be produced in single and two-seater versions.

<doc id="968144" wikidata="Q8052761" url="?curid=968144" title="Yes Please!">
<text>Yes Please! is the fourth studio album by British rock band Happy Mondays, released on 22 September 1992 through Factory Records. Following the non-album single &quot;Judge Fudge&quot;, Factory allotted the band a budget of £150,000 for their next album. After settling on producers Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, both members of Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club, Happy Mondays decamped to Blue Wave Studio in Saint Philip, Barbados, in February 1992. The sessions were plagued by a variety of issues, such as frontman Shaun Ryder developing a crack habit and dancer Bez breaking his arm three times. With little finished material and a lack of lyrics, the band returned to the United Kingdom; Ryder was admitted into a detox centre. Recording continued for two weeks in May 1992 at Comfort&#x27;s Place Studio in Lingfield, Surrey, where Ryder did his vocals. &quot;Yes Please!&quot; is a soul funk album with a bleak sound that earned it a comparison to &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; (1979) by Joy Division.

&quot;Yes Please!&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, a few of whom found it to be uninspired, while others said it had some high points. It peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart, going on to sell 50,000 copies by the end of the year. Happy Mondays toured the UK in October 1992, which was followed by a one-off Japanese show. Factory Records went into administration the next month; the band broke up in early 1993. &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot;, released as the lead single from &quot;Yes Please!&quot; on 31 August 1992, topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart in the United States and peaked at number 31 in the UK. &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;, released as the album&#x27;s second single on 9 November 1992, reached number 5 on the Dance Club Songs chart and reached number 62 in the UK.

==Background==
Happy Mondays released their third studio album, &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, on 5 November 1990. It peaked at number four in the United Kingdom; all three of its singles reached the top 20 in the UK, with &quot;Step On&quot; and &quot;Kinky Afro&quot; both peaking at number five. Around the album&#x27;s release, a newspaper article was published that detailed frontman Shaun Ryder&#x27;s past experiences with drugs, making his addiction to heroin (and toying with crack) and stint in a detox centre public in the process. A public relations representative from the band&#x27;s label, Factory Records, had to issue a statement on Ryder&#x27;s behalf, denouncing his drug use. The album was promoted with a UK arena tour, a trek to mainland Europe, and a two-month stint in the United States, ending with a variety of headlining shows and festival appearances in August 1991.

Guitarist Mark Day got married as bassist Paul Ryder&#x27;s marriage was coming to an end, resulting in him and Shaun Ryder doing more heroin. The latter Ryder increased his crack intake, while drummer Gary Whelan began suffering from depression and turned to alcohol. Rehearsals bore no new ideas; a recording session with Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne, producers of &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, resulted in &quot;Judge Fudge&quot; and the unfinished &quot;Baby Big Head&quot;. While the idea of a new album was suggested, both producers felt that the timing was not right, saying it would descend into chaos due to the state of the band. During this time, the Madchester and baggy scenes had fallen out of popularity as Nirvana released &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), allowing for the success of grunge acts such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. &quot;Judge Fudge&quot; was released as a non-album single in November 1991, charting within the UK top 30.

Despite &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; being a commercial success, Factory Records was struggling financially. To help alleviate some of it, Factory released Happy Mondays&#x27; first live album, titled &quot;Live&quot;. Factory Records had a distribution and licencing deal with major label London Recordings, which helped to push the visibility of &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot; in European countries. A potential buyout from London was threatened if Factory was unable to handle its financial security. Misguided artist development, property investments, and overspent album budgets for Happy Mondays and New Order meant that Factory had little funds left. In an attempt to recoup costs, Happy Mondays manager Nathan McGough and New Order manager Rob Gretton promised Factory founder Tony Wilson that neither of their respective bands&#x27; next albums would exceed a budget of £150,000.

==Recording==
===Selecting producers and studios===
Despite relationships between Happy Mondays members straining, Shaun Ryder told McGough they had written enough material for another album. The band and Factory Records wanted to enlist Oakenfold and Osborne for their next album, but the pair was fully booked until June 1992 at the earliest. Concerned that they could not wait that long, McGough and Wilson decided to look for other producers. Paul Ryder was listening to &quot;Conscious Party&quot; (1988) by Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, learning that it was produced by Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, and thought they would be ideal producers for Happy Mondays&#x27; next album. Around the same time, the band had a new booking agent, Ian Flooks, who also worked with Frantz and Weymouth. When Flooks caught wind that the band was looking for producers, he suggested the pair.

Frantz and Weymouth knew Wilson and were aware of the band; McGough contacted the office of the couple in early 1992. Paul Ryder and McGough subsequently flew to Connecticut to visit Frantz and Weymouth. The latter pair had been wanting to produce more albums since &quot;Conscious Party&quot;; with the demise of Talking Heads, the pair felt it was the best time to do so. They listened to &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, which impressed them, and they were convinced they could aid the band. Unlike Oakenfold and Osborne, Frantz and Weymouth understood how dynamics would work between band members due to their experience in Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club. The rest of Happy Mondays talked with the pair over the phone, telling them that they did not want to be distracted by alcohol and drugs and wanted to be taken seriously as artists.

Paul Ryder, McGough, Frantz, and Weymouth all flew to Miami to visit a studio owned by Bee Gees, with Ryder remarking it was a &quot;huge place but weird, on an industrial estate&quot;. The four of them then went to a studio in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, though it was small and lacked a lot of equipment. If they wanted to record there, it would mean they would have to rent gear and fly it to Jamaica. Ryder then suggested Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas, close to where Frantz and Weymouth had a residence. It was previously a state-of-the-art facility, but when Ryder asked Frantz about it, he told Ryder that it had flooded and was in a state of disrepair.

Happy Mondays had a meeting with McGough and Wilson, who gave the band three options on where to record: a studio in Amsterdam, which they were all against; a studio inside a formerly used church in Manchester, which was run by pop producer Pete Waterman; or a studio in Barbados. Waterman had made a pitch to produce the band&#x27;s next album, which Paul Ryder and Whelan were against while the rest of the band plus McGough were up for. Whelan stated that if they went with Waterman, he would quit. All of them went with Barbados, bar Day, who wanted to make the next album in Manchester. When asked by the band why he wanted to be in Manchester, Day reasoned that they all had families there.

During a meeting with their business expenses manager, McGough told the rest of the band that Shaun Ryder (who was absent) had sacked Day, much to their surprise. Ryder expected to replace him with Smiths guitarist and Electronic collaborator, Johnny Marr. McGough said Day was &quot;unhappy and Shaun [Ryder] felt culturally he wasn&#x27;t on board. [... Ryder] made it an issue and for half an hour one afternoon Johnny Marr was in [Happy Mondays]&quot;. Day had been fired over the phone abruptly; Paul Ryder and Whelan visited Day. Day was confused by the idea, thinking the band wanted to kick him out, until they discovered he simply needed some time off.

===Barbados sessions===
On 17 January 1992, the day after Day had re-joined the band, they flew from Manchester to The Bahamas. Factory hoped the remote location would help sedate Shaun Ryder&#x27;s heroin addiction; he had smuggled methadone (intended as a substitute for heroin) into the island, which he consumed immediately upon arrival. They were not allowed to leave the airport unless they had out-going tickets as well, which had not been booked as they were unsure as to how long they would be recording for. Day, still affected by the sack and worried about the workload ahead, had a mental breakdown. Whelan and Paul Ryder had been drinking throughout the 13-hour flight to the island and continued when the band took up residence at Sam Lord&#x27;s Castle. They were asked to leave the accommodation when they found out keyboardist Paul Davis assaulted the bar band.

They then travelled to Blue Wave Studio in Saint Philip, Barbados, which was owned by Eddy Grant. The studio itself was housed in a shack in the middle of a sugar plantation, as well as being near a jungle. It was on the driveway of Grant&#x27;s estate, who was away during this time. The studio&#x27;s manager heard unfavourable stories about the band and had to be reassured by Frantz and Weymouth that the pair would handle everything. The pair and their associates had arrived at the studio some days prior to bringing it up to standard for recording with the band, as there were issues with power outages and fluctuation. Shaun Ryder and Bez lived at the studio so that others could watch him, while the rest of the band set up on a private gated estate. Frantz, Weymouth, and the rest of the band had set up at the studio; when Shaun Ryder showed up, he was unfit to do any work.

Shaun Ryder recounted that Frantz and Weymouth saw him as a &quot;non-musician&quot;, Bez as contributing nothing to the band, and Day as having only an amateur grasp of music theory, while Davis and Paul Ryder were the &quot;best of a bad bunch&quot;. When sessions were underway, Mark Roula handled recording with assistance from Bryon Europe. Assembled in a live manner, the other members ran through the six partially-completed tracks they had for Frantz and Weymouth. The pair recorded these rehearsals with the intention of going back to them after writing more material. Frantz and Weymouth were not concerned, starting with a lack of completed songs, having dealt with this before with Talking Heads&#x27; fourth studio album &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980) and Tom Tom Club&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1981). Frantz said technician Simon Machan had some pre-programmed beats and keyboard parts that could help them, though his equipment suffered from varying power levels.

Spurred on by the pair&#x27;s enthusiasm, Day, Davis, Paul Ryder, and Whelan started having fun, recalling their early rehearsals in Manchester. Day had been influenced by Eastern music, resulting in off-kilter guitar parts. Ryder and Whelan locked into grooves, with the encouragement of Weymouth. The majority of the recording was plagued with a variety of issues with the band members. Happy Mondays discovered that the island was full of cheap crack available from local drug dealers, who knew the band was eager to purchase any drugs from them. Shaun Ryder did not enjoy the music the rest of the band was making within the first week, resulting in him and Bez seeking out drugs. He ended up spending 20 hours each day in the toilet, smoking crack, while the others were waiting to record. Bez broke his arm three times: once when crashing a car, the second time in a boat accident, and the third time when his girlfriend sat on it.

Paul Ryder began having withdrawal symptoms from the lack of heroin; as both Ryders became ill, McGough had a doctor prescribe them largactil. It resulted in neither of them having the energy left to record anything, especially Shaun Ryder, who was now unable to sing. Day and Whelan relaxed with their families on the island as they had finished their parts for the album, renting houses by the beachside. Frantz and Weymouth attempted to keep recording going, but the difficulties with the band members eventually saw the pair&#x27;s enthusiasm dissipate. The pair felt there was the foundation of ten songs recorded, waiting for Shaun Ryder&#x27;s input. Amid growing frustration from the others, Ryder had yet to write any lyrics for the new songs. They spent a few days trying to coax lyrical inspiration out of Ryder. The constant crack use saw him inflicted with a throat infection, rendering the chance of recording vocals impossible. Whelan let Ryder stay at his place in an effort to spur lyrics out of him.

When Shaun Ryder ran out of money to buy more crack, he ended up selling dealers his clothes. Reports of the band&#x27;s antics – car crashes and drug consumption – hit tabloids in the UK. One story involved the band withholding the album&#x27;s master tapes at ransom from Factory, which Whelan denied, while another stated Ryder sold the studio&#x27;s sofa for crack, to which he clarified he actually sold a sunlounger. Ryder theorised the master tape rumour came about from Frantz and Weymouth being worried about not getting paid because of Factory&#x27;s financial situation. The pair prodded Ryder to make false claims in order for the label to send them money, which Ryder estimated could not have totalled more than £10,000. Wilson had received intermittent reports about what was happening on the island. As he was in Los Angeles, California, for a few days, he considered visiting the band but ultimately decided not to.

After five weeks of recording, having spent nearly the entire recording budget, the only finished track was &quot;Cut &#x27;Em Loose Bruce&quot;. At this point, Bez and McGough had returned to the UK. The band&#x27;s US label, Elektra Records, sent A&amp;R executive Howard Thompson and a publicist to find out about the album&#x27;s progress. Frantz and Weymouth played them the vocal-less songs; Thompson was told what was happening, becoming concerned for Shaun Ryder. Thompson attempted to contact McGough, who had settled back in Manchester and was unreachable, and then Wilson, telling him the situation. Wilson was struggling with Factory&#x27;s debts and called Factory director Alan Erasmus for advice, who told him to do what he felt was best. The rest of the band then left the island on 10 March 1992 with little material finished.

===Surrey sessions===
Shaun Ryder flew to Manchester from Barbados, where he left his wife at the airport and went to find drugs. The following day, Ryder was admitted to the Charter Clinic detox centre in Chelsea, London, for a period of six weeks, with McGough supervising him. When he left, McGough decided to have Ryder avoid Manchester, subsequently booking them an apartment in Newquay for two weeks. While Ryder was in a healthier state, he still struggled with writing new lyrics. Ryder returned home for a week before going to Comfort&#x27;s Place Studio in Lingfield, Surrey, to do vocals. The sessions re-started in May 1992, with assistance from Ray Mascarenas, for a period of two weeks. Aside from visiting a local pub, Ryder otherwise kept himself free from drugs. On the advice of his doctor, the rest of the band stayed away from the sessions.

Paul Ryder and Astrella Leitch followed the latter&#x27;s father on tour; Whelan spent time at a gym; Day looked after his newly-born child; Davis moved house; and Bez tended to his broken arm. Trying to aid in the writing, Frantz and Weymouth would have Shaun Ryder do things such as dance on the spot or consult the &quot;I Ching&quot; for lyrics. They also employed William S. Burroughs&#x27; cut-up technique at Weymouth&#x27;s suggestion. Ryder found himself struggling to enjoy the music the band had done, regretting that he did not take more of an interest when they were recording it. At the time of doing these vocals, Ryder was listening to American rappers, such as Bushwick Bill; he had Kermit of Manchester-based outfit Ruthless Rap Assassins sing additional vocals on &quot;Cut &#x27;Em Loose Bruce&quot;. Kermit previously did heroin with Ryder, while Ruthless Rap Assassins had played a show with Happy Mondays sometime prior.

Rowetta, who previously did guest vocals on &quot;Pills &#x27;n&#x27; Thrills and Bellyaches&quot;, was brought in and subsequently had a large role with the new album, adding more melodies. Despite McGough&#x27;s prior promise to Wilson to not go beyond £150,000, the album ended up costing £380,000; by comparison, New Order&#x27;s respective album &quot;Republic&quot; (1993) costed £430,000. Steven Stanley travelled from Jamaica to New York City to mix the recordings. He was assisted by John Parthum at Axis Studios between 1 and 24 June 1992 with the band in attendance. Scott Hull edited and assembled the songs for Bob Ludwig, who mastered the album at Masterdisk, also in New York City. In hindsight, Wilson regretted having Frantz and Weymouth produce the band: &quot;[Bez] said to me, &#x27;Tina and Chris are brilliant [...] But their sound is the Tom Tom Club of the late seventies and early eights. You should have found us the next sound.&#x27; And he&#x27;s totally, totally right&quot;.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Yes Please!&quot; has been described as soul funk. In his biography of the band, writer Simon Spence said the album&#x27;s title was the result of the studio manager at Blue Wave Studio answering the phone: &quot;Happy Mondays... Yes Please!&quot; Shaun Ryder, on the other hand, said it was a saying their former manager, Phil Saxe, would exclaim in response to questions. He wanted to name it &quot;Rubber Lover&quot; &quot;because of the picture of &#x27;Our Lady and baby Jesus&#x27; on the sleeve&quot;. In a retrospective piece for &quot;The Quietus&quot;, writer Ben Cardew compared its bleak nature to &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; (1979) by Joy Division. Unlike that album, which relied on matching its dark lyrics with similar-sounding music, &quot;Yes Please!&quot; &quot;pairs words of weary disgust with music that forces the Caribbean surroundings in which the album was recorded through a Manchester funk filter&quot;. Shaun Ryder said he &quot;kind of gave up&quot; with the album, letting Paul Ryder and Davis pick the song titles, such as &quot;Theme from Netto&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;. Machan did programming and sampling, while Bruce Martin provided percussion, as well as additional programming and samples.

&quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot; details Shaun Ryder&#x27;s time in rehabilitation. Its title phrase came from an American doctor who treated Ryder: &quot;Listen, don&#x27;t be thinking negative thoughts, it&#x27;s stinking thinking&quot;. Part of the lyrics also deal with the relationships between band members and the state of Factory Records, as well as being lifted from a Brian Eno interview. &quot;Monkey in the Family&quot; is a bass-centric track with an electro song arrangement in the style of EMF and Jesus Jones and Arabic vocalizations. Ryder said the lyrics stemmed from Frantz writing down various words and telling him to include as many of them as he could. &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot; is driven by Talking Heads-lite percussion, with a gospel-esque chorus section from Rowetta. &quot;Dustman&quot; sees Ryder yelling the lyrics incomprehensibly and out of time with the music, which consisted of bongos, scratch guitar playing, and a Hammond organ.

&quot;Angel&quot; is about visiting a doctor; part of the lyrics were lifted from a newspaper article that quoted Marlene Dietrich. Shaun Ryder wrote &quot;Cut &#x27;em Loose Bruce&quot; after hearing a story of a judge letting crack users off scot-free. With the song, Whelan said the band attempted to make darker Caribbean music. &quot;Theme from Netto&quot; is an instrumental track – Ryder claimed &quot;Netto is Mancunian for Nothing&quot; – that Davis wanted to write and is followed by the 1970s disco song &quot;Love Child&quot;. The final song of the album, &quot;Cowboy Dave&quot;, was written in reference to Dave Rowbotham, former guitarist of Factory band the Durutti Column, who was murdered by an unknown assailant; the song speculates that the perpetrator was his girlfriend, who discovered his body. The members of Happy Mondays were questioned by the police as they were Factory associates and involved with drugs. Ryder said the lyrics were &quot;what was said in that police interview, pretty much word for word&quot;.

==Release==
===Factory Records&#x27; collapse and singles===
As recording finished, McGough set about acquiring the band money. On the verge of receivership, Factory Records entered into a deal with London Recordings owner PolyGram, who would assume ownership of Factory. Since Factory was occupied, McGough has managed to gain funds from the band&#x27;s music publishing royalties, in the area of £250,000. It arrived in staggered payments of £45,000. As Shaun Ryder enacted a legal clause allowing him £20,000 of that sum, Day, Davis, Paul Ryder, and Whelan received £5,000 each. The situation repeated itself twice later in the year; Day said they were &quot;all pissed off about the money&quot;. Around this time, Shaun Ryder had restarted his alcohol and heroin habits.

&quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot; was picked by both Ryders as the lead single from the album; released on 31 August 1992, it included &quot;Baby Big Head&quot; and Stephen Hague and Boy&#x27;s Own remixes of &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot; as its B-sides. The music video for &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot;, shot at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush&#x27;s shopping centre in London, placed a focus on Bez and Shaun Ryder, and the director had a disliking for the rest of the band. They performed the song on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; Ryder sang his vocals live and forgot the words partway through, prompting the need to read off a sheet.

&quot;Yes Please!&quot; was released on 22 September 1992. Matthew Robertson wrote in his book &quot;Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album&quot; (2006) that Central Station Design, who made the artwork, was influenced by &quot;naïve religious icons and shrines&quot; from territories such as Barbados, with the final creation alluding to the religious imagery of the album&#x27;s lyrics. The back cover features a painting done by the sister of one of the designers, who had Down syndrome; it had been in the company&#x27;s offices some years prior. In preparation for an upcoming tour, McGough had the band set up in a rehearsal space in Ancoats. Shaun Ryder was absent from the practices, while Paul Ryder was suffering from a heroin addiction, and Day, Davis, and Whelan were unsure about the future of the band. They embarked on a stint in the UK in October 1992 with support from Stereo MC&#x27;s; several of the shows sold out in advance, with a handful more being added as a result. Happy Mondays then played a one-off show in Japan with Big Audio Dynamite.

&quot;Sunshine and Love&quot; was released as the second single from the album on 9 November 1992, with a cover of &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot; (1977) by Bee Gees and remixes of &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; as its B-sides. For the artwork, Robertson said the Central Station Design team harkened back to the designs they did for the band&#x27;s early singles while incorporating the &quot;tactile qualities&quot; of the &quot;Yes Please!&quot; artwork, such as hand-drawn, cut-out shapes. It was delayed from its initial October 1992 date as Factory was struggling to find a pressing plant that would give them credit. Wilson had corralled about £1,000 to make a music video for &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;. Shaun Ryder refused to leave his band for the filming. The single was released in the US on 18 January 1993, with all of the UK B-sides plus the addition of &quot;Judge Fudge&quot;.

Factory Records&#x27; deal with London Recordings fell through when a document signed by Factory&#x27;s directors was found stating that the &quot;musicians own the music and we own nothing&quot;, rendering their assets worthless. Their would-be owner withdrew from receivership as a result. Factory went into administration, a decision that was made public on 23 November 1992. As Factory was folding, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that Happy Mondays were looking for a new record deal. London Recordings attempted to sign the band for a three-album contract, having recently acquired New Order. Happy Mondays had a large debt with the label, stemming from the previous European deal Factory had with them.

===Potential labels and break-up===
Elektra Records were looking to extend their contract with the band for another album due to the success of one &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot; remix in that territory. All of the money the band accrued from the extension would be taken by London to recoup the debt, should they choose to sign with them. A tour of Germany in December 1992 was cancelled. McGough had secured a contract with EMI; in February 1993, the band were in their rehearsal room with Clive Black, a representative from the label. Shaun Ryder announced he was leaving to purchase &quot;Kentucky&quot;, a term used for heroin. After several hours without Ryder re-appearing, Black left.

In an attempt to rescue the deal, Black told McGough to have Shaun Ryder meet him in London. After unsuccessful persuasion, Black ended up calling Ryder, telling him he was pulling the deal. Ryder&#x27;s response was to blame Davis, who had done nothing wrong. Black then told McGough the deal was off; McGough proceeded to call each member to tell them he was quitting. A band meeting was later held with McGough, where Ryder apologized for the situation with EMI. They briefly discussed taking a year-long break; by the meeting&#x27;s conclusion, Ryder was begging the others to give the band another chance. As they were aware it would be difficult to revive interest from EMI, they broke up.

===Reissues and related releases===
&quot;Yes Please!&quot; was later reissued in 2000 through London Recordings. It was included in Rhino Records&#x27; &quot;Original Album Series&quot; box set in 2013, which collected the band&#x27;s first four studio albums. The album was re-pressed on vinyl in 2020 alongside their first three albums.

&quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot; were included on Happy Mondays&#x27; first two compilation albums, &quot;Double Easy – The U.S. Singles&quot; (1993) and &quot;Loads&quot; (1995). &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot; appeared alone on their third and fifth compilation albums, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1999) and &quot;Double Double Good: The Best of Happy Mondays&quot; (2012). &quot;Stinkin&#x27; Thinkin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot;, &quot;Cut &#x27;Em Loose Bruce&quot;, and &quot;Theme from Netto&quot; featured on the band&#x27;s fourth compilation album, &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; (2005).

==Reception==

Author John Warburton in his book &quot;Hallelujah!: The Extraordinary Story of Shaun Ryder and Happy Mondays&quot; said &quot;Yes Please!&quot; was &quot;slammed by the critics as anodyne, uninspired and pedestrian&quot;, while author Lisa Verrico in her book &quot;High Life &#x27;N&#x27; Low Down Dirty: The Thrills and Spills of Shaun Ryder&quot; wrote that &quot;[e]ven the weekly press [...] had to concede that &quot;...Yes Please!&quot; had its highlights&quot;. The staff at &quot;Q&quot; said the band was &quot;back on the case&quot; and &quot;against all odds, they&#x27;ve pulled it off again&quot;. The staff at &quot;Melody Maker&quot; called it &quot;actually pretty good. At best, we&#x27;re talking about the oceanic funk of late, late Can; at worst, a typically tropical soundtrack to the Mondays&#x27; expensive vacation&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; said that despite the band&#x27;s attitude over the preceding two years, &quot;they&#x27;re back again, unflinching and honest and sick after their own shaggy fashion&quot;.

For &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, Doug Brod and Michael Krugman said that due to the rift between Shaun Ryder and his bandmates, the album &quot;often feels like a document of a band at odds with itself — the sprightly dance tracks clash with Shaun&#x27;s deeply bent mindfuck wordiness.&quot; Doug Iverson of &quot;The Blade&quot; saw the album as a regression, with the band&#x27;s energy being compromised by Frantz and Weymouth. &quot;Spin&quot; Al Weisel, on the other hand, saw it as a &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; release, aided by the band and Frantz and Weymouth sharing a &quot;similar philosophy: &#x27;Who needs to think when your feet just go? Cardew said it was &quot;steeped in age and regret, haunted by a 30-year-old Shaun Ryder who surveys the wreckage of his life and doesn&#x27;t like what he sees.&quot; In a review for &quot;Select&quot;, journalist Andrew Harrison saw it as &quot;so disappointing&quot;, describing it as an &quot;unwieldy collision of beach-barbie niceness with the products of Shaun Ryder&#x27;s depraved extracurricular activities&quot;.

&quot;Yes Please!&quot; peaked at number 14 in the UK, selling 30,000 copies in its first week of release. By the end of the year, sales stood at 50,000. The album also charted at number 99 in Australia. &quot;Stinkin Thinkin&quot; charted on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts at number 1 on Dance Club Songs, number 15 on Dance Singles Sales, and number 21 on Alternative Airplay. It also appeared at number 31 in the UK. &quot;Sunshine and Love&quot; peaked at number 5 on the Dance Club Songs chart in the US and at number 62 in the UK. &quot;Yes Please!&quot; was included in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s 2010 list of &quot;ten career-killing albums&quot; of the 1990s.

<text>Mouse Systems Corporation (MSC), formerly Rodent Associates, was founded in 1982 by Steve Kirsch. The company was responsible for bringing the mouse to the IBM PC for the first time.

==History==
Mouse Systems&#x27; optical mouse, wired to a Sun workstation and an Atari 400 running &quot;Missile Command&quot;, attracted many observers at the October, 1982 Mini/Micro &#x27;82 conference in Anaheim, California, attended by over people—and won a &quot;best new product&quot; award.

In 1984, MSC acquired rights to Mouse Draw from Microtex Industries, written by Doug Wolfgram. Mouse Systems wanted the software re-developed to look more like Apple&#x27;s MacPaint so Wolfgram brought in co-developer John Bridges and together they re-wrote the program in C with an updated user interface and called it PCPaint. Millions of copies were shipped, primarily bundled with all their mice until 1987.

KYE Systems, producer of the Genius brand of mice, acquired Mouse Systems in 1990.

==Technical details==

Like all early optical mice, their debut product relied on a special metallic and reflective mousepad printed with a square grid of grey and blue tracking lines: as the device moved over the pad, light emitted by an LED was reflected by the pad onto an array of sensors whose output was processed by an on-board controller, which in turn supplied the host computer with machine-readable tracking data via an RS-232 serial port. When connected to a regular RS-232 port, an external power supply was required. Some mice would derive their power supply from the keyboard connector on the motherboard and came with a pass-through connector to be inserted before the keyboard cable.

Early Sun workstations used MSC optical mice exclusively. The mouse was connected via a dedicated connector with power, obviating the need for a separate power supply for the mouse. Initial models came with large mousepads with well-spaced lines, while later models were smaller and used a much tighter grid.

<doc id="968152" wikidata="Q2531912" url="?curid=968152" title="Volksfront">
<text>Volksfront, also known as Volksfront International, was an American white separatist organization founded on October 20, 1994, in Portland, Oregon. According to Volksfront&#x27;s now defunct website, the group described itself as an &quot;international fraternal organization for persons of European descent.&quot; The logo of Volksfront was the Algiz rune, a common rune used as a neo-Nazi symbol common among other organizations such as National Alliance. Volksfront had approximately 50 members in the United States split between four chapters designated as Pac-West, Central States, North East, and Gulf-Atlantic, and an additional 50 members dispersed in other countries including Germany, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Spain. The goal of the movement was to create an all-White homeland in the Pacific Northwest. The flag of Volksfront was based on the Nazi flag in the colors of black, white, and red with the Volksfront logo and the slogan was &quot;Race Over All&quot; implying that race mattered over everything else. In August 2012, the United States branch of Volksfront announced their dissolution via their website. Citing harassment and investigations by the authorities, the group said it was disbanding.

The Anti-Defamation League has written that Volksfront was &quot;one of the most active skinhead groups in the United States.&quot; The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) included Volksfront in its list of hate groups. The group has been called &quot;neo-Nazi&quot; and a &quot;racist-skinhead group&quot; in press reports.

==History==
Volksfront (from the Dutch/German for &quot;people&#x27;s front&quot;) was founded by Randal Lee Krager and Richard Arden while incarcerated in an Oregon state prison in 1994. Formed from the remnants of several fractured Portland skinhead gangs in 1994, including East Side White Pride, whose members were convicted of the murder of Ethiopian Immigrant Mulegeta Seraw.&lt;/ref&gt; Krager was serving two years for a 1992 assault on an African-American man who was left paralyzed and a conviction of first-degree intimidation for threatening to murder an anti-fascist activist, Pan Nesbitt. A grand jury declined to indict him for charges involving hate crimes, but the judge doubled the length of his sentence due to Krager having a swastika tattoo. Krager did not agree with the sentence as he claimed that the judge denied him the right to bring in evidence. Krager contended the victim was attempting a sexual assault, although no charges were brought against the victim. After being paroled in 1996, Krager&#x27;s recruiting efforts made Volksfront a potent force along the West Coast. According to Krager&#x27;s parole officer, Krager distributed Nazi leaflets and frequently met with white supremacist associates. Krager told reporter Philip Dawdy of the &quot;Willamette Week&quot; that America was becoming too brown, diluting its &quot;European-American culture,&quot; and that all minorities in the Northwest &quot;will be repatriated.&quot;

A number of Volksfront&#x27;s members were linked with the Hammerskins, a white supremacist group formed in Texas, and Blood &amp; Honour, a group founded in the United Kingdom in 1987. One of Volksfront&#x27;s stated goals was to create an all-white private community. Volksfront held several events, including weekend-long concerts with speeches, two or three times a year. The group also held organizational gatherings and memorial parties in remembrance of white nationalists who had been murdered or imprisoned around the world. An annual Volksfront event called Althing was held south of St. Louis, Missouri at the group&#x27;s Samuel Weaver Memorial Hall, which was named after the son of Randy Weaver, who was killed by federal agents in 1992. Althing is a reference to the ancient parliamentary system of Scandinavia.

In late 2001, Volksfront requested to join the Coalition Against Hate Crimes (CAHC), an organization based in Oregon which had been started by the American Jewish Committee. In an anonymous email, an alleged Volksfront member wrote &quot;I think we would represent a currently unrepresented segment of our society on the issue of hate crimes and would therefore be a big asset.&quot; A CAHC representative stated &quot;They weren&#x27;t trying to join us because they believed what we believed. That was not their purpose.&quot; In the end, Volksfront was not invited to join CAHC. The Southern Poverty Law Center commented on the non-acceptance by stating that Volksfront was &quot;working to turn the Pacific Northwest into an all-white Aryan homeland—an end it says it will reach by deporting people of color.&quot;

In June 2004, Kurtis Monschke, 20, an alleged probationary member for Volksfront, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the murder of Randall Mark Townsend, 42, in Tacoma, Washington, on March 23, 2003. Volksfront denies that Mr. Monschke was a member of the organization. Prosecutors alleged that Monschke, who has the Volksfront emblem tattooed on his chest adjacent to a swastika, instigated the attack in an effort to establish himself with higher-ranking members of Volksfront. During the trial, the defense admitted that Monschke was a member of Volksfront but asserted that the organization was nonviolent. Volksfront immediately condemned the attack and urged those involved be prosecuted.

In April 2007, Jacob Albert Laskey, alleged to be Volksfront&#x27;s Prisoner Affairs Coordinator in Eugene, Oregon, was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison for his role in a &quot;racially-motivated attack&quot; on the Temple Beth Israel. According to the FBI, Laskey is a &quot;self-avowed white supremacist who admitted that he sought to commit acts of violence and destruction against Jews, African-Americans, and members of other ethnic and racial groups.&quot; A few months later in November 2007, Laskey&#x27;s brother, Gabriel Laskey, was sentenced to six months&#x27; incarceration for his role in the attack.

Volksfront was alleged to have been involved in, or had knowledge of, the shooting of Luke Querner, an anti-racist activist in Portland. No charges have been brought.

In August 2012, after Wade Michael Page committed the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting, it became known that his girlfriend, Misty Cook, had been associated with Volksfront. A few days later, the group announced via its website that Volkfront was disbanding, citing concerns over law enforcement investigations into their members. The website ceased operations shortly thereafter, along with a blog and Facebook page.

According to the Anti-Defamation League, Volksfront was a virulently racist, rebellious, anti-authoritarian and anti-semitic group that had become the most active neo-Nazi group on the west coast of the United States, and which maintained close alliances with many other hate groups.

<text>Zürich Stadelhofen railway station () is an important local railway station in the city of Zürich, on the Zürich-Rapperswil, Zürich-Winterthur, Zürich-Uster lines of the SBB CFF FFS (Swiss Federal Railways). An adjacent station, , is the terminus of the Forchbahn (FB) suburban railway and is served by several lines of the Zürich tram network.

Stadelhofen lies close to the Zürich Opera House and near Bellevue Square. It is located in the city centre next to Lake Zürich and constitutes an early work by architect Santiago Calatrava in the city where he had studied.

== History ==

Stadelhofen station opened in 1894, at the same time as the Lake Zürich right bank railway (&quot;Rechtsufrige Zürichseebahn&quot;) from Zürich Hauptbahnhof to Rapperswil station. Until 1990, the station was an intermediate stop on this single track line, which departed from the Hauptbahnhof in a westerly direction, before performing a clockwise 270 degrees turn via a viaduct over the River Limmat and passing through Letten station and the Letten tunnel to Stadelhofen. By rail the distance between the Hauptbahnhof and Stadelhofen was some , despite the fact that they are only apart in a straight line.

In 1990 there were major changes to the railway geography of this part of Zürich. To the north of Stadelhofen, the Letten tunnel was closed and replaced by the twin-track Hirschengraben tunnel, which took a direct route under the River Limmat to Hauptbahnhof, serving new through low level platforms there. At the same time a junction was formed to the south of Stadelhofen, allowing trains leaving Zurich to take either the original right bank line to Tiefenbrunnen station and onwards to Rapperswil, or to travel via the newly built Zürichberg Tunnel to Stettbach station and points to the east and north of Zurich.

Stadelhofen therefore became part of the through west–east backbone of the Zürich S-Bahn, and was rebuilt into its current form with an additional platform and enhanced station infrastructure.
== Layout and facilities ==
The station is situated to the south-east of Zürich city centre, adjacent to the &quot;Stadelhofen&quot; city square. The station is on a gentle curve, aligned roughly north to south, with the main station building and square to the west, and a rising hillside to the east. The station has three tracks, alongside a side platform to the west and an island platform to the east. The rail approaches at both ends are in tunnel, with the Hirschengraben Tunnel to Zürich Hauptbahnhof to the north. To the south the line divides inside the tunnel, with one route traversing the Zürichberg Tunnel to Stettbach station and the other a single track tunnel to Tiefenbrunnen station.

The station can be accessed from either side. An underground retail arcade runs the length of the station below the tracks and provides access between the platforms and station entrances. Underground access is supplemented by two bridges which span the station, one carrying a footpath and the other restricted road traffic.

== Operation ==
Stadelhofen station is a nodal point of the Zürich transport network. The main station is served by lines S3, S5, S6, S7, S9, S11, S12, S15 and S16 of the Zürich S-Bahn, running on the SBB lines. The S20 and S23 provide additional peak-hour service. S-Bahn line S18, running over the Forchbahn, leaves from outside the station, at a stop on &quot;Stadelhofenplatz&quot;.

All trains from the main Stadelhofen station operate via the Hirschengraben Tunnel and low-level platforms 41–44 at Hauptbahnhof, continuing to Hardbrücke station. They provide, for most of the day, 18 trains per hour (tph) to or from these central Zürich stations. Other stations served include:

The Forchbahn (line S18) runs from the &quot;Stadelhofenplatz&quot; stop via Forch to Esslingen. The &quot;Stadelhofenplatz&quot; stop is also served by tram routes 8, 11 and 15 of the Verkehrsbetriebe Zürich, whilst the same operators tram routes 2 and 4 serve the nearby &quot;Opernhaus&quot; stop. Trams and buses connect Stadelhofen to areas both inside and outside of the city of Zürich.

== Architecture ==
The existing Stadelhofen station building dates from 1894, and was built in a neoclassical style reflecting the surrounding buildings. In the 1990s the train station was rebuilt by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. The principal challenge of this rebuild was to add a third track to a station constrained by a steep hillside rising above the station to one side, and an urban square to the other.

The resulting design preserved the existing station building on the square side, and excavated the hillside to provide room for the third track and the platform serving it. The hillside was then restored with a multilevel structure that reinstates the walkways and bank above, while providing an open, naturally lit island platform underneath serving the new track and its pre-existing neighbour. The massive canopy over this platform is complemented by a much lighter metal and glass canopy over the platform on the square side of the station. An underground arcade was created beneath the length of the station, providing retail space as well as access between the platforms and station entrances. The arcade is framed by sculptural arches, and is naturally lit through glass blocks embedded on the platforms. As well as the underground arcade, two bridges span the station, linking the city on each side.

Both station building and platforms are inscribed on the Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National Significance.

<text>Messier 86 (also known as M86 or NGC 4406) is an elliptical or lenticular galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781. M86 lies in the heart of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies and forms a most conspicuous group with another large galaxy known as Messier 84. It displays the highest blue shift of all Messier objects, as it is, net of its other vectors of travel, approaching the Milky Way at 244 km/s. This is due to both galaxies falling roughly towards the center of the Virgo cluster from opposing ends.

Messier 86 is linked by several filaments of ionized gas to the severely disrupted spiral galaxy NGC 4438, indicating that M86 may have stripped some gas and interstellar dust from the spiral. It is also suffering ram-pressure stripping as it moves at high speed through Virgo&#x27;s intracluster medium, losing its interstellar medium and leaving behind a very long trail of X ray-emitting hot gas that has been detected with the help of the Chandra space telescope.

Messier 86 has a rich array of globular clusters, with a total number of around 3,800. Its halo also has a number of stellar streams interpreted as remnants of dwarf galaxies that have been disrupted and absorbed by this galaxy.

<text>Zumikon is a municipality in the district of Meilen in the canton of Zürich in Switzerland. It is located in the Pfannenstiel region.

==History==

The source of the name &quot;Zumikon&quot; originated in the year 946 AD, from a hamlet named Zuminga. At the start of the 17th century, the population was just 100, and most of these were farmers. Until 1707, Zumikon was a separate municipality, and the integral part of Waltikon was independent too, along with Gössikon. This lasted until 1804. In the early 20th century, Zumikon remained a farm village claiming only 587 inhabitants in 1900. The Waltikon area was practically unbuilt territory.
The community centre (&quot;Gemeinschaftszentrum&quot;) was built in 1980, and that was when modern Zumikon took its form. The mayor of Zumikon at that time was Elisabeth Kopp who was to become the first female Swiss federal councillor in 1984. Zumikon is now a small town, consisting of mostly wealthy residents instead of farmers. Important schools—such as the Farlifang School and the Inter-Community School Zürich—are in the area.

<text>Messier 88 (also known as M88 or NGC 4501) is a spiral galaxy about 50 to 60 million light-years away from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.

==Properties==

M88 is one of the fifteen Messier objects that belong to the nearby Virgo Cluster of galaxies. It is galaxy number 1401 in the Virgo Cluster Catalogue (VCC) of 2096 galaxies that are candidate members of the cluster. M88 appears to be on or ending a highly elliptical orbit, currently on an approximate or direct course toward the cluster center, which is occupied by the giant elliptical galaxy M87. It is currently 0.3 to 0.48 million parsecs from the center and will come closest to the core in about 200 to 300 million years. Its motion through the intergalactic medium of its cluster is creating, as expected, ram pressure that is stripping away the outer region of neutral hydrogen. To date, this has been detected along the western, leading edge of the galaxy.

This galaxy is inclined to the line of sight by 64°. It is classified as an Sbc spiral, a status between Sb (medium-wound) and Sc (loosely wound) spiral arms. The spiralling arms are very regular and can be followed down to the galactic core. The maximum rotation velocity of the gas is 241.6 ± 4.5 km/s.

M88 is classified as a type 2 Seyfert galaxy, which means it produces narrow spectral line emission from highly ionized gas in the nucleus. In the core region there is a central condensation with a 230 parsec diameter, which has two concentration peaks. This condensation is being fed by inflow from the spiral arms. The supermassive black hole at the core of this galaxy has 107.9 solar masses, or about 80 million solar masses ().

One supernova has been observed in M88: SN 1999cl (type Ia, mag. 16.4).

<text>The Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California is a non-profit, non-partisan educational organization based in Northern California. Founded in 1903, it is the oldest and largest public affairs forum in the United States. Membership is open to everyone.

==Activities==
The Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California has over 20,000 members and organizes hundreds of programs each year on topics ranging across politics, culture, society, and the economy. Around 100,000 people attend these events in person annually. The club has 56 employees and an annual budget of $11.5 million. It is currently headed by an expert on international security and arms negotiations, former Pentagon official and businesswoman, Gloria Duffy, and attorney and foreign policy expert Philip W. Yun. Club events are broadcast on many public and commercial radio stations in the longest-lasting continuous radio program in the nation. Recordings of these programs are deposited at Stanford University&#x27;s Hoover Institution Archives.

The club has radio broadcast its fora since 1924, and current broadcasts are carried weekly by about 230 public and commercial radio stations across the nation. Local residents in the Bay Area can view televised programs from The Club on KGO TV, and the club live streams or archives video of its programs on Facebook and YouTube as well as posting them on the club&#x27;s website. The club&#x27;s podcast is at iTunes and on the club&#x27;s website and a bi-monthly magazine, &quot;The Commonwealth&quot;, is available to club members.

In addition to hosting speeches and panels, in the late 1990s the club resumed its early role initiating public policy projects. These have included Voices of Reform, a nonpartisan effort to bring together California&#x27;s policy makers and opinion leaders to improve state governance. Voices of Reform became the independent organization California Forward. Similarly, the club&#x27;s California Media Project merged into California Watch, part of the Center for Investigative Reporting.

The club also offers travel programs, with educational trips abroad each year to destinations such as Turkey, Southeast Asia, and Iran.

The Commonwealth Club occasionally comes under criticism from people who think it represents one or another political philosophy, and they often center upon criticism of specific speakers with whom the critics disagree. But the club&#x27;s more than 400 events a year feature speakers from a wide range of viewpoints—conservative and liberal and moderate and radical, religious and secular, pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian.

===California Book Awards===
The Commonwealth Club sponsors the California Book Awards, which were initiated in 1931 to honor &quot;exceptional literary merit of California writers and publishers&quot;. The California Book Awards are funded by an endowment from Dr. Martha Heasley Cox, late Professor of American Literature at San Jose State University. Medals (gold and silver) and cash prizes are currently awarded in the categories of Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, First Work of Fiction, Californiana (fiction or nonfiction relating to California), Juvenile Literature (up to age 10), Young Adult Literature (age 11–16), and Notable Contribution to Publishing. The winning books are selected by an independent jury.

In late 2023, The Commonwealth Club of California merged with World Affairs of Northern California to form The Commonwealth Club World Affairs of California. It is headquartered in the Club&#x27;s existing home on the San Francisco waterfront.

== History ==
The Commonwealth Club was founded in 1903 by Edward F. Adams, the Agricultural Editor at the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; newspaper. At its first meeting, Adams read a paper now regarded as the founding document of the club, in which he wrote &quot;I have no fear of lack of following so long as it is self-evident that we only propose to find truth and turn it loose in the world

Four prominent California leaders—University of California president Benjamin Ide Wheeler, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; managing editor John P. Young, San Francisco Normal School (later San Francisco State University) president Frederick Burk, and William P. Lawler, a judge who later became a California Supreme Court Justice—co-founded the organization with Adams. The original name for the Club was &quot;The Agora,&quot; which in Greek means an open place of civic assembly, but it was quickly changed to &quot;Commonwealth Club,&quot; connoting a quest for the common good. The first president of the club was merchant, author, and public official Harris Weinstock.

Other initial club members included Bank of America founder A. P. Giannini, architect Bernard Maybeck, U.S. President Herbert Hoover, Bechtel Corporation founder W. A. Bechtel, members of the Haas family who headed Levi Strauss, Inc., U.S. Senator James Phelan, San Francisco Mayor and California Governor James &quot;Sunny Jim&quot; Rolph, Matson Navigation founder William P. Roth, Stanford University president and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur, M.D., Bank of California/Union Bank founder William Chapman Ralston, Crown Zellerbach founder J. C. Zellerbach, department store founder Joseph Magnin, California Governor J. N. Gillette, Italian Swiss Colony winery founder Carlo Rossi, and Isaias Hellman, prominent West Coast financier and first president of Wells Fargo Bank. Their goal was cooperation on civic betterment in spite of political and ideological differences. Speakers were invited to address club members to inform them about different perspectives on important issues, after which in its early days the club membership often issued reports, statements, or recommendations on public policy issues.

Presidents of the club in the second half of the 20th century included actress and Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, California Supreme Court Justice Ming Chin, and UCSF Chancellor Julius Krevans. Club members include prominent national leaders like former Secretary of State George Shultz and former Defense Secretary William Perry, as well as citizens from professions such as business, law, medicine, teaching, the arts, technology and journalism.

The club has hosted numerous world-class speakers including many U.S. presidents and other major political leaders in the United States and abroad, business leaders, and influential social activists. Speakers receive no honoraria. The club&#x27;s digital and pre-digital speeches and other records since 1903 are archived at the Hoover Library at Stanford University. 

In 2002, The Commonwealth Club launched Inforum, dedicated to serving the needs of people in their 20s and 30s interested in non-partisan public affairs. In 2007, the club created Climate One to bring together academics, industry, and activists on all sides of energy and climate change issues for discussion and planning.

The club has its headquarters in San Francisco. Though the majority of its programs are in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Marin County and Lafayette (in the East Bay area northeast of San Francisco), it also hosts occasional events in Sacramento, Southern California and Washington, D.C. A second, small office serving Silicon Valley is in Milpitas, California.

In September 2017, the club celebrated the opening of its first owned headquarters, a 24,000 square ft, $33 million building, on the San Francisco waterfront at 110 The Embarcadero. The building was designed by Leddy Maytum Stacy, a San Francisco architectural firm and winner of the American Institute of Architects 2017 Firm Award. The building is specifically designed to be a civic forum, with auditoriums, the Meyer Sound Constellation system, Copper Loop hearing technology, informal conversation areas, audio-video production facilities, digital information screens and other unique elements to serve the club&#x27;s mission. It is also a historic restoration of a building that was the first headquarters of the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Union. The club&#x27;s HQ is environmentally sustainable, with features including cooling with outside air, paneling with wood reclaimed from the original building on the site, LED lighting and tile and carpeting with recycled content. It is also located close to public transit facilities serving the Bay Area.

==Speakers==

The list of notable speakers and speeches numbers in the thousands and includes domestic and foreign political and military leaders, Nobel prize-winning scientists, authors, activists, and artists. A book of important club speeches, &quot;Each a Mighty Voice&quot;, was published in 2004 by Heyday Books.

President Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered his New Deal speech at the club. While in office, President Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke at the club, as did Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. During his term as Vice President, Dan Quayle delivered his famous &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; speech to the group. In 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave only her third public speech since taking office at the club. Other major recent speakers include former Vice President Al Gore; filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola; comedian John Cleese; former secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice, George Shultz, James Baker, and Madeleine Albright; California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger; Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen; authors Christopher Hitchens, Michael Crichton, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Greg Mortenson; microcredit entrepreneur and Nobel Prize Winner Muhammad Yunus; historian Victor Davis Hanson; airline pilot Chesley Sullenberger; CIA Director Leon Panetta; former NBA star Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and business leaders Eric Schmidt, Richard Kovacevich and David O&#x27;Reilly.

Growing out of Study Sections that were formed in the club&#x27;s early days, today the club has fifteen ongoing member-led fora, each of which meets frequently to host speakers and engage in discussion on topics including the arts, bay gourmet (food and wine), Asia-Pacific affairs, business and leadership, environment and natural resources, grownups (second half of life issues), health and medicine, humanities, international relations, LGBT issues, the Middle East, personal growth, psychology, and science and technology.

An intensive look at a single subject is sponsored each August through the club&#x27;s Platforum, where events are held daily throughout the month on the topic, examined from the perspective of many different fields. Annual Platforum topics have included &quot;China Rising&quot; (2006), &quot;Cool Clear Water&quot; (2007), &quot;How We Eat&quot; (2008), &quot;For Richer, for Poorer: Surviving and Thriving in the Great Recession&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Ascent of Woman&quot; (2010). The Platforum series include not just lectures and discussions, but often meals, travel, and experiential learning such as kayaking on San Francisco Bay (Cool Clear Water).

Inforum is the club&#x27;s division for younger community members. Since its founding in 2002 Inforum has engaged a new generation in civic discussion through its lively and controversial programming.

== Projects ==

Over the years a number of issues have been studied in depth by club leaders, member committees, or scholars commissioned by the Commonwealth Club. Among the topics studied have been direct democracy (the initiative process), air pollution, a statewide water plan, restrictions on child labor, automobile and industrial accident compensation, and legislative procedures. The long-standing mandate of many such studies has been &quot;to investigate and discuss problems affecting the welfare of the Commonwealth and to aid in their solution.&quot; Many policy innovations in California—such as public defenders&#x27; offices and a printed voter explanation booklet to go with ballots—originated in studies and discussions at the Commonwealth Club.

One of the most extensive of these studies was commissioned in 1953 and lasted until 1956. It resulted in the book &quot;California Social Welfare: Legislation, Financing, Services, Statistics&quot; published by Prentice-Hall. Vaughn Davis Bornet, a recent Ph.D. recipient from Stanford University at the time, authored the book.

The club produced &quot;Final Choice&quot;, a documentary that aired on PBS in 1998. It followed the families of three terminally ill individuals and explored the issue of physician-assisted suicide.

From 2003 to 2007, the project &quot;Voices of Reform&quot; examined the need for improvements in state governance in California. VOR led to the establishment in 2008 of the independent reform organization California Forward.

One current initiative is Climate One, directed by Greg Dalton, which convenes leaders from business, government, and civil society to discuss a low-carbon, global economy. Climate One holds private leadership roundtables as well as public discussions and gives the annual Stephen Schneider Climate Science Communication Award. Climate One guests have included then–California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Google chairman and CEO Eric Schmidt, Chair of the Nobel Prize–winning IPCC Rajendra Pachauri, and General Motors chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner.

A 2011 speaker series on social entrepreneurship, including interviews with leading social entrepreneurs, produced the book &quot;The Real Problem Solvers&quot;, by Ruth Shapiro, which was released by Stanford University Press at the end of 2012.

In 2018, the club teamed up with LGBTQ radio and TV host Michelle Meow to host her daily radio show before a live audience one day each week. Guests on &quot;The Michelle Meow Show&quot; at The Commonwealth Club have included Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza, scientist and educator Tam O&#x27;Shaughnessy (life partner of astronaut Sally Ride), Katie Sowers (the first out LGBTQ coach in the NFL), &quot;The X-Factor&quot; finalist Jason Brock, comedian Sampson McCormick, Olympic skater Adam Rippon, and others.

Because the club is strictly non-partisan and does not take positions on issues, when a project matures to the point that policy prescriptions are being considered, as in the case of Voices of Reform, the club assists the project to become a separate entity from the club itself.

<text>The Grand Junction Canal is a canal in England from Braunston in Northamptonshire to the River Thames at Brentford, with a number of branches. The mainline was built between 1793 and 1805, to improve the route from the Midlands to London, by-passing the upper reaches of the River Thames near Oxford, thus shortening the journey.

In 1927 the canal was bought by the Regent&#x27;s Canal Company and, since 1 January 1929, has formed the southern half of the Grand Union Main Line from London to Birmingham. The canal is now much used by leisure traffic.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s last major undertaking was the compact Three Bridges, London, on the canal. Work began in 1856, and was completed in 1859. The three bridges are an overlapping arrangement allowing the routes of the Grand Junction Canal, Great Western and Brentford Railway, and Windmill Lane to cross.

== History ==
=== Need ===
By 1790, an extensive network of canals was in place, or under construction, in the Midlands. However, the only route to London was via the Oxford Canal to the River Thames at Oxford, and then down the river to the capital. The river, particularly the upper reaches, was in a poor condition for navigation compared with the modern canals. The river suffered from shallow sections and shortage of water leading to delays at locks, and there were frequent conflicts with mill owners over water supplies.

In 1791–92, two surveys of a route from Brentford on the Thames to Braunston on the Oxford Canal were carried out, first by James Barnes and then by William Jessop. There were other proposals for an alternative direct route to London, and two bills were put to Parliament, but it was the bill for the Grand Junction Canal which was passed on 30 April 1793 as the Grand Junction Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 80).

=== Construction ===
The Grand Junction Canal Act 1793 authorised the company to raise up to £600,000 to fund construction of the main line from where the eastern branch of the River Brent enters the Thames adjoining Syon Park in the parish of Brentford, to the Oxford Canal at Braunston. It also authorised branches to Daventry, the River Nene at Northampton, to the turnpike road (now the A5) at Old Stratford, and to Watford: those to Daventry and Watford were not built.

William Jessop was appointed to take charge of construction which started almost immediately from both ends. On 3 June 1793 an engineer, James Barnes, was appointed at the rate of two guineas (£2 2s) per day plus half a guinea (10s 6d) expenses.
At the north end, there were problems with the construction of Blisworth Tunnel: quicksand was encountered, and errors made in alignment which meant that the tunnel had a pronounced wiggle. With the opening of Braunston Tunnel, the line was open from the Oxford Canal through to Weedon Bec in June 1796. However, Blisworth Tunnel continued to cause problems, collapsing in January 1796. The canal was opened from Braunston to Blisworth in 1797. The canal from the Thames reached Two Waters near Hemel Hempstead in 1798, Bulbourne at the north end of the Tring summit in 1799, and Stoke Bruerne at the south end of Blisworth Tunnel the following year.

Thus, with the exception of Blisworth Tunnel, the main line was fully open in 1800. To allow goods to cross the gap, a road was built in 1800 over the top of Blisworth hill and, later, upon the recommendation of committee member Joseph Wilkes, Benjamin Outram was contracted to build a tramway over the hill.

James Barnes proposed that work begin again on the tunnel on a new line. Robert Whitworth and John Rennie were called in for advice, and supported this proposal. However, construction on the new line did not start until June 1802, and was not completed until March 1805.

Initially, nine locks were used in a temporary arrangement to lower and raise the canal for the crossing of the River Great Ouse at Wolverton at the river&#x27;s water level. In 1799, William Jessop designed a three-arch masonry aqueduct and embankment to cross the river and replace the locks. This collapsed in 1808, and a wooden trough was used as a temporary replacement. It was decided to build an iron aqueduct, with Benjamin Bevan as engineer. The foundation stone for the replacement aqueduct was laid on 9 September 1809, and it was opened on 22 January 1811.

The Grand Junction Canal had reduced the distance to London from the Midlands by —via Oxford and the River Thames—and made the journey reliable. As a result, it thrived: in 1810 it carried 343,560 tons of goods through London, with roughly equal amounts into and out of the capital.

=== The branches ===
The Grand Junction&#x27;s original act, the Grand Junction Canal Act 1793 (33 Geo. 3. c. 80), authorised branches to Daventry, the River Nene at Northampton, to the turnpike road at Old Stratford (north-west of the modern Milton Keynes), and to Watford in Hertfordshire: those to Daventry and Watford were not built. The branch to Old Stratford was amended before it was built (see below). The branch to Northampton was delayed as the plans of the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal to reach Northampton and thus join with the Grand Junction came to nothing. The link to Northampton was made by a tramroad transferred from Blisworth Tunnel, with the canal from Gayton being opened in 1815. The link to Leicester was eventually achieved by the opening of the Grand Union Canal, which took a more direct route from Foxton in Leicestershire to the Grand Junction at Norton Junction.

The Grand Junction Canal Act 1794 (34 Geo. 3. c. 24) authorised three further branches, to Aylesbury, Buckingham, and Wendover. The navigable feeder from Wendover to the summit level at Tring was opened in 1799, while the Buckingham branch, an extension of the original proposal for a link to the main road at Old Stratford, was opened in 1801: both eventually fell into disuse, though the Wendover Arm is undergoing active restoration, and part of it is again navigable. The Aylesbury arm was envisaged to become a through route to the Thames and thus to the Wilts and Berks Canal and the Kennet and Avon Canal, but the 6-mile (10-kilometre) branch into the town, opened in 1815, was never extended.

The Grand Junction Canal (No. 2) Act 1795 (35 Geo. 3. c. 43) authorised a branch to Paddington from Bull&#x27;s Bridge near Hayes: this was completed in 1801 and, with its large basin at Paddington and many wharfs along its length, it became an important trade route, even more so with the subsequent opening of the Regent&#x27;s Canal. This branch also acted as a source of water from the River Brent.

The Grand Junction Canal (No. 3) Act 1795 (35 Geo. 3. c. 85) authorised a branch to St Albans: this was not built.

The last branch to be authorised and built was the route to Slough, opened in 1882.

=== Further development ===
A clause under their acts allowed the Grand Junction Canal to supply drinking water. Accordingly, the Grand Junction Waterworks Company was established in 1811, initially taking water from the River Colne, the River Brent and a reservoir in North West Middlesex now known as Ruislip Lido. These waters proved unsatisfactory and the company transferred its inlets to the River Thames.

The importance of trade between London and the Midlands meant that railway competition was an early threat to this canal compared with others in the country. John Rennie undertook a survey in 1824 for a London to Birmingham railway.

There were also ambitious proposals for new canals. In 1827 there was a proposal for a London and Birmingham Junction Canal from the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal to Braunston. In 1832, William Cubitt proposed a Central Union Canal from the Worcester and Birmingham Canal near Worcester Bar via Solihull to the Oxford at Ansty, while in 1833 there were proposals for a London and Birmingham Canal, from Stratford direct to the Regent&#x27;s Canal, which would bypass the Grand Junction Canal entirely. This, together with the railway threats, spurred the Grand Junction into making improvements.

The London and Birmingham Railway was completed in 1838 and, with the exception of the Oxford Canal, the canals on the route from London to Birmingham co-operated to reduce tolls to compete with the railway. As a result, there was an increase in traffic, but income was significantly reduced.

To cope with the traffic volumes, the locks at Stoke Bruerne were duplicated in 1835, and new larger reservoirs built at Tring to ease a serious water shortage. In 1848 the Grand Junction entered the carrying trade, pitting its boats directly against the railway competition. From 1864, steam narrow boats were acquired, working with a butty, and these penetrated as far as the Erewash Canal. Carrying was given up in 1876 because it did not pay.

By 1871 the tunnels at Braunston and Blisworth were becoming bottlenecks and steam tugs were provided to tow strings of waiting boats through.

Under the encouragement of major carriers Fellows Morton &amp; Clayton, the Grand Junction bought the (old) Grand Union Canal and the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal in 1894 and worked with other navigations to encourage more through traffic to London: the Grand Junction was concerned that through traffic was being deterred by the poor condition and high tolls of the railway-owned Cromford Canal and Nottingham Canal.

An inclined plane was opened at Foxton Locks in 1900, as part of a plan to enable wide barges to use the Grand Union Canal and thus bring more traffic on to the main line of the Grand Junction from the east Midlands. Widening of the locks at Watford was also planned, but not carried through. Consideration was given to constructing other inclined planes as part of a plan to enlarge the canals to carry 80-ton barges, but no more were built.

With ever more traffic going by rail, the canal&#x27;s only significant weapon was low tolls. While this slowed the decline in volumes, it did so only by large reductions in income, and consideration was given to amalgamations with other canals.

Concerns began to develop about the state of repair of the canal via Warwick to Birmingham, on which the Grand Junction was reliant for a through route. In 1925, discussions began with the three Warwick canals and the Regent&#x27;s Canal, and in 1926 a merger was agreed. The Regent&#x27;s Canal bought the Grand Junction Canal and the three Warwick canals, and from 1 January 1929 they became part of the (new) Grand Union Canal.

<text>Messier 89 (M89 for short, also known as NGC 4552) is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered by Charles Messier on March 18, 1781. M89 is a member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.

==Features==

Current observations allow the possibility that M89 may be nearly perfectly spherical. Distinct flattening as ellipsoids is found in all easily measurable comparators up to a few times of its distance. The alternative explanation is that it is an ellipsoid oriented so that it appears spherical to an observer on Earth.

The galaxy features a surrounding structure of gas and dust, extending up to 150,000 light-years and jets of heated particles up to two-thirds of that. This indicates that it may have once been an active quasar or radio galaxy. M89 has an extensive and complex system of surrounding shells and plumes, indicating that it has seen one or several notable mergers.

Chandra studies in the wavelength of the X-Rays show two ring-like structures of hot gas in M89&#x27;s nucleus, suggesting an outburst there 1 to 2 million years ago as well as ram-pressure stripping acting on the galaxy as it moves through Virgo&#x27;s intracluster medium. The supermassive black hole at the core has a mass of .

M89 also has a large array of globular clusters. A 2006 survey estimates that there are 2,000 ± 700 of these within 25′. This compares to 150 to 200 of these thought (among which many proven) to surround the Milky Way.

<text>Messier 90 (also known as M90 and NGC 4569) is an intermediate spiral galaxy exhibiting a weak inner ring structure about 60 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.

== Membership of the Virgo Cluster ==
Messier 90 is a member of the Virgo Cluster, being one of its largest and brightest spiral galaxies, with an absolute magnitude of around −22 (brighter than the Andromeda Galaxy). The galaxy is found about 1.5° from the central subgroup of Messier 87. Due to the galaxy&#x27;s interaction with the intracluster medium in its cluster, the galaxy has lost much of its interstellar medium. As a result of this process, which is referred to as ram-pressure stripping, the medium and star formation regions appear severely truncated compared to similar galaxies outside the Virgo Cluster and there are even H II regions outside the galactic plane, as well as long (up to 80,000-parsec—that is, 260,000-light-year) tails of ionized gas that has been stripped away.

== Star formation activity ==
As stated above, the star formation in Messier 90 appears truncated. Consequently, the galaxy&#x27;s spiral arms appear to be smooth and featureless, rather than knotted like galaxies with extended star formation, which justifies why this galaxy, along with NGC 4921 in the Coma Cluster has been classified as the prototype of an anemic galaxy. Some authors go even further and consider it is a passive spiral galaxy, similar to those found on galaxy clusters with high redshift.

However, its center appears to host significant nebula and star formation, where around 50,000 stars of spectral types O and B that formed around 5 to 6 million years ago are set amidst many A-type supergiants that were born in earlier starbursts, between 15 and 30 million years ago.

Multiple supernovae (up to 100,000) in the nucleus have produced &#x27;superwinds&#x27; that are blowing the galaxy&#x27;s interstellar medium outward into the intracluster medium collimated in two jets, one of which is being disturbed by interaction with Virgo&#x27;s intracluster medium as the galaxy moves through it.

== Blueshift ==
The spectrum of Messier 90 is blueshifted, which indicates that, net of non-aligned vectors of motion, the gap between it and our galaxy is narrowing. The spectra of most galaxies are redshifted. The blueshift was originally used to argue that Messier 90 was actually an object in the foreground of the Virgo Cluster. However, since the phenomenon was limited mostly to galaxies in the same part of the sky as the Virgo Cluster, it appeared that this inference based on the blueshift was incorrect. Instead, many blueshifts exhibit the large range in velocities of objects within the Virgo Cluster.

== Distance measurements ==
Low levels of H I gas prevents using the Tully–Fisher relation to estimate the distance to Messier 90.

== Companion galaxies ==
Messier 90 is rich in globular clusters, with around 1,000 of them. The galaxy IC 3583 was once thought to be a satellite of Messier 90; however, it is now thought they are too far away to be interacting at all.

<text>The Franz Josef Glacier (; officially Franz Josef Glacier /) is a temperate maritime glacier in Westland Tai Poutini National Park on the West Coast of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. Together with the Fox Glacier to the south, and a third glacier, it descends from the Southern Alps to less than above sea level.

The area surrounding the two glaciers is part of Te Wāhipounamu, a World Heritage Site park. The Waiho River emerges from the glacier terminal of Franz Josef.

==Naming==
The Māori name for the glacier is , literally: &#x27;The tears of Hine Hukatere&#x27;. According to oral tradition, Hine Hukatere loved climbing in the mountains and persuaded her lover Tuawe to climb with her. Tuawe was a less experienced climber than Hine Hukatere but loved to accompany her, until an avalanche swept him from the peaks to his death. Hine Hukatere was broken-hearted and her many, many tears flowed down the mountain. Rangi the Sky Father took pity on her and froze them to form the glacier.

The first European description of one of the West Coast glaciers (believed to be Franz Josef) was made in the log of the ship &quot;Mary Louisa&quot; in 1859. The glacier was later named after Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria by the German geologist Julius von Haast in 1865.

Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the glacier was officially altered to Franz Josef Glacier / .

==Geography==
The névé or snowfield at the head of Franz Josef Glacier is over above sea level and in area. This wide névé, which is over deep, feeds large amounts of compacted snow into a steep and narrow valley which drops quickly to very low altitudes: the glacier descends to above sea level in just . This combination of factors leads to Franz Josef persisting where most temperate-zone glaciers would have already melted, and allows it to share a valley with temperate rain forest.

Franz Josef Glacier currently terminates from the Tasman Sea. Near the end of the last ice age about 18,000 years ago it extended to the present-day coastline or even beyond. As it retreated the glacier left behind moraines of accumulated rock and chunks of ice which created coastal hills and lakes. Lake Wombat is a kettle lake created by ice left in a moraine 9000 years ago, while Peters Pool close to the glacier&#x27;s face arose in the same fashion just 210 years ago.

The Waiho Loop 4 km north of the settlement of Franz Josef is the terminal moraine of Franz Josef Glacier, deposited by the retreating glacier about 12,000–3,000 years ago. An arc of rubble 80 m high, it was too rugged to be cleared for farming, and remains covered in native forest.

==Advance and retreat==

Franz Josef Glacier exhibits a cyclic pattern of advance and retreat, driven by differences between the volume of meltwater at the foot of the glacier and volume of snowfall feeding the névé. Over the past 14,000 years glaciers worldwide have generally retreated. Most of New Zealand&#x27;s large glaciers shrank significantly towards the end of the 20th century, a consequence of global warming. However, in the Southern Alps warmer temperatures cause increased precipitation on the western face of the Main Divide, and Franz Josef glacier being short and steep is more sensitive to increased snow in the névé than other glaciers. If the increased precipitation falls as snow, the glacier will advance; if as rain, it will retreat. Increased snowfall takes around 5–6 years to result in changes in the terminus location.

Franz Josef Glacier advanced rapidly during the Little Ice Age, reaching a maximum in the early 18th century. When Haast became the first European to see the glacier it was still much longer than today, and the ice surface was 300 m higher. Between its first official mapping in 1893 and a century later in 1983, Franz Josef Glacier retreated 3 km up the valley.

There were several periods of advance in the 20th century – 1946 to 1951 (340 m), 1965 to 1967 (400 m), 1983 to 1999 (1420 m) and 2004 to 2008 (280 m) – but all were followed by periods of greater retreat.

This cyclic behaviour is well illustrated by a postage stamp issued in 1946, depicting the view from St James Anglican Church. The church was built in 1931, with a panoramic altar window to take advantage of its location. By 1954, the glacier had disappeared from view from the church, but it reappeared briefly in 1997.

Between 1983 and 2008 while most of the world&#x27;s glaciers were retreating many New Zealand glaciers advanced; Franz Josef regained nearly half the ice it had lost over the previous century. This anomalous growth has been attributed not to increased rainfall but to a series of cool years caused by increased southerly air flow in the Tasman sea. After 2008 the glacier entered a very rapid phase of retreat, shrinking by 1.5 km between 2008 and 2017. It is now once again 3 km shorter than it was 100 years ago. Based on these patterns, Franz Josef Glacier is predicted to retreat and lose 38% of its mass by 2100 in a mid-range scenario of warming, although it may retreat as much as .

== Floods ==
There have been some incidents of jökulhlaups (outbreak floods from water-filled ice tunnels) at the glacier. The névés of Fox and Franz Josef glaciers has one of the world&#x27;s highest precipitation levels: up to 15 m a year. In December 1965, after 280 mm of rain in two days, the Waiho River broke out of the glacier and carried chunks of ice downriver. These were still up to 50 cm across when they reached the Tasman Sea 20 km downstream. Another flood destroyed the access road bridge in 1989, followed by a further flood in April 1991. Torrential rain destroyed the bridge across the Waiho River in March 2019, and it took 18 days to replace it.

== Flora ==
Westland Tai Poutini National Park is one of the few places in New Zealand with a full sequence of pristine landscape from mountain peaks to the sea. The retreat of Franz Josef Glacier has allowed native forest to colonise the bare rock left behind, and how long ago the glacier retreated can be read in the stage of plant succession present. Some bare rock was only exposed a decade ago, while other surfaces were exposed in 1951, 1830, 1750, and 1600.

==Tourism==
Fox and Franz Josef glaciers are the most publicly-accessible glaciers in New Zealand, and among the most accessible in the world – until recently, there was easy walking access directly to the glacier termini. Consequently for over a century they have been a significant tourist attraction.

The glacier is associated with the Graham family, in particular mountaineers and guides Alec and Peter Graham and Rose Graham and historian Dorothy Fletcher (née Graham). Services in their hotel brought about the construction of St James Church.

Extract from the February 1936 issue of National Geographic Magazine:
But the Franz Josef Glacier and its background of mountains is worth waiting long to see on a clear day. It is one of the most remarkable glaciers in the world. Slipping down from a large snowfield at more than 8,000 feet, it terminates in subtropical bush, only 700 feet above sea level. Movement in its upper reaches is remarkably rapid, 15 or more feet a day.

Airplane flights have proved a popular method of seeing this eight-mile long river of bluish-green ice , pressing down among hills that are aflame in January with red flowering rata trees.

With Captain Mercer, I flew over the glacier and looked out toward the snow fields and bold Alps, and I also went with him on the initial air-mail route in New Zealand.

Today the Franz Josef glacier area is the third-most-visited tourist spot in New Zealand, and one of the main tourist attractions on the West Coast. It had around 250,000 visitors a year in 2008, increasing to 700,000 a year (500,000 overnight) in 2017. It used to be possible to walk up to the glacier, but in March 2012 the terminal face of the glacier collapsed and it is now too dangerous to approach; signs warn against crossing the safety barriers at the lookout. , the valley walk ends at a lookout about 3000 m from the main terminal face of the glacier. Visiting the glacier now requires a helicopter flight past the unstable terminal face. Glacier walks also require some specialised equipment, namely ice axes and crampons that latch onto a sturdy boot. These are usually provided by tour companies.

As the walking part of any tour up to the glacier takes a long time, and ends at the first icefall (a frozen waterfall, draping a natural step in the land underneath), many tourists book helicopter tours from one of the several local airlines, which usually drop their guests between the first and second icefalls, for a guided 1–2 hour walk through the broken ground atop the glacier. Although the glacial landscape changes almost daily, given the glacier&#x27;s unusually fast flow, and some walks including passages through ice tunnels, they are still considered quite safe and only somewhat strenuous. In June 2010, an Australian tourist died of a heart attack during a guided hike of the glacier.

An alternative option to view the glacier is via the 8-hour day hike up the high Alex Knob, overlooking the Franz Josef Glacier and valley below. The path up Alex Knob is of good tramping track standard, but strenuous due to steeply climbing about in height and considered &quot;advanced&quot; due to the duration of the hike.
At the entrance of the valley lies the village of Franz Josef, which has a permanent population of approximately 330 residents. It is situated 5 km from the glacier on and has a petrol station, small but busy heliport, numerous tourist accommodation options (with up to 2,000 people staying overnight during the main season) and a number of restaurants and shops. Just south of the village, a sealed road leads from the highway into the Franz Josef Glacier valley and to a car park. Several small walks start from the Valley Road and the car park, and it is also possible to comfortably cycle from Franz Josef township to the car park.

<text>Wanghe Bridge () is an overpass and an important nodal point in Beijing.

When it was first built it carried a railway line over the northeastern 4th Ring Road. This railway line connected to the now disused Hepingli Railway Station.

Wanghe Bridge was expanded in the early 2000s to let the CityRail (Line 13 (Beijing Subway) through. The tracks of the CityRail essentially were placed where the previous railway line used to be. Another expansion in 2002 resulted in the bridge that is seen today.

The bridge was , until September 28, 2004, the starting point of the Jingcheng Expressway towards Laiguangying and ultimately Chengde in Hebei province. The expressway now commences at Taiyanggong on the 3rd Ring Road. The expressway bridges are right over the 4th Ring Road, which runs under the bridge.

Wanghe Bridge consists of three layers. The first layer is an underpass for vehicles on the 4th Ring Road. The second layer is the Jingcheng Expressway running over the 4th Ring Road. Finally, a few flyover bridges -- connection lines -- form a more irregular third layer.

Traffic at Wanghe Bridge is usually smooth.

Wangle Bridge is labelled as Exit 1 on 4th Ring Road, because its connection with Jingcheng Expressway, which also defines Exit 1 for Taiyanggong Bridge on 3rd Ring Road, and Exit 1 for Laiguangying Bridge on 5th Ring Road.

<text>The PALM (Program All Logic in Microcode) is a 16-bit central processing unit (CPU) developed by IBM. It was used in the IBM 5100 Portable Computer, a predecessor of the IBM PC, and the IBM 5110 and IBM 5120 follow-on machines. It is likely PALM was also used in other IBM products as an embedded controller.

IBM referred to PALM as a &quot;microprocessor&quot;, though they used that term to mean a processor that executes microcode to implement a higher-level instruction set, rather than its conventional definition of a CPU on an integrated circuit. The PALM processor was a circuit board containing 13 bipolar gate arrays packaged in square metal cans, 3 conventional transistor–transistor logic (TTL) ICs in dual in-line packages, and 1 round metal can part.

The PALM was used to implement an emulator, which in turn could run machine instructions originally written for other machines; this is how IBM System/360 APL ran on the &quot;5100&quot;.

PALM has a 16-bit data bus, with two additional bits used for parity. PALM can directly address 64KB (64KiB) of memory. The IBM 5100 could be configured with up to 64+KB (APL + BASIC ROMs make 64+KB) of &quot;Executable ROS&quot; (ROM) and up to 64KB of RAM. A simple bank switching scheme was used to extend the address space.

In 1973, the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on the PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive, small CRT display, and full-function keyboard.

<text>John Michael Safran (; born 13 August 1972) is an Australian radio personality, satirist, documentary maker and author, known for combining humour with religious, political and ethnic issues. First gaining fame appearing in &quot;Race Around the World&quot; in 1997, Safran went on to produce a series of documentaries, television shows and host radio programs.

Safran is known for his television stunts, which include placing a fatwa on Australian television host Rove McManus, sneaking nine young men into an exclusive Melbourne nightclub by disguising them as members of American nu metal band Slipknot, running through Jerusalem wearing nothing but the beanie and scarf of St Kilda Football Club, driving a remote-controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and his confrontation with &quot;A Current Affair&quot; host Ray Martin.

He currently works as a journalist and author. He released his latest book, &quot;Squat&quot;, in October 2024.

==Early life==
Safran was born in Melbourne to Jewish parents. His maternal grandparents were Polish Jewish Bundists. Safran&#x27;s mother, Gitl, was born in Uzbekistan as they were fleeing their home country for Australia. She died in 2003. His paternal ancestors were German Jews and left shortly before the rise of Nazi Germany. He has one older sister, Margaret.

He grew up in Balwyn North and attended North Balwyn Primary School, Balwyn High School and Yeshivah College from Year 8 onwards. He describes himself at Yeshivah, an all-boys Orthodox Jewish school, as being &quot;the least religious kid in the most religious school in Australia&quot;.

After school he studied journalism at RMIT University. He eventually dropped out without completing his degree and began work in advertising for Clemenger Harvie. During this time he also worked as a copywriter for Mazda, Village Roadshow and Sea World, where he wrote the company&#x27;s jingle.
During his final year in high school, Safran formed the hip-hop group Raspberry Cordial with his friend Chris Lumsden. They played to some success, receiving high rotation airplay on the city&#x27;s community radio, playing many gigs in Melbourne and coming second in the RMIT Battle of the Bands competition.

After winning a government youth music initiative, they followed up with &quot;Taste Test&quot;, of which 500 copies were pressed. Of those only 93 sold, so the remaining 407 had to be crushed. He said that the world just &quot;wasn&#x27;t ready for white rappers then&quot; and Raspberry Cordial &quot;broke down the wall that Eminem&#x27;s been able to walk through&quot;, referencing the well-known Caucasian rapper Eminem and his success in an industry predominantly African-American.

==Career==
===1997–1998: &quot;Race Around the World&quot;===

Safran&#x27;s first experience of national fame came via &quot;Race Around the World&quot;, a television competition for young documentarians run by the ABC. In his audition tape, Safran was required to submit ten seconds of black, but instead he submitted ten seconds of Black Sabbath.

Safran started the race off timid and tame, being locked inside an Osaka subway station in his first entry. However, he quickly broke what he called the &quot;fear barrier&quot; to film his now famous segments. He ran streaking naked through the streets of Jerusalem wearing only the scarf and beanie of his favourite football club, St Kilda, to prove that God is Jewish (St Kilda&#x27;s only Grand Final win fell on the same day as Yom Kippur). He was baptised and placed a Voodoo curse on his ex-girlfriend in the Ivory Coast. He sneaked into Disneyland via a work area and attached information plaques he made about founder Walt Disney to a display (highlighting little-known Disney &quot;facts&quot; such as Walt Disney&#x27;s alleged early support for Adolf Hitler) and got a Catholic priest to review death metal music.

Safran&#x27;s segments scored well with both the judges and the public audience, Safran topped the viewer poll. He was, however, disqualified for a segment taped in a confessional booth (the program forbade hidden camera footage); the disqualification of the segment and subsequent loss of points meant that he finished last in the first season of &quot;Race Around the World&quot;.

===1998–2002: After &quot;The Race&quot;===
After this brush with fame, the ABC commissioned two 30-minute TV pilots from Safran.

One pilot called &quot;John Safran: Media Tycoon&quot; focused on the media industry, airing in 1998. It became famous for a segment involving Ray Martin, then host of tabloid current affairs TV show &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, where Safran harassed him in the style characteristic of &quot;A Current Affair&quot; by sorting through his bin, which was later satirised by comedian Shaun Micallef. Martin had set up members of the Paxton family. Safran and one of the victims, Shane Paxton, turned up to Martin&#x27;s home. Martin and his wife Dianne physically threatened Safran. Martin&#x27;s wife ripped apart Safran&#x27;s papier mâché hat and Ray grabbed Safran by the collar, prompting Shane Paxton to intervene. Martin was in contact with the ABC and specifically warned Safran in the segment that he had spoken to Roger Grant, who was then Head of Corporate Affairs at the ABC. Martin&#x27;s connection with this executive at the ABC is suspected to be a reason the series never made it to air. The Ray Martin segment was later played on &quot;Media Watch&quot;, &quot;John Safran: The Lost Pilot&quot; and on YouTube. In 2014, Martin still appeared bitter about the incident, calling Safran a &quot;serial pest&quot;.

The second pilot was titled &quot;John Safran: Master Chef&quot;. This pilot focused on the food industry. Notably, it featured a cooking segment where Safran prepared a beef dish. The twist comes when he arrives at an abattoir and shows detailed footage of cows being slaughtered to complete the dish. Though all unsuccessful, the pilots became hits via the Internet among university students. Safran also recorded a parody of Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s song &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Free (To Wear Sunscreen)&quot; entitled &quot;Not the Sunscreen Song&quot;, which includes lines such as &quot;Never live in Adelaide, it&#x27;s a hole&quot; and &quot;Remember, you can&#x27;t get pregnant the first time you have sex&quot;. It peaked at No. 20 in 1998 and was nominated for an ARIA. In Triple M&#x27;s &quot;2005 Greatest Songs Ever Written and Performed Since the Beginning of Time&quot; poll, &quot;Not the Sunscreen Song&quot; came in at #706 – one spot above &quot;Superstition&quot; by Stevie Wonder.

Safran also presented segments for the Seven Network&#x27;s now defunct &quot;The Late Report&quot;, some were also screened in the United Kingdom with Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Disinformation&quot; program. Safran attained police attention for a stunt to try and coerce cricketer Shane Warne into breaking a &quot;no smoking&quot; clause in an advertising contract with a nicotine gum manufacturer. Safran drove a remote controlled seagull with a cigarette onto the MCG pitch during a match. He was arrested for &quot;pitch invasion&quot;, but the charges were dropped.

===2002–2003: &quot;Music Jamboree&quot;===

In 2002, Safran launched his documentary series &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot;. On one occasion Safran and his crew stormed the courtyard of his former school and amid shocked religious students and teachers, he and his crew began to dance to the song &quot;Footloose&quot;. He was also able to gain entry into an exclusive Melbourne night club by dressing up nine men as the band Slipknot. Screened on SBS on Saturday nights, it opened Safran&#x27;s work to youth 12 to 20 years old, who had not seen the original &quot;Race Around the World&quot; material. The show won the AFI award in 2003 for &quot;Best Comedy Series&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;John Safran vs God&quot;===

In August 2004 he debuted his new show &quot;John Safran vs God&quot;, also on the SBS television network. The first seven episodes were typical Safran informative satire. The series&#x27; finale featured Safran being exorcised of demons which had supposedly possessed him during his dabblings with world religions. The exorcism was performed by well-known Christian fundamentalist Bob Larson. In an interview with an Australian radio personality, Safran said that he &quot;felt something was going on&quot;, and that &quot;there was something about the expression on my face&quot;. In an interview on Andrew Denton&#x27;s &quot;Enough Rope&quot; program, he claimed that he had no memory of the events during the exorcism, and stated that the footage shown on the show was merely the most interesting from hours of footage. &quot;John Safran vs God&quot; won a 2005 AFI Award for &quot;Best Comedy Series&quot;.

Before the exorcism, Safran went to Mozambique to have a curse, previously placed on the Australian national football team by a now-deceased witch doctor, lifted. He and former Australian football team captain Johnny Warren were covered in chicken&#x27;s blood in the process. Subsequently, on 16 November 2005, Australia qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1974.

===2005: &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;===

In 2005 and 2006, Safran co-hosted a television talk show entitled &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot; with Father Bob Maguire, a Catholic priest who was featured in &quot;John Safran vs God&quot;. The 12-part series broadcast on SBS Television and began on 7 November 2005.

===2007–2010: &quot;Race Relations&quot;===

Safran spent portions of 2007 in Los Angeles shooting a pilot entitled &quot;John Safran Saves America&quot; for American MTV in which he tried to convince emos to fight in Iraq, visited therapists who claim they can cure people of racism, and attempted to become gay to increase his standing in Hollywood. Safran stated in an interview that he had not heard back from the production company Reveille Productions whether the program has been purchased for production or not but as time went by, &quot;the answer isn&#x27;t getting any yesser&quot;.

In 2009 &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Race Relations&quot;, an eight-part comedy documentary television series, was picked up by the ABC. As part of this series, on 10 April 2009, John Safran took part in a devotional crucifixion, an annual event occurring on Good Friday in the Philippines. Safran was crucified in Barangay Kapitangan, Paombong, Bulacan, just outside Manila along with three other men and one woman. He had nails driven through his hands and feet and hung on the cross for five minutes before being taken down and given medical treatment in a nearby tent set up for the purpose. It was nominated for a 2010 Logie Award in the category of Light Entertainment.

==Radio presenter and &quot;Sunday Night Safran&quot;==

, Safran had been a regular host of Melbourne community radio station 3RRR (Triple R) on its morning show &quot;Breakfasters&quot;. Additionally, he co-hosted the weekly radio show &quot;Sunday Night Safran&quot; on national youth radio station Triple J with Father Bob Maguire. After a lengthy hiatus late 2008 due to a busy filming schedule, &quot;Sunday Night Safran&quot; returned to the airwaves on 12 July 2009. The program ended at the end of 2015.

The program was iconic because the co-hosts talked to each other for much longer than instructed to (one such incident involved Fr Bob and Safran looking up the word &quot;monstrance&quot; in a dictionary following a dispute) and referring to the audience as &quot;Dear Listeners&quot;. By Safran&#x27;s own admission, Maguire and he &quot;only seem to talk about Scrabble and White Supremacists&quot;.

During the program&#x27;s run, Safran and Maguire were able to get interviews from people such as religious scholar Reza Aslan, Julian Assange&#x27;s mother Christine, &quot;The Exorcist&quot; star Linda Blair, philosopher and School of Life founder Alain de Botton, writer, retired prison doctor and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple, West Memphis Three Damien Echols, antitheist Christopher Hitchens, conspiracy theorist David Icke, former white supremacist skinhead Frank Meeink, pro-euthanasia doctor Philip Nitschke, &quot;The Act of Killing&quot; director Joshua Oppenheimer, journalist and writer Jon Ronson, true crime writer and Ted Bundy co-worker Ann Rule, the Lizardman Erik Sprague, African-American pro-Israel political activist and Zionist Chloé Valdary, Jewish activist against child sexual abuse Manny Waks, psychic Lisa Williams and John Safran&#x27;s dad, Alex.

==Non-fiction writing and journalism==
After discovering that a subject of his series &quot;Race Relations&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&#x27;s most notorious white supremacist&quot; Richard Barrett had been murdered, Safran returned to Mississippi to cover the trial. In 2013 Penguin Books published Safran&#x27;s memoir of his experiences on this trip, &quot;Murder in Mississippi&quot; (published as &quot;God&#x27;ll Cut You Down&quot; in the US). In 2014 he received a Ned Kelly Award for Best True Crime for the book. Safran writes for a number of newspapers, including the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and Vice News.

Safran has also written a book about extremism in Australia, titled &quot;Depends What You Mean By Extremist&quot;. It was published in May 2017.

His investigation into Big Tobacco, &quot;Puff Piece&quot; was published in August 2021. It was shortlisted for the 2022 Prime Minister&#x27;s Literary Award for Nonfiction. 

His book &quot;Squat&quot;, released in October 2024, describes his experience squatting in a Los Angeles mansion owned by Kanye West. 

==Personal life==
Safran&#x27;s favourite board game is &quot;Scrabble&quot;. However, he prefers to play one-on-one compared with four or more players, as he considers that a one-on-one game is a &quot;game of skill&quot; instead of a &quot;game of luck&quot;. He also owns all the comprehensive Scrabble dictionaries. Furthermore, Safran has a &quot;Scrabble&quot; Rug, a &quot;Scrabble&quot; board costume, &quot;Michael Groves Special Edition Scrabble&quot;, Hebrew &quot;Scrabble&quot;, CD-Rom &quot;Scrabble&quot;, Keyring &quot;Scrabble&quot; and a &quot;Scrabble&quot; watch.

John Safran was painted by Yvette Coppersmith and entered in the 2009 Archibald Prize. The painting was a finalist. A portrait by Avraham Vofsi titled &quot;John Safran as David and Goliath&quot; was a finalist in the 2022 Archibald Prize.

Safran has stated that he believes in a force or unifying spirit, and has some &quot;supernatural beliefs&quot;. He went on to explain that he doesn&#x27;t think &quot;these things have to be absolutely true to sort of be invigorating&quot;. Furthermore, he thinks mysticism is &quot;a bit like trying to see how long you can hold your breath underwater or like driving without a seatbelt and it’s just like it’s fun. Like so basically religion is a bit like – trying to ban religion is like trying to ban snowboarding or something. It’s just like the rituals are just – can be really fun&quot;. He thinks that organised religion &quot;gets a pretty good break in Australia&quot;, as they don&#x27;t have to pay as much tax and are allowed to preach against homosexuals.

Safran publicly stated that religious education should be allowed in schools, and disagrees that it is manipulation. 
It’s like saying if you’re going to listen to heavy metal albums you’re going to go on shooting sprees. It’s not like having a chaplain in your school like it’s the only influence that’s going to be on the kid. [...] You’re just going to jump into strange people, so you bump into the chaplain and he’s teaching you all that strange stuff and then, I don’t know, you grow up and then you’ve got these cool stories about the mad chaplain at your school.

Safran&#x27;s first date was with a girl called Meg whom he was doing work experience with at the &quot;Australian Jewish News&quot; in Year 10. They saw &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; together. At university he began a relationship with a Bolivian girl, but it ended because Safran was &quot;obsessed with [his] creative work&quot;, and at 19 Safran did not want the relationship to turn into something more serious.

Safran dated playwright Lally Katz.

<doc id="968198" wikidata="Q259691" url="?curid=968198" title="Jay Kay">
<text>Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Kay (born Jason Luís Cheetham, 30 December 1969) is a British singer and songwriter. In 1992, he co-founded the acid jazz and funk band Jamiroquai and still serves as their lead vocalist. As of 2017, the band had sold more than 26 million albums worldwide.

Outside music, Kay is known for his interest in luxury cars, and made appearances in the shows &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Fifth Gear&quot;. He has also contributed to environmental causes. Kay previously had a high-profile relationship with Denise van Outen.

== Early life ==
Jay Kay was born Jason Luís Cheetham in Stretford, Lancashire, on 30 December 1969, to English cabaret singer Karen Kay and Portuguese guitarist Luís Saraiva. His parents split up, and he did not meet his biological father until he was about 28. Kay&#x27;s identical twin, David, died of brain damage a few weeks after the two were born. Kay said in a 2010 interview that his mother raised him largely alone, and being that she was a cabaret singer, he had &quot;an itinerant childhood&quot;, half of which he spent &quot;living in rural Suffolk&quot;.Kay attended several boarding schools throughout his childhood, including in Devon. He often accompanied his mother at her performances. He and his mother would often travel to Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. where she would perform. He was babysat by several cabaret members. He moved back to Manchester with his mother and step-father Mervyn Kay after briefly living in Blackburn as a youngster. When he was 13, he and his family moved to West Ealing, London. He moved out at the age of 16. At the age of 15, he was homeless and turned to small crimes to survive; he returned home after a false arrest and near-death experience, working as a break-dancer and soon pursuing a career in music. It had been reported that he failed an audition to become a singer for the Brand New Heavies prior to forming his own band, though the Brand New Heavies denied the claim.

==Career==
=== Jamiroquai ===
Kay formed Jamiroquai in 1992. Band members included Toby Smith (keyboards), Nick Van Gelder (drums, 1992–1993), Derrick McKenzie (drums 1994–present) and Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo). After the success of Jamiroquai&#x27;s first single, &quot;When You Gonna Learn&quot;, Kay signed a US$1 million record deal with Sony Soho2. The band&#x27;s first album was &quot;Emergency on Planet Earth&quot;. The relationship with Sony ended in 2007. The band has sold more than 26 million albums worldwide. Kay is occasionally referred to as &#x27;Jamiroquai&#x27; due to the misconception that the band is a solo artist.

Kay is well known for his array of elaborate hats and headgear. Professional appearances for concerts, interviews and the like have prompted descriptions of Kay as &quot;the mad hatter&quot; for his love of headgear. In 2005, it was announced that Kay, often referred to as &quot;the cat in the hat&quot;, was launching a range of distinctive clothing, including his trademark hats, on his new &quot;Quai&quot; label. The Indian Country Media Network criticised him for wearing headdresses originating from Native American populations, including the feathered war bonnet (as seen in the music video and CD single artwork for &quot;Corner of the Earth&quot; as well as on the album artwork for 2010&#x27;s &quot;Rock Dust Light Star&quot;).

On 9 October 2017, Kay received the BMI President&#x27;s Award at the BMI London Awards. That same year, he seriously injured his spine. Requiring surgery, it led to Jamiroquai cancelling two shows in Tokyo for their Automaton Tour, which were rescheduled later that year.

===TV appearances===

Kay appeared in an episode of the BBC series &quot;The Naked Chef&quot; with chef Jamie Oliver, and he performed on the series &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; singing &quot;Canned Heat&quot;. 
He has made many other TV guest appearances as either a singer, interviewee, or both, including on &quot;The Word&quot;, &quot;The Girlie Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, &quot;Rove&quot;, and many others. 

Kay has appeared on four episodes of the BBC car show &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In series 1, episode 2, he set a lap time of 1:48.1 for the show&#x27;s &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; using the Suzuki Liana, holding the fastest lap time for all of the first series and most of the second series. In series 3, episode 4, Kay drove his Lamborghini Miura with Richard Hammond as a passenger. His third appearance was in series 11, episode 6, where his lap time of 1:45.81 using the Chevrolet Lacetti beat the top time held by Simon Cowell by one-tenth of a second; this car&#x27;s record remained unbeaten throughout the entire series&#x27; run despite there being 58 drivers in total for the Chevrolet Lacetti, with AC/DC&#x27;s Brian Johnson coming in second place for this car with 1:45.85. Kay won &quot;Top Gear&#x27;s&quot; &quot;John Sergeant Award&quot; for the best dance after learning that his time on the &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track was the fastest lap time in 2008. On 24 May 2004, Kay appeared on Season 5, Episode 9 of Channel 5 series &quot;Fifth Gear&quot;. He gave the presenters a tour around his property whilst showing off his collection of cars.

==Legal issues==
In April 2001, Kay was charged with assaulting a photographer and damaging his camera outside the Attica nightclub in London&#x27;s West End. Kay pleaded not guilty, and the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence.

In May 2002, Kay was questioned by police after an altercation at a premiere party for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, outside the St Martin&#x27;s Lane Hotel, where it was alleged a photographer kicked his £70,000 Bentley after Kay had attempted to grab him as his car drove off. Kay harangued the photographer and his girlfriend, causing the man to give him a severe headbutt to the nose. The pair were separated with blood streaming from Kay&#x27;s shattered nose. The fight almost resumed inside the hotel, and Kay was photographed in a distressed state. He sported a black eye at his next gig. He was also reported to have got into a scuffle at an afterparty for the 2002 BRIT Awards.

In September 2006, he was arrested outside a nightclub in West End, London for allegedly assaulting a photographer and damaging his camera. He was alleged to have acted erratically and was taken to Saville Police Station.
In March 2009, Kay&#x27;s black Ferrari Enzo suffered nearly £10,000 worth of damage during an altercation with hotel chef Aaron Billington at the Brudenell Hotel in Aldeburgh. Billington, who was drunk and motivated by romantic interest in a woman with whom Kay was interacting, lost his job and was jailed for 20 weeks.

==Cars==

By 2013, Kay owned hundreds of cars—mainly sports cars. The cover of &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot; features an adaptation of the &quot;Buffalo Man&quot; logo and the Ferrari crest. Some press coverage has negatively contrasted his strong interest in luxury cars with themes of environmental concern in Jamiroquai&#x27;s lyrics. He responded in one interview, &quot;[People] keep talking to me about cars and environment, and I reckon I do about 3,000 miles a year [...] I don&#x27;t really drive that much at all any more, because I&#x27;m either on tour or doing stuff.&quot; He has also quipped that he &quot;can only drive one at a time&quot;. 
Three of Kay&#x27;s cars appeared in the video for the song &quot;Cosmic Girl&quot;. One of the cars was a total loss, and the replacement was involved in an incident that destroyed the windscreen. Kay was not involved in either incident. In 2011, he visited Maranello for an exclusive viewing of the new Ferrari 458 Spider. Amongst his car collection, including what he calls &quot;staff cars&quot;, he owned a one-off 1965 Ferrari 330 GT Vignale Shooting Brake. He decided to auction this car in 2018, selling it for $313,000.

The song &quot;Black Devil Car&quot; from the album &quot;Dynamite&quot; is a tribute to his black Ferrari Enzo. A die-cast 1:18 scale-model series of Kay&#x27;s black Enzo from Hot Wheels was available for purchase, including a limited batch of cars with hand-signed windscreens.

Kay competed in the Celebrity Challenge race at the 2012 Silverstone Classic, finishing third behind AC/DC vocalist Brian Johnson and actor Kelvin Fletcher.

At the 2014 Goodwood Festival of Speed, Kay showcased his signal green LaFerrari, the only one of its colour in the world. He sold the car in 2019.

==Personal life==

From 1998 until 2001 Kay was in a relationship with Denise van Outen. 

Kay is married to Maria Kay, and they have two daughters, Carla and Tallulah. The track &quot;Carla&quot; from the &quot;Automaton&quot; album is a tribute to his first daughter. There is also a track called &quot;Talullah&quot; from Jamiroquai&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Dynamite&quot;, although the spelling on the album is different to his daughter&#x27;s name.

Kay stated in 2010 that he had a &quot;substantial&quot; cocaine habit before quitting his drug use in 2003, said to have been triggered over his break-up with Denise van Outen.

Kay formerly lived in the Ealing area of London, where he played some of his first gigs. Since 1995 he has owned Horsenden Manor at Horsenden, near Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire where he has a recording studio, granary and garages. In 2020 he applied to extend the property. In another interview, he talked about how he has made his home environmentally sustainable, including tending to his own garden without pesticides, caring for livestock, creating an eco-friendly waste-removal system at great cost, and maximising his recycling. Kay and the band also put aside a significant portion of their royalties to environmental causes. He also owned a property in Gairloch, Wester Ross, Scotland until selling it in 2022.

When asked in a 1996 interview about having conventional religious beliefs, Kay responded, &quot;I follow the religion of the trees and the greenery. I follow the religion of the moon. I believe in what people leave behind in the sense of trails and spirits, the energy which they project. I believe in vibrations, which is what the whole world runs on.&quot;

<text>Dog intelligence or dog cognition is the process in dogs of acquiring information and conceptual skills, and storing them in memory, retrieving, combining and comparing them, and using them in new situations.

Dogs have about twice the number of neurons in their cerebral cortexes than what cats have, which suggests they could be about twice as intelligent. 

Studies have shown that dogs display many behaviors associated with intelligence. They have advanced memory skills, and are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception, and self-awareness by detecting their own smell during the &quot;sniff test&quot;, a proposed olfactory equivalent to the mirror test.

== Evolutionary perspective ==
Dogs have often been used in studies of cognition, including research on perception, awareness, memory, and learning, notably research on classical and operant conditioning. In the course of this research, behavioral scientists uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog, abilities that are neither possessed by dogs&#x27; closest canine relatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes. Rather, these skills resemble some of the social-cognitive skills of human children. This may be an example of convergent evolution, which happens when distantly related species independently evolve similar solutions to the same problems. For example, fish, penguins and dolphins have each separately evolved flippers as solution to the problem of moving through the water. With dogs and humans, we may see psychological convergence; that is, dogs have evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans than we are to our closest genetic relatives.

However, it is questionable whether the cognitive evolution of humans and animals may be called &quot;independent&quot;. The cognitive capacities of dogs have inevitably been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, many dogs readily respond to social cues common to humans, quickly learn the meaning of words, show cognitive bias and exhibit emotions that seem to reflect those of humans.

Research suggests that domestic dogs may have lost some of their original cognitive abilities once they joined humans. For example, one study showed compelling evidence that dingoes &quot;(Canis dingo)&quot; can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving experiments. Another study indicated that after being trained to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at a nearby human, while socialized wolves do not. Thus, modern domestic dogs seem to use humans to solve some of their problems for them.

In 2014, a whole genome study of the DNA differences between wolves and dogs found that dogs did not show a reduced fear response; they showed greater synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the cellular correlate of learning and memory, and this change may have altered the learning and memory abilities of dogs.

Most modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes in developed countries, a small fraction of the dog population. Dogs from other populations may show different cognitive behaviors. Breed differences possibly could impact on spatial learning and memory abilities.

== Studies history ==
The first intelligence test for dogs was developed in 1976. It included measurements of short-term memory, agility, and ability to solve problems such as detouring to a goal. It also assessed the ability of a dog to adapt to new conditions and cope with emotionally difficult situations. The test was administered to 100 dogs and standardized, and breed norms were developed. Stanley Coren used surveys done by dog obedience judges to rank dog breeds by intelligence and published the results in his 1994 book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;.

== Perception ==

Perception refers to mental processes through which incoming sensory information is organized and interpreted in order to represent and understand the environment. Perception includes such processes as the selection of information through attention, the organization of sensory information through grouping, and the identification of events and objects. In the dog, olfactory information (the sense of smell) is particularly salient (compared with humans) but the dog&#x27;s senses also include vision, hearing, taste, touch and proprioception. There is also evidence that dogs sense the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

One researcher has proposed that dogs perceive the passing of time through the dissipation of smells.

== Awareness ==
The concept of object permanence is the ability of an animal to understand that objects continue to exist even when they have moved outside of their field of view. This ability is not present at birth, and developmental psychologist Jean Piaget described six stages in the development of object permanence in human infants. A similar approach has been used with dogs, and there is evidence that dogs go through similar stages and reach the advanced fifth stage by an age of 8 weeks. At this stage they can track &quot;successive visible displacement&quot; in which the experimenter moves the object behind multiple screens before leaving it behind the last one. It is unclear whether dogs reach Stage 6 of Piaget&#x27;s object permanence development model.

A study in 2013 indicated that dogs appear to recognize other dogs regardless of breed, size, or shape, and distinguish them from other animals.

In 2014, a study using magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that voice-response areas exist in the brains of dogs and that they show a response pattern in the anterior temporal voice areas that is similar to that in humans.

Dogs can pass the &quot;sniff test&quot; suggesting potential self-awareness in the olfactory sense, and also show awareness of the size and movement of their bodies.

== Social cognition ==

=== Social learning: observation and rank ===

Dogs are capable of learning through simple reinforcement (e.g., classical or operant conditioning), but they also learn by watching humans and other dogs.

One study investigated whether dogs engaged in partnered play would adjust their behavior to the attention-state of their partner. The experimenters observed that play signals were only sent when the dog was holding the attention of its partner. If the partner was distracted, the dog instead engaged in attention-getting behavior before sending a play signal.

Puppies learn behaviors quickly by following examples set by experienced dogs. This form of intelligence is not particular to those tasks dogs have been bred to perform, but can be generalized to various abstract problems. For example, Dachshund puppies were set the problem of pulling a cart by tugging on an attached piece of ribbon in order to get a reward from inside the cart. Puppies that watched an experienced dog perform this task learned the task fifteen times faster than those left to solve the problem on their own.

The social rank of dogs affects their performance in social learning situations. In social groups with a clear hierarchy, dominant individuals are the more influential demonstrators and the knowledge transfer tends to be unidirectional, from higher rank to lower. In a problem-solving experiment, dominant dogs generally performed better than subordinates when they observed a human demonstrator&#x27;s actions, a finding that reflects the dominance of the human in dog-human groups. Subordinate dogs learn best from the dominant dog that is adjacent in the hierarchy.

=== Following human cues ===

Dogs show human-like social cognition in various ways. For example, dogs can react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and they also understand human voice commands. In one study, puppies were presented with a box, and shown that, when a handler pressed a lever, a ball would roll out of the box. The handler then allowed the puppy to play with the ball, making it an intrinsic reward. The pups were then allowed to interact with the box. Roughly three quarters of the puppies subsequently touched the lever, and over half successfully released the ball, compared to only 6% in a control group that did not watch the human manipulate the lever.

Similarly, dogs may be guided by cues indicating the direction of a human&#x27;s attention. In one task a reward was hidden under one of two buckets. The experimenter then indicated the location of the reward by tapping the bucket, pointing to the bucket, nodding at the bucket, or simply looking at the bucket. The dogs followed these signals, performing better than chimpanzees, wolves, and human infants at this task; even puppies with limited exposure to humans performed well.

Dogs can follow the direction of pointing by humans. New Guinea singing dogs are a half-wild proto-dog endemic to the remote alpine regions of New Guinea and these can follow human pointing as can Australian dingoes. These both demonstrate an ability to read human gestures that arose early in domestication without human selection. Dogs and wolves have also been shown to follow more complex pointing made with body parts other than the human arm and hand (e.g. elbow, knee, foot). Dogs tend to follow hand/arm pointed directions more when combined with eye signaling as well. In general, dogs seem to use human cues as an indication on where to go and what to do. Overall, dogs appear to have several cognitive skills necessary to understand communication as information; however, findings on dogs&#x27; understanding of referentiality and others&#x27; mental states are controversial and it is not clear whether dog themselves communicate with informative motives.

For canines to perform well on traditional human-guided tasks (e.g. following the human point) both relevant lifetime experiences with humans—including socialization to humans during the critical phase for social development—and opportunities to associate human body parts with certain outcomes (such as food being provided by humans, a human throwing or kicking a ball, etc.) are required.

In 2016, a study of water rescue dogs that respond to words or gestures found that the dogs would respond to the gesture rather than the verbal command.

== Memory ==

=== Episodic memory ===
Dogs have demonstrated episodic-like memory by recalling past events that included the complex actions of humans. In a 2019 study, a correlation has been shown between the size of the dog and the functions of memory and self-control, with larger dogs performing significantly better than smaller dogs in these functions. However, in the study brain size did not predict a dog&#x27;s ability to follow human pointing gestures, nor was it associated with their inferential and physical reasoning abilities. A 2018 study on canine cognitive abilities found that various animals, including pigs, pigeons and chimpanzees, are able to remember the what, where and when of an event, which dogs cannot do.

=== Learning and using words ===
Various studies have shown that dogs readily learn the names of objects and can retrieve an item from among many others when given its name. For example, in 2008, Betsy, a Border Collie, knew over 345 words by the retrieval test, and she was also able to connect an object with a photographic image of the object, despite having seen neither before. In another study, a dog watched as experimenters handed an object back and forth to each other while using the object&#x27;s name in a sentence. The dog subsequently retrieved the item given its name.

In humans, &quot;fast mapping&quot; is the ability to form quick and rough hypotheses about the meaning of a new word after only a single exposure. In 2004, a study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed he was able to fast map. Rico initially knew the labels of over 200 items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion, that is, by knowing that the novel item was the one that he did not already know. Rico correctly retrieved such novel items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. Rico was also able to interpret phrases such as &quot;fetch the sock&quot; by its component words (rather than considering its utterance to be a single word). Rico could also give the sock to a specified person. This performance is comparable to that of 3-year-old humans.

In 2013, a study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a Border Collie, &quot;Chaser&quot;, who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words at the time of its publishing. Chaser was documented as capable of learning the names of new objects &quot;by exclusion&quot;, and capable of linking nouns to verbs. It is argued that central to the understanding of the Border Collie&#x27;s remarkable accomplishments is the dog&#x27;s breeding background—collies bred for herding work are uniquely suited for intellectual tasks like word association which may require the dog to work &quot;at a distance&quot; from their human companions, and the study credits this dog&#x27;s selective breeding in addition to rigorous training for her intellectual prowess.

Some research has suggested that while dogs can easily make a distinction between familiar known words and nonsensical dissimilar words, they struggle to differentiate between known familiar words and nonsense words that differ by only a single sound, as measurements of the dogs&#x27; brain activity showed no difference in response between a known word and a similar but nonsensical word. This would give dogs the word processing capability equivalent to the average 14-month human infant. An fMRI study found that the dog brain distinguished, without training, a familiar from an unfamiliar language. The study also found that older dogs were better at discriminating one language from the other, suggesting an effect of the amount of exposition to the language.

== Emotions ==

Studies suggest that dogs feel complex emotions, like jealousy and anticipation. However, behavioral evidence of seemingly human emotions must be interpreted with care. For example, in his 1996 book &quot;Good Natured&quot;, ethologist Frans de Waal discusses an experiment on guilt and reprimands conducted on a female Siberian Husky. The dog had the habit of shredding newspapers, and when her owner returned home to find the shredded papers and scold her she would act guilty. However, when the owner himself shredded the papers without the dog&#x27;s knowledge, the dog &quot;acted just as &#x27;guilty&#x27; as when she herself had created the mess.&quot; De Waal concludes that the dog did not display true guilt as humans understand it, but rather simply the anticipation of reprimand.

One limitation in the study of emotions in non-human animals, is that they cannot verbalize to express their feelings. However, dogs&#x27; emotions can be studied indirectly through cognitive tests, called cognitive bias test, which measure a cognitive bias and allow to make inference about the mood of the animal. Researchers have found that dogs suffering from separation anxiety have a more negative cognitive bias, compared to dogs without separation anxiety. On the other hand, when dogs&#x27; separation anxiety is treated with medications and behavior therapy, their cognitive bias becomes less negative than before treatment. Also administration of oxytocin, rather than a placebo, induces a more positive cognitive bias and positive expectation in dogs. It is therefore suggested that the cognitive bias test can be used to monitor positive emotional states and therefore welfare in dogs.

There is evidence that dogs can discriminate the emotional expressions of human faces. In addition, they seem to respond to faces in somewhat the same way as humans. For example, humans tend to gaze at the right side of a person&#x27;s face, which may be related to the use of right brain hemisphere for facial recognition. Research indicates that dogs also fixate the right side of a human face, but not that of other dogs or other animals. Dogs are the only non-primate species known to do so.

== Problem solving ==
Dogs learned to activate a robot to deliver them food rewards.

Dogs have been observed to learn to use public transport to arrive at a desired destination. In Moscow out of 500 dogs, 20 learned to commute. Eclipse, a black labrador in Seattle, would occasionally ride the bus ahead of its owner when eager to get to the dog park. Ratty, a Jack Russell terrier in Yorkshire, England, traveled by bus to be fed at two pubs.

Captive-raised dingoes (&quot;Canis dingo&quot;) can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving. Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, whereas socialized wolves do not. Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them. Sex-specific dynamics are an important contributor to individual differences in cognitive performance of pet dogs in repeated problem-solving tasks.

== Learning by inference ==
Dogs have been shown to learn by making inferences in a similar way to children.Dogs have the ability to train themselves and learn behaviors through watching and interacting with other dogs. In one study dogs were first introduced to a setting with two bowls, one with a reward. After four demonstrations to show dogs there was at least one reward in one of the bowls, the empty bowl was lifted and shown then, laid down, 33% of dogs correctly picked the reward bowl more often than the empty bowl.

== Theory of mind ==

Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, pretending, knowledge, etc.—to oneself and others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one&#x27;s own. There is some evidence that dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. For example, one observer reported that a dog hid a stolen treat by sitting on it until the rightful owner of the treat left the room. Although this could have been accidental, it suggests that the thief understood that the treat&#x27;s owner would be unable to find the treat if it were out of view. A study found that dogs are able to discriminate an object that a human partner is looking for based on its relevance for the partner and they are more keen on indicating an object that is relevant to the partner compared to an irrelevant one; this suggests that dogs might have a rudimentary version of some of the skills necessary for theory of mind. Dogs can figure what a human is seeing.

<text>John Clifford Cherry (born 22 May 1965) was an Australian Democrats senator from 2001 to 2005, representing the state of Queensland and the Queensland Democrats. In March 2005 he became CEO of the Queensland Farmers Federation.

Cherry was born in Kilcoy, Queensland. He studied law and economics at the University of Queensland, culminating in a master&#x27;s degree in public administration. While at university, he joined the Australian Labor Party. He spent two years as a journalist with the &quot;Townsville Bulletin&quot;, then worked as an industrial officer with the State Public Services Federation until 1993, when he was appointed economics adviser first to Senator Cheryl Kernot, the then Senate leader of the Australian Democrats, and to her successor Meg Lees. As an adviser to the latter, Cherry was a principal player in negotiations for the 1999 introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a measure which was a triumph for the Coalition government led by John Howard but which caused a serious split in the Australian Democrats, leading to electoral downturn and loss of the party&#x27;s Senate representation. He himself was defeated in the 2004 election, ceasing to be a senator on 30 June 2005.

As a senator, Cherry supported protection of Queensland banana growers from potentially diseased imports, conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and superannuation reform to include recognition of same-sex relationships.

<doc id="968213" wikidata="Q1051367" url="?curid=968213" title="Individual Computers Catweasel">
<text>The Catweasel is a family of enhanced floppy-disk controllers from German company Individual Computers. These controllers are designed to allow more recent computers, such as PCs, to access a wide variety of older or non-native disk formats using standard floppy drives.

==Principle==
The floppy controller chip used in IBM PCs and compatibles was the NEC 765A. As technology progressed, descendants of these machines used what were essentially extensions to this chip. Many other computers, particularly ones from Commodore and early ones from Apple, write disks in formats which cannot be encoded or decoded by the 765A, even though the drive mechanisms are more or less identical to ones used on PCs. The Catweasel was therefore created to emulate the hardware necessary to produce these other low-level formats.

The Catweasel provides a custom floppy drive interface in addition to any other floppy interfaces the computer is already equipped with. Industry standard floppy drives can be attached to the Catweasel, allowing the host computer to read many standard and custom formats by means of custom software drivers.

Supported formats:
==Versions==
The initial version of the Catweasel was introduced in 1996 and has since undergone several revisions. The Catweasel Mk1 and Mk2, for the Commodore Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000, sold out in October 2001. The Mk3 added PCI compatibility and sold out in mid-2004. It was succeeded by the Mk4. The Mk2 was re-released in 2006 as a special &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot;.

===Mk1===
The original version of the Catweasel was introduced in 1996 for the Amiga computer, and was available in two versions - one for the Amiga 1200 and one for the Amiga 4000. The Amiga 1200 version connected to the machine&#x27;s clock port; the Amiga 4000 version connected to the machine&#x27;s IDE port. A pass-through was provided on the Amiga 4000 version so that the IDE port could still be used for mass storage devices.

===ISA===
A version of the Catweasel controller was developed for use in a standard PC ISA slot as a means of reading custom non-PC floppy formats from MS-DOS. Custom DOS commands are required to use the interface. Official software and drivers are also available for Windows.

===Mk2 and Mk2 Anniversary Edition===
The Mk2 Catweasel was a redesign of the original Catweasel, merging the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000 versions into a single product that could be used on both computers, and providing a new PCB layout that allowed it to be more easily installed in a standard Amiga 1200 case.

The continued popularity of the Catweasel Mk2 led to a special &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; of this model being released in 2006. The PCB of the Anniversary Edition received minor updates, however it retained the same form factor and functionality as the Mk2.

===Z-II===
The Catweasel Z-II version was an Amiga Zorro-II expansion that combined the Catweasel Mk2 controller with another Individual Computers product, the Buddha, on a single board providing floppy and IDE interfaces to the host computer.

===Mk3===
The Catweasel Mk3 was designed to interface with either a PCI slot, an Amiga Zorro II slot or the clock port of an Amiga 1200. In addition to the low-level access granted to floppy drives, it has a socket for a Commodore 64 SID sound chip, a port for an Amiga 2000 keyboard, and two 9-pin digital joysticks (Atari 2600 de facto standard). The Mk3 was succeeded by the Mk4.

===Mk4 and Mk4plus ===
The Catweasel Mk4 was officially announced on 18 July 2004, with a wide array of new features planned. However, due to manufacturing delays and production backlogs, the Mk4 was not released until early February 2005.

This version of the Catweasel makes heavy use of reconfigurable logic in the form of an Altera ACEX EP1K30TC144-3N FPGA chip, as well as an AMD MACH110 PLD and a PCI interface IC. The Mk4/Mk4+ driver uploads the FPGA microcode on start, which makes easy updates possible without having to replace hardware.

Official software and drivers are available for Windows, and unofficial drivers and utilities are available for Linux.

The Catweasel Mk4Plus appears to be no longer available.

<text>Bisley is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Surrey Heath in Surrey, England, approximately southwest of central London. It is midway between Woking (to the east) and Camberley (to the west). The village had a population of 3,965 in the 2011 Census.

Much of the west of the parish is covered by an acidic heath, which is used by the Ministry of Defence. The National Shooting Centre, headquarters of the National Rifle Association, is within the historic bounds. Coldingley Men&#x27;s Prison is also in the village.

The village is close to junction 3 of the M3 motorway. The nearest railway station is at Brookwood, on the South West Main Line.

Bisley is one of 14 parishes in the U.K. to contain a detached portion or exclave.

==History==
The name &#x27;Bisley&#x27; was first recorded in the 10th century as &#x27;Busseleghe&#x27;. Its manor was from earliest written records under the feudal lordship of Chertsey Abbey as part of Godley Hundred. It is derived from the old English words &#x27;Bysc&#x27;, meaning bushes, and &#x27;Leah&#x27;, a clearing. Therefore, it means clearing where bushes grow or in the bushes. The versions recorded in the 13th century were Busheley and Bussley, from such Westminster and Lambeth Palace rolls as the Assize Rolls.

In medieval times, the village continued to be the southern holding of the Chertsey Abbey estate. The late 12th century church (much of its nave), St John the Baptist, was invested as a proper church in the village by the Abbey monks in the 15th century, who built its mixed brick and timber chancel, since replaced. The church features a medieval bell and a 15th-century porch which is said to have been built from a single oak tree. A nearby spring was once known as the &#x27;Holy Well of St John the Baptist&#x27;, and was said to have medicinal powers. Its waters were used for local baptisms until the early 20th century. The building is Grade II* listed.

A late Tudor monarch granted the manorial lands and revenues of Woking, Chobham, and Bagshot, having dissolved Chertsey Abbey, to Sir Edward Zouch. Henceforth the descent of Bisley was identical to the other two, and all were by 1911 in the possession of the Earl of Onslow, heirs to many of the lands of the original Earldom of Surrey and Arundel.

Actor Barry Evans attended Bisley boys&#x27; school, which was an orphanage run by Shaftesbury Homes.

==Economy==
===Coldingley Prison===
Coldingley Prison – a Category C prison. Several streets were laid out and built-up to house prison officers.

==Amenities==
===School and shops===
The village has Bisley C of E Primary School in the core of the developed part of the village close to its parade of shops, two nursery and a Scout and Guide headquarters. The school&#x27;s 2013 Ofsted report awarded it a rating of Good.

===Playing field===
In the latter half of the 20th century, the Flowers Estate of homes was built, named after flowers of each letter of the alphabet. This adjoins the village&#x27;s largest playing field. The village football club is the academy and training part of Farnborough Town F.C.

===National Shooting Centre===

In 1890, the village became the location for the National Rifle Association&#x27;s Imperial Meeting (the Association&#x27;s National Championship), which moved there from Wimbledon. The competition is hosted on the ranges at Bisley Camp having outgrown the Wimbledon Common ranges which had previously been used. The NRA of the UK also moved its headquarters from London to Bisley Camp.

==Sport==
Bisley is home to Bisley All Stars FC, who are currently a Sunday League club playing in the Surrey &amp; Hants Border League Division 1. They play their home matches at Bisley Recreation Ground. Bisley All Stars currently hold the Isley Cup from their rivals Wisley. It is however highly unlikely it will ever be surrendered given that Wisley F.C. folded at the end of the 2016–17 season.

Despite Bisley All Stars FC finishing the 2017–18 season in 6th place they continue to air their official club song &#x27;Believe&#x27; by Cher before and after every game, honouring their 10-year licensing agreement.

Bisley All Stars in their whole club history have never won a penalty shootout.

At the Lord Roberts Centre indoors is a purpose-built Inline Hockey Rink which is used for league and national events by BiSHA and BiPHA.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.

The proportion of households in the civil parish who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Transport==
===Rail===
The nearest railway station is Brookwood, which has adjoining car parks and fast and slow tracks and a part-non-segregated cycle link. City destinations from Brookwood include Salisbury and Winchester and most popular destination is London.

===Road===
The entire parish is bisected by one main road, the A322 road, which develops a dualled status further north where it joins the M3. Its serves as the main link from western Woking to the motorway network and an alternative link for the Guildford area to western destinations.

<text>Dunning is a small village in Perth and Kinross in Scotland with a population of about 1,000. The village centres around the 12th–13th century former parish church of St. Serf, where the Dupplin Cross is displayed (Historic Scotland; open in summer without entrance charge). It is in Strathearn, north of the Ochil Hills. It is just south of the A9, between Auchterarder and Perth.

==History==

There was an Iron Age fort on Dun Knock (no visible remains) and a 1st-century Roman camp at Kincladie (part of the rampart and ditch survive in Kincladie Wood). The former is the probable origin of the name Dunning, &quot;ex&quot; Old Irish &quot;dúnán&quot; &#x27;little fort&#x27;. Legend tells that Saint Serf (fl. 8th century?) killed a dragon here, and there is a thorn tree planted in Jacobite times.

The Dunning Parish Historical Society website includes St. Serf&#x27;s Church graveyard survey and Dunning parish census records, both useful for genealogy research. The village (except the church) was burned during the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. The oldest surviving house (recently restored) dates from the 1730s.

The fountain at the centre of the village dates from 1874 and was gifted by Alexander Martin, a former Dunning resident, who made his fortune in New Brunswick as a confectioner. It includes interesting stone carvings in a medieval style, including an otter eating a trout.

A plaque on the outer kirkyard wall commemorates the evacuated children (mainly from Glasgow) who stayed here during the Second World War.

The Kirkstyle Inn, dating to the 19th century, is still in operation.

Dunning was served by Dunning railway station on the Scottish Central Railway from 1848 until the station closed in 1956. 

==St. Serf&#x27;s Kirk==

The building has a distinctive and largely intact tower dating from around 1200. The interior was remodelled in the early 19th century to place the pulpit centrally after adding a north wing and internal galleries. Stained glass is of an excellent standard, especially for a rural kirk and is by Ballantine and Gardiner. The kirk was in use until 1972 but is now in the care of Historic Scotland. It is visible to the public at no charge but under supervision.

The kirkyard includes early dated stones 1623 and 1624.

The building was used in the filming of the Scottish film &quot;Complicity&quot;.

===The Dupplin Cross===
The cross was placed in the church after a protest to Historic Scotland at its removal from its home in Dunning.

==Maggie Wall==

In a field north-west of the village stands a sombre 18th-century monument bearing the inscription &quot;Maggie Wall was burnt here 1657 as a Witch&quot;.

==Notable residents==

Notable residents include decorated SAS Commander Brigadier Rory Walker OBE MC. Several of the Lords Rollo lie buried in the kirkyard. Rollo Park is named after the family.

* Rev Paton James Gloag was minister of Dunning from 1848 to 1857 and became Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1889.
* Prof James Robert Matthews FRSE FLS (1889–1978) an eminent 20th century botanist was born and raised in Dunning.
* Sir John Mackay Thomson FRSE (1887–1974) classicist and senior civil servant, son of Dunning&#x27;s minister, Rev Peter Thomson DD.
* Barbara Balmain Dougall wife of renowned geographer and writer John Francon Williams was born in Dunning in 1851. Barbara was one of seven children (Aeneas, David, Margaret, Isabella, Ann, Mary and Barbara) born to John and Ann Dougall. John Dougall was a handloom weaver and his wife Ann was a cotton winder. Barbara and John Francon Williams are the parents of the missionary, chaplain and writer Aeneas Francon Williams and the artist David Dougal Williams.

==Current village==

Dunning Community Trust aims to help shape and improve the village of Dunning and surroundings for future generations. One of the trust&#x27;s main projects is the care of Kincladie Wood.

The village includes a recreation area which embraces a nine-hole golf course, a football pitch and tennis court.

<text>Berolina is the female personification of Berlin and the allegorical female figure symbolizing the city. One of the best-known portraits of Berolina is the statue that once stood in Alexanderplatz.

==Statue==

In 1871, emperor William I ordered an Berolina statue in Belle-Alliance-Platz (today&#x27;s Mehringplatz), to glorify the homecoming victorious troops of the Franco-Prussian War. 

Another statue was designed in 1889 by the sculptors (1846–1911) and Michel Lock (1848–1898) as a decorative element for the state visit of King Umberto I of Italy. The Berolina figure was produced in plaster and was placed on Potsdamer Platz. The statue of showed a woman with a crown of oak leaves. The inspiration allegedly was from a painting in the city hall that featured cobbler&#x27;s daughter Anna Sasse. 

Later, in 1895, the gypsum figure by Hundrieser was copper-melted and unveiled in Alexanderplatz on December 17. Weighing five tonnes, it was placed in front of the site where Hermann Tietz erected his department store in 1904. 

The statue was damaged in the barricade fights of the German Revolution of 1918–19. It had to be removed during the construction of the U5 underground line in 1927, but was set up again in 1933. The nearby , built in 1929–32 according to plans by Peter Behrens, was named after the statue. Finally dismantled on 26 August 1942, it was probably melted down in 1944 for war purposes. A model is preserved at the Märkisches Museum.

In 2000, an association named (&#x27;Recreation and Maintenance of Berolina eV&#x27;) was created with the aim to rebuild the statue.

==Name==
Many Berliner companies are named &quot;Berolina&quot;. A leading German film studio of the 1950s was called Berolina Film. In the past, there were several radio and television broadcasts in which references were made to the city&#x27;s personification. Today, it is the popular name of central Berlin Police radio. A housing cooperative also bears the Berolina name.

In 1980s, the &quot;Berolina&quot; music awards were organized, sponsored by the TV networks ARD, ZDF and ORF, and hosted on television by Thomas Gottschalk on 27 August 1987 with a total of 15 musicians and bands.

Several songs, poems, and plays are named &quot;Berolina&quot;; as for example, works by Kurt Tucholsky, Günter Neumann, Ulli Herzog, and Alexander von Bentheim.

The Main belt asteroid 422 Berolina, is also named after the city.

<text>Paray-le-Monial is a commune in the Saône-et-Loire department in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in eastern France. Since 2004, Paray-le-Monial has been part of the Charolais-Brionnais region. Its inhabitants are called Parodiens and Parodiennes.

==Geography==
Paray-le-Monial is located in the southwest of the Saône-et-Loire Département, in the heart of the Charolais countryside, in a plain bounded by the Brionnais upland, the rivers Loire, l&#x27;Arroux and the Bourbince.

The roughly parallel Bourbince River and the canal du Centre traverse the city from the southeast to the northwest.

Among the elements that form the city, as it has developed over its history, are the upland near the Bourbince River, the priory and basilica, a rectangular town center with very dense housing, national highway N79, which crosses the Bourbince River east and west of the town center, a newer part of town located north of the town center, the Bellevue residential area to the southwest, and several suburbs.

==History==
Paray (&quot;Paredum&quot;; &quot;Parodium&quot;) existed before the monks who gave it its surname of &quot;Le Monial&quot;: when Count Lambert of Chalon, together with his wife Adelaide and his friend Mayeul de Cluny, founded a Benedictine priory there in 973, the borough had already been constituted, with its ædiles and communal privileges. At that time an ancient temple was dedicated to the Mother of God (Charter of Paray). The Cluny monks were lords of the town from 999 until 1789.

Because of its historical association with Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque and Saint Claude de la Colombière, it has been called the &quot;city of the Heart of Jesus&quot;.

<text>The Aero A.20 was a biplane fighter aircraft built in Czechoslovakia in 1923. It was evaluated for Czechoslovak Air Force service against Aero&#x27;s competing A.18 and A.19 designs, a competition that the A.18 won, meaning that this aircraft never entered production, and only a single prototype was ever built.

<doc id="968243" wikidata="Q1569020" url="?curid=968243" title="Philips P2000">
<text>The Philips P2000T home computer was Philips&#x27; first real entry in the home computer market in 1980, after the Philips Videopac G7000 game system (better known in North America as the Magnavox Odyssey2) which they already sold to compete with the Atari 2600 and similar game systems. There was also a P2000M version with an additional 80-column text card for use with a monochrome monitor. This version shipped with a monitor cabinet also housing a dual 5¼-inch floppy disk drive. The P2000C version, introduced in 1982, was portable.

The P2000 systems can be emulated with the MESS software, and since 2015 they are part of MAME. Other emulators also exist.

== P2000T ==
The P2000T was a Z80-based home computer that used a Mullard SAA5050 teletext display chip to produce the video picture and a small Mini-Cassette recorder for 42 kilobytes of mass storage capacity. The Mini-Cassette was treated as a floppy drive from the user&#x27;s perspective, using the automatic search for a program (codice_1 command) or free space (codice_2). A command to display the directory of the cassette was also implemented.

Philips used components they already produced for other markets (television sets and dictation machines) to quickly design a small computer system. It was partially designed by professor Dieter Hammer. Philips used the ROM cartridge system from their Videopac G7000 game system. One of these cartridges contained Microsoft BASIC. 

Although the teletext video chip permitted a quick entry into the home computer market, it was a major weakness of the P2000T. Using the teletext standard allowed it to support eight colors and rudimentary semigraphics, but unlike later entries in the home computer market which also supported a teletext display (such as the BBC Micro and Oric Atmos), the P2000T did not also have a high resolution mode. Consequently few games were developed for the P2000T.

As a result, the P2000T had only limited success, and Philips later replaced it with their MSX machines. The machine did gain popularity in Netherlands, especially in the areas of science, education, and data communications (videotex).

Initially, in 1981, the computer cost 3000 guilders (€2725 in 2015&#x27;s money). In 1984 the price was lowered to 1200 guilders (€967 in 2015&#x27;s money).

== P2000M ==
The P2000M incorporated two 5¼-inch floppy disk drives, besides a built-in monochrome screen. It could run CP/M or Microsoft BASIC applications, depending on the cartridge used. It was incompatible with the P2000T due to the way it handled display of special characters (color, &quot;graphics mode&quot;), which made most P2000T games unplayable.

<doc id="968251" wikidata="Q7728268" url="?curid=968251" title="The Cruel Sea (novel)">
<text>The Cruel Sea is a 1951 novel by Nicholas Monsarrat. It follows the lives of a group of Royal Navy sailors fighting the Battle of the Atlantic during the Second World War. It contains seven chapters, each describing a year during the war.

The novel, based on the author&#x27;s experience of serving in corvettes and frigates in the North Atlantic in the Second World War, gives a matter-of-fact but moving portrayal of ordinary men learning to fight and survive in a violent, exhausting battle against the elements and a ruthless enemy.

==Plot summary==
The action commences in 1939. Lieutenant-Commander George Ericson, a Merchant Navy and Royal Naval Reserve officer, is recalled to the Royal Navy and given command of the fictitious HMS &quot;Compass Rose&quot;, newly built to escort convoys. His officers are mostly new to the Navy, especially the two new sub-lieutenants, Lockhart and Ferraby. Only Ericson and the petty officers are in any way experienced.

Despite these initial disadvantages, the ship and crew work up a routine and gain experience. Bennett, the first lieutenant, a mean and shirking disciplinarian with a penchant for bullying and canned sausages (&quot;snorkers&quot;), leaves the ship ostensibly for health reasons, and the junior officers are able to mature, with Lockhart gaining promotion to first lieutenant.

The crew cross the Atlantic many times on escort duty in all kinds of weather, often encountering fierce storms in one of the smallest ships built to protect Allied convoys. The men endure the ship&#x27;s constant rolling and pitching in the huge waves, freezing cold, the strain of maintaining station on the convoy on pitch-black nights and the fear that at any second a torpedo from a German U-boat could blow them to oblivion. Somehow the tradition of the Royal Navy and the knowledge of the importance of their work carries them through.

They continue the monotonous and dangerous but vital duty of convoy escort, and after one particularly difficult convoy they use all their hard-won knowledge to sink a German submarine. They are nearly sunk several times until in 1943 they are finally torpedoed and forced to abandon ship. Most of the crew die in the freezing waters, but Ericson, Lockhart, Ferraby, and a few others are rescued the next day; however Ferraby suffers a breakdown forcing him to go to hospital.

Ericson, now promoted to commander, and Lockhart, now a lieutenant-commander, take command of a new ship, the fictitious HMS &quot;Saltash&quot;. (In the film adaptation, the ship is called &quot;Saltash Castle&quot; and is portrayed by the , as no River-class vessels were available.)

The Royal Navy is now finally gaining the upper hand over the U-boats and &quot;Saltash&quot; adds to the growing number of kills due to Ericson&#x27;s determination and patience.

In chapter seven the ship receives a message ordering it to &quot;remain on patrol in vicinity of Rockall&quot; as the end of the Second World War approaches in 1945, and as finally hostilities were declared ended, a well-known quote: 

With the war ended, &quot;Saltash&quot; returns to port as a guard to several German submarines that have surrendered.
A secondary plotline concerns Lockhart&#x27;s poignant romance with a beautiful Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service officer.

==Origins and authenticity==
Nicholas Monsarrat&#x27;s own career was the model for that of his character Lockhart, a Fleet Street reporter in the 1930s, commissioned as a naval reservist. Monsarrat spent the war in anti-submarine escort ships, rising to the rank of lieutenant-commander.

Over half a century later, the historian Paul Kennedy still considered Monsarrat&#x27;s fictionalisation of his experiences as the best and most authentic guide to the mentality of the wartime escort commander.

==Film and radio adaptations==
The novel was made into the film &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; in 1953, directed by Charles Frend and starring Jack Hawkins as Commander Ericson and Donald Sinden as Lockhart.

BBC Light Programme produced a radio dramatisation written by Stephen Grenfell and starred Jack Hawkins which was broadcast on 23 February 1955. 

BBC Radio 4 has produced two radio adaptations of the book. In September 1980, a two-hour dramatised version starred Richard Pasco as Ericson and Michael N. Harbour as Lockhart, and with Terry Molloy as the coxswain of &quot;Saltash&quot;. Recording took place with the assistance of the captain and ship&#x27;s company of and the captain of . The narrator was Martin Muncaster. In March 2012, another two-hour version, starred Gwilym Lee as Lockhart and Jonathan Coy as Ericson. Dramatised by John Fletcher and directed by Marc Beeby, this adaptation went on to win &#x27;Best Use of Sound in an Audio Drama&#x27; in the BBC Audio Drama Awards 2013.

In 1998 BBC Radio 2 released a three-hour full-cast dramatisation audiobook as part of the BBC Radio Collection. The novel was adapted by Joe Dunlop. The cast included Donald Sinden (Narrator), Philip Madoc (Ericson), Paul Rhys (Lockhart), Michael Maloney (Ferraby), Helen Baxendale (Julie Hallam), Emma Cunniffe and Jack Davenport. The novel is also available as an audiobook.

<text>The Cruel Sea are an Australian indie rock band from Sydney, New South Wales, formed in late 1987. Originally an instrumental band, they became more popular when fronted by vocalist Tex Perkins (also Beasts of Bourbon). For the majority of the band&#x27;s tenure, the band has featured Jim Elliott on drums, Ken Gormly on bass guitar, Dan Rumour on guitar and James Cruickshank on guitar and keyboards. Between 1990 and 2001, the band released six studio albums – three of which (1991&#x27;s &quot;This Is Not the Way Home&quot;, 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot; and 1995&#x27;s &quot;Three Legged Dog&quot;) were certified platinum by ARIA. The band are also known for their music having featured on television, such as &quot;Better Get a Lawyer&quot; soundtracking an RTA ad targeting drink driving, and &quot;Reckless Eyeballin – an instrumental track from their debut album &quot;Down Below&quot; – becoming the theme of Australian TV police drama &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;. The band has won eight ARIA Music Awards, including five in 1994 for work associated with &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot;.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
Danny Rumour (aka Daniel John Atkins) was a member of punk rock bands Blackrunner, Urban Guerrillas, Friction, Ugly Mirrors and Bedhogs in Sydney from the mid-1970s to 1980. In 1980 he formed Sekret Sekret which played a &quot;sprightly brand of punky power pop with psychedelic overtones&quot;. Sekret Sekret would often play at Sydney pub, The Grand Hotel, with Rumour assembling an &quot;ad hoc&quot; line-up of musicians using instruments housed at the venue. With lead vocalist David Virgin (ex-Ugly Mirrors), Des Devlin (ex-Ugly Mirrors) and Peter Mullany (ex-Johnny Dole &amp; The Scabs) they released four independent singles by 1984. When they broke up in 1984, the line-up was Rumour (guitar), Virgin (vocals), Devlin (guitar), James Elliot (drums) and Ken Gormly (bass guitar).

After Sekret Sekret disbanded, The Cruel Sea was formed in late 1987 by Elliot on drums and Rumour on guitar. They enlisted Dee Corben on bass guitar and his brother, Gerard &quot;Ged&quot; Corben (also in Lime Spiders), on guitar. The name was from a 1964 surf instrumental, &quot;Cruel Sea&quot;, by United States group The Ventures (a cover of The Dakotas&#x27; 1963 single, which was in turn inspired by the novel and film of the same name). Early gigs in 1988 were played at the Harold Park Hotel, behind a pool table where space was so tight that the guitarists had to move out of the way when pool players took a shot. The original line-up played about 20 shows and parties, then Dee Corben left, he was replaced by former Sekret Sekret bandmate, Gormly. Barry Turnbull (ex-John Kennedy&#x27;s Love Gone Wrong, The Widdershins) briefly substituted for Gormly on bass guitar. James Cruickshank (The Widdershins) joined on keyboards and guitars.

===Early albums: &quot;Down Below&quot; and &quot;This Is Not the Way Home&quot;===

In 1989, The Cruel Sea invited vocalist Tex Perkins, their lighting technician and member of Beasts of Bourbon, to join them on-stage. Perkins had written lyrics for some of their instrumentals. The band was signed by Red Eye Records and released a 12&quot; extended play (EP), &quot;Down Below&quot;, in September. It contained nine tracks and was produced by Phil Punch (The Mexican Spitfires) and The Cruel Sea. It was followed by an eleven-track album of the same name, &quot;Down Below&quot; in December 1990; both releases featured Perkins on vocals. &quot;Reckless Eyeballin – an instrumental track on the album – later became the theme song of Australian TV police drama, &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; (1994–2006). Although Perkins was also performing with Beasts of Bourbon, The Cruel Sea built a following on the inner-city pub rock circuit with &quot;atmospheric music [that] evoked the feel of wide open spaces&quot;. During 1990, Ged Corben left to focus on his work with Lime Spiders.

A single, &quot;I Feel&quot; was released in September 1991 ahead of their second album, &quot;This Is Not the Way Home&quot; issued in October. It was produced by Tony Cohen (The Birthday Party, Beasts of Bourbon) and The Cruel Sea. The album provided a range of music &quot;from funky Louisiana swamp blues to sweet soul&quot;. Vocals by Perkins were compared with Captain Beefheart, John Lee Hooker and Tony Joe White. &quot;4&quot; followed in March 1992 with &quot;This Is Not the Way Home&quot; released as a single in August. After the album&#x27;s release, the band toured Europe in support of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. In March 1993 they released, &quot;Black Stick&quot; as a single, which peaked at No. 25 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Singles Chart. &quot;This Is Not the Way Home&quot; received a nomination for &#x27;Best Group&#x27; at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993.

===Mainstream success: &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot; and &quot;Three Legged Dog&quot;===

In early 1993, The Cruel Sea had Perkins on-board full-time with his commitment to Beasts of Bourbon on hold. The Cruel Sea&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot; was produced by the band, Cohen and Mick Harvey (Robert Forster, Anita Lane) of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Released in May, it peaked at No. 4 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and sold over 140,000 copies. The title song, &quot;The Honeymoon Is Over&quot; reached the Top 50 in August. It was followed by a cover of White&#x27;s 1969 song, &quot;Woman with Soul&quot;, which peaked at No. 64. Perkins also performed as a member in the country-blues trio, Tex, Don and Charlie and released &quot;Sad But True&quot; (1993).

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994, The Cruel Sea won &#x27;Single of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Song of the Year&#x27; for &quot;The Honeymoon is Over&quot;, &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27; and &#x27;Best Group&#x27; for &quot;The Honeymoon is Over&quot; and received three further nominations including &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; by Kristyna Higgins and Jay Manby. At an after-party, a drunken guest attacked Higgins, a professional photographer, and a fracas ensued with Perkins defending his partner. Also that night, two of their ARIA trophies were stolen. Late in 1994, the group toured Europe, again supporting Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. They followed with a headlining tour across Europe and to Canada.

The next album, &quot;Three Legged Dog&quot;, was produced by Cohen, the group and Paul McKercher (Clouds). It was released in April 1995 and peaked at No. 1. The Cruel Sea toured Canada, United States and Europe, followed by a support slot for The Rolling Stones on the Australian leg of their Voodoo Lounge Tour. Top 50 singles from &quot;Three Legged Dog&quot; were &quot;Better Get a Lawyer&quot; (November 1994), &quot;Just a Man&quot; (March 1995) and &quot;Anybody But You&quot; (July). The album won an ARIA in 1995 for &#x27;Best Group&#x27; and two nominations, &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;, and &#x27;Best Cover Art&#x27; for Higgins and Jim Paton.

===Later years===

The Cruel Sea&#x27;s next album, &quot;Rock&#x27;n Roll Duds&quot;, was a compilation of b-sides and studio outtakes, released in November 1995. The group had a two-year hiatus in releases, Perkins issued his first solo album, &quot;Far Be it from Me&quot; (1996) and contributed to Beasts of Bourbon&#x27;s &quot;Gone&quot; (1997). The Cruel Sea returned to their instrumental roots and embarked on a series of gigs without Perkins including the Big Day Out tour.

In February 1998, with Perkins returned, the group released a single, &quot;Hard Times&quot; ahead of its album &quot;Over Easy&quot; in August. The album was produced by Daniel Denholm (Frente!, Boom Crash Opera), Phil McKellar (Grinspoon, Frenzal Rhomb), the band and McKercher. It peaked at No. 13 and was followed by their Takin All Day national tour through most of 1998. The band&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;The Most&quot; appeared in November 1999 and reached the Top 50. After the success of his first album, Perkins released his second solo album &quot;Dark Horses&quot; (2000).

In August 2001, ABC TV broadcast the series, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot;. Perkins featured on &quot;Episode 6: Gathering of the Tribes 1984–2000&quot; where he discussed his non-mainstream work with both Beasts of Bourbon and The Cruel Sea, which were &quot;Providing the poor forgotten 5% with something – who like the really fucked up weird shit&quot;. In September their next album, &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke&quot;, produced by Magoo (Regurgitator, Midnight Oil) and the band, appeared and reached the Top 30. It was followed by another compilation, &quot;We Don&#x27;t Work, We Play Music&quot; in October 2002 with &quot;Groovy Situation&quot; issued as a single.

Individual members concentrated on side or solo projects. In early 2005, Perkins returned to Tex Don and Charlie and released &quot;All is Forgiven&quot; in March. Guitarist and main composer, Rumour began touring and recording with his own roots-style instrumental band, the Dan Rumour Band, and Elliot joined on drums by mid-2006. In August, Perkins declared on ABC2&#x27;s &quot;Dig&quot; radio program that The Cruel Sea were no more. Dan Rumour Band appeared on the Australian surf music project &quot;Delightful Rain&quot; released October, and a documentary film of the same name on Australian television in December. Rumour&#x27;s first solo album was released in October 2007 as by Dan Rumour and The Drift.

In spite of his earlier statement, The Cruel Sea with Perkins toured Melbourne and Sydney in 2008 before their Blues &amp; Roots Festival performances. They also toured Australia in 2010. The full band joined Bernard Fanning as support for his Day On The Green tour of Australia in October to November 2013.

Guitarist and keyboardist James Cruickshank died on 8 October 2015 after a long battle with bowel cancer.

In 2023, the band reconvened to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the classic 1993 release, The Honeymoon Is Over, with the addition of longtime collaborator, guitarist Matt Walker. This led to recording sessions for a new album, Straight into the Sun.

<text>Alfred Edgar Coppard (4 January 187813 January 1957) was an English author, noted for his short stories, many of which had rural settings. Largely self-taught, he was championed by Ford Madox Ford and Arnold Bennett, among others, in his lifetime, and more recently by Frank O’Connor, Doris Lessing and Russell Banks. Some of his stories were dramatised for British television in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Life==

Coppard was born the son of a tailor and a housemaid in Folkestone and had little formal education. He grew up in difficult, poverty-stricken circumstances; he later described his childhood as &quot;shockingly poor&quot; and Frank O&#x27;Connor described Coppard&#x27;s early life as &#x27;cruel&#x27;. He quit school at the age of nine when his father died and was &quot;taken off to London&quot; to live with his uncle&#x27;s family in &quot;a street between Old Ford and Victoria Park&quot;. He first worked as an errand boy for a tailor, then as a Reuter&#x27;s messenger. Returning to live with his mother in Brighton, he continued to work in menial jobs, as office boy and junior clerk for small businesses and manufacturing firms – but by the age of 15 he was also earning side money as a professional sprinter, and using that money to buy books. Having married Lily Ann Richardson in 1905,  he left Brighton two years later for Oxford and further clerking jobs. In Oxford his various places of work included the Eagle Ironworks (a job that exempted him from military service). As an ‘irascible autodidact with nascent literary ambitions’, Coppard mixed with undergraduates and attended public lectures; in Oxford he also joined the Independent Labour Party and got to know budding literary figures including Aldous Huxley and Louis Golding. He was part of a literary group, the &quot;New Elizabethans&quot;, who met in a pub to read Elizabethan drama. W. B. Yeats sometimes attended the meetings. During this period he met Richard Hughes and Edgell Rickword, among others. 

The first of his stories to be published was ‘Communion’ in &quot;The Varsity&quot; in 1916; by the end of 1918 he had published six more stories in magazines and the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. 

After the war, Coppard separated from his wife and went to live in ‘Shepherd&#x27;s Pit’, a cottage outside Headington where he set about becoming a full-time writer. Around this time he befriended Robert Graves, who was living nearby in Islip. His first collection, &quot;Adam and Eve and Pinch Me&quot;, was published by the Golden Cockerel Press in 1921 and was a critical success; it was the first of over a dozen short-story collections he published in the 1920s and 1930s. He also published several volumes of poetry, beginning with &quot;Hips and Haws&quot; in 1922. 

In 1932 after Lily Anne had died of cancer, Coppard married Winifred de Kok, with whom he had already had one daughter. Among Coppard&#x27;s other love affairs was a relationship with Gay Taylor, wife of Harold Taylor, who founded the Golden Cockerel Press.

Coppard&#x27;s fiction was influenced by Thomas Hardy and de Maupassant among others. His work enjoyed some popularity in the United States after his &quot;Collected Tales&quot; was chosen as a selection by the Book of the Month Club.

In his mini-biography in &quot;Twentieth Century Authors&quot;, Coppard lists Abraham Lincoln as the politician he admired most. Coppard also listed Sterne, Dickens, James, Hardy, Shaw, Chekhov and Joyce as authors he valued; conversely, he expressed a dislike for the works of D. H. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence, and Rudyard Kipling.

In Nancy Cunard&#x27;s 1937 book &quot;Authors take Sides on the Spanish War&quot;, Coppard endorsed the Republicans.

Coppard&#x27;s nephew was George Coppard, a British soldier who served with the UK Machine Gun Corps during World War I, known for his memoirs &quot;With A Machine Gun to Cambrai&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
Coppard&#x27;s short stories were praised by Ford Madox Ford and Frank O&#x27;Connor. His 1931 collection &quot;Nixey&#x27;s Harlequin&quot; received good reviews from Leonard Strong, Gerald Bullett, and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; (which praised Coppard&#x27;s &quot;brilliant virtuosity as a pure spinner of tales&quot;). Coppard&#x27;s supernatural fiction was admired by Algernon Blackwood. Brian Stableford argues that Coppard&#x27;s fantasy has a similar style to that of Walter de la Mare and that &quot;many of his mercurial and oddly plaintive fantasies are deeply disturbing&quot;. 

Since his death, two selections of Coppard&#x27;s stories have been published: &quot;Dusky Ruth and Other Stories&quot;, with an introduction by Doris Lessing, and &quot;The Hurly Burly and Other Stories&quot;, edited by Russell Banks. In his introduction, Banks praises Coppard&#x27;s treatment of women: &quot;Like Maupassant, [he] was a careful, affectionate, compassionate observer of the lives of women, particularly poor, abandoned, or &#x27;fallen&#x27; women.&quot; Reviewing Banks&#x27;s selection in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, Blake Morrison noted that Coppard&#x27;s tales &quot;are chiefly concerned with ... romantic intrigue, disappointment and despair&quot; but that his best work had rural settings: &quot;[Coppard&#x27;s] rare forays into an urban middle-class setting are unconvincing; unless his characters are speaking in rural dialect, with a keen attentiveness to the natural world, they sound off key.&quot; 

=== Adaptations ===
Some of Coppard’s short stories have been adapted for British television. In December 1967 a BBC1 &quot;Omnibus&quot; programme directed by Jack Gold featured versions of ‘The Field of Mustard’, ‘Adam and Eve and Pinch Me’ and ‘Dusky Ruth’. The 1972 ITV series &quot;Country Matters&quot; adapted five more Coppard stories - ‘The Higgler’, ‘The Black Dog’, The Watercress Girl’, ‘The Sullens Sisters’ and ‘Craven Arms’ - and was shown as part of the &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; series in the USA.

<text>was a Japanese mathematician and computer scientist.

In 1952, he graduated the Department of Mathematics, the Faculty of Science, the University of Tokyo, and obtained his Bachelor of Science. That same year, he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics of the University of Tokyo. He obtained his Doctor of Science (DSc) degree from the University of Tokyo in 1961, under the direction of Shokichi Iyanaga. In 1962, he was appointed Associate Professor in the Faculty of Science at Gakushuin University, and was promoted in 1966 to the rank of Professor. He became a professor of Theoretical Foundation of Information Science in 1972. After retiring from the University of Tokyo in 1990, he moved to Tokyo Denki University.

The Yoneda lemma in category theory and the Yoneda product in homological algebra are named after him.

In computer science, he is known for his work on dialects of the programming language ALGOL. He became involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a Japanese representative on the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, supports, and maintains the languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

<text>K͟hadíjih-Sulțán Bagum (1822 – September 15, 1882) was the wife of the Báb. She is sometimes referred to as K͟hadíjih Bagum, K͟hadíjih Bigum or K͟hadíjih K͟hánum.

==Biography==

===Background===
The second daughter of her parents, Khadíjih Bagum, was born in 1822 in Shiraz, with the given name K͟hadíjih-Sultán Shírází. The appellation &quot;Bagum&quot; (meaning &quot;Lady&quot;) should be understood as a mark of respect and not as part of her name. Her father, Áqá Mír ʻAlí, was a merchant involved in importing goods from Bushehr, contributing to the family&#x27;s mercantile business, though he was the least successful among its members. Khadíjih&#x27;s mother, Ḥájíyyih Bíbí of Jahrum, had been widowed before marrying Khadíjih&#x27;s father. From her mother&#x27;s first marriage, Khadíjih had a half-brother named Muhammad-Mihdí, a renowned poet, and a half-sister known as ʻAmmih Ḥájí, who later married Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʻAlí, the guardian of the Báb during his childhood Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʻAlí. Khadíjih had three full siblings: two brothers, Ḥájí Mírzá Abu&#x27;l-Qasim, who continued the family tradition in commerce, and Ḥájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, who pursued a career as a teacher of medicine and also studied theology. Additionally, she had one sister named Zahrá.

During her childhood, Khadíjih was familiar with the Báb, as they were second cousins once removed and often played together. However, as they matured, societal customs dictated that they no longer met. In his early adulthood, the Báb embarked on prolonged pilgrimages to Karbala, causing distress to his mother, who sought a means to anchor the 23-year-old Báb in Shiraz – leading to the expedited arrangement of his marriage to Khadíjih Bagum, perhaps as a strategy to dissuade him from leaving the city.

===Marriage life and developments===

At the age of 20, Khadíjih Bagum married the Báb on August 25, 1842, in Shiraz, officiated by the city&#x27;s imam, Shaykh Abú-Turáb. The newlywed couple established their home in a modest compound alongside the Báb&#x27;s mother, Fátimih Bagum. In 1843, Khadíjih gave birth to their sole child, a son named Ahmad, who died a few months later. Ahmad was initially interred near Bíbí-Dukhtarán in Shiraz, although his remains were later relocated. The childbirth was fraught with difficulties, endangering Khadíjih&#x27;s life, and she never conceived again. The loss of her only child was a profound sorrow, but the Báb provided solace, assuring her of their son&#x27;s place in heaven. The death of her only child was very hard for her to bear, and the Báb consoled her, assuring her that their son was in heaven. Recollecting the early days of their marriage, Khadíjih later remarked that they were among the happiest moments of her life. Khadíjih played a significant role as the first witness to her husband&#x27;s purported revelation in early April 1844, just before the declaration to Mulla Husayn. After her husband&#x27;s journey to Isfahan for safety, she lived a solitary life with the Báb&#x27;s mother and her closest confidante, an African servant named Fiddih. Despite the separation, she found comfort in the letters sent by her husband, revealing their loving relationship. Updates regarding the Báb were infrequent for Khadíjih and Fátimih Bagum. Family members often harbored resentment and embarrassment about their connection to the Báb, distancing themselves from Khadíjih. Only her sister Zahrá, dressing incognito as a peasant, ventured to bring news of the Báb.

At the age of 28, Khadíjih was widowed when the Báb was killed by a firing squad. She then moved into the house of her sister Zahrá. Fearing for her health, the men of the household thought it prudent to keep the Báb&#x27;s death a secret from her and his mother for almost a year. However, with the death of the uncle of the Báb, as well as his 18-year-old son, the secret could not be kept. The women were distraught, and all three men were mourned together. The mother of the Báb was horrified, and decided to retire to Karbala. This departure meant that Khadíjih was dependent only on Fiddih and her sister. &quot;Her departure from Shiraz added greatly to my burden of sorrow and deepened the sadness of my heart. I had no longer by my side a comforter whose love and sympathy and care had sustained me over the years,&quot; she remarked.

===Later life===
According to her own later account, she had recognized the Báb&#x27;s religious station before the Báb had declared his mission to Mulla Husayn. She later recognized Baháʼu&#x27;lláh&#x27;s claim, and became a Baháʼí. She kept in correspondence with Baháʼu&#x27;lláh while she had returned to Shiraz and lived in her previous home. She was greatly revered by the Baháʼís; many visited her whilst journeying to see Baháʼu&#x27;lláh. One occasion the very young Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán, accompanied by her brother, visited. “They stayed for fifteen days, and those were some of the happiest days of my life” she later reflected.

Later she was to make a journey to &#x27;Akká to visit Baháʼu&#x27;lláh in 1882 with her nephew who was to come from Yazd. However, when her nephew went straight to Ottoman Syria, she was not able to go, as women could not travel alone. After hearing the news, her health rapidly decreased. She died on September 15, 1882, at the age of sixty, and was buried in Shiraz. The same night her devoted maid and closest friend, an African named Fiddih, died too. In the &quot;Kitáb-i-Badíʻ&quot;, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh gives her the title of &quot;Khayru&#x27;n Nisa&quot; (The Most Virtuous of Women) and forbids all women, save Fátimih Bagum, the Báb&#x27;s mother, from adopting the title.

<doc id="968269" wikidata="Q4054810" url="?curid=968269" title="Ablative armor">
<text>Ablative armor is armor which prevents damage through the process of ablation, the removal of material from the surface of an object by vaporization, chipping, or other erosive processes. In contemporary spacecraft, ablative plating is most frequently seen as an ablative heat shield for a vehicle that must enter atmosphere from orbit, such as on nuclear warheads, or space vehicles like the Mars Pathfinder probe. A large amount of developmental usage was on the early 1960s rocket powered X-15 crewed aircraft traveling at hypersonic speeds in excess of Mach 6.5 (roughly 5,000 mph). The idea is also commonly encountered in science fiction. In the 2000s, the concept saw widespread usage in robot combat as a method of reducing impact energy transfer to vital components.

Ablative armor is distinct from the concept of reactive armor which is actually in common use in modern armored vehicles. 

==Uses in fiction==
===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===
Ablative hull armor appears in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. Having been introduced in the year 2371 of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&#x27;s fictional future timeline, it features on starships including the , USS &quot;Prometheus&quot;, and an upgraded USS &quot;Voyager&quot;.

The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual&quot; explains that ablative armor works in two stages: When the shields are hit by an energy or particle weapon, thermal energy from the ship is dissipated across the hull. The boil-off rate creates a particle cloud that is dense enough to disperse the incoming beam&#x27;s energy.

&quot;Regenerative ablative armor&quot; is powered armor that can restore the ablated material.

===&quot;DarkSpace&quot;===
In the online game &quot;DarkSpace&quot;, ablative armor is utilized to counter projectile-based damage while making the ship more vulnerable to lasers and energy-based weapons.

=== &quot;Gundam&quot;===
In the Universal Century time line of the &quot;Gundam&quot; series, ablative coatings are used to minimize the effect of beam weapons, called beam resistive coating and a later improved version, Anti-beam coating.

In the Cosmic Era time line, the ablative armor concept is applied in similar capacity to the anti-beam coating and laminated armor technologies utilised by mobile suits as a form of protection against beam and laser weaponry. Selected spacecraft are also able to deploy ablative gel for high-velocity atmospheric reentries.

In the Anno Domini time line, the Earth&#x27;s three space elevators are covered by ablative armor plates to protect their structures from damage. When one of the elevators is partially destroyed, purging these plates require the technical crew to jettison the counterweight at the orbital end in order to avoid the now-unbalanced elevator&#x27;s complete collapse.

===&quot;EVE Online&quot;===
In the online game &quot;EVE Online&quot;, ablative armor plating is utilized as a secondary defensive layer that protects the relatively fragile internal systems. Depending on the ship&#x27;s loadout configuration, a ship can continuously repair incoming damage on the armor, fit additional armor plates to sustain large amounts of damage in the short term, or remotely repair friendly ships&#x27; armor using specialized modules. The rate at which the armor gets depleted depends on the types of damage incurred to the armor and the armor&#x27;s resistance value against each particular type of damage.

Armor plating is usually considered strong against electromagnetic and thermal damage, and weak against kinetic energy penetrators and bombardment of subatomic particles (explosive), although a few exceptions exist.

===&quot;Mass Effect&quot;===
In the console and PC game &quot;Mass Effect&quot; there are several variants of armor for all species referred to as ablative. 

===&quot;Warhammer 40000&quot;===
In the tabletop RPG Inquisitor, ablative armor may be layered on top of other armor. If the ablative armor is struck, it is destroyed (after the damage caused by the attack is reduced accordingly). Ablative armor may have additional properties such as added resistance to heat- or laser-based weaponry; if special ablative armor is destroyed, it loses those additional properties. Unlike other types of armor in-game, ablative armor is quite cheap to purchase (since it is so easily destroyed). 

In the tabletop wargame some armored vehicles, like the Astra Militarum&#x27;s Sentinel walker, have ablative plating to help reduce damage to the pilot and survive the high power weaponry often faced in the game&#x27;s setting. 

===&quot;Battle Pirates&quot;===
In &quot;Battle Pirates&quot;, ablative armor is used to increase resistance to explosive damage on a ship. 

===&quot;Traveller&quot; ===
In the table top role playing game &quot;Traveller&quot;, ablative armor (referred to as Ablat) is an equipment option for characters to protect them from laser fire or other energy weapons. In the second edition of &quot;Traveller&quot; published by Game Designers&#x27;s Workshop in 1981, Ablat is described as an &quot;Ablative (vaporizing anti-laser) jacket&quot; available for 75 credits on Tech Level 9+ worlds. The 2016 Mongoose &quot;Traveller Central Supply Catalog&quot; also includes Ablat with the same cost and technology requirement.

<text>The Foreign Claims Act, (-2736), or FCA, is a United States federal law enacted on January 2, 1942, that provides compensation to inhabitants of foreign countries for personal injury, death, or property damage caused by, or incident to noncombat activities of United States military personnel overseas. Although the U.S. Government&#x27;s scope of liability under the FCA is broad, certain classes of claimants and certain types of claims are excluded from the statute’s coverage. Procedures for adjudicating an FCA claim are substantially different from the general procedural pattern for other types of claims against the government. Chapter VIII, part B, of the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps Manual prescribes the requirements for the investigation and adjudication of FCA claims.

<text>The Aero A.25 was a biplane military trainer aircraft developed in Czechoslovakia from the Aero A.11 reconnaissance-bomber and generally similar to the Aero A.21 night trainer.

Some A.25s were powered by the less powerful 134 kW (180 hp) Breitfeld &amp; Danek Perun I engines, in which case they were designated Aero A.125.

<text>This is a list of films featuring the United States Marine Corps.

==History of Marines in film==
Beginning with The &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; (1918), the Marines discovered the use of motion pictures. In exchange for a favorable portrayal that stimulated recruiting and gave an impressive view to the public and Congress, the Marines provided uniformed extras, locations, equipment, and technical advisers that provided their expertise to the producers. In 1926 MGM&#x27;s &quot;Tell It to the Marines&quot; and Fox&#x27;s &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; directed by Raoul Walsh nearly led to a court battle to see whether one studio could copyright the Marines to prevent other films from being made. Allan Dwan&#x27;s &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, starring John Wayne, is frequently cited as one of the most influential Marine films. Over the years, Camp Pendleton was dressed up to represent Central American nations, China, Pacific islands, New Zealand, and Joseph H. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Retreat, Hell!&quot; had the base covered in studio snow with their hills and roads painted white. Camp Pendleton later doubled as Vietnam in Marshall Thompson&#x27;s &quot;To the Shores of Hell&quot;. When filming &quot;Battle Cry&quot; at the base in 1954, Raoul Walsh&#x27;s Marine technical adviser said that he had joined the Corps after seeing &quot;What Price Glory?&quot;. United States Marine Corps Recruit Training was also depicted in Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;The D.I.&quot; and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; that led to more enlistments to the Corps. Most recently, the Gulf and Iraq wars have become the subject of controversial films such as &quot;Jarhead&quot; and &quot;Generation Kill&quot;.

<text>Yakubu Ayegbeni (born 22 November 1982), known mononymously as Yakubu, is a Nigerian football agent and former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is nicknamed &quot;The Yak&quot;. In September 2024 he came out of retirement when he signed a short term deal for Enfield Town who play in the National League South 

His performances in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League for Maccabi Haifa earned a loan move to English club Portsmouth which became permanent as they were promoted to the Premier League in 2003. He has since appeared in over 250 Premier League matches for Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Everton, and Blackburn Rovers, and is the fourth highest African goalscorer in Premier League history with 96 goals. He is the third highest scorer in the history of the Nigeria national football team, and represented them at four African Cup of Nations finals, the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Yakubu was born in Benin City, Edo State. He started his career with Julius Berger in Lagos as a teenager in the Nigerian Premier League. He was later loaned to Portuguese club Gil Vicente.

===Maccabi Haifa===
Israeli side Maccabi Haifa paid Julius Berger $300,000 for his signature. Yakubu&#x27;s highest scoring season at Haifa was 2001–02, when he scored 13 times in 22 games (League season was 33 matches). He came to England and trained with Derby County but could not obtain a work permit at the time. He scored seven goals in eight European Cup appearances in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League, (including a hat-trick against Olympiakos and a penalty in the 3–0 win over Manchester United).

===Portsmouth===
Yakubu moved to English club Portsmouth of the First Division (now the Championship) on loan on 6 January 2003. Signed by Harry Redknapp, Yakubu helped Portsmouth win the 2002–03 First Division title, scoring at a rate of one goal in every two games (7 in 14 matches). He made his debut as a 57th-minute substitute for Vincent Péricard in a 1–1 away match versus Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 18 January. On 1 February he started for the first time and scored after 4 minutes at home to Grimsby Town. The match ended 3–0 with Yakubu substituted for Péricard after 89 minutes. Seven days later, Yakubu scored a goal in each half of a 6–2 victory over Derby County for his first brace in English football. He gained his second brace of the season with two first-half goals in a 5–0 away victory at Millwall on 1 March.

Yakubu made his loan spell at Portsmouth permanent in May 2003 for a fee of £4 million. He played 37 of Portsmouth&#x27;s 38 Premier League matches in 2003–04, starting all but two. Yakubu&#x27;s 16 goals made him the club&#x27;s leading goal-scorer, and joint-sixth highest scorer in the entire league.

Yakubu scored his first Premier League goal in his second match, opening a 1–1 draw versus Manchester City on 23 August 2003. After eight consecutive league matches without a goal, he scored a brace in a League Cup match away to Nottingham Forest on 29 October, one of which was in extra time of the 4–2 win. Yakubu scored the final goal of a 6–1 home win over Leeds United on 8 November. On 3 January 2004, he scored an 89th-minute winner in the FA Cup third round match at home to Blackpool. Three days later he scored an equaliser in the Premier League as Portsmouth lost 2–1 away to Aston Villa. On 10 January he scored his first Premier League brace with two goals in the second half of a 4–2 home win over Manchester City. He played at the 2004 African Cup of Nations.

Yakubu ended the season with 11 goals in his last 10 Premier League matches, starting with one each in four straight games, the first being the only goal in the South Coast derby versus Southampton on 21 March. This was followed by a late winner against Blackburn Rovers in a 2–1 away victory, and an equaliser away to Charlton Athletic. On the final day of the season, he scored four goals as Portsmouth defeated Middlesbrough 5–1.

In the 2004–05 season he scored 13 goals. His final goal for Portsmouth in May 2005 before he left the club – the equaliser in a 1–1 home draw to Bolton Wanderers in the penultimate league game of the season – was the goal that ensured Portsmouth would not be relegated from Premiership in the 2004–05 season.

Yakubu&#x27;s 28 Premier League goals between his two seasons make him Portsmouth&#x27;s highest ever scorer in the Premier League, with nine more than their second-highest scorer Benjani Mwaruwari.

===Middlesbrough===
After the 2004–05 season, he transferred from Portsmouth to Middlesbrough for a £7.5 million record fee, the highest for a Nigerian ever. Yakubu scored the only goal of the game with a penalty in the first leg of the UEFA Cup last 16 round at home against Roma, giving Middlesbrough a 1–0 victory, who later went through on away goals. His performances were rewarded, as he helped Middlesbrough reach the 2006 UEFA Cup Final against Sevilla, in which they lost 4–0.

His transfer from Portsmouth to Middlesbrough in July 2005 is one of those about which the Stevens inquiry report in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman.

===Everton===
Yakubu was transferred to Everton in August 2007 for a fee of £11.25 million on a five-year contract, which was at the time the most the club had ever paid for a player. Shunning the traditional centre-forwards&#x27; number 9, Yakubu asked to be assigned number 22, setting this number as a goal-scoring target for his first season, a feat he fell one goal short of achieving. He scored 11 minutes into his debut for the club, the first goal in a 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium in September 2007. His first hat-trick for the club came against Fulham in a 3–0 home league win in December 2007.

Yakubu travelled to Ghana in early 2008 to compete in the Cup of Nations. Following Nigeria&#x27;s exit from the competition, he was late in returning to his club, and as a result was dropped by manager David Moyes once back in England. His double against Newcastle United in a 3–1 win at Goodison Park on the last day of the 2007–08 season helped the &quot;Toffees&quot; clinch fifth place and a place in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup competition. He finished his first season with 15 Premier League goals to his name, and 21 goals in all competitions for Everton. Yakubu achieved his highest goal tally for a single season, and also became the first Everton player since Peter Beardsley to net 20 goals in a season.

Yakubu scored his 100th goal in English football in a league game at West Bromwich Albion early in the Premier League 2008–09 season. He scored a goal against Standard Liège in the UEFA Cup and got back on the scoresheet with a goal against Middlesbrough, his first goal in 10 games. He ruptured his achilles tendon in the 1–0 away win at Tottenham Hotspur on 30 November, ruling him out for the rest of the season. Yakubu played his first competitive game after the Achilles tendon injury against Burnley Reserves, and in his first start for the first team in almost a year, he scored within 11 minutes against Hull City in the League Cup. He came on for Jô in first-half injury time and scored an equaliser with his first touch to bring Everton level at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea. He later scored the winning goal against Stoke.

===Leicester City===
Yakubu joined Leicester City on loan until the end of the season on 13 January 2011, with the possibility of a permanent transfer. He made his debut and scored in a 1–1 draw against Preston North End on 15 January 2011, followed by another goal in a 4–2 win over Millwall on 22 January.

On 12 February 2011 he scored a left footed volley in their 2–0 win over local rivals Derby County. On 2 April 2011, he scored his first hat-trick against his former club Middlesbrough. He then scored a double in Leicester&#x27;s 4–2 win over Watford.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 31 August 2011, Yakubu signed a three-year contract with Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee and was assigned the number 24 shirt by manager Steve Kean. He scored his first and second goals for Blackburn Rovers on 17 September on his Premier League debut against Arsenal in which Blackburn won 4–3. He was voted Man of the Match as he helped Blackburn to their first win of the season, with Blackburn fans chanting &quot;Feed the Yak and he will score!&quot; by the time the final whistle blew. He scored his third goal in the league in the 3–3 away draw against Norwich City. Yakubu&#x27;s fourth and fifth goals of the league season came in an away 3–3 draw at Wigan Athletic on 19 November 2011. He opened the scoring from long range after 65 seconds and equalised with an injury-time penalty. He had earlier been behind an incident when Blackburn were 2–1 down, by dummying a short corner to allow team-mate Morten Gamst Pedersen to dribble the ball from the corner and cross for Junior Hoilett to equalise the game 2–2. At the end of the game, Yakubu admitted that he did not touch the ball and that the goal should not have stood.

On 3 December 2011, Yakubu scored all four goals for Blackburn in a 4–2 home win over Swansea City. He scored two in each half, finishing with a penalty. It was his first Blackburn hat-trick and his first four-goal game since the last day of the 2003–04 season, for Portsmouth against Middlesbrough. He scored 2 goals, one being a penalty, in his side&#x27;s shock 2–3 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 31 December 2011 which left him on 13 goals for the season in all competitions. On 15 January 2012, in a match against Fulham, Yakubu was sent off for the first time in the Premier League for a straight red. On his return from suspension, he scored against QPR. On 10 April 2012, Yakubu scored twice, while missing one penalty and scoring a second, in Blackburn&#x27;s 2–3 loss at home to Liverpool. In his first season at Blackburn, he scored 18 goals, but the club were relegated to the Championship by the end of the season after a 1–0 home loss to in-form Wigan Athletic. After relegation was confirmed, Yakubu stated that he did not want to play Championship football and wanted to leave Blackburn.

===Guangzhou R&amp;F===
Yakubu confirmed on 28 June 2012 that he had left Blackburn and had signed for Chinese side Guangzhou R&amp;F, on an initial three-year contract. On 15 July, Yakubu made his Chinese Super League debut in a Guangzhou Derby match which Guangzhou R&amp;F played against Guangzhou Evergrande at Tianhe Stadium. He scored the winning goal of the match in the 87th minute, ending Guangzhou Evergrande&#x27;s 34-league-home-match unbeaten run.

===Reading===
On 2 February 2015, Reading signed free agent Yakubu on a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. On 14 February, Yakubu scored his first goal for the &quot;Royals&quot; with the winner in a 2–1 defeat of Derby County at Pride Park to put the club into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. Yakubu was released by Reading on 21 May 2015.

===Kayserispor===
On 31 August 2015, Yakubu signed a one-year contract, with the option of an additional year, with Süper Lig side Kayserispor.

===Coventry City===
On 13 February 2017, Yakubu signed for Coventry City until the end of the 2016–17 season. On 5 April 2017, having featured only three times due to suffering a hamstring injury, Yakubu&#x27;s Coventry City contract was terminated by mutual consent. He announced his retirement from football on 22 November 2017.

==International career==
Yakubu has scored 21 goals in his 58 appearances for Nigeria since his 2000 debut. He is currently the third highest international goalscorer for Nigeria.

===2000 Summer Olympics===
In September 2000, Yakubu featured in Nigeria&#x27;s squad for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Australia. Nigeria were the holders for the tournament. Then of Maccabi Haifa, the 17-year-old Yakubu wore the number 9 shirt. He scored the injury-time equaliser in Nigeria&#x27;s first match, a 3–3 draw with Honduras on 13 September in Adelaide. He also played against the hosts Australia on 16 September in Sydney as his side won 3–2 but did not play on 19 September as they drew with Italy in Adelaide. He featured in the quarter-finals as Nigeria lost 4–1 to Chile in Melbourne on 23 September.

===2002 African Cup of Nations and 2002 FIFA World Cup===
Yakubu made his full international debut on 22 April 2000 in a 4–0 home win in Lagos against Eritrea in qualification for the 2002 African Cup of Nations. He scored his first international goal in an away win against Namibia on 16 June 2001 in the same qualification campaign. On 1 July 2001, he scored his first international brace, with the second and fourth goals in a 4–0 away win over Sudan in the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification stage. He was named in the squad for the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations in Mali and was given the number 8 shirt by manager Shuaibu Amodu. On 9 February 2002, Yakubu scored the only goal of the third-place play-off against Mali after 29 minutes. However, Yakubu was not named later in the year in the squad selected by new manager Festus Onigbinde for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.

===2004 African Cup of Nations===
On 7 June 2003, Yakubu scored Nigeria&#x27;s first two goals as they came from behind to beat Malawi 4–1 in a qualifier for the 2004 African Cup of Nations. He retained the number 8 shirt in the squad named for the finals in Tunisia by manager Christian Chukwu but did not score. Alongside Celestine Babayaro and Victor Agali, he was sent home from the tournament for indiscipline. His then manager at Portsmouth, Harry Redknapp said he cared less about the tournament and was glad to have Yakubu back.

===2006 FIFA World Cup qualification===
Yakubu scored the final goal in an away 3–0 victory over Zimbabwe and an equaliser in an away 1–1 draw against Gabon as Nigeria were beaten to the qualification place by Angola and missed the finals for the first time since 1994. Despite having a superior goal difference of +14 to +8, Nigeria did not qualify as the tie-breaker was head-to-head matches between Nigeria and Angola.

===Decision against 2006 African Cup of Nations===
Although Nigeria gained a place at the tournament due to their performance in World Cup qualification, Yakubu decided not to play at the 2006 African Cup of Nations to concentrate on his form at Middlesbrough instead. He was praised for his decision as the club defeated defending champions and league leaders Chelsea 3–0.

===2010 FIFA World Cup===
At the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Yakubu notably missed an open goal from three yards against South Korea in the last Group game but later went on to score a penalty to tie the match. Yakubu&#x27;s penalty made sure that Nigeria earned a result of 2–2 draw, but this was not enough for his side to progress out of the group stages.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Yakubu married Yvonne Lameen Ikhana, the daughter of former Nigerian international footballer Kadiri Ikhana, who is also the father-in-law to former Nigerian international footballer Patrick Ovie. Yakubu and Ikhana have two daughters. He used to play barefoot on the streets of Benin, Nigeria, until his brother gave him a pair of boots aged 12.

<text>Bertram Evelyn (Bill) Smythies (11 July 1912 (Nainital, India) – 27 June 1999 (Redhill, England)) was a British forester and ornithologist.

== Life ==
Bertram &#x27;Bill&#x27; Smythies, the elder brother of John Raymond Smythies, was born in India in 1912. His father E. A. Smythies, was silviculturist of Uttar Pradesh (and, in the 1940s, Chief Conservator of Forest of Nepal), His mother Olive Smythies &quot;née&quot; Cripps was the author of &quot;The Tiger Lady&quot;. After school in the UK, Bill read botany and forestry at Balliol College, Oxford.

Bill&#x27;s grandfather Arthur Smythies (1847- 1934) came to India in 1873 to join the Indian Forest Service and served until 1902 around Dehra Dun. Bill&#x27;s father Evelyn (Arthur&#x27;s son) had degrees in forestry and geology from Oxford and served in the Indian Forest Service from 1908 to 1940. Evelyn was based in Nainital, where Bill was born in 1912. He wrote:
&quot;... &quot;started hill trekking at the age of six months, camping in tents in the hills of Kumaon... brought up within sight of Nanda Devi and Trisul - who could fail to have a love of mountains and natural history?&quot;&quot;

Bill Smythies&#x27; father took up a contract post of Forest Advisor to the Maharaja of Nepal and moved to Kathmandu after 1940 and stayed on till 1947. During this time Bill used to visit his father in Nepal and had access to places that were normally out of bounds for foreigners. Bill Smythies joined the Burma Forest Service in 1934. During this time he explored the botany and ornithology of these Burmese regions with his Kachin guide and friend Sumdu Mai. He spoke fluent Burmese, Jingpo, Malay and Iban. He was a great fan of the British botanist and explorer Kingdon-Ward.

In January 1949 Bill was appointed to the Colonial Forest Service in Sarawak where he spent 15 years. At the age of 52, the day he left Sarawak. in 1964 he married Florence Mary (Jill) Rogers a noted botanical artist. The next fifteen years were spent in the Spanish Sierras, the mountains of Britain, the Alps and the Pyrenees before moving to England. In 1986, Bill Smythies endowed the Jill Smythies Award in honour of his wife whose career as a botanical artist had been cut short by an accident to her right hand. It has been given annually since 1988 by the Linnean Society of London &quot;to a botanical artist in recognition of excellence in published illustrations, such as drawings or paintings, in aid of plant identification, with the emphasis on botanical accuracy and the accurate portrayal of diagnostic characteristics&quot;. The entry criteria specifies that the award is for botanical art that it &#x27;an aid to identification and a portrayal of diagnostic characteristics&#x27; and excludes &quot;flower paintings that are merely artistic&quot; and &quot;illustrations of cultivars of garden origin.&quot; Jill Smythies died in 1994. She was survived by Bill who would die in 1999.

<text>Gwen Harwood (née Gwendoline Nessie Foster, 8 June 19205 December 1995) was an Australian poet and librettist. Harwood is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s finest poets, publishing over 420 works, including 386 poems and 13 librettos. She won numerous poetry awards and prizes, and one of Australia&#x27;s most significant poetry prizes, the Gwen Harwood Poetry Prize is named for her. Her work is commonly studied in schools and university courses.

Gwen Harwood was the mother of the author John Harwood.

==Life==
Harwood was born on 8 June 1920 in Taringa, a suburb of Brisbane. She attended Brisbane Girls Grammar School and was an organist at All Saints&#x27; Church when she was young. She completed a music teacher&#x27;s diploma, and also worked as a typist at the War Damage Commission from 1942. Early in her life, she developed an interest in literature, philosophy and music.

She married linguist Bill Harwood in September 1945, shortly after which they moved to Oyster Cove south of Hobart as he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Tasmania. Here she developed her lifelong interest in the work of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein &quot;which informs her entire opus&quot;.

Her father played piano, violin, guitar and the flute. Both Gwen and her brother were given piano lessons, and originally Gwen wanted to be a musician. Gwen&#x27;s grandmother introduced her to poetry; this inspired her and became her lifelong calling and passion.

==Literary career==
Harwood had written poetry for many years, and her first poem was published in &quot;Meanjin&quot; in 1944, but her work did not start appearing regularly in journals and books until the 1960s. Her first book of poems, titled &quot;Poems&quot;, was published in 1963, followed in 1968 by &quot;Poems Volume II&quot;. Other books include &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1981), &quot;Bone Scan&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Present Tense&quot; (1995). There are also several versions of a &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, including one from Penguin in 2001.

Harwood used a range of pseudonyms in her early work, such as &quot;Walter Lehmann&quot;, &quot;W. W. Hagendoor&quot; (an anagram of her name), &quot;Francis Geyer&quot;, &quot;Timothy (TF) Kline&quot;, &quot;Miriam Stone&quot;, and &quot;Alan Carvosso&quot;. Most of her poems submitted for publication under her own name were initially rejected. The editor of &quot;Meanjin&quot;, C. B. Christesen, once rejected a poem from Harwood but used an expression in it (&quot;the freckled shade&quot;) as the title of one of his own poems. In 1961 &quot;The Bulletin&quot; accepted a sonnet from her alter ego Walter Lehmann, but only after it was published was it brought to the attention of the editor, Donald Horne, that the initial letters of each line formed the phrase &quot;FUCK ALL EDITORS&quot;. After this, she found much greater acceptance.

She also wrote libretti for composers such as Larry Sitsky, James Penberthy, Don Kay and Ian Cugley.

She corresponded over the years with several poet friends, including Vincent Buckley, A. D. Hope, Vivian Smith, and Norman Talbot, as well as family and other friends such as Tony Riddell, and two volumes of her letters have been published. She served as president of the Tasmanian Branch of the Fellowship of Australian Writers.

Her poetry has been used by many students who are completing the Higher School Certificate (HSC) in New South Wales, Australia, by Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) students in Victoria, Australia, by the International Baccalaureate (IB) in Australia, and by Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) students in Western Australia, Australia.

==Literary themes and style==
Harwood&#x27;s poetry has recurring themes of motherhood and the stifled role of women, particularly those of young mothers. Her poem &quot;In the Park&quot; established a certain feminist reputation but others of her poems treat motherhood in a more complex and nuanced way. Music is another recurring motif. The Tasmanian landscape, and Aboriginal dispossession of that landscape, form another theme in much of her writing. She also wrote series of poems with recurring characters, two of the most notorious being Professor Eisenbart and Kröte. Many of her poems also include biblical references and religious allusions.

The style and technique of Harwood&#x27;s poetry has led to several of her works being employed by the New South Wales Board of Studies as prescribed texts for the High School Certificate. Primary focus in the English course is placed on the analysis of the themes expressed in Harwood&#x27;s poetry, and how such themes are relevant in modern society. Her work is also used as a text for the Victorian Certificate of Education and West Australian Certificate of Education Literature Courses in the poetry section for its literary value and complex themes.

<text>The Secret Bench of Knowledge (formerly Secret Bench, Lost Paradise) is a sculpture created by Canadian artist Lea Vivot and produced in multiple castings. A prominent one is located at the entrance to the Wellington Street Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa, where it was initially placed in 1989 on the artist&#x27;s own initiative. One year later Vivot removed it and it was replaced four years later by Eugene Boccia from Toronto. The sculpture was unveiled at about 9 AM on the morning of May 1, 1994 in front of a crowd of about 3000 people. The sculpture has many messages inscribed on it, written by school children, about the importance and pleasure of reading.

Other locations for the sculpture include various cities in Ontario (including Sarnia), as well as Montreal (June 1989) and New York City.

The unveiling of the new statue was done by Vivot, assisted by a young blind boy named Gabriel McBride, from Spruce View, Alberta, who inscribed his message in Braille.

<doc id="968320" wikidata="Q126503" url="?curid=968320" title="Filippo Inzaghi">
<text>Filippo &quot;Pippo&quot; Inzaghi (; born 9 August 1973) is an Italian professional football manager and former player who played as a striker. He is the head coach of club Pisa.

He was nicknamed &quot;Superpippo&quot; (&quot;Super Goof&quot;) or &quot;Alta tensione&quot; (&quot;High Tension&quot;) by fans and commentators during his playing career. His younger brother, Simone Inzaghi, is also a football manager and former player.

Regarded as one of the greatest strikers of his generation, Inzaghi played for several Italian clubs, and spent the most notable spells of his club career with Juventus and AC Milan, winning two UEFA Champions League titles (2003, 2007), and three Serie A titles (1998, 2004, 2011). He is the seventh highest scorer in Italy, with 313 goals scored in official matches. He is currently the sixth-highest goal scorer in European club competitions with 70 goals, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Raúl and Karim Benzema. He is also Milan&#x27;s top international goal scorer in the club&#x27;s history with 43 goals. He also holds the record for most hat-tricks in Serie A with 10.

At international level, Inzaghi earned 57 caps for the Italy national team between 1997 and 2007, scoring 25 goals. He represented his country at three FIFA World Cups, winning the 2006 edition, and he also took part at UEFA Euro 2000, where he won a runners-up medal.

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
Inzaghi&#x27;s favourite footballers as a child were Paolo Rossi and Marco van Basten. The elder brother of fellow footballer Simone Inzaghi, he got his start playing for hometown club Piacenza as a teenager in 1991, but made only two league appearances before being loaned to Serie C1 side Leffe, with whom he scored an impressive 13 goals in 21 matches. In 1993, Inzaghi moved to Serie B club Hellas Verona and scored 13 goals in 36 league appearances. Upon his return to Piacenza, he scored 15 times in 37 games helping his team win Serie B and proving himself to be an exciting young prospect.

Inzaghi made his Serie A debut when he transferred to Parma in 1995, but scored only twice in 15 league matches. One of these two goals came against one of his former clubs, Piacenza, literally &quot;making him cry&quot;. He added another two goals in European competitions that season. The following season, he moved on to Atalanta, finishing as the &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; (Serie A&#x27;s top scorer) with 24 goals after scoring against every team in the league. He was awarded Serie A Young Footballer of the Year and served as team captain in the last game of the season.

=== Juventus ===
Inzaghi, however, was soon on the move once again to his sixth team in seven seasons, this time to Juventus for a reported 23 billion lire. He formed a formidable attacking partnership along with Alessandro Del Piero and Zinedine Zidane, a tandem which would last for four seasons, under managers Marcello Lippi, and subsequently Carlo Ancelotti, marking Inzaghi&#x27;s longest stint with one team at the time. During his time with the &quot;Bianconeri&quot;, he scored two Champions League hat-tricks – against Dynamo Kyiv and Hamburger SV – becoming the first player to do so.

During his first season with the club, Inzaghi scored two goals as Juventus beat Vicenza 3–0 in the 1997 Supercoppa Italiana. Juventus won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; during the 1997–98 season, in which Inzaghi scored 18 goals, including a decisive, &quot;Scudetto&quot;-winning hat-trick against Bologna. He also scored six goals to help Juventus reach the Champions League final, although they were defeated 1–0 by Real Madrid.

The 1998–99 season was less successful for Juventus, as they were defeated in the 1998 Supercoppa Italiana by Lazio and finished the season seventh place in Serie A. Inzaghi still managed 20 goals in all competitions, finishing the season as the club&#x27;s top-scorer; Six of his goals came in the Champions League, as Juventus were eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions Manchester United. During the second leg of the semi-finals in Turin, Inzaghi scored two goals in the first ten minutes, but Manchester United eventually managed to come back and win the match 3–2.

Inzaghi helped Juventus win the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, scoring five goals in the semi-finals against Rostov, and two in the finals against Rennes, qualifying Juventus for the UEFA Cup that season. Inzaghi scored 15 goals in Serie A as Juventus narrowly missed out on the title to Lazio, defeated on the final matchday. The following season, Inzaghi managed 11 goals in Serie A as Juventus finished second in the league for the second consecutive season; he also scored five goals in the UEFA Champions League, including a hat-trick in a 4–4 draw against Hamburger SV, although Juventus were eliminated in the first round. With 16 goals in all competitions, he was Juventus&#x27;s top goalscorer for the third consecutive season. However, his once-effective partnership with Del Piero had become less effective in recent seasons, due to their lack of understanding, individualism, and their strained relationship both on and off the pitch.

=== AC Milan ===

Despite scoring a high 89 goals in 165 games for the &quot;Bianconeri&quot;, Inzaghi was soon benched in favour of David Trezeguet and on 2 July 2001 signed for AC Milan for a reported 70 billion lire, or 45 billion lire cash plus Cristian Zenoni (Sky Sports reported a smaller total figure, £17 million) for the 2001–02 campaign by coach Fatih Terim. Juventus announced that the sale of Inzaghi produced a capital gain of €31.1 million to the club, making the actual transfer fee much exceed that figure. Inzaghi, however, suffered a knee injury and missed the first half of the season. Upon his return, he was able to forge a strong goalscoring partnership with Andriy Shevchenko, and he soon earned many trophies with the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; under new manager Carlo Ancelotti, among them the 2002–03 Champions League (in which Milan defeated his previous team, Juventus, in the final on penalties), along with the 2002–03 Coppa Italia (scoring in a 2–2 draw in the second leg), the 2003 UEFA Super Cup, the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana, and the 2003–04 &quot;Scudetto&quot;. In the 2002–03 Champions League campaign, he scored his record third Champions League hat-trick against Deportivo de La Coruña in the Group Stage and a decisive goal in quarter-finals against Ajax, totalling 12 European goals in that season. In November 2004, he signed a contract extension with the club.


Inzaghi fully recovered from the persistent knee injuries that had dogged him for two years and regained his predatory goalscoring form by scoring 12 goals in 22 Serie A matches in 2005–06, along with four goals in five Champions&#x27; League appearances; two against Lyon in the quarter-finals and another two against Bayern Munich in the first knockout stage. He scored the decisive goal against the Bavarians in the 2007 quarter-finals, helping Milan to reach the semi-finals of the competition. On 23 May 2007, in the 2007 Champions League final in Athens, he scored both of Milan&#x27;s goals in their 2–1 victory over Liverpool in a rematch of the 2005 final. He declared after the match:

At the start of the 2007–08 season, he picked up where he left off in Athens, scoring the equalizer in the Super Cup in Milan&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Sevilla. Inzaghi capped off the year by scoring two goals in the final of the 2007 Club World Cup, helping Milan win 4–2 against Boca Juniors to take revenge for the defeat on penalties in 2003.

On 24 February 2008, Inzaghi scored the match-winning goal in Milan&#x27;s 2–1 win over Palermo with a diving header after coming into the game from the bench; it marked his first Serie A goal in over a year. This was followed by ten more goals in the league, the last against Udinese. This strike against Udinese was his 100th goal for the club in official games. But despite incredible form, Italy national team manager Roberto Donadoni declined to call him for Euro 2008. In November 2008, Inzaghi agreed to a contract extension with Milan until June 2010.

On 8 March 2009, Inzaghi scored his first hat-trick of the season for Milan against Atalanta, leading his team to a 3–0 victory at the San Siro. His 300th career goal came in the 5–1 thrashing of Siena away from home. He then went on to score three goals against Torino, his second professional hat-trick in that season. Scoring this hat-trick enabled him to set a record for the player with the most hat-tricks in Serie A over the last 25 years. With ten hat-tricks in Serie A, Inzaghi is ahead of Giuseppe Signori (9), Hernán Crespo (8), Roberto Baggio, Marco van Basten, Gabriel Batistuta, Abel Balbo, Vincenzo Montella (7), Antonio Di Natale and David Trezeguet (6). Inzaghi scored one hat-trick for Atalanta, four for Juventus, and five for Milan.

In the 2009–10 season, under manager Leonardo, Inzaghi was relegated to the role of backup player with his contract set to expire in June 2010. On 21 May 2010, he was offered a new one-year contract which would last until 30 June 2011.

On 3 November 2010, in the UEFA Champions League 2010–11 Group Stage campaign, with Milan trailing by 1–0 to Real Madrid, Inzaghi came off the bench in the second half and scored a brace to give Milan a 2–1 lead. Pedro León, however, equalized in the 94th minute, with the final score ending 2–2. On that occasion, he became the new all-time top scorer of all European club competitions with 70 goals. He also became the second-oldest player to score in the Champions League, aged 37 years and 85 days, behind only Manchester United&#x27;s Ryan Giggs, now surpassed by Inzaghi&#x27;s compatriot Francesco Totti. With these two goals, Inzaghi went ahead of his idol Marco van Basten on the club list of the all-time top goalscorers with 125 goals.

On 10 November 2010, Inzaghi suffered a serious injury while playing for Milan against Palermo. A statement on the official Milan club website confirmed that Inzaghi had suffered a lesion of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and associated lesion to the external meniscus of the left knee. It was thought he would be out for the rest of the season. Due to his age, this injury could have ended his career; nonetheless, Inzaghi was optimistic. On 7 May 2011, with Inzaghi still out recovering from his injury, Milan won the 2010–11 Serie A title. After being sidelined by injury for six months, he came off the bench for the first time since his injury on 14 May, with Milan defeating Cagliari 4–1. He extended his contract till June 2012 during the 2011–12 pre-season.

Just like with Andrea Pirlo in 2011, Milan decided not to renew the contracts of several veteran players at the end of the season and Inzaghi was one of those, along with Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf, Alessandro Nesta and Gianluca Zambrotta. He played his final game for Milan against Novara on 13 May 2012 and marked his performance by scoring the winning goal. On 24 July 2012, Inzaghi announced his retirement from professional football to start a coaching career.

=== European competition records ===
With 70 goals, Inzaghi is the sixth-highest scorer in European club competitions, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Robert Lewandowski, Raúl and Karim Benzema. He became the first player to score two Champions League hat-tricks – both with Juventus – when he netted a treble during a 4–4 group stage draw with Hamburger SV on 13 September 2000; his first was in a 4–1 victory over Dynamo Kyiv during the 1997–98 quarter–finals. Inzaghi scored a record third Champions League hat-trick in a 4–0 win against Deportivo de La Coruña in the 2002–03 season, while playing for Milan. This record would later be tied by Michael Owen, who scored two hat-tricks for Liverpool and a third for Manchester United.

== International career ==
Between 1993 and 1996, Inzaghi made 14 appearances for the Italy under-21 team, scoring three goals; he was also a member of the Italy under-21 squad that won the 1994 UEFA European Under-21 Championship. Inzaghi earned his first senior cap for Italy in the Tournoi de France, against Brazil on 8 June 1997, under his former under-21 manager Cesare Maldini, and provided an assist to goalscorer Alessandro Del Piero. Italy went on to draw 3–3. He scored his first goal for Italy on 18 November 1998, in a 2–2 friendly draw against Spain; he has since scored 25 goals in 57 appearances. He was called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Euro 2000, the 2002 World Cup and the 2006 World Cup.
Although Inzaghi went scoreless throughout the 1998 World Cup, as he was mainly deployed as a substitute, he came off the bench to set up a goal for Roberto Baggio in Italy&#x27;s final group match against Austria, which ended in a 2–1 win, and allowed Italy to top their group; Italy were knocked out in the quarter-finals on penalties to hosts and eventual champions France. At Euro 2000, he was one of Italy&#x27;s starting strikers under the new Italy manager Dino Zoff. He scored two goals throughout the tournament; his first came from a penalty, in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 opening group win over Turkey, in which he was named man of the match, while his second came in a 2–0 win over Romania in the quarter-finals of the competition; he also set up Stefano Fiore&#x27;s goal in a 2–0 win over co-hosts Belgium in his nation&#x27;s second group match of the tournament. His performances helped Italy reach the final, where they were defeated by France once again, on a golden goal. Along with Francesco Totti, he was Italy&#x27;s top-scorer throughout the tournament.

Under Zoff&#x27;s replacement, Giovanni Trapattoni, Inzaghi was Italy&#x27;s top goalscorer during the qualifying rounds of the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, scoring his first and only international hat-trick in a 4–0 home win over Wales on 6 September 2003, although he missed the latter tournament due to injury. He went scoreless throughout the 2002 World Cup, making two appearances, as Italy were controversially eliminated in the round of 16 to co-hosts South Korea; in Italy&#x27;s 2–1 loss to Croatia in their second group match, Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over halfway to Inzaghi in the 90th minute, but everyone missed the ball and it rolled into the back of the net, although the goal was disallowed after referee Graham Poll claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponent&#x27;s shirt. Inzaghi also had a goal wrongly disallowed in Italy&#x27;s final group match against Mexico, which ended in a 1–1 draw.

Inzaghi&#x27;s persistent knee and ankle injuries put a halt to his international play for almost two years before his resurgence at club level, which resulted in being called up by Italy coach Marcello Lippi for the 2006 World Cup final tournament. Due to the abundance of other top strikers such as Alessandro Del Piero, Francesco Totti and Luca Toni, Inzaghi made his only appearance – subbing on for Alberto Gilardino – in Italy&#x27;s final group stage match against the Czech Republic on 22 June 2006, scoring his only goal in the tournament, rounding Petr Čech in a one-on-one encounter to net Italy&#x27;s second goal, which made him the oldest player to have scored for Italy in a World Cup, after Daniele Massaro. Italy went on to win the tournament, defeating France on penalties in the final.

Following Italy&#x27;s fourth World Cup victory, Inzaghi made six appearances under new manager Roberto Donadoni in Italy&#x27;s UEFA Euro 2008 qualification campaign, scoring three goals, two of which came in a 2–1 away win against the Faroe Islands on 2 June 2007. He was not called up for the final tournament, however, where Italy were eliminated by eventual champions Spain in the quarter-finals on penalties, and he made his last appearance for Italy on 8 September 2007, in a 0–0 draw against France in Milan.

Inzaghi is currently the sixth-highest goalscorer in the Italian national team&#x27;s history, with 25 goals, alongside Adolfo Baloncieri and Alessandro Altobelli.

==Style of play==

Inzaghi was an intelligent, extremely fast, agile, and opportunistic player, with excellent reactions and a lanky, slender physique; although not very technically gifted, he was known for his great skill in taking advantage of the carelessness of his opponents, his excellent positional sense in the area, and his eye for goal, making a name for himself as a &quot;goal poacher&quot;, due to his style of play and tendency to operate mainly in the penalty box, as well as his timing and ability to find spaces and anticipate opponents to get on the end of passes. These qualities, along with his finishing ability with both his head and feet, made him one of the most prolific strikers of the past decades. Inzaghi was described as a player who lived on the offside line.

When he was first called up to the national team, the other Italian players were surprised at his lack of technical accomplishment, but came to accept him because he scored so frequently. Johan Cruyff described this contrast—&quot;Look, actually he can&#x27;t play football at all. He&#x27;s just always in the right position.&quot; Fans nicknamed him &quot;Superpippo&quot;, the Italian name for Super Goof, the superhero alter ego of cartoon character Goofy (&quot;Pippo&quot; being a common hypocorism of his first name &quot;Filippo&quot;). Tactically, Inzaghi was noted for his vision and ability to read the game, as well as his outstanding offensive movement off the ball, ability to play off the shoulders of the last defender, and to time his attacking runs to beat the offside trap, which allowed him to get on the end of passes, but also to provide depth to his team, leading long-time Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to quip: &quot;That lad must have been born offside.&quot;

Although in the past, due to his poor defensive work-rate and lack of notable technical skills, strength in the air or long range striking ability, he was initially accused by some in the sport for being a limited striker or a &quot;lucky&quot; player, and also drew criticism at times for being selfish, for not participating in the build-up of plays, and for going to ground too easily, he has been praised by several of his former managers and teammates for his prolific goalscoring. Despite his lack of significant talent, Inzaghi and others attribute his success, aside from technical prowess, to personal drive, intelligence, and determination. Due to his opportunistic playing style, Inzaghi was frequently compared to Paolo Rossi throughout his career. Despite his prolific goalscoring, Inzaghi was often considered injury-prone throughout his career.

== Managerial career ==

=== AC Milan ===
Inzaghi started his coaching career at the beginning of the 2012–13 season, signing a two-year deal as the manager of AC Milan&#x27;s &quot;Allievi&quot; (under-17) team.

On 9 June 2014, Inzaghi was named manager of Milan&#x27;s first team after the dismissal of his former &quot;Rossoneri&quot; teammate Clarence Seedorf. In Inzaghi&#x27;s first match as a manager in Serie A on 31 August, Milan defeated Lazio 3–1 at the San Siro. Inzaghi then led Milan to a second consecutive win in a match that ended with a 5–4 Milan win against Parma.

On 4 June 2015 Adriano Galliani, the CEO of Milan, announced that Inzaghi would not be the coach for next season. He was officially dismissed on 16 June 2015.

===Venezia===
On 7 June 2016, Inzaghi was appointed as the new coach of ambitious Lega Pro club Venezia. On 19 April 2017, after beating Parma to top spot, he won promotion to Serie B as champions. He also won the Coppa Italia Lega Pro in the same season.

During the 2017–18 season, Inzaghi guided the Venetians to a fifth-place finish in Serie B, finishing in the playoffs positions to earn promotion to Serie A. After eliminating Perugia (coached by his former teammate Alessandro Nesta) in the preliminary round, his team was defeated by Palermo in the semi-finals.

===Bologna===
On 13 June 2018, Inzaghi was announced as the new head coach of top-flight Bologna, taking over from Roberto Donadoni. He faced a Lazio side coached by his younger brother Simone in an eventual 0–2 defeat on 26 December. Following a record of two wins in 21 games, he was dismissed on 28 January 2019 and replaced by Siniša Mihajlović.

===Benevento===
On 22 June 2019, Inzaghi was appointed manager of Benevento in Serie B. On 30 June the following year, his club achieved promotion as champions with seven games remaining, reaching Serie A for the second time in their history. On his Serie A debut for the team, they won 3–2 at Sampdoria on 26 September, having been losing 2–0. Benevento ended the 2020–21 Serie A season in eighteenth place, being relegated back to Serie B after only one season; as a consequence of the events, Inzaghi was not offered a new contract and left Benevento afterwards.

===Brescia===
On 9 June 2021, Inzaghi was appointed manager of Brescia in Serie B. On 16 August, Inzaghi made his debut for Brescia in the first round Coppa Italia match losing 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out after a 2–2 draw in the extra-time.

On 23 March 2022, Inzaghi was dismissed by club chairman Massimo Cellino, leaving the club in fifth place in the league table. After his successor Eugenio Corini was eliminated in the promotion playoff semifinals by Monza, on 25 May 2022 Cellino formally reappointed Inzaghi as head coach, due to a clause that was legally forbidding his sacking if Brescia were placed in one of the top eight league places.

===Reggina===
On 12 July 2022, Inzaghi was appointed manager of Reggina in Serie B, signing a three-year deal with the Calabrians. After guiding Reggina to a spot in the promotion playoffs, he was released together with all players and staff as Reggina were excluded due to financial issues, thus finding himself without a job by the beginning of the 2023–24 season.

===Salernitana===
On 10 October 2023, relegation-struggling Serie A club Salernitana announced the appointment of Inzaghi in place of outgoing Paulo Sousa. He was sacked on 11 February 2024 and replaced by Fabio Liverani.

===Pisa===
On 3 July 2024, Inzaghi signed for Serie B club Pisa.

==Media==
Inzaghi features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover for the Italian edition of &quot;FIFA 2001&quot;, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

In 2015, the arcade game company Konami announced that Inzaghi would feature in their football video game &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2016&quot; as one of the new myClub Legends.

===Early years===
Born in Port Harcourt, West was discovered by Monday Sinclair, who recruited him to play for Sharks. He started playing professionally with Obanta United in 1989, before returning to Sharks in 1990. West then played for Enugu Rangers in 1991, before joining Julius Berger in 1992.

===Auxerre===
Following successful trials in early 1993, West joined French side Auxerre led by Guy Roux. He was on the bench during a 2–2 UEFA Cup draw against Tenerife on 15 September 1993, but failed to make his debut. West eventually played his first competitive game for the club in a 0–0 away league draw at Toulouse on 5 March 1994. He became a first team regular in the following season, making 31 appearances in all competitions. In the 1995–96 season, West helped Auxerre win their first league title in the club&#x27;s history, alongside such players as Laurent Blanc and Sabri Lamouchi, among others. They also won the national cup, thus collecting the double. West subsequently made seven appearances in the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League, as the club was eliminated in the quarter-finals by the eventual champions Borussia Dortmund.

In June 1997, West was transferred to Italian side Inter Milan, on a four-year deal. He made his competitive debut for the club in a 1–0 Coppa Italia victory over Foggia on 3 September 1997. Subsequently, West scored his first goal for Inter in a 2–1 Serie A win against Atalanta on 9 November 1997.

In November 2000, West moved to English club Derby County, on an initial three-month loan. He made his debut for the Rams on 18 November 2000, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 home league win over Bradford City which was Derby&#x27;s first league win of the season. In January 2001, West signed an extension to stay with the Derbyshire side until the end of the 2000–01 season.

He made his debut for the team in a 5–1 home league win over St. Pauli on 17 November 2001, starting the match and earning a yellow card in the process, before being substituted in the 81st minute. In April 2002, West was released by the club due to their &quot;total disagreement&quot;. He made a total of 10 league appearances in the 2001–02 season.

In August 2002, West trained with English side Manchester City for 10 days. He eventually failed to get a contract due to lack of fitness.

===Partizan===
On 24 January 2003, it was announced that West would join the reigning FR Yugoslavia champions Partizan under newly appointed manager Lothar Matthäus. He arrived in Belgrade for the final negotiations with the club five days later. On 30 January 2003, West signed an 18-month contract with Partizan. He made his official debut for the club on 1 March 2003, playing the full 90 minutes in a 4–2 home league victory over Radnički Obrenovac. West scored his first goal for Partizan in a 4–0 home league win over Vojvodina on 7 May 2003. Eventually, the club convincingly won the 2002–03 First League of Serbia and Montenegro title. Subsequently, West was one of the most influential players on the way to helping Partizan reach the group stage of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, eliminating Newcastle United on penalties in the third qualifying round. He managed to record three appearances in Group F, despite missing numerous games in the first half of the 2003–04 season due to injuries. In February 2004, West left the club by mutual consent.

Two years later, West was named in the 22-man squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, together with Jay-Jay Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, and others. They reached the second stage of the tournament, but were eliminated by Denmark in the round of 16.

He also represented his country in the tournament&#x27;s 2002 edition, finishing in third place. Additionally, West was a member of the team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He made two appearances in the &quot;Group of Death&quot;, as Nigeria finished bottom of the table, behind Sweden, England and Argentina. After the tournament, Nigeria coach Festus Onigbinde blamed West for the team&#x27;s failure, stating that the player &quot;flouted&#x27; his instructions.

In January 2004, West suffered an injury during the team&#x27;s training session that ruled him out of the African Cup of Nations. He returned to the national team on 17 August 2005, making his final appearance for the Super Eagles in a friendly against Libya.

In April 2013, Žarko Zečević, former Partizan general secretary, said that West is 12 years older than his claimed age. Shortly afterwards, West denied the accusation.

<text>Kenneth Cyril Bruce Allott (29 August 1912 – 23 May 1973) was an Anglo-Irish poet and academic, and authority on Matthew Arnold.

==Life==
Allott was the elder son of Hubert Cyril Willoughby Allott and his wife Rose (née Finlay). Born in Glamorgan, where his father, a doctor, was serving as a locum, Allott was raised at Nenthead, Cumbria, and later experienced the break-up of his parents&#x27; marriage, followed by the death of his mother. After she died he and his brother Guy were adopted by their Irish aunts on Tyneside, and from the age of 14 attended St Cuthbert&#x27;s Roman Catholic Grammar School in Newcastle on Tyne. He was popularly known as &#x27;Speedy&#x27;, because he spoke so quickly. Despite the fact that the VI Form then taught only science for Higher School Certificate, he studied English and Latin on his own at the back of the class. In 1934, he gained a first at Armstrong College, Durham University, in Newcastle. He married Surya Kumari Lall in 1936. His first was followed by post-graduate research at Oxford University.

Subsequently, Allott began working as a reviewer for the &quot;Morning Post&quot; and with Geoffrey Grigson on &quot;New Verse&quot;, to which he was a regular contributor. He also worked as an observer for Charles Madge&#x27;s social survey group Mass Observation. In 1942 Allott, a conscientious objector, moved with his family to Gateshead for a year as an extramural lecturer.

After his first marriage ended in 1950, he married another lecturer, Miriam Farris, on 1 June 1951.

Allott is the author of a biography of Jules Verne and two collections of poems (see works below), a critical edition of William Habington&#x27;s poems, and a play adapted from EM Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;A Room with a View&quot;.

He held positions at Liverpool University from 1948 until his death in 1973, at which time he was the Andrew Cecil Bradley Professor of Modern English Literature. His position at Liverpool was taken over by his wife after his death until 1981, when she was appointed a professor at Birkbeck College.

==Works==
His poetry was published in &quot;Poems&quot; (1938, Hogarth Press), and &quot;The Ventriloquist&#x27;s Doll&quot; (1943, Cresset Press). Perhaps his best-known poem was &#x27;Lament for a Cricket Eleven&#x27;. He was regarded by many as one of the most promising poets of the day; Francis Scarfe devoted a whole chapter to him in &quot;Auden and After&quot;.
Allott became general editor of the five-volume &quot;Pelican Book of English Prose&quot; (1956) and of the &quot;Oxford History of English Literature&quot;. His familiar yellow anthology &quot;The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse&quot; (1950; revised and enlarged 1962) was used widely in colleges. Inspector Wexford has been seen reading it on television.

Allott published &quot;Selected poems of Winthrop Mackworth Praed (1953);
&quot;Five Uncollected Essays of Matthew Arnold&quot; (1953); and &quot;The Poems of Matthew Arnold&quot; (1965). He also published &quot;Robert Browning : Selected Poems&quot; (1967).

Allott&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published posthumously in 1975. He was a witty and popular lecturer, with a great affection for cats. He also smoked heavily, believing wrongly that an earlier bout of tuberculosis would confer protection. He did in fact die of lung cancer.

A new revised and expanded edition of Allott&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, edited, introduced and annotated by Michael Murphy], was published in 2008.

<text>A children&#x27;s hospital (CH) is a hospital that offers its services exclusively to infants, children, adolescents, and young adults from birth up to until age 18, and through age 21 and older in the United States. In certain special cases, they may also treat adults. The number of children&#x27;s hospitals proliferated in the 20th century, as pediatric medical and surgical specialties separated from internal medicine and adult surgical specialties.

==Integration==
Children&#x27;s hospitals are characterized by greater attention to the psychosocial support of children and their families. Some children and young people have to spend relatively long periods in hospital, so having access to play and teaching staff can also be an important part of their care. With local partnerships, this can include trips to local botanical gardens, zoos, and public libraries for instance. Designs for the new Cambridge Children&#x27;s Hospital, approved in 2022, plan to fully integrate mental and physical health provision for children and young people, bringing together services of three partners: Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Cambridge with physical and mental health services located alongside research activity.

==Staffing==

In addition to psychosocial support, children&#x27;s hospitals have the added benefit of being staffed by professionals who are trained in treating children. A medical doctor that undertakes vocational training in paediatrics must also be accepted for membership by a professional college before they can practice paediatrics. These include the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), and the American Board of Pediatrics. In New Zealand, the RACP offers vocational training in paediatrics. Once RACP training is completed the doctor is awarded the Fellowship of the RACP (FRACP) in paediatrics. While many normal hospitals can treat children adequately, pediatric specialists may be a better choice when it comes to treating rare afflictions that may prove fatal or severely detrimental to young children, in some cases before birth. Also, many children&#x27;s hospitals will continue to see children with rare illnesses into adulthood, allowing for a continuity of care.

==History==
=== Early Voluntary Care ===
Prior to 19th century hospital reforms, the well-being of the child was thought to be in the hands of the mother; therefore, there was little discussion of children&#x27;s medicine, and as a result next to no widespread formal institutions which focused on healing children.

Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children&#x27;s hospitals. Florence&#x27;s Hospital of the Innocent (Ospedale degli Innocenti) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health. Foundling hospitals such as the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741 were created to receive abandoned infants, nurse them back to health, teach them a trade or skill, and integrate them back into society.

Dispensaries funded by donations also provided medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care. The Scottish paediatrician George Armstrong, who established the first British dispensary, in 1769, was against in-patient care for sick children. Armstrong stated: But a very little reflection will clearly convince any thinking person that such a Scheme as this can never be executed. If you take away a sick child for its Parents or Nurse, you break its heart immediately.Objections to admission were sometimes based on pragmatic reasons, e.g. reducing the threat of cross infection from children with diseases such as typhus, diphtheria and measles, that were a major cause of infant mortality. The voluntary nature of hospitals meant that such outbreaks were very costly.

=== 19th-century models ===
In the mid-19th century western world, middle-class women and physicians became increasingly concerned about the well-being of children in poor living conditions. Although infant mortality had begun to decline, it still remained a prominent issue. Social reformers blamed the emergence of the industrial society and poor parents for not properly caring for their children. By the 1870s, the prevalent view among doctors and nurses was that children were better off by being removed to hospital, away from the often poor, unsanitary conditions at home. In response, reformers and physicians founded children&#x27;s hospitals.

By the early 19th century, children&#x27;s hospitals opened in major cities throughout Europe. The first formally recognized paediatrics hospital was the Hôpital des Enfants Malades in Paris, which opened in 1802. Great Ormond Street Hospital was established in London in 1852, and was the first British children&#x27;s hospital. The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania was created in 1855. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh was the first children&#x27;s hospital in Scotland and opened in 1860. The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Ontario was the first Canadian children&#x27;s hospital and opened in 1875. By the end of the 19th century, and the during the first two decades of the 20th century, the number of children&#x27;s hospitals tripled in both Canada and the United States. From the 1850s to around 1910, most cities in the UK had built children&#x27;s hospitals, which included a large number of prestigious hospitals such as the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Royal Manchester Children&#x27;s Hospital.

Early western children&#x27;s hospitals were independent institutions funded by voluntary donations, and from research. Often, children could only be admitted if they were sponsored by a letter of recommendation from a hospital affiliate. The &quot;undeserving poor&quot; were sent to workhouse infirmaries, whilst middle class children were generally cared for, and indeed operated on, at home. Hospitals set their own rules and had their own way of working, including regulating admissions. They often excluded children under the age of two on humanitarian and pragmatic grounds and were often hesitant to admit children who required long-term care in fear that those lives would be lost or that long-term care would block beds for those in immediate need.

Early children&#x27;s hospitals focused more on short-term care and treating mild illnesses rather than long-term intensive care. Treating serious diseases and illnesses in early children&#x27;s hospitals could result in the disease spreading throughout the hospital which would drain already limited resources. A serious disease outbreak in a children&#x27;s hospital would result in more deaths than lives saved and would therefore reinforce the previous notion that people often died while in the hospital.

=== Professionalization of Children&#x27;s Hospitals ===
In the 19th century, there was a societal shift in how children were viewed. This shift took away some of the parents&#x27; control and placed it in the hands of medical professionals. By the early 20th century, a child&#x27;s health became increasingly tied to physicians and hospitals. This was a result of licensing acts, the formation of medical associations, and new fields of medicine being introduced across countries. New areas of medicine offered physicians the chance to build their careers by &quot;overseeing the medical needs of private patients, caring for and trying new therapies on the sick poor, and teaching medical students.&quot; In order to raise their status further, physicians began organizing children&#x27;s hospitals; by doing so, it also brought attention and importance to their speciality in the modern health care system.

Voluntary or religiously associated female care was often replaced by care provided by professionally trained nurses.

== Critiques of children&#x27;s hospital care ==
Historically, many children&#x27;s hospitals limited the ability of children and parents to interact, such as by limiting visiting hours. This approach was criticised for decades before shifts in practice occurred.

Surgeon James Henderson Nicholl of the Glasgow Hospital for Sick Children, who pioneered day surgery procedures such as Hernia and cleft palate, stated in 1909 that: &#x27;[I]n children under 2 years of age, there a few operations indeed that cannot be as advantageously carried out in the out patient departments as in the wards.&#x27; Nicholl believed that hospitalisation wasn&#x27;t necessary, and children were better cared from in their own home by their parents and by nurses making daily visits. Nicholl argued that &quot;separation from mother is often harmful&quot;.

During the interwar period, leading up to World War II, psychiatrists expressed concerns about children being away from parents, such as during hospitalisation. Harry Edelston, a Psychiatrist in Leeds, detailed that children were emotionally damaged by their stay in hospital.

In the post-war era, critiques became more widespread and studies were conducted to examine potential harms. René Spitz, an Austrian-American psychoanalyst, published an article in 1945 in which he noted deleterious effects of hospitalisation, based on his research with institutionalised children.

L.A. Perry wrote a 1947 Lancet article that protested the restrictions of parental visits on hospitalized children. However, Edelston wrote in 1948, that many of this colleagues still refused to believe in hospitalisation trauma Bowlby studied 44 juvenile thieves and found that a significantly high number had experienced early and traumatic separation from their mother. In 1949, he used the data to write a report for the World Health Organization&#x27;s on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe.

With the introduction of penicillin into the majority of the medical community by the 1940s, the major objection by doctors and nurses, that visits by parents into hospital wards introduced cross infections had been removed. A major review in 1949, over an 11-month period, showed that children admitted to 26 wards in 14 hospitals showed no correlation between visits and cross infection from parents to children. By that time, the working practices of doctors and nurses, still posed the main objection to visiting. A.D. Hunt reported that:The hospitalised child was considered essentially a biological unit, far better off without his parents who, on weekly or bi-weekly visiting hours, were fundamentally toxic in their effect, causing noise, generally disorderly conduct, and rejection by hospital personnel.British Psychiatrist John Bowlby, who had previously criticised World War II evacuation schemes separating parents and children, and his research assistant at the Tavistock Clinic, James Robertson, a Scottish social worker and psychoanalyst, researched the separation of young children from their parents during hospital stays and criticised the negative impacts on the children of policies of limited visiting.

By the 1950s, British politicians were concerned enough about the impact of children&#x27;s hospital policy to create a committee to research the welfare of sick children in hospital. This committee produced the Platt Report of 1959, recommending that children should have more access to their parents while ill. The Report had effects on hospital care of children in the UK and New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.

==Utilization in the United States==
Using hospital discharge data from 2003 to 2011, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) studied trends in aggregate hospital costs, average hospital costs, and hospital utilization. The Agency found that for children aged 0–17, aggregate costs rose rapidly for the surgical hospitalizations and decreased for injury hospitalizations. Further, average hospital costs, or cost per discharge, increased at least 2% for all hospitalizations and were expected to grow by at least 4% through 2013. The exception to this was mental health hospitalizations, which saw a lower percentage increase of 1.2%, and was projected to increase only 0.9% through 2013. Despite the rising aggregate costs and costs per discharge, hospitalizations (except for mental health hospitalizations) for children aged 0–17 decreased over the same time, and were projected to continue decreasing.

In 2006–2011, the rate of emergency department (ED) use in the United States was highest for patients aged under one year, but lowest for patients aged 1–17 years. The rate of ED use for patients aged under one year declined over the same time period; this was the only age group to see a decline.

Between 2008 and 2012, growth in mean hospital costs per stay in the United States was highest for patients aged 17 and younger. In 2012 there were nearly 5.9 million hospital stays for children in the United States, of which 3.9 million were neonatal stays and 104,700 were maternal stays for pregnant teens.

==Ranking==
Every year &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks the top children&#x27;s hospitals and pediatric specialties in the United States. For the year 2010–2011, eight hospitals ranked in all 10 pediatric specialties. The ranking system used by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; depends on a variety of factors. In past years (2007 was the 18th year of Pediatric Ranking), ranking of hospitals has been done solely on the basis of reputation, gauged by random sampling and surveying of pediatricians and pediatric specialists throughout the country. The ranking system used is currently under review.

<text>Kurt Elling (born November 2, 1967) is an American jazz singer and songwriter.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Rockford, Elling became interested in music through his father, who was Kapellmeister at a Lutheran church. He sang in choirs and played musical instruments. He encountered jazz while a student at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota. After college, he enrolled in the University of Chicago Divinity School, but he left one credit short of a degree to pursue a career as a jazz vocalist.

Elling began to perform around Chicago, scat singing and improvising his lyrics. He recorded a demo in the early 1990s and was signed by Blue Note. He has been nominated for ten Grammy Awards, winning Best Vocal Jazz Album for &quot;Dedicated to You&quot; (2009) and &quot;Secrets Are the Best Stories &quot;(2021). Elling often leads the &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine Critics&#x27; Poll. He had a longtime collaboration with pianist Laurence Hobgood, leading a quartet that toured throughout the world.

==Early life==
Elling was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 2, 1967, the son of Henry and Martha Elling. His interest in music started with his father, who was Kapellmeister at a Lutheran church. Elling attended elementary school at St. Paul Lutheran School in Rockford, and throughout his early years, he sang in choirs and played violin, French horn, piano, and drums. During his middle school years, Elling remembers watching Tony Bennett and the Woody Herman band on television and imagining what it would be like to sing with a band. Growing up, Elling sang in the classical style, learning counterpoint from the motets of Johann Sebastian Bach.

At Rockford Lutheran High School, in Rockford, Illinois, Elling continued to sing in the choir: &quot;When it was undeniably uncool and geeky and all that, to be in the choir, I did it anyway, because it was reliably beautiful, and it was rewarding, and it gave me gifts of experience and friendships.&quot; One of these experiences was that of singing the National Anthem with the high school madrigal choir, &quot;Joyful Sounds&quot; under the direction of Joyce Kortze in front of his first large crowd of over 40,000 people.

Elling attended Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, where he majored in history and minored in religion. In college, Elling sang in the 70-voice Gustavus Choir, an a cappella choir that performed works from a variety of different composers, allowing him to hone his technical skills. Elling also toured Europe with his college choir. He became interested in jazz at Gustavus Adolphus while listening to Dave Brubeck, Dexter Gordon, Herbie Hancock, and Ella Fitzgerald.

After graduating from Gustavus Adolphus in 1989, Elling enrolled in graduate school at the University of Chicago Divinity School where he studied for his master&#x27;s degree in philosophy of religion. He thought about continuing work in academia or working for the World Council of Churches when he graduated. He began playing jazz gigs once a week during graduate school, with one of his first shows at Milt Trenier&#x27;s, a basement club in Chicago (now defunct). He earned little money at these gigs, but Karl Johnson, the house pianist, was his mentor and teacher. Elling recalls, &quot;By day I was reading Kant and Schleiermacher, trying to get a handle on that, and at night I was sitting-in in clubs, and, of course, you can&#x27;t do both and be effective. Eventually Saturday night won out over Sunday morning.&quot; He remained a graduate student until January 1992, when he left school one credit short of graduation.

In Chicago, Elling worked as a bartender and as a mover. He sang at weddings in addition to clubs. At this time, he began singing in a scat style and improvising his own lyrics. Elling began listening to the vocalese of jazz singer Mark Murphy, who exposed him to the poetry of Jack Kerouac. The minimalism and emotion of Chet Baker&#x27;s music was also influential.

==Career==
While living in Chicago in 1995, Elling decided he was ready to record. He had met pianist Laurence Hobgood through Ed Petersen, who played the Green Mill on Monday nights. Elling convinced Hobgood that he was ready to go into the studio, and they came out with nine solid songs. Following the advice of pianist Fred Simon, the cassette recording was sent to Bill Traut, a manager in Los Angeles, who eventually gave it to Bruce Lundvall of Blue Note.

In 1995, Elling signed with Blue Note, and the songs on the demo became the Grammy nominated label debut, &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; (1995). The album features Edward Petersen and Von Freeman on tenor saxophone, Dave Onderdonk on guitar, Laurence Hobgood on piano, Eric Hochberg and Rob Amster on double bass, and Paul Wertico on drums. &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot; was followed by &quot;The Messenger&quot; (1997).
In 1999, Elling became a National Trustee for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and in 2003 he was elected vice-chair and served two terms.

In 2006, Elling performed on the television program &quot;Legends of Jazz&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Jazz Singers&quot;. Elling sang &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot; and performed a duet with Al Jarreau on &quot;Take Five&quot;. The recording was released on CD and DVD. In August of the same year, Elling signed a contract with Concord Jazz, and his first album with the label, &quot;Nightmoves&quot;, was released in 2007.

The follow-up, &quot;Dedicated to You: Kurt Elling Sings the Music of Coltrane and Hartman&quot; (2009), is a tribute to the 1963 recording &quot;John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman&quot;, widely recognized as one of the all-time finest jazz vocal albums. The album arose out of a 2005 concert commissioned by the Chicago Jazz Festival, showcasing the Coltrane-Hartman material. Later, Elling and pianist Laurence Hobgood rearranged the music, culminating in a performance in the Allen Room at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York. The concert was recorded in January 2009 and the album was released in June.

Elling is a baritone with a four-octave range, and a writer and performer of vocalese, writing and performing words over improvised jazz solos. In 2007, 2012 and 2020, Circumstantial Productions published three editions of &quot;Lyrics: Kurt Elling&quot;, collections of Elling&#x27;s vocalese lyrics edited by Richard Connolly.
==Collaborators==
Elling has performed and recorded with David Amram, Randy Bachman, Bob Belden, Joanne Brackeen, Oscar Brown Jr., Jodie Christian, Billy Corgan, Orbert Davis, George Freeman, Buddy Guy, Jon Hendricks, Charlie Hunter, Bob Mintzer, Brad Mehldau, Lee Ritenour, John Pizzarelli, and Bob Sheppard.

Until November 2013, Elling&#x27;s band included musical director Laurence Hobgood on piano, John McLean on guitar, Clark Sommers on bass, and drummer Kendrick Scott. Howard Reich&#x27;s wrote in his November 6, 2013 column &quot;My kind of Jazz&quot; in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, that Elling and Hobgood would be going separate ways. Hobgood linked to that article from his website. Elling&#x27;s website announced the change on November 12, 2013.

The band included a rotating series of pianists until October 2015 when Gary Versace became Kurt Elling&#x27;s first-call pianist and was added to the Band page on Elling&#x27;s website. Then in August 2016, Stu Mindeman took over as piano chair and Versace&#x27;s page was moved to Extended Family.

In 2016 he was a member of Branford Marsalis&#x27;s quartet. He toured with the band and performed on the album &quot;Upward Spiral&quot;, which was nominated for a Grammy Award. Marsalis co-produced Elling&#x27;s album &quot;The Questions&quot; and performed on three songs.

==Personal life==
In 1996, Elling married dancer Jennifer Carney. Their daughter Luiza was born in 2005. In the same year, the Ellings purchased a condominium from Barack Obama in Hyde Park, Chicago. The Ellings moved to New York in 2008.
