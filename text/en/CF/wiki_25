<text>Peter Cooper Hewitt (May 5, 1861 – August 25, 1921) was an American electrical engineer and inventor, who invented the first mercury-vapor lamp in 1901. Hewitt was issued on September 17, 1901. In 1903, Hewitt created an improved version that possessed higher color qualities which eventually found widespread industrial use.

==Early life==
Hewitt was born in New York City, the son of New York City Mayor Abram Hewitt and the grandson of industrialist Peter Cooper. He was educated at the Stevens Institute of Technology and the Columbia University School of Mines.

==Career==

In 1901, Hewitt invented and patented a mercury-vapor lamp that was the forerunner of the fluorescent lamp. A gas-discharge lamp, Hewitt&#x27;s invention used mercury vapor produced by passing current through liquid mercury. His first lamps had to be started by tilting the tube to make contact between the two electrodes and the liquid mercury; later he developed the inductive electrical ballast to start the tube. The efficiency was much higher than that of incandescent lamps, but the emitted light was of a bluish-green unpleasant color, which limited its practical use to specific professional areas, like photography, where the color was not an issue at a time where films were black and white. For space lighting use, the lamp was frequently augmented by a standard incandescent lamp. The two together provided a more acceptable color while retaining some efficiency advantages.

In 1902, Hewitt developed the mercury arc rectifier, the first rectifier that could convert alternating current power to direct current without mechanical means. It was widely used in electric railways, industry, electroplating, and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. Although it was largely replaced by power semiconductor devices in the 1970s and 1980s, it is still used in some high power applications.

In 1903, Columbia University awarded Hewitt the degree of Honorary Doctorate of Science in recognition of his work.

In 1907, he developed and tested an early hydrofoil. In 1916, Hewitt joined Elmer Sperry to develop the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, one of the first successful precursors of the cruise missile.

==Personal life==

Hewitt&#x27;s first wife was Lucy Bond Work. Work was the daughter of Franklin H. Work (1819–1911), a well-known stockbroker and protégé of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and his wife, Ellen Wood (1831–1877), who was the sister of Frances Ellen Work. Thus he was an uncle of Maurice Roche, 4th Baron Fermoy, the maternal grandfather of Diana, Princess of Wales. Cooper Hewitt and his first wife had no children and divorced in December 1918.

While married to Work, Hewitt had an extramarital relationship with Marion (aka Maryon) Jeanne Andrews that resulted in the birth of Ann Cooper Hewitt (July 28, 1914-1956). Hewitt later married Andrews in 1918, right after his divorce to Work, and formally adopted Ann.

Prior to Hewitt, Andrews was married in 1902 to Dr. Peder Sather Bruguiere (brother of American photographer Francis Bruguière, brother-in-law of heiress Margaret Post Van Alen and grandson of banker Peder Sather) and in 1907 to wealthy New York broker Alexander Turner &quot;Stewart&quot; Denning. 

After Hewitt, Andrews married in 1922 to Baron Robert Frederic Emile Regis D&#x27;Erlanger and in 1926 to George William Childs McCarter (grandson of American author Hannah Mary Bouvier Peterson, great-grandson of Judge John Bouvier and nephew-in-law of American publisher George William Childs).

===Ann Cooper Hewitt ===

Peter Cooper Hewitt died in 1921. His will left two-thirds of his estate to Ann and one-third to her mother Marion; but Ann&#x27;s portion would revert to her mother if Ann (Gay Bradstreet) died childless.

In 1935, just before Ann&#x27;s 21st birthday when she would have attained legal majority, she was hospitalized for appendicitis. Ann&#x27;s mother told the surgeons that Ann was &quot;feebleminded&quot; and paid them to sterilize her while performing her appendectomy. Ann retaliated by suing her mother in San Francisco court and telling the press about Maryon&#x27;s gambling and alcohol addictions. The mother-daughter dispute riveted the public; and the unconventional use of sterilization (it occurred in private practice, not a public asylum) forced a public debate of eugenics.

<text>Civic Holiday () is a public holiday in Canada celebrated on the first Monday in August.

Though the first Monday of August is celebrated in most of Canada as a public holiday, it is only officially known as &quot;Civic Holiday&quot; in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, where it is a territorial statutory holiday.

In other provinces and municipalities, the holiday is known by a variety of names, including British Columbia Day in British Columbia, New Brunswick Day in New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan Day in Saskatchewan; all of these places celebrate the date as a provincial statutory holiday. 

The holiday is celebrated as Heritage Day in Alberta; [[Natal Day]] in Nova Scotia, in commemoration of the founding of the Halifax–Dartmouth area; Natal Day on Prince Edward Island celebrating the birth of the province; and as Terry Fox Day in Manitoba, in honour of the Manitoba-born athlete.

The date is also celebrated as several municipal holidays in Ontario, such as Simcoe Day in Toronto, John Galt Day in Guelph, and Colonel By Day in Ottawa.

Despite its special designations, the day is not a statutory holiday in Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Alberta, or Ontario; however, it is commonly observed by all levels of government, financial institutions and some businesses.

The word &quot;civic&quot; is in reference to municipalities (such as cities, towns, etc.), as this day is not legislatively mandated a public holiday across the country by the Canadian federal government and is often given a different, more specific name by some municipalities or provinces.

==Alberta==
In 1974, the Government of Alberta, acting through Minister of Culture Horst A. Schmid, declared the first Monday in August an annual holiday to recognize and celebrate the varied cultural heritage of Albertans, known as &quot;Heritage Day&quot;. This gave rise in 1976 to the Edmonton Heritage Festival, a three-day celebration of food, dance, and handicrafts of cultures from around the world. Heritage Day is not a statutory holiday but is often celebrated as such.

==British Columbia==
In 1974, Surrey MLA Ernie Hall, part of the BC NDP government of Dave Barrett, introduced legislation in the provincial legislature to establish the day as a provincial statutory holiday.

As the name suggests, British Columbia Day, commonly referred to as &quot;BC Day&quot;, celebrates the history, heritage, and culture of British Columbia.

==Manitoba==
In Manitoba, the first Monday in August is celebrated as &quot;Terry Fox Day&quot; in honour of athlete and cancer research activist Terry Fox, who was born in Winnipeg in 1958.

The province marked the first Terry Fox Day on 3 August 2015, making Manitoba the first province to name a day in Fox&#x27;s honour. British Columbia and Ontario have since begun to celebrate &quot;Terry Fox Day&quot; on the second Sunday of September, as that is usually the national date for the Terry Fox Run.

==New Brunswick==
In New Brunswick, the first Monday in August is celebrated as &quot;New Brunswick Day&quot;.

It was first proposed in October 1974 by Progressive Conservative premier Richard Hatfield as part of his party&#x27;s re-election platform. It was first observed on Monday, 4 August 1975.

==Nova Scotia==
In Nova Scotia, the first Monday in August is celebrated as &quot;Natal Day&quot; in the Halifax–Dartmouth area and Annapolis Royal, which began in 1895 as a celebration of the province&#x27;s history. In the late 1900s, the rest of the province became entitled to celebrate a civic holiday, which falls on the same day as Natal Day. It is not a statutory holiday.

Dartmouth Natal Day Road Race, one of the longest running road races in North America, is part of the Natal Day festivities in the Halifax Regional Municipality.

==Ontario==
In Ontario, the first Monday of August is technically a municipal holiday, as it is not designated as an official statutory holiday by provincial legislation. Various private member&#x27;s bills have been introduced in the Ontario Legislature attempting to make it official, but none have passed to date. 

As such, the holiday takes on different names and celebrates different subjects according to municipality. Many Ontario municipalities have chosen to honour a significant local person or organization in order to localize the celebration; when not given a local name (such as in Mississauga), the day is often generically referred to as &quot;Civic Holiday&quot; or &quot;August Civic Holiday&quot;.

In 2008, the Ontario Legislature passed a law identifying the first of August as &quot;Emancipation Day&quot;, as the British Parliament abolished slavery in the British Empire as of 1 August 1834. This still did not make it an official holiday, however. The Toronto Caribbean Carnival, formerly known as Caribana, is held the same weekend in Toronto.

The Civic Holiday is now known by one of a number of local appellations, including, among others:

* &quot;Founders&#x27; Day&quot; in Brantford (named in 1982): each year, the Brantford Heritage Committee submits a report to City Council with the name or organization that is to be recognized on that day.
* &quot;Joseph Brant Day&quot; in Burlington: celebrating Joseph Brant, the Mohawk chief who became known for his treaty negotiations and loyalty to the British.
* &quot;James Cockburn Day&quot; in Cobourg (1999): celebrating James Cockburn, one of the &quot;fathers of Confederation&quot;.
* &quot;John Galt Day&quot; in Guelph (2006): celebrating John Galt, the Scottish novelist and businessman who founded the city.
* &quot;George Hamilton Day&quot; in Hamilton: celebrating George Hamilton, the eponymous founder of the city.
* &quot;McLaughlin Day&quot; in Oshawa (1983): celebrating Robert McLaughlin, who brought General Motors to Oshawa.
* &quot;Colonel By Day&quot; in Ottawa (1996): celebrating Colonel John By, who led the construction of the Rideau Canal and founded Bytown, which became the city of Ottawa.
* &quot;Peter Robinson Day&quot; in Peterborough: celebrating Peter Robinson.
* &quot;Alexander Mackenzie Day&quot; in Sarnia (1998): celebrating Alexander Mackenzie, the 2nd Prime Minister of Canada
* &quot;Simcoe Day&quot; in Toronto: celebrating John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada and the leading proponent of the &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot;.
* &quot;Benjamin Vaughan Day&quot; in Vaughan: celebrating the eponymous Benjamin Vaughan

Although a work holiday is given to employees of the federal, provincial, and many municipal governments (usually by inclusion in the contract with the employees&#x27; union), the Government of Ontario has not defined this day as a statutory holiday that all employers must treat as a holiday, and it is not mentioned in Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Employment Standards Act&quot; nor the &quot;Retail Business Holidays Act&quot;.

Schools are generally already closed, regardless of the holiday&#x27;s status, because of summer vacation. 

=== Simcoe Day ===
In 1869, the city of Toronto became the first to introduce the civic holiday when the Toronto City Council called for a midsummer holiday for a &quot;day of recreation&quot;. In 1875, the City Council fixed the first Monday in August as a Civic Holiday.

The holiday was renamed &quot;Simcoe Day&quot; in 1969 in honour of John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, who established York (now Toronto) as the capital of Ontario, and who was the leading proponent of the &quot;Act Against Slavery&quot;. However, a motion at the Ontario Municipal Association to extend the name change across Ontario failed. According to proclamations from the city, this name continues to apply in Toronto.

==Prince Edward Island==
The holiday is not an official holiday, although some businesses may close for the day. Additionally, federal workers receive the day off and federal services are closed, but municipal and provincial services and workers have varying decisions made on their status, with some choosing to have a day off in celebration of the Gold Cup Parade instead. This leads to a mix of openings and closings across the province. The capital city of Charlottetown has its own Natal Day, in early June, not to be confused with Nova Scotia&#x27;s Natal Day.

==Saskatchewan==
An official holiday on the first Monday in August was first proposed in Saskatchewan on 17 March 1975, by Gordon Snyder, Saskatchewan&#x27;s Minister of Labour. The holiday was already celebrated by businesses across Saskatchewan, but Snyder wanted it to be a recognized statutory holiday known as &quot;Saskatchewan Day&quot;. His proposal was approved in June of that year and the first Saskatchewan Day was celebrated that August.

The first Monday of August in Saskatchewan is therefore a statutory holiday as designated in the &quot;Labour Standards Act&quot;.

==Non-observing jurisdictions==
The first Monday in August is not generally observed as a holiday in Quebec, parts of Newfoundland and Labrador, or Yukon, but replacement summer holidays may be observed as follows:

* Quebec observes Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day on 24 June.
* In Yukon, Discovery Day is observed on the third Monday of August instead; it commemorates the 1896 discovery of gold in the territory and the start of the Klondike Gold Rush.
* In Newfoundland and Labrador, the &quot;Shops Closing Act&quot; provides for a civic holiday on the date of the Royal St. John&#x27;s Regatta (usually the first Wednesday of August) in St. John&#x27;s, the date of the Harbour Grace Regatta (usually the fourth Saturday in July) in Harbour Grace, and a date fixed by the applicable municipal council in all other municipalities. Several of these communities use the first Monday in August as a civic holiday; Corner Brook uses the third Monday in February (celebrated in most other provinces as Family Day), while others have not selected any date.
** Due to the cancellation of the Royal St. John&#x27;s Regatta in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the city made a one-time exception, with provincial approval, setting the first Monday of August that year as the civic holiday instead, in alignment with the other observing jurisdictions.

<text>The River Taff () is a river in Wales. It rises in the Brecon Beacons as two rivers, the Taf Fechan (&quot;little Taff&quot;) and the Taf Fawr (&quot;great Taff&quot;) before becoming one just north of Merthyr Tydfil. At Cardiff, it empties into the Bristol Channel.

The river supports several species of migratory fish, including salmon, sewins (sea trout), and eels.

==Course==
From its confluence at Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, the river flows south, passing several towns. It picks up a few tributaries, such as the River Cynon, River Rhondda, Bargoed Taf and Nant Clydach. It flows through Pontypridd and through to Taff&#x27;s Well, the site of Wales&#x27; only thermal spring. It flows underneath the M4 Motorway, before turning southeastward and flowing past the Cardiff suburbs of Radyr, Whitchurch, Llandaff, Pontcanna, the city centre and Grangetown, before emptying into Cardiff Bay, near to the mouth of the River Ely.

===Taf Fawr===
The Taf Fawr rises below the peak of Corn Du, south-west of Pen y Fan and soon flows in a generally southerly direction through a steep-sided valley, which was identified by Cardiff&#x27;s Borough Engineer John Avery Brandon Williams as the best source of water for the town when he assessed all possible sources of water for the newly formed Cardiff Corporation Waterworks in 1881. A bill was presented to Parliament in November 1883, and despite serious opposition from riparian landowners, Royal Assent was obtained for the Cardiff Corporation Act 1884 on 7 August. It allowed the corporation to build three reservoirs.

The catchment of the upper Taf Fawr was but it was split into an upper area of and a lower one of . Any works had to provide compensation water to maintain the flow in the Taf Fawr, and working on the upper area first meant that the Corporation only had to supply per day of compensation flow until work started on the lower area. Cantref Reservoir, the lower of the two in the upper area, was constructed first. Work began on 4 May 1886 and was completed on 14 September 1892. Construction of Beacons Reservoir, the highest in the chain, began shortly afterwards, in April 1893, in advance of the Corporation obtaining a second Act of Parliament to increase the capacity of the reservoir and to move the dam further upstream, where the foundations would be better, in the light of geological investigation. Impounding of the water began on 17 September 1897.

Construction of Llwyn-on Reservoir, the third in the chain, did not start until 1911, and again, its capacity was increased by an Act obtained in 1909 to , almost double that specified in 1884. Impounding of water began on 23 June 1926, and the reservoir was full by November, but formal commissioning did not take place until May 1927. Once built, it supplied of compensation water per day to maintain the flow in the river.

Below Llwyn-on, the river is crossed by the A470 Brecon to Merthyr road, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road, and as it passes to the south-west of Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, the Cefn Railway Viaduct. which consists of 15 arches built on a curve. It was to have been built of stone, but a masons strike in 1866 resulted in the Brecon and Merthyr Railway buying 800,000 bricks to complete it. It is grade II* listed as its history and architecture surpass that of most other railway viaducts in Wales. On the west bank are the remains of a leat, constructed in 1766 for the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. It is fed by a stone weir with a cast iron sluice. Parts of the leat are cut into solid rock, and parts have stone walls and buttresses. The river is joined by the Taf Fechan near Cyfarthfa Castle.

===Taf Fechan===

The Taf Fechan rises immediately to the south of Pen y Fan and runs southwards through three reservoirs and a former fourth, now abandoned. Whereas the Taf Fawr was the preserve of Cardiff Corporation, the Taf Fechan was used to supply water to Merthyr Tydfil Corporation. Of the Upper Neuadd and Lower Neuadd reservoirs, the lower one was built first, authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1876. Like those on the Taf Fawr, it had an earth embankment with a clay core. The clay had to be imported, and for this purpose a private branch line was built from the Brecon and Merthyr Tydfil Junction Railway near Torpantau railway station. The contract for the work was given to William Jones of Neath, and the project was completed in 1884. Now decommissioned, the water level when the reservoir was full was at above Ordnance Datum, and it held .

The Upper Neuadd Reservoir was rather larger, and was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1895. The dam which is high was constructed of masonry, and some 100,000 tons were carried along an extended railway to the construction site. Although the contractors Holme and King of Liverpool were employed to do much of the preparatory work, the building of the dam was carried out by direct labour, with Merthyr Corporation&#x27;s surveyor, Thomas F Harvey, acting as resident engineer. Work began in 1896 and finished in 1902. It held , and with a water level at , it was one of a very small number of artificial lakes built above the contour. The dam had a small tower to the west, and a larger one to the east, below which a tunnel outlet built in Piranesi style sat at the base of the dam. Neuadd House, built as part of the reservoir project in 1896, is just downstream from the dam. An octagonal building at the east side of the Lower Neuadd dam is also a listed structure.

The river continues southwards through a steep-sided wooded valley and is crossed by Pont Cwmyfedwen, an early- to mid-19th century single span bridge before it reaches Pentwyn Reservoir, the oldest of the four reservoirs. It was built by the Merthyr Board of Health between 1859 and February 1863, and the consulting engineer for the project was Thomas Hawksley, but despite this, the dam was built over a geological fault, which led to large volumes of leakage. This leakage was one of the main factors that led to the construction of the Lower Neuadd Reservoir. Remedial work was carried out at regular intervals, but never seemed to last for long. Repairs undertaken in 1912/13 reduced the level of leakage from which was sufficient until Pontsticill Reservoir could be built to impound the leaking water. The corporation had obtained the Act of Parliament to authorise it in 1911, and awarded a contract to Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons on 16 June 1913. The contract price of £232,000 included various ancillary work including diverting the roads on both sides of the valley. The top of the earth dam was above the valley floor, and the reservoir was designed to hold , although this was subsequently increased a little by raising the water level by . Completion was delayed by the onset of the First World War, and when work resumed in 1922, the Corporation used direct labour. The Taf Fechan Water Supply Act had been passed in 1921, creating the Taf Fechan Water Supply Board, uniting the Rhymney Valley Water Board, the Pontypridd and Rhondda Joint Water Board, the Urban District Councils of Aberdare and Llantrisant &amp; Llantwit Fardre, and Merthyr Tydfil Corporation. The reservoir was opened by Lord Buckland of Bwlch on 21 July 1927.

The valve tower is octagonal and built in Gothic style, with a copper-covered spire. The outflow is a large funnel with convex sides and concrete ribs. Both are grade II listed, together with the dam and a lattice steel bridge. The filter house, with its twelve rapid gravity filter beds, which have been little altered since 1923, is also listed, as are the turbine house, which controlled how much water flowed over the weir, and the compensation basin below that, which is used to regulate the flow in the Taf Fechan below the reservoir. Below the works is Pont Sticill, a single span bridge with a datestone showing it was built in 1825, which gives its name to the village.

Below Pontsticill the river forms the boundary of the Brecon Beacons National Park and descends into a wooded gorge, where it is crossed by the seven-arched Pontsarn Viaduct built for the Brecon and Merthyr Railway in 1866. It is high and long. Just to the south of the viaduct is Pont-sarn, a stone bridge built in 1864 after the previous wooden one collapsed. This occurred because the parishes of Merthyr and Vaynor were supposed to maintain it jointly, but could not agree, and so it became dilapidated. There were proposals to widen it in 1955, but the plans were withdrawn when there was stiff opposition from local people. Below the bridge, the river plunges into Pwll Glas or the Blue Pool. The river continues to flow south-westwards around the hamlet of Trefechan, and as it approaches Cefn-coed-y-cymmer, there is a tramway and leat on the east bank. The tramway was built in 1792, and was used to carry limestone to the Cyfarthfa Ironworks from Gurnos quarries, while the leat was constructed in 1825. Its main function was to provide the ironworks with a good supply of water, but it also fed the ornamental lake at Cyfarthfa Castle through a syphon. After passing under the A465 and the A4054 roads, the Taf Fechan merges with the Taf Fawr at the wooded confluence that gives Cefn-coed-y-cymmer its name.

The river holds a large population of wild brown trout, many of which were killed in 2006 when three tonnes of aluminium sulphate spilled into the river from the Pontsticill Water Treatment Works, which United Utilities operate on behalf of Dwr Cymru Welsh Water. The pollution turned the water white for at least downstream of the works and killed approximately 23,000 fish, including wild brown trout, bullheads, stickleback and pike, and a large number of invertebrates. Environment Agency Wales estimated that the river would take six to twelve years to recover. The trout population had resumed breeding by 2009.

===Below the confluence===
Just below the confluence of the Taf Fawr and Taf Fechan, the river is crossed by the Pont-y-Cafnau tramroad bridge. This was probably the first iron railway bridge to be built, and was unusual in that it had three levels. The main deck carried the -gauge Gurnos Tramway, beneath which there was an iron trough to carry water from the Taf Fechan leat, while a second water supply was carried in a wooden launder above the tramway tracks. The cast iron structure was manufactured at the Cyfarthfa Ironworks. On the west bank of the river are the remains of the ironworks, which began operating in 1765. The artifacts include seven blast furnaces, which formed part of the largest ironworks in the world in its heyday. The river runs through the western edges of Merthyr Tydfil, where it is crossed by modern bridges carrying the A4054 and A4102 roads, and by Jackson&#x27;s Bridge, an early 19th century single span structure that carried the Dowlais tramway and a road.

Two modern bridges in central Merthyr Tydfil carry the northbound carriageway of the A4054 across the river to its west bank and back again, with a weir between them. Nant Rhyd-y-car joins on the west bank at Cae-draw, just before the A4102 crosses. As it approaches Abercanaid Industrial Estate, the railway from Merthyr Tydfil railway station joins the east bank of the river and runs parallel to it for much of its length. It curves around the eastern edge of Abercanaid, below which it is crossed by the A4060 road bridge. At Troed-y-rhiw the B4285 Bridge Street crosses, and the Afon Tâf High School if located on the east bank. A little further south, Ynysowen Community Primary School is on the west bank and the river curves around the eastern edge of Aberfan, part of the Merthyr Vale community. Below Aberfan, the river enters a wooded section, and the remains of the Merthyr Tramroad are sandwiched between the river and the modern railway. The Merthyr or Penydarren Tramroad was built in 1793, and was the scene of the first passenger carrying train journey in the world, when Richard Trevithick&#x27;s high pressure steam locomotive pulled wagons containing 5 tons of iron ore and seventy passengers in 1804. The tramway ceased operation around 1880, and this section, which is a scheduled monument, is particularly well preserved.

The river is crossed by an old farm access bridge at Pont y Gwaith, with a single span of and a width of . It carries a date plaque stating it was built in 1811, but that probably refers to an earlier wooden bridge, and the main arch was rebuilt in 1993. The river turns to the east to flow around the southern edge of Treharris, and then in a large loop around higher ground on which is Goitre-Coed. Three listed bridges cross the loop. The first was built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1840–41, and consists of six arches on a slight curve. It carried the single track Taff Vale Railway, but was doubled in width within 20 years, to enable it to carry twin tracks. The second was part of the Merthyr Tramroad, and was built in 1815 after the original wooden bridge collapsed into the river when a train crossed it. It has a span of and is one of the earliest railway bridges, but was in poor condition in 2002, as is the Victoria Bridge, which was also rebuilt in 1815.

Continuing to the south-west, the river is crossed by the A472 and A470 roads, and at Abercynon is crossed by the B4275 road. Immediately to the south of the bridge was an aqueduct carrying the defunct Glamorganshire Canal over the river. The Afon Cynon joins on the right bank, and close to the junction is spanned by a skewed railway bridge with two arches of unequal sizes. The valley then widens, and the river begins to meander. On the northern edge of Glyncoch, the river is joined by the Nant Clydach on its right bank, and to the south of the settlement is crossed by a three-bay girder viaduct, built in 1885 to carry a branch of the Taff Vale Railway over the river to Albion Colliery at Cilfynydd. Just to the south is White or Berw Bridge, designed by Pontypridd Urban District Council&#x27;s surveyor, P R A Willoughby. It was built in 1907, aided by L G Mouchel &amp; Partners, who pioneered the use of reinforced concrete, and the span over the river was the longest arch in Britain using this material when it was constructed. The next crossing is Pontypridd Bridge, a high-arched single span of . It was built in 1756 by an Independent minister and self-taught civil engineer called William Edwards, and was his third attempt, after his two earlier bridges collapsed. It features three round openings in its spandrels, a device he used to relieve the pressure on an unusually wide arch. It was repaired by Edward David and Thomas Evan in 1798, and is attached to the newer Victoria Bridge on its south side.

On the east bank is Ynysangharad Park, where there is an Arts and Crafts lido, designed in the 1920s and opened in 1923. It is now disused, but is grade II listed, as it is one of the earliest outdoor lidos in South Wales. On the west bank, the river is joined by the Afon Rhondda, before it sweeps to the east in a large bend. The A4058 dual carriageway crosses the bend at an angle, and as the river resumes its southward course, it is crossed by Machine Bridge, which is also known as Pont y Doctor, as it was built by Dr Richard Griffiths in 1809, as part of a tramway to carry coal from the Hafod Uchaf pit to the Glamorganshire Canal. It has three arches, and was widened around 1910, in an early use of reinforced concrete. Some of the 19th century fabric remains, and is thought to be the earliest multi-span railway bridge still in existence in the world. Two more modern road bridges are located on its south side, and further downstream is Castle Bridge, a narrow structure with three arches dating from the early 19th century. It formerly carried a road, but is now only used by pedestrians. Next there is a large, crescent-shaped weir, which was built in 1834–5 to provide water power to the Treforest tinplate works. The sluice to control the flow of water to the works is at the western end of the weir, and probably dates from a little later. The works continued in operation until 1939, and a fish ladder was added in 2003, to allow migrating fish to access the upper river. Many of the building still exist, some distance to the south of the weir, including a casting house, a workshop, a tinning house, a smithy, a rolling mill, and the retaining wall for the leat. The leat had seven sluices with gates to feed the works, but all have been bricked up.

===Diversion in Cardiff===
In the early 1840s the South Wales Railway was trying to find a suitable site for a railway station, but the area that is now Cardiff Central railway station was prone to flooding. At this point the main route of the Taff was around Cardiff Castle and down what is now Westgate Street, with the lands where Cardiff Arms Park and the Millennium Stadium are now sited tidal flats which were prone to flood.

Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s solution was to divert the Taff to the west, creating a larger and safer site for the station. The station was opened by the South Wales Railway in 1850.

==Tributaries==
===Nant Ffrwd===

Underneath the Cefn Coed Viaduct, the Nant Ffrwd, a tributary that runs eastward in a deep wooded gorge before flowing into the Taf Fawr above the confluence with the Taf Fechan, emerges into the river from a deep, narrow gorge.

===Nant Morlais and Nant Rhydycar===
The Taff continues south through the centre of Merthyr Tydfil, where it is joined by the Nant Morlais which emerges at Abermorlais from a culvert in the east bank. Just south of Merthyr weir, the Nant Rhydycar joins.

===Taff Bargoed, Cynon, Nant Clydach and Rhondda===
South of Merthyr, the Taff begins to meander its way between Pentrebach and Abercanaid and through Troed-y-rhiw, Merthyr Vale and Aberfan towards Quakers Yard. Here, the Taff Bargoed, Nant Mafon and then down into Abercynon in the Cynon Valley where the Afon Cynon merge with the Taff and, slightly further downstream the Nant Clydach joins. At Pontypridd it is joined by the Afon Rhondda. From Pontypridd, it runs roughly south before arriving at the northern boundary of the city of Cardiff.

==Mouth of the Taff==

In Cardiff, the natural course of the river was changed during the 19th century; from Cardiff Castle it now follows an artificial riverbed west of where it previously flowed, following a path through Bute Park, past the Cardiff Arms Park and the Principality Stadium. The Taff flows into Cardiff Bay, an artificial lake created by the construction of the Cardiff Bay Barrage in the 1990s, before flowing into the Severn Estuary.

<text>Infini-D is a discontinued 3D computer graphics program developed by Specular International. It was continued up to version 4.5 by MetaCreations when Specular merged with it. It combined with Ray Dream Studio to create Carrara. Soon after, Metacreations divested itself of all products other than MetaStream, including selling Carrara to Eovia. It was sold to the current developer, DAZ, upon Eovia&#x27;s breaking up.

Infini-D is a diverse package, useful for creating print, web, and video media. It spawned LogoMotion, a basic 3D application like Adobe Dimensions aimed at print and multimedia users. It has a friendly interface, and the ability to queue and distribute render jobs to a render farm, freeing the artist&#x27;s computer for other tasks. Distributed Rendering was initially handled through a separate program, BackBurner, but it was incorporated into Infini-D 4. Infini-D was especially popular in the Macintosh market.

<text>A bird nest is the spot in which a bird lays and incubates its eggs and raises its young. Although the term popularly refers to a specific structure made by the bird itself—such as the grassy cup nest of the American robin or Eurasian blackbird, or the elaborately woven hanging nest of the Montezuma oropendola or the village weaver—that is too restrictive a definition. For some species, a nest is simply a shallow depression made in sand; for others, it is the knot-hole left by a broken branch, a burrow dug into the ground, a chamber drilled into a tree, an enormous rotting pile of vegetation and earth, a shelf made of dried saliva or a mud dome with an entrance tunnel. The smallest bird nests are those of some hummingbirds, tiny cups which can be a mere across and high. At the other extreme, some nest mounds built by the dusky scrubfowl measure more than in diameter and stand nearly tall. The study of birds&#x27; nests is known as &quot;caliology&quot;.

Not all bird species build nests. Some species lay their eggs directly on the ground or rocky ledges, while brood parasites lay theirs in the nests of other birds, letting unwitting &quot;foster parents&quot; do the work of rearing the young. Although nests are primarily used for breeding, they may also be reused in the non-breeding season for roosting and some species build special &quot;dormitory nests&quot; or &quot;roost nests&quot; (or &quot;winter-nest&quot;) that are used only for roosting. Most birds build a new nest each year, though some refurbish their old nests. The large eyries (or aeries) of some eagles are platform nests that have been used and refurbished for several years.

In the majority of nest-building species the female does most or all of the nest construction, in others both partners contribute; sometimes the male builds the nest and the hen lines it. In some polygynous species, however, the male does most or all of the nest building. The nest may also form a part of the courtship display such as in weaver birds. The ability to choose and maintain good nest sites and build high quality nests may be selected for by females in these species. In some species the young from previous broods may also act as helpers for the adults.

== Type ==

Not every bird species builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including common murre, thick-billed murre and razorbill—lay their eggs directly onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites. The eggs of these species are dramatically pointed at one end, so that they roll in a circle when disturbed. This is critical for the survival of the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling off the side of the cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other abiotic factors.

King penguins and emperor penguins also do not build nests; instead, they tuck their eggs and chicks between their feet and folds of skin on their lower bellies. They are thus able to move about while incubating, though in practice only the emperor penguin regularly does so. Emperor penguins breed during the harshest months of the Antarctic winter, and their mobility allows them to form huge huddled masses which help them to withstand the extremely high winds and low temperatures of the season. Without the ability to share body heat (temperatures in the centre of tight groups can be as much as 10C above the ambient air temperature), the penguins would expend far more energy trying to stay warm, and breeding attempts would probably fail.

Some crevice-nesting species, including ashy storm-petrel, pigeon guillemot, Eurasian eagle-owl and Hume&#x27;s tawny owl, lay their eggs in the relative shelter of a crevice in the rocks or a gap between boulders, but provide no additional nest material. Potoos lay their single egg directly atop a broken stump, or into a shallow depression on a branch—typically where an upward-pointing branch died and fell off, leaving a small scar or knot-hole. Brood parasites, such as the New World cowbirds, the honeyguides, and many of the Old World and Australasian cuckoos, lay their eggs in the active nests of other species.

=== Scrape ===

The simplest nest construction is the &quot;scrape&quot;, which is merely a shallow depression in soil or vegetation. This nest type, which typically has a rim deep enough to keep the eggs from rolling away, is sometimes lined with bits of vegetation, small stones, shell fragments or feathers. These materials may help to camouflage the eggs or may provide some level of insulation; they may also help to keep the eggs in place, and prevent them from sinking into muddy or sandy soil if the nest is accidentally flooded. Ostriches, most tinamous, many ducks, most shorebirds, most terns, some falcons, pheasants, quail, partridges, bustards and sandgrouse are among the species that build scrape nests.

Eggs and young in scrape nests, and the adults that brood them, are more exposed to predators and the elements than those in more sheltered nests; they are on the ground and typically in the open, with little to hide them. The eggs of most ground-nesting birds (including those that use scrape nests) are cryptically coloured to help camouflage them when the adult is not covering them; the actual colour generally corresponds to the substrate on which they are laid. Brooding adults also tend to be well camouflaged, and may be difficult to flush from the nest. Most ground-nesting species have well-developed distraction displays, which are used to draw (or drive) potential predators from the area around the nest. Most species with this type of nest have precocial young, which quickly leave the nest upon hatching.

In cool climates (such as in the high Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be critical to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough that they and the parent bird are not too exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises to mere centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on the ground beside the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.
In warm climates, such as deserts and salt flats, heat rather than cold can kill the developing embryos. In such places, scrapes are shallower and tend to be lined with non-vegetative material (including shells, feathers, sticks and soil), which allows convective cooling to occur as air moves over the eggs. Some species, such as the lesser nighthawk and the red-tailed tropicbird, help reduce the nest&#x27;s temperature by placing it in partial or full shade. Others, including some shorebirds, cast shade with their bodies as they stand over their eggs. Some shorebirds also soak their breast feathers with water and then sit on the eggs, providing moisture to enable evaporative cooling. Parent birds keep from overheating themselves by gular panting while they are incubating, frequently exchanging incubation duties, and standing in water when they are not incubating.

The technique used to construct a scrape nest varies slightly depending on the species. Beach-nesting terns, for instance, fashion their nests by rocking their bodies on the sand in the place they have chosen to site their nest, while skimmers build their scrapes with their feet, kicking sand backwards while resting on their bellies and turning slowly in circles. The ostrich also scratches out its scrape with its feet, though it stands while doing so. Many tinamous lay their eggs on a shallow mat of dead leaves they have collected and placed under bushes or between the root buttresses of trees, and kagus lay theirs on a pile of dead leaves against a log, tree trunk or vegetation. Marbled godwits stomp a grassy area flat with their feet, then lay their eggs, while other grass-nesting waders bend vegetation over their nests so as to avoid detection from above. Many female ducks, particularly in the northern latitudes, line their shallow scrape nests with down feathers plucked from their own breasts, as well as with small amounts of vegetation. Among scrape-nesting birds, the three-banded courser and Egyptian plover are unique in their habit of partially burying their eggs in the sand of their scrapes.

=== Mound ===
Burying eggs as a form of incubation reaches its zenith with the Australasian megapodes. Several megapode species construct enormous &quot;mound&quot; nests made of soil, branches, sticks, twigs and leaves, and lay their eggs within the rotting mass. The heat generated by these mounds, which are in effect giant compost heaps, warms and incubates the eggs. The nest heat results from the respiration of thermophilic fungi and other microorganisms. The size of some of these mounds can be truly staggering; several of the largest—which contain more than of material, and probably weigh more than 50 tons (45,000 kg)—were initially thought to be Aboriginal middens.

In most mound-building species, males do most or all of the nest construction and maintenance. Using his strong legs and feet, the male scrapes together material from the area around his chosen nest site, gradually building a conical or bell-shaped pile. This process can take five to seven hours a day for more than a month. While mounds are typically reused for multiple breeding seasons, new material must be added each year to generate the appropriate amount of heat. A female will begin to lay eggs in the nest only when the mound&#x27;s temperature has reached an optimal level.

Both the temperature and the moisture content of the mound are critical to the survival and development of the eggs, so both are carefully regulated for the entire length of the breeding season (which may last for as long as eight months), principally by the male. Ornithologists believe that megapodes may use sensitive areas in their mouths to assess mound temperatures; each day during the breeding season, the male digs a pit into his mound and sticks his head in. If the mound&#x27;s core temperature is a bit low, he adds fresh moist material to the mound, and stirs it in; if it is too high, he opens the top of the mound to allow some of the excess heat to escape. This regular monitoring also keeps the mound&#x27;s material from becoming compacted, which would inhibit oxygen diffusion to the eggs and make it more difficult for the chicks to emerge after hatching. The malleefowl, which lives in more open forest than do other megapodes, uses the sun to help warm its nest as well—opening the mound at midday during the cool spring and autumn months to expose the plentiful sand incorporated into the nest to the sun&#x27;s warming rays, then using that warm sand to insulate the eggs during the cold nights. During hot summer months, the malleefowl opens its nest mound only in the cool early morning hours, allowing excess heat to escape before recovering the mound completely. One recent study showed that the sex ratio of Australian brushturkey hatchlings correlated strongly with mound temperatures; females hatched from eggs incubated at higher mean temperatures.

Flamingos make a different type of mound nest. Using their beaks to pull material towards them, they fashion a cone-shaped pile of mud between tall, with a small depression in the top to house their single egg. The height of the nest varies with the substrate upon which it is built; those on clay sites are taller on average than those on dry or sandy sites. The height of the nest and the circular, often water-filled trench which surrounds it (the result of the removal of material for the nest) help to protect the egg from fluctuating water levels and excessive heat at ground level. In East Africa, for example, temperatures at the top of the nest mound average some cooler than those of the surrounding ground.

The base of the horned coot&#x27;s enormous nest is a mound built of stones, gathered one at a time by the pair, using their beaks. These stones, which may weigh as much as 450 g (about a pound) each, are dropped into the shallow water of a lake, making a cone-shaped pile which can measure as much as at the bottom and at the top, and in height. The total combined weight of the mound&#x27;s stones may approach 1.5 tons (1,400 kg). Once the mound has been completed, a sizable platform of aquatic vegetation is constructed on top. The entire structure is typically reused for many years.

=== Burrow ===

Soil plays a different role in the &quot;burrow&quot; nest; here, the eggs and young—and in most cases the incubating parent bird—are sheltered under the earth. Most burrow-nesting birds excavate their own burrows, but some use those excavated by other species and are known as secondary nesters; burrowing owls, for example, sometimes use the burrows of prairie dogs, ground squirrels, badgers or tortoises, China&#x27;s endemic white-browed tits use the holes of ground-nesting rodents and common kingfishers occasionally nest in rabbit burrows. Burrow nests are particularly common among seabirds at high latitudes, as they provide protection against both cold temperatures and predators. Puffins, shearwaters, some megapodes, motmots, todies, most kingfishers, the crab plover, miners and leaftossers are among the species which use burrow nests.

Most burrow nesting species dig a horizontal tunnel into a vertical (or nearly vertical) dirt cliff, with a chamber at the tunnel&#x27;s end to house the eggs. The length of the tunnel varies depending on the substrate and the species; sand martins make relatively short tunnels ranging from , for example, while those of the burrowing parakeet can extend for more than three meters (nearly 10 ft). Some species, including the ground-nesting puffbirds, prefer flat or gently sloping land, digging their entrance tunnels into the ground at an angle. In a more extreme example, the D&#x27;Arnaud&#x27;s barbet digs a vertical tunnel shaft more than a meter (39 in) deep, with its nest chamber excavated off to the side at some height above the shaft&#x27;s bottom; this arrangement helps to keep the nest from being flooded during heavy rain. Buff-breasted paradise-kingfishers dig their nests into the compacted mud of active termite mounds, either on the ground or in trees. Specific soil types may favour certain species and it is speculated that several species of bee-eater favor loess soils which are easy to penetrate.

Birds use a combination of their beaks and feet to excavate burrow nests. The tunnel is started with the beak; the bird either probes at the ground to create a depression, or flies toward its chosen nest site on a cliff wall and hits it with its bill. The latter method is not without its dangers; there are reports of kingfishers being fatally injured in such attempts. Some birds remove tunnel material with their bills, while others use their bodies or shovel the dirt out with one or both feet. Female paradise-kingfishers are known to use their long tails to clear the loose soil.

Some crepuscular petrels and prions are able to identify their own burrows within dense colonies by smell. Sand martins learn the location of their nest within a colony, and will accept any chick put into that nest until right before the young fledge.

Not all burrow-nesting species incubate their young directly. Some megapode species bury their eggs in sandy pits dug where sunlight, subterranean volcanic activity, or decaying tree roots will warm the eggs. The crab plover also uses a burrow nest, the warmth of which allows it to leave the eggs unattended for as long as 58 hours.

Predation levels on some burrow-nesting species can be quite high; on Alaska&#x27;s Wooded Islands, for example, river otters munched their way through some 23 percent of the island&#x27;s fork-tailed storm-petrel population during a single breeding season in 1977. There is some evidence that increased vulnerability may lead some burrow-nesting species to form colonies, or to nest closer to rival pairs in areas of high predation than they might otherwise do.

=== Cavity ===
The &quot;cavity&quot; nest is a chamber, typically in living or dead wood, but sometimes in the trunks of tree ferns or large cacti, including saguaro. In tropical areas, cavities are sometimes excavated in arboreal insect nests. A relatively small number of species, including woodpeckers, trogons, some nuthatches and many barbets, can excavate their own cavities. Far more species—including parrots, tits, bluebirds, most hornbills, some kingfishers, some owls, some ducks and some flycatchers—use natural cavities, or those abandoned by species able to excavate them; they also sometimes usurp cavity nests from their excavating owners. Those species that excavate their own cavities are known as &quot;primary cavity nesters&quot;, while those that use natural cavities or those excavated by other species are called &quot;secondary cavity nesters&quot;. Both primary and secondary cavity nesters can be enticed to use nest boxes (also known as bird houses); these mimic natural cavities, and can be critical to the survival of species in areas where natural cavities are lacking.

Woodpeckers use their chisel-like bills to excavate their cavity nests, a process which takes, on average, about two weeks. Cavities are normally excavated on the downward-facing side of a branch, presumably to make it more difficult for predators to access the nest, and to reduce the chance that rain floods the nest. There is also some evidence that fungal rot may make the wood on the underside of leaning trunks and branches easier to excavate. Most woodpeckers use a cavity for only a single year. The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker is an exception; it takes far longer—up to two years—to excavate its nest cavity, and may reuse it for more than two decades. The typical woodpecker nest has a short horizontal tunnel which leads to a vertical chamber within the trunk. The size and shape of the chamber depends on species, and the entrance hole is typically only as large as is needed to allow access for the adult birds. While wood chips are removed during the excavation process, most species line the floor of the cavity with a fresh bed of them before laying their eggs.

Trogons excavate their nests by chewing cavities into very soft dead wood; some species make completely enclosed chambers (accessed by upward-slanting entrance tunnels), while others—like the extravagantly plumed resplendent quetzal—construct more open niches. In most trogon species, both sexes help with nest construction. The process may take several months, and a single pair may start several excavations before finding a tree or stump with wood of the right consistency.

Species which use natural cavities or old woodpecker nests sometimes line the cavity with soft material such as grass, moss, lichen, feathers or fur. Though a number of studies have attempted to determine whether secondary cavity nesters preferentially choose cavities with entrance holes facing certain directions, the results remain inconclusive. While some species appear to preferentially choose holes with certain orientations, studies (to date) have not shown consistent differences in fledging rates between nests oriented in different directions.

Cavity-dwelling species have to contend with the danger of predators accessing their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. They have a variety of methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. Red-cockaded woodpeckers peel bark around the entrance, and drill wells above and below the hole; since they nest in live trees, the resulting flow of resin forms a barrier that prevents snakes from reaching the nests. Red-breasted nuthatches smear sap around the entrance holes to their nests, while white-breasted nuthatches rub foul-smelling insects around theirs. Eurasian nuthatches wall up part of their entrance holes with mud, decreasing the size and sometimes extending the tunnel part of the chamber. Most female hornbills seal themselves into their cavity nests, using a combination of mud (in some species brought by their mates), food remains and their own droppings to reduce the entrance hole to a narrow slit.

A few birds are known to use the nests of insects within which they create a cavity in which they lay their eggs. These include the rufous woodpecker which nests in the arboreal nests of &quot;Crematogaster&quot; ants and the collared kingfisher which uses termite nests.

In December 2024, scientists reported that birds that build their nests in cavities are more than six times more likely to incorporate snakeskin into their nests than those which build cup-shaped nests. The same study found that the snake skin helped deter predators from eggs during their incubation period.

=== Cup ===
The &quot;cup&quot; nest is smoothly hemispherical inside, with a deep depression to house the eggs. Most are made of pliable materials—including grasses—though a small number are made of mud or saliva. Many passerines and a few non-passerines, including some hummingbirds and some swifts, build this type of nest.
Small bird species in more than 20 passerine families, and a few non-passerines—including most hummingbirds, kinglets and crests in the genus &quot;Regulus&quot;, some tyrant flycatchers and several New World warblers—use considerable amounts of spider silk in the construction of their nests. The lightweight material is strong and extremely flexible, allowing the nest to mold to the adult during incubation (reducing heat loss), then to stretch to accommodate the growing nestlings; as it is sticky, it also helps to bind the nest to the branch or leaf to which it is attached.

Many swifts and some hummingbirds use thick, quick-drying saliva to anchor their nests. The chimney swift starts by dabbing two globs of saliva onto the wall of a chimney or tree trunk. In flight, it breaks a small twig from a tree and presses it into the saliva, angling the twig downwards so that the central part of the nest is the lowest. It continues adding globs of saliva and twigs until it has made a crescent-shaped cup.

Cup-shaped nest insulation has been found to be related to nest mass, nest wall thickness, nest depth, nest weave density/porosity, surface area, height above ground and elevation above sea level.
More recently, nest insulation has been found to be related to the mass of the incubating parent. This is known as an allometric relationship. Nest walls are constructed with an adequate quantity of nesting material so that the nest will be capable of supporting the contents of the nest. Nest thickness, nest mass and nest dimensions therefore correlate with the mass of the adult bird. The flow-on consequence of this is that nest insulation is also related to parent mass.
=== Saucer or plate ===

The &quot;saucer&quot; or &quot;plate&quot; nest, though superficially similar to a cup nest, has at most only a shallow depression to house the eggs.

=== Platform ===

The &quot;platform&quot; nest is a large structure, often many times the size of the (typically large) bird which has built it. Depending on the species, these nests can be on the ground or elevated.
In the case of raptor nests, or &quot;eyries&quot; (also spelled &quot;aerie&quot;), these are often used for many years, with new material added each breeding season. In some cases, the nests grow large enough to cause structural damage to the tree itself, particularly during bad storms where the weight of the nest can cause additional stress on wind-tossed branches.

=== Pendent ===
The &quot;pendent&quot; nest is an elongated sac woven of pliable materials such as grasses and plant fibers and suspended from a branch. Oropendolas, caciques, orioles, weavers and sunbirds are among the species that weave pendent nests. In weaver birds, this is pendant, suspended from a single point hanging from branch while many other birds incorporate more than one branch to support the nest.

=== Sphere ===

The &quot;sphere&quot; nest is a roundish structure; it is completely enclosed, except for a small opening which allows access. Most spherical nests are woven out of plant material. Spider webs are also frequently used, upon which other material such as lichens may be stuck for camouflage. The cape penduline tit incorporates false entrances, the parent bird carefully making sure to close the actual entrance when leaving the nest. The entrances are lined with spider webs which help seal the openings.

==Nest protection and sanitation==

Many species of bird conceal their nests to protect them from predators. Some species may choose nest sites that are inaccessible or build the nest so as to deter predators. Bird nests can also act as habitats for other inquiline species which may not affect the bird directly. Birds have also evolved nest sanitation measures to reduce the effects of parasites and pathogens on nestlings.

Some aquatic species such as grebes are very careful when approaching and leaving the nest so as not to reveal the location. Some species will use leaves to cover up the nest prior to leaving.

Ground birds such as plovers may use &quot;broken wing&quot; or &quot;rodent run&quot; displays to distract predators from nests.

Many species attack predators or apparent predators near their nests. Kingbirds attack other birds that come too close. In North America, northern mockingbirds, blue jays, and Arctic terns can peck hard enough to draw blood. In Australia, a bird attacking a person near its nest is said to &quot;swoop&quot; the person. The Australian magpie is particularly well known for this behavior.

Nests can become home to many other organisms including parasites and pathogens. The excreta of the fledglings also pose a problem. In most passerines, the adults actively dispose the fecal sacs of young at a distance or consume them. This is believed to help prevent ground predators from detecting nests. Young birds of prey however usually void their excreta beyond the rims of their nests. Blowflies of the genus &quot;Protocalliphora&quot; have specialized to become obligate nest parasites with the maggots feeding on the blood of nestlings.

Some birds have been shown to choose aromatic green plant material for constructing nests that may have insecticidal properties, while others may use materials such as carnivore scat to repel smaller predators. Some urban birds, house sparrows and house finches in Mexico, have adopted the use of cigarette butts which contain nicotine and other toxic substances that repel ticks and other ectoparasites.

Some birds use pieces of snake slough in their nests. It has been suggested that these may deter some nest predators such as squirrels.

==Colonial nesting==
Though most birds nest individually, some species—including seabirds, penguins, flamingos, many herons, gulls, terns, weaver, some corvids and some sparrows—gather together in sizeable colonies. Birds that nest colonially may benefit from increased protection against predation. They may also be able to better use food supplies, by following more successful foragers to their foraging sites.

== Ecological importance ==

In constructing nests, birds act as ecosystem engineers by providing a sheltered microclimate and concentrated food sources for invertebrates. A global checklist lists eighteen invertebrate orders that occur in bird nests.

==In human culture==
Many birds may nest close to human habitations. In addition to nest boxes which are often used to encourage cavity nesting birds (see below), other species have been specially encouraged : for example nesting white storks have been protected and held in reverence in many cultures, and the nesting of peregrine falcons on tall modern or historical buildings has captured popular interest.

Colonial breeders produce guano in and around their nesting sites, which is a valuable fertilizer from the Andean Pacific coast and other areas.

The saliva nest of the edible-nest swiftlet is used to make bird&#x27;s nest soup, long considered a delicacy in China. Collection of the swiftlet nests is big business: in one year, more than 3.5 million nests were exported from Borneo to China, and the industry was estimated at $1 billion US per year (and increasing) in 2008. While the collection is regulated in some areas (at the Gomantong Caves, for example, where nests can be collected only from February to April or July to September), it is not in others, and the swiftlets are declining in areas where the harvest reaches unsustainable levels.

Some species of birds are considered nuisances when they nest in the proximity of human habitations. Feral pigeons are often unwelcome and sometimes also considered as a health risk.

The Beijing National Stadium, principal venue of the 2008 Summer Olympics, has been nicknamed &quot;The Bird Nest&quot; because of its architectural design, which its designers likened to a bird&#x27;s woven nest.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, naturalists often collected bird&#x27;s eggs and their nests. The practice of egg-collecting or oology is now illegal in many jurisdictions worldwide; the study of bird nests is called caliology.

==Artificial bird nests==

Bird nests are also built by humans to help in the conservation of certain birds. For example, artificial swallow nests are generally built with plaster, wood, terracotta or stucco.

Artificial nests, such as nest boxes, are an important conservation tool for many species, however nest box programs rarely compare their effectiveness with individuals not using nest boxes. Red-footed falcons using nest boxes in heavily managed landscapes produced fewer fledglings than those nesting in natural nests, but also than pairs nesting in nest boxes in more natural habitats.

<doc id="947043" wikidata="Q299165" url="?curid=947043" title="Emílio Garrastazu Médici">
<text>Emílio Garrastazu Médici (; 4 December 1905 – 9 October 1985) was a Brazilian military leader and politician who was the 28th president of Brazil from 1969 to 1974. His authoritarian rule marked the apex of the Brazilian military regime.

During his administration, the country experienced the so-called &quot;Economic Miracle&quot;, characterized by a 55.84% growth in GDP (an average of 11.16% per year) and a 42.15% increase in per capita income (an average of 8.43% per year). However, this period also saw a threefold rise in external debt and a growing income disparity. Médici took office with inflation at 19.31% and left it at 15.54%. However, the economic growth of the period was driven by a significant increase in foreign investment and a broad state-led investment program funded through international credit institutions. The latter caused a drastic rise in external debt, which grew from $3.9 billion in 1968 to over $12.5 billion in 1973.

His administration also saw the completion of development projects such as the National Integration Plan (PIN), which enabled the construction of the Trans-Amazonian Highway and the Rio-Niterói Bridge, among other initiatives. There were also significant tax incentives for industry and agriculture, and an agreement with Paraguay for the construction of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Plant — still the most productive hydroelectric facility in the world.

During Médici&#x27;s presidency, the military dictatorship reached its peak, with strict control over the limited political activities allowed. Repression and censorship of civil institutions were intensified, and any expression of dissent against the regime was prohibited. This period was marked by the systematic use of violent repression, including torture and assassination. Historically, his presidency has been referred to as the &quot;Years of Lead.&quot; As a result of this legacy, in 2015 and 2024, respectively, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel) revoked the honorary Doctorate degrees they had awarded him in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Médici was born in Bagé, Rio Grande do Sul state. From his father&#x27;s side, he was the grandson of Italian immigrants who went to Uruguay and then moved to Brazil. On his mother&#x27;s side he descended from Basques. In the 1920s he entered military school at Porto Alegre and then the Army where he was steadily promoted, becoming general in 1961.

Throughout the 1950s he served as a commander of reserve forces before being appointed chief of staff to Artur da Costa e Silva from 1957 to 1960. After the military coup Médici became Brazil&#x27;s military attache to the USA from 1964–1966. In 1967 Médici was appointed chief of the National Intelligence Service of Brazil.

==Presidency (1969–1974) ==

In 1969 he became commander of the Third Army and was chosen to become President of Brazil by the Brazilian Military Junta of 1969, succeeding Costa e Silva, who had suffered a stroke. As the President was elected by National Congress, it had to be re-convened for this purpose after being dismissed by Costa e Silva. Médici was the only candidate, though since the legislature was dominated by the pro-military National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA), his election would have been a foregone conclusion in any case. The legislature elected him by a margin of 313–0, with 56 abstentions. Médici took the oath on 30 October 1969 and served until the end of his term on 15 March 1974.

===Domestic policy===
Médici ruled under a 1967 Constitution which had been amended a few months earlier to be even more authoritarian than its predecessor. This constitution, along with the Institutional Act Number Five (AI-5, which gave the government sweeping powers to censor the press and restrict civil rights), formed the legal basis for some of the most severe human rights abuses of the military&#x27;s two-decade rule. He made liberal use of torture and strict press censorship. The importation of the men&#x27;s magazines &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot; and &quot;Lui&quot;, as well as the West German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, was banned because they offended &quot;morality and proper behavior&quot;. His regime also spied on political opponents, many of whom were tortured and disappeared. He and his predecessor, Costa e Silva, represented the most rigidly authoritarian faction of the military, an element that was willing to stay in power for as long as it deemed necessary to increase Brazil&#x27;s power. Médici created Indigenous territories.

===Economic policy===
This harsh repression came amid a period of explosive economic growth. Médici&#x27;s term was met with the largest economic growth of any Brazilian President. The Brazilian Miracle unfolded, authored jointly by his liberal ministers ahead of the Ministério do Planejamento and Ministério da Fazenda (planning and finances) Roberto Campos and Delfim Netto, and the country won the 1970 Football World Cup. In 1971 Médici presented the First National Development Plan aimed at increasing the rate of economic growth especially in the remote Northeast and Amazon basin.

During the Brazilian Miracle, the economy grew rapidly at a rate of 10% per year and inflation was kept relatively low in comparison to the stratospheric levels during the governments before the implementation of the military regime. Large construction projects were undertaken, including the Trans-Amazonian Highway, the Itaipu Dam and Rio–Niterói bridge. On the other side, the economic growth benefited mainly the richer classes — by the end of 1970, the official minimum wage went down to US$40/month, and the more than one-third of the Brazilian workforce whose wages were tied to it lost about 50% of their purchasing power in relation to 1960 levels at the end of Juscelino Kubitschek&#x27;s administration.

===Power output===
In November 1970 federal, state, and municipal elections were held. Most of the seats were won by ARENA candidates. In 1974, he was succeeded by his handpicked choice, Ernesto Geisel, despite attempts by some hardliners to derail his candidacy.

===Years of leadership and accusations of torture===
During his rule, the guerrilla movement led by Carlos Marighela, leader of Ação Libertadora Nacional, and Carlos Lamarca was mostly destroyed and Marighela and Lamarca killed. Revolutionary Movement 8th October was suppressed and Araguaia Guerrilla War won.

In the 1980s, the Catholic vicariate of São Paulo and Protestant ministers obtained thousands of classified documents that detailed the use of torture during Médici&#x27;s term. These revelations shocked average Brazilians who had been unaware of the extensive use of torture.

===Foreign relations===
In 1971, President Richard Nixon and Médici discussed coordinating their efforts to overthrow Cuba&#x27;s Fidel Castro and Chile&#x27;s Salvador Allende. National security advisor Henry Kissinger&#x27;s account of the 9 December 1971, White House visit by Médici was written &quot;for the president&#x27;s file&quot; and classified Top Secret. It was declassified on 4 September 2008, and made public in July as part of a State Department publication on U.S. foreign policy.
Kissinger&#x27;s memo shows that it was Nixon who raised the subject of Allende during the meeting, asking for Médici&#x27;s views on Chile: &quot;Médici said Allende would be overthrown&quot;. [Nixon] then asked whether Médici thought that the Chilean armed forces were capable of overthrowing Allende. Médici replied that he felt that they were, and [he] made clear that Brazil was &quot;working towards this end.&quot; The memo notes that Nixon and Médici also discussed whether Cuba should have readmission to the Organization of American States. For his part, Médici noted that Peru was trying to persuade the OAS to consider readmitting Cuba and asked Nixon how they should cooperate to oppose the move. Nixon said he would study the issue and reply to Médici &quot;privately&quot;. The OAS voted to lift sanctions on Cuba in 1974.

== Post-presidency and death ==
Médici was succeeded by General Ernesto Geisel on March 15, 1974. Upon leaving the presidency, Médici retired from public life, aside from declaring himself against the political amnesty enacted in August 1979 during the administration of João Figueiredo.

Médici would die of kidney failure on October 9, 1985 at the age of 79 after suffering a stroke. His body was buried in the São João Batista Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro.

<text>The Imola Circuit, officially called the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari (), is a motor racing circuit. It is located in the town of Imola, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, east of Bologna. It is one of the few major international circuits to run in an anti-clockwise direction. Initially used for motorcycle racing, the first race at Imola was held in 1953. The circuit has an FIA Grade One licence. The circuit is named after the founder of the Ferrari car company, Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), and his son Alfredo &quot;Dino&quot; Ferrari (1932–1956). It was called the Autodromo di Imola from 1953 to 1956 and the Autodromo Dino Ferrari from 1957 to 1988.

Imola hosted non-championship Formula One races in the 1963 Imola Grand Prix and the 1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix. It was used for official championship races in the 1980 Italian Grand Prix and the San Marino Grand Prix every year from 1981 to 2006. Safety concerns with the circuit were raised throughout the 1980s and 1990s, particularly with the high speed Tamburello corner where numerous accidents occurred. This resulted in fatalities, including the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994. Chicanes were introduced at multiple points to reduce cornering speeds, which changed the nature of the course and caused problems with their high kerbs.

Formula One stopped racing at Imola in 2007, leading the circuit owners to undertake major reconstruction work to the track and pit lane facilities. After the work was completed, a contract was signed for Formula One to return to Imola from 2017, but legal disputes prevented this from occurring. It eventually returned in 2020, with the circuit hosting the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix since 2020. When Formula One visits Imola, it is considered one of the home circuits of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, which is based in nearby Maranello.

The circuit has hosted many other motor racing series, including the Superbike World Championship, Motocross World Championship, World Touring Car Championship and European Le Mans Series. Several road bicycle races have also used the circuit, including stages of the Giro d&#x27;Italia and UCI Road World Championships.

==History==

The track was originally called the Autodromo di Imola, and inaugurated as a semi-permanent venue in 1953. It had no chicanes, so the runs from Acque Minerali to Rivazza, and from Rivazza all the way to Tosa, through the pits and the Tamburello, were just straights with a few small bends; the circuit remained in this configuration until 1972.

In April 1953, the first motorcycle races took place, while the first car race took place in June 1954. In April 1963, the circuit hosted its first Formula One race, as a non-championship event, won by Jim Clark for Lotus. A further non-championship event took place at Imola in 1979, which was won by Niki Lauda for Brabham-Alfa Romeo.

In 1980 Imola officially debuted in the Formula One World Championship calendar by hosting the 1980 Italian Grand Prix. It was the first time since the 1948 Edition held at Parco del Valentino that the Autodromo Nazionale Monza did not host the Italian Grand Prix. The race was won by Nelson Piquet and it was such a success that a new race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was established especially for Imola in and remained on the calendar until . The race was held over 60 laps of the circuit for a total race distance of 300 kilometres.

Imola has hosted a round of the Superbike World Championship from 2001 to 2006 and later since 2009. It hosts the final round of the FIM Motocross World Championship since 2018.

The World Touring Car Championship visited Imola in 2005 for the Race of San Marino, in 2008 for the Race of Europe, and in 2009 for the Race of Italy. The venue hosted a round of the International GT Open from 2009 to 2011 and also in 2021. The TCR International Series raced at Imola in 2016.

The 6 Hours of Imola was revived in 2011 and added to the Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup as a season event until 2016, but it returned again to European Le Mans Series calendar again in 2022 as &quot;4 Hours of Imola&quot;. It also hosted the 12 Hours of Imola in 2017-2018, a round of the 24H Series.

The track was also used as part of the finishing circuit for the 1968 UCI Road World Championships, which saw Italian cyclist Vittorio Adorni winning with a lead of 10 minutes and 10 seconds over runner up Herman Van Springel, the second largest winning margin in the history of the championships, after Georges Ronsse&#x27;s victory in 1928. In addition Adorni&#x27;s countryman Michele Dancelli took the bronze and five of the top six finishers were Italian. The circuit was used for stage 11 of the 2015 Giro d&#x27;Italia, which was won by Ilnur Zakarin, and stage 12 of the 2018 Giro d&#x27;Italia, won by Sam Bennett. The circuit also served as the start and finish of the 2020 UCI Road World Championships on 27 September 2020.

==Tamburello ==
Despite the addition of chicanes to several parts of the lap, such as the &quot;Acque Minerali&quot;, &quot;Variante Alta&quot;, and &quot;Variante Bassa&quot;, the circuit was subject to constant safety concerns, mostly regarding the flat-out &quot;Tamburello&quot; corner, which was very bumpy and had dangerously little room between the track and a concrete wall without a tyre barrier that separated the circuit from the Santerno river that runs adjacent to it.

In 1987, Nelson Piquet crashed heavily during practice after a tyre failure and missed the race due to injury. In 1989, Gerhard Berger crashed his Ferrari at Tamburello after a front wing failure. The car instantaneously ignited after the severe impact at but thanks to the quick work of the firefighters and medical personnel Berger survived and missed only one race (the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix) due to burns to his hands. Michele Alboreto suffered a massive shunt whilst testing his Footwork Arrows at the circuit in 1991 but escaped injury. The following year, Riccardo Patrese also crashed at the same corner while testing for the Williams team.

In response to the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, modifications were carried out to the Tamburello corner to make it safer by converting it from a flat-out left hander to a left-right-left chicane.

==1994 San Marino Grand Prix==


In the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, during Friday practice Rubens Barrichello was launched over a kerb and into the top of a tyre barrier at the Variante Bassa, knocking the Brazilian unconscious, though quick medical intervention saved his life. During Saturday qualifying Austrian Roland Ratzenberger crashed head-on into a wall at over at the Villeneuve corner after his Simtek lost the front wing, dying instantly from a basilar skull fracture. The tragedy continued the next day when the three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Williams&#x27; steering column broke and he crashed into the concrete wall at the Tamburello corner on Lap 7. Senna died in the hospital several hours after his crash. In two unrelated incidents, several spectators and mechanics were also injured during the event.

In the aftermath, the circuit continued to host Grands Prix, but revisions were immediately made in an attempt to make it safer. The flat-out Tamburello corner was reduced to a 4th gear left–right sweeper, and a gravel trap was added to the limited space on the outside of the corner. Villeneuve corner, previously an innocuous 6th gear right-hander into Tosa, was made a complementary 4th gear sweeper, also with a gravel trap on the outside of the corner. In an attempt to retain some of the quickness and character of the old circuit, the arduous chicane at Acqua Minerali was eliminated, and the Variante Bassa was straightened into a single chicane. Many say that the new circuit configuration is not as good as it used to be as a result of the new chicanes at Tamburello and Villeneuve.

Another modification made to the Imola track is that of Variante Alta, which is situated at the top of the hill leading down to Rivazza and has the hardest braking point on the lap. The Variante Alta, formerly a high-kerbed chicane, was hit quite hard by the drivers which caused damage to the cars and was the site of quite a few accidents. Before the 2006 Grand Prix, the kerbs were lowered considerably and the turn itself was tightened to reduce speeds and hopefully reduce the number of accidents at the chicane.

The Grand Prix was removed from the calendar of the 2007 Formula One season. SAGIS, the company that owns the circuit, hoped that the race would be reinstated at the October 2006 meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council and scheduled for the weekend of 29 April 2007, provided renovations to the circuit were completed in time for the race, but the reinstatement was denied.

==Recent developments==

Since 2007, the circuit has undergone major revisions. A bypass to the Variante Bassa chicane was added for cars, making the run from Rivazza 2 to the first Tamburello chicane totally flat-out, much like the circuit in its original fast-flowing days. However, the chicane is still used for motorcycle races.

The old pit garages and paddock have been demolished and completely rebuilt while the pitlane was extended and resurfaced. The reconstruction was overseen by German F1 track architect Hermann Tilke.

In June 2008, with most of the reconstruction work completed, The FIA gave the track a &quot;1T&quot; rating, meaning that an official Formula One Test can be held at the circuit; circuits require the &quot;1&quot; homologation to host a Formula One Grand Prix. As of August 2011, the track received a &#x27;1&#x27; FIA homologation rating after an inspection by Charlie Whiting.

In June 2015, the owners of the circuit confirmed they were in talks to return to the Formula One calendar should Monza, whose contract was scheduled to run out after the season, be unable to make a new deal to keep hosting a round of the world championship. On 18 July 2016, Imola signed a deal to host the Italian Grand Prix from the season. However, on 2 September 2016, it was announced that Monza had secured a new deal to continue hosting the race, and Imola&#x27;s officials took legal action against this decision questioning the legality of government funding awarded to Monza. On 8 November 2016, they withdrew their case. In February 2020, the owners at Imola submitted a bid to replace the 2020 Chinese Grand Prix pending its cancellation as a precaution in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 July 2020, it was confirmed that the circuit would be added to the calendar for the 2020 Formula One World Championship with the race being called the &quot;Emilia Romagna Grand Prix&quot; in honour of the region the circuit is situated in. In a break with Formula One tradition the event at the circuit took place over two days instead of three on 31 October and 1 November 2020. Imola was kept on the calendar for 2021, following the postponement of the Chinese Grand Prix due to the pandemic, and later for the 2022 calendar as well. The 2023 Grand Prix was set to be held on 21 May 2023 but had to be cancelled as a result of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna floods that also affected the Circuit by the flooding Santerno river. Imola is due to host a F1 Grand Prix until 2025.

The circuit&#x27;s president is Giancarlo Minardi of the former Minardi F1 team.

==Non-motorsport events==
Since 1981, the circuit has been hosting the early-September &quot;Mostra Scambio&quot; (&quot;Trading Exposition&quot;), an open-air market primarily focused on the exhibition and trade of vintage vehicles and their parts; this event is also popularly (but inaccurately) called CRAME, after the name of the historical society organizing it.
The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19.

Among the major musical performances held on the track were:
* Heineken Jammin&#x27; Festival (1998–2006)
* Sonisphere (2011)
* AC/DC – &quot;Rock or Bust World Tour&quot; (2015)
* Laura Pausini – &quot;Pausini Stadi&quot; (2016)
* Guns N&#x27; Roses – &quot;Not in this Lifetime Tour&quot; (2017)
* Mario Biondi (2019)
* Pearl Jam – &quot;Gigaton Tour&quot; (2022)

Partially due to the vicinity of the Romeo Galli athletics stadium, the Acque Minerali park, and the Tre Monti hills, the Autodromo is not commonly used for bicycle or on-foot sporting activities (albeit with notable exceptions, such as two segments of the Giro d&#x27;Italia in the 2010s, and 2020 UCI Road World Championships); however, the civic administration does occasionally allocate summer days in which the public can walk or cycle along the track.

== Lap records ==
The official lap record for the current Grand Prix circuit layout is 1:15.484, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, while the unofficial all-time track record is 1:13.609, set by Valtteri Bottas in the qualifying of aforementioned race. As of October 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Imola Circuit are listed as:


==Fatal accidents==

*Roland Ratzenberger – 1994 San Marino Grand Prix (Qualifying)
*Ayrton Senna – 1994 San Marino Grand Prix (Race)

<text>Charing () is a village and civil parish in the Ashford district of Kent, in south-east England. It includes the settlements of Charing Heath and Westwell Leacon. It is located at the foot of the North Downs and reaches up to the escarpment. In 2011 the parish had a population of 2,766.

The Pilgrims&#x27; Way, the M20 motorway and Charing railway station (between London Victoria and Ashford International via Maidstone) serve the parish.

==History==
The name Charing first appears in 799 as &quot;Ciorrincg&quot;. The name probably comes from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;cerring&quot;, which means a bend in the road, or it may be from &quot;Ceorra-ingas&quot;, which is Anglo-Saxon, meaning &quot;people of Ceorra&quot;. The village is sited on the Pilgrims&#x27; Way from London to Canterbury, and is one day&#x27;s walk from Canterbury. There are a number of old manors located around the village, such as Newlands (now a horse stud) and Pett Place. The village had a market recorded in 1285, and a fair recorded in the fifteenth century.

The Church of St Peter and St Paul, Charing, the parish church of Charing, is situated next to the remains of the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, just off the High Street. The church&#x27;s west tower was built in the 14th century, though most of the rest of the building was reconstructed following a catastrophic fire in the 16th century. The church contains a number of memorials to the Dering family, a branch of the Dering family of Surrenden Dering, Pluckley, Kent.

==Mills==
Charing has had four mills over the centuries, serving the needs of the villagers. There were two watermills on the Upper Great Stour and two windmills.

;Watermills
*&quot;Burnt Mill&quot;, a corn mill working until the 1950s, now derelict.
*&quot;Field Mill&quot;, a corn mill, the building of which survives retaining its waterwheel.

;Windmills
*&quot;Charing Mill&quot;, also known as &quot;Field Mill&quot; on the Downs above the village is a smock mill which was built in the early nineteenth century and last worked in 1891. It stands today as a house conversion.
*&quot;Charing Heath Mill&quot; was a smock mill that was demolished c.1878. Millers include William Missing in 1845 and Robert Millgate 1862 – 1878

==Places of interest==
Its most famous building is the Archbishop&#x27;s Palace, which lies by the church and was an ancient possession of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The palace was an important building in the diocese of Canterbury, and counted amongst its guests King Henry VIII, who took it for himself. It has been a farmhouse for the last 300 years. In 2004, the palace was an unsuccessful contestant in the BBC television programme &quot;Restoration&quot;, where a number of potential restoration projects throughout the UK competed for funds. 
The church is said to contain the stone on which John the Baptist was beheaded.

==Amenities==
These include: 
*C of E Primary School
*Library
*Doctors&#x27; surgery
*Independent shops/franchises
*Kentish Tea Room
*Two mid-to-large sized pubs, most of which are listed buildings: 
**&quot;The Bowl&quot;
**&quot;The Wagon &amp; Horses&quot;
*The Kent County Crematorium. At which were cremated 60 Commonwealth service personnel of World War II and the author Charles Hamilton, who as Frank Richards created Billy Bunter. Here also were cremated Archbishops William Temple and Cosmo Gordon Lang.

==Community==
Housing development since the 1960s has also led to a significant proportion of people employed in London or business parks on the motorway corridors. Groups of residents organise frequent club-based or charity events and fairs. Charing has in the same period revived its Youth Club and cricket team/facilities. There is also a bowls club. A skate park has been added. A Community Warden assists the youths.

There are two bus stops in Charing, with the only bus services running through being the 10X and 124, which runs exclusively as a school bus.

Charing railway station was opened on 1 July 1884, as part of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) extension to of the 1874 line to Maidstone, which itself was a branch off the LCDR&#x27;s Sevenoaks branch of 1862, which joined the LCDR mainline of 1840 at Swanley. In the wake of 1955 British Rail Modernisation plan, the &quot;Kent Coast Electrification&quot; scheme saw the suburban electrification of the previous Southern Railway extended from Maidstone East through to Ashford. Train services are currently operated by Southeastern, with one train in each direction throughout the middle of the day, and an enhanced service during peak periods.

<doc id="947084" wikidata="Q5437962" url="?curid=947084" title="Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat">
<text>Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat was an unofficial mascot of the 2000 Summer Olympics created by Sydney cartoonist Paul Newell with Roy and HG from the Australian Channel Seven sports/comedy television program &quot;The Dream with Roy and HG&quot;. Fatso is a wombat with a lazy, cheerful expression and comically pronounced rump. It usually appeared on &quot;The Dream&quot; broadcasts, sometimes as a life-size stuffed toy on Roy and HG&#x27;s desk.

Fatso was a spoof of the official Olympic mascots Olly, Millie, and Syd, whom Roy &amp; HG disparaged as &quot;Olly, Millie and Dickhead&quot;. He was nicknamed &quot;the battlers&#x27; prince&quot; and proved to be more popular among Australian fans of the duo (and some visitors who viewed the program) than the official mascots. Fatso appeared with gold medalists Susie O&#x27;Neill, Grant Hackett and the Australian men&#x27;s 4×200-metre relay team on the winners&#x27; dais. He consequently appears on an official commemorative postage stamp of the Australian men&#x27;s 4×200-metre relay team in the arms of Michael Klim. During the Olympics, the Australian Olympic Committee attempted to ban athletes appearing with Fatso to stop him upstaging their official mascots. The ensuing public relations disaster forced the president of the AOC, John Coates, and the director general of the IOC, Francois Carrard, to distance their organisations from these attempts.

In keeping with Fatso&#x27;s role as a protest against the commercialisation of Olympic mascots, only two Fatsos were officially produced: one for use in the studio and the other for use in the athletes&#x27; village. At the end of the Olympics, one of the Fatsos was auctioned for the Olympic Aid charity, selling for A$80,450 to Seven Network executive chairman Kerry Stokes. Fatso is currently housed in a glass box in Kerry Stokes&#x27; North Sydney office. A number of unofficial Fatso toys and memorabilia were sold by merchants without authorisation from the producers of &quot;The Dream&quot;. A statue of Fatso appeared as part of an official Olympic memorial outside the Sydney Olympic Stadium, commemorating the volunteers who worked during the Olympics. The Fatso statue was vandalised in late September 2010, then stolen sometime before 8 October 2010.

<text>Monkstown (), historically known as &quot;Carrickbrennan&quot; (), is a suburb in south Dublin, located in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland. It is on the coast, between Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire while also bordering Sallynoggin and Deansgrange inland.

The lands of the Carrickbrennan estate form the greater part of the civil parish of Monkstown.

== History ==
A church was built at Carrickbrennan (as Monkstown was then known) before the 8th century, and dedicated to Saint Mochonna, bishop of Inispatrick or Holmpatrick by Skerries. The grange of Carrickbrennan, otherwise Monkstown, was granted by the King to the Cistercian monks of Saint Mary&#x27;s Abbey, Dublin, in 1200. The monks built their grange near to the church, and the village grew up around it. The lands of which it was a part extended as far south as Bulloch harbour on the outskirts of Dalkey, where the monks constructed a fishing harbour protected by a castle.

In 1539, King Henry VIII awarded the Monkstown lands to Sir John Travers, Master of the Ordnance in Ireland. John Travers lived in his Castle at Monkstown from 1557 to his death in 1562 (he is buried in the Carrickbrennan Graveyard) when the property fell to James Eustace 3rd Viscount Baltinglass through his marriage to Mary Travers. In 1580, the Castle was used as a rebellion stronghold, after which it was awarded to Sir Henry Wallop, Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. The lands were later returned to Mary, the widowed Lady Baltinglass, who later married Gerald Alymer. On her death in 1610 the Castle was transferred to the Chevers family through the marriage of Mary Travers&#x27;s sister Catherine to John Chevers, and the property passed directly to his second son Henry Chevers, who married Catherine, daughter of Sir Richard Fitzwilliam. Henry and Catherine Chevers lived here with their four children (Walter, Thomas, Patrick, Margaret).

Upon the death of Henry in 1640, the castle and lands were passed to Walter Cheevers. Walter and family received a command to vacate Monkstown in 1653 by the Cromwellian Commissioners, and transplanted to Killyan, County Galway. In 1660, Walter Chevers was restored to his estate at Monkstown Castle, until his death in 1678. His death occurred on the 20 December 1678, and he was buried at Mountoun (Monkstown), two days later on the 22nd. The Shivers family of America trace their lineage to Thomas Chevers brother of Walter Chevers of Monkstown, through the Cromwellian warrant, authorized on 26 November 1653 for Captain John Whittey to transport the Thomas Chevers family to America.

Monkstown was later purchased by the Archbishop of Armagh, Michael Boyle, and his son Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington enlarged the castle, making it one of the finest residences.

Until about 1800, Monkstown was a rural area of open countryside, dotted here and there with large houses owned by the merchants of Dublin. The Monkstown Church (Church of Ireland) had been built – but was smaller than the present church.

The two small local rivers met in the area now called Pakenham Road. The river known as Micky Briens originated in Sallynoggin. A lake beside Monkstown Castle had one small island. The coastline was ragged and rocky, with a harbour stretching over 100 yards inland at the mouth of the aforementioned rivers, adjacent to the area now occupied by the West Pier. Dún Laoghaire (then called Dunleary, and later Kingstown) was then a small group of houses in the area of the Purty Kitchen, and the present area of Dún Laoghaire was an area of rocky outcrops and later, quarries.

Wednesday, 18 November 1807 a night of disasters in southern Dublin. In a horrific storm, two sailing ships, the Rochdale and the Prince of Wales were blown onto the rocks, one at Seapoint and the other at Blackrock. About 400 lives in total were lost on that night, many of them washed up on the shore at Monkstown. The disaster was one of the factors which led to the building of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Most of the victims were buried in Carrickbrennan Churchyard.

The building of Dún Laoghaire harbour gave an impetus to the area, and Montpelier Parade was the first of many terraces built in the area. The coming of the railway in 1837 had a much greater impact. Firstly, it changed the topology of the coast, and secondly, it led to Monkstown becoming a commuter suburb of the city of Dublin. Most of the houses along Monkstown Road and the avenues north of that road were constructed over the next 30 years. The maps of 1870 show this phase completed, but the rest of Monkstown consists of mansions surrounded by extensive gardens. 
For the following 50 years there was little change. The post-war developments of Castle Park, Richmond, Windsor, etc. and the more recent developments of Brook Court, Monkstown Valley, and Carrickbrennan Lawn mean that there is little opportunity for further development.

The diaries of the Rev John Thomas Hynes (1799–1868), a Catholic bishop who retired to Monkstown in 1861–68, provide a valuable insight into daily life in Monkstown in that period. Hynes lived at Bloomwood, Monkstown Avenue (later renamed Carrickbrennan Road), and later moved to Uplands, The Hill, Monkstown. The Hynes Diaries recount such details as the coming of gas lighting, the postal and travel facilities, church affairs, and lots of local gossip. The Hynes diaries are now preserved in Melbourne, but the full text has been made available online.

<doc id="947089" wikidata="Q5632569" url="?curid=947089" title="HMS Gladiolus (K34)">
<text>HMS &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was a of the Royal Navy, the first ship of her class.

She was laid down at Smiths Dock Company on the River Tees on 19 October 1939, launched on 24 January 1940, and commissioned on 6 April 1940.
&quot;Gladiolus&quot; was active in the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II and spent most of her service career on convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic. She was lost in action on 16 October 1941.

==Service history==
After commissioning and working up, &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was assigned to the Western Approaches Escort Force.
In her 18 months of service she escorted over 40 convoys, of which over a dozen were attacked; &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was involved in four major convoy battles, and participated destroying three U-boats.

She was engaged in all the duties performed by corvettes; escorting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors.

On 28 June 1940 she picked up 35 survivors from , that had been torpedoed and sunk by Fritz-Julius Lemp&#x27;s .

&quot;Gladiolus&quot; was involved in the sinking of the Type I U-boat on 1 July 1940. This was the first U-boat kill by a corvette. &quot;U-26&quot; had been heavily damaged by eight depth charges from &quot;Gladiolus&quot;, as well as bombs from a Short Sunderland aircraft, and subsequently scuttled herself.

As one of the early Flowers &quot;Gladiolus&quot; suffered from the drawbacks of her type; a short forecastle, merchant type bridge, and poor habitability. In October 1940 she went into dock for remedial work and was re-fitted with a longer foc’s’le to improve her habitability. This necessitated ballasting, to avoid pitch problems, and a tilt test, to check stability. These were satisfactory, and she returned to action in January 1941, assigned to one of the new escort groups, 2 EG, led by .

In April 1941 &quot;Gladiolus&quot; involved in the battle for HX 121. On 28 April &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was sent with the destroyers and to re-inforce HX 121 which was under attack. During the onslaught &quot;Gladiolus&quot; and the destroyers gained contact and made a series of attacks; it was subsequently shown this was on , which escaped.
&quot;Douglas&quot; also gained a contact and made an attack, but saw no result. On 29 April &quot;Gladiolus&quot; rescued survivors from &quot;Beacon Grange&quot; which had been torpedoed by . Later that day she sighted a U-boat on the surface and attacked, being rewarded with a gush of air bubbles and wreckage. &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was credited with destroying , but post-war re-evaluation found no U-boat attacked that day, and attributed &quot;U-65&quot;″s destruction to the attack by &quot;Douglas&quot; the previous day.

In June 1941 HX 133 came under attack; &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was detached from escorting OB 335 to join as reinforcement.
On 24/25 June, after midnight, she sighted , and attacked. She attempted to ram, but slowed to avoid major damage, and &quot;U-71&quot; dived away. &quot;Gladiolus&quot; then launched five attacks, using 30 depth charges altogether, and was joined by , which launched another six. &quot;U-71&quot; was severely damaged, and surfaced to try to escape on the surface; &quot;Gladiolus&quot; and &quot;Nasturtium&quot; opened fire, scoring hits on &quot;U-71&quot;″s conning tower. &quot;Gladiolus&quot; claimed a kill for this, and was credited with sinking &quot;U-71&quot;, but the boat escaped to base. On 26/27 June in early hours, attacked the convoy, and was sighted by &quot;Nasturtium&quot;. She attacked and was joined by and &quot;Gladiolus&quot;. Altogether the three corvettes launched 50 depth charges; &quot;U-556&quot; was forced to the surface as &quot;Gladiolus&quot; dropped a further three depth charges; the corvettes then opened fire at point-blank range, hitting &quot;U-556&quot;″s conning tower. Her captain, Wohlfarth and the crew abandoned ship, and the boat sank before she could be secured.

In September 1941 &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was involved in the battle for SC 42. Under major attack, SC 42 lost 15 ships in two days, for the destruction of one U-boat. Numerous escorts were drafted in as reinforcement; on 11 September &quot;Gladiolus&quot; arrived with EG 2, led by &quot;Douglas&quot;. SC 42 was stalked for a further five days, losing two more ships, though the destroyers of EG 2 were able to sink another U-boat. This was, after SC 7, the worst convoy loss in the North Atlantic during the war.

Following this, &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was reassigned to the Newfoundland Local Escort Group, led by . In October 1941 she was part of the escort for SC 48, during which battle &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was lost.

==Fate==
&quot;Gladiolus&quot; was lost in October 1941 whilst escorting SC 48. At the time, she was under the command of Lieutenant Commander H. M. C. Sanders.

British sources record &quot;Gladiolus&quot; separated from SC 48 on the night of 15/16 October. At 2130 &quot;Empire Heron&quot; was hit, and &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was detached to chase down the attacker and search for survivors. At 2200 she signalled she had picked up one man, and was continuing to search. This was her last contact; nothing more is known of her, and there were no survivors from either vessel. It was believed that she had been sunk while picking up survivors or been lost in a marine accident.

However German sources, assuming &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was on station, credited her loss to possible hits reported by &quot;U-558&quot; or &quot;U-432&quot; during the melee on the night of 16/17 October: Another source has argued definitively for a stray torpedo from at 00.07. However historian Bernard Edwards is clear that &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was lost without rejoining the convoy; while acknowledging the claim for a loss in the early hours of the 17th, he states it is more likely that she went down before that.

In an interview with the BBC, former crew member Dick Turner speculated &quot;Gladiolus&quot; was unstable due to her refit, and had overturned during a violent manoeuvre.

In the absence of any conclusive explanation, the actual cause of her loss is unknown.

<text>Dale Sanders, FRS (born 13 May 1953) is a plant biologist and former Director of the John Innes Centre. The centre is an institute for research in plant sciences and microbiology, in Norwich, England.

==Education==
Sanders was educated at The Hemel Hempstead School. He gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of York reading Biology from 1971 to 1974, graduating with 1st Class Honours.

Sanders did his PhD alongside Professor Enid AC MacRobbie FRS at Darwin College, Cambridge in 1978, in the Department of Plant Sciences. In 1993, Sanders earned his Sc.D. from the University of Cambridge.

==Research==
Sanders’ research explores the transport of ions across plant cell membranes and the roles of ions in signalling and nutrient status.

Sanders’ first significant finding during his PhD was to provide unequivocal evidence that inorganic anion uptake in plants is powered by a proton gradient and showed how transport is regulated through intracellular ion concentrations.

In subsequent research as a post-doc at Yale University School of Medicine he pioneered the first methods to measure and interpret the interplay between control of intracellular pH and activity of the plasma membrane proton pump. Showing how the regulation of the proton pump is controlled by – and in turn controls – intracellular pH. This work on a fungus served as a paradigm for understanding the interplay of membrane transport and cellular homeostasis in fungal and plant cells.

On taking an academic position at the University of York, Sanders developed novel electrophysiological approaches to plant cellular signalling and membrane transport.

The Sanders lab demonstrated a key link between changes in cytosolic free calcium and photosynthetic activity, and through many technical developments showed how membrane transport at the plant vacuole is energised and regulated in response to physiological demand.

Sanders also developed a unified mathematical theory that explained complex kinetics of solute uptake in plants, along with having created the first methodology to measure transient changes in intracellular calcium levels in higher plants, and discovered that light/dark changes in photosynthetic activity were highly dependent on cytosolic changes in calcium.

In the days before extensive molecular biology, Sanders discovered that the vacuolar proton pump of plants was essentially similar to mitochondrial ATPases. He also adapted electrophysiological techniques first developed for exploration of neuronal channel properties to determine that pumps at vacuolar membranes exhibit kinetic responses to ion gradients that would not be predicted through biochemical means. Parallel to this, he discovered that vacuolar membranes exhibit electrically-driven ion release.

Using both electrophysiological and biochemical approaches, Sanders was able to establish for the first time in plants that metabolites can act as triggers for release of calcium (a cellular signal) from vacuoles.

Sanders established principles for biofortification of cereal crops with essential human mineral nutrients, and molecularly characterised calcium permeable channels. Sanders also discovered and characterised the first (and only) yeast calcium channel and demonstrated how cell marking can be used to distinguish cell types for patch clamp studies.

Sanders also had influence in the investigation into the roles of plant cyclic nucleotide-gated channels that were explored at an early stage of discovery and resulted in a major collaborative publication with another lab demonstrating a key role in plant-bacterial symbiosis signalling.

On top of his extensive discoveries, he has also written influential reviews on calcium signalling in plants, which have 3,300 combined citations on Google Scholar.

To further his work on calcium channels, he then discovered that the TPC1 channel is the major pathway for ion exchange across plant vacuolar membranes. Their speculations that the TPC1 channel is involved in Calcium-induced calcium release were proven for the first time in plants in work from Sanders’ lab. He then established the principal molecular and cellular mechanisms for plant tolerance to manganese toxicity.

Sanders has discovered the major mechanism of zinc accumulation in plant vacuoles, and more recently characterised the molecular properties of the transporter and showed how the transporter could be used for nutritional benefit for human consumption of cereal grains. On top of further collaborating with a Chinese lab to establish more generally the important role of zinc nutrition in rice.

Sander’s current research focuses on how plant cells respond to changes in their environment and how they store the nutrients they acquire. In particular, his group work on how transport of chemical elements across cell membranes in plants is integrated with cellular signalling and nutritional status.

==Career==
Sanders&#x27; research career began at the Yale University School of Medicine, first as a postdoctoral research fellow (1978–1979) and then as a postdoctoral research associate (1979–1983).

After a stint as a visiting research fellow in the University of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney (1983), Sanders moved into the biology department at the University of York in 1983, first as a lecturer (1983–1989), a reader (1989–1992), a professor (1992–2010), also acting as the head of department (2004–2010).

In 2010 Sanders moved to the John Innes Centre, Norwich, as director and group leader, establishing new collaborations with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

==Awards and honours==
Sanders was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2001.

<text>BBC television dramas have been produced and broadcast since even before the public service company had an officially established television broadcasting network in the United Kingdom. As with any major broadcast network, drama forms an important part of its schedule, with many of the BBC&#x27;s top-rated programmes being from this genre.

From the 1950s through to the 1980s the BBC received much acclaim for the range and scope of its drama productions, producing series, serials and plays across a range of genres, from soap opera to science-fiction to costume drama, with the 1970s in particular being regarded as a critical and cultural high point in terms of the quality of dramas being produced. In the 1990s, a time of change in the British television industry, the department went through much internal confusion and external criticism, but since the beginning of the 21st century has begun to return to form with a run of critical and popular successes, despite continual accusations of the drama output and the BBC in general dumbing down.

Many BBC productions have also been exported to and screened in other countries, particularly in the United States on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; strand and latterly on the BBC&#x27;s own BBC America cable channel. Other major purchasers of BBC dramas include the BBC&#x27;s equivalents in other Commonwealth nations, such as Australia&#x27;s ABC, Canada&#x27;s CBC and Gibraltar&#x27;s Gibraltar Broadcasting Corporation (GBC).

==Experimental broadcasting and the 1930s==
Already an established national radio broadcaster, the BBC began test transmissions with the new technology of television in 1929, working with John Logie Baird and using his primitive early apparatus. The following year, as part of one of these test transmissions, the BBC screened their first television drama production, an adaptation of the Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s short play &quot;The Man With the Flower in His Mouth&quot;.

Broadcast live at 3.30pm on 14 July 1930, the play was produced from a small studio in the Baird Company headquarters at 133 Long Acre, London. The play was chosen because of its confined setting, small cast and short length, and was directed by Val Gielgud, who was at the time the BBC&#x27;s senior producer of radio drama. Because of the primitive 30-line camera technology, only one figure could be shown on screen at a time and the field of vision of the cameras was extremely restricted. The Prime Minister of the day, Ramsay MacDonald, watched the play with his family on the Baird Televisor Baird had previously installed at their 10 Downing Street home. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper commented that: &quot;This afternoon on the roof of 133, Long Acre will prove to be a memorable one... The time for interest and curiosity is come, but the time for serious criticism of television plays, as plays, is not yet.&quot;

The BBC&#x27;s test broadcasts continued throughout the early part of the decade as the quality of the medium improved. In 1936 the BBC launched the world&#x27;s first &quot;high-definition&quot;—then defined as at least 240-lines — television channel, the BBC Television Service, from studios in a specially converted wing of Alexandra Palace in London. At the time of the channel&#x27;s debut on 2 November 1936 there were only five television producers responsible for the entire output. The producer selected to oversee drama was George More O&#x27;Ferrall, who had some experience with working in a visual medium as he was a former assistant director of films. This was unlike most of his colleagues, who came across from the BBC&#x27;s radio services.

The first drama production to be mounted as a part of the new, regular service was a twenty-five-minute selection of scenes from the West End play &quot;Marigold&quot; by L. Allen Harker and F. R. Pryor, produced by O&#x27;Ferrall with the original London Royalty Theatre cast. This was broadcast live from the Alexandra Palace studios on the evening of Friday 6 November 1936. Later BBC Television Head of Drama Shaun Sutton wrote about the production for &quot;The Times&quot; in 1972. &quot;It was probably little more than a photographed version of the stage production, with the camera lying well back to preserve the picture-frame convention of the theatre.&quot; Most initial drama efforts were of a similar scale; productions of selected dramatised &#x27;scenes&#x27; or excerpts from popular novels and adaptations of stage plays, and a programme entitled &quot;Theatre Parade&quot; would regularly use original London theatre casts for re-enacting selected scenes.

An increasing number of full-length dramatised productions began to take place in the Alexandra Palace studios during 1937, with &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; in November 1937 being a notable full-scale adaptation of a play. When television transmissions on Sundays began in March 1938, one Sunday per month would see the broadcast of a full-length Shakespeare play by actors from the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Productions also become more technically advanced, with the use of film inserts on telecine and more ambitious shooting, cutting and mixing, as opposed to televising the equivalent of a standard theatrical performance with unmoving cameras. Outside broadcast cameras were used to show thirty Territorial Army troops with two howitzers in the Alexandra Palace grounds for added effect in &quot;The White Chateau&quot; (1938), and boats on the Palace lake in scenes depicting the Zeebrugge Raid in a World War I play.

&quot;The Times&quot; credited the ambition of BBC television drama in its review of a July 1938 modern dress version of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, while also criticising some of the production&#x27;s technical failings. &quot;From the moment when Mr. Sebastian Shaw and Mr. Anthony Ireland were discovered sitting at a &quot;café&quot; table, discussing the political situation over a glass of beer, looking like two Fascist officers, yet speaking the lines assigned to Brutus and Cassius, the attention of the audience was riveted... The penumbrascope, a device for providing a background by means of shadows, which came into play for the first time in this production, was used so carelessly that its edges were often visible. The essence of stagecraft is illusion, which must not be shattered by such accidents. Caesar&#x27;s ghost was also very unconvincing, nor did the handful of people listening to the funeral orations suggest an excited mob.&quot; Greater praise was given by the same paper to &quot;Felicity&#x27;s First Season&quot;, broadcast in September 1938 and, unusually for the time, written directly for television. &quot;The play relies on dialogue throughout, and there is a skilful use of film to suggest the journey to Scotland. While there are few characters and little change of scenery, enormous cocktail parties, balls, and jumble sales seemed to be in progress just out of sight. The result was something between a stage play and a film—that is to say, good television entertainment.&quot;

The overwhelming majority of BBC television drama produced during the 1930s consisted of adaptations of stage plays, but there were exceptions. These included the first multi-episodic drama serial, &quot;Ann and Harold&quot;, a five-part story about a married couple which began showing on 12 July 1938. There was also &quot;Telecrime&quot;, a series of ten- and twenty-minute plays which presented various crimes, with the viewers given enough clues to be able to solve themselves using the evidence shown on screen and the specially-written drama &quot;Condemned To Be Shot&quot; (1939).

As with almost all programmes of the era, the live television broadcasts meant that no record of the drama productions were kept outside of photographs, scripts and press reviews. The BBC Programme Organiser Cecil Madden later claimed that they had experimented with telerecording a production of &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, but were ordered by film director Alexander Korda to destroy the print as he felt it infringed his film rights.

Despite the difficulties and challenges its production often presented, drama had become a central part of the BBC&#x27;s television schedules; a BBC audience research survey conducted in 1937 found that 90% of those replying generally enjoyed the drama productions, a figure equalled only by outside broadcasts. In Christmas week 1938, drama accounted for fourteen of the twenty-two hours of programming broadcast. By the following year, drama programming had fifteen producers working on it, compared to nine for all other types of programmes combined.

In 1939, the total audience for the BBC&#x27;s programmes had grown to an estimated audience of 100,000 viewers, watching on 20,000 television sets. However, BBC television broadcasting ceased on 1 September 1939 in anticipation of World War II. The station remained off-air for the duration of the conflict. The British Government were afraid that the VHF transmission signals would act as a guiding beacon for German bombers targeting central London, and the technicians and engineers of the service would in any case be needed for war efforts such as the radar programme.

==The return of television and the 1950s==
BBC Television resumed broadcasting on 7 June 1946, and the service began in much the same way it had ceased in 1939, with many of the 1930s drama producers returning. In 1949 there was a major development in drama when Val Gielgud was made the new head of department, a position he had previously and successfully occupied at BBC Radio. Since producing the first television play in 1930, Gielgud had worked in television again, serving on attachment to the service at Alexandra Palace in 1939 and directing a half-hour adaptation of his own short story &quot;Ending It&quot;, starring John Robinson and Joan Marion and broadcast on 25 August 1939, less than a week before the service was placed on hiatus.

Gielgud was an unpopular choice with many in the television service, with the channel&#x27;s controller, Norman Collins, protesting that &quot;Anything less than complete familiarity with all aspects of television production will mean... that the Head of Television Drama is an amateur.&quot; Gielgud himself felt that television drama was too influenced by the cinema and ought to be closer to its radio equivalent, with television plays being more like illustrated radio broadcasts than independent entities in and of themselves. Gielgud eventually returned to radio, being replaced as Head of Drama by his assistant, the experienced producer Michael Barry, in 1952.

One important move that had occurred under Gielgud was the establishment in 1950 of the Script Department, and the hiring of the television service&#x27;s first in-house staff drama writers, Nigel Kneale and Philip Mackie. Gielgud began to commission new drama, such as Jack Hulbert&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Year&quot; in 1951, a contribution to the Festival of Britain and something of a throw-back to a previous age, as it was the first ever musical comedy made for television. Barry later expanded the Script Department and installed the experienced film producer Donald Wilson as its head in 1955. Television was now developing beyond simply adapting stories from other media into creating its own originally written productions. It was also becoming a high-profile medium, with national coverage and viewing figures now running into the millions, helped by the explosion of interest due to the live televising of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in the summer of 1953. 

That same year, Barry invested the majority of his original scripting budget into a six-part science-fiction serial written by Kneale and directed by Rudolph Cartier, an Austrian-born director who was establishing a reputation as the television service&#x27;s most inventive practitioner. Entitled &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, the serial (miniseries in American terminology) was a huge success and went a long way towards popularising the form, where one story is told over a short number of episodes, on British television: it is still one of the most popular drama formats in the medium to this day. Kneale and Cartier went on to be responsible for two sequel serials and many other highly successful and popular productions over the course of the decade, drawing many viewers to their programmes with their characteristic blend of horror and allegorical science fiction.

It was they who were responsible for the 1954 adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the second performance of which drew the largest television audience since the coronation, some seven million viewers, and is one of the earliest surviving dramas in the archive. The telerecording process had by now been perfected for capturing live broadcasts for repeat and overseas sales, although it was not until the early 1960s that the majority of BBC dramas were prerecorded on the new technology of videotape. The BBC, unlike American broadcasters, only gradually produced dramas shot entirely on film from the 1960s onwards; ITV&#x27;s filmed series were in the minority, and most of the commercial channel&#x27;s drama productions were made in the same &#x27;hybrid&#x27; form as those of the BBC. Filmed sequences would be mounted for external scenes which would be pre-shot and inserted into productions at relevant points, later being inserted into shows at the video editing stage. &quot;These sequences bought time for the more elaborate costume changes or scene set-ups, but also served to &#x27;open out&#x27; the action,&quot; as the British Film Institute explained on its &quot;Screenonline&quot; website in 2004.

The BBC suffered during the second half of the 1950s from the rise of the ITV network, which had debuted in 1955 and rapidly begun to take away audience share from the Corporation as its coverage spread nationally. Despite popular hits such as the police drama series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; and soap opera &quot;The Grove Family&quot;, the BBC was seen as being more highbrow, lacking the popular common touch of the commercial network. One of the major figures in commercial television drama of the late 1950s and early 1960s was Canadian producer Sydney Newman, the Head of Drama at ABC Weekend TV responsible for such programmes as &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In December 1962, keen to turn around the fortunes of their own drama department, the BBC invited Newman to replace the retiring Barry as Head of Drama, and he accepted, keen on the idea of transforming what he saw as the staid, docile image of BBC drama. 

==The &#x27;golden age&#x27; of BBC drama==
Even before Newman&#x27;s arrival, some BBC producers were attempting to break the mould, with Elwyn Jones, Troy Kennedy Martin and Allan Prior&#x27;s landmark police drama series &quot;Z-Cars&quot; shaking up the image of television police dramas and becoming an enormous popular success from 1962 onwards. Newman, however, restructured the entire department, dividing the unwieldy drama group into three separate divisions: series, for on-going continuing dramas with self-contained episodes; serials, for stories told over multi-episode runs, or programmes which were made up of a series of serials; and plays, for any kind of drama one-offs, an area Newman was especially keen on following the success of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; at ABC.
Newman followed BBC Managing Director of Television Sir Huw Wheldon&#x27;s famous edict to &quot;make the good popular and the popular good,&quot; once stating: &quot;damn the upper classes! They don&#x27;t even own televisions!&quot; While he did personally create populist family-entertainment-based dramas such as &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; and the science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, he also attempted to create drama that was socially relevant to those who were watching, initiating &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; anthology strand to present contemporary dramas with a social background the resonance. Says &quot;Screenonline&quot; of this development, &quot;It was from this artistic high of the &#x27;golden age&#x27; of British TV drama (this &#x27;agitational contemporaneity&#x27;, as Newman coined it) that a new generation of TV playwrights emerged.&quot;

&quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; proved to be a breeding ground for acclaimed and sometimes controversial writers such as Dennis Potter and directors such as Ken Loach, but sometimes Newman&#x27;s desire to create biting, cutting drama could land the Corporation in trouble. This was particularly the case with 1965&#x27;s &quot;The War Game&quot; by Peter Watkins, which depicted a fictional nuclear attack on the UK and the consequences of such, and was banned by the BBC under pressure from the government. It was eventually screened on television in 1985.

Newman&#x27;s reign saw a large number of popular and critically acclaimed dramas go out on the BBC, with &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Doctor Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; and the epic &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; picking up viewers while the likes of &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; and &quot;Theatre 625&quot; presented challenging ideas to the audience. Newman left the staff of the BBC once his five-year contract expired in 1967, departing for an unsuccessful attempt to break into the film industry. He was replaced by Head of Serials Shaun Sutton, initially on an acting basis combined with his existing role, but permanently from 1969. 

Sutton became the BBC&#x27;s longest-serving Head of Drama, serving as such until 1981 and during the BBC&#x27;s move from black and white into colour broadcasting. His era took in the whole of the 1970s, a time when the BBC enjoyed large viewing figures, positive audience reaction and generally high production values across a range of programmes, with drama enjoying a particularly well-received spell. &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; transformed into the equally celebrated and longer running &quot;Play for Today&quot; in 1970; later in the decade the BBC began a run of producing every single Shakespeare play, a run which Sutton himself would later take over the producer&#x27;s role on following his departure from the Head of Drama position in the early 1980s.

Popular dramas such as &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Z-Cars&quot; continued into the new decade, and were joined by costume dramas following &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; such as &quot;The Pallisers&quot;, &quot;The Onedin Line&quot; and &quot;Poldark&quot;. Family-audience based period dramas, often adaptations such as &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot; (1977), were popular on Sunday afternoons, with the &#x27;Classic Serial&#x27; strand which ran there becoming something of an institution until the early 1990s. Another success between 1973 and 1977 was the popular &quot;Warship&quot; drama series, filmed with a documentary-like look for forty-five episodes over four seasons on a Royal Navy frigate. Along with many BBC dramas of the decade, &quot;Warship&quot; was also very successful in countries such as Ireland and Australia.

There were also failures, however. The epic &quot;Churchill&#x27;s People&quot;, twenty-six fifty-minute episodes based around Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot;, was deemed unbroadcastable by Sutton after he had viewed the initial episodes, but so much time and money had been invested in huge pre-transmission publicity that the BBC had no choice but to show the plays, to critical derision and tiny viewing figures. Never again would a fifty-minute series be given a run as long as twenty-six episodes, for fear of being too committed to a project: runs of thirteen became the norm, although in later years even this began to be considered quite long. Plays such as Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; and Roy Minton&#x27;s &quot;Scum&quot; were not broadcast at all due to fears over their content at the highest levels of the BBC, although despite this Potter continued to write landmark drama serials and one-offs for the Corporation throughout the rest of the decade and into the 1980s. Both &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; and &quot;Scum&quot; were eventually transmitted some years later.

Whenever writers and media analysts criticise the current state of British and particularly BBC television drama, it is frequently the 1960s and 1970s period which they cite as being the most important and influential, with a vast variety of genres (science fiction, crime, historical, family based) and types of programme (series, serials, one-offs, anthologies) being produced. &quot;What may justly be rated as the golden age of television drama reached its zenith,&quot; as &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it in their 2004 obituary of Sutton. Or in the words of the Royal Television Society, &quot;...an era that championed new writers, young directors and challenging drama. The amazing diversity... helped to make it the golden age of broadcasting.&quot;

However, despite this high esteem, much television drama of the era does not exist in the archives. The live output was generally not recorded at all, while programming from the 1960s was usually wiped for contractual reasons or perceived as being of no further use. This practice means some series are completely missing, such as &quot;United!&quot;, a football-based soap opera which ran from 1965 to 1967. Others have large gaps; &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; has only about thirty of its more than four hundred episodes surviving from its twenty-year run.

==Changing attitudes in the 1980s and beyond==
Following Sutton&#x27;s departure from the Head of Drama role in 1981 and his return to front-line producing duties in the Shakespeare cycle, his place as Head of Drama was taken by Graeme MacDonald. MacDonald had been Head of Serials and later Head of Series &amp; Serials under Sutton, with the two departments having been merged in 1980, remaining so for most of the decade before separating again at the end of it. MacDonald maintained the status quo, and was only Head of Drama for a short time before he was promoted again to run a channel as Controller of BBC2. He was succeeded in turn by his own Head of Series &amp; Serials, Jonathan Powell.

Powell had been a producer of high-quality all-film drama serials such as &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1979) and its sequel &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1982), and he very much favoured this form of short-run, self-contained filmed serial over longer-running videotaped drama series. It was under his aegis, therefore, that the BBC produced some of its highest-quality examples of this type of drama, of particular note being 1985&#x27;s &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; by Troy Kennedy Martin, and the following year&#x27;s Dennis Potter piece &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;, both regarded as seminal BBC drama productions. &quot;A gripping, innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards,&quot; was the British Film Institute&#x27;s verdict on &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; in 2000.

Powell also oversaw the rise of more populist continuing drama series, however, encouraged by the ratings-chasing strategy of the then Controller of BBC1, his friend Michael Grade. It was during Powell&#x27;s tenure that the BBC launched the twice-weekly soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1985–present) and the medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; (1986–present), both of which remain linchpins of the BBC One schedule today and the highest-rated drama productions on BBC television. Indeed, &quot;EastEnders&quot; achieved phenomenal success in its early years, its Christmas Day 1986 episode earning a massive 30.15 million viewers, the highest British television audience of the 1980s.Aside from these continuing dramas, based in one major location and shot entirely on videotape and thus comparatively cheap to make, longer runs of drama series became rare, with short series of six or eight episodes becoming the norm.

The single play, in its original studio-based form, also began to disappear from the schedules, with the final series of &quot;Play for Today&quot; airing in 1984, and the last single drama recorded at Television Centre being &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; in 1995. The BBC was envious of the success of its rival Channel 4&#x27;s newly formed film arm , which had seen made-for-television one-offs such as Stephen Frears&#x27; &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985) gain cinematic releases to considerable success. New strands such as &quot;Screen One&quot; and &quot;Screen Two&quot; concentrated on short runs of all-film, cinematic-style one-off dramas, with the most successful of these being Anthony Minghella&#x27;s &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; (&quot;Screen Two&quot;, 1990) which became a successful film released to cinemas. (&quot;Screen One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; ran until 1994.)

The Plays department eventually disappeared altogether, being replaced latterly with a &#x27;Head of Film &amp; Single Drama&#x27; position with autonomous powers for investing in feature film production, co-commissioning television one-offs with the Head of Drama. This interest in film production is perhaps best demonstrated by the fact that both of Powell&#x27;s successors as Head of Drama, Mark Shivas (1988–93) and Charles Denton (1993–96), went on to work in the film industry after leaving the position.

Another major change to BBC production methods in all areas, but particularly affecting drama, occurred the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, which amongst other things obliged the BBC to commission 25% of its output from independent production companies. Many BBC drama productions were subsequently outsourced to and commissioned from independent companies, although the BBC&#x27;s in-house production arm continued to contribute heavily, with the separate Drama Series and Serials departments remaining intact. Production arms such as costumes, make-up and special effects were all closed by the early 21st century, however, with these services now being bought in from outside even for in-house programmes.

Jonathan Powell&#x27;s attempt to repeat the success of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1992, when he had become Controller of BBC One, led to one of the BBC&#x27;s most notorious and costly failures. &quot;Eldorado&quot; was set in the British expatriate community in Spain, created by the same team of Julia Smith and Tony Holland who had come up with &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The costly soap opera, hugely maligned by critics and the victim of a viewer backlash against the massive advertising campaign the BBC had undertaken to promote it, was scrapped by Powell&#x27;s successor Alan Yentob after less than a year&#x27;s run, under pressure from the Director-General of the BBC John Birt.

The 1990s saw a rise in the popularity of costume drama adaptations of literary classics, mostly adapted by the acclaimed screenwriter Andrew Davies. One of the most successful of these was a 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Contemporary social drama, a BBC signature style since the 1960s, remained in the form of landmark productions such as &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996), but it was notable that this was transmitted on the more niche BBC Two channel rather than the mainstream BBC One as might well have been the case in previous decades.

There was criticism of the department&#x27;s commissioning process in some quarters, which was seen as being overly intricate and bureaucratic. As &quot;The Independent&quot; described: &quot;Lengthy agonising over whether the BBC1 saga &quot;Seaforth&quot; would be given a second series (eventually, it wasn&#x27;t) further encouraged the view that the BBC&#x27;s management floor is full of desks where the buck does not so much stop as hang around for a few months.&quot; Further problems emerged for the drama department after the departure of Charles Denton as its Head in May 1996. He was briefly replaced on a temporary basis by Ruth Caleb, the Head of Drama at BBC Wales. However, Caleb had no interest in taking the job on a permanent basis, and after a six-month attachment left the post at the end of the year. With no suitable candidate to take the job on a full-time basis having been found, Director of Television Alan Yentob was forced to oversee the department, again on a temporary basis.

There was much criticism in the press over the inability of the BBC to find a full-time Head of Drama, with even the BBC Chairman Sir Christopher Bland criticising the amount of time it was taking to find a new Head of Department, stating publicly that: &quot;There aren&#x27;t a lot of people who are pre-eminently qualified and able to do the biggest job in drama. That&#x27;s the difficulty.&quot; . Experienced BBC Drama staff such as Michael Wearing (Head of Serials) were leaving the department, which was seen to be in trouble after the failure of hugely expensive productions such as the historical drama &quot;Rhodes&quot; in 1996. &quot;Many in the drama business, and not just BBC insiders, are worried about the hand-over of creative say to the controllers, low morale and the lack of a head,&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in December 1996. Finally in June 1997 Colin Adams was appointed as the new Head of Drama. Adams was a surprising choice, his previous role at the Corporation having been as Head of Northern Broadcasting. However, he was essentially an administrator and seen by Drama staff as a temporary appointment.

In 1997 the BBC approached Mal Young, best known for producing Liverpool-set Channel 4 soap &quot;Brookside&quot;, to head up the Drama Series section of the in-house Drama Department, which had become something of a poisoned chalice with many Controllers departing in quick succession. As Controller of Continuing Drama Series, Young oversaw the move to volume production and also commissioned a new medical Series, &quot;Holby City&quot;. By the time Young left the BBC to join 19 Television Limited as head of Drama in December 2004, the BBC had increased Series production to nearly 300 hours per annum, including &quot;EastEnders&quot; at four times a week, &quot;Holby City&quot; for 52 episodes, &quot;Casualty&quot; for 48 episodes. Volume Series production was a controversial move because it took a large part of the Drama budget away from original production and contributed to accusations of &quot;dumbing down&quot; its programming. &quot;The decision to show &quot;EastEnders&quot; four nights a week, followed by &quot;Holby City&quot; has left the corporation open to accusations that the BBC1 schedule has been cleared for a diet of &#x27;precinct pulp&#x27;,&quot; reported &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003.

==The modern era==
As of 2010, the current Commissioner of Drama at the BBC is Ben Stephenson. Working with Stephenson are: Head of Series &amp; Serials Kate Harwood and Controller of Continuing (i.e. year-round) Drama Series John Yorke (who also acts as Head of Drama for the BBC&#x27;s in-house production arm), with David M. Thompson of Film &amp; Single Drama overseeing one-offs. Sarah Brandist and Polly Hill are the commissioning editors for independently-produced drama programming.

Having been Head of Serials from 1997 to 2000, Jane Tranter was made Head of Drama in 2000. Tranter&#x27;s era from 2000–06 saw a return to longer-run episode series, with programmes such as &quot;Spooks&quot; being given longer second runs following successful debut seasons. Recent years have also seen a huge increase in continuing drama output, with &quot;EastEnders&quot; gaining a fourth weekly episode to add to the third added during the mid-1990s, and &quot;Casualty&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;Holby City&quot; (1999–present) turning from regular seasonal shows to year-round soap opera-style productions. These moves have been criticised in some quarters for filling the market with insubstantial populist dramas at the expense of &#x27;quality&#x27; prestige pieces, although there have been several notable drama serial successes, such as Paul Abbott&#x27;s &quot;State of Play&quot; (2003) and the historical drama &quot;Charles II: The Power and The Passion&quot; (BBC Northern Ireland - 2004).

Another move of recent years has been the regionalisation of BBC drama, in response to criticisms that the majority of programmes were made and set in and around London and the surrounding areas, with the BBC&#x27;s central drama department currently being based at Television Centre in West London. As far back at 1962, the makers of &quot;Z-Cars&quot; had deliberately set their programme near Liverpool in the North of England to break away from the perceived London bias (although, ironically, it was shot in the BBC&#x27;s London studios), and in 1971 an English Regions Drama Department had been established at BBC Birmingham headed by David Rose with a remit for making &#x27;regional drama&#x27;, gaining a major success with Alan Bleasdale&#x27;s &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; in 1982. In the modern era, however, the separate BBC branches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own drama departments with Heads of Drama who have autonomous commissioning powers, both for in-house production and co-production with or commissioning from independents.

Although some of these shows are purely for regional consumption, such as BBC Scotland&#x27;s &quot;River City&quot; and BBC Wales&#x27; &quot;Belonging&quot;, many programmes networked nationally on BBC One and Two are made in &#x27;the nations&#x27;, with perhaps the highest profile being the current BBC Wales revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The larger English regions also produce drama productions of their own, with BBC Birmingham providing the detective drama &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, daytime soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; and anthology series &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot; for national consumption, for example.

From 1999 until 2006, the BBC also had a new in-house drama division, BBC Fictionlab, headed up by Richard Fell, which specialised in producing dramas for the corporation&#x27;s digital stations, particularly BBC Four. Notable Fictionlab productions for BBC Four included &quot;The Alan Clark Diaries&quot; (2003), a live re-make of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (2005) and the biopic &quot;Kenneth Tynan - In Praise of Hardcore&quot; (2005). Several of these have later seen analogue transmission on BBC Two. However, in January 2006 the BBC announced that Fictionlab was to be disbanded, as the digital channels were now well established and no longer needed a specialised drama production unit.

In the 2010s, BBC drama costs up to £1 million per hour for &quot;premium&quot; dramas by independent production companies.

==Children&#x27;s drama==
The BBC has established a strong reputation in the field of children&#x27;s drama, although children&#x27;s dramas are almost universally commissioned and / or produced by the BBC&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Department rather than the Drama Department itself. There are however occasional crossovers - &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, for example, would commonly be regarded as a children&#x27;s or family programme, but has always been produced by the main Drama Department.

Throughout much of the department&#x27;s history, the emphasis has been on continuing productions of short-run drama serials, including adaptations of classic children&#x27;s literature such as &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, as well as made-for-television productions. Science-fiction has been a popular theme, from &quot;Stranger from Space&quot; (1951–52) through to the likes of &quot;Dark Season&quot; (1991) and &quot;Century Falls&quot; (1993). Since the middle of the 1980s, children&#x27;s dramas - with the exception of the Sunday evening &#x27;classics&#x27; slot - have almost always been screened in the weekday BBC One 3pm-5.30pm &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC&quot; (CBBC) strand.

Longer continuing drama series became common from the late 1970s, spearheaded by the 1978 launch of the popular school-set drama series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;. Created by Liverpudlian dramatist Phil Redmond, the intention of the programme was to present issues relevant to children in a realistic manner, showing characters in a modern Comprehensive school and concentrating on the issues facing children in such schools. The series was a huge success, and in 1989 a similar programme, &quot;Byker Grove&quot;, set in a youth club, was launched by the BBC&#x27;s North-Eastern arm and screened on Children&#x27;s BBC.

From the 1990s onwards, in common with BBC programming in other genres, children&#x27;s drama has often been commissioned from independent producers as well as being made in-house. &quot;Grange Hill&quot; switched to independent production after twenty-five years as an in-house programme in 2003, when production was taken over by Mersey Television, the company established by the programme&#x27;s creator Phil Redmond in the early 1980s. Co-productions with foreign broadcasters are also common, with BBC Scotland&#x27;s successful 2004 fantasy drama &quot;Shoebox Zoo&quot; being made in collaboration with the Canadian company Blueprint Entertainment.

As of 2005, the BBC continues to broadcast children&#x27;s drama, usually in the weekday afternoon CBBC slot, but also occasional Sunday early evening / late afternoon prestige productions such as the adaptation of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (April 2005).

<doc id="947096" wikidata="Q7815386" url="?curid=947096" title="Tom Connolly (umpire)">
<text>Thomas Henry Connolly (December 31, 1870 – April 28, 1961) was an English-American umpire in Major League Baseball. He officiated in the National League from 1898 to 1900, followed by 31 years of service in the American League from 1901 to 1931. In over half a century as an American League umpire and supervisor, he established the high standards for which the circuit&#x27;s arbiters became known, and solidified the reputation for integrity of umpires in the major leagues.

==Early life==
Connolly was born in Manchester, England, and played cricket as a boy. It was not until his family emigrated to the United States in 1885, settling in Natick, Massachusetts, that he saw the game of baseball played for the first time, but he was quickly fascinated and resolved himself to learning as much about the game as he could. He immersed himself in the rule book, and within a few years was umpiring for local games. While working in YMCA games, he was discovered by major league umpire Tim Hurst, who obtained a position for Connolly in the New England League, where he umpired from 1894 to 1897.

==MLB career==
In 1898, the National League (NL) brought Connolly up to the majors, but he was angered by the league president&#x27;s reluctance to back up umpires&#x27; decisions on the field, and resigned in the middle of the 1900 season, then signed with the fledgling American League (AL) in 1901. That league&#x27;s president, Ban Johnson, was eager to create a reputation for the AL as a solid challenger to the NL, and he gave umpires a greater measure of support than they had previously received, demonstrating that attacks upon umpires would not be tolerated and that their judgment was final. On April 24, 1901, Connolly had the privilege of umpiring, as its sole arbiter, the first AL game ever played.

Although he had begun his career by showing that he was willing to remove players from the field — he ejected more than 10 in his first AL season — he came to earn great respect from the players, and once went 5 full seasons (1925–1929) without ejecting a player. He also showed an ability to stand firm against the toughest players in defense of the rules; on September 11, 1912, he called Ty Cobb out for stepping across home plate while batting, after Cobb had batted in a run during an attempted intentional walk. During the ensuing argument, Connolly was struck in the mouth by a bottle thrown by a spectator. His reputation earned him prominent game assignments, including the first AL games ever played at Comiskey Park, Shibe Park, Fenway Park, and Yankee Stadium. Connolly was also the sole AL umpire chosen to work in the first World Series in 1903.
In 1931, new AL president Will Harridge was concerned about widespread complaints that the quality of umpiring in the league had deteriorated, and Connolly retired from active field work to become the league&#x27;s first supervisor of umpires. Traveling throughout the league to work with other umpires and ensure that everyone&#x27;s work was meeting the same high standards, he remained in that post until 1954, and came to be known as the nation&#x27;s foremost expert on baseball rules.

In his career, Connolly worked in an AL-record eight World Series: 1903, 1908 (even-numbered games), 1910, 1911, 1913, 1916, 1920 and 1924. He was also the home plate umpire for Addie Joss&#x27; perfect game on October 2, 1908, one of four no-hitters in which he called balls and strikes.

==Later life==
Connolly was named in the Honor Rolls of Baseball in 1946, and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953, one of the first two umpires (the NL&#x27;s Bill Klem was the other) given that honor. Connolly and Klem are the only two umpires in history to have worked in five decades; Connolly&#x27;s record of 31 years umpiring American League games was broken by Larry Barnett in 1999.

Connolly died in 1961 at age 90 in Natick, Massachusetts, survived by seven children, and predeceased by his wife, who had died in 1943.

<doc id="947100" wikidata="Q192377" url="?curid=947100" title="João Figueiredo">
<text>João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo (; 15 January 1918 – 24 December 1999) was a Brazilian military leader and dictator who served as the 30th president of Brazil from 1979 to 1985, the last of the military regime that ruled the country following the 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état. He was chief of the Secret Service (SNI) during the term of his predecessor, Ernesto Geisel, who appointed him to the presidency at the end of his own term.

Figueiredo’s presidency continued the political liberalization started under Geisel. Shortly after taking office, he approved a broad amnesty for politicians who had been removed from office under institutional acts. In 1980, the two-party system was abolished, leading to the creation of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) as the successor to the MDB and the Democratic Social Party (PDS) as the successor to ARENA, along with several new parties. Figueiredo joined the PDS. On September 22, 1981, he was awarded Portugal’s Grand Collar of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword. In 1982, electoral reforms were introduced to secure a majority for the ruling PDS in the upcoming elections against four opposition parties. However, his presidency saw several terrorist attacks attributed to hardline right-wing and military factions. 

Figueiredo’s term was marked by a severe global economic crisis, rising international interest rates, the second oil shock of 1979, and skyrocketing inflation, which surged from 45% to 230% over six years. Brazil’s foreign debt exceeded $100 billion for the first time, forcing the government to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 1982. That same year, the state of Rondônia was created. In 1983, the &quot;Diretas Já&quot; movement pushed for direct presidential elections, but the proposal was rejected by Congress. However, the Figueiredo administration allowed an indirect presidential election, ultimately leading to the end of Brazil’s military regime.

According to CIA documents, João Figueiredo supported the continuation of summary executions of political dissidents, in violation of legal and constitutional norms, as well as human rights principles.

==Biography==

João Baptista de Oliveira Figueiredo was born in Rio de Janeiro at 11:30 BRT on 15 January 1918. He was the son of General Euclides Figueiredo and Valentina Silva de Oliveira Figueiredo, the third of six siblings.

His father was exiled for trying to topple the Estado Novo regime of Getúlio Vargas in 1938. Two of his brothers were also generals. The family could trace its origins in Brazil to the 1650s, having arrived from Barcelos in Northern Portugal and owning several slaves and sugar plantations. After studying at military schools of Porto Alegre and Realengo, Figueiredo was promoted to captain (1944) and to major (1952). He served as the Brazilian military attache in Paraguay (1955–1957) and worked for secret service of the Army General Staff (1959–1960). In 1961 he was transferred to the National Security Council. While teaching at the Army General Staff Command College (1961–1964), Figueiredo was promoted to colonel and appointed the department head in the National Information Service. In 1966 he assumed the command of public defense force in São Paulo. In 1967–1969 he commanded a regiment in Rio de Janeiro and was promoted to general. When General Emílio Garrastazu Médici assumed the presidency, Figueiredo was appointed head of the president&#x27;s military staff (30 October 1969 – 15 March 1974).

In 1974 he assumed the leadership of the National Intelligence Service of Brazil (15 March 1974 – 14 June 1978), a Brazil&#x27;s internal security agency. Picked by President Ernesto Geisel as his successor, Figueiredo campaigned vigorously, even though he could not possibly be defeated; the president was elected by a legislature dominated by the pro-military National Renewal Alliance Party. As expected, he won easily against the nominal opposition candidate, General Monteiro.

As president, he continued the gradual &quot;abertura&quot; (democratization) process instituted in 1974. An amnesty law, signed by Figueiredo on 28 August 1979, amnestied those convicted of &quot;political or related&quot; crimes between 1961 and 1978. In the early 1980s, the military regime could no longer effectively maintain the two-party system established in 1966. The Figueiredo administration dissolved the government-controlled National Renewal Alliance Party (ARENA) and allowed new parties to be formed. In 1981 the Congress enacted a law to restore direct elections of state governors. The general election of 1982 brought victory to ARENA&#x27;s successor, the pro-government Democratic Social Party (43.22% of the vote), and to the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (42.96%).

The governorship of three major states, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, was won by the opposition. However, political developments were overshadowed by economic problems. As inflation and unemployment soared, the foreign debt reached massive proportions making Brazil the world&#x27;s biggest debtor owing about US$90 billion to international lenders. The austerity program imposed by the government brought no signs of recovery for the Brazilian economy until the end of Figueiredo&#x27;s term. The president had a heart attack and injuries from horse riding and took two prolonged leaves for health treatment in 1981 and 1983, but civilian vice president Antônio Aureliano Chaves de Mendonça did not enjoy major political power. The opposition vigorously struggled to pass a constitutional amendment that would allow direct popular Presidential elections in November 1984, but the proposal failed to win passage in the Congress. The opposition candidate Tancredo Neves succeeded Figueiredo when Congress held an election for the new president. 

===Post presidency and death===
After his presidency, Figueiredo did not return to politics and lived away from public attention. He would live his last years in his apartment in São Conrado, in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. At 9:35 BRST on 24 December 1999, at the age of 81, Figueredo died due to kidney and heart failure. After his death President Fernando Henrique Cardoso declared three days of mourning. He is buried in the Caju Cemetery in Rio de Janeiro.

<doc id="947103" wikidata="Q7935866" url="?curid=947103" title="Viscount Windsor">
<text>Viscount Windsor is a title that has been created twice.

The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1699 when the Honourable Thomas Windsor was made &quot;Viscount Windsor, of Blackcastle&quot;. He was the younger son of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, and notably represented Droitwich, Bramber and Monmouthshire in the House of Commons. In 1712, he was created &quot;Baron Mountjoy&quot; in the Peerage of Great Britain, giving him a seat in the House of Lords at Westminster, one of Harley&#x27;s Dozen. Windsor was a descendant of Andrew Windsor, 1st Baron Windsor and the Honourable Elizabeth Blount, sister of Edward Blount, 2nd Baron Mountjoy, hence his choice of title (see also Baron Mountjoy). He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He sat as Member of Parliament for Cardiff. On his death in 1758, the titles became extinct. His daughter and heiress, the Honourable Charlotte Jane Windsor, married John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute. In 1796, he was created Viscount Mountjoy, Earl of Windsor and Marquess of Bute.

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1905 when Robert Windsor-Clive, 14th Baron Windsor, was made &quot;Viscount Windsor, of St Fagans in the County of Glamorgan&quot;. He was made Earl of Plymouth at the same time. For more information on this creation of the viscountcy, see the latter title.

<doc id="947104" wikidata="Q59167" url="?curid=947104" title="Zündapp">
<text>Zündapp (a.k.a. Zuendapp) was a major German motorcycle manufacturer founded in 1917 in Nuremberg by Fritz Neumeyer, together with the Friedrich Krupp AG and the machine tool manufacturer Thiel under the name &quot;Zünder- und Apparatebau G.m.b.H.&quot; as a producer of detonators (Zünder- und Apparatebau is German for Igniter and Apparatus). In 1919, as the demand for weapons parts declined after World War I, Neumeyer became the sole proprietor of the company, and two years later he diversified into the construction of motorcycles.

Following World War II, Zündapp expanded into the microcar, moped and scooter markets. The company collapsed in 1984.

== Early history: 1919–45 ==


The first Zündapp motorcycle was the model Z22 in 1921. This was the &quot;Motorrad für Jedermann&quot; (&quot;motorcycle for everyone&quot;), a simple, reliable design that was produced in large series. Zündapp&#x27;s history of heavy motorcycles began in 1933 with the K-series. The &quot;K&quot; refers to the type of drivetrain that these models used, &quot;Kardanantrieb&quot;, meaning enclosed driveshaft with two universal joints. Zündapp introduced the enclosed crankcase (then a novelty). The series encompassed models from 200 to 800 cc displacement and was a major success, increasing Zündapp&#x27;s market share in Germany from 5% in 1931 to 18% in 1937.

The Zündapp KS600, first released in 1938, had a horizontally opposed twin cylinder engine with overhead valves displacing . The KS600 was often coupled with a Steib sidecar, the BW38 (&quot;Beiwagen&quot; 1938). The BW38, fitted with the B1 (Boot no. 1) sidecar body was produced between 1938 and 1941 and supplied exclusively to the Wehrmacht. While the KS600 was discontinued and eventually replaced by the purpose-built KS750, its motor was to be the only remnant to live beyond the destruction of war. When Zündapp returned to motorcycle production in the late 1940s, it chose to reuse the KS600&#x27;s motor to power the KS601 with few modifications.

The Zündapp K800 had unit construction, flat-four engines with shaft drive (a layout adopted by Honda for the Gold Wing in 1974) and were the only 4-cylinder machines used by the German armed forces in World War II.

From 1931 Ferdinand Porsche and Zündapp developed the type 12 prototype &quot;Auto für Jedermann&quot; (&quot;car for everyone&quot;), which was the first time the name Volkswagen was used. Porsche preferred the 4-cylinder flat engine, but Zündapp used a water-cooled 5-cylinder radial engine. In 1932 three prototypes were running. All three cars were lost during the war, the last in a 1945 Stuttgart bombing raid.

From 1936 to 1938 Zündapp produced the KKS500 model. This was the first Zündapp with a foot gear change, and 170 examples were built. From 1940 onward Zündapp produced more than 18,000 units of the Zündapp KS 750. This is a sidecar outfit with a driven side wheel and a locking differential, supplied to the German Wehrmacht.

Zündapp also made aircraft engines including the 9-092, which was used in light aircraft, including the Braunschweig LF-1 Zaunkönig (1942) &quot;ab initio&quot; trainer aircraft.

==Postwar: 1945–1984==

After World War II the company transitioned to smaller machines, notably the &quot;Bella&quot; motor scooter, which was a relatively heavy machine for its type. In 1951 Zündapp released the last of its heavy motorcycle models, but one of its most famous: the KS601 (the &quot;green elephant&quot;) with a 598 cc two-cylinder engine. From 1957 to 1958 the company also produced the Zündapp Janus microcar.

In 1958 the company moved from Nuremberg to Munich. Subsequently, the company developed several new smaller models, discontinued the development of four-stroke engines and only produced two-stroke models. Zündapp experienced enormous success in off-road motorsports winning thousands of Gold-Silver and bronze medals, many Championships.
The American rider Dave Ekins won an overall victory at the 1967 Greenhorn Enduro aboard a 100cc Zündapp, defeating competitors on much larger motorcycles. Belgian rider André Malherbe rode a Zündapp to win the 125cc European motocross championships in 1973 and again in 1974. Initially, Zündapp scooters and mopeds sold well, but later sales declined and in 1984 the company went bankrupt and closed. New legislation had destroyed the market for Zündapps high-speed 50 cc &quot;Kleinkrafträder&quot;: to reduce noise and to reduce the accidents especially young riders had on those bikes, the new &quot;80 cc&quot; class was introduced. That made it much easier especially for the Japanese manufacturers to break into the previously protected market as they could easily downsize the 125 cc engines. Kreidler shared Zündapp&#x27;s fate and went insolvent in 1982.

==Post bankruptcy==
After the bankruptcy, the entire production line and intellectual properties were bought by Xunda Motor Co., Tianjin, China. They produced small Zündapp motorcycles from 1987 until the early 1990s. Zündapp later produced Honda-based four-stroke motorcycles and electric mopeds in the 2010s.

Zündapp also had a technical collaboration with Royal Enfield (India) to build mopeds and motorcycles. A dedicated factory was built at Ranipet near Madras (now Chennai) in the early 1980s to manufacture small, lightweight two-stroke motorcycles to be offered along with their flagship Royal Enfield Bullet. Enfield launched two 50 cc motorcycles first, the step-thru Silver Plus and the three-speed Explorer motorcycle. Later, Enfield Fury 175 (based on Zündapp KS175) was introduced as a performance motorcycle. It had five-speed gearbox, a hydraulic Brembo disc brake and a sleeveless hard chromed cylinder barrel, all were a first on a motorcycle in that country. That being said, sales of these models were very low in the country.

In 2017, the Zündapp name returned to German hands after being purchased by Dieter Neumeyer, the grandson of company founder Fritz Neumeyer. The newly owned company subsequently produced e-bicycles and later revealed a new motorcycle concept, the ZXA 500 Adventure, at the 2022 Intermot Show in Cologne.

<text>Beth-Nimrah or Beth-nimrah (), also called Nimrin and Bethennabris, was an ancient city in Transjordan, which features prominently the history of ancient Israel and Judah. Tell Nimrin has been identified by Nelson Glueck as the last of three sites successively occupied by the ancient city.

==Etymology==
Beth Nimrah means &#x27;house of a leopard&#x27; in Hebrew, &quot;beit&quot; meaning &#x27;house&#x27; and &quot;namer&quot; &#x27;leopard&#x27; (cf. &quot;nimr&quot; in Arabic).

Later in antiquity, the city took on the name Nimrin, until its demise in the first century CE. In Talmudic literature, it is mentioned as Nimrin or Nimri.

The name is preserved in the names Tell Nimrin (for the archaeological mound) and Wadi Nimrin (for the wadi-type valley). Glueck suggests a possible connection between Wadi Nimrin and the biblical &quot;Waters of Nimrim&quot; ( and ), although he identifies &quot;this stream&quot; with Seil en-Numeirah (not clear if he refers by &quot;this stream&quot; to Seil en-Numeirah, or to Jeremiah&#x27;s &quot;Waters of Nimrim&quot;). Seil en-Numeira is a stream that flows into the Dead Sea at its southern end.

==Location==
The city was located in the Jordan Valley, approximately north of the Dead Sea and east of Jericho. Wadi Nimrin, on whose south (left) bank all the three sites identified by Glueck with Beth Nimra are located, marks the northern limit of the Plains of Moab.

The ancient city was believed by Glueck to have moved twice in its history, occupying successively three mounds: Tell el-Mustaḥ during the Early Bronze I, Tell Bleibil in Iron Age I-II, and Tell Nimrin in the Roman through to the Early Muslim period, with similar large historical sedentary habitation gaps as those encountered elsewhere across the Jordan Valley. Glueck based his dates on sherds found at the surface and, in the case of Tell el-Mustah and Tell Nimrin, in cuts caused by modern roads.

Tell el-Mustah rises south of Wadi Sha&#x27;ib (Wadi Shu&#x27;ayb in more recent spelling), which is the name of an easterly section of the same wadi which takes on the name Wadi Nimrin when it reaches Tell Nimrin. Tell Bleibil is just across the wadi from Tell el-Mustah, so on the north side of Wadi Sha&#x27;ib. Tell el-Mustah stands c. 1.75 km ENE of Tell Nimrin, both being located on the south side of the wadi. The tells of Mustah and Bleibil are in the foothills flanking the plain of Nimrin from the east, while Nimrin is further down the slope. Glueck describes Tell Nimrin in 1943 as being situated very close to the east of the Arab village of Shuneh (now Ash-Shunah al-Janubiyah or South Shuneh). About Tell Nimrin, see also Alexander Ahrens&#x27; Wadi Shuʿayb Archaeological Survey (2018).

==Hebrew Bible==
It was assigned to the Tribe of Gad (). In the Book of Joshua it was said to have belonged formerly to the kingdom of Sihon ().

==History==
===Persian period===
In the 4th century BCE, the city was settled by Israelites who had returned from the Babylonian exile and marked the furthest extent eastward of Jewish settlement in Transjordan.

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
In c. 65 CE, the village was the site of a fierce battle during the First Jewish–Roman War under Vespasian, which saw the defeat of the town&#x27;s defenders. The non-combatants were exterminated, the able-bodied fled, the houses were ransacked by the soldiery, and the village set on fire.

The town is also mentioned in the Mosaic of Rehob, which was laid sometimes between the late 3rd and the 6th/7th centuries CE.

<doc id="947124" wikidata="Q6045661" url="?curid=947124" title="Interceptor (game show)">
<text>Interceptor is a British game show created by Jacques Antoine, Jean Jacques Pasquier and Malcolm Heyworth. It was produced by Chatsworth in association with Thames and shown on the ITV network during the summer of 1989, with one last episode held back and shown on 1 January 1990 for a New Year special. It was made in between &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; and &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;, game shows from the same production company.

The show was hosted by former tennis player and &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; sky-runner Annabel Croft. The eponymous Interceptor was played by actor Sean O&#x27;Kane.

Only eight episodes (one series) were made (after an un-aired test pilot). It was re-run on digital TV channel Challenge many times between 2001 and 2015. A public vote on UKGameshows in 2002 saw the series voted the UK&#x27;s 13th best game show.

==Format==
Each episode of the series was based, like &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; in a region of the UK and began from a local tourist attraction. The host, Annabel Croft, would introduce the episode&#x27;s two contestants, one woman (the yellow contestant) and one man (the blue contestant). Each contestant would be given a locked backpack - one would contain £1,000 in cash, the other containing nothing but weights. Both backpacks had five large infrared receptors on the back. The contestants would be blindfolded and taken by helicopter to locations in the area. The challenge was for both contestants, under radio guidance from Croft, to obtain the key to their opposite number&#x27;s backpack - usually, some distance away from their start point - and meet up, all within a 40-minute time limit.

The task was simple enough, except for some obstructions placed in their way. Principal among these was the titular Interceptor, a tall man dressed in black, armed with an infra-red projector mounted on his left forearm (the technology for which was procured from the British Army), and possessed of an intimidating fish-eagle screech and a catchphrase, &quot;I LIKE IT!&quot; whenever he spotted a contestant from his helicopter or if he won at the end of an episode. His role was to pursue the contestants and - to the accompaniment of post-production sound effects - &#x27;zap&#x27; the receptors on their backpacks, causing the locks to jam. Thus, if the contestant carrying the money is &#x27;zapped&#x27;, neither contestant wins. (Although not declared in the programme, the Interceptor was only allowed a maximum of 20 &quot;zaps&quot; per show, and had a digital readout on his laser projector which informed him of how many shots he had left).

Distance was also a major enemy to the contestant, causing them to ask or borrow any mode of transport available to them. During the course of the series, more or less everything from bicycles to Sea King helicopters were used. The Interceptor, too, was able to hijack available transportation, but had his own fleet available to him. The most-used of these was his black-and-yellow Agusta A109 helicopter registered G-MEAN, piloted by his long-suffering pilot &#x27;Mikey&#x27; (played by helicopter pilot Michael Malric-Smith). Also, at his disposal, was a Maserati Biturbo Spyder sports car registration INT 1, and a Kawasaki ZX10 motorbike registration INT 2. There was also an offroad Kawasaki KMX200 motorbike available with the registration INT 3 but was never used and only seen at the Interceptors lair in a few episodes. It was also claimed that a hovercraft was available to him, though, this was never used. The INT number plates were not real; the producers had special permission to film whilst using them.

The contestants&#x27; other major enemy was the time limit. Once they had located their key, they often had to perform a task in order to obtain it. Examples included participating in a limited jousting exercise, or removing the key from a horse&#x27;s braided mane.

==Airing==
The eight episodes were recorded over the summer of 1989 and shown soon afterwards. The first seven episodes were aired on a Wednesday. The only exception was the eighth and final episode, which was intended for a Christmas airing but was instead shown in the New Year. This episode included seasonal greetings from both Annabel and the Interceptor.

==Cancellation==
&quot;Interceptor&quot; was shown at the time when ITV was undergoing major changes, and it became a casualty of them. &quot;Interceptor&quot; was never recommissioned for a subsequent series. While ITV franchise Thames wanted to propose &quot;Interceptor&quot; for another ITV network commission in 1990, Thames was already responsible for a very large section of ITV&#x27;s prime-time shows and other companies wanted a greater proportion. A new round of franchise bidding was impending, and Thames was concerned to improve its profitability; &quot;Interceptor&quot; was a relatively expensive show and was made by an independent contractor. In the event, Thames lost its franchise to Carlton which had put in a larger bid.

No further series of the programme were made and on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1992, Thames lost its franchise, being replaced by Carlton on New Year&#x27;s Day 1993. Thames continued as an independent production company.

==Repeats==
Despite its termination, &quot;Interceptor&quot; retains a cult following. Pressure exerted by fans led to digital TV channel Challenge repeating the series occasionally from 2001 to 2015 alongside other game shows, among which were stablemates &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot; and &quot;The Crystal Maze&quot;.

==Memorable moments==

===Episode 1: Kent===
Contestant Mark had to get his key from a hive of bees. The Interceptor chased contestant Candy (who was traveling in a Rolls-Royce) on horseback. Towards the end of the episode, the Interceptor successfully snuck up on an oblivious Mark and zapped his backpack at point-blank range. After doing so, he screamed into his ear. Ironically, the vehicles both contestants were traveling in actually passed each other with seconds to go. Even if they had realised and stopped the vehicles, they wouldn&#x27;t have won the money as, although Candy&#x27;s backpack opened, Mark&#x27;s backpack had been zapped with the money in it. As it ended up, Mark and Candy did not meet up within the 40-minute time limit anyway.

First broadcast on 19 July 1989.

===Episode 2: Norfolk===
While contestant Roger tried to get his key in the middle of a maze garden in Somerleyton Hall, the Interceptor planned an ambush. However, Roger got away before the Interceptor could zap him. Contestant Claire taunted the Interceptor from a train then went on a pleasure cruise to get near her key on the River Yare as Roger approached. The Interceptor hijacked a boat and attempted to stop them, but Roger and Claire met up within the time limit - they had well over a minute still to go - and won the £1,000, which was in Roger&#x27;s backpack; in fact, it turned out the Interceptor had failed to zap either backpack. The Interceptor was also arrested by the police because he went over the speed limit on the river.

First broadcast on 26 July 1989.

===Episode 3: Wye Valley===
Contestant Mark enlisted the help of the army to find his key, and his partner Sue later used a canoe to collect her key from under a bridge. The episode ended with the Interceptor screeching over the bridge in his Maserati while Mark and Sue struggled to find each other. Unfortunately, although the two contestants met up with 1 minute remaining, the Interceptor had zapped both their backpacks (the money was in Sue&#x27;s backpack).

First broadcast on 2 August 1989.

===Episode 4: Cumbria===
Contestant Max made his way on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway to his key challenge and the Interceptor climbed along the train in pursuit of Max. Contestant Suzanne got soaked in Wast Water while trying to get her key. At the end of the episode, the Interceptor blocked the entrance to the Eskdale Outward Bound Centre where contestant Suzanne was coming but her partner Max grabbed her just in time before the Interceptor, with only 6 seconds remaining. The two contestants won the money, which was in Suzanne&#x27;s backpack (additionally, it turned out that the Interceptor had also failed to zap Max&#x27;s backpack).

First broadcast on 9 August 1989.

===Episode 5: Derbyshire===
Contestant Martin had a brief chase with The Interceptor but got away in the nick of time. Contestant Hillary was unaware that she was taken on a ride in a tractor by the Interceptor. The farmers at the farm where she got the tractor even go as far as helping him, all because, of a money bribe of ten pounds, and a further ten pounds if his ambush was a success. When he locked Hillary&#x27;s pack, he shrieked many times and yelled in joy, only for Hillary to jump on a nearby van, jokingly threatening to hit The Interceptor with a spade if he didn&#x27;t leave her alone. Nevertheless, the ambush effort was futile, as the contestants failed to meet each other within the 40-minute time limit; as it happened, even had they succeeded in meeting up within the time limit, it would have been in vain, as, although Martin&#x27;s backpack opened, Hilary&#x27;s zapped backpack contained the money.

First broadcast on 16 August 1989.

===Episode 6: Scottish Borders===
The Interceptor wouldn&#x27;t leave contestant Mike alone as he got his key from the top of a factory in a quarry, but while attempting an ambush, he was spotted by Mike and gave up. Contestant Sarah cycled down from her starting position to get to her key challenge on a river, only to see the Interceptor nearby in a dinghy. Mike and Sarah narrowly failed to meet up within the 40-minute time limit; and unfortunately, as it turned out, the Interceptor had also failed to zap either backpack, so the contestants would have won the £1,000, which was in Sarah&#x27;s backpack.

First broadcast on 23 August 1989.

===Episode 7: Cotswolds===
Contestant Marcel had to escape the chasing Interceptor by quadbike. Contestant Nikki was taken to her key in the Fire Service College at the top of a burning building and when he started chasing her on foot she finds a way to escape quicker and the Interceptor lost her and at the end of the episode, Marcel was getting his key on a chariot race and the Interceptor was ready to zap him but he was too late as the contestants met with 28 seconds left. The contestants also won the £1,000 prize money as Nikki&#x27;s backpack, which had the money in it, opened - and, as it happened, the Interceptor had in fact failed to zap Marcel&#x27;s backpack as well.

First broadcast on 30 August 1989.

===Episode 8: Cornwall===
Contestant Clive was successfully ambushed by the Interceptor and had his backpack zapped from point-blank range; but he came up with a plan to save his partner Sarah from the Interceptor on a lifeboat. Contestant Sarah had a mini hovercraft ride before coming with the Interceptor but was protected by locals. Clive had arranged for a RAF helicopter to come and get her to meet him at the lifeboat but in a dramatic chase, the Interceptor&#x27;s and the RAF helicopter both raced to reach Sarah. The episode was memorable for the Interceptor going to the extreme of going up to Sarah&#x27;s face, shrieking, shooting his infra-red gun only for the locals to protect her. Clive and Sarah succeeded in meeting up within the 40 minute time limit, with just 15 seconds remaining. Unfortunately, although Sarah&#x27;s backpack opened, Clive had the money.

First broadcast on 1 January 1990.

==Production==
Although each episode appeared to be filmed in real time, it was not. The introduction was filmed the day before the game itself, giving the producers opportunity to re-randomise the backpacks the contestants had chosen. The 40-minute game time was also somewhat elastic, with filming and gameplay often suspended.

Two helicopters were used in the production of the series supplied, as in Treasure Hunt by Cornwall-based company Castle Air. One of these was the Interceptor&#x27;s aircraft, the black and yellow Agusta A109, with the registration G-MEAN. The other was G-BHXU, the same Agusta-Bell Jetranger helicopter used in &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, piloted here by Jerry Grayson.

The theme music, composed by Chatsworth&#x27;s resident composer Zack Laurence, is an adaptation of Chopin&#x27;s Etude in C minor, Opus 10 Number 12 titled &quot;Rock Revolution&quot;. It was released as a single with an &#x27;instrumental&#x27; B-side (essentially the track minus the piano) titled &quot;Interceptor Boogie&quot;.

==Attempted U.S. version==
The series was first tried as a possible American entry in 1989, with a pilot produced by Fries Entertainment airing in syndication during April of that year. Hosted by actor Erik Estrada, along with celebrity guests Barbi Benton and Bruce Boxleitner, it was not picked up as a series.

<doc id="947131" wikidata="Q165061" url="?curid=947131" title="Giverny">
<text>Giverny () is a commune in the northern French department of Eure. The village is located on the &quot;right bank&quot; of the river Seine at its confluence with the river Epte. It lies west-northwest of Paris, in the region of Normandy. It is best known as the location of Claude Monet&#x27;s garden and home.

Several American Impressionist artists also settled in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. Other attractions include the Museum of Impressionism Giverny, dedicated to the history of impressionism and the Giverny art colony, and the Hôtel Baudy, which was the center of artistic life in Giverny&#x27;s heyday. It is now a café and restaurant, with period decoration.

==History==

A settlement has existed in Giverny since neolithic times and a monument uncovered attests to this fact. Archeological finds have included bootees dating from Gallo-Roman times and to the earlier 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The town was known in ancient deeds as &quot;Warnacum&quot;. The cultivation of grapes has been an occupation of the inhabitants of Giverny since Merovingian times.

The village church dates from the Middle Ages and is built partially in the Romanesque style, though additions have since been made. It is dedicated to Sainte-Radegonde. The village has remained a small rural setting with a modest population (numbering around 301 in 1883 when Monet discovered it) and has since seen a boom in tourism since the restoration of Monet&#x27;s house and gardens.



==Monet at Giverny==
Claude Monet noticed the village of Giverny while looking out of a train window. He made up his mind to move there and rented a house and the area surrounding it. In 1890 he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint.

Some of his most famous paintings were of his garden in Giverny, famous for its rectangular &quot;Clos Normand&quot;, with archways of climbing plants entwined around colored shrubs, and the water garden, formed by a tributary to the Epte, with the Japanese bridge, the pond with the water lilies, the wisterias and the azaleas.

== The Giverny Colony ==

Beginning around 1887, several American Impressionist artists settled to work in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. These included Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritman, Lydia Field Emmet, Theodore Wendel, and John Leslie Breck. Soon many American extended their visits from summer through the entire year. American painter Theodore Earl Butler married Monet&#x27;s stepdaughter and sometime-model Suzanne Hoschedé there in 1892.

Frederick Carl Frieseke spent every summer from 1906 through 1919 in a residence next door to Monet&#x27;s. The term Decorative Impressionism was coined in 1911 to describe Frieseke&#x27;s work, and the term describes the work of a &quot;second wave&quot; of American painters in Giverny such as Richard E. Miller. In December 1910, six of the Giverny artists (Frieseke, Miller, Lawton S. Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson) were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them &quot;The Giverny Group.&quot;

The First World War largely marked the end of the art colony.

==Attractions==

Claude Monet&#x27;s property at Giverny (house and gardens), left by his son to the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1966, became a Museum opened to public visit in 1980 after completion of large-scale restoration work: the huge Nymphea&#x27;s studio was restored and the precious collection of Japanese woodblock prints was displayed in several rooms, hung in the manner chosen by the master himself; the gardens were replanted as they once were. The house became a popular tourist attraction (the Claude Monet Foundation), particularly in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.

The other main attraction of the village is the Museum of Impressionism Giverny, dedicated to the history of impressionism and its continuation in the Giverny art colony and along the valley of the River Seine.

The Hôtel Baudy was a center of artistic life in the Giverny heyday. It is now still a café and restaurant, with period decoration.

Giverny is also located 9.0 km from the Middle Age castle of La Roche-Guyon and the Seine River Bank.

<doc id="947136" wikidata="Q3302817" url="?curid=947136" title="Roman abacus">
<text>The Ancient Romans developed the Roman hand [[abacus]], a portable, but less capable, base-10 version of earlier abacuses like those that were used by the Greeks and Babylonians.

==Origin==
The Roman abacus was the first portable calculating device for engineers, merchants, and presumably tax collectors. It greatly reduced the time needed to perform the basic operations of arithmetic using Roman numerals.

Karl Menninger said: 
For more extensive and complicated calculations, such as those involved in Roman land surveys, there was, in addition to the hand abacus, a true reckoning board with unattached counters or pebbles. The Etruscan cameo and the Greek predecessors, such as the Salamis Tablet and the Darius Vase, give us a good idea of what it must have been like, although no actual specimens of the true Roman counting board are known to be extant. But language, the most reliable and conservative guardian of a past culture, has come to our rescue once more. Above all, it has preserved the fact of the &quot;unattached&quot; counters so faithfully that we can discern this more clearly than if we possessed an actual counting board. What the Greeks called &quot;psephoi&quot;, the Romans called &quot;calculi&quot;. The Latin word &quot;calx&quot; means &#x27;pebble&#x27; or &#x27;gravel stone&#x27;; &quot;calculi&quot; are thus little stones (used as counters).

Both the Roman abacus and the Chinese suanpan have been used since ancient times. With one bead above and four below the bar, the systematic configuration of the Roman abacus is comparable to the modern Japanese soroban, although the soroban was historically derived from the suanpan.

==Layout==

The Late Roman hand abacus shown here as a reconstruction contains seven longer and seven shorter grooves used for whole number counting, the former having up to four beads in each, and the latter having just one. The rightmost two grooves were for fractional counting. The abacus was made of a metal plate where the beads ran in slots. The size was such that it could fit in a modern shirt pocket.

The lower groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the upper shorter grooves denote fives (five units, five tens, &quot;etc.),&quot; resembling a bi-quinary coded decimal place value system.

Computations are made by means of beads which it is believed would have been slid up and down the grooves to indicate the value of each column.

The upper slots contained a single bead, while the lower slots contained four beads, the only exceptions being the two rightmost columns, column 2 marked Ө and column 1 with three symbols down the side of a single slot or beside three separate slots with Ɛ, 3 or S or a symbol like the £ sign but without the horizontal bar beside the top slot, a backwards C beside the middle slot and a 2 symbol beside the bottom slot, depending on the example abacus and the source which could be Friedlein, Menninger or Ifrah. These latter two slots are for mixed-base math, a development unique to the Roman hand abacus described in following sections.

The longer slot with five beads below the Ө position allowed for the counting of 1/12 of a whole unit called an &quot;uncia&quot; (from which the English words &quot;inch&quot; and &quot;ounce&quot; are derived), making the abacus useful for Roman measures and Roman currency. The first column was either a single slot with 4 beads or 3 slots with one, one and two beads respectively top to bottom. In either case, three symbols were included beside the single slot version or one symbol per slot for the three slot version. Many measures were aggregated by twelfths. Thus the Roman pound (&#x27;libra&#x27;), consisted of 12 ounces (&quot;unciae&quot;) (1 uncia = 28 grams). A measure of volume, &quot;congius&quot;, consisted of 12 heminae (1 hemina = 0.273 litres). The Roman foot (&quot;pes&quot;), was 12 inches (&quot;unciae&quot;) (1 uncia = 2.43 cm). The &quot;actus&quot;, the standard furrow length when plowing, was 120 &quot;pedes&quot;. There were however other measures in common use - for example the &quot;sextarius&quot; was two &quot;heminae&quot;.

The &quot;as&quot;, the principal copper coin in Roman currency, was also divided into 12 unciae. Again, the abacus was ideally suited for counting currency.

== Symbols and usage ==
The first column was arranged either as a single slot with three different symbols or as three separate slots with one, one and two beads or counters respectively and a distinct symbol for each slot. It is most likely that the rightmost slot or slots were used to enumerate fractions of an &quot;uncia&quot; and these were, from top to bottom, 1/2 s, 1/4 s and 1/12 s of an &quot;uncia&quot;. The upper character in this slot (or the top slot where the rightmost column is three separate slots) is the character most closely resembling that used to denote a &quot;semuncia&quot; or 1/24. The name &quot;semuncia&quot; denotes 1/2 of an &quot;uncia&quot; or 1/24 of the base unit, the &quot;As&quot;. Likewise, the next character is that used to indicate a &quot;sicilicus&quot; or 1/48 of an &quot;As&quot;, which is 1/4 of an &quot;uncia&quot;. These two characters are to be found in the table of Roman fractions on page 75 of Graham Flegg&#x27;s book. Finally, the last or lower character is most similar but not identical to the character in Flegg&#x27;s table to denote 1/144 of an &quot;As&quot;, the &quot;dimidio sextula&quot;, which is the same as 1/12 of an &quot;uncia&quot;.

This is however even more strongly supported by Gottfried Friedlein in the table at the end of the book which summarizes the use of a very extensive set of alternative formats for different values including that of fractions. In the entry in this table numbered 14 referring back to (Zu) 48, he lists different symbols for the &quot;semuncia&quot; (1/24), the &quot;sicilicus&quot; (1/48), the &quot;sextula&quot; (1/72), the &quot;dimidia sextula&quot; (1/144), and the &quot;scriptulum&quot; (1/288). Of prime importance, he specifically notes the formats of the &quot;semuncia&quot;, &quot;sicilicus&quot; and &quot;sextula&quot; as used on the Roman bronze abacus, &quot;auf dem chernan abacus&quot;. The &quot;semuncia&quot; is the symbol resembling a capital &quot;S&quot;, but he also includes the symbol that resembles a numeral three with horizontal line at the top, the whole rotated 180 degrees. It is these two symbols that appear on samples of abacus in different museums. The symbol for the &quot;sicilicus&quot; is that found on the abacus and resembles a large right single quotation mark spanning the entire line height.

The most important symbol is that for the &quot;sextula&quot;, which resembles very closely a cursive digit 2. Now, as stated by Friedlein, this symbol indicates the value of 1/72 of an &quot;As&quot;. However, he stated specifically in the penultimate sentence of section 32 on page 23, the two beads in the bottom slot each have a value of 1/72. This would allow this slot to represent only 1/72 (i.e. 1/6 × 1/12 with one bead) or 1/36 (i.e. 2/6 × 1/12 = 1/3 × 1/12 with two beads) of an &quot;uncia&quot; respectively. This contradicts all existing documents that state this lower slot was used to count thirds of an &quot;uncia&quot; (i.e. 1/3 and 2/3 × 1/12 of an &quot;As&quot;.

This results in two opposing interpretations of this slot, that of Friedlein and that of many other experts such as Ifrah, and Menninger who propose the one and two thirds usage.

There is however a third possibility.

If this symbol refers to the total value of the slot (i.e. 1/72 of an as), then each of the two counters can only have a value of half this or 1/144 of an as or 1/12 of an uncia. This then suggests that these two counters did in fact count twelfths of an uncia and not thirds of an uncia. Likewise, for the top and upper middle, the symbols for the semuncia and sicilicus could also indicate the value of the slot itself and since there is only one bead in each, would be the value of the bead also. This would allow the symbols for all three of these slots to represent the slot value without involving any contradictions.

A further argument which suggests the lower slot represents twelfths rather than thirds of an uncia is best described by the figure above. The diagram above assumes for ease that one is using fractions of an uncia as a unit value equal to one. If the beads in the lower slot of column I represent thirds, then the beads in the three slots for fractions of 1/12 of an uncia cannot show all values from 1/12 of an uncia to 11/12 of an uncia. In particular, it would not be possible to represent 1/12, 2/12 and 5/12. Furthermore, this arrangement would allow for seemingly unnecessary values of 13/12, 14/12 and 17/12. Even more significant, it is logically impossible for there to be a rational progression of arrangements of the beads in step with unit increasing values of twelfths. Likewise, if each of the beads in the lower slot is assumed to have a value of 1/6 of an uncia, there is again an irregular series of values available to the user, no possible value of 1/12 and an extraneous value of 13/12. It is only by employing a value of 1/12 for each of the beads in the lower slot that all values of twelfths from 1/12 to 11/12 can be represented and in a logical ternary, binary, binary progression for the slots from bottom to top. This can be best appreciated by reference to the figure below.
Alternative usages of the beads in the lower slot

It can be argued that the beads in this first column could have been used as originally believed and widely stated, i.e. as ½, ¼ and ⅓ and ⅔, completely independently of each other. However this is more difficult to support in the case where this first column is a single slot with the three inscribed symbols. To complete the known possibilities, in one example found by this author, the first and second columns were transposed. It would not be unremarkable if the makers of these instruments produced output with minor differences, since the vast number of variations in modern calculators provide a compelling example.

What can be deduced from these Roman abacuses, is the undeniable proof that Romans were using a device that exhibited a decimal, place-value system, and the inferred knowledge of a zero value as represented by a column with no beads in a counted position. Furthermore, the biquinary-like nature of the integer portion allowed for direct transcription from and to the written Roman numerals. No matter what the true usage was, what cannot be denied by the very format of the abacus is that if not yet proven, these instruments provide very strong arguments in favour of far greater facility with practical mathematics known and practised by the Romans in this authors view.

The reconstruction of a Roman hand abacus in the Cabinet, supports this. The replica Roman hand abacus at, shown alone here, plus the description of a Roman abacus on page 23 of &quot;Die Zahlzeichen und das elementare Rechnen der Griechen und Römer und des christlichen&quot; provides further evidence of such devices.

<text>Hungarton (or Hungerton) is a small village and civil parish in the Harborough district of Leicestershire, England, about north-east of Leicester and south-west of Melton Mowbray. The population of the civil parish was 269 at the 2001 census, including Ingarsby, and increased to 289 at the 2011 census.

==Amenities==
The village has a church, a village hall, a small stream and a Millennium Green. It also has a pub called &quot;The Black Boy&quot;. Stilton cheese was first produced in a dairy in the grounds of Quenby Hall.

The Anglican Church of St John the Baptist is part of a group benefice with Keyham, Billesdon, Goadby and Skeffington. A service is held twice a month.

==Heritage==
The village features in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Hungretone&quot;.

The parish of Hungarton covers over and includes with the village the estates of Quenby Hall, Baggrave and Ingarsby.

A bill to enclose common lands in the village was introduced in 1762.

The village layout follows the model village built in 1764–1776 by Shukburgh Ashby, then owner of nearby Quenby Hall. There are a few cottages that pre-date this and several houses built since.

John Marius Wilson: &quot;Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales&quot; (1870–72):

<doc id="947144" wikidata="Q587725" url="?curid=947144" title="Sarah Jane Smith">
<text>Sarah Jane Smith is a fictional character played by Elisabeth Sladen in the long-running BBC Television science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and two of its spin-offs. Sarah Jane is a dogged investigative journalist who first encounters alien time traveller the Doctor while trying to break a story on a top secret research facility, and subsequently becomes his travelling companion on a series of adventures spanning the breadth of space and time. After travelling with The Doctor in four seasons of the show they suddenly part ways, and after this she continues to investigate strange goings-on back on Earth. Over time, Sarah Jane establishes herself as a committed defender of Earth from alien invasions and other threats, occasionally reuniting with The Doctor in the course of her own adventures, all the while continuing to work as a freelance investigative journalist.

Sarah Jane is one of the Doctor&#x27;s longest-serving companions, co-starring in 18 stories (80 episodes) with the third and fourth incarnations of the Doctor, on the programme from 1973 to 1976 (seasons 11 – 14). She and robotic dog K9 appear in the 1981 television pilot &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;. She returned in the 20th-anniversary Fifth Doctor story &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983) and the 30th-anniversary story &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; (1993), then co-starred in two BBC radio serials with the Third Doctor (&quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; and &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot;), and starred in a series of spin-off audio dramas entitled &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; for independent production company Big Finish. After the television revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, she appears in several episodes with the Tenth Doctor, and as the central character of her own series &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; from 2007 to 2011, which included appearances by both the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors.

In April 2020, former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner Russell T Davies released an epilogue to Sarah Jane&#x27;s story on the anniversary of Sladen&#x27;s death, detailing various characters attending Sarah&#x27;s funeral.

==Casting==
&quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer Barry Letts offered the part of Sarah Jane to actress April Walker, who accepted the role and was duly contracted by the BBC. During rehearsals for &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, it became clear to Jon Pertwee and Letts that the two leads had little rapport and were physically mis-matched (it has been claimed that Pertwee demanded the part be recast, because Walker was too tall for the role). Letts therefore released Walker from her contract (though she was still paid in full for season 11). Although committed to not talking about the issue in her release agreement, Walker began to discuss the circumstances surrounding her casting decades later. After giving some written interviews to fanzines, in May 2020 Walker gave an on screen interview to &#x27;Time Space Visualiser&#x27; giving much further detail about the circumstances, including revealing later work alongside Pertwee. Walker admitted that although she understood Pertwee&#x27;s thinking, she told him she would never forgive him for what he had done. Letts began a second batch of auditions and saw Elisabeth Sladen after a recommendation from fellow BBC producer Bill Slater, who had twice cast the actress recently in separate episodes of &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. Sladen performed her audition alongside actor Stephen Thorne and after impressing Letts, he arranged for her to meet Pertwee before any decisions were made. Pertwee stood behind Sladen and gave a &#x27;thumbs-up&#x27; to Letts who then offered her the role.

==Appearances==
===Television===
====1973–1976, 1981, 1983; introduction and classic run====

Sarah Jane first appears in the Third Doctor serial &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1973–74), where she has managed to infiltrate a top secret research facility by posing as her aunt, Lavinia Smith, a famous virologist. Introduced as an ardent feminist, Sarah Jane sneaks aboard the TARDIS and becomes embroiled in a battle against a militaristic alien Sontaran in the Middle Ages who is kidnapping scientists from the present day. Subsequently, she accompanies The Doctor (Jon Pertwee) on several journeys in the TARDIS, and she also assists the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce led by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) on a number of occasions. After Pertwee&#x27;s departure, Sladen remains following Season 11 finale &quot;Planet of the Spiders&quot; (1974), in which The Doctor regenerates for the third time. In season 12&#x27;s consecutive 1975 serials &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;, &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, Sarah and male companion Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) face the series&#x27; three iconic recurring creatures, the Sontarans, the Daleks and the Cybermen. In &quot;Genesis&quot; Sarah is present at the creation of the Daleks and meets their creator, Davros (Michael Wisher). Sarah Jane departs in the Season 14 serial &quot;The Hand of Fear&quot; (1976) after The Doctor receives a summons to his home planet, Gallifrey. Sladen has described Sarah as &quot;a bit of a cardboard cut-out. Each week it used to be, &#x27;Yes Doctor, no Doctor&#x27;...&quot;

Following her tenure as a companion, Sladen reprised the role of Sarah Jane in a pilot episode for an Earth-based spin-off series, &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, in 1981. In the pilot episode, titled &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, Sarah Jane receives the robot dog K9 Mark III (John Leeson) as a Christmas present from The Doctor. The pilot did not lead to a series, but the character reappeared in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for the 1983 twentieth anniversary story &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, in which she is transported to Gallifrey by Lord President Borusa (Philip Latham) to take part in the Game of Rassilon in The Death Zone devised by Time Lord founder Rassilon (Richard Mathews). Here, Sarah is reunited with the Third Doctor, and also meets the First, Second and Fifth. &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; shows that Sarah Jane still owns and is working with K9. The character made an appearance in the 1993 &quot;Children in Need&quot; special (a crossover with long-running British soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;), &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, wherein various Doctors and companions are teleported to Albert Square as part of a plot by the Rani (Kate O&#x27;Mara). Though Sladen would not make any more official &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television appearances until 2006, in the interval the actress reprised her role as Sarah Jane twice on BBC radio with Jon Pertwee, and in a series of &quot;Big Finish&quot; audio dramas, and in the unofficial direct-to-video spin-off film &quot;Downtime&quot; (1995) alongside the Brigadier, Second Doctor companion Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) and Leeson in a rare on-screen role.

====2006–2011, 2020, 2023, 2024; revived series and spin-off====
Following Russell T Davies&#x27; 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; revival, Sladen returned to the show in the Series 2 episode &quot;School Reunion&quot; (2006). &quot;School Reunion&quot; revisits Sarah Jane, still working alongside K9 since &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;, when she encounters the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) while they both investigate mysterious goings on at a school run by Headmaster Finch (Anthony Head). Exposition in the episode reveals that, having waited years for The Doctor to return to her, Sarah Jane assumed he had died, though later came to suspect his involvement when witnessing the alien spaceship above London in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. On meeting Sarah Jane, current companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) reflects on her future after The Doctor. Though K9 Mark III still assists Sarah Jane, he has fallen into disrepair; after K9 Mark III sacrifices himself to save Sarah Jane and The Doctor, The Doctor leaves Sarah Jane a new K9 model, K9 Mark IV, and takes her advice by inviting Rose&#x27;s boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) aboard the TARDIS as his second companion. The success of &quot;School Reunion&quot; led to the development of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, starring Sladen as Sarah Jane, produced by BBC Wales for CBBC.

In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, Sarah Jane investigates alien activity covertly from her manor house in Bannerman Road in Ealing, driving an emerald green Nissan Figaro and with the help of her sentient supercomputer Mr Smith (voice of comedian Alexander Armstrong), as well as an alien activity scanner and sonic lipstick device. In the special premiere episode &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot; (2007), Sarah Jane adopts a son: Bane creation, genetic archetype and boy genius Luke Smith (Tommy Knight), and befriends her neighbour Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige) during her investigation of Bane leader Mrs Wormwood (Samantha Bond). Sarah Jane remarks that since meeting them she is no longer content to live alone; she discloses she never married after parting from the Fourth Doctor, to whom no one could ever compare. Sometime between &quot;School Reunion&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot;, K9 has left Sarah Jane to close off a black hole, occasionally passing close enough to contact her; due to the concurrent development of the &quot;K-9&quot; television series, to which creator Bob Baker owns the rights, K9 only appears in two episodes of the first series. In the first series, Sarah Jane learns how to be a mother to Luke, the while strengthening her friendship with teenage neighbour Maria, the person Sarah Jane &quot;trusts the most&quot;. Along with Luke and his friend Clyde Langer (Daniel Anthony) they defeat and repel various threats to the contemporary Earth. Amongst these threats, series one introduces The Trickster (Paul Marc Davis), a cosmic being who makes alterations to the timeline to cause chaos and destruction; he becomes a recurring adversary for Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane finds a new enemy in the Slitheen, a family of criminal aliens originally seen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, and an ally in alien research scientist Professor Rivers (Floella Benjamin). Time travel scenes also depict 13-year-old Sarah Jane (Jessica Ashworth), for whom the death of her best friend Andrea Yates (Jane Asher) gave Sarah Jane her resolve to fight against loss of life.

Sarah Jane then reappears in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in the two-part fourth series finale episodes &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; and &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), which crosses over from &quot;Torchwood&quot; and &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. When Daleks invade Earth, Sarah Jane is summoned along with UNIT officer Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) and Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) by former PM Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) to help The Doctor save the universe. On the Dalek ship Davros (Julian Bleach) recognises Sarah Jane from their encounter in the classic series&#x27; episode &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. In &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; second series (2008), Maria moves away to America in &quot;The Last Sontaran&quot;, and Sarah Jane befriends new neighbour Rani Chandra (Anjli Mohindra) in &quot;The Day of the Clown&quot;; the same episode features flashbacks to Sarah Jane&#x27;s (Jessica Mogridge) childhood in her Aunt Lavinia&#x27;s home. In &quot;The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith&quot;, Sarah Jane saves the lives of her parents, Eddie (Christopher Pizzey) and Barbara (Rosanna Lavelle) in 1951; by doing so she plays into The Trickster&#x27;s hands, creating a post-apocalyptic alternative universe in the present day. Learning of this however, her parents choose to die, becoming heroes to restore the timeline. In series two finale &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot;, Sarah Jane&#x27;s old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) from UNIT assists her against united adversaries Mrs Wormwood and Sontaran Commander Kaagh (Anthony O&#x27;Donnell). Sarah Jane feels threatened on a personal level by Mrs Wormwood&#x27;s claim to be Luke&#x27;s mother as his creator. Sladen has relatively scarce screen-time in &quot;Sarah Jane-lite&quot; serial &quot;The Mark of the Berserker&quot; due to back-to-back filming. Though K9 makes no appearances in series two, he appears to assist Sarah Jane against Ambassador Ranius (Ronnie Corbett) in a mini-episode for &quot;Comic Relief&quot; (2009).

In series three (2009), Sarah Jane makes a new enemy in the body-stealing alien Androvax (Mark Goldthorp) as well as a lukewarm ally in the form of the interplanetary police force, the Judoon (from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;). In the second two-parter, Sarah Jane is able to recover K9 full-time (reflecting a real-world deal struck with the creators of the children&#x27;s series &quot;K-9&quot;). In a crossover with the parent show, Sarah Jane reveals her intention to marry her secret fiancé, barrister Peter Dalton, in &quot;The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith&quot;. However, Dalton&#x27;s involvement in Sarah Jane&#x27;s life proves to be a scheme of The Trickster. The Doctor gatecrashes the wedding to foil The Trickster&#x27;s plot to make Sarah Jane give up on alien hunting, and explains to Sarah Jane that The Trickster is a powerful member of the extra-dimensional so-called Pantheon of Discord. The serial clarifies that Sarah Jane owes her independent wealth to her Aunt Lavina&#x27;s will. In &#x27;Sarah-lite&#x27; two-parter &quot;Mona Lisa&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, Sarah Jane and Luke have their first argument as he progresses into his teenage years; they argue about the cleanliness of Luke&#x27;s room. In series finale &quot;The Gift&quot;, though she is reluctant to use weapons or cause harm, when Luke falls deathly ill for the first time ever due to the machinations of the Blathereen-Slitheen, Sarah Jane takes up arms to confront them. In the episode&#x27;s conclusion, regretfully she is forced to kill them using Mr Smith.

Sarah Jane next appears in the Tenth Doctor two-part &quot;Doctor Who&quot; finale, &quot;The End of Time&quot;, in 2010. When The Doctor is slowly dying from radiation poisoning, he makes timely visits to his close friends and companions; The Doctor saves Luke&#x27;s life from an oncoming car on Bannerman Road (an inside joke by Russell T Davies commenting on actors&#x27; failure to look for cars before crossing the street because traffic is always stopped for them, something that he believes is especially important in a children’s show) and bids a silent farewell to Luke and to Sarah Jane.

In the fourth season (2010) of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, Sarah Jane sees Luke off to university in the first two-parter of the series, but continues her adventures alongside Rani and Clyde. The trio encounter the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), as well as Sarah Jane&#x27;s immediate predecessor as The Doctor&#x27;s companion, Jo Grant (Katy Manning), in &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;; aliens known as the Shansheeth fake The Doctor&#x27;s death as part of a plot to gain access to the TARDIS using Jo and Sarah Jane&#x27;s memories. &quot;The Empty Planet&quot; is this series&#x27; &#x27;Sarah-lite&#x27; serial; with the rest of the population, Sarah Jane mysteriously vanishes, leaving Rani and Clyde to investigate without her. In &quot;Lost in Time&quot;, Sarah Jane is sent back in time on a mission from the mysterious Shopkeeper (Cyril Nri). Sarah Jane is convinced to retire by an alien plot in the series finale, earning a new nemesis and doppelgänger in Ruby White (Julie Graham); she is saved from Ruby when Luke drives down from university to her rescue.

Sladen&#x27;s death ended the show in the middle of its fifth series, which aired in 2011. In its premiere story, Sarah Jane adopts a new child in the form of Sky Smith (Sinead Michael), a genetically-engineered alien girl with abilities relating to electromagnetism; the Shopkeeper arranged for their encounter, but declines to explain his motives to Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane&#x27;s final broadcast appearance comes in series five finale &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;. The final story ends with a short montage of archive footage and audio recordings celebrating Sarah Jane&#x27;s journey from lone investigator to mother of two surrounded by friends. The series ends with the final caption: &quot;And the story goes on... forever.&quot;

The cast and writers of &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; produced a special 2020 webcast epilogue for the show with a mix of narrated and acted elements entitled &quot;Farewell, Sarah Jane&quot;. In the story, Sarah Jane&#x27;s friends and many past companions of the Doctor return to London to attend her funeral. At the end of the webcast, Rani and Mr Smith speculate whether Sarah Jane actually did not die and instead went to travel the universe with the Doctor once more.

In the 60th Anniversary special, &quot;The Giggle&quot;, it is confirmed that Sarah Jane has died. In the episode, the newly bi-generated Fifteenth Doctor reminisces with the Fourteenth Doctor about all the loss that they have suffered up to that point in their lives. Amongst the names and events mentioned, the Fifteenth Doctor mentions that Sarah Jane is gone and both Doctors express their love for her.

In the &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot; spin-off episode &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;, the Fifteenth Doctor tells his companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) about Sarah Jane and that they were best friends and told her that she travelled with him during his first encounter with Sutekh. It is later revealed that the conversation took place during the events of &quot;Empire of Death&quot;.

===Literature===
Sarah Jane appears in several &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels and short stories, notably in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; by Lawrence Miles; and the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Bullet Time&quot; by David A. McIntee, all taking place after she stops travelling with The Doctor. She appears in Ian Marter&#x27;s &quot;Harry Sullivan&#x27;s War&quot; published by Target Books; Marter played companion Harry Sullivan in seven television serials. Different accounts of Sarah Jane&#x27;s life have been given in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; literature. &quot;Interference&quot; and the Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Christmas on a Rational Planet&quot;, also by Miles, suggest that Sarah Jane married someone named Paul Morley sometime between 1996 and 1998 and took his name. In the short story &quot;Lily&quot; by Jackie Marshall, in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury&quot;, the Fifth Doctor pays a visit to an older Sarah Jane, who has a daughter, Lauren, and an autistic granddaughter, Lily; Lauren&#x27;s father is named Will. In the Past Doctor Adventure &quot;Bullet Time&quot;, Sarah Jane is apparently killed—although the story is ambiguous about whether she actually dies—in 1997 when she sacrifices herself so that she cannot be used as a hostage to stop the Seventh Doctor from taking action to aid an escaping alien ship, contradicting her other spin-off appearances. However, the novel takes place during a story arc where enemies of The Doctor were attempting to eliminate his companions from the Timeline (revealed in the later novel &quot;Sometime Never...&quot;), and Sarah Jane&#x27;s death may have been reversed when those enemies are defeated. In any case, other stories have shown her alive after 1997. Sarah Jane was mentioned in the prologue of the Virgin Publishing novelisation of &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; by John Peel. It revealed that Sarah Jane was working as UNIT&#x27;s official chronicler and that in &quot;1996&quot; she covered the aftermath of the Cybermen&#x27;s failed attempt to drain Earth of its energy and the technology left behind in their wake (&quot;The Tenth Planet&quot;, which was actually set in 1986).

Stories written as in-universe articles in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special&quot; 1991 (subtitled &quot;UNIT Exposed&quot;), made statements about Sarah Jane&#x27;s life after leaving the Fourth Doctor. She wrote a history of UNIT, &quot;Fighting for Humankind&quot; (&quot;heavily vetted and evidently subjected to considerable censorship&quot;), as well as a series of science fiction novels. These featured an extraterrestrial called The Doctor and his companion Nicola Jones, who frequently encountered WIN (World Investigative Network), commanded by General Lutwidge-Douglas. Titles included &quot;Day of the Dinosaurs&quot;, &quot;Sutekh the Destroyer&quot; and &quot;The North Sea Monster&quot;.

Another in-universe article was written by Kevin W. Parker, Roving Reporter, which was a biography of Sarah Jane from her childhood to the early 1990s. She grew up with her aunt Lavinia after her parents died in a car crash. She went to Caterham School For Girls and the University of Nottingham. She was engaged to Andrew Lofts, an aspiring television journalist; it didn&#x27;t last. She ended up working with UNIT; her exact duties were never described. In the spring of 1981, she left UNIT after being hospitalized from an accident in a quarry. Afterwards she developed a romantic relationship with Harry Sullivan; they parted amicably and were still very fond of each other, and were still close friends, even to the time of the article. She wrote science fiction novels &quot;World War Skaro&quot; and &quot;The Monster at the End of Space&quot; which made it onto the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller lists.

Though there are as yet no original &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; novels, many of the television episodes have been novelised.

===Audio drama===
Between seasons 13 and 14, Sladen appeared as Sarah Jane, with Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, in the audio play &quot;The Pescatons&quot;, released on LP by The Decca Record Company Limited in 1976. She also appeared with Baker in &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, episode three of the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Exploration Earth&quot; broadcast on 4 October 1976. Also in 1976 she appeared as Sarah Jane alongside Tom Baker&#x27;s Doctor in the first ever BBC Enterprises audio spin-off from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: a cassette and LP release of an abridged version of &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, narrated by Baker. Sarah Jane (played by Sladen) appeared in two BBC Radio plays starring Jon Pertwee as The Doctor in the 1990s: &quot;The Paradise of Death&quot; and &quot;The Ghosts of N-Space&quot;.

She also appears, voiced by Sladen, in her own range of Big Finish audio dramas, consisting of nine stories released between 2002 and 2006. This series came to an unexpected end when the character was given her own television series, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, detailed above. There are loose allusions to the audio series in the television series, including Sarah Jane&#x27;s ownership of a Volkswagen.

Sarah Jane appears in two audio stories based on &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, released in November 2007 on CD: &quot;The Glittering Storm&quot; by Stephen Cole and &quot;The Thirteenth Stone&quot; by Justin Richards, with both stories read by series star Elisabeth Sladen. This is the first time that BBC Audiobooks have commissioned new content for exclusive release on audio. Further pairs of audio stories were released every year until 2010, again all read by Sladen. In 2011, two audio stories were read by Daniel Anthony and Anjii Mohindra.

Sladen&#x27;s daughter Sadie Miller took over the role of Sarah Jane Smith for Big Finish audio dramas in 2021, first in &quot;Return of the Cybermen&quot; in March, a reworking of Gerry Davis&#x27; 1974 original script which was eventually filmed as &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, with Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor; and then in &quot;The Third Doctor Adventures&quot; in May, with Tim Treloar as the third Doctor.

The canonicity of Sarah Jane&#x27;s appearances in the audio dramas is, like all &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off media, unclear, and they may not even take place in the same continuity as one another. For example, the novels&#x27; mention of Sarah Jane as having been married is contradicted by the later &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; audio play &quot;Dreamland&quot;, and the &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; episode &quot;Invasion of the Bane&quot;.

==Reception, impact and legacy==
Sarah Jane Smith was consistently voted the most popular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; companion until the advent of the new series in 2005. Even in more recent times the character has continued to vie in popularity with Rose Tyler, Donna Noble, and Ace. Sladen felt that part of her popularity was working alongside Pertwee and Baker, who were popular Doctors. Daniel Martin of &quot;The Guardian&quot; named her the best companion in 2007, writing that her &quot;jolly-hockey-sticks good nature&quot; made her so beloved. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; Gavin Fuller also ranked Sarah Jane number one, praising Sladen&#x27;s portrayal and saying that she displayed &quot;great determination and bravery&quot;.

In 2012, Toby Whithouse, who wrote Sarah Jane&#x27;s return to the series in &quot;School Reunion&quot;, said she was his favourite companion from the classic series. Concerning the impact of the character, he said:

<text>The National Bolshevik Party (NBP; ) operated from 1993 to 2007 as a Russian political party with a political program of National Bolshevism. The NBP became a prominent member of The Other Russia coalition of opposition parties. Its members are known as Nazbols ().

There have been smaller NBP groups in other countries. Its official publication, the newspaper &quot;Limonka&quot;, derived its name from the party leader&#x27;s surname and from the idiomatic Russian word for a grenade. The main editor of &quot;Limonka&quot; was for many years, Aleksey Volynets. Russian courts banned the organization and it never officially registered as a political party. In 2010, its leader Eduard Limonov founded a new political party, called The Other Russia of E. V. Limonov.

== Ideology ==

=== Party platform ===

The NBP believes in the National Bolshevik ideas that arose during the Russian Civil War, such as those from Nikolai Ustryalov, who came to believe that Bolshevism could be modified to serve nationalistic purposes. His followers, the Smenovekhovtsy, who then came to regard themselves as National Bolsheviks, borrowed the term from Ernst Niekisch, who was a German politician initially associated with left-wing politics and later the National Bolshevik ideology.

The NBP has denied any links to fascism, stating that all forms of antisemitism, xenophobia, and racism were against the party&#x27;s principles. The NBP has historically defended Stalinism, although later on the party said it did not wish to re-create that system. The party is described as a mixture of far-left and far-right ideology, including among its members Sovietism&#x27; nostalgics as well as skinheads, with the hammer and sickle (which replace the swastika) in a white circle on a red background as party&#x27;s flag.

On 29 November 2004, participants of the general congress of the NBP adopted a new party program. According to the program, &quot;the main goal of the National Bolshevik Party is to change Russia into a modern, powerful state, respected by other countries and peoples and beloved by its own citizens&quot; by ensuring the free development of civil society, the independence of the media, and social justice. The NBP was highly critical of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s government and argued that state institutions, such as the bureaucracy, the police, and the courts, were corrupt and authoritarian.

=== Counterculture ===

Since its formation, the National Bolshevik Party had relationships with Russian counterculture. National Bolsheviks often used shock aesthetics from the punk subculture in their propaganda. NBP attracted a significant number of artists, punk musicians and rock bands.

=== Criticism ===
Some Western critics commented on its heavy use of totalitarian and fascist symbols and what they called its &quot;national-patriotic demagoguery&quot;, and academics have described the group as neo-fascist. In the Russian media, the National Bolshevik Party was usually referred to as a far-left youth movement; however, some critics (including ex-members) allege that the NBP is an organisation dedicated to carry out a colour revolution in Russia.

==Party symbols==
The symbols of the National Bolshevik Party are a combination of Soviet, Nazi, and Imperial Russian symbols; the party nonetheless denied any link to fascism and Nazism.

== History ==
=== Origins (1993–1998) ===

In 1992, Eduard Limonov founded the National Bolshevik Front (NBF) as an amalgamation of six minor groups. Aleksandr Dugin was among the earliest members and was instrumental in convincing Limonov to enter politics. The party first attracted attention in 1992 when two members were arrested for possessing grenades. The incident gave the NBP publicity for a boycott campaign they were organizing against Western goods. The NBF joined forces with the National Salvation Front, which was a broad coalition of Russian communists and nationalists.

The FNS was one of the leading groups involved in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis, and Limonov participated in the clashes near the White House in Moscow on the side of the Anti-Yeltsin opposition. When others within the coalition began to speak out against the NBF, it withdrew from the alliance. On 1 May 1993, Limonov and Dugin signed a declaration of founding the NBP. On 28 November 1994, Limonov founded the newspaper &quot;Limonka&quot;, the official organ of the NBP.

In 1998, Dugin left the NBP as a result of a conflict with other members of the party. This led to the party moving further left in Russia&#x27;s political spectrum, and led to members of the party denouncing Dugin and his group as fascists. Dugin later established the Eurasia Party, that endorses a significantly more radical nationalist and socially conservative view of National Bolshevism.

=== Arrest of Eduard Limonov (2001–2003) ===
Limonov and some National Bolsheviks were jailed in April 2001 on charges of terrorism, the forced overthrow of the constitutional order, and the illegal purchase of weapons. Based on an article published in &quot;Limonka&quot; under Limonov&#x27;s byline, the government accused Limonov of planning to start an armed insurgency in Kazakhstan.

After the arrest of the leader, members of the party started activities (including direct action stunts) against Putin&#x27;s government. In 2002, members of the NBP participated in a common demonstration of far-left forces in a Moscow a demonstration called Anticapitalism-2002. National Bolsheviks clashed with riot police. In 2003, Limonov was released from Lefortovo Prison.

=== In opposition to the government (2004–2007) ===

Since 2004, the NBP has formed alliances with other opposition forces, both far-left and right-wing. In 2004, Limonov signed the declaration titled &quot;Russia without Putin.&quot; In August 2006, an anti-Limonovist faction of the NBP that was right-wing formed the National Bolshevik Front.

The NBP became a prominent member of The Other Russia coalition of opposition parties. In 2007, the NBP members took part in a Dissenters&#x27; March and other subsequent demonstrations against the government.

=== Outlawed and aftermath (2007–2010) ===
The NBP was banned by a Russian lower court in June 2005; the Russian Supreme Court overturned that ban on 16 August 2005. In November 2005, the Russian Supreme Court upheld a ban on the party on the grounds that the NBP called itself a political party without being registered as such. On 7 August 2007, the Russian Supreme Court confirmed the decision of the Moscow City Court of 19 April to ban the party as an extremist organization.

In 2009, NBP members took part in Strategy-31, a series of civic protests in support of the right to peaceful assembly. In July 2010, the National Bolsheviks founded a new political party, The Other Russia of E. V. Limonov.

== Direct actions ==
The NBP often used non-violent direct-action stunts, mostly against prominent political figures.

=== Notable direct actions ===
On 24 August 1999, the NBP occupied a tower of the Club of Military Seamen in Sevastopol on Ukraine&#x27;s Independence Day. Some of the operatives were sentenced to prison. During the Prince Charles&#x27; tour of the Baltic states in 2001, a member of the Latvian branch of the NBP hit Charles&#x27; face with a flower in an act of protest against the war in Afghanistan. During the 2002 Prague summit, National Bolsheviks threw tomatoes at George Robertson to protest against the extension of NATO and American imperialism.

On 3 March 2004, National Bolsheviks occupied the United Russia headquarters in Moscow and protested against government policy. On 22 June 2004, National Bolsheviks occupied Germany&#x27;s Trade Embassy in Moscow on the anniversary of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. They hung a banner with an inscription &quot;Never forget! Never forgive!&quot; On 2 August 2004, a group of National Bolsheviks occupied the office of the Health and Social Development Ministry building in Moscow to protest against the social benefits reform. Police arrested most of the participants, and on 12 December 2004, seven National Bolsheviks were each sentenced to five years in prison. On 14 December 2004, NBP members occupied the presidential-administration visitors&#x27; room to protest against government policy. Police arrested thirty-nine National Bolsheviks, with many of them being sentenced to prison.

On 25 September 2006, National Bolsheviks occupied the Ministries of Finances building in Moscow to protest against liberal economic policy.

== International groups ==
The National Bolshevik Party founded branches across the post-Soviet states. Relatively strong branches of the party existed in Latvia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Several small groups often made up of Russian immigrants that are named National Bolshevik Party have existed in countries across Europe and North America. Most of them did not have official registration.

=== Latvia ===
Latvia&#x27;s NBP has had members hold office in Riga, and has executed notable publicity stunts, but it remains largely marginal there. The Latvian branch has been led by Vladimir Linderman and Aijo Beness. In 2003, Linderman was accused of storing explosives and of calling for the overthrow of the political system. He left Latvia and moved to Russia. In 2005, during the visit of George W. Bush in Latvia, local national Bolsheviks and the Vanguard of Red Youth organized meetings &quot;against American imperialism&quot;. Police broke up a demonstration and arrested its participants. The Latvian NBP was also active in anti-capitalist demonstrations and in anti-Nazi blockades during Remembrance Day of the Latvian Legionnaires.

=== Ukraine ===
Largely based in Eastern Ukraine, the NBP initially joined forces with another small parties and signed a &quot;Declaration of the Kiev Council of Slav Radical Nationalists&quot; together with Ukrainian nationalists. Later, Ukrainian national Bolsheviks were active in demonstrations against Ukrainian nationalists on the anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. National Bolsheviks also organized actions against the rapprochement of Ukraine–NATO relations. During the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainian NBP decided to not support any side. National Bolsheviks also formed armed troop interbrigades and participated in the war in Donbas.

==European Court of Human Rights decision==
In September 2021, the European Court of Human Rights found that there was a violation of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights on account of the dissolution of the NBP association in 2004 and on account of the refusal to register the NBP political party, and awarded €10,000 jointly to the children of Limonov and four of his followers.

<doc id="947147" wikidata="Q3642698" url="?curid=947147" title="The Purpose Driven Life">
<text>The Purpose Driven Life is a bible study book written by Christian pastor Rick Warren and published by Zondervan in 2002. The book offers readers a 40-day personal spiritual journey and presents what Warren says are God&#x27;s five purposes for human life on Earth.

==Background==
Warren was encouraged by Billy Graham in his 20s after he wrote his first book: &quot;Rick Warren’s Bible Study Methods&quot;. This greatly inspired Warren when he had &quot;little confidence&quot; in his writing ability:
The 2002 book &quot;Purpose Driven Life&quot; is a sequel to his 1995 book &quot;The Purpose Driven Church&quot;.

==Summary==
The book is intended to be read as a daily inspiration, with each of the 40 short chapters read on consecutive days. Each chapter contains a personal application section at the end with a &quot;point to ponder,&quot; a verse to remember, and a question to consider over the course of that day. Rick Warren described his book as an &quot;anti-self-help book.&quot; The first sentence of the book reads, &quot;It&#x27;s not about you,&quot; and the remainder of the chapter goes on to explain how the quest for personal fulfillment, satisfaction, and meaning can only be found in understanding and doing what God placed you on Earth to do. The book&#x27;s 40 chapters are divided into six major sections, with the following titles:
*What on Earth Am I Here For?
*Purpose #1: You Were Planned for God&#x27;s Pleasure (Christian Worship)
*Purpose #2: You Were Formed for God&#x27;s Family (Christian Fellowship)
*Purpose #3: You Were Created to Become Like Christ (Discipleship)
*Purpose #4: You Were Shaped for Serving God (Christian Ministry)
*Purpose #5: You Were Made for a Mission (Christian Mission)
In later versions of the book, two additional chapters were added about the two biggest reasons why Christians do not live purpose driven lives: envy and &quot;people pleasing.&quot;

== Reception ==

===Sales===

The book topped the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; best seller charts as well as &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; charts. &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; was also on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List for over 90 weeks. It had sold over 18 million copies by 2008, and 32 million copies within its first decade, by 2012. According to both the author and publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, 50 million copies had been sold in more than 85 languages by 2020.

===Impact===

A May 2005 survey of American pastors and ministers conducted by George Barna asked Christian leaders to identify what books were the most influential on their lives and ministries. &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; was the most frequent response. &quot;The Purpose Driven Church&quot;, written prior to &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot;, was the second most frequent response. Billy Graham described the book as one that would &quot;guide you to greatness—through living the Great Commandment and the Great Commission of Jesus.&quot;

In 2005, after reading the book, the President of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, invited Warren to develop the P.E.A.C.E. Plan in the country. 

===Criticism===

Biblical scholar Robert M. Price criticized Warren for applying eisegesis, which includes quoting various translations of the Bible and selectively choosing whichever paraphrase or translation supports his theses. Jason Harris criticized the book for providing the scripture citations only in end notes, making it harder for readers to know the context of the passages it cites.

===In popular culture===
In 2009, singer Carrie Underwood was inspired by the book to write the song &quot;Temporary Home&quot;. 

Filipino singer Jamie Rivera was also inspired by the book to release a studio album bearing the book&#x27;s name. The album became a hit in the Philippines, receiving gold and platinum awards. 

NFL legend Ray Lewis gave the book to 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps when he went to rehab. Phelps was deeply touched by the book. He read it while in rehab, even to other patients, earning him the nickname &quot;Preacher Mike&quot;.

The book occupies an important place in the film &quot;Captive&quot; released in 2015. This fact-based film tells the story of Ashley Smith, a young single mom of Atlanta, being held hostage by Brian Nichols, in her apartment for seven hours. Smith reported to news outlets that during this time she read chapter 32 of &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; to Nichols, which she credited as influencing his decision to release her from captivity. In 2012, Smith also stated that she had been struggling with drug addiction at the time, and she gave Nichols drugs to calm him down. Smith had to decide whether to do the drugs with Nichols. Smith chose not to, and she has not touched drugs since. Sales of &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; rose greatly, with the book becoming Amazon&#x27;s second-best-selling book after news of Smith&#x27;s captivity and release was announced.

<doc id="947148" wikidata="Q356760" url="?curid=947148" title="Taku Yamasaki">
<text>is a retired Japanese politician who served in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 2003 and from 2005 to 2009. He directed the Director General of the Japan Defense Agency for two months in 1989, and served as Minister of Construction from 1991 to 1992. He was a prominent faction leader in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and served as its Secretary-General and Vice President under Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

== Early life ==
Yamasaki was born in Dalian (then part of Manchukuo) during World War II. His family moved to Fukuoka following the end of the war. He lost his vision in one eye while in the third grade. He graduated from Waseda University in 1959 with a degree in commerce, and worked at Bridgestone for five years before entering politics.

Yamasaki was elected to the Fukuoka prefectural assembly in 1967, where he was discovered by future Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. Nakasone persuaded Yamasaki to run in the 1969 general election. Yamasaki was defeated in his first attempt to enter the Diet, but was successful in the 1972 general election.

== Diet career ==
While a Diet member, he served as Minister of Construction, and Director General of the Defense Agency. Yamasaki was an advocate of fiscal stimulus in the late 1990s, as Japan encountered a period of economic stagnation. As head of the LDP Policy Research Council, he advocated investing government-controlled postal savings and insurance funds into the stock market, and an escalation in government spending on telecommunications, environmental and education projects.

Yamasaki was implicated in a fundraising scandal in 1997, when an oil wholesaler accused of income tax evasion and fraud testified before a Diet committee that he had given Yamasaki 278 million yen in political donations, most of which was destined for other candidates.

He was a member of the &quot;YKK&quot; faction with Kōichi Katō and Jun&#x27;ichirō Koizumi, and also led a small faction that bore his name. He sought to oust the incumbent prime minister Keizō Obuchi in the LDP presidential election of 1999, but placed third among three candidates (Obuchi 350, Katō 113, Yamasaki 51). Obuchi attributed his victory to the support of Yoshirō Mori, who succeeded Obuchi as Prime Minister following Obuchi&#x27;s stroke and coma in early 2000. In November 2000, along with Katō, Yamasaki was heavily involved in a failed no confidence motion against Prime Minister Mori.

Koizumi was elected president of the LDP in 2001, and named Yamasaki to serve as its Secretary-General, the second most powerful leader in the party. Yamasaki was a vocal supporter of Koizumi&#x27;s reform efforts, which targeted the LDP&#x27;s traditional pork barrel constituencies.

Despite his prominence in the national party, Yamasaki faced close battles in his district in the 1996 election and the 2000 election. His district in urban Fukuoka Prefecture, with an electorate that frequently moved in and out of the region for work, was a favorable battleground for opposition candidates.

=== Scandals and electoral defeat ===
In September 2002, Yamasaki&#x27;s fundraising office was reported to have passed donations from construction companies to Yasushi Kaneko, an independent lawmaker supporting the Kawabe Dam project in Kumamoto Prefecture. In April 2003, Kanako Yamada alleged before a press conference of over 100 reporters that she had been &quot;Yamasaki&#x27;s mistress for a decade,&quot; and stated that Yamasaki &quot;never regards women as human beings.&quot; Yamasaki attempted to stop Yamada through a defamation lawsuit, but one of his lawsuits was rejected on the basis that the story was true. Following the Yamada revelations, Yamasaki became Vice President of the LDP, and was replaced as Secretary-General by Shinzo Abe.

In the November 2003 election, Yamasaki was defeated by Jun&#x27;ichirō Koga of the Democratic Party, and subsequently resigned from the vice-presidency of the LDP. Koga himself then encountered a scandal due to revelations that he had misrepresented his academic background. Yamasaki considered running in the 2004 House of Councillors election, but decided to keep his sights on returning to his previous constituency in the next election.

=== Final term in House of Representatives ===
Koga resigned in September 2004, and Yamasaki declared his candidacy for the by-election held in April 2005. Yamasaki won the by-election with support from Prime Minister Koizumi, who visited Fukuoka twice to campaign for Yamasaki.

Yamasaki, Shinzō Abe, and Foreign Minister Tarō Asō were all considered candidates to replace Koizumi after Koizumi&#x27;s term expired in September 2006. Abe was elected Prime Minister on 26 September 2006.

In the run-up to the 2009 general election, Yamasaki and Kato considered forming a new party to challenge the beleaguered LDP, and had discussions with both Shizuka Kamei and Ichiro Ozawa. Yamasaki remained with the LDP, and was defeated as the LDP suffered a crushing loss nationally. He was unable to run as a PR list candidate in the 2010 House of Councillors election due to LDP retirement age rules, and opted not to run into the 2012 general election, announcing his retirement from politics.

=== Post-retirement ===
Yamasaki made a joint appearance with Shizuka Kamei (former PNP leader), Hirohisa Fujii (former DPJ deputy president) and Masayoshi Takemura (former New Party Sakigake leader) in 2015 to express opposition to the security legislation proposed by the Abe government.

<doc id="947155" wikidata="Q656693" url="?curid=947155" title="Paquetá Island">
<text>Paquetá Island () is an island in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro. The name of the island is a Tupi word meaning &quot;many pacas&quot;. The island is an auto-free zone, so travel is limited to bicycles and horse-drawn carriages. Paquetá has twenty baobabs (a type of African tree).

== History ==

Up to the end of the 15th century, the Tamoio Indians used Paquetá as hunting and living grounds. It was officially registered by the Frenchman André Thevet in December 1555, and acknowledged by King Henri II as a French discovery in 1556. Together with Paranapuã Island (now called Governador Island), Paquetá was one of the main centers of French resistance to Portuguese occupation. While the French had the Tamoios as their allies, the Temiminós Indians led by Arariboia supported the Portuguese.

The Portuguese victory was consolidated with the expulsion of the French and the defeat of the Tamoios. Paquetá was then divided into two allotments assigned to settlers; the one now called Campo was given to Inácio de Bulhões and the Ponte area to Fernão Valdez. Even today the characteristics of this division between Campo and Ponte are conspicuously present in the Island&#x27;s festivities, in football matches and in the parade of dancing and singing groups during Carnival.

Under Portuguese rule, Paquetá produced vegetables, fruits, stone and timber for construction. Aristocratic land and slave owners occupied the island. Nowadays Paquetá presents a residential and touristy profile due to its cultural roots, its scenery and location.

== Traditional events ==
* Saint Roch (&quot;São Roque&quot;) Festival, in honor of the Island&#x27;s patron saint, is held along the week or on the weekend nearest to August 16 when the mass for Saint Roque is celebrated.
* Saint Peter (&quot;São Pedro&quot;) Festival, in honor of the patron saint of fishermen who keep the traditional maritime procession on June 29.

== Notable residents ==

* Marcos Paquetá (born 1958) – former Brazilian footballer
* Matheus Paquetá (born 1995) – Brazilian footballer
* Lucas Paquetá (born 1997) – Brazilian footballer

<doc id="947159" wikidata="Q2201925" url="?curid=947159" title="Anthocharis midea">
<text>Anthocharis midea, the falcate orangetip, is a North American butterfly that was described in 1809 by Jacob Hübner. It belongs to the family Pieridae, which is the white and sulphurs. These butterflies are mostly seen in the eastern United States, and in Texas and Oklahoma. They eat the nectar of violets and mustards. They tend to live in open, wet woods along waterways, in open swamps, and less often in dry woods and ridgetops. This species is a true springtime butterfly, being on the wing from April to May (March to May in southern Texas).

==Description==
The tip of the upper side of the male&#x27;s forewing is orange; females, however, lack this. Both have a round black spot located in the cell. The underside of the hindwing usually has intricate green marbling. The orangetips have a wingspan of around 3.5-4.5 centimeters.

==Similar species==

The only similar species in the falcate orangetip&#x27;s range is the Olympia marble (&quot;Euchloe olympia&quot;). The upper side of the Olympia marble&#x27;s forewing has a grayish-black apex and the underside of the hindwing has yellow-green marbling.

==Life cycle==
Males patrol hilltops and flats all day seeking females. Females lay their eggs singly on host plant flowers. The eggs are yellow green but turn red just before hatching. The larvae feed mainly at night and prefer to eat flowers, flower buds, and seed pods rather than leaves. They are also cannibalistic, devouring smaller larvae that may be feeding on the same plant. The larva is olive green with a yellow mid-dorsal stripe. There is a white spiracular stripe that runs the length of the body. The body has short hairs and is covered with tiny black dots. It can grow up to 3 centimeters long. The larvae pupate in mid-June. The chrysalis is a yellowish color and is covered with black spots. It also has a spike-like projection on the head which makes it look somewhat like a thorn. The chrysalis may overwinter for two or more years. This species has one brood per year.

==Host plants==
Host plants used by the falcate orangetip:

* &quot;Arabis glabra&quot;
* &quot;Arabidopsis lyrata&quot;
* &quot;Arabis serotina&quot;
* &quot;Barbarea verna&quot;
* &quot;Boechera canadensis&quot;
* &quot;Boechera grahamii&quot;
* &quot;Boechera laevigata&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine angustata&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine bulbosa&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine concatenata&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine diphylla&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine hirsuta&quot;
* &quot;Cardamine parviflora&quot;
* &quot;Lepidium densiflorum&quot;

<doc id="947163" wikidata="Q976963" url="?curid=947163" title="Fundoshi">
<text>is a traditional Japanese undergarment for males and females, made from a length of cotton.

Before World War II, the fundoshi was the main form of underwear for Japanese men and women. However, it fell out of use quickly after the war with the introduction of new underpants to the Japanese market, such as briefs, boxer briefs and panties. Nowadays, the fundoshi is mainly used not as underwear but as festival () clothing at or, sometimes, as swimwear.

==Types and uses==

The fundoshi is first mentioned in the classic Japanese history text, the . They are also depicted on clay figurines, . The fundoshi was the underwear of choice for all adults regardless of sex, wealth, or social status. This changed after the Second World War, when Americanization popularized elasticized undergarments. There are several types of fundoshi, including , , and .

Fundoshi are worn in several basic styles depending upon how they are wrapped around the body. The most relaxed type consists of a strip of cloth, wound around the hips, secured at the small of the back by knotting or twisting, with the excess brought forward between the legs, and tucked through the cloth belt in front to hang as an apron.

The (Japanese: 六尺ふんどし／六尺褌) is traditionally favored as activewear. Its name is derived from its traditional measurements of a cloth that is six (&quot;roku&quot;) () long and one shaku () wide. It is formed by winding the cloth around the hips, then bringing the excess length back between the legs to twist around the belt cloth at the back. The fundoshi is often twisted to create a thong effect at the back. This was worn as the standard male bathing suit. Male children were often told to wear this kind of fundoshi because a boy in trouble could be easily lifted out of the water by the back cloth of his fundoshi.

The third style, called (Japanese:越中褌), which originated in the vicinity of Toyama Prefecture, is a long rectangle of cloth with tapes at one narrow end. is a length of cloth; however, it has a strip of material at the waist to form a fastening or string. The dimensions are width by about length, and it is tied with the material strip in front of the body. One ties the tapes around the hips, with the cloth at the small of the back, and then pulls the cloth between the legs and through the belt, letting the remainder hang as an apron. Such was issued to Japanese troops in World War II, and often were the sole garb of Allied POWs in tropic areas.
The best material for this is white linen or white cotton. Silk crepe may be used according to one&#x27;s taste, but plain silk is not suitable. In winter it may be lined with similar material, but in other seasons it is always single. Both ends (or front and back) are hemmed to put cords through. One of the cords forms a loop to suspend the front end from the neck, and the other secures the back end by being tied in the front.

===Variations===

There are many other varieties of as there are many variations on the principle of a loincloth. For example, the (literally &quot;earth-basket loincloth&quot; because it looks like the traditional baskets used in construction), is made like the but without a front apron; the cloth is secured to the belt to make a bikini effect. The (literally &quot;black cat &quot;) is like the except that the portion that passes from front to back is tailored to create a thong effect. are not typically worn as everyday clothing. is mainly worn on specific, traditional occasions, particularly when participating in . During February, nearly 10,000 men will gather at Saidaiji Temple in Okayama wearing only to participate in the festival in hopes of gaining luck for the entire year.

The samurai wore as underwear with armor, combined with a shirt. Sumo wrestlers also wear a form of this garment, the . are often worn with a or (a short cotton jacket with straight sleeves) during summer festivals by men and women who carry (portable shrines) in Shinto processions. Outside Japan it is perhaps best known from the drumming groups Ondekoza and Kodo, who appear dressed in only a white and a headband. is sometimes used as traditional swimsuits. In some high schools, boys swim wearing . Incumbent Emperor of Japan Naruhito also swam in in his childhood. In the pools and beaches of Japan, -wearing swimmers occasionally can be seen, as in the case with divers in the past.

In late 2008, the Japanese firm Wacoal began marketing for women and have had greater than expected sales. The loincloths for women come in seven different colors and two designs—plain and chequered.

==Cultural comparisons==
The Japanese idiom (&#x27;tighten your loincloth&#x27;) means the same as the English phrase &quot;roll up your sleeves&quot; or even more accurately &quot;gird up your loins&quot;—in other words, get ready for some hard work. The Japanese idiom (literally, &#x27;anyone else&#x27;s &#x27;) is often used in a cautionary context about borrowing or using tools or materials belonging to someone else, the meaning extended to that of profiting at another&#x27;s expense or taking risks with someone else&#x27;s money.

<text>The Dinner Is Ruined is a Canadian indie rock band. the band plays an experimental and improvisational brand of blues rock. The band members are Dale Morningstar, Dave Clark and Dr. Johnny Pee.

==History==
The Dinner Is Ruined was formed in 1991 by multi-instrumentalist Dale Morningstar. Original members included Don Kerr on drums and Al Kelso on bass. They recorded their first album, &quot;Burn Your Dashiki&quot;, in 1991. After this point, Kelso left the band. Keyboardist/bassist Dr. Pee joined the group, and a second album, &quot;Love Songs from the Lubritorium&quot;, was recorded in 1993 by Raw Energy, Kerr left the band after this.

While opening for the band Rheostatics in 1994, Morningstar and Pee were booed and had objects thrown at them. Subsequently, Clark, at the time a member of Rheostatics, joined The Dinner is Ruined.

In 2000, the group released the album &quot;A Maggot in their Heads&quot;. The band continued to perform live, with often improvised instrumentation quite different from their recorded work.

In 2001 the band performed live at the Folk on the Rocks Festival in Yellowknife, backing up Gord Downie. This collaboration continued, and the members of The Dinner Is Ruined recorded as part of Gordon Downie&#x27;s backup band on his three solo albums. Downie&#x27;s band also included Julie Doiron and Skydiggers guitarist Josh Finlayson.

In 2014, The Dinner is Ruined backed up singer Kyp Harness on his album &quot;Armageddon Blues&quot;.

<doc id="947167" wikidata="Q7432872" url="?curid=947167" title="Schreier refinement theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Schreier refinement theorem of group theory states that any two subnormal series of subgroups of a given group have equivalent refinements, where two series are equivalent if there is a bijection between their factor groups that sends each factor group to an isomorphic one.

The theorem is named after the Austrian mathematician Otto Schreier who proved it in 1928. It provides an elegant proof of the Jordan–Hölder theorem. It is often proved using the Zassenhaus lemma. gives a short proof by intersecting the terms in one subnormal series with those in the other series.

== Example ==

Consider formula_1, where formula_2 is the symmetric group of degree 3. The alternating group formula_3 is a normal subgroup of formula_2, so we have the two subnormal series

: formula_5
: formula_6

with respective factor groups formula_7 and formula_8.&lt;br&gt;
The two subnormal series are not equivalent, but they have equivalent refinements:

: formula_9

with factor groups isomorphic to formula_10 and

: formula_11

with factor groups isomorphic to formula_12.

<doc id="947175" wikidata="Q17157287" url="?curid=947175" title="Ridgeway, Ontario">
<text>Ridgeway is a small, unincorporated village in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada. The community is within the Niagara Regional Municipality. It used to be the seat of government for Bertie Township within Welland County. Ridgeway is now a part of the Town of Fort Erie. In recent years the rail line has been converted to a walking and cycling trail, part of a trail system circling the Niagara region.

==History==
Ridgeway takes its name from the limestone ridge which runs through it from north to south. The main street of town aptly named Ridge Road, follows this ridge, and was part of one of the first two wagon trails in Bertie Township, connecting Point Abino on Lake Erie to Miller’s Creek on the Niagara River.

Ridgeway was settled by the United Empire loyalists in the late 18th-century, and was originally a farming community. In the 1850s the Buffalo, Brantford and Goderich Railway line was put through, and service industries began to develop around the train stop on Ridge Road. The business district spread north from there towards Dominion Road. In 1873 the post office was opened, having been moved from Point Abino.

===Battle of Ridgeway===

It is notable for being the location of the 1866 Battle of Ridgeway, resulting from a raid by the Irish-American Fenian Brotherhood near the intersection of Ridge and Garrison Roads on June 2, 1866. Irish-American revolutionaries known as Fenians invaded Canada as part of an attempt to oust the British and create an independent Irish republic.
This was the largest of these border skirmishes. Canadian militiamen under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Booker arrived by train and marched to battle the invaders. The Fenians retired to Fort Erie and returned to Buffalo the same night. The Battle of Ridgeway shocked the country, spurring improvements to Canada’s defenses, and helping to bolster the movement for confederation, which took place the next year.

==Events==
Ridgeway is home to the Ridgeway Shores Golf Club (now closed) and Cherry Hill Club which once hosted the Canadian Open golf tournament in 1972.

===Ridgeway Summer Festival ===
Within the Town of Fort Erie, the Village of Ridgeway offers Victorian charm to visitors and residents. The Ridgeway Summer Festival is held every year on the second weekend in July. The streets are closed off, and thousands of visitors stroll the historical downtown enjoying music, food, vendors, and shows. An event called Spirit of Christmas is held on the first weekend in December, Friday evening and Saturday only, featuring horse-drawn carriage rides, school choirs singing outdoors, Victorian carollers, strolling Santa, food and more.

==Geography==
Fort Erie area is generally flat, but there are low sand hills, varying in height from 2 to 15 metres, along the shore of Lake Erie, and a limestone ridge extends from Crystal Beach to near Miller&#x27;s Creek, giving Ridgeway its name. The soil is shallow, with a clay subsoil.

Situated just north of Crystal Beach and Bay Beach which are considered the best beaches in the area and draw many weekend visitors from the Toronto and Buffalo areas. While summers are enjoyable, winters can occasionally be fierce, with many snowstorms, whiteouts and winds whipping off Lake Erie.

==Communities==
Ridgeway is one of the neighbourhoods of Fort Erie, along with Black Creek, Bridgeburg/NorthEnd/Victoria, Crescent Park, Crystal Beach, Point Abino, Snyder, and Stevensville.

Fort Erie Secondary School and Ridgeway-Crystal Beach High School are the two public high schools serving Fort Erie and area communities. The 2 schools closed in June 2017 due to low populations and have combined into Greater Fort Erie Secondary School serving all areas of Fort Erie.

==Climate==
==History==
The Fort Erie area contains deposits of flint, and became important in the production of spearheads, arrowheads, and other tools. In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Niagara Peninsula was inhabited by the Neutral Nation, so named by the French because they tried to remain neutral between the warring Huron and Iroquois peoples. In 1650, during the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois Confederacy declared war on the Neutral Nation, driving them from their traditional territory by 1651, and practically annihilating them by 1653. The Battle of Ridgeway (1866) was fought near here, as part of a Fenian invasion of Canada from the United States.
The Grand Trunk Railway built the International Railway Bridge in 1873, bringing about a new town, originally named Victoria and subsequently renamed to Bridgeburg, north of the original settlement of Fort Erie. By 1876, Ridgeway had an estimated population of 800, the village of Fort Erie has an estimated population of 1,200, and Victoria boasted three railway stations. By 1887, Stevensville had an estimated population of &quot;nearly 600&quot;, Victoria of &quot;nearly 700&quot;, Ridgeway of &quot;about 600&quot;, and Fort Erie of &quot;about 4,000&quot;.
In 1970, the provincial government consolidated the various villages in what had been Bertie Township, including the then town of Fort Erie, into the present Town of Fort Erie.

==Demographics==
The 2011 Census of Canada indicated a population of 29,960 for Fort Erie. This was a 0.1% increase over the 2006 Census. The median household income in 2005 for Fort Erie was $47,485, which was below the Ontario provincial average of $60,455.

According to the 2001 census, the population was 28,143, broken down as follows: 92.8% White, 3.2% Aboriginal, 1.4% Chinese, 0.9% Black, and a very small percentage of Asian, Arab, and Hispanic populations.

==Transportation==
Ontario Highway 3 runs through Ridgeway and was named King&#x27;s Highway 3A from 1927 to 1929, Within Ridgeway, Highway 3 is named Garrison Road, and is the major East-West connection through the town. Dominion Road was designated as King&#x27;s Highway 3C from 1934 until 1970, when it was downloaded to the newly formed Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Niagara Regional Road 1.

==Trails==
Fort Erie is the eastern terminus of the Friendship Trail, and the southern terminus of the Niagara River Recreation Pathway. Both trails are part of the Trans-Canada Trail system.

<text>In computing, a button (sometimes known as a command button or push button) is a graphical control element that provides the user a simple way to trigger an event, like searching for a query at a search engine, or to interact with dialog boxes, like confirming an action.

==Overview==
A typical button is a rectangle or rounded rectangle, wider than it is tall, with a descriptive caption in its center. Other buttons may be square or round, with simple icons.

The most common method of pressing a button is clicking it with a pointer controlled by a mouse, or a touchpad, but other input such as keystroke can be used to execute the command of a button. However, a button is not always restricted to a rectangular shape.

The sole requirement of button interaction is that the user can execute a command by a click action. Thus, pictures and background areas can be programmed as buttons. When pressed, in addition to performing a predetermined task, buttons often undergo a graphical change to mimic a mechanical button being depressed.

Depending on the circumstance, buttons may be designated to be pushed only once and execute a command, while others may be used to receive instant feed back and may require the user to click more than once to receive the desired result. Other buttons are designed to toggle behavior on and off like a check box. These buttons will show a graphical clue (such as staying depressed after the mouse is released) to indicate the state of the option. Such a button may be called a latch button or a latching switch.

A button often displays a tooltip when a user moves the pointer over it, especially if the button&#x27;s content is a standalone icon. The tooltip serves as built-in documentation that briefly explains the purpose of the button. If you hover your mouse over the blue window button below (without clicking it or moving your mouse), it will display a text saying &quot;Window (computing).&quot;

Some very common incarnations of the button widget are:
* An &quot;OK button&quot; for confirming actions and closing the windows
* A &quot;Cancel button&quot; for canceling actions and closing the window
* An &quot;Apply button&quot; for confirming actions without closing the window
* A &quot;Close button&quot; for closing windows after changes have already been applied

==Appearance==

=== macOS ===

Buttons in macOS&#x27;s Aqua interface are usually depicted as rounded-rectangles of crystallized glass. Normally these buttons are light grey in color and turn blue when pressed. The button with keyboard focus (selectable with the spacebar) appears with a blue glow surrounding it. The default button in an active window (selectable with the return key) animates between a bright blue and a darker blue (the same color as a pressed button).

Also used, primarily within application toolbars, are slightly rounded rectangles with a light grey metallic appearance. These buttons appear darker and &quot;pushed inward&quot; when pressed.

Window management controls appear in the top left corner of each window. These buttons are similar in style to standard aqua buttons, but are color-coded as a memory aid. From left to right, these are: &quot;Close Window&quot;, shown in red; &quot;Minimize Window&quot;, shown in yellow; and &quot;Zoom&quot;, shown in green, which causes the window to resize to best fit its contents.

=== Windows shell ===
Buttons in Microsoft Windows are usually rectangular, with mildly rounded corners in Windows XP, Vista, and 7, in Windows 11. In Windows 8, the buttons are rectangular with sharp corners. A button with active focus is shown with a black dotted line just inside the border of the button. In addition, more recent versions, the default button is shown with a blue border. In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the default button will slowly fade between its normal appearance and the blue border. Window management controls are in the upper right-hand corner of the application window, and, from left to right: &quot;minimize&quot; the window (causing it to disappear into the taskbar at the bottom of the screen); &quot;maximize&quot; the window (causing it to expand to cover the whole screen; if the window is already maximized, the button will restore it to its previous size and position); and close the window.

=== Linux and other Unix-like systems ===
The appearance and behavior of buttons in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems is defined primarily by which widget toolkit is being employed, the most popular being GTK and Qt, though other toolkits are used as well. The use of multiple toolkits can lead to less uniform look and feel across applications. Most widget toolkits also have theming capabilities, so there is no single standard appearance as there is with Mac OS and Windows.

=== HTML ===
Buttons appear as elements of HTML forms to carry out actions such as clearing user input or submitting the form contents to the server. Buttons specified in HTML may be rendered by web browsers in different ways, typically either using the native button appearance of the underlying OS, or by using a button definition from within the browser. Buttons may also be styled by the developer of the web site the form appears on by using cascading style sheets.

HTML links are sometimes represented by a graphic closely resembling a button. Sometimes this type of link is used in advertisements to induce the user to click the ad and visit the advertiser&#x27;s site.

<doc id="947180" wikidata="Q640932" url="?curid=947180" title="Stiffkey">
<text>Stiffkey () is a village and civil parish on the north coast of the English county of Norfolk. It is situated on the A149 coast road, some east of Wells-next-the-Sea, west of Blakeney, and north-west of the city of Norwich.
The civil parish has an area of and in the 2001 census had a population of 223 in 105 households, the population falling to 209 at the 2011 Census.

For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of North Norfolk.

The parish church of St John the Baptist is a Grade I listed building.

The River Stiffkey runs through the village, from which it takes its name. The river was used to power the Stiffkey watermill which was built before 1579. It was a small mill, running two pairs of stones, and it operated until 1881 when it was put up for auction as a warehouse. Little now remains of the mill; just a few low ruined walls showing the position of the building.

Stiffkey is noted for cockles &quot;Cerastoderma edule&quot; which still retain the old name of &#x27;Stewkey blues&#x27;. These are stained blue by the mud in which they live.

==Etymology and geology==
Stiffkey is first evidenced in the Domesday Book of 1086, and means &#x27;stump island, island with stumps of trees&#x27;.

The local historical pronunciation of the village is &#x27;Stiff-key&#x27; and not ‘Stew-key’. The mis-pronunciation is primarily due to the underlying glauconitic clays (blue-green clays – formerly Blue Marl), BGS lexicon lithological description: Pale to dark grey or blue-grey clay or mudstone, glauconitic in part, with a sandy base. Discrete bands of phosphatic nodules (commonly preserving fossils), some pyrite and calcareous nodules. In Norfolk, the Cretaceous Gault Formation becomes calcareous before passing northwards into the Hunstanton Formation (&quot;Red Chalk&quot;). In places thin, variable junction beds at the base include some limestones. (BGS lexicon: Gault Formation which belongs to the Selbourne Group).

The blue clays are known locally as &#x27;Norfolk Stew&#x27;, hence the name &#x27;Stew-Key&#x27; [Stew-quay] as the flats there and the quays use the underlying blue clays (muds) weathered from Cretaceous bedrock. As already noted the local fauna of cockles can be stained with relation to their habitat. Glauconite is an iron- and potassium-rich mineral and the solid phase reactions can produce the iron- and potassium-rich dye Prussian blue.

The correct and locally used pronunciation is ‘Stiff-key’. In the Domesday book it is spelt ‘Stiucai’, when this was written there weren&#x27;t separate letters for ‘V’ and ‘U’. All names with a ‘V’ sound were spelt with a ‘U’. It is thought that ‘Stew-key’ arose from the mis-reading of the Domesday spelling.

Later on English spelling evolved, and by 1300 the spelling ‘Styfkey’ appeared in documents, which is pretty hard to mid-represent. [Stiffkey with Cockthorpe: A story of Norfolk People, 2013].

==Wildlife sites==
Forming part of the Blakeney Point, a National nature reserve, the Stiffkey Salt Marshes create an extensive habitat for a wide range of birds and plant life. The salt marshes which are owned and managed by the National Trust are open to the public.

Stiffkey Fen is nature reserve located close to the village covering . The reserve is open to the public, and has a reed bed and freshwater lagoons providing a habitat for many species of birds. In October 2020, a rufous bush chat was found at Stiffkey, the first time this species had been seen in Britain since 1980.

==Military camp==
An artillery and anti-aircraft training camp was established south of the marshes in 1938 and remained in operation throughout World War II. Aircraft from RAF Langham would tow targets over the marshes for the trainee gunners to aim at. After the war the camp was used for training USAAF B-29 gunners until the site&#x27;s closure in 1955. Vestiges of the former camp can still be seen including the remains of a circular runway, known locally as &#x27;The Whirlygig&#x27;, used by the USAAF to launch radio-controlled aerial targets. The former officers&#x27; mess is now a boat restoration charity workshop and visitor centre and other surviving buildings have been converted to agricultural use or incorporated into the present day holiday camp site.

==Notable people==
Member of Parliament Sir Nathaniel Bacon (1546?–1622), second son of Sir Nicholas Bacon and half-brother of Sir Francis Bacon, was buried in Stiffkey church.

The village is remembered as the parish whose rector, Harold Davidson, faced charges of immorality and was defrocked in 1932. He was a popular priest in the area and the villagers asked his family to allow him to be buried in Stiffkey when he died, rather than in the family tomb in Sholing, where he was born. They have cared for his grave for many years. (He died, rather improbably, after he was mauled by a lion.)

The author Henry Williamson bought a farm in Stiffkey. &quot;The Story of a Norfolk Farm&quot; (1941) is his account of his first years of farming here.

On 11 May 1978, the author, soldier and politician Aubrey Buxton was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Buxton of Alsa, of Stiffkey in the County of Norfolk&quot;. He died there in 2009.

Singer Dennis Lotis resided in Stiffkey until his death.

The British explorer and secret agent Frederick Marshman Bailey (1882–1967) spent his final years in Stiffkey.

==Public access==
The Norfolk Coast Path runs between the village and the sea and further on to Blakeney to the East and Wells-next-the-Sea to the West. Sanders Coaches Coast Hopper CH1 bus service connects Stiffkey with Wells-next-the-Sea and Cromer.

<text>A tortillon (; also blending stump) is a cylindrical drawing tool, tapered at the end and usually made of rolled paper. It is used by artists to smudge or blend marks made with charcoal, Conté crayon, pencil or other drawing media.

A blending stump is similar to a tortillon but is longer, more tightly wrapped, and pointed at both ends. Tortillons produce slightly different textures than stumps when blending, and they are hollow, whereas stumps are solid.

Cleaning of tortillons and stumps usually involves removing the used outer layer of paper by scraping or rubbing it on an abrasive surface, such as sandpaper, carpet, rubber erasers, or an emery board. Some people also whittle off the tip if it becomes dull, or mashed in.

<text>Six TV was the sixth free to air terrestrial television channel in the United Kingdom, broadcast in Oxford and Southampton. It was the final analogue network to have been launched after BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. It operated under a set of Restricted Television Service Licences, broadcasting on UHF channel 47 in Oxford and channel 29 in Southampton. It was owned by Oxford Broadcasting, who launched the channel in 1999; Oxford Broadcasting was sold to Milestone Group in 2001, who closed all operations by April 2009.

==Launch and expansion==
Oxford Broadcasting was founded in 1998 by Debora and Thomas Harding, who both had worked at Oxford-based video production company Undercurrents. They applied for a local television licence and were successful. They raised the capital to launch the station, set up a broadcast studio in an old nuclear bunker on Woodstock Road, and hired over 60 staff. From the beginning, the channel focused on local stories, particularly sports, business, arts, music and politics.

The Oxford Channel was launched on 6 June 1999. Within a few months, the station&#x27;s programming had built a considerable following: over 25% of the potential audience of 500,000 watched each week. Advertising for the station was produced by Tom, Dick and Debbie Productions, founded by Debora &amp; Thomas Harding and Richard Lewis.

According to a Reuters Institute report, the channel &quot;also had a strong training programme, which made formal in 2000 through the Local Television Training company that attracted government money to train unemployed young people from Oxford and taught them the skills of broadcast television. This scheme had a high success rate of placing trainees within the television industry.&quot;

In 2001, the board voted to sell the loss-making station and its operating company to Milestone Group. During this transition, most of the staff were laid off by Milestone, who also laid off the station&#x27;s founders, though a small percentage of the staff remained.

Milestone gained further licences to broadcast in Southampton, Fawley, Reading and Portsmouth in 2003 after the re-advertising of the four-year contracts, and successfully renewed its contract to broadcast to Oxford. The station was re-branded as Six TV in anticipation of the launch of these services.

The channel broadcast a 24-hour service, seven days a week and featured numerous local programmes including a motoring show &quot;V6&quot; presented by Chris Ford, as well as an interactive music programme &quot;OX900&quot;, and wildlife series &quot;Wild&quot;, which was nominated for an RTS Award. It also introduced a children&#x27;s section, local sports, and local news under the guidance of managing director, Nigel Taylor.

==Fate==
The channel&#x27;s contract to broadcast was set to expire on 30 June 2007; however, Ofcom confirmed that all RSL licences would be extended until the 2012 digital switchover but gave no undertaking that a digital licence would be granted. Milestone concluded that the lack of digital licences rendered the stations non-viable, and all channels had ceased broadcasting by April 2009, including the original Oxford channel.

<doc id="947196" wikidata="Q7873130" url="?curid=947196" title="USS Providence (1775)">
<text>USS &quot;Providence&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the Continental Navy, originally chartered by the Rhode Island General Assembly as &quot;Katy&quot;. The ship took part in a number of campaigns during the first half of the American Revolutionary War before being destroyed by her own crew in 1779 to prevent her falling into the hands of the British after the failed Penobscot Expedition.

==Service as &quot;Katy&quot;==

From early 1775, Royal Navy warships, in particular the post ship , carried out anti-smuggling operations off the New England coast. They frequently searched Rhode Island merchant shipping, annoying the colony&#x27;s merchants. On 13 June, Deputy Governor Nicholas Cooke wrote the frigate&#x27;s Captain James Wallace demanding restoration of several ships which &quot;Rose&quot; had detained. Two days later, the Rhode Island General Assembly ordered the committee of safety to fit out two ships to defend the colony&#x27;s shipping, and appointed a committee of three to obtain the vessels. That day, the committee chartered the sloop &quot;Katy&quot; from John Brown of Providence and the sloop &quot;Washington&quot; at the same time. The General Assembly appointed Abraham Whipple as commander of &quot;Katy&quot;, the larger ship, and made him commodore of the tiny fleet. Whipple had won fame in burning the British armed schooner &quot;Gaspee&quot; in 1772, and he captured a tender to HMS &quot;Rose&quot; before sunset that same day. &quot;Katy&quot; then cruised in Narragansett Bay through the summer protecting coastal shipping.

Gunpowder was an essential commodity, scarce in the Continental Army throughout the Revolutionary War and desperately low during the first year of the struggle for independence. Late in the summer of 1775, the shortage in Washington&#x27;s army besieging Boston became so severe that he was unable to use his artillery, and his riflemen would have been unable to repel an attack had the British taken the offensive. Cooke, therefore, ordered Whipple to cruise for two weeks off Sandy Hook, New Jersey to intercept a powder-laden packet expected from London. He was then to proceed to Bermuda to capture the powder stored in the British magazine there. &quot;Katy&quot; departed Narragansett Bay on 12 September but caught no sight of the packet. Upon reaching Bermuda, Whipple learned that the powder from the magazine was already en route to Philadelphia.

==Service as &quot;Providence&quot;==
&quot;Katy&quot; was purchased by Rhode Island 31 October 1775, soon after she returned to Providence. Late in November, she sailed for Philadelphia carrying seamen enlisted by Commodore Esek Hopkins in New England for Continental service. She arrived on 3 December and was immediately taken into Continental service and renamed &quot;Providence&quot;.

Captain Whipple assumed command of , a larger ship, and Captain John Hazard was placed in command of &quot;Providence&quot;, formalized by a commission from the Continental Congress dated 9 January 1776. The ships joined a squadron being formed by Congress under the command of Esek Hopkins, who was Commander in Chief of the Fleet of the United Colonies; they ordered him to sail for Chesapeake Bay on 5 January 1776 and to clear waters there of a fleet organized the previous autumn by Governor Dunmore of Virginia. These English and Tory ships had ravaged the shores of the bay and the rivers which empty into it. Once Whipple&#x27;s ships had completed this task, they were to move south and clear the Carolina coast of enemy shipping, then sail North to Rhode Island to perform a similar service.

&quot;Providence&quot; and her consorts departed Philadelphia early in January but were delayed by ice and did not get to sea until 17 February. Hopkins deemed it unwise to cruise along the southern coast and led his little fleet to the Abaco Islands in the Bahamas, which they reached on 1 March and staged for a raid on New Providence. The next day, they seized two sloops on which Hopkins placed a landing party of 200 marines and 50 sailors. The Americans went ashore unopposed on the eastern end of New Providence at mid-morning of the 3rd, under cover of the guns of &quot;Providence&quot; and . They advanced toward Fort Montagu which opened fire, interrupting the invaders&#x27; progress. The defenders spiked their guns and retreated to Fort Nassau. The next day, Nassau surrendered and gave the Americans the keys to the Fort. Hopkins then brought his ships into the harbor and spent two weeks loading captured munitions before heading home on 17 March.

Hopkins’ ships captured the schooner off Block Island on 4 April, belonging to the British fleet at Newport, Rhode Island, and they took the brig &quot;Bolton&quot; at dawn the next day. That evening, the Americans added a brigantine and a sloop to their list of prizes, both from New York. About 1 a.m. on 6 April, sighted , a 20-gun sloop carrying dispatches from Newport to Charleston, South Carolina. The American fleet engaged the enemy ship for 1.5 hours before she turned and fled back toward Newport. After daylight, Hopkins ordered his ships to give up the chase and headed with his fleet and prizes for New London, Connecticut, where they arrived on the 8th.

Lieutenant John Paul Jones took command of &quot;Providence&quot; on 10 May and made a voyage to New York, returning about 100 soldiers to the Continental Army whom Washington had lent to Hopkins to help man the American fleet, and Jones then hove down the ship to clean her bottom. She sailed again on 13 June, escorting &quot;Fly&quot; to Fishers Island at the entrance to Long Island Sound. He rescued a brigantine en route from the British frigate , bringing munitions from Hispaniola.

&quot;Providence&quot; next escorted a convoy of colliers to Philadelphia, arriving 1 August, and Jones received his permanent commission as captain a week later. &quot;Providence&quot; departed the Delaware Capes on the 21st to begin an independent cruise; she took the brigantine &quot;Britannia&quot; soon after and sent her into Philadelphia under a prize crew. On 1 September, daring seamanship enabled Jones to escape from the British frigate . Two days later, &quot;Providence&quot; captured the Bermudan brigantine &quot;Sea Nymph&quot; carrying sugar, rum, ginger, and oil and sent her to Philadelphia. On the 6th, &quot;Providence&quot; caught the brigantine &quot;Favourite&quot; carrying sugar from Antigua to Liverpool, but recaptured the prize before she could reach an American port.

Turning north, Jones headed for Nova Scotia and escaped another frigate on 20 September before his raid on Canso two days later. There he recruited men to fill the vacancies created by manning his prizes, burned a British fishing schooner, sank a second, and captured a third besides a shallop which he used as a tender. &quot;Providence&quot; took several more prizes fishing near Ile Madame before riding out a severe storm. The whaler &quot;Portland&quot; surrendered to her before she returned to Narragansett Bay on 8 October.

While &quot;Providence&quot; was at home, Hopkins appointed Jones the commander of , a larger ship and the Commander in Chief&#x27;s flagship on the expedition to the Bahamas, and Captain Hoysted Hacker took command of &quot;Providence&quot;. The two ships got under way 11 November. They took the brigantine &quot;Active&quot; after ten days and the armed transport &quot;Mellish&quot; the next day, carrying winter uniforms and military supplies for the British Army. On the 16th, they captured the snow &quot;Kitty&quot;. &quot;Providence&quot; had been troubled by leaks which developed during bad weather on the cruise, so she headed back for Rhode Island and arrived at Newport two days later.

The British seized Narragansett Bay in December 1776 and &quot;Providence&quot; retired up the Providence River with other American vessels. She ran the British blockade in February 1777 under Lt. Jonathan Pitcher and put into New Bedford, then cruised to Cape Breton where she captured a transport brig loaded with stores and carrying two officers and 25 men of the British Army, besides her crew. She made two cruises on the coast under command of Captain John Peck Rathbun, and sailed from Georgetown, N.C. about mid-January 1778, again bound for New Providence in the Bahamas but this time alone. On 27 January, she spiked the guns of the fort at Nassau, taking military stores including 1,600 pounds of powder and releasing 30 American prisoners. She also captured a 16-gun British ship and recaptured five other vessels which had been brought in by the British. On 30 January, the prizes were manned and sailed away, except two that were burned, and &quot;Providence&quot; put into New Bedford with her armed prize.

During the early part of April 1779, &quot;Providence&quot; was ordered to make a short cruise in Massachusetts Bay and along the coast of Maine. She later sailed south of Cape Cod and captured the brig , 12 guns off Sandy Hook on 7 May. She fired two broadsides and a volley of muskets during the engagement and &quot;Diligent&quot; was forced to surrender, with mast rigging and hull cut to pieces. &quot;Providence&quot; was then assigned to Commodore Saltonstall&#x27;s squadron which departed Boston on 19 July 1779 and entered Penobscot Bay 25 July.

&quot;Providence&quot; was destroyed by her crew, along with other American vessels in the Penobscot River on 14 August 1779 to prevent her from falling into the hands of the British towards the end of the failed Penobscot Expedition.

==Reproduction==
In the early 1970s a reproduction of the &quot;Providence&quot; was constructed with a fiberglass hull and was used for youth sail training. The ship was maintained by the Providence Maritime Heritage Foundation. The ship was commissioned by John Fitzhugh Millar who was the captain of the replica frigate &quot;Rose&quot; in the 1970s.

She was launched in 1976 and designated in 1992 as the flagship and tall ship ambassador of the state of Rhode Island. The ship was in drydock for the winter of 2015, when she was toppled and severely damaged by high winds during the January 2015 nor&#x27;easter.

&quot;Providence&quot; is currently docked in Alexandria, Virginia, under the care of the Tall Ship Providence Foundation. The ship now offers tours, sails, and educational programs to tourists and locals alike.

<doc id="947197" wikidata="Q4918657" url="?curid=947197" title="La Academia">
<text>La Academia (&quot;The Academy&quot;) is a Mexican reality musical talent television series shown on TV Azteca, that premiered in June 2002 and is currently in its thirteenth installment. Although the show itself is not affiliated with the Endemol franchise, which includes the &quot;Star Academy&quot; shows, it does share the competition format of many of the variants of the global franchise.

Over the first seasons, the show was a reliable dominator of its time-slot, which was shown by its triumph over Televisa&#x27;s &quot;Operación Triunfo Mexico&quot;, in several countries including Chile, Peru and Venezuela. The rival show was only produced for one season, and was in fact the official Endemol entry in Mexico. The last seasons of &quot;La Academia&quot; had declining ratings, being aired against the Mexican version of &quot;The Voice&quot;, produced by Televisa, and it eventually ceased production in 2012. However, in 2018, Azteca rebooted the franchise and it aired a new generation of &quot;La Academia&quot; which received positive reviews from critics and saw an impressive increase in total viewership.

The show has been franchised to other countries: Azerbaijan (&quot;Akademiya&quot;), Malaysia (&quot;Akademi Fantasia&quot;), Indonesia (&quot;Akademi Fantasi Indosiar&quot;), United States (&quot;La Academia USA&quot;), Paraguay (&quot;La Academia Paraguay&quot;), Singapore (&quot;Sunsilk Academy Fantasia&quot;), Thailand (&quot;True Academy Fantasia&quot;), Central America (&quot;La Academia Centroamérica&quot;) and Greece (&quot;House of Fame&quot;).

==Overview==

===Format===
Each year, 14–49 people are selected to live together in a house isolated from the rest of the world, spending their days taking classes in singing, dancing, acting, and related fields, each preparing one or two songs for a 3-hour concert which they give each Sunday evening for TV viewers and a live studio audience. Each week, one of the contestants is eliminated based on the number of votes each one receives, until 4 to 10 students become the finalists and compete for the top prize. Viewers can vote by telephone, text or online. 
&quot;Camino a la Fama&quot; aired during weekday afternoons, but it was cancelled after &quot;The Ninth Generation&quot;. This show taped what the students&#x27; lives within the &quot;La Academia&quot; house. It also demonstrated the singing, dancing, and acting classes.

===Judges and hosts===
The longest serving judge has been Arturo López Gavito with ten seasons on the panel, followed by Lolita Cortés five seasons as judge plus two as the academy&#x27;s director. Óscar Sarquiz, Chacho Gaytán and Horacio Villalobos remain in third place, having been part of the judging panel three seasons each.

Whereas for hosts, Alan Tacher and Rafael Araneda both were part of the show for four seasons each, with Ingrid Coronado hosting three seasons. Judge and host Yahir, and two-time host Cynthia Rodríguez are two of the academy&#x27;s students who have been part of the panel.


==Series overview==

===Notes===

# In the first and second series, the judges&#x27; panel rotated between different music experts every week, regular guests are listed.
# During the eighth series, several guest judges served as temporary replacement for Olga Tañón, such as: Marta Sánchez, Mónica Naranjo, María Conchita Alonso, Elvis Crespo, Tatiana, Dulce, Los Horóscopos de Durango, Gabriela Spanic, Eduardo Capetillo, and Bibi Gaytán
# Paolo is considered the winner of the Judges&#x27; International Prize.
# Myriam joined the judges&#x27; panel on Concert 5.
==Main Generations==

===Season 1: The First Generation (2002)===
&quot;La Academia&quot; began on July 7, 2002. Fourteen were selected to be part of &quot;The First Generation&quot;, and Alan Tacher was selected to host. The National Auditorium in Mexico City served as the setting for the final concert, where the winner received a Coca-Cola touring contract, a worldwide trip, a brand new Chevrolet Trail Blazer and the top prize: MX$2.5 million and a recording contract.

Miguel Ángel, Myriam, Nadia, Víctor and Yahir reached the finale held on December 1, 2002. Myriam Montemayor Cruz was declared the winner of &quot;La Academia&quot;.

===Season 2: The Second Generation (2002–03)===

&quot;The Second Generation&quot; was presented at the final concert of &quot;The First Generation&quot; on December 1, 2002. Once again, the National Auditorium in Mexico City served as the setting for the final concert, where the winner received the top prize of MX$2.5 million and a recording contract.

Freddi, Manuel, Marco, Rosalía and Érika reached the finale held on March 30, 2003. Érika Alcocer Luna was declared the second winner of &quot;La Academia&quot;.

===Season 3: The Third Generation (2004)===

<doc id="947209" wikidata="Q3140473" url="?curid=947209" title="Horace Smith (poet)">
<text>Horace (born Horatio) Smith (31 December 1779 – 12 July 1849) was an English poet and novelist. In 1818, he participated in a sonnet-writing competition with Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was of Smith that Shelley said: &quot;Is it not odd that the only truly generous person I ever knew who had money enough to be generous with should be a stockbroker? He writes poetry and pastoral dramas and yet knows how to make money, and does make it, and is still generous.&quot;

==Biography==
Smith was born in London, the fifth of eight children, son of Robert Smith (1747–1832) F.R.S. and his wife Mary Bogle. His niece was the poet Maria Abdy. He was educated at Chigwell School with his elder brother James Smith, also a writer. Horace first came to public attention in 1812 at the time of the rebuilding of the Drury Lane Theatre, after it had burnt down; the managers offered a prize of £50 for an address to be recited at the Theatre&#x27;s reopening in October. The Smith brothers wrote parodies of poets of the day, supposedly their failed entries in the competition, and sold the collection under the title &quot;Rejected Addresses&quot;. James parodied Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge and Crabbe, while Horace parodied Byron, Moore, Scott and Bowles.

Smith went on to become a prosperous stockbroker. He travelled with family in continental Europe from 1821 to 1825. Returning to England, he first took a house in Tunbridge Wells, and then moved to Brighton in 1826. He died at Tunbridge Wells on 12 July 1849.

==Works==
&quot;The Rejected Addresses&quot;, with seven editions within three months, still stands the most widely popular parodies ever published in the country. The book was written without malice; none of the poets caricatured took offence, while the imitation is so clever that both Byron and Scott claimed that they could scarcely believe they had not written the addresses ascribed to them. The only other collaboration by the two brothers was &quot;Horace in London&quot; (1813). His comedy play &quot;First Impressions&quot; was performed at Drury Lane in 1813.

Smith knew Shelley as a member of the circle around Leigh Hunt. Smith helped to manage Shelley&#x27;s finances. Sonnet-writing competitions were not uncommon; Shelley and Smith wrote competing sonnets on the subject of the Nile River. Inspired by Diodorus Siculus (Book 1, Chapter 47), they each wrote and submitted a sonnet on the subject to &quot;The Examiner&quot;. Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Ozymandias&quot; was published on 11 January 1818 under the pen name Glirastes, and Smith&#x27;s poem of the same title was published on 1 February 1818 with the same title under the initials H.S. (and was later renamed in his collection &quot;Amarynthus&quot; as &quot;On a Stupendous Leg of Granite, Discovered Standing by Itself in the Deserts of Egypt, with the Inscription Inserted Below&quot;).

After making his fortune in business, Horace Smith produced around twenty historical novels: &quot;Brambletye House&quot; (1826), &quot;Tor Hill&quot; (1826), &quot;Reuben Apsley&quot; (1827), &quot;Zillah&quot; (1828), &quot;The New Forest&quot; (1829), &quot;Walter Colyton&quot; (1830), among others. Three volumes of &quot;Gaieties and Gravities&quot;, published by him in 1826, contain many clever essays both in verse and prose, but the only piece that remains much remembered is the &quot; Address to the Mummy in Belzoni&#x27;s Exhibition.&quot; (see Giovanni Battista Belzoni)

<text>Bački Petrovac (; ; ) is a town and municipality located in the South Bačka District of the autonomous province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The town has a population of 5,227, while the municipality has 11,512 inhabitants.

==Name==
In Serbian Cyrillic the town is known as Бачки Петровац, in Serbian Latin as &quot;Bački Petrovac&quot;, in Slovak as &quot;Petrovec&quot; or &quot;Báčsky Petrovec&quot;, in Hungarian as &quot;Petrőc&quot;, and in German as &quot;Petrovacz&quot;.

Bački Petrovac is the economical, cultural and administrative center of the municipality. It is a settlement of a town character, while the other three are villages of Pannonian type.

==History==
Being in south Bačka which according to special climatic and other conditions is one of the most fertile parts of Serbia, very suitable for settling down, here in this region people made their settlements very early. The first written records about Petrovac appears in the 13th century when Petrovac is mentioned as a church parish belonging to Bač County. Later that name is changed into Petrovac. Its first inhabitants were the Hungarians and Serbs. In the first half of the 18th century (1745) the Slovaks settled here. Since then Petrovac developed so that it represents cultural, economic, clerical and political center of the Slovaks in this region.

The first library was founded in Petrovac in 1845, and the first theater play was performed here in 1866. Slovak Gymnasium was established in Petrovac in 1919.

==Inhabited places==

Bački Petrovac municipality includes the town of Bački Petrovac and the following villages:
* Gložan ()
* Kulpin ()
* Maglić

Note: for the places with Slovak majority, the names are also given in Slovak.

==Demographics==

According to the 2022 census results, the municipality has 11,512 inhabitants.

===Ethnic groups===
The ethnic Slovaks form a majority of the population in the municipality. Settlements with Slovak majorities are: Bački Petrovac (Slovak: Báčsky Petrovec), Gložan (Slovak: Hložany), and Kulpin (Slovak: Kulpín). There is one settlement with a Serb majority: Maglić. The town is located in southern Bačka (hence the name), some 25 km northwest of Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina. It is the cultural center of Slovaks in the province, and other places in the eponymous municipalities are also inhabited by many Slovaks.

The ethnic composition of the municipality:
==Economy==
Agriculture is the most important economic activity based on the production of field crops (wheat, corn, broom weed, sugar beet, hop), cattle, breeding dud ponetry and vegetable crops. Besides agriculture there is also some industry manufacture, metal and chemical. Manufacture of wood civil engineering, printing activities, etc.

The following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):
== Cultural Monuments ==
The Slovak Evangelical Church in Bački Petrovac was errected in 1783, and enlarged and refurbished in 1822. Next to the church is a one-story parish house, with two rows of windows, decorated with plant and geometric motifs. The complex is protected as a cultural monument of great importance.

The oldest house in Bački Petrovac dates back from the late 18th century. It contains typical ethnographic objects from this area and is a part of the traditional architecture complex of the Museum of Vojvodina Slovaks.

<doc id="947217" wikidata="Q835591" url="?curid=947217" title="Varve">
<text>A varve is an annual layer of sediment or sedimentary rock.

The word &#x27;varve&#x27; derives from the Swedish word &quot;varv&quot; whose meanings and connotations include &#x27;revolution&#x27;, &#x27;in layers&#x27;, and &#x27;circle&#x27;.

Of the many rhythmites in the geological record, varves are one of the most important and illuminating in studies of past climate change. Varves are amongst the smallest-scale events recognised in stratigraphy.

An annual layer can be highly visible because the particles washed into the layer in the spring when there is greater flow strength are much coarser than those deposited later in the year. This forms a pair of layers—one coarse and one fine—for each annual cycle. Varves form only in fresh or brackish water, because the high levels of salt in normal sea water coagulate the clay into coarse grains. Since the saline waters leave coarse particles all year, it is nearly impossible to distinguish the individual layers in salt waters. Indeed, clay flocculation occurs at high ionic strength due to the collapse of the clay electrical double layer (EDL), which decreases the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged clay particles.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;varve&#x27; derives from the Swedish word &quot;varv&quot; whose meanings and connotations include &#x27;revolution&#x27;, &#x27;in layers&#x27;, and &#x27;circle&#x27;. The term first appeared as &quot;Hvarfig lera&quot; (varved clay) on the first map produced by the Geological Survey of Sweden in 1862.
Initially, &quot;varve&quot; referred to each of the separate components comprising a single annual layer in glacial lake sediments, but at the 1910 Geological Congress, the Swedish geologist Gerard De Geer (1858–1943) proposed a new formal definition, where varve means the whole of any annual sedimentary layer. More recently introduced terms such as &#x27;annually laminated&#x27; are synonymous with varve.

== History of varve research ==

Although the term varve was not introduced until the late nineteenth century, the concept of an annual rhythm of deposition is at least two centuries old. In the 1840s, Edward Hitchcock suspected laminated sediment in North America could be seasonal, and in 1884 Warren Upham postulated that light-dark laminated couplets represented a single year&#x27;s deposition. Despite these earlier forays, the chief pioneer and populariser of varve research was Gerard De Geer. While working for the Geological Survey of Sweden, De Geer noticed a close visual similarity between the laminated sediments he was mapping, and tree-rings. This prompted him to suggest the coarse-fine couplets frequently found in the sediments of glacial lakes were annual layers.

The first varve chronology was constructed by De Geer in Stockholm in the late 19th century. Further work soon followed, and a network of sites along the east coast of Sweden was established. The varved sediments exposed in these sites had formed in glaciolacustrine and glacimarine conditions in the Baltic basin as the last ice sheet retreated northwards. By 1914, De Geer had discovered that it was possible to compare varve sequences across long distances by matching variations in varve thickness, and distinct marker laminae. However, this discovery led De Geer and many of his co-workers into making incorrect correlations, which they called &#x27;teleconnections&#x27;, between continents, a process criticised by other varve pioneers like Ernst Antevs.

In 1924, the Geochronological Institute, a special laboratory dedicated to varve research was established. De Geer and his co-workers and students made trips to other countries and continents to investigate varved sediments. Ernst Antevs studied sites from Long Island, U.S.A. to Lake Timiskaming and Hudson Bay, Canada, and created a North American varve chronology. Carl Caldenius visited Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego, and Erik Norin visited central Asia. By this stage, other geologists were investigating varve sequences, including Matti Sauramo who constructed a varve chronology of the last deglaciation in Finland.

1940 saw the publication of a now classic scientific paper by De Geer, the &quot;Geochronologia Suecica&quot;, in which he presented the Swedish Time Scale, a floating varve chronology for ice recession from Skåne to Indalsälven. Ragnar Lidén made the first attempts to link this time scale with the present day. Since then, there have been revisions as new sites are discovered, and old ones reassessed. At present, the Swedish varve chronology is based on thousands of sites, and covers 13,200 varve years.

In 2008, although varves were considered likely to give similar information to dendrochronology, they were considered &quot;too uncertain&quot; for use on a long-term timescale. However, by 2012, “missing” varves in the Lake Suigetsu sequence were identified in the Lake Suigetsu 2006 Project by overlapping multiple cores and improved varve counting techniques, extending the timescale to 52,800 years.

==Formation==

Varves form in a variety of marine and lacustrine depositional environments from seasonal variation in clastic, biological, and chemical sedimentary processes.

The classic varve archetype is a light / dark coloured couplet deposited in a lake basin. During summer months, light laminae (thin layers) composed of silica and calcium carbonate are deposited. This is the consequence of dead phytoplankton, and other micro-organisms that create their skeletons or shells out of silica or calcium carbonate, falling to the lake bottom. This process of the precipitation and deposition of dead micro-organisms out of the water column is restricted to warm months when productivity (ecology) is high. The corresponding dark colored layers are composed of organic matter and fine sediment particles transported and deposited during spring freshets as a result of winter snowmelt. The alternation of these two distinct layers allows for high-precision dating of sediment profiles, for each couplet is equivalent to one year.

In addition to seasonal variation of sedimentary processes and deposition, varve formation requires the absence of bioturbation. Consequently, varves commonly form under anoxic conditions.

A well-known marine example of varved sediments are those found in the Santa Barbara basin, off California. Another long record of varved sediments is the palaeo-lacustrine record of the Piànico–Sèllere Basin (southern Alps). Here, the detrital layer part of each varve was used as a proxy for 771 palaeofloods which occurred over a period of 9.3 thousand years during an interglacial period in the Pleistocene.

<doc id="947219" wikidata="Q12384" url="?curid=947219" title="Donkey Kong (1981 video game)">
<text>is a 1981 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for arcades. As Mario (also sometimes known at the time as &quot;Jumpman&quot;), the player runs and jumps on platforms and climbs ladders to ascend a construction site and rescue Pauline from a giant gorilla, Donkey Kong. It is the first game in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series and Mario&#x27;s first appearance in a video game.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was created to salvage unsold arcade cabinets following the failure of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Radar Scope&quot; (1980), and was designed for Nintendo of America&#x27;s audience. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo&#x27;s president at the time, assigned the project to first-time video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing inspiration from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and 1930s American media such as &quot;Popeye&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;, Miyamoto developed the characters and scenario and designed the game alongside chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi. It was the most complex arcade game at that point, using graphics for characterization, including it and cutscenes to illustrate a plot, and integrating multiple unique stages into the gameplay. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; pioneered the platform game genre before the term existed, is the first to feature jumping, and is the one of the first video games with a damsel in distress narrative, after &quot;Sheriff&quot;. It had a limited release in Japan on July 9, 1981, before receiving a wide release some weeks later.

Although Nintendo of America&#x27;s staff was initially apprehensive, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; succeeded commercially and critically, becoming the highest-grossing game of 1981 and 1982. It was ported to the Game &amp; Watch, selling eight million units, while Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, a developer of arcade conversions for home consoles, selling six million cartridges. It was later ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), designed to replicate its technological capabilities; both the game and NES were integral in spreading Japanese video games to Western audiences. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;&#x27;s various ports sold more than 15 million units worldwide. Other companies cloned the game and avoided royalties altogether. Universal City Studios unsuccessfully sued Nintendo, alleging that &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; violated its trademark of the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot;&#x27;s success positioned Nintendo for market dominance for the 1980s and 1990s. The game debuts Mario, who became Nintendo&#x27;s mascot and one of the world&#x27;s most recognizable characters. It was mass marketed in multitudes of products, including breakfast cereal, toys, and television cartoons. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is considered one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade video games and one of the greatest and most popular arcade games of all time. It has been frequently referenced in pop culture and subsequent video games and has an active high score competition.

==Gameplay==
Following 1980&#x27;s &quot;Space Panic&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is one of the earliest examples of the platform game genre, even prior to the term being coined; the U.S. gaming press used &quot;climbing game&quot; for games with platforms and ladders. As the first platform game to feature jumping, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; requires the player to jump between gaps and over obstacles or approaching enemies whilst Donkey Kong throws barrels at the player, setting the template for the future of the genre. With four unique stages, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was the most complex arcade game of the time, and one of the first arcade games with multiple stages, following games such as 1980&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot; and 1981&#x27;s &quot;Gorf&quot; and &quot;Scramble&quot;.

In addition to the goal of saving Pauline, the player has a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses; removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage according to a steadily decreasing bonus counter. The player starts with three lives with a bonus life awarded at 7,000 points. A life is lost when Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far, or lets the bonus counter reach zero. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Each of the four single-screen stages represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed: 25, 50, 75, and 100 meters. Stage one involves Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage requires Mario to remove eight rivets from the platforms supporting Donkey Kong; this causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline. These four stages combine to form one level.

After each level, the stages repeat with increased difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs speed up. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level consists of five stages with the final stage at 125 meters. Level 130 is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to a programming error that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game. However, in January 2025, it was discovered that by using a TAS to exploit a glitch that allows the player to climb straight up to the top of the stage from the starting point (along with a considerable amount of luck), it is possible to continue the game until level 135.

===Competition===

The 2007 documentary &quot;The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters&quot; portrays Steve Wiebe&#x27;s attempts to break the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; world record, then considered to have been held by Billy Mitchell. In the early 2010s, Hank Chien set a record of 1,138,600 points. This was broken four years later by Robbie Lakeman with a score of 1,141,800. Lakeman&#x27;s record was then broken by John McCurdy on January 11, 2021, with a score of 1,272,700. Lakeman reclaimed the world record only five months later on June 8, scoring 100 more points than McCurdy. Making the new record 1,272,800.

In 2018, Mitchell was stripped of his records by Twin Galaxies and banned from submitting new scores after Twin Galaxies concluded that Mitchell had illicitly used emulators to achieve his scores. Twin Galaxies prohibits the use of emulators for high scores they publish because they allow undetectable cheating. In 2020 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; reversed its decision and reinstated Billy Mitchell&#x27;s previous world records, based on new evidence including eyewitness reports and expert testimonials.

There are other world record categories for &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; besides highest score. One of the most popular is the &quot;No Hammer Challenge&quot; where competitors try to get the highest score without using the hammer. The current world record in this category was set by Jeff Wolfe on July 8, 2008, with a score of 735,100. Some other categories include most points for different levels, and fewest points.

==Plot==
&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is considered to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. Set on a construction site in New York City, the eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; villain. The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. Donkey Kong kidnaps Mario&#x27;s girlfriend, originally known as Lady and later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that provided the template for countless video games released after.

The game uses graphics and animation for characterization. Donkey Kong smirks upon Mario&#x27;s demise. Pauline has a pink dress and long hair, and a speech balloon crying &quot;HELP!&quot;. Mario, depicted in red overalls and a red cap, is an everyman character, a type common in Japan. Graphical limitations and the low pixel resolution of the small sprites prompted his design. A mustache implies a mouth, a cap obviates the animation of hair, and colored overalls distinguish his arm movements. The artwork of the cabinets and promotional materials make these cartoon-like character designs even more explicit. Pauline, for example, is depicted as disheveled like the 1930s &quot;King Kong&quot;″s Fay Wray in a torn dress and stiletto heels.

Like &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980), &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; has cutscenes, but innovates by advancing a complete plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders to the top of a construction site, accompanied by a variation on the musical theme from &quot;Dragnet&quot;. He drops Pauline and stomps his feet, warping the steel beams. He moves to his final perch and sneers. A melody plays, and the level starts. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. At the stage, a heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs her and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays.

==Development==
Nintendo of America was founded in 1980 with minor success at importing its parent&#x27;s arcade cabinets from Japan. In early 1981, its president Minoru Arakawa bet the small startup company on a major order of 3,000 &quot;Radar Scope&quot;. Its poor reception in America filled a warehouse with 2,000 unsold &quot;Radar Scope&quot; machines, so Arakawa requested that the parent company president (and his father-in-law) Hiroshi Yamauchi send a conversion kit of new game software. Yamauchi polled the company&#x27;s entire talent pool for fresh game design concepts to save the distressed startup. This yielded Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s debut as lead game designer of his &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; concept, and Yamauchi appointed head engineer Gunpei Yokoi as project supervisor with a budget of according to Miyamoto.

Ikegami Tsushinki was subcontracted for some of the development, with no role in the game&#x27;s creation or concept, but to provide &quot;mechanical programming assistance to fix the software created by Nintendo&quot;. Nintendo instructed Ikegami to produce a program according to its instructions and put it onto read-only memory (ROM) chips on printed circuit boards (PC boards). This later led to mutual lawsuits in 1983, as Ikegami asserted ownership over &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; which Nintendo denied as Ikegami was a subcontractor who had already been paid. &quot;Game Machine&quot; called it &quot;simply a nuisance tactic&quot; on the part of Ikegami.

By late March 1981, Nintendo was also pursuing a license to make a game based on the &quot;Popeye&quot; comic strip. When this license attempt failed, Nintendo took the opportunity to create new characters that could be marketed and used in later games. Miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts, but he settled on a love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter with a large hammer, and a girlfriend, mirroring the rivalry between Bluto and Popeye for Olive Oyl. Bluto became an ape, which Miyamoto said was &quot;nothing too evil or repulsive&quot;. He would be the pet of the main character, &quot;a funny, hang-loose kind of guy&quot;. Miyamoto has named &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot; as influences. Although its origin as a comic strip license played a major part, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; marked the first time that the storyline for a video game preceded the game&#x27;s programming rather than simply being appended as an afterthought. An unrelated Popeye game was released by Nintendo for the Game &amp; Watch the following month, as well as a game called &quot;Popeye&quot; for arcades in 1982.

Yamauchi wanted primarily to target the North American market, so he mandated that the game be given an English title, as with many previous Nintendo games. Miyamoto decided to name the game for the ape, who he said was the strongest character. The story of how Miyamoto came up with the name &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; varies. A false urban myth says that the name was originally meant to be &quot;Monkey Kong&quot;, but was misspelled or misinterpreted due to a blurred fax or bad telephone connection. Another, more credible story claims Miyamoto looked in a Japanese-English dictionary for something that would mean &quot;stubborn gorilla&quot;, or that &quot;Donkey&quot; was meant to convey &quot;silly&quot; or &quot;stubborn&quot;; &quot;Kong&quot; was common Japanese slang for &quot;gorilla&quot;. A rival claim is that he worked with Nintendo&#x27;s export manager to come up with the title, and that &quot;Donkey&quot; was meant to represent &quot;stupid and goofy&quot;. In 2001, Miyamoto stated that he thought the name would convey the thought of a &quot;stupid ape&quot;.

Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project. He was not a programmer, so instead consulted technicians for concept feasibility. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, and have different movements and reactions. Yokoi thought Miyamoto&#x27;s original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen which was eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept came later in the &quot;Popeye&quot; arcade game. Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels, and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to implement the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto&#x27;s design, creating a total of approximately 20 kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.

The circuit board of &quot;Radar Scope&quot; was restructured for &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The &quot;Radar Scope&quot; hardware, originally inspired by the Namco &quot;Galaxian&quot; hardware, was designed for a large number of enemies moving around at high speeds, which &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; does not require, so the development team removed unnecessary functions and reduced the scale of the circuit board. The gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, and the existing CPU, sound hardware, and monitor were left intact. The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display, and font are almost identical to &quot;Radar Scope&quot;, with palette differences. The &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; hardware has the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects use single sprites, the taller Pauline uses two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong uses six sprites.

Hiroshi Yamauchi thought the game was going to sell well and phoned to inform Arakawa. Nintendo of America&#x27;s distributors, Ron Judy and Al Stone, brought Arakawa to the lawyer Howard Lincoln to secure a trademark.

The game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing. The sales manager disliked it for being too different from the maze and shooter games common at the time, and Judy and Lincoln expressed reservations over the strange title. Still, Arakawa adamantly believed that it would be a hit. American staff began translating the storyline for the cabinet art and naming the characters. They chose &quot;Pauline&quot; for the Lady, after Polly James, wife of Nintendo&#x27;s warehouse manager Don James. Arakawa suggested that the name of &quot;Jumpman&quot;, a name originally chosen for its similarity to the popular brands Walkman and &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, be changed to &quot;Mario&quot; after Mario Segale, the landlord of the original office space of Nintendo of America. These character names were used in promotional materials, although Mario was called Jumpman in the operations manual and instructions. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was ready for release.

Stone and Judy convinced the managers of two bars in Seattle, Washington, to set up &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, but when they saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a solid week, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips, and Stone gutted 2,000 surplus &quot;Radar Scope&quot; machines and applied the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; conversion kits imported from Japan, consisting of motherboards, power supplies, and marquee graphics. The game officially went on sale in July 1981.

==Ports==
=== Coleco ===
Makers of video game consoles were interested. Taito offered a considerable fee for all rights to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, but Nintendo declined after three days of internal discussion. Rivals Coleco and Atari, Inc. approached Nintendo in Japan and the United States respectively. In the end, Yamauchi granted Coleco exclusive console and tabletop rights to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; because he believed that &quot;it [was] the hungriest company&quot;. In addition, Arakawa believed that as a more established company in the U.S., Coleco could better handle marketing. In return, Nintendo received an undisclosed lump sum plus $1.40 per game cartridge sold and $1 per tabletop unit. On December 24, 1981, Howard Lincoln drafted the contract. He included language that Coleco would be held liable for anything on the game cartridge, an unusual clause for a licensing agreement. Arakawa signed the document the next day, and, on February 1, 1982, Yamauchi persuaded the Coleco representative in Japan to sign without review by the company&#x27;s lawyers.

Coleco bundled the game with the ColecoVision console, which went on sale in August 1982, though the individual cartridge was also available in stores. Coleco offered Atari 2600 and Intellivision versions as well. Coleco&#x27;s Atari 2600 port was programmed by Garry Kitchen. Kitchen was contracted to port the game through his brother Steve, who had connections to an executive at Coleco. He was given only three or four months to develop the port and worked without sleep for the last 72 hours before shipping. Kitchen received no assistance from Nintendo and minimal aid from Coleco, who only provided him with an arcade machine for temporary use. These factors combined with the limited memory of Atari 2600 cartridges forced him to omit two of the original game&#x27;s four levels. Coleco&#x27;s sales subsequently doubled to $500 million and its earnings quadrupled to $40 million. Coleco also released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabletop versions of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, and &quot;Frogger&quot; in 1982. Coleco also bundled a copy of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; with its Atari VCS clone, the Coleco Gemini, in 1983.

=== Atari ===
Atari obtained the license for home computer versions of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and released it for the Atari 8-bit computers. When Coleco unveiled the Adam Computer, running a port of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; at the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois, Atari protested that it was in violation of the licensing agreement. Yamauchi demanded that Arnold Greenberg, Coleco&#x27;s president, withdraw his Adam port. Greenberg complied, and the game was not published.

The Atari 8-bit conversion of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; contains one of the longest-undiscovered &quot;Easter eggs&quot; in a video game. Programmer Landon Dyer&#x27;s initials appear if the player dies under certain conditions and returns to the title screen. This remained undiscovered for 26 years until Dyer revealed it on his blog, stating that &quot;there&#x27;s an Easter egg, but it&#x27;s totally not worth it, and I don&#x27;t remember how to bring it up anyway&quot;. The steps required to trigger it were later discovered by Don Hodges, who used an emulator and a debugger to trace through the game&#x27;s code.

===Famicom/NES===

The game was ported by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 2 to Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer (Famicom) console and released in Japan on July 15, 1983, as one of the system&#x27;s three launch games. Masayuki Uemura, the Famicom&#x27;s lead architect, designed the console specifically to faithfully recreate &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. It is an early Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game in the &quot;Arcade Classics Series&quot;, released in June 1986 in North America and October 15 in Europe. Omitted are the cement factory stage and most of the cutscenes, because early ROM cartridges do not have enough memory. It includes a new song composed by Yukio Kaneoka for the title screen. Both &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, are included in the 1988 NES compilation &quot;Donkey Kong Classics&quot;.

A complete remake of the original arcade game on the Game Boy, titled &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (referred to as &quot;Donkey Kong &#x27;94&quot; during development) contains levels from both the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; arcades. It starts with the same gameplay and four locations as the arcade game and then progresses to 97 additional puzzle-based levels. It is the first game to have built-in enhancement for the Super Game Boy system.

==Reception==
Upon release in arcades, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; compared it favorably with &quot;King Kong&quot; and predicted that it would likely become a success. In his 1982 book &quot;Video Invaders&quot;, Steve Bloom described &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as &quot;another bizarre cartoon game, courtesy of Japan&quot; and said it was one of the &quot;most exciting variations&quot; on &quot;Pac-Man&quot;″s maze theme along with Sega&#x27;s &quot;Frogger&quot; due to how players need to &quot;scale from the bottom of the screen to the top&quot; which make them &quot;more like obstacle courses than mazes&quot; since &quot;you always know where you&#x27;re going — up&quot;. In January 1983, the 1982 Arcade Awards gave it the award for the best single-player video game and the Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year.

In September 1982, &quot;Arcade Express&quot; reviewed the ColecoVision port and scored it 9 out of 10. &quot;Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games&quot; in 1983 stated that &quot;Coleco did a fabulous job&quot; with &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, the best of the console&#x27;s first five games and &quot;the most faithful adaptation of the original video game I have seen&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Danny Goodman stated that of Coleco&#x27;s three console versions, the one for the ColecoVision was the best, followed by Atari and Intellivision. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the ColecoVision port in its September 1984 issue and scored it 4 out of 4 in all four categories of Action, Graphics, Addiction and Theme. Ed Driscoll reviewed the Atari VCS version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 59. Edwards commented that the game is near perfect and that anyone can be caught in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; &quot;fever&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was popular worldwide, garnering a positive reaction from consumers, and was a significant commercial success for Nintendo, pulling them out of financial troubles. After the game&#x27;s initial 2,000 arcade cabinets sold out, more orders were made. Arakawa began manufacturing the electronic components in Redmond because waiting for shipments from Japan was taking too long. The game&#x27;s success led to Arakawa expanding Nintendo of America. By October, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was selling 4,000 units a month, and by June 1982, Nintendo had sold 60,000 &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; machines in the United States, earning $180 million. Judy and Stone, who worked on straight commission, became millionaires. Arakawa used Nintendo&#x27;s profits to buy of land in Redmond in July 1982. Nintendo earned another $100 million on the game in its second year of release in America, totaling $280 million in US cabinet sales by 1982 ().

In Japan, the annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; charts listed &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1981, and then the sixth highest-grossing arcade game of 1982, with &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listing the game in its October 1, 1983, issue as the twentieth most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. In the United States, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; topped the &quot;Play Meter&quot; arcade charts in October 1981, setting a weekly earnings record, and it was later listed by &quot;RePlay&quot; as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1982. It was also among the thirteen highest-grossing arcade games of 1983 in the United States. According to &quot;Electronic Games&quot; in June 1983, the home versions contributed to the arcade version&#x27;s extended popularity, compared to the four to six months that the average game lasted. It remained Nintendo&#x27;s top seller into mid-1983, with steady sales in Japan. A total of 65,000 arcade units were sold in Japan, and 67,000 arcade units in the United States, for a total of arcade units sold in Japan and the United States.

Nintendo&#x27;s Game &amp; Watch handheld version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; released in 1982 sold 8 million units. Coleco had sold 6 million &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; cartridges for home consoles, grossing more than and earning Nintendo more than in royalties; the bundled ColecoVision version sold 2 million units, while the Atari 2600 version sold 4 million units in 1982 for , making it one of the best-selling Atari 2600 games. It was also one of the earliest cartridges available for video game rental at certain stores in 1982. Atari&#x27;s 1987 re-release for the Atari 2600 sold a further units for by 1990. Coleco&#x27;s Mini-Arcade tabletop versions of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Galaxian&quot;, and &quot;Frogger&quot;, had combined sales of three million units. In Japan, 840,000 units of the Famicom version were sold; the &quot;Famicom Mini&quot; version for the Game Boy Advance later had a further 160,000 units sold, for a total of 1 million units sold in Japan. The Atari 8-bit computer version sold units in 1986 and 1990. This totals units sold worldwide for the Game &amp; Watch, ColecoVision, Atari and Famicom ports. , all versions of the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; are estimated to have grossed in revenue.

==Legal issues==
In April 1982, Sid Sheinberg, a lawyer and the president of MCA and Universal City Studios, learned of the game&#x27;s success and suspected it might be a trademark infringement of Universal&#x27;s own &quot;King Kong&quot;. Nintendo was given 48 hours to turn over all profits from the game and dispose of all &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; inventory. On April 27, he met with Arnold Greenberg of Coleco and threatened to sue over Coleco&#x27;s home version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Coleco agreed on May 3 to pay royalties to Universal of 3% of their &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;″s net sale price, worth about $4.6 million. Meanwhile, Sheinberg revoked Tiger&#x27;s license to make its &quot;King Kong&quot; game, but O. R. Rissman refused to acknowledge Universal&#x27;s claim to the trademark. When Universal threatened Nintendo, Howard Lincoln and Nintendo refused to cave. In preparation for the court battle, Universal agreed to allow Tiger to continue producing its &quot;King Kong&quot; game as long as they distinguished it from &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

Universal sued Nintendo on June 29 and announced its license with Coleco. The company sent cease and desist letters to Nintendo&#x27;s licensees, all of which agreed to pay royalties to Universal except Milton Bradley and Ralston Purina. &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo, Co., Ltd.&quot; was heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Robert W. Sweet. Over seven days, Universal&#x27;s counsel, the New York firm Townley &amp; Updike, argued that the names &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; were easily confused and that the plot of the game was an infringement on that of the films. Nintendo&#x27;s counsel, John Kirby, countered that Universal had argued in a previous case that &quot;King Kong&quot;″s scenario and characters were in the public domain (by way of the Novelization of the 1933 film). Judge Sweet ruled in Nintendo&#x27;s favor, awarding them Universal&#x27;s profits from Tiger&#x27;s game ($56,689.41), damages and attorney&#x27;s fees.

Universal appealed, trying to prove consumer confusion by presenting the results of a telephone survey and examples from print media where people had allegedly assumed a connection between the two Kongs. On October 4, 1984, the court upheld the previous verdict. Nintendo and its licensees filed counterclaims against Universal. On May 20, 1985, Judge Sweet awarded Nintendo $1.8 million for legal fees, lost revenues, and other expenses, but he denied Nintendo&#x27;s claim of damages from those licensees who had paid royalties to both Nintendo and Universal. Both parties appealed this judgment, but the verdict was upheld on July 15, 1986.

Nintendo thanked John Kirby with the gift of a $30,000 sailboat named &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and &quot;exclusive worldwide rights to use the name for sailboats&quot;. Kirby, the protagonist of the Kirby series, was named in John Kirby&#x27;s honor. The court battle also taught Nintendo they could compete with larger entertainment industry companies.

After the release of &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, the arcade successor to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Ikegami sued Nintendo for the unauthorized duplication of the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; program code. Nintendo managed to settle the dispute out of court after the two companies came to an agreement. At the time of the suit, computer programs were not considered copyrightable material. The Tokyo High Court gave a verdict in 1989 that acknowledged the originality of program code. Ikegami and Nintendo reached a settlement the following year; the terms of it were never disclosed.

==Legacy==
In 1996 &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the arcade, Atari 7800, and cancelled Coleco Adam versions as number 50 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that even ignoring its massive historical significance, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; stands as a great game due to its demanding challenges and graphics which manage to elegantly delineate an entire scenario on a single screen. In February 2006, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; rated it the 148th best game made on a Nintendo system. In 2017, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame. Today, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; is the fifth most popular arcade game among collectors.

===Impact===
&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; spawned a number of other titles with a mix of running, jumping and vertical traversal, a novel genre that did not match the style of games that came before it. The genre was initially referred to as &quot;Donkey Kong-type&quot; or &quot;Kong-style&quot; games, before the genre eventually came to be known as platform games. The game was also a milestone in terms of video game storytelling and cutscenes. While there were earlier games that either told a story or used cutscenes, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; combined both concepts together to introduce its own new concept: using cutscenes to visually advance a complete story. It also notably had multiple, distinct levels that progressed the storyline.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was also one of the first Japanese games brought to Western regions that introduced a surreal concept using cute artwork, a representation of typical Japanese fantasy but unusual to Western audiences. For that reason, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and similar games that followed were briefly called &quot;novelty games&quot; by Western gaming press. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; and other such games helped to acclimate Western audiences to Japanese approaches to game design, narrative, and abstraction that would become key elements in the decade that followed with the release of the NES.

&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; &quot;the most momentous&quot; release of 1981, as it &quot;introduced three important names&quot; to the global video game industry: Nintendo, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Mario. These three figures went on to play a significant role in video game history. &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; paved the way for the NES, known as the Famicom in Japan. Following the success of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Nintendo began developing the Famicom, the hardware of which was largely based on the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade hardware, with the goal of matching the system&#x27;s powerful sprite capabilities in a home system. Nintendo wanted the Famicom to match the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade hardware, so they took a &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade cabinet to semiconductor chip manufacturer Ricoh for analysis, which led to Ricoh producing the Picture Processing Unit (PPU) chip for the NES.

===Emulation===
The NES version was re-released as an unlockable game in the first &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;, both through its Nintendo Space World 2000 demo as well as the final game. It was also published on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2006 worldwide with a South Korean release in 2008, the Wii U in 2013, and the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2012, North America and Europe in 2013, and in South Korea in 2016. The Wii U version is also the last game that was released to celebrate the 30-year anniversary of the Japanese version of the NES, the Famicom. The original arcade version of the game appears in the Nintendo 64 game &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, and it must be beaten to finish the game. Nintendo released the NES version on the e-Reader in 2002, and for the Game Boy Advance as part of the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; in 2004. In 2004, Namco released an arcade cabinet which contains &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;, and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;

&quot;Donkey Kong: Original Edition&quot; is an update of the NES version that reinstates the cement factory stage and includes some animations absent from the original NES version, and has only ever been released on the Virtual Console. It was preinstalled on 25th Anniversary PAL region red Wii systems, which were first released in Europe on October 29, 2010. In Japan, a download code for the game for the 3DS Virtual Console was sent to users who purchased &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; or &quot;Brain Age: Concentration Training&quot; from the Nintendo eShop from July 28 to September 2, 2012. In North America, a download code for &quot;Original Edition&quot; for the 3DS Virtual Console was sent to users who purchased one of five select 3DS games on the Nintendo eShop and registered it on Club Nintendo from October 1, 2012, to January 6, 2013. In Europe and Australia, it was released for purchase on the Nintendo 3DS eShop in September 2014. The original arcade version was re-released as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series for Nintendo Switch on June 14, 2018, and the NES version was re-released as one of the launch titles for Nintendo Switch Online on September 19.

===Clones===
&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; was one of the most widely cloned video games in the early 1980s, along with &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). By 1983, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; clones had become available on various different platforms. &quot;The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers&quot; lists 17 different &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; clones released for various home platforms. There were so many games with multiple ladder and platforms stages by 1983 that &quot;Electronic Games&quot; described Nintendo&#x27;s own &quot;Popeye&quot; game as &quot;yet another variation of a theme that&#x27;s become all too familiar since the success of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;&quot;. That year Sega released a &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; clone called &quot;Congo Bongo&quot; in arcades. Although using isometric perspective, the structure and gameplay are similar.

&quot;Crazy Kong&quot; was officially licensed from Nintendo and manufactured by Falcon for some non-US markets. Nevertheless, &quot;Crazy Kong&quot; machines found their way into some American arcades, often installed in cabinets marked as &quot;Congorilla&quot;. Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing the game in the US. Bootleg copies of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; also appeared in both North America and France under the &quot;Crazy Kong&quot;, &quot;Konkey Kong&quot; or &quot;Donkey King&quot; names. The 1982 &quot;Logger&quot; arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.

In 1981, O. R. Rissman, president of Tiger Electronics, obtained a license to use the name &quot;King Kong&quot; from Universal City Studios. Under this title, Tiger created a handheld LCD game with a scenario and gameplay based directly on Nintendo&#x27;s creation. Epyx&#x27;s &quot;Jumpman&quot; (Atari 8-bit, 1983) reuses a prototypical name for the Mario character in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. A magazine ad for the game has the tagline &quot;If you liked &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, you&#x27;ll love &quot;JUMPMAN&quot;!&quot; &quot;Jumpman&quot;, &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; (Atari 8-bit, 1982), and &quot;Mr. Robot and His Robot Factory&quot; (Atari 8-bit, 1984), focus on traversing all of the platforms in the level, or collecting scattered objects, instead of climbing to the top.

Many home computer clones directly borrowed the gorilla theme: &quot;Killer Gorilla&quot; (BBC Micro, 1983), &quot;Killer Kong&quot; (ZX Spectrum, 1983), &quot;Crazy Kong 64&quot; (Commodore 64, 1983), &quot;Kongo Kong&quot; (Commodore 64, 1983), &quot;Donkey King&quot; (TRS-80 Color Computer, 1983), and &quot;Kong&quot; (TI-99/4A, 1983). One of the first releases from Electronic Arts was &quot;Hard Hat Mack&quot; (Apple II, 1983), a three-stage game without an ape, but using the construction site setting from &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Other clones recast the game with different characters, such as &quot;Cannonball Blitz&quot; (Apple II, 1982), with a soldier and cannonballs replacing the ape and barrels, and the American Southwest-themed &quot;Canyon Climber&quot; (Atari 8-bit, 1982).

Nintendo attempted to take legal action against unauthorized clones of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, but estimated they lost in potential sales to these clones. By 1990, Nintendo had successfully won over thirty lawsuits related to &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. For example, Nintendo won a 1990 Japanese lawsuit against Falcon Company, which had sold 12,000 counterfeit arcade cabinets in the United States during the 1980s.

===Franchise===

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; spawned a franchise, beginning with the sequel &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; (1982) with the player controlling Donkey Kong&#x27;s son in an attempt to save his father from Mario. The spin-off &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (1983) introduced Mario&#x27;s brother Luigi in a single-screen cooperative game, set in a sewer, and launched the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. The final arcade installment, &quot;Donkey Kong 3&quot; (1983), appeared in the form of a fixed shooter, with an exterminator named Stanley ridding the ape—and insects—from a greenhouse.

Nintendo revived the franchise in the 1990s for a series of platform games and spin-offs developed by Rare, beginning with &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; in 1994. &quot;Donkey Kong Racing&quot; for the GameCube was in development by Rare, but was canceled when Microsoft purchased the company. The &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series was revived by Retro Studios in 2010 with the release of &quot;Donkey Kong Country Returns&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&quot;, in 2014.

In 2004, Nintendo released &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot;, a sequel to the Game Boy&#x27;s &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, in which Mario must chase Donkey Kong to get back the stolen Mini-Mario toys; &quot;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&quot; has since continued as its own series. In 2004, Nintendo released the first of the &quot;Donkey Konga&quot; games, a rhythm-based game series that uses a special bongo controller. &quot;Donkey Kong Jungle Beat&quot; (2005) is a unique platform action game that uses the same bongo controller accessory. In 2007, &quot;Donkey Kong Barrel Blast&quot; was released for the Wii. It was originally developed as a GameCube game and would have used the bongo controller, but was delayed and released exclusively as a Wii game with no support for the bongo accessory.

&quot;Donkey Kong&quot; appears as a game in the Wii U game &quot;NES Remix&quot;, which features multiple NES games and sometimes &quot;remixes&quot; them by presenting significantly modified versions of the games as challenges. One such challenge features Link from &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; traveling through the first screen to save Pauline. The difficulty is increased compared to the original &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; because Link cannot jump, as in &quot;Zelda&quot;. &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; include a demo of the NES version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. A stage called &quot;75m&quot;, a replica of its Donkey Kong namesake, has appeared in the &quot;Smash&quot; series since &quot;Brawl&quot;.

===In popular culture===
By June 1982, &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;″s success had prompted more than 50 parties in the U.S. and Japan to license the game&#x27;s characters. Mario and Donkey Kong appeared on cereal boxes, board games, pajamas, and manga. Several animated commercials were produced by FilmFair Studio for the cereal, featuring Larry Moran as Mario, Jo Belle Yonely as Pauline, and William Marshall as the narrator. In 1983, the animation studio Ruby-Spears produced a &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; cartoon (as well as &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot;) for the &quot;Saturday Supercade&quot; program on CBS. In the show, mystery crime-solving plots in the mode of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; are framed around the premise of Mario and Pauline chasing Donkey Kong (voiced by Soupy Sales), who has escaped from the circus. The show lasted two seasons.

The game has also been referenced and discussed in several films and documentaries. The 2007 documentary &quot;The King of Kong&quot; follows the efforts of Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell to break the world record for high scores in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. The documentary inspired Hank Chien to start playing the game for fun; he became the new world champion on February 26, 2010. The game&#x27;s creation and lawsuit with Universal were discussed in the second episode of &quot;High Score&quot; on Netflix, which also featured an interview with John Kirby (who the episode was dedicated to as he died shortly before its release).

In the 2015 film &quot;Pixels&quot;, a film where aliens take on the form of 1980s arcade characters as they attack Earth, the alien leader takes on the form of Donkey Kong in the film&#x27;s climax. In the 2023 &quot;Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, Charles Martinet (Mario&#x27;s voice actor in the video games), makes a cameo appearance as Giuseppe, who resembles how Mario looked back in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. Giuseppe is also seen playing &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; on an arcade cabinet, but in the film the game is called &quot;Jump Man&quot;, referencing Mario&#x27;s original name.

In 1982, the songs &quot;Do the Donkey Kong&quot; by Buckner &amp; Garcia and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; by R. Cade and the Video Victims were released. Artists like DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince and Trace Adkins referenced the game in songs. Episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;, and &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; have referenced the game. Sound effects from the Atari 2600 version serve as generic video game sounds in films and television series. The phrase &quot;It&#x27;s on like Donkey Kong&quot; was coined by American rapper Ice Cube in 1992, and has been used in various works of popular culture. In November 2010, Nintendo applied for a trademark on the phrase with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

&quot;Fallout 4&quot; features a holotape game called Red Menace that is inspired by Donkey Kong&#x27;s levels. The game can be found in Vault 111 and played on the player&#x27;s Pip-Boy.

<text>Skydiggers is a Canadian roots rock band from Toronto formed by Andy Maize and Josh Finlayson. Since 1990, they have released 19 albums/EPs and have had a number of singles that have appeared on the Canadian charts. Their most successful album is &quot;Restless&quot;, released in 1992. With a presence spanning decades, the band has appeared under a variety of different record labels and with many changes in members that form the group.

==Biography==
The band was originally formed by singer Andy Maize, previously of Direktive 17, and lead guitarist Josh Finlayson, formerly of The Ramblers, as a duo called West Montrose. The band later added rhythm guitarist and singer-songwriter Peter Cash, drummer Wayne Stokes and bassist Ron Macey to their lineup after becoming regular performers at Acoustic Meltdown, a weekly concert series at Toronto&#x27;s Spadina Hotel organized by Cash&#x27;s brother, singer-songwriter Andrew Cash. The expanded line up settled on the name Skydiggers, a name which Andrew Cash had previously considered for his own band.

In 1989, the band became the first Canadian signing to Enigma Records, who released their self-titled debut album the following year. It spawned the singles &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;I Will Give You Everything&quot;. However, the label soon went bankrupt, and the album was never properly promoted.

Some of Enigma&#x27;s Canadian staff created FRE Records in 1992, and released the band&#x27;s second (and most popular) album, &quot;Restless&quot;, that year. At the same time, Stokes left the band. Drummers Mike Sloski and Steve Pitkin filled in on drums until the band recruited Joel Anderson as its new permanent drummer. &quot;A Penny More&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Restless&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, produced by John Oliveira and the band at Hamilton&#x27;s Grant Avenue Studios.

Capitol Records, the distributor for both Enigma and FRE, also rereleased the band&#x27;s debut album that year.

In 1993, the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Just Over This Mountain&quot;, was released. It consolidated the band&#x27;s status by winning a number of music awards, including the Juno Award for Most Promising Group. Following that album, Anderson left the band and was replaced by Peter von Althen.

In 1995, the band signed to Warner Canada and released &quot;Road Radio&quot;. However, at this time, FRE went bankrupt, meaning that the band&#x27;s earlier albums were no longer widely available. After the tour to support that album, Cash left the band. He was replaced by Paul MacLeod. The band subsequently left Warner, after which von Althen also left the band.

Since the band&#x27;s sound had largely been defined by Maize and Cash&#x27;s vocal harmonies, the band revised their sound somewhat for 1997&#x27;s &quot;Desmond&#x27;s Hip City&quot;, released on DROG Records. The title track had an almost trip hop feel, and some other songs (notably &quot;November in Ontario&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;) were closer to hard rock than anything the band had previously recorded.

In 1999, the band performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto. With &quot;Restless&quot;, their most popular album, still unavailable in stores due to legal uncertainties around FRE&#x27;s bankruptcy, they decided that their next studio project would be to assemble a new version of that album using old rehearsal recordings. &quot;Still Restless: The Lost Tapes&quot; was released that year.

In 2000, the band released the live album &quot;There and Back Again&quot;, followed in 2003 by &quot;Bittersweet Harmony&quot;.

In 2006, they teamed up with The Cash Brothers (former Skydigger Peter Cash and his brother Andrew) to release, &quot;Skydiggers/Cash Brothers&quot;, an acoustic album. In 2008 they released &quot;City of Sirens&quot;, followed by the compilation&quot;The Truth About Us&quot; in 2009.

The band returned in 2012 when they released &quot;Northern Shore&quot; through MapleMusic Recordings. In 2013, the band released &quot;No. 1 Northern&quot;, an album of cover versions of songs by Canadian songwriters, including Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot, Ron Sexsmith, Gene MacLellan, Linda McRae, Charlie Angus and Andrew Cash. They also released the album &quot;She Comes Into The Room&quot;.

In 2013, the band released the five-track EP &quot;Angels&quot; for the holiday season. A year later, this was expanded to 11 songs and released as a full album. The band are currently signed to Latent Recordings.

On January 1, 2017, Skydiggers were part of CBC&#x27;s The Strombo Show&#x27;s Hip 30, where Canadian bands covered songs from The Tragically Hip to commemorate the Hip&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The band covered the song &quot;The Depression Suite: The Rock&quot;. 2017 also saw the release of the Skydiggers latest LP &quot;Warmth of the Sun&quot;.

The band is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

==Finlayson/Maize==
Josh Finlayson and Andy Maize of the Skydiggers have collaborated on a side project of their own named Finlayson/Maize. The duo released their album &quot;Dark Hollow&quot; under the project name.

<text>The Poker Hall of Fame is the hall of fame of professional poker in the United States. Founded in Las Vegas, it was created in 1979 by Benny Binion, the owner of the Horseshoe Casino, to preserve the names and legacies of the world&#x27;s greatest poker players and to serve as a tourist attraction to his casino.

Binion was known for the creative ways in which he marketed his casino. In 1949, he convinced Johnny Moss and Nick &quot;The Greek&quot; Dandolos to play high-stakes poker heads up where the public could watch them. In 1970, he invited a group of poker players to compete in what would be the first World Series of Poker (WSOP). When Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment, later known as Caesars Entertainment, acquired the rights to the WSOP in 2004, it also assumed ownership of the Poker Hall of Fame. Currently, membership in the Poker Hall of Fame is handled directly by the WSOP.

As of 2024, 61 people have been inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame, 30 of whom are still living.

In July 2023, an exhibit devoted to the Poker Hall of Fame opened in the Horseshoe Las Vegas, owned by Caesar’s Entertainment. The exhibit acknowledges poker’s most legendary players with a Gallery of Champions, WSOP bracelets and rings.

== Requirements ==
Before the 2009 World Series of Poker, then-WSOP Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack announced that the process for becoming a member into the Poker Hall of Fame would undergo a slight modification. Starting in 2009, the Poker Hall of Fame started accepting nominations from the public. This move was intended to increase interest in the Hall. Almost immediately after this decision was announced, Party Poker started an online campaign to get its representative and World Poker Tour commentator Mike Sexton elected to the Hall. Other poker sites, namely PokerStars&#x27; Tom McEvoy, followed suit by pushing their own poker professionals. The requirements for the Poker Hall of Fame are as follows:
*&quot;A gambler must have played poker against acknowledged top competition,&quot;
*&quot;Played for high stakes,&quot;
*&quot;Played consistently well, gained the respect of peers,&quot;
*&quot;And stood the test of time.&quot;
*&quot;Or, for non-players, contributed to the overall growth and success of the game of poker, with indelible positive and lasting results.&quot;

In 2009, 23-year-old online poker professional Tom Dwan was a finalist for the Poker Hall of Fame because of public balloting. As a result, a new age requirement was added in 2011. This rule, known as the &quot;Chip Reese Rule&quot;, established a minimum age of 40 to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. This new requirement eliminated some players who were regular nominees over the previous years, such as Phil Ivey and Daniel Negreanu (both of whom were eventually inducted upon reaching the age threshold).

==The award==
Admission into the Poker Hall of Fame is considered one of the greatest honors in poker. In his acceptance speech, T. J. Cloutier declared, &quot;It&#x27;s one of two things I&#x27;ve always wanted to win.&quot; Barbara Enright, the first woman inducted into the Hall, considers her induction to be a &quot;lifetime achievement honor.&quot;

Before being acquired by Harrah&#x27;s Casino, R.S. Owens &amp; Company was commissioned to design an award for Poker Hall of Famers. The award was an eight-inch-tall piece of glass with a hand of cards sandblasted at the bottom, the winner&#x27;s name, and the words &quot;Poker Hall of Fame&quot; in a circle. The circle had a gold emblem bonded to the glass and had the Binion&#x27;s Horseshoe Casino logo in it. There was a gold plated base with three gold-plated stacks of chips.

<text>In mathematics, particularly the study of Lie groups, a Dunkl operator is a certain kind of mathematical operator, involving differential operators but also reflections in an underlying space.

Formally, let &quot;G&quot; be a Coxeter group with reduced root system &quot;R&quot; and &quot;k&quot;&quot;v&quot; an arbitrary &quot;multiplicity&quot; function on &quot;R&quot; (so &quot;k&quot;&quot;u&quot; = &quot;k&quot;&quot;v&quot; whenever the reflections σ&quot;u&quot; and σ&quot;v&quot; corresponding to the roots &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are conjugate in &quot;G&quot;). Then, the Dunkl operator is defined by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the &quot;i&quot;-th component of &quot;v&quot;, 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;N&quot;, &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot;&quot;N&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; a smooth function on &quot;R&quot;&quot;N&quot;.

Dunkl operators were introduced by . One of Dunkl&#x27;s major results was that Dunkl operators &quot;commute,&quot; that is, they satisfy formula_3 just as partial derivatives do. Thus Dunkl operators represent a meaningful generalization of partial derivatives.

<text>FRE Records, a.k.a. Flood Ross Entertainment, Inc., was a Mississauga, Ontario based independent record label in the 1990s. It was originally formed by former employees Terry Flood and Derrick Ross of Enigma Records after that label&#x27;s Canadian operations folded.

The best-known bands on FRE were April Wine and Skydiggers.

In 1996, FRE filed for bankruptcy, and many of the records that had been released on the label, including Skydiggers&#x27; &quot;Restless&quot; (one of the bestselling Canadian indie records of the 1990s), ceased to be available in record stores.

In 1999, the Skydiggers recorded a new version of &quot;Restless&quot;, titled &quot;Still Restless: The Lost Tapes&quot;, since they still could not obtain their original master tapes from the label.

<doc id="947243" wikidata="Q2746497" url="?curid=947243" title="Hurricane Frances">
<text>Hurricane Frances was the second most intense tropical cyclone in the Atlantic during 2004 and proved to be very destructive in Florida. It was the sixth named storm, the fourth hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The system crossed the open Atlantic in late August, moving to the north of the Lesser Antilles while strengthening. Its outer bands struck Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands while passing north of the Caribbean Sea. The storm&#x27;s maximum sustained winds peaked at , achieving Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the system&#x27;s forward motion slowed, the eye passed over San Salvador Island and very close to Cat Island in the Bahamas. Frances was the first hurricane to impact the entire Bahamian archipelago since 1928 and almost completely destroyed their agricultural economy.

Frances then passed over the central sections of Florida, three weeks after Hurricane Charley, causing significant damage to the state&#x27;s citrus crop, closing major airports and schools, and forcing the cancellation of a collegiate football game. The storm then moved briefly offshore from Florida, into the northeast Gulf of Mexico, and made a second U.S. landfall, on the Florida Panhandle, before accelerating northeast through the eastern United States near the Appalachians and into Atlantic Canada while weakening. A significant tornado outbreak accompanied the storm across the eastern United States, nearly equaling the outbreak from Hurricane Beulah. Very heavy rains fell in association with this slow-moving and relatively large hurricane, which caused floods in Florida and North Carolina. 50 people died and damages totaled US$10.1 billion (2004 dollars).

==Meteorological history==

A strong tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on August 21. Moving under the base of the subtropical ridge, it moved westward for several days, remaining disorganized despite favorable conditions. Thunderstorms associated with the wave finally began organizing on August 24 and the system became a tropical depression early the next day. Good upper-level outflow was observed in all but the eastern quadrants as the depression continued on its path, and it strengthened to tropical storm status on August 25, approximately east of the Lesser Antilles.

The tropical storm, now named Frances, further intensified on August 26 in an environment of low vertical wind shear as its track bent to the west-northwest. Frances rapidly intensified, developing an eye and reaching hurricane strength late that afternoon. An approaching upper-level trough caused Frances to move more northwesterly on August 27. The cyclone reached its primary peak intensity of on August 28. The hurricane turned back to its original westward motion on August 29, as the upper trough moved away the region and the subtropical ridge strengthened to Frances&#x27;s north.
Over the next day, the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle, during which the maximum sustained winds decreased to . This weakening trend was short lived, and the storm reintensified during the afternoon of August 30, as vertical wind shear remained low. The storm continued strengthening as it turned west-northwestward, reaching its peak intensity of on September 2 while east-southeast of West Palm Beach, Florida. On September 2, Frances entered the Bahamas, passing directly over San Salvador Island and very close to Cat Island. The storm weakened to a Category 3 hurricane by 2 pm, which was initially attributed to inner core processes, but increasing westerly winds aloft, and the resultant vertical wind shear, was later determined to be the cause. On September 3, Frances passed into the vicinity of Abaco Island and directly over Grand Bahama while continuing to slowly weaken. The storm regained Category 2 hurricane intensity prior to passing over Grand Bahama Island and also slowed in forward speed due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to its north. Parts of South Florida began to be affected by squalls and the outer rainbands of the hurricane at this time. Gusts from to as high as were reported from Jupiter Inlet to Miami.

Frances moved slowly, between , as it crossed the warm Gulf Stream between the Bahamas and Florida, leading to the concern that it could restrengthen. However, Frances remained stable at Category 2 intensity with maximum sustained winds while it battered the east coast of Florida between Fort Pierce and West Palm Beach for much of September 4. At 11 pm, the western edge of the eyewall began moving onshore. Because of its large eye, which was roughly across, and its slow forward motion, the center of circulation remained offshore for several more hours. At 1 am EDT on September 5 (0500 UTC), the center of the broad eye of Frances made landfall along the Florida coast, at the southern end of Hutchinson Island, near Sewall&#x27;s Point, Jensen Beach, and Port Salerno, Florida. Late on September 5, Frances picked up speed due to a strengthening high pressure system to its north and crossed the Florida Peninsula, emerging over the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa as a tropical storm. After a short trip over the Gulf of Mexico, Frances made a second landfall near St. Marks, Florida. Frances headed inland, weakening to a tropical depression and causing heavy rainfall over the southern and eastern United States. As Tropical Depression Frances turned northeast, United States meteorologists at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center continued issuing advisories on the system until it crossed the Canada–United States border into Quebec, where heavy rainfall also fell.

== Preparations ==

A tropical storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands during the afternoon of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern British Virgin Islands, the northern United States Virgin Islands, Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a tropical storm watch. That afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, British Virgin Islands, and the northern U. S. Virgin Islands while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.

Early on the morning of August 31, tropical storm warnings were dropped for Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, and St. Kitts while hurricane watches were issued for the southeast Bahamas as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands. Hurricane watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that morning. Toward noon, tropical storm warnings were issued for the remainder of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, a hurricane watch was issued for the central Bahamas, while all watches and warnings were dropped for northeast portion of the Dominican Republic and portions of the Lesser Antilles south of the British Virgin Islands. That afternoon, tropical storm warnings were dropped from Puerto Rico eastward. On the morning of September 1, a hurricane watch was issued for the northwest Bahamas while the watch for the central Bahamas was upgraded to a warning. That afternoon, warnings were dropped for the Dominican Republic.

On the evening of September 1, hurricane warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida&#x27;s heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000 people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8 million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida&#x27;s history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week. The entire Major League Baseball series between the Florida Marlins and Chicago Cubs was postponed as well. Walt Disney World closed on September 4 and September 5  — only the third time it had closed for a hurricane, but the second time in a month.

Early during the morning of September 2, hurricane watches were extended southward to Craig Key. Later that morning, hurricane watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings for the lower east coast of Florida while a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was raised for most of the Florida Keys and Florida Bay. Hurricane warnings were dropped for the Turks and Caicos Islands late on the morning of September 1 and for the Southeast Bahamas late that night. Late on the morning of September 3, hurricane watches were issued for the northeast coast of Florida, while early that afternoon tropical storm warnings were issued for the same area. Hurricane warnings were dropped for the central Bahamas that afternoon. That night, tropical storm warnings were issued for the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula with watches issued for the northwest Florida peninsula. On the morning of September 4, tropical storm warnings were extended northward to Anna Maria Island and along the Georgia coast. Tropical storm watches were extended northward to St. Marks, Florida. That afternoon, hurricane watches were dropped for most of the northwest Bahamas while warnings were extended up the coast to St. Marks, and watches were extended westward to Panama City, Florida.

Early on morning of September 5, hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings south of Deerfield Beach, Florida, while tropical storm warnings were extended westward through the western Florida Keys. Later that morning, hurricane warnings were issued for most of the northwest Florida coast while hurricane watches were lowered for northeast Florida and hurricane warnings were dropped for the remainder of the northwest Bahamas. That afternoon, all warnings were dropped for southeast Florida south of Jupiter Inlet, while the remaining hurricane warnings along the east Florida coast were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. Hurricane warnings along the coast of western Florida were extended southward to Anna Maria Island. Late that night, tropical storm warnings were dropped south of Bonita Beach including all the Florida Keys. Early on the morning of September 6, all warnings were dropped in Florida south of Englewood and Cocoa Beach. Later that morning, hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings between Indian Pass and Destin as well as between Anna Maria Island and the Suwannee River while all remaining warnings were dropped south of Anna Maria Island, as well as the Florida east coast and the Georgia coast. That afternoon, all hurricane warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings, with all warnings dropped between west of St. Marks and south of the Suwannee river. On the night of September 6, all remaining tropical cyclone warnings were dropped.

==Impact==
The economic effect was felt early, as the storm struck during Labor Day weekend, traditionally the final summer vacation weekend in the United States. Many hotel reservations from South Carolina to Florida were canceled as people, seeing the destruction caused weeks earlier by Hurricane Charley, decided to avoid the coastal areas for safety. One death in the Bahamas, one in Ohio, and five in Florida were directly attributed to the storm. 42 more deaths - 32 in Florida, eight in Georgia, one in the Bahamas and one in Ohio, are indirectly attributed to Frances.

The total civilian damage from Frances was determined to be approximately US$8.86 billion (2004 dollars). Add in the estimated US$100 million damage (2004 dollars) done to space and military facilities at Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Patrick Air Force Base, Florida and the total damage was estimated to be about US$9 billion (2004 dollars), making it the fourth costliest hurricane in United States history at that time, behind Hurricane Andrew of 1992 and Hurricanes Charley and Ivan of 2004. At the time, adjusted for inflation, it became the seventh costliest hurricane for the lower 48 United States. Flooding was also reported in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Minor flooding happened along the banks of the three rivers and more damage was associated with river tributaries.

=== Lucayan Archipelago ===

Although the hurricane moved close to the Turks and Caicos Islands, only minor impact occurred there. More than a dozen homes sustained damage. One person was rescued after the roof blew off her residence.

In the Bahamas, between 13 and 17 percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Frances destroyed five homes on the island, while eighty others experienced suffered roof damage. San Salvador reported a wind gust of , the strongest gust observed in the Bahamas. The streets of the city capital of Nassau were littered with falling trees and satellite dishes. At nearby Cable Beach, a grocery store completely lost its roof.

Approximately 50% of residences in Coopers Town and North Abaco on the Abaco Islands sustained damage, with some losing a large amount of their roofs. Additionally, about 20 homes were flooded in Marsh Harbour. Several people suffered injuries when the roof of a hospital collapsed in South Abaco; patients were evacuated to Nassau by helicopter. On Grand Bahama, several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport, while about of water covered streets and surrounded homes nearby. Bahamian member of parliament Obie Wilchcombe reported that during the eye of the storm, he and others rescued approximately 70 people, who became trapped after storm surge entered their residences on the west end of the island.

About 75% of the island chain lost power for a few hours during the storm. Insurers and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300 million (2004 dollars) throughout the Bahamas. All cool-season vegetable plantings, and the entire banana crop, were lost during Frances. The pineapple crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit crop was lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced. Two people in the Bahamas were killed by the storm, one directly and the other indirectly.

===Florida===

Prior to Frances weakening to a tropical storm, hurricane-force winds in Florida extended up to a width of from the cyclone&#x27;s center. The highest recorded sustained wind speed in Florida was at the United States Army Corps of Engineers&#x27;s Port Mayaca station. Officially, wind gust observations in the state reached as high as in Fort Pierce, while an identical, unofficial wind gust was reported in Martin County. Consequently, a peak total of 4,270,583 customers across Florida lost electricity. Additionally, wind damage to citrus groves led to a near total loss near the coast of east-central and southeast Florida between Boca Raton and Melbourne, with lesser damage farther to the west across the Kissimmee River basin. Between Hurricane Charley and Frances, citrus losses totaled $2 billion.

Frances also produced heavy rains in the state, peaking at in Kent Grove, near Spring Hill. Large portions of west-central and northeast Florida also reported precipitation amounts of at least . Significant storm surge impacted both coasts, with a surge up to above mean sea level recorded at the St. Lucie Lock. However, the National Weather Service estimated that storm surge may have reached as high as above ground near Vero Beach. Extensive to moderate erosion impacted the Atlantic coast of Florida from Martin County to Volusia County, resulting in substantial damage to 546 structures within the Coastal Building Zone. On the Gulf Coast, however, erosion and coastal flood specifically relating to the storm often became difficult to determine due to Charley less than a month earlier and then Ivan and Jeanne shortly after Frances.

Frances produced tropical storm-force wind gusts as far south as the Florida Keys. However, only minor damage was reported there. In Southwest Florida, Glades and Hendry recorded sustained tropical storm-force winds and hurricane-force wind gusts. The former suffered about $25 million in damage – $20 million to crops and $5 million to property. Each county of the Miami metropolitan area – Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach – reported hundreds of thousands of power outages. Significant impacts occurred in parts of South Florida, especially Palm Beach County, where the southern eyewall of Frances crossed as it made landfall farther north. Heavy rains, including at Palm Beach International Airport, caused a large sinkhole to develop on Interstate 95, which closed the highway to traffic. Roughly 15,000 houses and 2,400 businesses in the county were inflicted some degree of damage. Frances left about $570 million in damage in Palm Beach County, with about $70 million incurred to crops. Broward and Miami-Dade counties suffered about $80 million and $34 million in damages, respectively.

Near the point of its first landfall, few structures were destroyed and ocean overwash across the barrier island was limited, though the extent of the damage far exceeded that of Hurricane Charley. Significant tree damage was reported within golf courses along the Treasure Coast, with an average of 300-500 trees experiencing damage per course. Throughout the tri-county region – Martin, Indian River, and St. Lucie – hundreds of businesses, homes, and mobile homes suffered destruction, while thousands of other structures experienced various degrees of damage. The storm inflicted impacts on 1,319 homes in Martin County, 52 of which were destroyed. In St. Lucie County, Frances destroyed the municipal marina in Fort Pierce and several hangars at the Treasure Coast International Airport. A total of 1,129 dwellings in the county became uninhabitable. At least 3,000 homes and about 50% of businesses were damaged in Indian River County. Property damage in the Treasure Coast totaled approximately $4.5 billion, while roughly $88.8 million in crop damage also occurred in the region.

Just inland from the Treasure Coast, Okeechobee County likely experienced sustained hurricane-force winds in most areas. The storm damaged 22,688 homes, nearly 700 of which were demolished. In Osceola County, Frances damaged 69 dwellings and 3 businesses. Heavy rainfall caused major street flooding in Kissimmee and St. Cloud, while water entered some workplaces and residences. The Orlando International Airport in Orange County reported sustained winds of and gusts up to . Across the county, the cyclone damaged some 3,000 homes and 1,600 businesses.

Ground-level wind gusts in Brevard County reached at Merritt Island Airport. Across the county, Frances damaged 12,130 homes to some degree. Additionally, the storm ripped off 820 4-by-10 foot aluminum panels covering the large Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center. While Charley caused $700,000 damage, Frances&#x27;s damage was significantly greater. Two external fuel tanks for the Space Shuttle were in the building but seemed undamaged. The Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s hangar was without power. Overall, Brevard County experienced about $277.6 million in damage, with more than one-third of that figure, $100 million, incurred to space and military facilities around Cape Canaveral. Volusia County was also among those experiencing the most extensive effects. Throughout the county, Frances damaged 478 businesses, 19,958 single-family homes, 4,800 mobile homes, and 1,414 agriculture-related structures. The hurricane left about $238.5 million in damage in the county.

===Georgia===
Frances dropped significant rain on Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and North and South Carolina. The passage of tropical depression Frances into Georgia dumped up to of rain onto the state and caused the closings of schools in 56 counties. Across Georgia, winds of , with gusts to led to the downing of tree branches and power lines. At one point on September 7, a total of 380,000 residences were without power. Significant crop damage was seen, particularly to the cotton and the peanut crops. On average, 30 percent of the crops were lost during Frances.

===Carolinas===
Flooding was reported even in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast states, particularly along the Appalachian Mountains. A strip of upslope-induced rainfall along the Blue Ridge escarpment produced as much as of rain in some areas of western North Carolina as the warm tropical air surged up and over the mountains. Flooding along the Swannanoa River near Asheville, North Carolina caused a major break in Asheville&#x27;s water distribution system, leaving the city without water for several days. The Pigeon River flooded in Haywood County, leaving many homeless and many businesses closed, including the town hall of Canton. Significant crop damage was seen into North Carolina, which reported $55 million in crop damage. Frances also spawned 101 tornadoes from Florida to as far north as Virginia, shy of the single storm tornado record set during Hurricane Beulah.
Power outages affected up to six million people. Over 20 airports closed during the storm.

===Canada===
As an extratropical cyclone, Frances passed through southern Ontario. The storm dropped up to , washing out roads and causing localized flooding in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland. This rainfall smashed all-time rainfall records in a 24-hour period (most of the rain fell in a 6 to 8 hour-period). Ottawa&#x27;s O-Train Trillium Line was halted because of a landslide that obstructed the railroad corridor. Several major roads in Gatineau and Ottawa were under several inches of water, locally chest-high. More than $45 million (2004 CAD; US$41 million) in insured damage was reported in Ontario.

==Aftermath==

===Bahamas===
Frances is the first hurricane to impact the entire archipelago since 1866. On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of Environmental Health Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when it was noted that major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.

===Florida===

In the aftermath of the storm, many colleges and school districts across Florida remained closed. President George W. Bush declared all of Florida a federal disaster area. Kennedy Space Center did not restore its complete work force until September 13 due to relief operations, as well as a lack of gasoline, ice, and water in the area. A total of 8000 members of the National Guard helped out with recovery efforts soon after the storm left the Florida peninsula. Residents in the areas of impact after the storm were under a boil water order, because of the lack of electricity to area water systems. Churches prepared meals for people without power and food. Federal employees were granted excused absences if they helped with law enforcement and the cleanup. Thousands of portable generators were sent to the state by Home Depot and Lowe&#x27;s home improvement stores. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed blue tarpaulins on 41,556 damaged roofs statewide. Damage to the Florida citrus crop caused orange futures to rise four cents a pound.

===Georgia and the Carolinas===
On September 24, the southern two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush. The state lost 50 percent of its pecan crop due to Frances, which led to a price rise in pecans by late October. Lost peach trees were expected to lower output during 2005, and increase peach prices. A disaster declaration was made for the northeast section of South Carolina on October 7. On September 10, President Bush declared 34 counties within North Carolina a disaster area, making them eligible for US$6.5 million (2004 dollars) in public assistance. A Wildlife Commission removed its North Carolina Mountain State Fair exhibit due to Frances midway through the fair. Over 100,000 trout were lost due to the storm in the Pisgah, Table Rock, Marion, and Armstrong state fish hatcheries. Red Cross volunteers distributed over 200,000 gallons of water by its 600 volunteers in four days. After Frances and Hurricane Ivan, Asheville determined that it needed $14 million in order to buy out willing businesses and homes within the floodplain.

===Retirement===

Because of the hurricane&#x27;s effects in the United States, the name &quot;Frances&quot; was retired from the rotating lists of tropical cyclone names in the spring of 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone. The name was replaced with &quot;Fiona&quot; for the 2010 season.

<text>Peter Cash is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

He was a member of Skydiggers from 1987 to 1996. After leaving that band, he began to write and record music with his brother, singer-songwriter Andrew Cash, which was released as The Cash Brothers.

Peter Cash is an established figure in the Canadian music scene. He was the principal songwriter for the Skydiggers from 1987 to 1996. In 1989, the Skydiggers became the first Canadian signing to Enigma Records. Their self-titled debut album was released the following year, and spawned the singles &quot;Monday Morning&quot; and &quot;I Will Give You Everything&quot;. In 1992, FRE Records released the band&#x27;s second (and most popular) album, &quot;Restless&quot;. &quot;A Penny More&quot;, the lead single from &quot;Restless&quot;, became their biggest hit, produced by John Oliveira and the band at Hamilton&#x27;s Grant Avenue Studios.
In 1993, the Skydiggers&#x27; third album, &quot;Just Over This Mountain&quot;, was released and consolidated the band&#x27;s status by winning a number of music awards, including the Juno Award for Most Promising Group.

After the tour to support the Road Radio album, Peter Cash left the band. After ten years of touring, writing, and recording with the Skydiggers, Peter and his brother, singer-songwriter Andrew Cash joined musical forces. The result was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Raceway&quot;. The first song that they recorded together, in 1997, was the title track on the album.

The Cash Brothers earned critical acclaim and the respect of peers and fans alike with follow up albums How was Tomorrow (2001) and Brand New Night (2003).

In 2006, The Cash Brothers teamed up with the Skydiggers to release an acoustic album.

<text>Kim Anna Bingham, also known by her stage names Mudgirl and The Kim Band, is a Canadian singer, guitarist, composer, songwriter and musician. She is known for her musical collaborations with Nelly Furtado, Bran Van 3000 and David Usher.

== Career ==

=== 1990-1994: Me Mom and Morgentaler ===
Bingham began her career in music as a member of the Montreal, Quebec, third-wave ska band Me Mom and Morgentaler formed in 1990. The band became known for elaborate live performances and spectacles of vaudevillian-styled performance art. With the band, Bingham recorded three works: &quot;Clown Heaven and Hell&quot; EP (1991), &quot;Shiva Space Machine&quot; (1993), and Live &quot;We Are Revolting: Live &amp; Obscure 1990–1994&quot; (1994).

=== 1994–1999: Mudgirl ===
In 1994, Bingham left Me, Mom, and Morgentaler and moved to Vancouver where she formed the project Mudgirl with drummer/vocalist Glenn Kruger (Carly Rae Jepsen, the Paperboys, Bloody Chicletts), bassist/vocalist Russell Less (Innocents Abroad, the Ground), and guitarist Lucas Truman. Her moniker &quot;Mudgirl&quot; was chosen based on &quot;the title of a short story she wrote about a waif made of mud&quot; intended for children. She stated, &quot;Mudgirl is an extension of myself where I get to be cartoony and a bit surreal.&quot; In 1996, Mudgirl released their debut five-song EP &quot;First Book&quot; which included three Canadian radio hits &quot;This Day&quot;, &quot;Adjusted,&quot; and &quot;Contact&quot; (written by Russell Less). She also produced a handful of popular videos featured on MuchMusic, and performed on some dates in the U.S., including a July 1996 performance with Mudgirl at Lilith Fair.

=== 1999–2006: The Kim Band ===

After five years as Mudgirl, Bingham decided to change the name of her collective to &quot;The Kim Band&quot;. Under this moniker, she released the album &quot;Girlology&quot; (2001), produced by Steven Drake (The Odds, The Tragically Hip). The album featured the radio singles &quot;What A Drag&quot;, &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Quel Dommage&quot;, her French version of &quot;What A Drag,&quot; which reached No. 1 on the French-Canadian radio charts.

=== Collaborations with David Usher, Nelly Furtado and Bran Van 3000: 2000–2003: Touring, bands ===
From 2001 until 2003, Bingham worked with Canadian singer David Usher as a guitarist and backing vocalist. &quot;Black Black Heart&quot; is a song written by Usher and Jeff Pearce and for which the operatic female vocal is provided by Bingham, while the chorus samples &quot;The Flower Duet&quot; (Sous le dôme épais), a duet for sopranos from Léo Delibes&#x27; opera Lakmé, as a hook. &quot;Black Black Heart&quot; won two MuchMusic Video Awards for Best Post-Production and Best Pop Video in 2002.

In 2003 and early 2004, Bingham toured Europe and the U.S. with pop singer Nelly Furtado as a guitarist and backing vocalist in Furtado&#x27;s band. Bingham also collaborated with Bran Van 3000 and is featured on the albums &quot;Rosé&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot;. Bingham also toured in Canada as part of Bran Van 3000, including a concert as the main act at the Montreal Jazz Festival in 2008.

=== Les Invincibles 2005–2009 ===

From 2005 to 2009, Bingham composed the soundtrack for the TV trilogy &quot;Les Invincibles&quot; with three seasons on the original Canadian TV production (broadcast on Radio Canada) and two seasons on the reprised European versions, a Franco-Belgian-German production (broadcast on Arte). In 2007, Bingham&#x27;s original music for the Canadian series was nominated for Best Original Score at the Prix Gémeaux television award; Bingham won the Best Theme Song award with the theme song &quot;The Heroes Take&quot;, shared with co-writer and show creator Jean-François Rivard. Also in 2007, at the request of fans of the Canadian TV show, Bingham performed and produced the soundtrack album &quot;Les Invincibles&quot; with the support of Warner Music Canada.

=== UP! and single releases 2010–2020 ===
Bingham&#x27;s next work, the full-length album &quot;UP!&quot;, was recorded in Los Angeles over the summer of 2010 with co-producer John Kastner (Doughboys, All Systems Go!) and with members of bands such as Queens of the Stone Age, Jellyfish, Blind Melon, and Masters of Reality. The album was released in May 2012 under Bingham&#x27;s longstanding indie label, Mudgirl Music Group.

The stop-motion animation video for the single &quot;Up!&quot; won the Best Video award at the 2013 edition of the Independent Music Awards. The French version of &quot;UP!&quot; and the sole French single on the album, a song called &quot;Party Girl&quot;, were once again radio hits for Bingham in French-speaking parts of Canada. In January 2019, &quot;Bel Ami&quot; was chosen as the theme song for the US TV series &quot;Good Trouble&quot;. In summer 2019, Bingham released her first single, performed in both English and Italian, the upbeat pop song &quot;Beppe Green&quot;.

== Style ==
According to &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot;, Bingham &quot;plays a musical style modeled after the eclectic pop of The The.&quot;

<doc id="947305" wikidata="Q7133931" url="?curid=947305" title="Parachute Rigger Badge">
<text>The Parachute Rigger Badge is a military qualification badge of the United States Army and the United States Air Force which was first created in 1948 and officially approved in June 1986. The award is intended as a badge for enlisted, warrant officer and officer personnel who have successfully completed parachute rigger courses specified by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School.

== History ==
The first parachute rigger badge was designed in 1948 by Major Thomas R. Cross and drawn by Sergeant First Class Ewing of the 11th Parachute Maintenance Company, 11th Airborne Division at Camp Schimmelpfennig, Sendai, Japan, and was first used operationally during Exercise Swarmer in 1950.

Prior to the official adoption of the badge, it had been worn under Major Command commander&#x27;s authority to authorize the wear of locally designed badges on the utility uniform.

Official adoption of the badge had been sought for many years by a variety of Quartermaster officials. The adoption was based on a formal request submitted by Mr. James S. Emery, Military Analyst, Airborne Department, Quartermaster School in 1983. Emery, formerly COL Emery, had at one time been the officer in charge of the Rigger School. Under his command, the school installed the first female Rigger Instructors in 1977: Deborah Petrie, Maintenance; Joann Jackson, Pack; and Stacy Kates, Air Drop. Emery&#x27;s request received unprecedented support from the field; unfortunately it was disapproved at the time. In 1986, General Richard H. Thompson, commander of the U.S. Army Materiel Command and the senior Quartermaster officer in the Army wrote the Chief of Staff of the Army asking him to reconsider the 1983 decision. After requesting some field comments, General Wickham approved the parachute riggers badge on 9 June 1986.

== Badge eligibility ==
In order to be eligible to attend any Parachute Rigger courses and subsequently be awarded the Parachute Rigger Badge, an individual must first have graduated from the Basic Airborne Course at Ft. Moore, Georgia.

The badge is awarded upon graduation from a parachute rigger course as specified by the U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School. In 1999, the Army authorized the retroactive award of the Parachute Rigger Badge to individuals who performed duty as riggers before May 1951, but did not attend or graduate for a Parachute Rigger course at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School, located at Ft. Lee, Virginia.

The first Military Occupational Specialty for the Parachute Rigger was 43E. Later, those earning the Parachute Rigger Badge receive either the Enlisted Military Occupational Specialty Code 92R or the Warrant Officer designation 921A. The Parachute Rigger Badge may also be awarded to officers, upon completion of the Aerial Delivery Management Officer Course (ADMOC) who earn the Additional Skill Identifier of 92AR9. or other courses specified by AR 600-8-22.

The Parachute Rigger badge can be revoked when the Parachutist Badge is revoked, when an individual refuses an order to make a parachute jump with a parachute the individual packed, or when the individual initiates an action which results in withdrawal of the individual&#x27;s MOS before the individual completes 36 months in a parachute position.

== Air Force authorization ==
In mid-2009, the Air Force&#x27;s 98th Virtual Uniform Board announced &quot;Airmen earning and awarded the Parachute Riggers Badge are authorized permanent wear on all uniform combinations. For the airman battle uniform and the battle dress uniform, the badge will be blue. On the desert combat uniform the approved color is brown.&quot; In January 2014, the Air Force expanded that decision to allow the permanent wear of any special skill badge that has been awarded by another service.

Previous guidance had limited the wear of the badge to airmen attached to Army rigger units. Air Force parachute riggers are typically found in the aerial port squadron of an airlift wing or group, where they pack loads for training airdrops. Others, trained in the maintenance of aircrew emergency parachutes and other aircrew equipment, are assigned to flying unit life support sections.

<doc id="947310" wikidata="Q2624320" url="?curid=947310" title="United States Department of Energy National Laboratories">
<text>The United States Department of Energy National Laboratories and Technology Centers is a system of laboratories overseen by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for scientific and technological research. The primary mission of the DOE national laboratories is to conduct research and development (R&amp;D) addressing national priorities: energy and climate, the environment, national security, and health. Sixteen of the seventeen DOE national laboratories are federally funded research and development centers administered, managed, operated and staffed by private-sector organizations under management and operating (M&amp;O) contracts with the DOE. The National Laboratory system was established in the wake of World War II, during which the United States had quickly set-up and pursued advanced scientific research in the sprawling Manhattan Project.

== The laboratories and their research mission ==

The DOE is the nation&#x27;s largest sponsor of research in the physical sciences and engineering, and is second to the Department of Defense in supporting computer sciences and mathematics. Most of that research is performed by the national laboratories.

Although the national laboratories form an integrated system, each of them has its individual mission, capabilities, and structure. 
 The chart shows the nature of the research done at each laboratory. 

All 17 of the laboratories are listed below, along with the location, establishment date, and the organization that currently operates each.

== National Scientific User Facilities ==
The DOE Office of Science operates an extensive network of 28 national scientific user facilities. A total of over 30,000 scientific users from universities, national laboratories, and technology companies use these facilities to advance their research and development. The staff of experts at each facility who build and operate the associated instruments and work with visiting scientists to mount experiments with them. This access and support is provided without charge to qualified scientific groups, with priority based on recommendations by expert review panels. All six research offices support scientific user facilities at national laboratories.

== History ==
The system of national laboratories started with the massive scientific endeavors of World War II, in which several new technologies, especially the atomic bomb, proved decisive for the Allied victory. Though the United States government had begun seriously investing in scientific research for national security in World War I, it was only in this wartime period that significant resources were committed to scientific problems, under the auspices first of the National Defense Research Committee, and later the Office of Scientific Research and Development, organized and administered by Vannevar Bush.

During the Second World War, centralized sites such as the Radiation Laboratory at MIT and Ernest O. Lawrence&#x27;s laboratory at Berkeley and the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago allowed for a large number of expert scientists to collaborate towards defined goals as never before, and with government resources of unprecedented scale at their disposal.

In the course of the war, the Allied nuclear effort, the Manhattan Project, created several secret sites for the purpose of bomb research and material development, including a laboratory in the mountains of New Mexico directed by Robert Oppenheimer (Los Alamos), and sites at Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Hanford and Oak Ridge were administered by private companies, and Los Alamos was administered by a public university (the University of California). Additional success was had at the University of Chicago in reactor research, leading to the creation of Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago, and at other academic institutions spread across the country.

After the war and its scientific successes, the newly created Atomic Energy Commission took over the future of the wartime laboratories, extending their lives indefinitely (they were originally thought of as temporary creations). Funding and infrastructure were secured to sponsor other &quot;national laboratories&quot; for both classified and basic research, especially in physics, with each national laboratory centered around one or many expensive machines (such as particle accelerators or nuclear reactors).

Most national laboratories maintained staffs of local researchers as well as allowing for visiting researchers to use their equipment, though priority to local or visiting researchers often varied from lab to lab. With their centralization of resources (both monetary and intellectual), the national labs serve as an exemplar for Big Science.

The national laboratory system, administered first by the Atomic Energy Commission, then the Energy Research and Development Administration, and currently the Department of Energy, is one of the largest (if not the largest) scientific research systems in the world. The DOE provides about a third of the total national funding for physics, chemistry, materials science, and other areas of the physical sciences.

<text>Thomas Pearsall Field Hoving (January 15, 1931 – December 10, 2009) was an American museum executive and consultant and the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

==Early life==
He was born in New York City to Walter Hoving, the head of Tiffany &amp; Company, and his wife, Mary Osgood Field, a descendant of Samuel Osgood. Hoving grew up surrounded by New York&#x27;s upper social strata. As recounted in his memoir, &quot;Making the Mummies Dance&quot;, these early experiences would be invaluable in his later dealings with the Met&#x27;s donors and trustees.

After schooling at Manhattan&#x27;s Buckley School, Eaglebrook School in Massachusetts and a brief stint at Exeter, Hoving graduated from the Hotchkiss School in 1949. He received a B.A. in 1953, an M.F.A. in 1958, and a Ph.D. in 1959, all from Princeton University.

==Career==
As an undergraduate he majored in art and archaeology and supplemented his studies with regular trips to New York City to draw at the Art Students League. He went to work for the Met in 1959, serving on the staff of the medieval department at The Cloisters until 1965, when he became curator of the department.

He left the Met in 1966 to become New York mayor John V. Lindsay&#x27;s parks commissioner, but in 1967 returned to the Met as director after the incumbent, James J. Rorimer, died suddenly on May 11, 1966. He assumed the directorship on March 17, 1967, and presided over a massive expansion and renovation of the museum, adding many important collections to its holdings.

===Career at the Metropolitan Museum of Art===
 His tenure at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was characterized by his distinctive approach to expanding the Met&#x27;s collections. Rather than build more comprehensive holdings of relatively modest works, he pursued a smaller number of what he termed &quot;world-class&quot; pieces, including the Euphronios Krater depicting the death of Sarpedon (returned to Italy in 2008), Velázquez&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Juan de Pareja&quot;, and the Temple of Dendur.

The expansion of the Met during Hoving&#x27;s directorship was not confined to its collections. Hoving also spearheaded a number of building projects and renovations of the Met itself, from a controversial expansion of its galleries into Central Park to the construction of its underground parking garage.

Two of the building&#x27;s most characteristic features—the huge exterior banners announcing current shows, and the broad plaza and steps leading from Fifth Avenue to the Met&#x27;s entryway—are products of Hoving&#x27;s tenure. At one point, he even floated a plan to remove the Met&#x27;s &quot;great staircase&quot; leading from the central lobby to the second-floor galleries. That particular project remains unrealized.

Hoving described the negotiations between the Metropolitan Museum, the Cairo Museum, Egypt&#x27;s Organization of Antiquities, and the U.S. State Department to bring the exhibition &quot;The Treasures of Tutankhamun&quot; to the Met as &quot;the high point of my Metropolitan career.&quot; The exhibition was the result of years of negotiations, including plans for a variety of cross-cultural collaborations, galvanized by President Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s June 1974 trip to Egypt and finalized in an accord signed by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmi in October 1975. In July 1976, Hoving visited Egypt to negotiate terms of the traveling exhibition and finalize details of the Museum&#x27;s collaboration with officials there.

Hoving was the director of the controversial &quot;Harlem On My Mind&quot; exhibit, curated by Allon Schoener, which garnered significant protests from local activists and artists for its exclusion of black artists, as well as for the inclusion of an anti-Semitic essay in the catalogue. Hoving apologized and included disclaimers before the essay in the catalogue, but did not remove it.

In his memoirs he revealed 2009 that Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s masterpiece Mona Lisa was sprinkled for several hours inside the Metropolitan Museum.

===Later career===
He left the Met on June 30, 1977, to start an independent consulting firm for museums, Hoving Associates. From 1978 to 1984 he was an arts correspondent for the ABC newsmagazine &quot;20/20&quot;. His debut in its second-ever installment on June 13, 1978 was a feature about the making of &quot;Jaws 2&quot;. In 1978, he published &quot;Tutankhamun. The Untold Story&quot;, a non-fiction book about the discovery of the Egyptian tomb, with particular attention to its discoverer, Howard Carter. He edited &quot;Connoisseur Magazine&quot; from 1981 to 1991; along with his memoirs of his time at the Met, he is also the author of books on a number of art-related subjects, including art forgeries, Grant Wood, Andrew Wyeth, Tutankhamen, and the 12th-century walrus ivory crucifix known as the Bury St. Edmunds Cross. Additionally, in 1999, he wrote the text for the &quot;Art For Dummies&quot; book in the &quot;...For Dummies&quot; series.

==Personal life==
In 1953, Hoving was married to Nancy Bell, a Vassar College graduate whom he met at a house party in Princeton. She was the daughter of Elliott V. Bell (1902–1983), a writer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; who managed the two successful gubernatorial campaigns for his friend, Thomas E. Dewey. They had a daughter.

Hoving died of lung cancer at his home in Manhattan, New York City, on December 10, 2009.

==In popular culture==
Hoving appeared in &quot;Who the *$&amp;% Is Jackson Pollock?&quot;, a 2006 documentary by Harry Moses about a supposed &quot;lost&quot; Jackson Pollock painting, where he dismissed the claims, believing that true connoisseurs are the only ones who can identify the real from fake paintings and that fingerprints and forensic evidence are secondary. The clincher, he stated, was that the &#x27;Pollock&#x27; painting had a gesso ground, something that Pollock never used. 

He was the subject of the titular profile in &quot;A Roomful of Hovings and Other Profiles&quot;, a 1969 collection of biographical pieces by John McPhee.

<doc id="947323" wikidata="Q7756019" url="?curid=947323" title="The Paper Chase (Osborn novel)">
<text>The Paper Chase is a 1971 novel written by John Jay Osborn Jr., a 1970 graduate of Harvard Law School. The book tells the story of Hart, a first-year law student at Harvard, and his experiences with Professor Charles Kingsfield, a brilliant and demanding contracts instructor whom he both idolizes and finds incredibly intimidating.

The novel inspired an eponymous 1973 film and then a television series, which ran from 1978 to 1979 and from 1983 to 1986.

Osborn wrote the novel as a third-year student at Harvard Law School. William Alfred, a Harvard humanities professor and playwright, coached him in writing the book.

==Plot==
The story centers on Hart, a young law student from Minnesota who attends Harvard Law School and becomes obsessed with one of his teachers, Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. Hart becomes an expert on Kingsfield&#x27;s subject, contracts; he reads everything about the subject, including all of Kingsfield&#x27;s papers, most of which are not on the reading list. He goes so far as to break into the law library to read Kingsfield&#x27;s original law school notes. Hart becomes such an expert that Kingsfield asks him to contribute to a paper.

At the same time, he begins a relationship with Susan Field, who turns out to be Kingsfield&#x27;s daughter. Susan stands aloof from the law school rat race and dismisses all the things Hart cares about most.

After much effort preparing for final exams, Hart&#x27;s grades are delivered to him, but he simply makes a paper airplane out of the envelope, and sends it sailing into the Atlantic Ocean without looking at it.

==Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr==
Professor Charles W. Kingsfield Jr. is one of the key characters in the novel, film and television series. Kingsfield is an imperious, highly respected (and feared) professor of contracts at Harvard Law School, known for his unrelenting use of the Socratic method on his students. Kingsfield was a law student at Harvard, as shown by the presence of his own class notes in the institution&#x27;s archives. Kingsfield has a daughter with a fiercely independent personality.

During an event at Harvard Law School to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the book&#x27;s release, Osborn said that the character was a composite of several of his professors at Harvard Law School, saying, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like it was hard to find role models.&quot; Many Harvard Law graduates believe the character to be a composite of Contracts professor Clark Byse and Property Law professor A. J. Casner, legendary intimidating users of the Socratic method. Osborn has stated that Contracts was his favorite law school course. Actor John Houseman, who played the role in the film and television series, said that he based his performance, in part, on stories he was told by former students of Edward Henry Warren, a professor at the law school from 1904 to 1945. Warren, who taught a first-year property law course, was famous at the school for his sarcastic comments during lectures and intimidating manner. Houseman&#x27;s performance was also based on his experience as a professor and director of the drama department at the Juilliard School.

==40th-anniversary edition==
In 2010, a 40th-anniversary edition of &quot;The Paper Chase&quot; was released by Peninsula Road Press, which contains a new preface. This edition is the only one prepared by the author.

==Adaptations==
===Film===

According to Osborn, the 1973 film is based &quot;almost word for word&quot; on the novel. It starred John Houseman as Kingsfield and Timothy Bottoms as Hart.

===Television series===

CBS aired a one-hour drama series in the 1978–1979 season based on the movie. John Houseman reprised his movie role, and James Stephens played Hart. In 1983, pay cable network Showtime brought back the show with both Houseman and Stephens. At the end of three seasons on Showtime, Hart finally graduated.

<text>Pickering is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England, on the border of the North York Moors National Park. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is at the foot of the moors, overlooking the Vale of Pickering to the south.
Pickering Parish Church, with its medieval wall paintings, Pickering Castle, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Beck Isle Museum have made Pickering popular with visitors. Nearby places include Malton, Norton-on-Derwent and Scarborough.
==History==

Positioned on the shores of a glacial lake at the end of the last ice age, Pickering was in an ideal place for early settlers to benefit from the multiple natural resources of the moorlands to the north, the wetlands to the south, running water in the beck and the forests all around. It had wood, stone, wildfowl, game, fish, fresh water and fertile easily worked soils. The east–west route from the coast passed along the foothills of the North York Moors through the site at a place where the beck could be forded.
There is evidence of Celtic and Roman era habitation in the areas surrounding Pickering but little remains in the town. Legendary sources suggest an early date for the establishment of a town but traces of earlier settlements have been erased by subsequent development.

The town probably existed throughout the Anglo-Saxon period of British history. According to the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; there was enough arable land for 27 ploughs, meadows and extensive woodlands. The town may have grown up to service the Norman castle.

===After the conquest===

After 1066 when William I became the King, the town and its neighbourhood were in the possession of the crown. A castle and church were built at this time and the medieval kings occasionally visited the area. After the Harrying of the North by the Normans, the value of the village fell from £88 to £1. In 1267 the manor, castle and forest of Pickering were given by Henry III to his youngest son, Edmund, 1st Earl of Lancaster. The estate was confiscated by the King and then returned. Eventually, it passed to Henry, Duke of Lancaster who became King Henry IV of England. It has belonged to the monarch ever since.

In 1598 the streets of Pickering were: East Gate, Hall Garth, Hungate, Birdgate, Borrowgate (the present Burgate) and West Gate.

Many older small houses were built at this time, some of stone with thatched roofs. The stocks, shambles and the market cross stood in the centre of town in the Market Place. The castle fell into disrepair yet the town flourished. In the English Civil War, Parliamentary soldiers were quartered in the town and damaged the church and castle and Pickering was the location of a minor skirmish but not a pitched battle.

In the 1650s George Fox, the founder of Society of Friends, or Quakers, visited the town to preach on at least two occasions.

Nicholas Postgate, the Catholic martyr, lived for a time in Pickering. He was hanged, drawn and quartered in York in 1679.

===Early Modern===
Pickering prospered as a market town and agricultural centre. It had watermills and several inns and was a centre for mail coach traffic and trade. At this time the beck was an open sewer and it remained so until the early part of the 20th century.

Many townspeople adoptioned Non-conformist religious sects and were visited by John Wesley on several occasions, the first in 1764 and the last in 1790. The Quakers held meetings in a cottage long before they built their Meeting House in Castlegate in 1793. In 1789 the first Congregational Church was built in Hungate and for several years following 1793 a private residence was licensed for divine worship by protestant dissenters. The Pickering Methodist Circuit was formed in 1812.

===19th century===
Non-conformism flourished in Pickering during the 19th century and meeting houses and chapels were enlarged. There were both Wesleyan and Anglican schools in the town from the middle of the century.

The Whitby and Pickering Railway was opened in May 1836. At first the carriages and wagons were horse drawn but steam locomotives were used from 1847. The Forge Valley Line ran from 1882 to 1950, connecting Pickering to the Whitby–Scarborough line.
The local Health Board (the forerunner of the Urban District Council) was formed in 1863. A Gas and Water Company provided gaslight and piped drinking water. The shop fronts were closed in and glass windows were used to display goods for sale.

===20th century===
At the 1901 census, Pickering had 3,491 people and by 1911 this had risen to 3,674 who were living in 784 households. There were more than 60 shops. In the early 20th century the growth of non-conformist religious sects, particularly Methodism, generated a political spirit of Liberalism and Pickering built a great Liberal tradition.

In 1901 the Catholic priest Fr Edward Bryan came to the town and established a school, parish and, in 1911, St Joseph&#x27;s Church, the work of the architect Leonard Stokes. It contains a font by the celebrated sculptor Eric Gill.

In 1922 an old mill was converted to the Memorial Hall in memory of the Pickering men killed in the First World War. This hall, now modernised, serves as a community centre. The Castle Cinema was built in 1937 in Burgate. Electricity had arrived a few years earlier.

The years from 1920 to 1950 saw a decline in Pickering&#x27;s role as an agricultural market town and the population fell from a peak of 4,193 in 1951 to 4,186 in 1961. The closure of the railway in 1965 under the Beeching axe was a blow to the area. 

The economy of the town saw a turn around in the following decades with the greater mobility of the working population and a rise in tourism due to increasing car ownership. Tourism is a major occupation since the reopening of the North Yorkshire Moors Railway as a restored steam railway and the filming of the television series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; on the moors. In 1991 the population was 6,269.

==Governance==
The Member of the UK Parliament is Kevin Hollinrake (Conservative).

Until the 2010 general election Pickering was in the Ryedale constituency but due to boundary changes was moved to the new Thirsk and Malton constituency.

There are 2 electoral wards in Pickering (east and west). Their cumulative population is equal to that listed for the Town.

From 1974 until 2023 Pickering was part of the Ryedale district.

Pickering is one of the few places with a Liberal Party councillor, on North Yorkshire Council.

==Geography==

===Situation===

Pickering is situated at the junction of the A170, which links Scarborough with Thirsk, and the A169 linking Malton and Whitby. It occupies a broad strip of land between the Ings and Low Carrs to the south of the main road and a ridge of higher, sloping ground which is surmounted by the castle to the north. It is sited where the older limestone and sandstone rocks of the North York Moors meet the glacial deposits of the Vale of Pickering. The limestone rocks form the hill on which the higher parts of the town and the castle are situated. Pickering Beck is a watercourse that runs north to south through the centre of the town. It rises on the moors and drains southwards through Newton Dale before reaching Pickering. It is prone to flooding at times of exceptional rainfall when areas of town close to the beck become flooded. The town centre lies east of the beck, though the population is almost equally divided between its east and west wards. Pickering has developed around the old Market Place but the majority of houses are now in the residential estates off the main A170 road.

===Physical geography===
To the north of Pickering is the high moorland of the North York Moors, rising from above sea level at its southern edge to over on Urra Moor. It is dissected by a series of south-flowing streams which include Pickering Beck. Most of the moorland consists of Jurassic sandstone with occasional cappings of gritstone on the highest hills.

To the south these rocks are overlaid with oolitic limestone which forms flat-topped tabular hills with an escarpment to the north and gentler slopes to the south. Ice action in the last glaciation deepened pre-existing valleys, and determined the line of the rivers and streams. Newtondale to the north of Pickering was cut by meltwater from ice in Eskdale gouging a deep channel as it flowed southwards to the lake which filled the Vale of Pickering. This lake was blocked by ice and glacial deposits near the coast so it drained through the Kirkham Gorge towards the River Ouse. South of Pickering, extensive marshes have been drained and exploited as fertile agricultural land.

==Climate ==
Located in the northern part of the UK, Pickering has a temperate maritime climate which is dominated by the passage of mid-latitude depressions. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the Gulf Stream makes the region mild for its latitude. The average total annual rainfall is 729 mm with rain falling on 128 days of the year. January is usually the coldest month and December the wettest. The warmest month is August and the driest is February.

==Flooding==

Pickering Beck has a history of flooding, which occurs on average every five years. However, out-of-bank flows are experienced on some sections of the watercourse annually. These areas include Potter Hill and the grassed area upstream of Pickering Bridge. The flood in March 1999 caused widespread damage to the town.
Areas affected were Park Street, Beck Isle, Bridge Street, Potter Hill, The Ropery, Hungate, Vivis Walk and Undercliff. Flooding in 2006 caused extensive damage to properties in the Market Place as well as the above areas.

Since 2007, Pickering has planted trees and built 167 retaining dams above the town to keep back water.

==Demography==
According to the United Kingdom Census 2001 Pickering had a population of 6,846 people in 3,071 households. There were 3,213 males and 3,633 females. The mean age of the population for the East Ward was 45.30 years and for the West Ward it was 43.47 years. Both of these ages are significantly higher than the national mean age of 38.6 years. In the census year 25.39% of Pickering&#x27;s population was over 65 years compared with 15.89% nationally. There were 1,183 people below the age of 16 and 886 over the age of 75. The census for 2011 only showed a marginal difference in population at 6,830.

==Economy==
Pickering has two main shopping areas, Market Place, which is by far the larger, and Eastgate Square, which is a mixed housing and retail development. There is a small supermarket off the Market Place.
There are few large employers in the town. Most people find jobs in retailing, tourism and small industries based in the two industrial development areas at Westgate Carr Road and Thornton Road to the west and east of the town respectively.

Pickering is an important tourist centre and there are banking, insurance and legal services in the town as well as an outdoor market each Monday. In 2008, plans were put forward to build a new supermarket in the area of an old coal yard, and a Lidl supermarket has now been built on the site.

=== Natural gas industry ===
A natural gas processing facility was formerly located in Pickering. The Lockton natural gas field was discovered under the North York Moors National Park by the Home Oil Company of Canada in 1966. It is located at a depth of 5,700 ft (1,740 m) in Middle Magnesian Limestone. The gas is about 94% methane, 3% inert gas with traces of hydrogen sulphide. Recoverable reserves were initially estimated to be 250 billion cubic feet (7 billion m3). In an agreement between the Gas Council and Home Oil/Gas Council Exploration provision was to have been made to use the Lockton gas field for the seasonal storage of natural gas.

==== Facilities ====
To minimise development within the national park area only the gas wells, a field gathering station and underground pipelines were located in the Park. Gas from the gathering station was piped at 1,075 psi (74 bar) via an 18-inch (460 mm) diameter underground pipeline nine miles (14.5 km) to a treatment plant in Outgang Lane on the outskirts of Pickering. Construction of the plant at Pickering started in May 1969 and was operational by August 1971. The total cost of the facilities was £4–£8 million. It employed about 24 people.

==== Operation ====
Hot water from the treatment plant was circulated in small-bore pipes alongside the pipeline to reduce heat losses and potential hydrate formation, an ice-like substance that can cause blockages. At the Pickering treatment plant raw gas was routed through a slug catcher and inlet separator to remove liquid hydrocarbons and water. Gas flowed to two parallel vetrocoke absorbers where it was washed with a counter-current aqueous solution of soda ash and arsenic compounds to convert the hydrogen sulphide to elemental sulphur. Gas then flowed to a hydrocarbon recovery unit where it was chilled to remove further liquid hydrocarbons, the dry sulphur-free gas passed through a British Gas metering station to Feeder No. 6 of the National Transmission System which passes through Pickering. The sulphur-rich solution from the absorbers was routed to oxidiser regenerators where air was bubbled through the solution to remove the sulphur in the form of a froth. The froth was dried in a rotary vacuum filter and heated in an autoclave to allow removal of impurities prior to being stored in tanks at about 130 °C from where it was removed by heated road tanker. The regenerated absorber solution from the oxidisers, together with recovered solution from the vacuum filters, was returned for reuse in the vetrocoke absorbers. Hydrocarbon liquids were routed to condensate stabilizers and then to storage tanks for removal by road tanker.

==== Gas production and closure ====
The original agreement between Home Oil and British Gas was a 15-year contract valued at £27 million for the delivery of per day of gas at standard conditions with a maximum flow of per day. By 1974 aquifer water ingress into the gas reservoir had significantly reduced gas production to about per day. The production and gas treatment facility was permanently shut down in October 1974. Over three years it had produced at standard conditions, only 4.5% of the estimated recoverable reserves.

==== Gas field redevelopment ====
The Lockton gas field is now known as Ebberston Moor. It is licensed to Third Energy. In 2014 Third Energy announced a joint venture with Moorland Energy Limited (MEL) to develop the Ebberston Moor South development. Gas from the existing Ebberston Moor South well will be transported via a new 14-km pipeline to the Knapton Generating Station.

==Culture, media and sport==

There are three theatre venues in the town offering a very wide range of amateur and professional productions. In July the annual Jazz Festival is held in Pickering.

There is a leisure centre, a swimming pool and a modern library and information centre. Sports activities include athletics, football, cricket, badminton and bowls. Pickering is home to Pickering Town F.C., who currently play in Division One North-West of the Northern Premier League, Level 8 of the football league pyramid.

Notable sports-people from the town include, footballing brothers Craig Short and Chris Short, and snooker player Paul Davison.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and BBC North East and Cumbria on BBC One &amp; ITV Yorkshire and ITV Tyne Tees on ITV1. Television signals can be received from either Emley Moor or Bilsdale TV transmitters.

Pickering&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio York, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire and Heart Yorkshire.

Local newspapers are
*&quot;Ryedale Mercury&quot; (weekly)
*&quot;The Scarborough News&quot; (weekly)
*&quot;Evening Press&quot; (daily)
*&quot;Gazette and Herald, (Ryedale)&quot; (weekly)
Notable residents of Pickering have included Dorothy Cowlin who wrote many articles about the area and its people.

==Places of interest==

===Beck Isle Museum===

The Beck Isle Museum is housed in a Regency period residence near the centre of town, adjacent to the Pickering Beck, a stream that flows under a four-arched road bridge. It was here that William Marshall planned England&#x27;s first Agricultural Institute in the early 19th century. The house contains a collection of bygones relating to the rural crafts and living style of Ryedale. The collection is not restricted to a particular period, but aims to reflect local life and customs and trace the developments in social and domestic life during the last 200 years. A selection of photographs from the Sidney Smith collection held in the museum are displayed around the building, particularly in the photography and model rooms. Sidney Smith was born in Pickering. He is thought of as a successor to Frank Meadow Sutcliffe of Whitby. The museum is owned by the Beck Isle Museum Trust and is staffed and operated by volunteers.

===Dalby Forest===

Dalby Forest is on the southern slopes of the North York Moors National Park. The southern part of the forest is divided by valleys creating a &#x27;Rigg and Dale&#x27; landscape whilst to the north, the forest sits on the upland plateau. Although the forest is mostly pine and spruce, there are many broadleaf trees such as oak, beech, ash, alder and hazel in the valleys and on the &#x27;Riggs&#x27;. Clear streams arising as springs run north and south out of the forest which is home to the crossbill and the nightjar. Roe deer abound and badgers, the symbol of the forest, are a common but nocturnal resident. The signs of the past are evidenced in burial mounds, linear earthworks of unknown purpose and the remains of a rabbit warrening industry can be found in the wood. A network of forest roads including the Dalby Forest Drive provide access. The landscape was formed in the last ice age and shaped by the people of the Bronze Age to the present day.

===North York Moors National Park===

The national park authority works to promote enjoyment and encourage understanding of the area by the public and balance it with conservation. This includes producing information and interpretation, managing public rights of way and access areas, car parks and toilets and having a Ranger Service.

===North Yorkshire Moors Railway===

The North Yorkshire Moors Railway is a heritage railway. The line is the second-longest heritage line in the United Kingdom and runs across the moors from Pickering via Levisham, Newton Dale and Goathland to Grosmont. It is run by the North York Moors Historical Railway Trust and operated and staffed by volunteers.
Pickering station has been its terminus since 1965 when the Malton-Pickering route connecting to the York to Scarborough main line was closed. Before the station became a terminus, the double-track railway took up the space now occupied by The Ropery (a road) and the car park to the east. Trains run daily from mid-March to early November and on selected dates through the winter. Trains are mostly steam-hauled; however in some cases heritage diesel engine is used. At the height of the running timetable, trains depart hourly from each station. During the summer months, steam services extend to the seaside town of Whitby. Passenger numbers have topped 350,000 in recent years.

===Pickering Castle===
Pickering Castle is situated at the edge of the moors. It is a classic, well-preserved example of an early motte and bailey castle refortified in stone during the 13th and 14th centuries, centred upon a shell keep crowning an impressive motte. There is an exhibition in the chapel.

==Religion==
===Parish Church===
Pickering Parish Church is at the eastern end of the Market Place and dominates views of Pickering from all directions. It is a Grade I Listed building that dates from the 12th century. It is notable for its mid-15th-century wall paintings, which cover the north and south walls. The wall paintings were covered over at the Reformation, but rediscovered in 1852. They were painted over once more, but were restored in the 1870s. The church is open every day. North of the church at the top of the hill is Pickering Castle, which was built in the late 11th century to defend the area against the Scots and Danes. The sloping Market Place between the church and the beck is lined with two- and three-storey buildings dating from a variety of periods. Most are listed for their historical or architectural interest. This area is the centre of the town&#x27;s main Conservation Area.

Pickering Church has an Anglo-Saxon foundation, but the earliest phases of the present building date to the 12th and 13th centuries, with substantial additions in the 14th and 15th. In 1852 restoration work revealed a series of wall paintings on the north and south walls of the nave. Despite a local and national outcry, the paintings were whitewashed, and only rediscovered and restored in 1876–78. They have been called &quot;the most complete collection of medieval wall paintings in England&quot;.

===Saint Joseph&#x27;s Church===

Saint Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, on Potter Hill, was designed by the architect Leonard Stokes in 1911, on the instructions of the parish priest, Fr Edward Bryan. It contains a stone font by the sculptor Eric Gill, and the portable altar-stone of the 17th-century martyr Blessed Nicholas Postgate; also a fine icon, painted in Rome, of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, and a mosaic of Christ blessing the loaves and fishes by local artist Audrey Murty. Outside the church is a statue of Saint Joseph designed by Peter Paul Pugin, son of Augustus Welby Pugin. The church features in the book &quot;A Glimpse of Heaven&quot; by Christopher Martin (English Heritage 2006).

==Events==

Pickering is host to a War Weekend, which includes parades and soup kitchens. There is also a theatre named Kirk Theatre, which is a popular tourist attraction.

==Transport==

Bus services operated by Yorkshire Coastliner connect to York via Malton, Whitby and Thirsk. The 128 bus route connects to Scarborough and Helmsley, and is operated by East Yorkshire.
There is a town bus which travels a circular route around the town.

The nearest mainline railway station is at Malton, away and the North Yorkshire Moors heritage railway runs seasonal services to Grosmont and Whitby.

Plans to reopen the Pickering–Rillington Junction railway line (connecting to the Scarborough line near Rillington village) have surfaced multiple times but rail reopenings in England are exceptional, and no funds have been secured to rebuild it. If rebuilt, the line would cost £21 million despite being just six miles long. The track does not follow the same corridor as the A169 road. A monorail has been suggested as a cheaper alternative, but this would prevent interoperability of through services from York and Malton to Pickering and Whitby.

<text>Andrew Cash (born January 22, 1962) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and former politician who was the member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto-area riding of Davenport from 2011 to 2015. A member of the New Democratic Party (NDP), Cash grew up in Toronto where he and Charlie Angus founded the Toronto punk band L&#x27;Étranger. In the late 1990s he wrote for the Toronto weekly &quot;Now&quot;.

==Music career==
When L&#x27;Étranger broke up in 1986, Cash signed to Island Records as a solo artist. His first release on the label was a reissue of L&#x27;Étranger&#x27;s last recording, &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;. He released three albums as a solo artist, including &quot;Boomtown&quot;, which appeared on the RPM 100 Top Albums chart in 1989. He had a number of hits, including &quot;Time and Place&quot;, &quot;Boomtown&quot;, &quot;What Am I Gonna Do with These Hands&quot;, &quot;Smile Me Down&quot; and &quot;A Lot of Talk&quot;. In 1993, his album &quot;Hi&quot; was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario.

He then formed the band Ursula, who released the album &quot;Happy to Be Outraged&quot; in 1995. However, that band was not successful, and broke up after just the one album.

Around the same time as Ursula&#x27;s demise, however, his brother Peter Cash also decided to leave his band, Skydiggers. Both available at the same time for the first time in their careers, Andrew and Peter decided to write and record together, and released their debut album as The Cash Brothers, &quot;Raceway&quot;, in 1999.

Since 1999 Cash provided the soundtrack music for various television shows, mostly Canadian. He also wrote for the Toronto-based &quot;Now&quot; magazine. In 2000 he collaborated with Hawksley Workman and Jason Collett on &quot;Chrome Reflection&quot;, an album credited to Bird. In 2007 Cash released his latest solo album &quot;Murder=&quot;.

==Political career==
On October 5, 2009, Cash was nominated as the New Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for the Toronto-area Davenport electoral district, in preparation for the 41st Canadian general election. At the time, the House of Commons was controlled by a Conservative minority government, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, that could fall at any time; in this unpredictable election situation Cash was a candidate for over a year and half.

When the election was called, on March 26, 2011, his main campaign issue was that Davenport&#x27;s incumbent MP, Mario Silva, was not a &quot;full-time&quot; MP. Cash campaigned with two main slogans, &quot;Cash for Toronto&quot; and &quot;Trade your Silva for Cash&quot;, with a focus on &quot;issues of precarious employment, especially with regards to freelancers and people who are working serial contracts.&quot; Near the end of April, both &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspapers started to predict that Cash might win, ending 49 years of continuous Liberal representation for that electoral district. The election campaign concluded on May 2, with the Conservatives gaining enough seats to win a majority government and the NDP enough seats to become Official Opposition. In Davenport, Cash defeated Silva, becoming a caucus colleague of his former bandmate Charlie Angus, who has been the MP for Timmins-James Bay since 2004.

Cash lost his seat in the general election held October 19, 2015, one of many New Democrats who were swept away when the Liberal Party came from third place to form a majority government; Liberal Julie Dzerowicz succeeded him as MP for Davenport. In the 2019 federal election, he attempted to win his seat back, coming second to Dzerowicz.

<text>Miles O&#x27;Keeffe (born June 20, 1954) is an American film and television actor. O&#x27;Keeffe got his first big break playing the title role in the 1981 version of &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;.

==Youth==
O&#x27;Keeffe was born in Ripley, Tennessee. A star football athlete, he attended the United States Air Force Academy and played halfback on the freshman football team in 1972. However, in 1973 he transferred to Mississippi State University under a football scholarship, playing as an offensive lineman. During this time, he bulked up to . Subsequently, he transferred to University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee and became a small college All-American playing both tight end and linebacker.

After studying political science and psychology, O&#x27;Keeffe became a prison counselor in the Tennessee penal system for a year or two where he became manager of playground activities and inmate weightlifting programs. He left for California to play in a semi-professional rugby team before becoming involved with Hollywood.

==Acting career==
Although O&#x27;Keeffe is known for his big break as Tarzan, he is also remembered for his performances in the title role of the first three &quot;Ator&quot; sword and sorcery films produced in Europe in the 1980s. The series gained attention in 1991 after a re-edited version of the second installment, released as &quot;Cave Dwellers&quot;, was lampooned on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;). The episode, which soon became immensely popular among fans, included one of the most-quoted quips in the show&#x27;s history: &quot;How much Keeffe is in this movie anyway?&quot; &quot;&quot;Miles&quot; O&#x27;Keeffe!&quot; Unlike some of &quot;MST3K&#x27;s&quot; subjects (such as Sandy Frank), O&#x27;Keeffe is considered to be a &quot;good sport&quot; and is a fan of the series. He enjoyed the &quot;MST3K&quot; treatment of the film so much that he requested a copy of the episode.

O&#x27;Keeffe gained cult status in the UK between 1999 and 2002 as a result of being targeted by chat show host Graham Norton for prank calls, eventually appearing on the show &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; to great acclaim.

<text>The Dayton Daily News (DDN) is a daily newspaper published in Dayton, Ohio. It is owned by Cox Enterprises, Inc., a privately held global conglomerate headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, with approximately 55,000 employees and $21 billion in total revenue. Its major operating subsidiaries are Cox Communications, Cox Automotive, and Ohio Newspapers (including the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, &quot;Springfield News-Sun&quot; and the &quot;Journal-News&quot; papers).

==Headquarters==
The &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; has its headquarters in the Manhattan Building in downtown Dayton, 601 E. Third St. The newspaper&#x27;s editorial and business offices were moved there in January, 2022. For more than 100 years the paper&#x27;s editorial offices and printing presses were located in downtown Dayton. From 1999 to 2017, the paper was printed at the Print Technology Center near Interstate 75 in Franklin about 15 minutes to the south. In 2017, the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;″s parent company came to an agreement with Gannett for the paper to be printed at Gannett&#x27;s facility in Indianapolis. This resulted in the closure of the Franklin facility.

Ohio Newspapers also publishes two other daily newspapers and websites in Southwest Ohio: &quot;Journal-News&quot; (formerly &quot;The Middletown Journal&quot; and &quot;Hamilton JournalNews&quot;) and the &quot;Springfield News-Sun&quot;. Cox First Media also publishes weekly papers &quot;Today&#x27;s Pulse&quot; and &quot;Oxford Press&quot;, and had published several other weekly papers until CMG Ohio ceased their operations in January 2013, including &quot;The Western Star (Ohio)&quot;, formerly the oldest weekly paper published in the state, the &quot;Pulse-Journal&quot; (Mason-Deerfield Township and West Chester-Liberty Township editions) and the &quot;Fairfield Echo&quot;.

==Merger==
In late 2010, Cox Enterprises merged all of its local media holdings under the CMG Ohio brand and consolidated locations to The Media Center. In early 2020, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management purchased Cox Enterprises&#x27; radio and TV properties and all Cox Media Group Ohio media entities. In March 2020, Cox Enterprises took back ownership of Ohio Newspapers, which included the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;, &quot;Journal-News&quot;, &quot;Springfield News-Sun&quot;, Dayton.com, and related digital brands. As a group they operate under the brand Cox First Media.

==History==

On August 15, 1898, James M. Cox purchased the &quot;Dayton Evening News&quot;. One week later, on August 22, 1898, he renamed it the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot;. In 2023, the Dayton Daily News celebrated 125 years in business.

The paper was founded with the intention of pioneering a new type of journalism, keeping weak ties to politicians and advertisers while seeking objectivity and public advocacy as primary functions. These goals pushed the paper in the direction of valuing the public interest.

A Sunday edition was launched on November 2, 1913. In 1948, Cox purchased two morning papers, &quot;The Journal&quot; and &quot;The Herald&quot;, from the Herrick-Kumler Company. The next year he combined them to form The Journal-Herald.

For the next four decades, &quot;The Journal-Herald&quot; was the conservative morning paper, and the &quot;Dayton Daily News&quot; (which had a larger circulation) was the liberal evening paper. The papers operated newsrooms on separate floors of the same building in downtown Dayton. On September 15, 1986, &quot;The Journal-Herald&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot; were merged to become a morning paper, the Dayton Daily News and Journal-Herald, with both names appearing on the front page. The &quot;Journal-Herald&quot; name last appeared on the paper&#x27;s front-page flag on December 31, 1987.

Cox was the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for U.S. President in the election of 1920, and the city of Dayton has voted for the Democratic candidate in presidential elections ever since. Cox&#x27;s running mate for vice president was Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who was elected president in 1932.

==Recent operations==
The paper was led by Jeff Bruce as editor from 1998 to 2008. Bruce replaced Max Jennings, who retired. When Bruce retired in 2007 Kevin Riley, 44, a graduate of the University of Dayton, was named editor. Riley spent most of his career with the paper, starting as a copy editor and later serving as sports editor, Internet general manager, and publisher of the &quot;Springfield News-Sun&quot; in Springfield, Ohio. He was promoted from deputy editor.

In 2010, Riley was named editor of the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; and that paper&#x27;s editor, Julia Wallace, under whose leadership the AJC won Pulitzer Prizes in 2006 and 2007, moved to Dayton to become Senior Vice President of news and programming for CMG Ohio heading a new combined newspaper, television and radio newsroom. She was soon after named the first female publisher and retired in 2016. In 2011, Jana Collier was promoted from managing editor to editor-in-chief of CMG Ohio and was responsible for content and operations for all daily and weekly papers. Collier is also the first woman to be editor-in-chief of the Dayton Cox newspaper organization. In March 2020, Jana Collier was named publisher of the newly formed Ohio Newspapers brand. Upon her retirement at the end of 2022, Suzanne Klopfenstein was named the new publisher and assumed her role in the beginning of 2023. Klopfenstein has 30 years of media experience, including serving as the senior director of sales for Cox First Media. Ashley Bethard became editor and chief content officer in January, 2022.

On March 5, 2023, the newspaper announced that, due to cost issues, starting on May 6, it would no longer produce printed newspapers on Saturdays. Digital products, including its online newspaper (branded as ePaper which is available online or in the company&#x27;s app), would continue to be published on Saturdays .

==Notable employees==
In 1998, reporters Russell Carollo and Jeff Nesmith won the Pulitzer Prize for their reporting on dangerous flaws and mismanagement in the military health care system, a series very relevant to its readership because of the presence of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in neighboring Greene County.

The paper is the home of cartoonist Mike Peters, who draws the &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot; strip and won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1981, and columnist Dale Huffman, who had written a daily metro column every day for more than eight years before beginning a hiatus on January 30, 2008, after he was diagnosed with kidney cancer.

In 1988, &quot;Daily News&quot; publisher Dennis Shere was fired by Cox Newspapers because he rejected a health lecture advertisement by homosexual groups. Shere cited his &quot;Christian perspective&quot; in declining to print the ad. The Southern Baptist Convention subsequently passed a resolution calling on &quot;all media to refuse advertising that promotes homosexuality or any other lifestyle that is destructive to the family&quot;. The resolution said Shere was fired for his &quot;commitment to defend traditional moral and family values&quot;. The company responded that it was defending freedom of expression for all people, saying &quot;We cannot compromise on the constitutional issue of equal access to the press&quot;.

<text>Walter Graham Arader III is an American art dealer, focusing on rare maps, prints and natural history watercolors.

==Biography==
===Personal life===
He graduated from Yale University in 1972. He played No. 1 singles on the varsity squash team for three years, and spent much of the rest of his time at Yale exploring the map holdings of the Sterling Memorial Library and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The curator of the Yale map collection, Alexander O. Vietor, became his mentor. He married Vallijeanne Hartrampf in 1983. His son, Walter Graham Arader IV, is married to British fashion writer Tatiana Hambro.

===Career===
Shortly after graduation, he began a short-lived career as a tree surgeon. Two years later, his father, a Philadelphia businessman, former Pennsylvania Secretary of Commerce and map collector, lent his son one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and Arader began to travel the antique-show circuit.

He established his business in 1974, focusing on rare maps. In &quot;The Island of Lost Maps&quot;, author Miles Harvey credits him with transforming what had been an &quot;insular realm of aficionados,&quot; giving maps &quot;unprecedented visibility, not only as investments... but as mass-media artifacts.&quot; Arader has brought a similar acumen to the sale of natural history prints, books, and watercolors, and he is the largest dealer of John James Audubon&#x27;s highly prized double-elephant folio prints from The Birds of America.

In 1981, he introduced the Arader Grading System to determine the value and significance of rare maps, prints, and books. This system evaluates items based on their conceptual importance, aesthetic quality, condition, and rarity. He also invented a method of selling by syndication, a form of retailing with an added touch of gambling. For a fixed amount, clients purchase shares in the distribution of a set of prints or watercolors. By process of lottery, numbers are drawn to determine the order in which clients make a selection. Such a method was used by Arader in the fall of 1985, when he bought the original watercolors for Pierre-Joseph Redouté’s masterpiece, &quot;Les Liliacées&quot;. Sotheby&#x27;s had planned to auction the flower watercolors one-by-one, but Arader created one of his syndicates and in a remarkable coup purchased the whole group with a single unchallenged bid of five million dollars. Each of his investors acquired four watercolors for a share price of $63,250. One of Arader&#x27;s biggest clients was Steve Jobs, who obsessively collected Redouté roses.

He was profiled in the October 24, 2011 issue of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. He is discussed by Sarah Vowell in episode 86 of &quot;This American Life&quot;, and in her book &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot;, and by Simon Garfield in his book, &quot;On The Map&quot;.

Arader currently owns galleries in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, New York City, NY, and St. Helena, California.

<text>Fatima Whitbread, (&#x27;Vedad; born 3 March 1961) is a British retired javelin thrower. She broke the world record with a throw of in the qualifying round of the 1986 European Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, and became the first British athlete to set a world record in a throwing event. Whitbread went on to win the European title that year, and took the gold medal at the 1987 World Championships. She is also a two-time Olympic medallist, winning bronze at the 1984 Summer Olympics and silver at the 1988 Summer Olympics. She won the same medals, respectively, in the Commonwealth Games of 1982 and 1986.

After a difficult early childhood, Fatima Vedad was adopted by the family of Margaret Whitbread, a javelin coach. Whitbread won the 1977 English Schools&#x27; Athletics Championships intermediate title, and was selected for the 1978 Commonwealth Games, where she finished sixth. The following year, she took gold at the 1979 European Athletics Junior Championships. During her career, she had a well-publicised rivalry with another British javelin athlete, Tessa Sanderson. Whitbread&#x27;s later career was affected by a long-term shoulder injury, which she believed dated back to her world record throw in 1986. The 1990 UK Athletics Championships was the last event in which she participated, sustaining a further shoulder injury there. In 1992 she formally retired from competition.

She was named the Sports Writers&#x27; Association Sportswoman of the Year in 1986 and 1987. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1987 Birthday Honours, for services to athletics. She was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and received the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2023 in recognition of her triumph over the adversity of her childhood, and her continued work on behalf of other children in care environments.

In later years, Whitbread has appeared on several television programmes, including &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in 2011 and 2023, in which she finished in third place both times.

==Early life==
Fatima Vedad was born on 3 March 1961 in Stoke Newington, London, to an unmarried Turkish Cypriot mother and Greek Cypriot father. She said &quot;I was abandoned as a baby and left to die in our flat.&quot; After being rescued, severely malnourished, &quot;I spent the next 14 years living in institutions, among other traumatised children&quot;, occasionally being left in the care of her abusive biological mother. In a 2003 interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, she said, &quot;it was a nightmare of a childhood and it was only because I loved sport so much that I got through it and met my true [adoptive] mother.&quot;
Vedad started throwing the javelin aged 11. According to her account, she had taken up an interest in track and field events after being inspired by the myth of Atalanta, &quot;whom no man could outrun except by cheating, and whose javelin killed a terrible monster&quot;; and by Mary Peters, who won the gold medal at the 1972 Summer Olympics&#x27; women&#x27;s pentathlon. Vedad met javelin thrower David Ottley at a stadium and asked him if she could use his javelin. He asked her to wait until the coach arrived. The coach was Margaret Whitbread, a physical education teacher at a local school, whom Vedad had previously met when Whitbread refereed a netball match that she played in. After discovering that Vedad stayed at a children&#x27;s home, Margaret Whitbread passed on some boots and a javelin from a girl who had retired from the event. Three years later, Vedad was adopted by Margaret Whitbread and her family. She spent her teenage years in Chadwell St Mary, Essex, where she attended the Torells School in nearby Grays.

==Career==
===Early career===
Whitbread won the English Schools&#x27; Athletics Championships intermediate title in 1977, and set a national intermediate record of in winning the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) women&#x27;s championship the following month. She placed sixth in the javelin throw at the 1978 Commonwealth Games, throwing . Whitbread won gold in the javelin event at the 1979 European Athletics Junior Championships, throwing . She was selected for the 1980 Summer Olympics event, but, achieving only
, she failed to qualify for the final. At the 1982 Commonwealth Games, Whitbread took the bronze medal, throwing , which was behind champion Sue Howland, from Australia.
Having finished behind fellow British competitor Tessa Sanderson in a run of 18 competitions, Whitbread finally defeated her rival with a throw of to win the UK Athletics Championship in 1983, Whitbread won the silver medal at the inaugural World Championships in 1983, having narrowly qualified for the final. She led throughout the final until Tiina Lillak bettered her mark with her last throw of the contest. A few days before the 1984 Summer Olympics, Whitbread had a stomach operation but was still able to travel to the Games and compete. She finished in the bronze medal position, with , and Sanderson () won gold. Lillak, who had a stress fracture in her right foot, won the silver medal. After the result, Whitbread commented that &quot;I am so disappointed... I was not right on the night.&quot;

At the 1986 Commonwealth Games in July, Whitbread broke the Games record twice during her first three throws, and led with a distance of , before Sanderson achieved and won. Whitbread sat down crying on the field after the result for around 30 minutes. After the medal ceremony, she commented, while still visibly upset: &quot;12 years of hard work. Still no [gold] medal... I&#x27;ve waited two long years since [the 1984 Summer Olympics]. And now I&#x27;m humiliated.&quot; Sanderson, who had placed behind Whitbread in all of their seven post-1984 Olympics meetings before the Games, said &quot;I don&#x27;t mind losing to Fatima in the smaller competitions, but not in the big ones.&quot;

===World record, and European and World championship wins===
The following month, Whitbread broke the javelin world record with a throw of in the qualifying round of the 1986 European Championships, more than 2 m further than the record set by Petra Felke of East Germany the previous year. She was the first British athlete to set a world record in a throwing event. Felke led for the first three rounds, before Whitbread produced a throw of in the fourth round, and in the fifth round to win her first major championship gold. Whitbread later wrote that &quot;All the years of training had finally come to something... I went on my lap of honour... Spontaneously, I wiggled my hips in happiness, a victory wiggle.&quot; The record was beaten by Felke in July 1987 with a throw of .

Whitbread qualified for the final of the 1987 World Championships in second place behind Felke. Her throw of was, at the time, the third-longest ever, and won her the title ahead of Felke. Sanderson was fourth. Her celebratory wiggles after defeating Felke in the World and European event became well known in the UK. She was voted winner of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 1987. David Powell wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;, that &quot;To that practiced smile, she has added the &#x27;Whitbread wiggle&#x27;. She is succeeding in bringing personality to her event in the same way that Willie Banks did to the triple jump.&quot;

===Later career===
In the months leading up to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Whitbread suffered from several ailments: a shoulder injury, boils, glandular fever and problems with her gums. Whitbread won the silver medal behind Felke, with a throw that, although her best of the season, was some four metres less than her rival. Whitbread commented &quot;If I had to be beaten, I am glad it was by Petra.&quot;

Whitbread&#x27;s later career was affected by a long-term shoulder injury, which she believed dated back to her world record throw in 1986. The 1990 UK Athletics Championships was the last event that she participated in, and she sustained a further shoulder injury there. In 1992 she formally retired from competition.

===Rivalry with Tessa Sanderson===
Alan Hubbard wrote in a 1990 article in &quot;The Observer&quot; about Whitbread and Sanderson that &quot;their hate-hate relationship has been one of the most enduring in British sport,&quot; lasting almost a decade. In 2009, Tom Lamont commented in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;Whitbread and Sanderson were always uneasy rivals and the enmity that developed during their overlapping careers became as famous as their achievements, and seems to survive in their retirement.&quot; Hubbard cited Sanderson&#x27;s perception that Whitbread received preferential treatment from the British Amateur Athletic Board. The Board&#x27;s promotions officer, Andy Norman, who had a role in setting British athletes&#x27; fees, was a family friend of Whitbread and her mother. In 1985, Whitbread often participated in international events but Sanderson took part in only one in the season ending in June 1985. Sanderson claimed that this was because she lacked supporters in the meetings where representatives were determined; she said that &quot;Fatima has Andy Norman looking after her in meetings ... and, of course, her mother, Margaret, is the national event coach&quot;. In 1987, Sanderson threatened to boycott six official athletics events, for which she was to be paid £1,000 each by British Athletics compared to Whitbread&#x27;s £10,000. Sanderson also objected to the Whitbreads&#x27; endorsement of Howland, who competed at the 1990 Commonwealth Games after a two-year doping suspension, since Howland was Australian, and Sanderson felt they should have supported British athletes instead.

During their respective careers, Whitbread gained one world and one European title; Sanderson won an Olympic and three Commonwealth golds. In all, Sanderson placed higher in 27 of the 45 times that they faced each other in competition, although Whitbread had the better results of the pair from 1984 to 1987. In 1993, coach Peter Lawler favourably compared Whitbread&#x27;s technique to Sanderson&#x27;s, writing in &quot;IAAF New Studies in Athletics&quot; that &quot;the alignments of Whitbread and [Mick] Hill are as straight as a cricket text book&#x27;s bat. Whitbread perfected the turning on to the shaft while Sanderson often sagged through the delivery.&quot;

==Personal life==
Whitbread wrote in her 2012 autobiography that she began a personal relationship with Andy Norman shortly after his divorce in 1986. In 1997, Whitbread married Norman in Copthorne, West Sussex. The couple, who had a son together, divorced in 2006. Norman died of a heart attack in 2007.

Whitbread has published two autobiographies written with Adrianne Blue, &quot;Fatima: The Autobiography of Fatima Whitbread&quot; in 1988, and &quot;Survivor: The Shocking and Inspiring Story of a True Champion&quot; in 2012.

Whitbread is a Christian but, in her own words, &quot;not devout.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
Whitbread was runner-up to Nigel Mansell in the 1986 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards, and won the title the following year. She was named the Sports Writers&#x27; Association Sportswoman of the Year in 1986 and 1987. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1987 Birthday Honours, for services to athletics. Whitbread received the 2023 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award, for &quot;outstanding achievement in the face of adversity&quot;.

==In media==
Whitbread has been a guest on television programmes including &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; (on which she first appeared in 1984), &quot;The Little and Large Show&quot; (1987 and 1988) and &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot; (2012). In 1989, she was one of the celebrities with experience of fostering or adoption who took part in &quot;Find a Family&quot; on ITV. The series featured the celebrities&#x27; own reflections, and also highlighted specific children, inviting viewers to contact the programme if they were interesting in fostering or adopting them.

In January 1995 Whitbread was interviewed by Andrew Neil, on his one-on-one show &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot; on Channel 4 which included discussion of Cliff Temple&#x27;s suicide. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nancy Banks-Smith described how Whitbread had &quot;stonewalled with stoicism and without sweating&quot; and been unclear in her answers about this. Whitbread also spoke about her unhappiness at how Ben Johnson had been treated after being found doping with steroids. Neil&#x27;s treatment of Whitbread attracted viewer complaints.

She was a featured &quot;masked celebrity&quot; on &quot;Celebrity Wrestling&quot; in 2005, and lost her bout against Victoria Silvstedt.

In November 2011, Whitbread took part in the ITV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; Whitbread and fellow campmate Antony Cotton left on 2 December 2011, placing her third. One of the challenges on the show involved her wearing a helmet containing about 7,500 cockroaches. The segment was halted after one of the insects crawled up her nose. It was removed by flushing it out through her mouth with water.

In 2012, she was a regular fitness expert appearing on &quot;This Morning&quot;. Later that year, the stand-alone documentary &quot;Fatima Whitbread: Growing Up in Care&quot; featured Whitbread&#x27;s reflections on her own troubled childhood, and her conversations with others who had experienced serious problems from their parent and problems with the UK care system. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, David Stubbs wrote &quot;More emotional than forensic, this is compulsory viewing nonetheless.&quot; In 2020, she trekked the Sultans Trail for BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrimage: Road to Istanbul&quot;.

In 2023, she appeared in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;, placing third again after losing the penultimate trial to camp mates Jordan Banjo and Myleene Klass.
