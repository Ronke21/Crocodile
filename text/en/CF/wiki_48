<text>Albion Rovers Football Club is a semi-professional football team from Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. They play in the Lowland Football League, the fifth tier of the Scottish football league system.

Founded in October 1882, the club joined the Scottish Football League in 1903 and, other than four seasons during the First World War when the second tier was abolished, maintained their league membership until they were relegated in the 2022–23 season. During this time, they won three lower division league titles – in 1933–34, 1988–89 and 2014–15; and been promoted on three other occasions – 1937–38, 1947–48 and 2010–11.

==Ownership==

Albion Rovers FC is a private limited company owned by its shareholders. Some half of its shares, which were first issued in 1919, have over many years become dormant, the original owners having died and the shares&#x27; inheritors becoming untraceable. The biggest single shareholder with some 7,000 shares (more than 20% of the non-dormant shares) is Anton Fagan, a full-time employee of the Scottish Football Association. The next largest shareholder has around 2,000 shares (6%).

==History==

===Early years===

Albion Rovers were formed in 1882 through a merger of two Coatbridge sides Albion FC and Rovers FC, and played at Meadow Park from that year. After reaching six local cup finals in their first nine years and losing all of them, Rovers finally won a trophy in their tenth year by defeating Royal Albert 5–2 in the Larkhall Charity Cup Final, and followed this up eight days later with a 5–3 triumph over Airdrieonians in the Airdrie Charity Cup Final.

The club joined the Scottish Football League Second Division in 1903 following a small expansion in numbers. Rovers&#x27; greatest success in the pre-war era was winning the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1913–14 by defeating Dundee Hibernian 3–0 in the Final at Tynecastle. In 1915, the League scrapped their second tier and Rovers were forced to join the Western Football League. Rovers re-joined the League after the War and moved to their current Cliftonhill home. The first match at the ground took place on 25 December 1919 v St Mirren.

===Jimmy Conlin===
A fast and tricky winger on the field, and a colourful character off it, Jimmy Conlin played for Rovers from 1901 to 1904, helping the club win the Scottish Combination Championship in 1901–02. He was transferred to Bradford City and played for England (the country of his birth) against Scotland at Hampden Park in 1906. He was subsequently transferred to Manchester City for £1,000, which made him the most expensive footballer in the world at the time, jointly with Alf Common.

===1920 Cup Final===
Rovers finished bottom of the League in 1919–20, but enjoyed possibly their finest hour when they defeated Rangers in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, before losing 3–2 to Kilmarnock in the Final. Local folklore has it that Rovers&#x27; goalkeeper Joe Shortt had to be bailed out of police custody on the morning of the Final and that his subsequent performance at Hampden had been affected by the lingering effects of his alcohol consumption the night before.

Rovers remained a top-flight side even after the return of the Second Division until their relegation in 1923. It was during this period that John &quot;Jock&quot; White became Rovers&#x27; only international, appearing for Scotland in a match against Wales. The club remained in the Second Division until the 1933–34 season when they took the title by a point from Dunfermline Athletic. Of the five seasons immediately before the Second World War Rovers spent all but one of them as a top-flight side. They took part in the Emergency Western League during the 1939–40 season before transferring to the Southern Football League. Despite struggling from time to time to get a full side out, the Rovers managed to survive the war in good shape.

===Post-war===
It would be 1946–47 before the League returned full-time and Rovers, whose 16th-place finish in 1939 would not normally have led to relegation, were assigned to the &#x27;B&#x27; Division in a restructuring of the League set-up. To add to their problems the celebrated wing partnership of Willie Findlay and Johnny McIlhatton was broken up when the former departed for Rangers and the latter to Everton. One feature of the McIlhatton transfer was a friendly match between the clubs at Goodison Park in September 1946, which the Toffees won 6–3.

With Jock Stein in the line-up (Stein played 215 matches for Rovers from 1942 to 1950), Rovers managed to clinch promotion in 1947–48 if only for one season, amassing just eight points in the First Division in 1948–49 and an immediate return to the &#x27;B&#x27; Division. This was effectively the end of the Rovers as a major force in Scottish football as they became stuck in the Second Division for many years, only occasionally challenging at the top end of the league.

===1960s and 1970s===
Nevertheless, there were enough moments to brighten up the lives of the Cliftonhill faithful – such as an 8–2 League Cup defeat of local rivals Airdrieonians in 1965–66 and a run to the League Cup quarter-finals in 1973–74, again defeating Airdrie along the way. Rovers took a 2–0 lead in the first leg against Kilmarnock, but lost the 2nd leg 5–2 to go out 5–4 on aggregate.

Notable players from this era included midfielder Tony Green, possibly the only player to make the Hall of Fame at three clubs (Rovers, Blackpool and Newcastle United), and goalkeeper Jim Brown, who moved on to Chesterfield, and then Sheffield United – both players were capped for Scotland. And no team has ever been able to put together a more spicy trio than Currie, Sage and Rice, who appeared in Rovers&#x27; sides of the early 1970s.

Changes brought in for the 1975–76 season saw Rovers placed in the new Second Division, which was now the third tier of the Scottish League.

===1980s and 1990s===
Rovers made some headlines for reasons other than their on-field performances when, in 1983, confectioners Tunnock&#x27;s became the club&#x27;s shirt sponsor and the appearance of the shirt was altered to mimic the gold wrapper with red diagonal stripes of a caramel wafer bar the company produced, making Rovers one of the very few clubs to wear a kit inspired by a biscuit wrapper. In 1986 a book covering the club&#x27;s history, &quot;The Boys From the &quot;Brig&quot;&quot; by Robin Marwick, was published.

Players such as Vic Kasule and Bernie Slaven brought some flamboyancy to Rovers in the mid-1980s, and in the 1988–89 season the club were Second Division champions. The First Division stay was again to last just one season and Rovers subsequently finished bottom of the bottom division several times during the 1990s.

===Third Division===
Rovers found themselves in the newly created Scottish Football League Third Division, finishing last in its inaugural season of 1994–95. In an attempt to cut costs, the number of full-timers was substantially reduced and the club&#x27;s board took a decision to sell Cliftonhill and groundshare with Airdrieonians. A &#x27;Rescue The Rovers&#x27; fan campaign mobilised shareholders to defeat the proposal and oust the Board at an Emergency General Meeting, a prescient move as it turned out given Airdrie&#x27;s struggle to maintain the costs of running their new ground and subsequent liquidation.

Following another last place finish in 1999–2000 there was an attempt to change the club&#x27;s fortunes. The team went full-time, although many of the full-time players were youths to whom the club gave employment under a government scheme. Rovers went into the last day of the season in 2001–02 and 2002–03 with a chance of promotion, only to miss out both times. The full-time experiment proved too expensive and had to be dismantled to keep the club&#x27;s costs under control.

Another attempt by directors in 2004 to sell Cliftonhill and move to Airdrie was defeated by shareholders, despite scare stories put about by the board that the football authorities would not allow the club to play at the ground for much longer. Rovers have remained at Cliftonhill to this day and the famous old ground reached its centenary in 2019. A centenary exhibition was held at Coatbridge&#x27;s Summerlee Museum to mark the occasion.

===125th anniversary===
2006–07 saw the club celebrate its 125th anniversary and various events took place and souvenirs produced. A one-off kit that combined the original blue colours with the yellow adopted during the 1960s was introduced. The club also progressed to the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, their first semi-final since 1921, a match they lost 4–1 to Ross County in Dingwall.

===Two promotions===
Impressive late season form in 2010–11 saw Rovers finish 2nd and go on to gain promotion, beating Queens Park in the play-off semi final and Annan Athletic in the final. In memorable scenes, hundreds of Rovers fans invaded the Annan pitch at the final whistle and joined in prolonged celebrations with the players.

The 2011–12 season, Rovers&#x27; first in a higher division in 22 seasons, had its ups and downs. A 7–2 victory over Airdrie United was the highlight for most Rovers fans but the team finished 9th in the table and found themselves in the play-offs for a second successive season – this time to stay up rather than go up. Rovers triumphed again in even more dramatic circumstances than the previous season. A Scott Chaplain last minute winner against Elgin City in the semi-final and penalties win over Stranraer in the final meant that Rovers had gone up, and stayed up, for the first time since the 1930s. Relegation came again in 2012–13 but Rovers won the 2014–15 League Two title with a 3–2 win over Clyde at Broadwood. They spent three seasons in League One before relegation back to the 4th tier after finishing bottom in 2017–18.

===Run to Scottish Cup Quarter Final===
In 2013–14, Rovers best cup run in decades saw them reach the quarter final against Rangers, having beaten local rivals top flight Motherwell 1–0 in the fourth round. After a controversial late equaliser at Ibrox, Rovers were held to a 1–1 draw but lost 2–0 in the replay.

===League Two and Lowland League===
Rovers struggled following relegation to League 2 in 2018, fighting to avoid the &#x27;Club 42’ play-off position in most seasons thereafter. They made a remarkable escape under manager Kevin Harper in 2018–19 and were in 9th place (one place above the play-off drop zone) when football was suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19. However, in season 2022–23 Rovers finished bottom of the league and faced The Spartans, losing 2–1 over two legs, and were relegated to the Lowland Football League for 2023–24.

===Scottish record penalty shoot-out ===
On 14 October 2020, Rovers set a Scottish record for consecutive penalties scored in a shootout, beating Stranraer 15–14 in a League Cup group match. The teams between them set a record of 28 consecutive penalties scored to take the score to 14–14, before Stranraer missed their 15th kick and Rovers scored theirs.

<doc id="954726" wikidata="Q2594562" url="?curid=954726" title="Kevin Murphy (actor)">
<text>Kevin Wagner Murphy (born November 3, 1956) is an American actor and writer best known as the voice and puppeteer of Tom Servo on the Peabody Award-winning comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. Murphy also records audio commentary tracks with Michael J. Nelson and Bill Corbett for Nelson&#x27;s RiffTrax website.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Murphy was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of River Forest, Illinois. After graduating from the University of Utah with a BA in journalism, he attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, studying stage, film and television directing, and earned a Master of Arts degree. 

After graduation he worked on the staff of Madison PBS affiliate WHA-TV. Murphy&#x27;s production work on Jim Mallon&#x27;s 1987 horror film, &quot;Blood Hook&quot;, led to Murphy following Mallon to Minneapolis television station KTMA, where &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; began airing the following year.

===&quot;MST3K&quot; era===
For eleven years, Murphy was a writer for &quot;MST3K&quot;; for nine of those years, he also voiced and operated the robot Tom Servo, replacing original cast member J. Elvis Weinstein. After taking over the role of Servo, an anonymous person sent him a banner that read &quot;I Hate Tom Servo&#x27;s New Voice&quot;. Flattered by the enormous amount of effort taken to heckle him, Murphy hung the banner in his office for over a year. During the final three years of the series, he additionally portrayed Professor Bobo, an English-speaking mountain gorilla in the style of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;.

After the end of &quot;MST3K&quot;, Murphy spent the year 2001 going to a movie every day and wrote a book about this experience, entitled &quot;A Year at the Movies: One Man&#x27;s Filmgoing Odyssey&quot;. During his year at the movies, Murphy samples theatres from small-town boxes to urban megaplexes, attempts (and rejects) a theatre-food diet, suffers a kidney stone, visits both the Sundance and Cannes film festivals, sneaks Thanksgiving dinner into a showing of &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and records all of these experiences, both good and bad. His feat – viewing over four hundred films on four continents – was mentioned in &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;.

===RiffTrax era===

Since 2006, Murphy has joined Michael J. Nelson on many audio commentaries for Nelson&#x27;s RiffTrax movie-riffing website, along with MST3K alumnus Bill Corbett. He was notably absent from Joel Hodgson&#x27;s &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; series, which included most of the original cast of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;.

During a 2008 interview, Hodgson was asked if Murphy harbored any sort of animosity towards him or the &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; members; he responded: &quot;I can&#x27;t really speak for him. We saw him at ComicCon, and we did the Mystery Science Theater 20th anniversary panel, and he seemed totally happy to be there, willing to be there, but he&#x27;s doing RiffTrax.&quot;

Murphy also did not appear in a 2008 reunion sketch, which otherwise featured all of the original cast members from the Comedy Central era reprising their roles (excluding Weinstein). 

== Other work ==

In 2013, Murphy recorded a voice for the computer game &quot;Tesla Effect&quot;, playing Smart Alex, a Siri-like AI assistant that serves as a sidekick to the main character and heckles the player&#x27;s failures.

===Personal life===
Murphy resides in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area with his wife, Jane.

<text>A parachutist badge (or parachutist brevet) is a badge awarded by armed forces or paramilitary forces (e.g. certain law enforcement agencies) of many states to personnel who have received parachute training and completed the required number of jumps. It is difficult to assess which country was the first to introduce such an award.

==France==

===Army===

The School of Airborne Troops oversees different courses.

====Military Parachute Trainee====
The Military Parachute Trainee Badge (French: &quot;Brevet de préparation militaire parachutiste (PMP)&quot;) is a badge created in 1965 and aimed at reservists and national service personnel. The laureates of the badge could serve in airborne units and eventually train at the Airborne School for the Military Parachute Badge in a short course. Since the end of conscription in France, the PMP Badge is awarded to prospective soldiers in airborne units after a 4-week course.

====Military Parachute Initiation====

The Military Parachuting Initiation Badge (French: &quot;Brevet d&#x27;initiation au parachutisme militaire (BIPM)&quot;) was created in 1980 and aimed at military personnel outside of airborne units. It was awarded for four daytime jumps. The BIMP course was closed in 1994 for French personnel, but the badge is still awarded to members of foreign militaries after a short course at the Airborne School.

====Military Parachute====

The Military Parachute Badge (French: &quot;Brevet parachutiste militaire (BPM)&quot;) is the standard course for every personnel in airborne units and all graduates of the école spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. It was created in 1946 and is awarded for six jumps, three daylight standard jumps, one daylight jump with the reserve parachute, one night jump without equipment, one night jump with full gear and equipment.

====Parachute Monitor====

The Parachutist Monitor Badge (French: &quot;Brevet de moniteur parachutiste&quot;) is awarded to long-serving NCO in airborne units. Its graduates can teach the basics of parachute jumping to trainees, act as technical advisors on parachute matters and be jumpmasters both in units or at the Airborne Schools.

====Operational Free Fall====

The Operational Free Fall Badge (French: &quot;Brevet de chuteur opérationnel&quot;) is awarded to graduates of long courses in Military Free Fall techniques. All graduates must have at least finished the Military Parachute Course and have some years of experience in airborne units.

== Poland ==

The Polish &quot;Odznaka Spadochronowa&quot; was based on the previous award called the &quot;Odznaka Pilota Wojskowego&quot;, or &quot;Military Pilot Badge&quot;. It was first introduced by notable Polish sculptor Władysław Gruberski in 1919 and was accepted shortly afterwards as the sign of all the pilots of the Polish Air Forces. The badge featured an eagle with wide spread wings, holding a laurel wreath in his bill.

In 1941, after the creation of the UK-trained 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, a similar symbol was adopted as the sign of all Polish paras. It featured a diving silver eagle. The symbol was also adopted by the cichociemni and nowadays is used by all branches of the Polish Army. Also, the Polish special unit GROM adopted a modified version of the symbol as its emblem. It is commonly (though informally) referred to as &quot;gapa&quot; (diving Eagle).

==Singapore==
The Silver Wings is awarded upon successful completion of the Basic Airborne Course conducted by the Parachute Training Wing, School of Commandos. First awarded to the pioneering batch of 27 NSFs from 2nd Company, 1st Commando Battalion (1 CDO BN) of the Commandos formation, it comprises a pair of outspread wings on both wigs of a deployed parachute, with the word &quot;SINGAPURA&quot; below the canopy. With the design sanctioned by 1 CDO BN&#x27;s Commanding Officer, Tan Kim Peng Clarence, it is differentiated by a crimson velvet backing for Commandos, while those of the Commando Parachute Jump Instructors have a golden velvet backing. Non-Commandos wear the badge without any backing.

==Spain==
The Spanish Air Force instituted in 1946 their own uniform regulations, which included the parachutist badge known as Rokiski, awarded to all the soldiers who completed the Basic Airborne Course in the Paratrooper Military School (Escuela Militar de Paracaidismo) &quot;Méndez Parada&quot; along with the title of Paratrooper Hunter (Cazador Paracaidista).
Personnel with this badge can only wear it while in service in a paratrooper unit or if the &quot;permanent status&quot; is awarded. 
Permanent status is granted to military personnel if:

*Has been 2 or more years in a paratrooper unit.
*A service related injury prevent him/her from staying 2 or more years in a paratrooper unit.
*Has jumped at least 3 times in enemy territory in a conflict zone.

==United Kingdom==
==United States==
The United States Parachutist Badge (also commonly referred to as &quot;Jump Wings&quot;) is a military badge of the United States Armed Forces.

After making five more jumps in a jump billet, members of the Navy and Marine Corps are authorized to wear the gold wings of Naval and Marine parachutists in lieu of their initial award of the Basic Parachutist Badge. There are three versions of the Parachutist Badge. The United States Coast Guard is the only service which does not issue a Parachutist Badge and does not have personnel serving on jump status; however, Coast Guard members are entitled to receive the Parachutist Badge of another service if the proper training was received. The badge is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces personnel upon completion of the United States Army Airborne School Basic Airborne Course or freefall parachute training at the United States Air Force Academy.

If awarded, Army parachutists who meet the qualifications and jump with a foreign service may also wear one set of foreign wings on their Class A uniform. According to AFI36-2903, page 139 (edition of 2 August 2006), Air Force personnel may wear foreign-awarded jump wings while stationed in the awarding country or attending an official or social function hosted by the awarding government, and if the recipient has already been awarded US jump wings.

The original Parachutist Badge was designed in 1941 by Lieutenant General (then Captain) William P. Yarborough and approved by the Department of the Army in March of that year. In addition to the Parachutist Badge, U.S. Army paratroopers wore a &quot;paraglider&quot; patch on the front left side (enlisted) or right side (officers) of the garrison cap. Until the late 1940s, glider units were also included within Airborne divisions, hence the parachute and glider on the cap. The garrison cap with the paraglider patch was replaced by the maroon beret. Troops of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), a former parachute unit, continued to wear the garrison cap with patch until the black beret was adopted Army-wide except for of organizations already wearing maroon (Airborne) or green (Special Forces) berets, and or switched from black to tan (Ranger).

The U.S Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia was originally known as the U.S. Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge and designed by American Insignia Company in 1942 for graduates of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School. During WWII, despite being against uniform regulations it became common for U.S. Marine Corps paratroopers who were issued the silver U.S. Army Basic Parachutist badge to wear the gold Navy Certified Parachute Rigger badge because they believed the gold &quot;Rigger wings&quot; looked better on their uniform. This unauthorized wear of the Parachute Rigger badge became so common that in July 1963 the Commander of United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance Bruce F. Meyers sent a request to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral George W. Anderson Jr. via Marine Corps Commandant General David M. Shoup requesting to officially make the Navy Parachute Rigger badge the parachutist badge for the Navy and Marine Corps. The request was approved by Admiral Anderson on 12 July 1963 per BuPers Notice 1020. Since 1963, being a graduate of the U.S. Navy Parachute Rigger School is no longer a requirement to earn the badge.

==Argentina==
In the Argentinian Army, personnel who complete the basic parachutist training receive a badge consisting of a silver winged parachute. A golden badge is awarded to personnel after fulfilling certain requirements, including a number of years spent in a parachute unit, a number of jumps and completion of at least two more parachute-related courses besides the basic one, such as rigger, jumpmaster, free-fall jump, etc. This system replaced the one existing until 1993 when, despite parachute experience, officers wore a golden badge, NCOs a silver one and privates a smaller silver one. Navy, Air Force and Gendarmerie parachutists were similar badges to those of the Army.

==Czechoslovakia==
Czechoslovak badges were awarded in three classes:
:: 3rd Class
:: 2nd Class
:: 1st Class

==Canada==

Canadian Paratroopers with Canadian Jump Wings date back to the days of the 1st Special Service Force and 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion of World War II. In 1942 Canada had its own distinctive wings, worn on the left breast above service ribbons. This style was awarded until 1968 when the current wings were introduced. There are two classes of Canadian Jump Wings, red maple leaf for completion of the Basic Parachutist&#x27;s Course, and white maple leaf for completing the basic course, and sufficient months of service in a designated parachutist&#x27;s position. The Canadian Airborne Regiment (April 1968 to March 1995) were the most well known wearers of the Canadian Jump Wings. After its disbandment in 1995, the Canadian army&#x27;s parachute traditions reverted to the pre-1968 practice of maintaining a parachute company within one of the battalions of each of the regular infantry regiments. Many of the Airborne Regiment&#x27;s soldiers, returned to their regimental &quot;homes&quot; and stood up companies in the light battalion of each of their regiments (the 3rd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment, the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry and the 3rd Battalion Royal 22e Régiment). These soldiers, and jump-qualified members of the Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada, are entitled to wear the white leaf jump wings. Foreign service members and all other graduates who complete the Canadian basic parachutist course will receive the red leaf jump wings.

<doc id="954731" wikidata="Q1339764" url="?curid=954731" title="Ford Expedition">
<text>The Ford Expedition is a full-size SUV produced by Ford since the 1997 model year. The successor to the Ford Bronco, the Expedition shifted its form factor from an off-road oriented vehicle to a truck-based station wagon. Initially competing against the Chevrolet Suburban, the Expedition also competes against the Toyota Sequoia, Nissan Armada, and the Jeep Wagoneer.

First used for a 1992 F-150 concept vehicle, Ford first marketed the Expedition nameplate for 1995 on a trim level package for the two-door Ford Explorer Sport. As with its Bronco predecessor, the Expedition is heavily derives its chassis from the Ford F-150, differing primarily in suspension configuration. All five generations of the Expedition have served as the basis of the Lincoln Navigator–the first full-size luxury SUV. The model line is produced in two wheelbases (an extended-wheelbase variant introduced was introduced for 2007, largely replacing the Ford Excursion), with seating for up to eight passengers. 

Ford currently assembles the Expedition at its Kentucky Truck Assembly facility (Louisville, Kentucky) alongside the Lincoln Navigator and Super Duty trucks. Prior to 2009, the model line was assembled by the Michigan Assembly Plant (Wayne, Michigan). 

==Background==
The Expedition offered up to nine-passenger seating in model years before 2007 (with a front bench seat option in the first row); 2007–present model year Expeditions have bucket seats in the first row and seats eight passengers. From its introduction in 1996 to 2014, it was powered by a standard &quot;Triton&quot; V8 engine when, for the 2015 model year, it was replaced with a more compact, yet more efficient and powerful 3.5L &quot;EcoBoost&quot; V6 engine. It is similar to the Lincoln Navigator, especially in &quot;Limited&quot; (2005–2024) or &quot;King Ranch&quot; (2005–2017; 2020–present) high-end trims; both of which were introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year. With the 2011 model year, the base model was designated XL, an upgraded XLT, and a new XLT Premium that replaced the Eddie Bauer trim (1997–2010) which was phased out from the entire Ford vehicle lineup. As of 2010, over 1,545,241 Expeditions (both standard and EL/Max) had been sold. A modified &quot;Special Service Vehicle&quot; version is available for law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and emergency medical services.

The Expedition is also known for being one of the longest-lasting vehicles on the road. With 5% of vehicles over 200,000 miles, it landed the #4 spot in a 2016 study by iSeeCars.com listing the top 10 longest-lasting vehicles. The Expedition was also the last Ford vehicle to retain its older design found in the early to mid 2000&#x27;s, meaning, all the way up to 2017, it kept its triangular-styled tail-lamps and rounded-rectangular shaped headlamps along with the overall boxy shape of the body.

==First generation (1997)==
Known internally at Ford as the UN93, the first generation Expedition was developed under the UN93 program from 1993 to 1996, headed by chief engineer Dale Claudepierre at a cost of US$1.3 billion. Initial planning began in 1991 parallel to PN96 F-Series development, prior to the UN93 program fully being approved in 1993. Styling approval was completed in early 1993 ( years ahead of 1996 production) under design chief Bob Aikins, with the UN93 design being frozen by September 1993, at 34 months prior to the start of production in July 1996.

The all-new full-size SUV was unveiled on May 9, 1996, and launched on October 2, 1996, as a 1997 model. It replaced the aging two-door Ford Bronco. The &quot;XLT&quot; was the base model. The Expedition featured optional three row seating, first-row captain&#x27;s chair seating, available second row captains chair seating, leather seating surfaces, illuminated running boards, heated side view mirrors, power moon roof, dual zone climate control and Ford&#x27;s Mach audio sound system with rear subwoofer. Many of these features were standard on the &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; version.

Expedition was available with automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive with two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4406 transfer case and a center multi-disc differential. ControlTrac was introduced in 1995 and included four selectable modes: Two High, Auto, Four High (lock) and Four Low (lock). Two High mode and Auto mode with &quot;auto-lock&quot; was not available.

A short- and long-arm (SLA) independent front suspension with speed-sensitive power-assisted steering was combined with a multi-link rear live axle. Optional equipment included off-road under-body skid-plate protection, &quot;Traction-Lok&quot; rear limited-slip differential, and a heavy-duty trailer towing package.

Optional was an electronically controlled pneumatic air suspension system that would raise and lower the vehicle depending on road and load conditions. The system also included a kneel-down mode for easier ingress and egress, as well as loading cargo,

Standard was the 4.6L Triton V8 with the 5.4L version optional. The first-generation Expedition was rated as a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV). The latter engine combined with the heavy-duty trailer towing package and appropriate axle ratio can achieve a towing capacity of .

===Safety and security===

A two air bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash fuel pump shut-off, and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and locking retractors.

An optional four air bag SRS with 4-way occupant protection was available for the 2000–2002 model years. This included seat-mounted side torso side air bags.

The 2001 model introduced a BeltMinder system to detect when the driver did not have their safety belt secured.

===Model year changes===
====1998====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. A new exterior color was added: &quot;Wedgewood Blue&quot;. Limited availability for 4.6L Windsor versus Romeo engine. This limited run was available only for Expeditions equipped with the Ultimate Tow Package.

====1999====

The 1999 model year received a facelift similar to that of the contemporary Ford F-150. Included in the update was a new front grille which now dropped lower in the center, as well as a new front bumper that incorporated the fog lamps into the lower valance and larger center air intake. Both the 4.6L and 5.4L V8 engines received updates including increased power and torque. The Two-High mode for automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel-drive equipped models was dropped, leaving only Auto, Four High (lock), and Four Low (lock) modes. The dashboard also received an updated radio and air conditioning controls and revised gauge cluster and a digital odometer for the first time.
====2000====
Available features on 2000 models included a hidden radio antenna (integrated into the rear quarter panel window glass), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rearview mirrors, lane departure indicators on side view mirrors (before on the glass portion of the mirror). The lower front bumper valance and illuminated running boards were changed over to Arizona beige to complement the standard Arizona beige exterior body trim on Eddie Bauer models. &quot;Estate Green Clearcoat Metallic&quot; replaces &quot;Spruce Green Clearcoat Metallic&quot;, and &quot;Arizona Beige Metallic&quot; replaces &quot;Harvest Gold Clearcoat Metallic&quot; in the color palette.

====2001====
New trim packages included the &quot;XLT&quot; model. XLT versions could be optioned with the &quot;XLT No Boundaries&quot; package that included monochromatic black paintwork with chrome grille and special alloy wheels. Eddie Bauer versions could be optioned with the &quot;Eddie Bauer Premier&quot; package that included either monochromatic Arizona beige or solid black paintwork with painted alloy wheels and upgraded leather seating. A reverse sensing system was made optional.

====2002====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the UN93. This was also the last model year for XLT No Boundaries and Eddie Bauer Premier trims.
===Ford SVT Thunder===
Ford&#x27;s Special Vehicle Team proposed a high-performance variant called Thunder for the 2000 model year. It was equipped with the 5.4 L V8 from the SVT Lightning pickup and had a top speed of . However, since this generation of the Expedition had only two model years left, it was never put into production.

==Second generation (2003)==
The redesigned second-generation Expedition was developed under the U222 program code name from 1996 to 2002, under Ford chief vehicle engineer Steve von Foerster and chief program engineer John Krafcik from 1998 to 2002. Design work began in 1997, with a proposal by Tyler Blake being chosen by management and frozen for production in 1999. UN93-body mules were spotted testing in 2000, with full prototypes running from late 2000. The new Expedition was unveiled at the 2002 North American International Auto Show, in January. It was launched in May 2002 for the 2003 model year and featured a new four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system, becoming the first full-size sport utility vehicle to use a fully independent suspension.

The new independent rear suspension (IRS) was perceived as being controversial by some at the time of its introduction. A misconception was that the Expedition&#x27;s towing and off-road capabilities would be reduced, in comparison to the previous generation&#x27;s rear live axle. Nevertheless, underbody obstacle clearance improved by half an inch, and up to two inches under the axle differentials. The new suspension reduces rear unsprung mass by , and allows for a full of suspension travel (how much the wheels can travel up or down) improving its ability to traverse uneven terrain for improved control and ride quality. The four-wheel independent long-travel suspension itself is a purpose-built version of race suspensions found on off-road desert race vehicles.

The Expedition also gained a hydroformed fully boxed frame providing a 70 percent improvement in torsional stiffness. Towing capacity increased by for a maximum towing capacity of when properly equipped with the appropriate axle ratio and heavy-duty trailer towing package. Payload capacity was increased to a maximum of . Models equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package received a heavy duty 9.75&quot; rear differential and axle combination compared to the 8.8&quot; of the standard version.

Along with the high towing capability came all-new steering, braking and electronic systems to help the Expedition better control and maneuver long heavy trailers. Adaptive variable assist power rack-and-pinion steering was introduced along with the largest brake rotors in the segment at that time ( up front, in back) with brake calipers 100 percent stiffer than the previous generation Expedition. The four-speed &quot;4R70W&quot; automatic transmission received all-new control software to allow the transmission to automatically adjust to the demands of towing, using new computer logic that recognizes changes in load and road conditions.

The automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel-drive system remained available, with an uprated two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4416 transfer case. The new transfer case featured an updated intelligent locking center multi-disc differential with front-to-rear &quot;torque biasing&quot; capability in Auto mode. A new dedicated microprocessor with new control software was added allowing the system to detect different terrain and surface conditions to predict traction loss before it happens. Two High mode was also reintroduced. Four-wheel electronic traction control was now available as an option, and simulated &quot;front&quot; and &quot;rear&quot; differential locks.

The V8 engines offered on the previous generation were carried over, but not without major changes and improvements. Both the 4.6 L and 5.4 L Triton V8 engines received further refinements in design and overall efficiency. The Expedition qualified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) and was certified under the Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 regulations one year earlier than required. The 4.6 L engine received an all-new redesigned cast aluminium engine block optimized for weight reduction and NVH improvements. The 5.4 L engine received an all-new redesigned cast-iron engine block with computer-designed ribbing and bracing, along with thicker side skirts and reinforcement at the oil pan flange. The new engine block helped reduce engine vibration and unwanted noise while providing refined performance.

Both engines featured piston skirts coated with a Teflon-based friction-reducing material, and fitted with low-tension, low oil consumption rings. In addition, a new fail-safe cooling mode provided protection even in the case of a catastrophic coolant loss (such as a punctured radiator). In the event of coolant loss, the engine control unit shuts off fuel to alternate cylinders to reduce the risk of engine damage from overheating. The valves continue to operate, in order to pump cooling air through the cylinders. The cooling system was designed to maintain an ideal engine temperature even when subjected to a prolonged 15 percent gradient in weather. A returnless fuel supply system helped to reduce evaporative emissions by providing consistent pressure to the fuel injectors through a high-pressure pump.

New active hydraulic engine mounts were introduced to prevent the powertrain from inducing vibrations into the chassis. By optimizing these engine mounts, the engine block can act as a mass damper, absorbing chassis resonance, improving ride comfort.

Expedition&#x27;s passenger cabin was better sealed than before, in an effort to eliminate intrusive outside noise from reaching the occupants. Wind, powertrain, road and vehicle body noise was reduced by improving interior acoustics through new damping materials, a total of 10 shear-style isolating body mounts, heavier sealing of body and panels, redesigned rubber door seals, and extensive use of interior structural acoustic foam in the upper B-pillars, upper and lower D-pillars and floor pan. Road noise was reduced by 2 decibels, body air leakage reduced by 56 percent, chances for sealant noise disturbances reduced from 15 percent to less than 0.5 percent and wind noise measured at was reduced from 35 sones to a world class level of 29 sones.

The Expedition also received a thorough exterior and interior cosmetic redesign. Expedition featured an all-new front fascia, grille work, headlamps, body trim, rear fascia, tail lamps and liftgate. Interior fit and finish were improved with an all-new interior featuring new dash, door panels, genuine aluminium trim, and plush carpeting. Premium perforated leather seating surfaces were standard on Expedition &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; (optional on Expedition &quot;XLT&quot;). Expedition &quot;FX4&quot; models featured all of Expedition&#x27;s optional off-road equipment as standard equipment. Expedition&#x27;s drag coefficient was 0.41 Cd.

Three-row seating was standard with all-new manual fold-flat stow away third row seats. No longer did owners have to remove the third rows seats for more storage. The third row could simply &quot;disappear&quot; into the floor. Power assisted PowerFold fold-flat third row seating was available as an optional extra. Available features included in-dash CD-ROM–based navigation system, DVD based rear entertainment system, ultrasonic rear park assist/back up sensors, power moon roof, power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals (introduced on the first generation Expedition), Gentex auto dimming electrochromatic rear view mirror, turn signals, side marker lights and reflectors, second-row captain&#x27;s chair luxury seating, premium audiophile sound system with in-dash six-disc CD changer and rear subwoofer and four-wheel independent pneumatic air-ride suspension system.

===Powertrains===

===Safety and security===

Like the generation before, a two airbags supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard on Expedition. The dual front SRS air bags now included the Personal Safety System (PSS). PSS would tailor air bag deployment for driver and first passenger and included occupant classification, seat position, crash severity, safety belt pretensioner, load-limiting retractor and safety belt buckle usage sensors.

A new optional four-air-bag supplementary restraint system (SRS) with 6-way occupant protection was also available. This new air bag system included &quot;Safety Canopy&quot; dual side curtain air bags for head, upper torso and rollover protection. Safety Canopy would deploy along the A, B and C-pillars down to the vehicle&#x27;s beltline. Safety Canopy could remain inflated after deployment for extended protection and replaced the dual front side airbags featured on the first-generation Expedition.

Other features included side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash fuel pump shut-off, tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) and four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and emergency brake assist (EBA). &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; electronic stability control with traction control system was introduced as an optional extra. The electronic traction and stability mitigation system would expand to include &quot;roll stability control&quot; (RSC) for the 2005 model year.

===Model year changes===

====2003====
Before the 2003 model year ended, Ford updated the running boards on Expeditions equipped with the Eddie Bauer trim. Earlier in the model year, Eddie Bauer models had received standard black running boards. Toward the end of the model year, Arizona beige running boards were reintroduced to complement the Arizona beige body work which came standard on Eddie Bauer. Body colored running boards had previously been offered on the first-generation Expedition from 2000 to 2002.

====2004====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The Expedition &quot;Eddie Bauer Premier&quot; model is reintroduced after being absent from the 2003 model trim line-up. Monochromatic paint work with blacked-out headlamps and special alloy wheels were standard on Eddie Bauer Premier versions. A new Expedition &quot;XLT Sport&quot; model is added with Dark Shadow grey exterior body trim. The &quot;FX4&quot; trim level was renamed &quot;NBX&quot;.

====2005====
Expedition received new roof rails which replaced the traditional sliding cross-bar roof racks. A new high end &quot;Limited&quot; trim level replaced the Eddie Bauer Premier model (though the regular Eddie Bauer was still available) and featured chrome accented roof rails, chrome-clad aluminium wheels, PowerFold power assisted stowable side view mirrors and chrome tipped exhaust. An upper high end &quot;King Ranch&quot; trim level with Castano leather seating was also introduced. The base 4.6 L Triton V8 engine was dropped for the 2005 model year as the 5.4 L Triton V8 was made standard on all Expeditions and updated with 24-valve technology and variable valve timing. The Expedition also received a significantly updated version of the four-speed 4R70W automatic transmission.

The new four-speed automatic transmission, now called &quot;4R75E&quot;, featured fully electronic Smart Shift technology. A turbine speed sensor improved transmission control and provided the basis for the fully electronic shift scheduling. The transmission&#x27;s microprocessor speeds were improved for better responsiveness and precision of the control system. The transmission was continuously learning, and would calculate the torque in the next gear and schedule shift points based on the Expedition&#x27;s projected performance in the next gear. For 2005 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter &quot;B&quot; on the manufacturer&#x27;s safety compliance certification label, located in the driver&#x27;s-side doorjamb. For 2006 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter &quot;Q&quot;.

====2006====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. Last year model for the U222. The Gentex auto-dimming rearview mirrors were updated. Two new exterior colors were added: &quot;Pewter Metallic&quot; and &quot;Dark Copper Metallic&quot;. The &quot;Medium Flint Grey&quot; interior color was also added to Limited models later on within the model year. Chrome tipped exhaust was made standard on King Ranch models. 2006 would be the last year model for the NBX trim. The ultrasonic rear park assist and Safety Canopy side curtain airbags were offered as standalone options. Adjustable headrests were also added to the front seats to replace the one piece units.

====Russian Moscow–Chukotka overland expedition====
On April 12, 2006, three second-generation full-size Ford Expedition &quot;Eddie Bauer&quot; vehicles completed a 32-day overland expedition from Moscow to Chukotka. This was a trip across North Asia and the Arctic Tundra. Six team members consisted of leaders Alexey Mikhailov and Alexander Borodin; technical director Andrey Rodionov; and professional off-road drivers Sergey Goryachev, Victor Parshikov, and Alexey Simakin. The route took them on permafrost and crossed the Arctic Circle twice. Visited landmarks included where American aviator Carl Ben Eielson was lost, and the birthplace of Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnev. The northernmost point on the route was latitude 69°42′ North (Pevek). The easternmost point visited was longitude 169°40′ West (Cape Dezhnev). Temperatures reached and the team encountered whiteouts and a polar cyclone. An estimated of snow was removed from each of the vehicles on the following day.

The vehicles were modified with front end guards along with front and rear utility bumpers, winches, safari roof racks, high-powered off-road lights and extra underbody plating for the engines. Two of the vehicles towed a dual axle utility trailer. Two were equipped also with caterpillar track systems supplied by Mattracks. The rubber track systems were only used when off-road conditions became too demanding for conventional tires. The rear stabilizer bar failed on both vehicles fitted with the Mattracks system. The vehicles were also equipped with gas stoves (to prepare food) and high-capacity auxiliary fuel tanks (mounted in the rear cargo bay) and sometimes run on poor-quality gasoline.

== Third generation (2007)==
In 2006, Ford introduced the third generation of the Expedition developed under the U324 program code name which was an updated version of the second generation Expedition, now using a new ladder frame architecture called T1, an evolution of 11th generation P221 F-150 architecture. Most of the improvements were mechanical in nature, and included a sheet metal refresh and redesigned interior with upgraded materials, as well as a new long wheelbase version, called &quot;Expedition EL&quot; in the U.S. and &quot;Expedition Max&quot; in other markets.

The high-strength hydroformed fully boxed Ford T platform (chassis) was a modified version of the half-ton platform from the Ford F-150. The new T1 platform replaced the one dating to the original model, and provides 10 percent more torsional rigidity. T1 incorporates a four-wheel independent long-travel suspension system (first introduced on the second generation) with redesigned suspension geometry and an all-new five-link rear suspension with new rear lower control-arms. As with previous model years, the suspension system could be had with adaptive pneumatic air-ride springs.

Ford&#x27;s new 6-speed &quot;6R75&quot; intelligent automatic transmission with dual overdrive gears was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic transmission control module (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss in case of a power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system&#x27;s memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner&#x27;s driving style.

Additionally, the Expedition is powered by the same 5.4L Triton V8 engine from the previous generation, rated at and of torque. When properly equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package, it can tow up to . Expedition is classed under the Tier 2, Bin 5 / ULEV 2 Ultra Low Emission Vehicle environmental classification.

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure and ramp breakover angles are 22°, 21°, and 18° respectively. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance is . Underbody (overall) ground clearance is 9.1 inches (230 mm).

Selectable automatic full-time Control Trac four-wheel drive continues to be offered, and uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner 4417 transfer case with intelligent locking center multi-disc differential and &quot;torque biasing&quot; capability. Four-wheel electronic traction control is standard and off-road underbody skid plate armor is optional. A new default off-road program with throttle response recalibration was added, and is automatically activated when Four Low (lock) mode is selected. Expedition can achieve an off-road crawl ratio of 41.06:1 with a low range ratio of 2.64:1 and rear axle ratio of 3.73:1.

The SUV also underwent a nip/tuck with a few cosmetic enhancements, both inside and out. Expedition&#x27;s front end now featured Ford&#x27;s signature three &quot;hollow-bar&quot; grille to complement the SUV&#x27;s close relation to the F-150 and Super Duty pickups. New complex stepped style multifaceted headlamps, side view mirrors with updated LED lane departure indicators, sleeker body work and redesigned tail lamps were also added. The interior received a new dash, which would eventually appear on the 2008 Super Duty, new center console, and redesigned first row captains chairs, door panels and interior trim.

To further reduce outside noise intrusion for quieter, more isolated ride comfort, new SoundScreen laminated acoustic and solar tinted windshield was added with thicker laminated side window glass.

The new SUV was unveiled at the Houston Auto Show rather than at the North American International Auto Show, the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show, or the New York International Auto Show where most new models are, as 20 percent of all Expedition sales are in Texas. The third generation Expedition went on sale in August 2006. The first 2007 Expedition to roll off a Ford assembly line was donated by Ford to the Peter family of Jamaica, Queens, New York as part of an episode of the American Broadcasting Company series &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; that aired May 7, 2006.

In late 2014, the third generation standard wheelbase U324 Expedition and long-wheelbase U354 Expedition EL/Max underwent a cosmetic and mechanical refresh for the 2015 model year.

===Model year changes===
====2008====
For the 2008 model year, power deployable running boards became available, along with a rearview camera. The camera, which is mounted under the Expedition&#x27;s center liftgate appliqué, utilizes the Gentex auto dimming rearview mirror&#x27;s picture-in-mirror technology to display what it sees. Expedition &quot;King Ranch&quot; was also reintroduced after being absent from the 2007 model year trim line-up. Expedition &quot;XLT&quot; models now get body-colored lower bodywork, replacing the previous black plastic trim, and 2008 was the last year first-row bench seating was available.

====2009====
In July 2008, Ford&#x27;s Wayne, Michigan, plant started production of the 2009 models until finishing the plant&#x27;s run in December of that same year. In January 2009, production of the Expedition was relocated to the Kentucky Truck Assembly in Louisville along with its sister SUV, the Lincoln Navigator, and the Ford F-Series Super Duty. That plant used to build the Ford Excursion until 2005.

Expedition&#x27;s 6-speed 6R75 automatic was replaced by an improved version, the 6-speed 6R80 automatic. It features more robust internals, new software logic, and a tow/haul mode (replacing the overdrive lock-out) that utilizes new uphill/downhill gradient shift logic for improved performance while towing or hauling heavy loads. The 6-speed automatic can compensate for altitude, grade/slope and present load conditions. The system also reduces the transmission&#x27;s tendency to &quot;hunt&quot; for the right gear(s) and provides engine braking when descending hills. The nine-passenger front bench seating option has been discontinued for the 2009 model year, leaving only the eight-passenger seating option left with two front bucket seats and two rear bench seats. The chrome &quot;Expedition&quot; name plate badges have been removed from the left and right front doors. The chrome &quot;Expedition&quot; nameplate badge on the rear liftgate remains.

Additional features included the now-standard E85 capability, which can take gasoline, E85 (85% ethanol/15% gasoline), or any combination of the two, and the newly installed Easy Fuel capless fuel-filler system. The engine&#x27;s power rating also increased to , while the torque rating stayed the same at (both ratings on gasoline). A properly-equipped 2009 Expedition could now tow up to for the 4×2 version, and up to for the 4×4 version.

The new entertainment features added to the 2009 model year included the optional Ford SYNC, and an all-new DVD-based, voice-activated, multi-entertainment/navigational system with an LCD touch screen. The rearview camera system now shows the video feed through the navigation screen; however, the rearview mirror is still used to show images on Expeditions not equipped with the navigation system. The new navigation system featured up to 10 gigabytes of storage space for more than 2,400 songs, a jukebox function, a screened photo display, iPod/Zune capability for downloading and recharging, a CD ripping function, integrated compatibility with cell phones, Bluetooth, the newly compatible Sirius Travel Link (which allowed drivers to access traffic, weather, sports, and local movie listings), and a &quot;Route Guidance&quot; mode for road and street information. The steering wheel also had a tilt feature and radio controls, including Ford SYNC buttons, allowing the driver to press the button and use voice commands to activate the system, which became standard on Eddie Bauer, Limited, and King Ranch. The tilt with radio control feature was optional on XLT models built at the Wayne plant, but after production moved to Louisville, it became standard. For accessory purposes, an HD radio could be installed upon request at a Ford dealership in the United States. New for 2009 were standard heated second-row outboard seats on the Limited and King Ranch models only with either the second row bench seat or the optional bucket seats.

====2010====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. For the 2010 model year, optional packages have now been renamed (to Rapid Specificated Order Codes) and upgraded (100S for XLT, 200S for Eddie Bauer, 300S for Limited, 400S for King Ranch) for the newer models. It was also announced that the 2010 models would now feature Ford&#x27;s MyKey and trailer sway control as standard on all trims. The 2010 models were ranked sixth among the top 11 affordable large-size SUVs in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. A diesel version for the 2010 model year did not get past the planning stage. Rain-sensing windshield wipers were added as an optional extra for Eddie Bauer, but standard on the Limited and King Ranch versions.

====2011====
No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. HD Radio became standard on all trims, and a dual headrest DVD player system became an optional feature. Also, the Expedition now offered the newly designated standard XL trim with lower black cladding, while the XLT trim was upgraded along with a new XLT Premium trim with gold cladding, the latter replacing the Eddie Bauer level trim. Also, silver cladding was added as an exterior trim as part of a newly optional XLT Premium Sport Appearance Package. Both Limited and King Ranch trims receive new paint and interior trim. The Limited trim also has a chrome grille for a change.

====2012====

No major cosmetic or mechanical changes. The second-row heated seat option was added to XLT Premium and the front park assist became a standard feature on the Limited and King Ranch trims.

====2013====
No major cosmetic changes; however, the XL trim and XLT Sport options were dropped, leaving only the XLT, XLT Premium, Limited, and King Ranch trims. Updates made to the 2013 models (which went on sale in August 2012) included the TowCommand trailer brake controller system that is bundled with the heavy-duty trailer towing package, a new internal shift control module which allows the six-speed automatic transmission to tailor shifts to engine demand, ten equipment levels, three new colors (&quot;Blue Jeans Metallic&quot;, &quot;Kodiak Brown Metallic&quot; and &quot;Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat&quot;), and a new 20-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels that was available on both the Limited and King Ranch trims. The latter trim also featured chrome roof racks and side mirrors. Another notable change can be found on the driver&#x27;s instrumental panel, with the temperature and fuel gauge trading sides.

====2014====
No major cosmetic changes. Only three trims (XLT, Limited and King Ranch) were offered. The Sirius XM with Navlink and HD radio was added to the XLT as an optional feature. A new, quieter, mechanical Nivomat adaptive hydraulic load-leveling suspension system was available, in place of the adaptive pneumatic air-ride load-leveling suspension. When properly equipped, the Expedition continued to offer top-end towing capability with a braked trailer towing capacity of .

====2015====

On February 18, 2014, Ford introduced a mid-cycle refresh of the Expedition (U324) and Expedition EL (U354), dubbed the U3242 and U3542 respectively, for the 2015 model year. The &quot;2&quot; signified the second phase of the U324 and U354. They debuted at the Dallas–Fort Worth Auto Show on February 19, 2014, as Texas (especially Dallas and Houston) was a popular market. Despite a 27% drop in sales since 2008, Ford was committed to continuing producing the Expeditions. Ford started production on the updated Expedition (and Expedition EL, which continued to compete with the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon XL) around the first quarter of 2014 and placed the 2015 models in dealerships in July 2014. Ford announced that the three trim levels—XLT, Limited, and King Ranch—would continue to be offered along with a new top-of-the-line Platinum trim. On September 12, 2013 (the same day that GM unveiled its next-generation SUVs), Automobile Magazine posted a spy shot of the 2015 Expedition, which showed a repositioned tailpipe, and a more upright front fascia which bore a taller, wider grille that appeared to be inspired by the F-150 and Super Duty trucks.

Official photos released on February 18, 2014, revealed an all-new aggressive armadillo-like three-bar grille, which featured step-stacked bars evoking the appearance of stepped armor-plating on an armadillo&#x27;s back. All-new thinner headlamps were added, in addition to an all-new front bumper with oversized lower air intake. The new bumper also featured a lower chrome bar and twin LED fog lamps flanking the chrome bar. Brightwork was added on the rear liftgate, and the tailpipe was repositioned straight, instead of making a 90-degree turn behind the right rear wheel.

The Expedition remained a body-on-frame SUV, allowing it to retain its heavy-duty truck underpinnings for towing and hauling needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.motoring2.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The full-size SUV received the 3.5L 24-valve DOHC Ti-VCT EcoBoost V6 engine featuring an aluminium engine block, twin-turbochargers, direct injection, and twin independent variable camshaft timing. The EcoBoost was rated at 365 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque, and replaced the 5.4L V8 as Ford wanted to make the SUV more fuel-efficient. As a result, the Expedition boosted its fuel economy to (city) / (highway) for the 2WD and (city) / (highway) for the 4WD, now being on par with GM&#x27;s new full-size SUVs, which also boasted similar fuel economy ratings to the Expedition. In addition to the new engine, the Expedition received an updated 6-speed 6R80 SelectShift intelligent manumatic gearbox with manual shift mode. The Expedition also features a new electric power servo-assisted steering and Pull-Drift Compensation (PDC) which detects crosswinds and compensates for it.

The interior remained similar to the outgoing models, but with upgraded materials and a revised prominent center stack, now derived from the 2013–2014 F-150 rather than the 2008–2010 Super Duty. Also new is the latest version of the 8-inch MyFord Touch touchscreen infotainment and telematics system. Push-to-start engine ignition with intelligent access was added and the optional four-wheel-drive mode selector was revised and repositioned. The TowCommand paddle controls were repositioned over the four-wheel drive mode selector, to make way for revised audio and climate controls on the center stack.

The new features for 2015 included an optional, revised four-wheel independent suspension system with intelligent continuously controlled damping (CCD) system that alters suspension settings constantly based on 46 parameters and offers comfort, normal, and sport modes. Expedition is the first Ford vehicle in North America to have continuously controlled damping. Other new optional features included blind-spot information system (BLIS) with cross-traffic alert, and a rearview camera and apps for the infotainment system to help with towing and off-road driving, all of which is standard in the Platinum trim, whose seating and interior features included Brunello leather, a red wine color with tuxedo-stripe accents and French seamed stitching, or black leather with Agate Gray accents.

The selectable automatic full-time &quot;ControlTrac&quot; four-wheel drive system continued to be offered, but gains a trio of new off-road electronic systems in the form of Hill Ascent Assist (HAA), Hill Descent Control (HDC), and Ford Truck Apps (FTA). FTA gave off-road orientation/geometry, 4×4 system status, and traction control system status in real-time. The four-wheel electronic traction control system (brake differential locking control) was recalibrated to take into account the new EcoBoost V6&#x27;s higher torque output and earlier torque delivery.

EcoBoost Performance

The heavyweight as tested, 2015 Expedition &quot;Platinum&quot; with 3.5 liter EcoBoost V6 and selectable automatic full-time ControlTrac four-wheel drive was clocked from in 6.4 seconds. The full-size SUV can achieve in 18.2 seconds, in 24.3 seconds, and is electronically safety-limited to . Expedition has a near perfect 50:50 front:rear balanced weight distribution and center of gravity positioned at 28.5 inches.

Expedition &quot;Platinum&quot; averaged in a slalom run and pulled 0.78g in roadholding skidpad testing. High speed emergency braking from was completed in . In comparison, the Expedition&#x27;s main rival took a full longer, completing the same emergency brake test in .

====2016====
For the 2016 model year, most of the features that were introduced from 2015 were carried over. However, the Expedition began adding Ford&#x27;s upgraded enhanced SYNC 3 to its trims, as an optional feature on the XLT and standard on Limited, King Ranch and Platinum. The Limited added Sony&#x27;s Premium Audio System as a standard.

====2017====
In June 2016, Ford began selling the 2017 model year Expedition, with no major changes being made and continued to be offered in XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum level trims. This is the final year of the third generation Expedition and Expedition EL (U324) and (U354).

==Fourth generation (2018)==

The fourth-generation Expedition, known internally at Ford Motor Company as the &quot;U553&quot;, was unveiled on February 7, 2017, at the Dallas Cowboys training facility, Ford Center in Frisco, Texas, ahead of its Chicago Auto Show debut. Production of the new Expedition started on September 25, 2017. The vehicles arrived at dealerships in November 2017.

The all-new Expedition features body-on-frame architecture with high-strength lightweight material construction consisting of boron steel and aluminum. The four-door body is constructed from aluminium-alloy, while the frame is constructed from boron steel. The U553 will move to the all-new half-ton hydroformed T3 platform (chassis), which is a modified version of the half-ton platform underpinning the P552 2015 Ford F-150. The T3 platform will use a new four-wheel independent suspension system design. Updated powertrain systems (engines and transmissions) including a Hybrid variant with proprietary parallel hybrid electric-drive system to help increase fuel efficiency are expected. Expedition will gain Ford&#x27;s new 10-speed &quot;10R80&quot; &quot;SelectShift&quot; automatic transmission which will feature artificially intelligent shifting, electronic range select, manual shift mode, and be controlled via a rotary dial on the center console. The next-generation Expedition&#x27;s chief engineer is Jackie Marshall DiMarco, who is also the chief engineer for the next-generation F-150 pickup.

The Expedition is one of the first vehicles in North America to use a new next-generation high speed Controller Area Network 3 (CAN-3) vehicle data bus system. The CAN-3 electrical architecture is akin to a human nervous system and allows the Expedition&#x27;s various on-board microprocessors and electronic vehicle control systems to communicate or &quot;talk&quot; to one another through electronic data that is sent and received. With high speed CAN-3, the Expedition can learn and react faster than before.

The Expedition is available with selectable automatic full-time four-wheel drive that routes torque through a two-speed dual range transfer case with electronic locking center multi-disc differential. A new electronic locking rear differential is available to augment the four-wheel-drive system. Both the center and rear locking systems are teamed with four-wheel electronic traction control (ETC), which simulates a locking front differential by ABS &quot;brake locking&quot; the front differential. The Expedition&#x27;s off-road electronic aids Hill Descent Control (HDC) and Hill Ascent Assist (HAA) are joined by the Terrain Management System adapted from the Ford Raptor. Terrain Management is capable of working with 4L mode, like the Ford Raptor, and has seven drive modes to choose from which include Normal, Eco, Sport, Tow/Haul, Gravel/Snow, Mud/Ruts, and Sand. The four-wheel drive system has three direct drive modes which include 2H, 4A, and 4L. The 4H mode has been dropped from the selection, as the Terrain Management computer now controls the electronic center lock of the four-wheel drive system. Terrain Management engages the electronic center lock for a 50:50 front:rear torque split while in 4A direct drive mode, when the Mud/Ruts or Sand modes are selected. The 4L direct drive mode engages the electronic center lock regardless of the off-road drive mode selected. A &quot;tap to lock/unlock&quot; button is located near the drive mode dial for operation of the electronic rear lock.

Off-road geometry figures for approach, departure, and ramp breakover, improve slightly with 23.3°, 21.9°, and 21.4° of obstacle clearance. Minimum running (lowest point) ground clearance increases by a full inch, from .

The Expedition is certified by the Society of Automotive Engineers&#x27; independent SAE J2807 towing standard to tow a maximum of braked trailer. The tow rating increases by over the previous generation. Expedition will also feature Pro Trailer Backup Assist, a semi-autonomous system that allows the Expedition to reverse itself with a trailer coupled. The driver directs the system via a control dial, while the Expedition handles all steering and limits reversing speed.

Among the new features that have been incorporated into the fourth generation Expedition are a 360-degree camera and park assist system, along with optional safety features that use both camera and radar technology, and include automatic braking, lane-keep assist, active cruise control, and blind-spot monitors. In addition, there are two USB ports per row, four 12-volt outlets and a 120-volt household outlet. Ford has also partnered with Sling on a twin-screen rear entertainment system, as well as personal tablets on the vehicle&#x27;s Wi-Fi. The Wi-Fi can be used on up to 10 devices and features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities compatible with Ford SYNC3 and Ford Pass. A dual vista panoramic sunroof is available as an optional feature.

The 2018 Expedition was only available in four trim levels, as the King Ranch trim was discontinued after the 2017 model year. The three primary trims, XLT, Limited, and the top-of-the-line Platinum, were available to regular customers, while the fourth trim, XL, was exclusive to rental companies, corporate fleets, and government agencies, as it did not have as many features as the other three trims. The Expedition retains its unique (standard) eight-passenger seating on all trims like before, with optional seven-passenger seating.

=== Safety and security features ===

All 2018 Expedition models carry a power four-wheel disc antilock brake system (ABS) with brake assist and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), six standard airbags including a Safety Canopy System that provides side-curtain airbags with roll-fold technology and a rollover sensor, rear-door child-safety locks, a LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tether Anchors for Children), an Individual Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and a SOS Post-Crash Alert System.

The Expedition has an available Driver Assistance Package that equips the vehicle with smart driver-assist technology, including pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection and forward collision warning, lane-keeping assist, adaptive cruise control, auto high-beam headlamps, and rain-sensing wipers.

Standard security features include a SecuriLock Passive Anti-Theft System, a perimeter alarm, a personal safety system, MyKey, available inclination and intrusion sensors, as well as Ford&#x27;s proprietary keypad entry system, marketed as &quot;SecuriCode&quot;.

The &quot;Platinum&quot; features a specific performance-tuned version of the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 with and of torque (using 93 octane fuel) mated to the 10-speed &quot;10R80 SelectShift&quot; automatic transmission.

==== King Ranch ====
The King Ranch trim returned for the 2020 model year, slotted between the Limited and Platinum trim. As with the previous versions, the King Ranch logo is prominent on all three rows of seats, the floor mats, and the scuff plates, Stone Gray trim on bumpers, power running boards, roof rails, standard Del Rio leather on all seats, door trim, armrests, steering wheel, and center console, and roll-on machined aluminum wheels with darker painted pockets.

==== FX4 ====
An off-road FX4 package became available starting with the 2018 model year. This option, available to 4WD XLT level trims only and targeted towards the 20% of Expedition owners who use the vehicle for off-road purposes, is expected to compete with the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe Z71 package in both standard and MAX versions. Among the detailed features are electronic locking limited-slip rear differential, off-road-tuned shocks, all-terrain tires, skid plates, unique 18-inch cast-aluminum wheels, and chrome running boards.

==== XL STX ====
For the 2021 model year, Ford introduced the Expedition XL STX, which has a lower starting price than other Expedition trim levels. The Expedition XL STX lacks third-row seats, and has a split-bench second-row seat. It is only available in standard length, not the Max. Styling elements for the XL STX include a gloss-black grille and 18-inch aluminum wheels. A Heavy-Duty Trailer Tow Package is available.

===Model year changes===
====2019====
There were no major changes, as it carried some of the 2018 features over to the 2019 model year. Two new colors, silver spruce and black agate, was added to the list of palettes.

====2020====
The King Ranch level trim was bought back for the 2020 model year, placing it above the Platinum trim. The desert gold color feature was introduced with this 2020 model year, but is being discontinued due to lack of interest from customers.

====2022====
For the 2022 model year, the Expedition and Expedition Max receive a mid-cycle refresh. The refresh includes revised front end styling, new aluminum-alloy wheel designs for all models, as well as a revised interior that is similar to that of the all-new 2021 Ford F-150, and includes an optional fully-digital reconfigurable instrument cluster, as well as a standard twelve-inch or optional fifteen-inch SYNC 4A touchscreen infotainment system display that now includes SiriusXM Satellite Radio with 360L, and connected GPS navigation on select models. A new off-road oriented Timberline trim, based on the mid-level XLT trim, adds unique exterior and interior styling, unique seating surfaces, and off-road oriented tires with unique aluminum-alloy wheels. A new Limited Stealth Performance Package includes a higher-output version of the standard 3.5L EcoBoost twin-turbo V6 gasoline engine (now with and of torque), and unique exterior styling cues.

=== Powertrain ===
The 2018 Expedition&#x27;s die-cast aluminum 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 engine operates with a twin-independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) valvetrain, and a 10-speed automatic SelectShift transmission. The engine makes and . of torque at 5,000 rpm in XLT and Limited trims, and and . of torque at 5,000 rpm in the Platinum trim. It&#x27;s backed up by a gasoline direct injection fuel delivery system with a single, stainless steel exhaust. The drive ratio is 3.15 on a standard 4×2; 3.31 on standard 4×4 and 4×2 Max; and 3.73 on a 4×4 Max. The engine&#x27;s compression ratio is 10:5:1.



== Fifth generation (2025) ==
The fifth-generation Ford Expedition was revealed on October 3, 2024.

The fifth-generation Expedition gains a significantly reworked liftgate, called the Ford Split Gate, a feature initially seen on the fifth-generation Navigator, where it is called the Lincoln Split Gate. The top half opens like a regular liftgate, while the lower half opens much like the tailgate of a pickup truck which can support a weight up to . This feature is similar to the split tailgate found on Range Rover models, as well as BMW&#x27;s X5 and X7 models. The Split Gate also features a seatback as part of the optional Cargo Tailgate Manager.

The XL, XLT, and Limited trims for both standard and MAX models have been discontinued, with the King Ranch and Platinum trims being retained, while the new Active trim serves as the entry-level model. The Timberline off-road trim has been discontinued, and is replaced by the Tremor off-road trim in a first for Ford&#x27;s SUVs, as the Tremor name was initially exclusive to its line of trucks as either an off-road package or a standalone trim, while its SUVs used the Timberline name for their off-road oriented models. The Expedition Tremor gains 33-inch General Grabber all-terrain tires, off-road auxiliary lighting within the grille, Raptor-inspired running boards, underbody protection for the fuel tank, front axle, and transfer case, retuned steering and suspension, and Tremor Orange accents. The Expedition Tremor also receives an increase in ground clearance of 10.6 inches, and gains specialized features such as Trail 1-Pedal, Rock Crawl Mode, and Trail Turn Assist. The Expedition Tremor receives the high-output variant of the 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost engine as its sole engine option, which is also an option on the Platinum trim, while the standard 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost turbochaged gasoline engine serves as the only engine option for the rest of the line. The 10-speed automatic is the sole transmission offering available for the fifth generation.

Inside, the fifth-generation Expedition receives the Ford Digital Experience, originally debuted on the 2025 Explorer, and serving as the Ford counterpart to Lincoln&#x27;s Lincoln Digital Experience, which comes with WiFi hotspot, Alexa, Google Play, Google Maps, and Google Assistant built-in. Ford has also made BlueCruise available in 90 percent of the Expedition line, and comes with a 90-day free trial. A 24-inch panoramic display serves as the instrument cluster as well as displaying GPS and radio, and there is a 13.2-inch central touchscreen. 

A new feature on the Expedition is the Flex Powered Console, in which the center console is capable of sliding back by almost 8 inches, allowing easier access for second-row passengers, as well as revealing a hidden storage compartment suitable for storing objects such as small bags, purses, and documents. Available as an option is another new feature called Third-Row Flexible Seating, in which the middle seat of the third row folds down independent from the rest of the bench, allowing for increased storage for particularly long items.

The fifth-generation Expedition is capable of towing 7,000 pounds standard, or 9,600 pounds when fitted with a weight-distributing hitch. It is available with Pro Trailer Hitch Assist and Pro Trailer Backup Assist.

==Expedition EL/Max==


As part of the shift to the T1 platform for the 2007 model year, Ford developed an extended-length version of the Expedition, to more closely match the Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL in size. Introduced as the &quot;Ford Expedition EL&quot; (EL=extended length) alongside the Lincoln Navigator L, the variant effectively replaced the Super Duty-based Ford Excursion. In Canada, to avoid confusion with the Acura EL sedan, Ford renamed the extended-length version as the &quot;Expedition Max&quot;.

Originally intended to carry the Ford Everest name, Ford product planners changed their minds, as the nameplate was already in use for a midsize Ford SUV in Asia. Outside North America, including the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, the Expedition EL is also imported to and sold in the Middle East and Taiwan. In the Philippines, the Expedition EL is the only version imported and sold; coincidentally, it is also a market where the Ford Everest SUV is sold.

===Expedition EL/Max (2007–2017)===
For the 2007 model year, Ford introduced the extended-length Expedition EL. With a wheelbase stretched (to ) and a length increased (to ) over the standard Expedition, the EL is sized comparably to the Suburban/Yukon XL, providing additional cargo space over the standard-wheelbase version. The extended-length body of the EL is distinguished by its longer cargo-area windows and its rear door design (the rear wheels no longer intrude into the lower half of the doors).

Alongside the standard-length Ford Expedition, the EL was offered with a single powertrain; the 5.4 L Triton V8 was standard from 2007 to 2014, replaced by the twin-turbocharged 3.5 L EcoBoost V6 for 2015 to 2017. The EL is also sold with both rear-wheel and four-wheel-drive configurations. The larger overall size reduced towing capacity by approximately , to (for 2WD) and (for 4WD), over a standard-wheelbase example.

Over its first generation, the EL shared its features with the standard-length Expedition; for 2012 model, a cargo organizer became an exclusive feature. The Expedition EL was introduced in four trim lines: XLT, Eddie Bauer, Limited, and the King Ranch series during the 2007–2010 model year. For 2011, the Eddie Bauer trim was replaced by XLT and XLT Premium, with XL becoming the new base trim level. After 2012, all versions of the XL trim were dropped.

For 2015, the EL received the same facelift and upgrades as the standard-length Expedition.

Alongside the standard-length Expedition, the EL also received a 5-star rating from the NHTSA. The Expedition EL was also ranked 9th among the top 15 &quot;Best Family Haulers&quot;, according to a June 2009 consumers favorite survey conducted by Edmunds.


===Expedition Max (2018–2024)===
For its second generation, the Expedition EL became known as the Expedition Max (now stylized with all capitals as MAX) along with the rest of the world. It debuted in November 2017 for the 2018 model year. Like the standard-length Expedition, this was also unveiled ahead of the Chicago Auto Show and carried the same features and the three featured trims, XLT, Limited, and Platinum. It also expanded its length size by one inch to allow more space and legroom in the third seat row. Although the rear passenger doors were widened, the aft wheel well trim still does not cut into them.

This version became more competitive with the Suburban/Yukon XL in the long-wheelbase SUV segment, an area where GM has historically dominated. Like the standard-length Expedition, the Expedition Max also retained its (standard) eight-passenger seating on all trims like before. The Max saw a starting MSRP range of $55,000 (US) for the XLT and $66,800 (US) for the Limited trims, more expensive than the Suburban but on par with the Yukon XL in terms of pricing.
==Availability==
===Expedition===
The standard-length Expedition are sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the CNMI, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam, Republic of China (Taiwan), the Philippines, the Middle East (excluding Israel), Central America, the Caribbean, South America (except Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela), Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia and South Korea), Africa (Algeria, Angola, Cape Verde, Egypt, Gabon, Ghana, Libya, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria, and Senegal), and Central Asia (Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan).

After the 2015 refresh, the standard-length Expedition became exclusive to the United States, Canada, Mexico, Republic of China (Taiwan), and the Middle East. The US and Canadian Expeditions are available in XLT, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum, while The Mexican Expedition offers the XLT, Limited, and King Ranch trims. The Middle East Expeditions are offered in XL, XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and in Platinum (RWD only) trims.

With the introduction of the fourth-generation Expedition, Ford made the SUV available to North America in the Fall of 2017 first, followed by a global launch in early 2018, where it went on sale in selected countries.

===Expedition EL/Max===
For the Expedition EL/Max, all six versions (XL, XLT/Eddie Bauer, XLT Platinum/Sport, Limited, King Ranch and Platinum) are available in the United States. From the 2007 to 2010 model years, The EL/Max level trims were limited to only three versions for Canada, Taiwan, and the Middle East; two for Mexico; and one for the Philippines. Canada&#x27;s Expedition Max offered the Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch trims, Mexico&#x27;s Expedition Max in Limited and King Ranch trims, and the Middle East&#x27;s EL level trims in XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The Philippines&#x27; lone Expedition EL level trim was the Eddie Bauer model from 2007 to 2010.

After the 2011 model year Ford made changes in the international exportation of the EL/Max trims. As a result of the changes, the Limited trim became the only version available in Canada and Mexico as Eddie Bauer (in Canada) and King Ranch trims (in both Canada and Mexico) were discontinued, while the Philippines and the Middle East replaced the Eddie Bauer with the XLT trim. The Middle East also started to get all five US-market base trims, including the new XL trims that took the XLT&#x27;s place and the King Ranch trim.

With the 2015 refresh, the Expedition EL trims for the US market are the same as the standard versions: XLT, Limited, King Ranch, and Platinum, each in 2WD or 4WD. The Canadian Expedition Max is only available in Limited and Platinum level trims, also available in RWD and 4WD. Mexico&#x27;s Expedition Max are available in rear wheel drive XLT only, but available in RWD and 4WD Limited versions. The Philippines, Taiwan, and Middle East ELs are only available in 4WD Limited trims.

With the introduction of the Expedition Max for the 2018 model year as the successor to the first-generation Expedition EL, Ford made the vehicle available globally, with North America in late 2017 and selected countries in early 2018.

==Four-wheel drive system==

Selectable automatic full-time Control Trac four-wheel drive designed by BorgWarner is standard on all 4×4 Expeditions. There are four modes: Two High mode, Auto mode, Four High mode and Four Low mode. Each mode can be selected via a rotary control dial on the dash.

The Expedition&#x27;s system uses a two-speed dual range BorgWarner transfer case with a software controlled variable intelligent locking center multi-disc differential. The four-wheel drive system does not use a planetary or bevel geared center differential, which are typically found in permanent four-wheel-drive systems where torque is supplied to all four wheels.

4WD Expeditions come with standard dual front frame-mounted closed-loop recovery hooks and available off-road underbody protection. Steel plates are placed over vital areas with a composite shield for the fuel tank. Expedition 4x4s are tested alongside the F-150 and Super Duty trucks at Ford&#x27;s California and Arizona proving grounds. Expedition is put through the same durability tests and evaluations to meet the same durability standards as its pickup truck brethren.

===Traction control===
Rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive have conventional open-type differentials with a choice of axle ratios. Traction control systems, both mechanical and electronic, are optional.

Mechanical traction control (1997–2006)

Both first and second generation Ford Expeditions (UN93 and U222) had an optional &quot;Traction-Lok&quot; rear limited-slip differential (LSD). The clutch packs inside the LSD tend to be weak, will wear over time, gradually losing their ability to transfer torque, and LSD will function like an open-type differential. The front differential on four-wheel drive models are open-type differential. The &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; electronic stability control for the 2003 model year. The Traction-Lok option was dropped after the 2006 model year, but a limited slip differential was reintroduced during the 2015 model year.

Electronic traction control (2003–present)

&quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; electronic stability control was introduced for the 2003 model year as an optional extra on the second generation Ford Expedition (U222). Bundled with the electronic stability control system is four-wheel electronic traction control (functions at all wheels) for Expeditions with four-wheel drive. Two-wheel drive Expeditions only receive two-wheel electronic traction control for rear wheels. &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot; was made standard equipment on all third generation Expeditions (U324).

The traction control system uses four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) to apply and release the disc brakes on the drive wheel that has lost traction. The ABS clamps down on the slipping drive wheel or wheels, &quot;brake locking&quot; the differential, which can transfer up to 100 percent of supplied torque to the opposing drive wheel with better traction. By ABS &quot;brake locking&quot; both the front &quot;and&quot; rear differentials, the traction control system can simulate front and rear differential locks. The system works even if two of its drive wheels (one front, one rear) are completely off the ground.

Using the ABS brakes rather than mechanical limited-slip or locking devices inside the axle differentials gives quicker response, more seamless performance, and enhanced durability.

===Terrain Management System (2018–present)===
Starting with the 2018 model year, the Expedition and Expedition MAX will utilize Ford&#x27;s Terrain Management System. Buttons to control the 4x4 system are arranged around the central Terrain Management dial. The system is similar to the one found in the 2011–present Explorer, however the Explorer&#x27;s system is more simplified. The Expedition&#x27;s Terrain Management System is adapted from the SVT Raptor to allow use of a 4L (low-lock) mode as well as an electronic locking rear differential. Moreover, the Explorer&#x27;s Terrain Management System has 4 (four) drive modes, while the Expedition has 7 (seven) drive modes, not including the 3 (three) 4x4 system direct drive modes.

Depending on the mode selected, Terrain Management will control, adjust, and fine tune the engine, transmission, center multi-disc differential lock, throttle response, four-wheel electronic traction control and electronic stability control (ESC) to adapt the SUV for optimal performance on the corresponding terrain.

==Towing capability==
When first introduced in 1996, the Expedition competed with both the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon in the full-size half-ton SUV towing segment. New competitors included the Dodge Durango (which was discontinued in 2009, but reintroduced as a crossover in 2011), Nissan Armada, and Toyota Sequoia. Product research conducted by Ford indicated that 92 percent of Expedition owners use the SUV for vacations. Some 60 percent use it to transport outdoor sports equipment, while 40 percent of Expedition owners use the vehicle for towing. The half-ton Expedition EL/Max competes with the half-ton Chevrolet Suburban 1500 and GMC Yukon XL 1500 in the towing segment.

Since its introduction, the Expedition&#x27;s braked trailer towing capacity has grown from to a current rating of when properly equipped. The list of towing features is also ever growing. Towing features common to all generations of the Expedition include: smallest possible turning radius for increased trailer maneuverability, large side view mirrors to improve rearward visibility, rearward-facing lane departure indicators which are helpful to other motorist when the Expedition is towing a long trailer providing added visual safety, heavy-duty flashers, heavy-duty large disc brakes to withstand prolonged braking while towing, and an available heavy-duty trailer towing package which includes necessary additions for heavy-duty towing.

As of the 2010 model year, the Expedition received trailer sway control (TSC) as standard equipment. TSC detects trailer oscillations and corrects it via asymmetrical ABS braking and reducing engine power until the Expedition and its trailer are both back under control.

===Heavy-duty trailer towing package===

Expeditions equipped with the heavy-duty trailer towing package are prepped and readied, at the factory, for towing. The package includes a VESC (Vehicle Equipment Safety Commission) V-5 (or SAE J684) Class IV (Class 4) rated trailer hitch with weight distribution capability, heavy-duty radiator, heavy-duty auxiliary transmission fluid cooler, and hitch mounted 4 and 7-pin trailer electrical connectors.

For model years prior to 2013, these Expeditions are prewired for later installation of an aftermarket electronic trailer brake controller. The brake controller wiring harness is located under the dash on the driver&#x27;s side. For the 2013 model year onward, these Expeditions are factory equipped with the TowCommand electronic trailer brake controller system. This features +/– gain brake adjustment with support for heavy-duty trailers with up to four axles (quad axle trailers) and is compatible with electrically actuated trailer drum brakes and electric-over-hydraulic (EOH) actuated trailer drum or disc brake systems. The trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the Expedition&#x27;s four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS), and trailer sway control (TSC).

Expeditions were offered with an adaptive pneumatic air-ride suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling capability from 1997 to 2013. For the 2014 model year, a Nivomat adaptive hydraulic suspension system with self leveling, payload leveling and trailer load leveling replaced the pneumatic system. Both systems can automatically detect when a heavy trailer is coupled, such as a travel trailer, and level the load. Additional ride-height sensors placed on the left and right sides of the SUV also monitor and compensate for any listing caused by improper cargo loading. This keeps the Expedition running straight and level while towing, and at night helps to keep the Expedition&#x27;s headlamps from blinding oncoming traffic.

==Special Service Vehicle==
To compete with large police SUVs that are sold by other automobile companies, primarily the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford has made a special version of the Expedition available to law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and EMS agencies. Ford calls it the Expedition Special Service Vehicle (SSV). The only differences between the standard Expedition and the Special Service Vehicle Expedition are provisions for emergency services related equipment such as radios, lightbars, and sirens.

With the fourth generation Expedition (2018–present) debuting in 2017, Ford announced that the standard size version will be sold to government agencies and law enforcement, available in the lower based XL trim only.
==Funkmaster Flex edition==

2008 was the only year for the Funkmaster Flex special edition Expedition. In 2005, Ford joined forces with rapper and New York City radio personality Funkmaster Flex in a multi-year partnership to create a series of special edition Ford vehicles and advertise the Ford brand. One of those creations was a 2008 Expedition bearing the rapper&#x27;s name. This limited production SUV featured a special Colorado Red and black two-tone paint job with orange pinstriping, 20 inch chrome wheels, 3D Carbon body kit, Funkmaster Flex badging and a custom black and Colorado Red leather interior on top of Expedition &quot;Limited&quot; standard equipment. The FMF Expedition went on sale at Ford dealerships in the fall of 2007 and production was limited to 650 units total.

==Reception==
&quot;Motor Trend&quot; gave the 2018 Expedition a good review in its February 14, 2018 article, in which they cite the vehicle&#x27;s “blend of performance (both on- and off-road), comfort, utility, and tech [that] easily make it the new benchmark for the full-size SUV class.” However the review notes that there were a few drawbacks in terms of hp acceleration (coming in second to the 2018 Nissan Armada but ahead of the 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe), off-road performance, and its MPG estimate.

The 2018 Expedition also ranked first among large SUVs with a score of 9.3 from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Awards==
The fourth-generation Ford Expedition was nominated at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in the Truck of the Year category, only to lose out to its co-branded cousin Lincoln Navigator. The Expedition was runner-up. Consumer Reports added the short-wheelbase Expedition to its recommended list for 2020, citing improved reliability and owner satisfaction scores.

==Recalls==
The 2020 Expeditions were recalled in April 2020 over a front passenger safety belt sensor defect, which may malfunction and can lead to a misclassification of the size and weight of the occupant for the restraint system. In some circumstances, this malfunction may not be detected, and the airbag light may not illuminate, leading to injuries if it failed to deploy. The recall affects the 1,368 produced Expeditions (1,355 in the United States, 12 in Canada, and 1 in Mexico) that were built at the Ford Kentucky Truck Plant from November 27 to December 7, 2019.

<text>The Ford Excursion is a heavy-duty (Class 2) SUV marketed by Ford Motor Company from 2000 through 2005. At its introduction, the Excursion was the longest and heaviest SUV ever to enter mass production. The third Ford SUV was derived from the F-Series pickup trucks (after the Ford Bronco and the Ford Expedition), and the model line used a heavier-duty chassis and frame than the Expedition; both vehicles competed against the Chevrolet Suburban.

Developed as a competitor for the 2500-series (-ton) Chevrolet Suburban/GMC Yukon XL, the Ford Excursion was derived from the -ton F-250 Super Duty pickup truck (sharing its chassis with the regular cab, long-bed chassis). The model line was produced for a single generation; a shortened 2006 model year was offered exclusively for Mexico. Targeting the North American market, only a few were produced for export. The Excursion remains the largest mass-produced SUV (matched in length by the 2023 introduction of the lighter Jeep Grand Wagoneer L); currently, only the GMC Hummer EV SUV is heavier.

The Excursion was assembled at its Kentucky Truck Plant (Louisville, Kentucky) alongside the Ford Super Duty line. The last example was produced on September 30, 2005. For 2007, Ford introduced the extended-length Ford Expedition EL/MAX (today, Expedition MAX), competing more closely against the 1500-series Suburban in capability.

==Origin and concept==
For the 1973 model year, General Motors redesigned its Suburban utility wagon (sold by Chevrolet and GMC dealers) as part of its Rounded-Line C/K trucks. A fourth passenger door was added, allowing the model line to compete directly against the similar-size International Harvester Travelall wagon for the first time. Following the 1975 discontinuation of the Travelall, the Suburban became the only wagon-style full-size SUV (a distinction it would hold until the 1997 introduction of the Expedition), competing primarily against the smaller Jeep Wagoneer.

For 1978, the second-generation Ford Bronco was released, becoming a full-size SUV. To compete against the Chevrolet K5 Blazer/GMC Jimmy and Dodge Ramcharger, the Bronco adopted design commonality with the contemporary Ford F-100 pickup truck while retaining its previous body style: a three-door half-cab wagon with a lift-off hardtop (a configuration also used by the Blazer/Jimmy). In contrast to the Rounded-Line pickup trucks serving as the basis for the K5 Blazer and the Suburban (which shared much of its bodywork with crew-cab pickup trucks), Ford did not develop a five-door station wagon body from its trucks.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Ford marketed four-door versions of the Bronco on a special-order basis. License-built by second-party manufacturers, the designs mated the rear body of the Bronco to crew-cab F-Series bodywork. Examples used the 1-ton F-350 chassis (a first since the IHC Travelall) as a basis. In contrast to the Suburban, offered with ½-ton or ¾-ton payload

For 1997, Ford released the Ford Expedition as its all-new SUV derived from the Ford F-150 (itself redesigned the same year). Nearly matching the International Travelall in size, the Expedition adopted a five-door wagon configuration, sized between the Chevrolet Tahoe (replacing the K5 Blazer) and the Suburban (offering the three-row interior seating of the latter).

For 1999, Ford expanded the F-Series model range, with the Super Duty series including the F-250 and F-350 (and all larger Ford trucks). The Super Duty F-Series trucks received a heavier-duty chassis, suspension, and distinct body design. Coinciding with the development of the Super Duty series, Ford commenced development of a heavy-duty SUV derived from the -ton F-250 Super Duty, intended to compete against the higher-payload 2500-series Suburban (itself based on a -ton pickup truck chassis).

==Design overview==
The Ford Excursion was introduced for the 2000 model year on September 30, 1999. In contrast to the Expedition (which replaced the Bronco), the Excursion had no direct predecessor in the Ford truck line. The model line is outranked in length (both body and wheelbase) and height by the Ford E-350 12/15-passenger van.

===Chassis===
The Ford Excursion shares many body and chassis assemblies with its F-250 pickup truck counterpart. The front suspension and most of the rear suspension were common components, but the Excursion was fitted with different leaf springs and front spring hanger brackets. The Excursion had a distinct frame which differed from the front sway bar mounts rearward, making the model taller and wider than its pickup truck counterpart.

The rear axle for all Excursions was a Sterling 10.5 axle. The four-wheel-drive models had an NV273 transfer case and Dana 50 front axle. Rear axle ratios of 3.73:1 and 4.30:1 were offered.

During the development of the chassis, Ford learned that its initial design caused smaller vehicles (such as a Ford Taurus) to become severely overridden in a head-on collision. In the test, the tire of the Excursion drove up to the windshield of the Taurus (reducing the chance of survival for its driver). As a response, Ford modified the chassis to include an under-bumper &quot;blocker beam&quot;; a safety device the French transportation ministry initially tested in 1971. A trailer hitch was standard equipment to help reduce underriding in rear-end collisions by smaller vehicles.

==== Powertrain ====
During its entire production, the Excursion was offered with both gasoline and diesel engines. The standard gasoline engine was a 5.4 L Triton V8; a 6.8 L Triton V10 was offered as an option. At its launch, the optional diesel engine was the Navistar-produced 7.3 L Power Stroke V8; during 2003 production, a Navistar-produced 6.0 L diesel V8 was introduced, again using the Power Stroke name.

All four engines were paired with an automatic transmission. The 4-speed 4R100 automatic was fitted to the 5.4 L, 6.8 L, and 7.3 L engines, with a 5-speed 5R110W automatic fitted to the 6.0 L engine.

Though using the -ton chassis of the F-250, the two-wheel-drive Excursion was rated with a GVWR of when equipped with gasoline engines and when equipped with diesel engines (four-wheel-drive models have a higher GVWR with either engine). As its GVWR was above , the Excursion was exempt from EPA fuel economy ratings; reviewers cited fuel economy in the range of 12-15 mpg with the V10 gasoline engine. While its GVWR exempted it from emissions standards applied to light-duty vehicles, Ford designed the powertrains of the Excursion to meet low-emissions vehicle (LEV) status.

===Body design===
While the smaller Ford Expedition shared design elements with the popular Ford F-150, the Excursion adopted a high degree of commonality from its F-250 counterpart. Except for its egg-crate grille (styled similarly to the Expedition and the third-generation Explorer), the Excursion shares its front bodywork forward of the B-pillars with its pickup truck counterpart. From the B-pillar rearward, the Excursion is designed with model-distinct bodywork. Along with rear passenger doors specific to the model line (including forward-tilted C-pillars instead of the rectangular design from the pickup truck), the rear wagon body is styled similarly to the 1980-1996 Bronco (with flush-mounted glass). In place of a conventional liftgate, Ford designed the rear cargo door with a three-way layout (similar to the 1992–2005 Chevrolet Astro), pairing a framed upper window (with rear wiper) with two lower &quot;Dutch doors&quot;; the Excursion sourced its taillamps directly from the E-Series van. For 2005, the egg-crate grille was replaced by the grille used by Super Duty pickup trucks.

Sharing its dashboard entirely from the F-250 (though adding an &quot;Excursion&quot; nameplate badge), the interior was offered in either 8 or 9-passenger seating (with either a front bench seat or front bucket seats). As with the Bronco, Ford mounted the spare tire vertically in the cargo area (behind the third-row seat). For 2002, the instrument panel underwent minor revisions (receiving a digital odometer and a transmission temperature gauge); seating materials underwent revisions.

Coinciding with its design commonality with the Ford Super Duty crew cab, the Excursion was a mass-produced SUV with four full-length passenger doors. Along with the Chevrolet Suburban (and its GMC/Cadillac counterparts) and the International Travelall, the only mass-produced model lines with the design feature are the Ford Expedition Max/Lincoln Navigator L and the Jeep (Grand) Wagoneer L.

=== Trim ===
The Excursion adopted the trim nomenclature of the Ford light trucks marketed in North America. The base trim was XL (marketed nearly exclusively for fleet sales), XLT (standard trim in retail markets), and Limited (highest trim line). Following its use across many Ford light trucks, an Eddie Bauer trim package was introduced for the Excursion for 2003 (differing from the Limited primarily in appearance).

XLT: Included three rows of seating, leather-wrapped steering wheel with speed control, a security system, keyless entry, chrome steel rims or optional alloy rims, trailer towing package, an AM/FM radio with cassette and single-disc CD player with six premium speakers, and air conditioning.

Limited: Included same features as XLT, but adds a power driver&#x27;s seat, rear audio controls, illuminated running boards, alloy rims, front-speed sensitive windshield wipers, five power points, ten cupholders, leather seats (with heated first row), and an optional rear entertainment system with DVD player.

==Reception==
Being launched on September 30, 1999, the 2000 Ford Excursion was described by Popular Science as the &quot;biggest sport utility on the planet.&quot; This would be the most successful model year for the Excursion, with nearly 69,000 examples sold. After essentially meeting sales projections at its launch, demand dropped in part because of the energy crisis of the 2000s. Annual production capacity was 70,000, but sales from 2001 barely reach half that number and the model become the lowest-selling SUV marketed by Ford or Lincoln-Mercury.

The large size of the Excursion led to it being dubbed the &quot;Ford Valdez&quot; by Martin Short of the Sierra Club in 1999 (in reference to the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; supertanker). In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; selected it as one of the &quot;Fifty Worst Cars of All Time.&quot;

==Variants==

===F-250 Tropivan===
From 1998 to 2012, an aftermarket SUV conversion of the Ford F-250 was sold in Brazil. Similar in design and layout to the Excursion, the F-250 Tropivan differed primarily by its assembly as a second-party conversion (similar to the Centurion Classic). In contrast to the Excursion, two different wheelbases of the Tropivan were produced.

As with all Super Duty trucks in Brazil, the Tropivan had a different engine selection throughout its production run, including a 4.2 L Essex gasoline V6 and two types of diesels: a 3.9 L Cummins B-series and the 4.2 L MWM Sprint 6.07TCA straight-6.

===Aftermarket===
During and since its production, the Excursion has become a basis for several types of aftermarket vehicles. As a result of its body commonality with the Super Duty model range, the bodywork of the Excursion led to aftermarket conversions of Ford medium-duty truck chassis (Ford F-650 and F-750) to SUVs; to accommodate the longer wheelbase, the body was typically modified with an extra set of doors.

At the other end of the size scale, the Hennessey VelociRaptor SUV was created by mating the rear bodywork of the Excursion with the bodywork of the first-generation Ford Raptor (a practice similar to the creation of the 1990s Centurion Classic C350).

Because the Excursion shares significant design commonality with the 1999 through 2016 Ford F-250, the SUV has been customized by replacing the 2000-2005 front bodywork with the bodywork of 2008–2016 Super Duty pickup trucks. 

The Excursion also has served as a basis for stretch limousines. Though Ford imposed a 120-inch length limit on body extensions (on full-frame cars such as the Lincoln Town Car), some Excursions have undergone longer extensions.

<text>Balmer is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater. Only the heavily worn southern and eastern sections of the crater still survive; the remainder being overlaid by a lava flow that joins to the nearby mare. Balmer lies to the east-southeast of the crater Vendelinus.

Balmer was considered a Constellation Region of Interest. Light plains deposits overly mare basalt, as evidenced by multiple dark-halo craters.

<text>Kevin Murphy (9 April 1937 – 5 March 2012) was an Irish civil servant who served as Ombudsman from 1994 to 2003 and Information Commissioner from 1998 to 2003.

==Career==
He was educated at Synge Street CBS before joining the civil service in 1955.

Murphy served in the Department of Industry and Commerce, in the Department of Finance, and joined the newly created Department of the Public Service in 1973. He became Secretary-General of the latter in 1983. In 1987, he was appointed Secretary-General, Public Service Management and Development, at the Department of Finance, when the functions of the Department of the Public Service were transferred.

On 1 November 1994, Murphy was appointed as Ombudsman by the president, Mary Robinson, upon nomination by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In this position, he dealt with complaints against government departments, local authorities, and other public bodies. Under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, he also held the office of Information Commissioner from April 1998. The Information Commissioner may review decisions of public bodies in relation to requests for access to information.

He was nominated for a second term in 2000. Before his retirement, he wrote a commentary on the government&#x27;s amendments to Freedom of Information Act. Michael McDowell, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, criticised him for straying across the line.

In June 2003, Emily O&#x27;Reilly succeeded him in both posts. Although Murphy retired from employment in 2002 when he turned 65, he continued in public life, including sitting on a committee to appoint members of the new Irish Press commission in 2006.

==Personal life==
Murphy was educated at Synge Street CBS.

He was married with four children and died 6 March 2012, aged 75.

<doc id="954760" wikidata="Q2109733" url="?curid=954760" title="Apollo PGNCS">
<text>The Apollo primary guidance, navigation, and control system (PGNCS, pronounced &quot;pings&quot;) was a self-contained inertial guidance system that allowed Apollo spacecraft to carry out their missions when communications with Earth were interrupted, either as expected, when the spacecraft were behind the Moon, or in case of a communications failure. The Apollo command module (CM) and lunar module (LM), were each equipped with a version of PGNCS. PGNCS, and specifically its computer, were also the command center for all system inputs from the LM, including the alignment optical telescope, the radar system, the manual translation and rotation device inputs by the astronauts as well as other inputs from the LM systems.

PGNCS was developed by the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory under the direction of Charles Stark Draper (the Instrumentation Laboratory was later named after him). The prime contractor for PGNCS and manufacturer of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) was the Delco Division of General Motors. PGNCS consisted of the following components:

*an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
*the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)
*resolvers to convert inertial platform angles to signals usable for servo control
*optical units, one for the CM and a different one for the LM
*a mechanical frame, called the navigation base (or navbase), to rigidly connect the optical devices and, in the LM, the rendezvous radar to the IMU
*the AGC software

==Versions==
The CM and LM used the same computer, inertial platform and resolvers. The main difference was the optical unit. The navbase was different for each spacecraft as well, reflecting the differing mounting geometries. The LM&#x27;s rendezvous radar was also connected to its navbase.

There were two versions of PGNCS—Block I and Block II—corresponding to the two generations of the CM. After the Apollo 1 fire, which occurred in a Block I CM, NASA decided that no further crewed missions would use Block I, though uncrewed missions did. Major differences between Block I and Block II PGNCS included replacing electromechanical resolvers with an all electronic design and replacing the Block I navbase, which was machined from beryllium, with a frame built out of aluminum tubing filled with polyurethane foam. The Block II navbases were lighter, cheaper, and just as rigid.

Another major difference between Block I and Block II was repairability. An original goal for the Apollo program was for the astronauts to be able to make repairs to the electronics. Accordingly, the Block 1 PNGCS was designed with many identical modules that could be replaced with spares, if necessary, in flight. However high humidity conditions inside the crew compartments and accidents in handling body fluids during the Gemini 7 mission made having unsealed electrical connections undesirable. The repairability goal was eliminated in Block II and all units and electrical connections were sealed. The fatal Apollo 1 fire reinforced this concern.

==Inertial measurement unit==
The IMU was gimbaled on three axes. The innermost part, the stable member (SM), was a 6-inch beryllium cube, with three gyroscopes and three accelerometers mounted in it. Feedback loops used signals from the gyroscopes by way of the resolvers to control motors at each axis. This servo system kept the stable member fixed with respect to inertial space. Signals from the accelerometers were then integrated to keep track of the spacecraft&#x27;s velocity and position. The IMU was derived from the guidance system developed by Draper for the Polaris missile.

Inertial guidance systems are not perfect and Apollo system drifted about one milliradian per hour. Thus it was necessary to realign the inertial platform periodically by sighting on stars.

==Optical units==

The CM optical unit had a precision sextant (SXT) fixed to the IMU frame that could measure angles between stars and Earth or Moon landmarks or the horizon. It had two lines of sight, 28× magnification and a 1.8° field of view. The optical unit also included a low-magnification wide field of view (60°) scanning telescope (SCT) for star sightings. The optical unit could be used to determine CM position and orientation in space. 
The LM instead had an alignment optical telescope (AOT), essentially a periscope. The outer element of the AOT was a sun-shielded prism that could be rotated to one of six fixed positions relative to the LM, in order to cover a large portion of the lunar sky. Each position had a 60° field of view. When rotated, the AOT&#x27;s position was readable by the AGC; by pointing the reticule at two different stars, the computer could determine the craft&#x27;s orientation.

Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Michael Collins noted that the visibility through the optics was sub-standard, and it was difficult to see through in certain lighting conditions.

The sun shade was added late in the program, in 1967, after tests and modeling determined that the astronauts might not be able to see stars on the lunar surface due to direct sun light or light scattered by near-by parts of the LM impinging on the outside prism. Adding the sun shade also allowed increasing the number of view positions from three to six.

==Software==
The onboard guidance software used a Kalman filter to merge new data with past position measurements to produce an optimal position estimate for the spacecraft. The key information was a coordinate transformation between the IMU stable member and the reference coordinate system. In the argot of the Apollo program this matrix was known as REFSMMAT (for &quot;Reference to Stable Member Matrix&quot;). There were two reference coordinate systems used, depending on the phase of the mission: One centered on Earth and one centered on the Moon.

==Navigational information==
Despite the word &quot;primary&quot; in its name, PGNCS data was not the main source of navigation information. Tracking data from NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network was processed by computers at Mission Control, using least squares algorithms. The position and velocity estimates that resulted were more accurate than those produced by PGNCS. As a result, the astronauts were periodically given state vector updates to enter into the AGC, based on ground data. PGNCS was still essential to maintain spacecraft orientation, to control rockets during maneuvering burns, including lunar landing and take off, and as the prime source of navigation data during planned and unexpected communications outages. PGNCS also provided a check on ground data.

The lunar module had a third means of navigation, the abort guidance system (AGS), built by TRW. This was to be used in the event of failure of PGNCS. The AGS could be used to take off from the Moon, and to rendezvous with the Command Module, but not for landing. During Apollo 13, after the most critical burn near the Moon, the AGS was used in place of PGNCS because it required less electrical power and cooling water.

== Apollo 11 ==
During the Apollo 11 mission, two PGNCS alarms (1201 &quot;No VAC areas available&quot; and 1202 &quot;Executive alarm, no core sets&quot;) were relayed to mission control as the first lunar landing was being attempted on July 20, 1969. The computer system overload was caused by the simultaneous capture of landing radar data and rendezvous radar data. Support staff at Mission control concluded that the alarms could be safely ignored and the landing succeeded.

<text>Word Records is a Christian faith-based entertainment company based in Nashville, Tennessee. It is owned by Curb Records, and is a part of Word Entertainment. It is distributed by Warner Records (the former Warner Bros. Records).

== History ==
In 1951, Word Records was established in Waco, Texas by Jarrell McCracken, Baylor business major Henry SoRelle and radio/television executive Ted Snider. The label&#x27;s name is based on a 16-minute spoken word recording written and narrated by McCracken, the first recording released by the label, entitled &quot;The Game of Life&quot;. The 23-year-old KWTX sportscaster in Waco had read an article by Jimmy Allen, a former athlete who became a Baptist preacher, and based his recording on the article which is also called &quot;The Game of Life&quot;. The event is based on a full-length match, between the forces of good and evil, with Jesus Christ and Satan coaching the two teams. McCracken was familiar with play-by-play broadcasting, having created virtual baseball games for radio broadcast based on wire reports. McCracken originally presented &quot;The Game of Life&quot; on Sunday nights, at various churches around the central Texas area. Everywhere he presented &quot;The Game of Life&quot;, he got requests for copies. Eventually, he had a short run of records pressed to offer at churches where he spoke. The fictional radio station in the recording has the call letters &quot;WORD&quot;, which was printed on the label of the custom record. After being asked by a friend when he was going to release a follow-up, McCracken then decided to pursue the label on a more serious level.

Subsequent records focused on other spoken word recordings, but Word soon branched out into southern gospel music. Early employees for the label included Tom Norfleet, Kurt Kaiser and Ralph Carmichael.

The label struggled initially until Marvin Norcross became an equity partner. By 1954, Word had become a publishing house as well.

Several subsidiary labels were started over the years: Canaan Records in the 1960s, Myrrh Records in 1972, DaySpring Records in 1977, and Rejoice Records in the 1980s. Two of these labels no longer exist in their original form. The Myrrh label was resurrected in 2005, as a praise and worship record label, Myrrh Worship. Canaan Records was also re-opened in early 2007, with Dave Clark at the helm.

Larry Norman&#x27;s Solid Rock Records had a distribution deal with Word, from 1975 to 1980. Artists on Solid Rock included Norman, Randy Stonehill, Daniel Amos, Tom Howard and Mark Heard.

In 1983, Chris Christian signed a distribution deal, to move his label Home Sweet Home Records from Benson Records to Word Records. It is still active, and remains under the independent ownership of Chris Christian.

Light Records was distributed in the 1970s by Word Records, before being sold to Ralph Carmichael in the 1980s.

Reunion Records signed a distribution and promotion contract in the 1980s. The agreement lasted well into the 1990s. Today, Reunion Records is distributed through Provident Label Group.

Star Song Communications was distributed by Word Records, but left their distribution deal in the late 1980s to sign with Sparrow Records, which was taken over by Chordant Distribution and then by EMI.

Distribution deals with other labels in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s allowed Word Records to rise to the top, virtually housing a who&#x27;s-who in Christian music. They distributed, promoted and advertised the biggest names in contemporary Christian music. Artists included: Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, Rich Mullins, Russ and Tori Taff, Benny Hester, Paul Smith, the Imperials, Petra, Helen Baylor, Sandi Patti, Kenny Marks, Wayne Watson, Carman, the Archers featuring Steve Archer, White Heart, Gaither Vocal Band, Bill Gaither Trio, Point of Grace, Love Song, Sweet Comfort Band, the Nelons, Happy Goodman Family featuring Rusty Goodman, Florida Boys, Guardian, Phil and Brenda Nicholas and other artists.

In the 1976, McCracken sold part interest in his label to the American Broadcasting Company. 10 years later, ABC merged with Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. and forced McCracken out of the company.

From 1984 to 1990, Word was distributed in the general market by A&amp;M Records, and then by Epic Records until 2002.

In 1992, Capital Cities/ABC sold Word to Thomas Nelson, Inc. for $72 million, and Nelson made two major changes—developing the present swirling &quot;W&quot; logo for book products which was unveiled in 1995. Headquarters moved from Waco, Texas, to its present headquarters in Nashville, Tennessee. Nelson split the record label and book publishing arms in 1996, when the labels were sold to Gaylord Entertainment. In an agreement with Gaylord, Thomas Nelson continued to use the &quot;Word Publishing&quot; name for its book imprint until 2002, at which time it became &quot;W Publishing Group&quot; and retained the swirling &quot;W&quot; logo. A highly controversial ad campaign introduced at the CBA convention in 2002, created litigation and settled later.

After Colin Reed took over Gaylord Entertainment in 2001, the hotelier made corporate changes at the company, including the ousting of longstanding president Roland Lundy. The Word Entertainment group was sold to then-AOL Time Warner in 2002. That same year, former Atlantic Records Christian division manager Barry Landis briefly took the position of president of the label group division. Word went through a period of restructuring, closing their Los Angeles music publishing office, absorbing Myrrh Records, Squint Entertainment, and Everland Entertainment into the Word Label Group, and reducing in-house staff. Curb Records also gained a stake in the company during this time. In 2004, the company was sold again as part of Time Warner divestiture of its music division, selling it to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. to form a newly independent Warner Music Group.

In March 2016, it was announced that Mike Curb acquired 100% of Word Entertainment (excluding the print music division) from Warner Music Group. However, WMG has continued to distribute Word&#x27;s output for the general market. The print music division (Word Music and Church Resources), excluding Word Publishing, was subsequently acquired by The Lorenz Corporation in February 2017.

<text>Biot is a small, bowl-shaped lunar impact crater located in the southern reaches of the Mare Fecunditatis. It is named after French astronomer Jean-Baptiste Biot. It is a circular formation with a sharp-edged rim that has not been significantly worn. The inner walls slope down to a relatively small interior floor. The albedo of the wide inner walls is higher than the surrounding lunar mare, giving it a light hue. To the southeast is the crater Wrottesley.

==Satellite craters==
By convention, these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Biot.

<text>The Planctomycetota are a phylum of widely distributed bacteria, occurring in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They play a considerable role in global carbon and nitrogen cycles, with many species of this phylum capable of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, also known as anammox. Many Planctomycetota occur in relatively high abundance as biofilms, often associating with other organisms such as macroalgae and marine sponges.

Planctomycetota are included in the PVC superphylum along with Verrucomicrobiota, Chlamydiota, Lentisphaerota, Kiritimatiellaeota, and &quot;Candidatus&quot; &quot;Omnitrophica&quot;. The phylum Planctomycetota is composed of the classes Planctomycetia and Phycisphaerae. First described in 1924, members of the Planctomycetota were identified as eukaryotes and were only later described as bacteria in 1972. Early examination of members of the Planctomycetota suggested a cell plan differing considerably from other bacteria, although they are now confirmed as Gram-negative bacteria, but with many unique characteristics.

Bacteria in the Planctomycetota are often small, spherical cells, but a large amount of morphological variation is seen. Members of the Planctomycetota also display distinct reproductive habits, with many species dividing by budding, in contrast to all other free-living bacteria, which divide by binary fission.

Interest is growing in the Planctomycetota regarding biotechnology and human applications, mainly as a source of bioactive molecules. In addition, some Planctomycetota were recently described as human pathogens.
The species &quot;Gemmata obscuriglobus&quot; has been identified specifically as comprising bacteria with unique characteristics among the Planctomycetota, such as their ability to synthesize sterols.
==Structure and morphology==

=== Cell shape and appendages ===

The distinct morphological characteristics of bacteria in the Planctomycetota have been discussed extensively. The common morphology is often spherical cells roughly 2 μm in diameter, as observed in the species &quot;Aquisphaera giovannonii&quot;. However, the diversity in cell shape often varies greatly in them. Ovoid and pear-shaped cells have been described in some species, and often occur in rosettes of three to 10 cells. &quot;Gemmata obscuriglobus&quot; is a well studied species in the Planctomycetota with spherical cells. In contrast, bacteria in the species &quot;Planctopirus limnophila&quot; have ovoid cells.

Many Planctomycetota species display structures and appendages on the outer surface of the cell. Flagella, common in most bacteria, have also been observed in the species &quot;P. limnophila.&quot; Many Planctomycetota also have a holdfast, or stalk, which attaches the cell to a surface or substrate. Members of some species, though, such as &quot;Isosphaera pallida&quot; lack a holdfast.

Unique appendages known as crateriform structures have been observed in species of Planctomycetota belonging to the class Planctomycetia. The outer surface of cells in the species &quot;P. limnophila&quot; display both large and small crateriform structures. Large crateriform structures often cover the cell surface, while small crateriform structures are often only at the end of the cell. Light microscopy demonstrated fibers of both stalk and pili type in &quot;P. limnophila&quot; and &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot;. The pili fibers in both these species were often associated with large crateriform structures; in contrast, the stalk fibers were associated with small crateriform structures.

=== Cell wall composition ===
Early examination of the Planctomycetota suggested that their cell plan differed considerably from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Until recently, bacteria in the Planctomycetota were thought to lack peptidoglycans in their cell walls, and were instead suggested to have proteinaceous cell walls. Peptidoglycan is an essential polymer of glycans, present in all free-living bacteria, and its rigidity helps maintain integrity of the cell. Peptidoglycan synthesis is also essential during cell division. Recently, those in the species &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot; were found to have peptidoglycan in their cell walls.

=== Internal cell composition ===
Planctomycetota were once thought to display distinct compartmentalization within the cytosol. Three-dimensional electron tomography reconstruction of &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot; displayed varying interpretations of this suggested compartmentalization. The cytosol was suggested to be separated into compartments, both the paryphoplasm and pirellulosome, by an intracytoplasmic membrane. This interpretation has since been demonstrated to be incorrect. In fact, the intracytoplasmic membrane is well known to be the cytoplasmic membrane which displays unique invaginations, giving the appearance of compartmentalization within the cytosol. Planctomycetota therefore display the two compartments typical of Gram-negative bacteria, the cytoplasm and periplasm.

The excess membrane observed in &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot; triples the surface area of the cell relative to its volume, which is suggested to be associated with sterol synthesis.
=== Pigments ===
Many Planctomycetota species display pink or orange coloring, suggested to result from the production of carotenoid pigments. Carotenoids are produced by plants and fungi, and by some heterotrophic bacteria to protect against oxidative stress. Three different carotenoid pigments have been identified in two different strains of the Planctomycetota. 

In marine environments, Planctomycetota are often suspended in the water column or present as biofilms on the surface of macroalgae, and are often exposed to harmful ultraviolet radiation. More highly pigmented species of the Planctomycetota are more resistant to ultraviolet radiation, although this is not yet well understood. It has since been shown that Planctomycetota synthesize C30 carotenoids from squalene and that this squalene route to C30 carotenoids is the most widespread in prokaryotes.

=== Unique characteristics of anammox cells ===
Bacteria in the Planctomycetota that are anammox-capable form the order Brocadiales. The cells of anammox bacteria are often coccoid with a diameter of about 0.8 μm, and are suggested to contain three compartments, each surrounded by a membrane. The outer membrane encloses the cell and the protoplasm and the innermost membrane surrounds the anammoxosome, the central structure of anammox bacteria. The anammoxosome membrane is largely composed of unusual ladderane-based lipids.

== Life history and reproduction ==

=== Growth ===
Planctomycetota species grow slowly, when compared to other bacteria, often forming rosette structures of 3-5 cells. The species &quot;P. limnophila&quot; is suggested to be relatively fast growing, with a doubling time of roughly 6-14 days. In contrast, some other Planctomycetota have doubling times of around 30 days. Their high abundance in many ecosystems is surprising, given their slow growth rates.

=== Lifecycle ===
Planctomycetota often perform a lifestyle switch between both a sessile stalked stage and a free-swimming stage. Members of the species &quot;P. limnophila&quot; perform a lifestyle switch that is often associated with cell division. The sessile mother cell produces a free-swimming daughter cell. The daughter cell must then attach to a surface before starting the cycle over again. However, not all of the Planctomycetota have a motile stage, and the lifestyle switch observed in many species may not be common among all Planctomycetota.
=== Reproduction ===
The current understanding of bacterial cell division is based on model organisms such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. The dominant form of reproduction observed in almost all bacteria is cell division by binary fission, which involves the synthesis of both peptidoglycans and proteins known as FtsZ. In contrast, many bacteria in the Planctomycetota divide by budding.

FtsZ proteins are suggested to be similar in structure to that of tubulin, the protein present in eukaryotes, and is essential for septal formation during cell division. The lack of FtsZ proteins is often lethal. Peptidoglycan also play a considerable role in cell division by binary fission.

Planctomycetota is one of the only known phyla whose members lack FtsZ proteins. Bacteria in the Chlamydiales, also a member of the PVC superphylum, also lack FtsZ. Although bacteria in the Planctomycetota lack FtsZ, two distinct modes of cell division have been observed. Most Planctomycetota divide by binary fission, mainly species of the class Phycisphaerae. In contrast, species of the class Planctomycetia divide by budding.

The mechanisms involved in budding have been described extensively for yeast cells. However, bacterial budding observed in Planctomycetota is still poorly understood. Budding has been observed in both radial symmetric cells, such as bacteria in the species &quot;P. limnophila&quot;, and axially symmetric cells. During cell division in members of &quot;P. limnophila&quot;, the daughter cells originate from the region opposite to the pole with the holdfast or stalk.

Considerable diversity has been observed in cell division among bacteria in the Planctomycetota. During cell division in &quot;Fuerstia marisgermanicae&quot;, a tubular structure is connected from the bud to the mother cell. The species &quot;Kolteria novifilia&quot; forms a distinct clade of Planctomycetota, and is the only known species to divide by lateral budding at the middle of the cell. Lastly, members of the clade Saltatorellus are capable of switching between both binary fission and budding.

==Genetic characteristics==

=== Molecular signatures ===
Planctomycetota are known for their unusual cellular characteristics, and their distinctness from all other bacteria is additionally supported by the shared presence of two conserved signature indels (CSIs). These CSIs demarcate the group from neighboring phyla within the PVC group. An additional CSI has been found that is shared by all Planctomycetota species, with the exception of &quot;Kuenenia stuttgartiensis.&quot; This supports the idea that &quot;K. stuttgartiensis&quot; forms a deep branch within the Planctomycetota phylum.

A CSI has also been found to be shared by the entire PVC superphylum, including the Planctomycetota. Planctomycetota also contain an important conserved signature protein that has been characterized to play an important housekeeping function that is exclusive to members belonging to the PVC superphylum.

=== General characteristics ===
The genome size of &quot;Rhodopirellula baltica&quot; has been estimated to be over 7 million bases, making it one of the largest prokaryotic genomes sequenced. Extensive genome duplication takes up about 25% of the genome sequence. This may be a way for the organism to adapt to mutations, allowing for redundancy if a part of the genome is damaged. The polymerase chain reaction primer used often mismatches with the genes, creating difficulty when sequencing the genome. 

When comparing under a microscope, a defining characteristic for some Planctomycetota is that a single unlinked rRNA operon can be identified near the origin. The changes of genetic material is through internal chromosomal inversion, and not through lateral gene transfer. This creates a way of diversification in the Planctomycetota variants as multiple transposon genes in these regions have reverse orientation that transfers to rearrangements. 

Some Planctomycetota thrive in regions containing highly concentrated nitrate, and have genes that are required for heterotactic acid fermentation. The enzyme lactate dehydrogenase plays a key role in this process. The genetic process also has ultraviolet radiation protection response, and is associated with the genes &quot;recA, lexA, uvrA, uvrB,&quot; and&quot; uvrC&quot;, in addition to a photolyase gene that is expressed when the environment offers excessive ultraviolet radiation stress. Other stress responses include the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and oxidation. 

Many Planctomycetota also express sulfatase genes. The genome of &quot;Pirellula&quot; sp. strain 1 incorporates 110 genes that contribute to encoding proteins that produce sulfatase enzymes. In comparison with a different species of prokaryotic, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&quot; only 6 sulfatases occur and the genes that express these proteins are contained as two to five pairs, usually clustered in 22 groups.

=== Molecular evolution ===
Planctomycetota originate from within the Bacteria and these similarities between proteins in Planctomycetales and eukaryotes reflect convergent evolution. Gained protein families in Gemmataceae, a subgroup within Planctomycetota, have low sequence similarity to eukaryotic proteins; however, they show highest sequence similarity to other Gemmataceae protein families.

There is massive emergence of novel protein families within the Gemmataceae. More than one thousand protein families were acquired by duplications and domain rearrangements. The new paralogs function in signal transduction, regulatory systems, and protein interaction pathways. They are related to the functional organisation of the cell, which can be interpreted as an adaptation to a more complex lifestyle. The protein length is longer in the Gemmataceae than in most other bacteria and the genes have linkers. There is an overlap between the longest proteins in Planctomycetales and the shortest proteins in eukaryotes. In the terms of gene paralogy, protein length, and protein domain structures, prokaryotes and eukaryotes do not have sharp boundaries.

== Phylogeny ==

Originally classified as a eukaryote due to morphology, the advent of genetic sequencing allowed researchers to agree that the Planctomycetota belong to the domain Bacteria. Within that domain, Planctomycetota are classified as their own phylum, however, other researchers have argued they could also be categorized as part of a larger superphylum entitled PVC, which would encompass the phyla Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae and Lentisphaerae, and the candidate phylum &quot;&quot;Candidatus&quot; Omnitrophica&quot;. Within this superphylum, its members have been found to be closely related through the creation of 16S rRNA trees. Both the Planctomycetota and Chlamydiota encode proteins for nucleotide transporters, and the Verrucomicrobiota have also been found to have features common among eukaryotic cells. Thus, a common ancestor of this superphylum may have been the start of the eukaryotic lineage. While this is one possible explanation, because PVC is not the start of the bacterial tree, the existence of eukaryotic traits and genes is more likely explained through lateral gene transfer, and not a more recent eukaryotic ancestor. 

== Ecology ==

=== Distribution and abundance ===
Members of the Planctomycetota are found in a diverse range of environments, both geographically and ecologically, and occur in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In aquatic environments, they are found in both freshwater and marine systems. Planctomycetota were originally believed to exist exclusively in aquatic environments, but they are now known to be also abundant in soils and hypersaline environments. They are widespread on five continents, including Antarctica and Australia.

Fluorescence &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization was used to detect Planctomycetota in various environments, and Planctomycetota are found in abundance in sphagnum bogs. Some Planctomycetota were found in the digestive systems of marine lifeforms, while others tend to live among eukaryotes.

=== Environmental influences on distribution ===
Planctomycetota account for roughly 11% of prokaryotic communities in marine systems, and their vast distribution demonstrates their ability to inhabit many different environments. They can also adapt to both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Many factors can affect their distribution, such as humidity, oxygen levels, and pH levels. Planctomycetota diversity and abundance are strongly associated with relative humidity. The effects of oxygen levels demonstrate the energy needs of the individual. Many species of Planctomycetota are chemoheterotrophic, including &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot;. &quot;Thermostilla marina&quot;, a thermophilic anaerobic species occupying hydrothermal vent regions, can use elemental sulfur to generate sulfide and respire with nitrate. Planctomycetota can also inhabit regions with ranges in pH levels from 4.2 to 11.6.

=== Ecological impacts and global carbon cycle ===
Planctomycetota have a significant impact on global biogeochemistry and climate, with their ability to mineralize and break down detritus particles in the water column.

Planctomycetota play a considerable role in the global carbon cycle. As both obligate and facultative aerobic chemoheterotrophs, the primary source of carbon used by Planctomycetota is from carbohydrates. Many Planctomycetota have the ability to breakdown extremely complex carbohydrates, making these nutrients available to other organisms. This ability to recycle carbon has been linked to specific C1 metabolism genes observed in many Planctomycetota and are suggested to play a significant role, but this area of research is still poorly understood. 

Planctomycetota also display many sulfatase enzymes, which are capable of breaking down sulfated heteropolysaccharides, which are produced by many groups of macroalgae. The breakdown of these sulfated heteropolysaccharides by Planctomycetota are then used as an energy source. Some Planctomycetota are suggested to be capable of breaking down carrageenan.
=== Association with other organisms ===
Planctomycetota have often been observed in association with many organisms, including, macroalgae, microalgae, marine sponges, and plants such as lichens and bryophytes. They have also been observed inhabiting deep-sea cold seeps, where they are dominant organisms living on tube worms.

=== Macroalgae ===

Planctomycetota are often associated with marine surfaces high in nutrients. They occur as biofilms on algal surfaces in relatively high abundance. Macroalgae such as the kelps &quot;Laminaria hyperborea&quot; and &quot;Ecklonia radiata&quot; are suggested to be an important habitat for Planctomycetota. Roughly 70% of the bacterial community on &quot;Ecklonia radiata&quot; were Planctomycetota. Almost 150 Planctomycetota species have been isolated from the biofilms of macroalgae, and these communities associated with macroalgae are mainly independent of changes in geographical distribution. This would suggest a symbiotic relationship.

Kelp forests dominate the rocky coastlines of temperate regions, and provide habitat, shelter, and food for many organisms, including the Planctomycetota. Given the considerable role of kelp forests in coastal primary productivity, the association of the Planctomycetota with kelp could indicate their significant role in coastal habitats. Planctomycetota also play an important role as components of detritus in the water column, also known as marine snow, given their ability to attach to surfaces.

As the climate continues to warm, the abundance of Planctomycetota associated with macroalgae might increase. The seaweed &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot; was incubated under higher CO2 conditions, and the abundance of Planctomycetota increased substantially, as much as 10 times in some species.

=== Microalgae and diatom blooms ===
While macroalgae are well known substrates for Planctomycetota communities, their abundance has also been known to correlate with blooms of microalgae such as diatoms. Blooms of cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates provide nutrients for Planctomycetota, which could explain the association.

=== Marine sponges ===
Planctomycetota species are often associated with the surfaces of marine sponges. They interact with sponges either by attachment with a holdfast, or through a symbiotic relationship. A high diversity of Planctomycetota is present as biofilms on sponges. The symbiotic relationship among sponges and Planctomycetota contributes to the health of the sponge, and the sponge often provides suitable habitat and nutrients to the Planctomycetota.

=== Lichen communities and sphagnum bogs ===
Planctomycetota were found to be highly abundant in lichen communities throughout northwestern Siberia and displayed extremely high diversity. Planctomycetota have also been associated with lichen communities and &quot;Sphagnum&quot; wetlands. Sphagnum wetlands store large amounts of carbon, contributing to the global carbon cycle. Planctomycetota play a considerable role in the degradation of sphagnum, accounting for roughly 15% of the bacterial community.

=== Other bacterial communities ===
Planctomycetota display associations with other bacterial communities, mainly Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Gemmatimonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota. The growth of many Planctomycetota is often supported by the essential nutrients provided by other bacteria within the community, and some Planctomycetota rely strongly on symbiotic relationships with other bacteria.

== Physiology ==

=== Endocytosis ===
The existence of membrane coat proteins near the intracytoplasmic membrane could be used for an endocytosis-like uptake system, which would be the first instance this function has been found outside of the eukaryotic domain. However, now that the existence of a rigid peptidoglycan cell wall has been confirmed, these vesicles to be able to pass through this cell wall seems unlikely. Additionally, deletion of one of these membrane coat proteins within &quot;P. limnophila&quot; found no decrease in macromolecule uptake. In addition, with the use of cryoelectron tomography-based three-dimensional reconstruction of Planctomycetota has found that what were originally thought to be vesicles being held in the periplasm are actually just folds in the cytoplasmic membrane. Yet it has been demonstrated that the Planctomycetota can survive on high-molecular-weight polysaccharides as their only source of carbon, meaningthey must have the ability to incorporate complex carbon substrates into their cytoplasm. Three hypotheses have been put forth: First, the Planctomycetota excrete an enzyme which, outside of the cell wall, degrades the complex substrates into smaller monosaccharides, which can more easily be transported through the different membranes. Second, the complex substrates become anchored to the outside of Planctomycetota, which are then able to slowly break down these substrates into oligosaccharides, which are able to be transported into the periplasm of Planctomycetota by specialized proteins. The third hypothesis involves the crateriform structures found on the outside of Planctomycetota cell walls. These structures have fibers lining their pits that may be able to absorb whole polysaccharides into the periplasm, where they would then be digested.

=== Osmotic regulation ===

Almost all bacteria have a cytosol following the outer shape of their peptidoglycan cell wall. Eukaryotes are different in that they have their cytosol divided into multiple compartments to create organelles such as a nucleus. Planctomycetota are unique in that they have large invaginations of their cytoplasmic membrane, pulling away from the peptidoglycan cell wall and leaving room for the periplasm. Traditionally, the cytoplasmic membrane has been thought to be responsible for controlling the osmotic pressure of bacterial cells. Yet due to the folds in the cytoplasmic membrane, and the existence of large spaces of periplasm within Planctomycetota, their peptidoglycan acts as an osmotic barrier with the periplasm being isotonic to the cytosol.

=== Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) ===

Anammox is the process of oxidizing ammonium where nitrite acts as the electron acceptor. This process creates energy for the organism performing the reaction in the same way humans gain energy from oxidizing glucose. In a marine environment, this ultimately removes nitrogen from the water, as N2 gas cannot be used by phytoplankton and is released into the atmosphere. Up to 67% of dinitrogen gas production in the ocean can be attributed to anammox and about 50% of the nitrogen gas in the atmosphere is thought to be produced from anammox. Planctomycetota are the most dominant phylum of bacteria capable of performing anammox, thus the Planctomycetota capable of performing anammox play an important role in the global cycling of nitrogen.

=== Sterol synthesis ===
The synthesis of sterols, often observed in eukaryotes and uncommon among bacteria, has been observed very rarely in Planctomycetota. The synthesis of sterols such as lanosterol has been observed in &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot;. Lanosterol is common in eukaryotes and two other groups of bacteria, both methylotrophic Pseudomonadota and myxobacteria. The synthesis of sterols observed in &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot; is unique within Planctomycetota. Sterol synthesis is suggested to be associated with regulation of membrane fluidity in Planctomycetota, and has been described as essential to the proper growth and reproduction of &quot;G. obscuriglobus&quot;.

== Biotechnology and human applications ==
Recently, interest has arisen in examining the Planctomycetota regarding their potential roles in biotechnology, mainly as a source of bioactive molecules, of interest mainly to the pharmaceutical industry. Bioactive compounds are mainly present as secondary metabolites, although little is known about Planctomycetota secondary metabolites. This is unexpected, as the Planctomycetota have several key features as other known producers of bioactive molecules, such as the Myxobacteria. However, a number of ongoing studies serve as various first steps in including Planctomycetota in small-molecule drug development for humans.

Planctomycetota species are worthwhile considerations in challenging the current models for the origin of the nucleus, along with other aspects of origin and evolution of the eukaryotic endomembrane system.

=== Climate change ===
The impacts of research on Planctomycetota and their uses might be of global significance with regards to nutrient cycling processes and assist in furthering understanding for global marine biogeochemistry. However, with Planctomycetota&#x27;s growing influences on metabolic processes involving water and air, it may also have a role in interchanges between oceans and atmosphere, potentially affecting climate change.

=== Planctomycetota as pathogens ===
Planctomycetota species were recently identified as being an opportunistic human pathogen, but a lack of culture media limits studies on the bacteria in the Planctomycetota as pathogens of humans.

<text>Alberto Granado Jiménez (August 8, 1922March 5, 2011) was an Argentine–Cuban biochemist, doctor, author, and scientist. A youthful friend and traveling companion of Che Guevara during their 1952 motorcycle tour in Latin America, Granado later founded the University of Santiago de Cuba School of Medicine. He authored the memoir &quot;Traveling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary&quot;, which served as a reference for the 2004 film &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, in which he was played by Rodrigo de la Serna. An elderly Alberto Granado makes a short appearance at the end of the film.

==Early years==
Granado was born on August 8, 1922, in Hernando, Córdoba to Dionisio T. Granado (a Spanish clerical employee of an Argentine railway company) and Adelina Jiménez Romero. In 1930, after José Félix Uriburu toppled the progressive government of Hipólito Yrigoyen, Granado&#x27;s family relocated to Villa Constitución, province of Santa Fé, due to his father&#x27;s position as a militant trade unionist. In 1931, Granado was sent to live with his grandparents in Córdoba and in 1940, he attended the University of Córdoba, where he studied chemistry, pharmacy and biochemistry.

In his best-selling biography entitled &quot;Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life&quot;, Jon Lee Anderson describes Granado at this time as &quot;barely five feet tall and had a huge beaked nose, but he sported a barrel chest and a footballer&#x27;s sturdy bowed legs; he also possessed a good sense of humor and a taste for wine, girls, literature and rugby.&quot;

In 1943, Granado took part in the political protests against General Juan Perón and was jailed for one year. During this time he came across Ernesto Guevara (who was not yet nicknamed &quot;&quot;Che&quot;&quot;) after Guevara&#x27;s family moved to Córdoba in the hope that the mountain air would ameliorate Ernesto&#x27;s asthma. The two first met when Guevara accompanied Granado&#x27;s brother Tomás (whom he went to school with), on a visit to the police cells to see Granado. Guevara soon joined a rugby team that Granado had organized once released. Although Granado was six years older than Guevara, they shared literary and political interests, combined with a romantic enthusiasm for foreign travel. The two soon became close friends, sharing &quot;an intellectual curiosity, a mischievous sense of humor and a restive desire to explore their continent.&quot; Asked in an interview many years later about his friendship and time on the road with Guevara, Granado reminisced that &quot;we hit it off well, when there was talk about politics, disease and what not, we almost always shared a similar view.&quot;

In 1946, having graduated with an MSc in biochemistry, Granado became a medical assistant to the head of the University of Córdoba&#x27;s Hygiene and Epidemiology department. He had already developed an interest in Hansen&#x27;s bacillus, and so the following year took a post as director of pharmacology in a leprosarium. As a result, from 1947 to 1951, Granado studied at a clinical laboratory and at the San Francisco del Chañar Leprosarium. During this time, Guevara made a point of visiting Granado at San Francisco de Chañar. Granado then won a scholarship to Instituto Malbrán, in Buenos Aires.

==Travels in South America and Europe==



At the age of 29 and with full-time work as a biochemist, Granado sought one final thrill before settling into a life of middle-class comfort. So between December 29, 1951, and July 1952, Granado embarked on a tour of South America on his beloved Norton 500cc motorcycle — &quot;Poderosa II&quot; — with his friend Che Guevara. Both kept diaries on the journey, and would stay at the leprosarium in San Pablo, Peru at trip&#x27;s end. Throughout their continental excursion, they witnessed first hand the poverty of disenfranchised native peoples and their frequent lack of access to otherwise cheap and basic medical care. In particular, the two men were deeply affected in Chile when they visited the American-owned Anaconda Copper&#x27;s Chuquicamata copper mine and met workers toiling for pennies and suffering from silicosis. Granado later lamented that although he and Guevara were impressed by the mine&#x27;s high-tech machinery, &quot;this (was) eclipsed by the indignation aroused when you think that all this wealth only goes to swell the coffers of Yankee capitalism.&quot;

Their encounters with South America&#x27;s &quot;downtrodden and exploited&quot; such as the migrant sheep shearers, copper miners, and Indian peasantry were a key influence on both their lives. For Granado, it confirmed that there was a wider world to see and help than the middle classes of his hometown, while in Guevara it ignited a burning zeal to tackle the cause of such misery, which he came to see as capitalism. These experiences also galvanized both men in realizing their future vocations — Guevara towards Marxist revolutionary politics and Granado to the pursuit of practical science.

Granado&#x27;s journey ended in Caracas, Venezuela, where he remained to work at the Cabo Blanco leprosarium in Maiquetía. Guevara, however, continued on to Miami before returning home to Buenos Aires to complete his medical degree. The two men did not meet again for eight years, by which time Guevara was a hero of Fidel Castro&#x27;s 1959 Cuban Revolution and head of the Central Bank of Cuba.

A few years later in 1955, Granado won a scholarship to the Istituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome; while in Europe he visited France, Spain, and Switzerland. He married Delia María Duque Duque upon his return.

==Career in Cuba==
After the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Granado was invited to Havana by Guevara, who had risen to become second-in-command under Fidel Castro. Thus in 1960, Granado visited Cuba for the first time on Guevara&#x27;s invitation. A year later, he moved there with his family to take up a post as professor of biochemistry at the School of Medicine of the University of Havana. Later that year, he was one of the founders of the Institute for Basic and Pre-Clinical Sciences. In 1962, he founded the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Santiago with a group of colleagues, the second in Cuba. He would serve as a senior professor there until 1974. Granado was thus in part responsible for Cuba&#x27;s high number of highly trained doctors, which has been described as &quot;one of the undeniable achievements of Castro&#x27;s government&quot;.

Between 1975 and 1986, Granado obtained his doctorate in biological sciences and attended the World Congress on Genetics in Moscow. He also attended the Congress on Polymorphism in Leningrad and became centrally involved in the development of Holstein Tropical cattle breeds. In 1978, he published his account of his and Guevara&#x27;s 1951–1952 tour of South America, named &quot;Con el Che por Sudamerica&quot;, in Spanish, Italian, and French.

Between 1986 and 1990, he took part in the creation of the Cuban Genetics Society and was appointed its president.

Between 1991 and 1994, he devoted his time to validation and methodology of his previous research in universities in Venezuela and Spain before his retirement in 1994. In 1997, he joined the campaign for solidarity with Cuba and promotion of Guevara&#x27;s ideas at home and abroad.

Between 2002 and 2003, he was an on-set advisor to Walter Salles&#x27; film &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, based upon Granado&#x27;s &quot;Con el Che por Sudamerica&quot; and Guevara&#x27;s own account &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot;, published posthumously in 1967. Granado made a cameo appearance as himself in the epilogue of the film. The first English-language edition of Granado&#x27;s account was published in 2003, entitled &quot;Travelling with Che Guevara: The Making of a Revolutionary.&quot;

==On Che==

In her film &quot;My Best Friend&quot;, producer Clare Lewins asks Granado what he believes to be the reason for Che Guevara&#x27;s continuing attraction, his response was:

Before Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to pursue revolutions abroad, he left several books with inscriptions for close friends. Included with these was one book about the sugar industry for his old friend Granado. The message, which two years later after Che&#x27;s execution in Bolivia would seem prescient, read: &quot;My dreams shall know no bounds, at least until bullets decide otherwise. I&#x27;ll be expecting you, sedentary gypsy, when the smell of gunpowder subsides. A hug for all of you, Che.&quot;

===Che Trusted Me (book)===
In February 2010, it was announced that a new Spanish language book entitled &quot;El Che Confía En Mí&quot; (Che Trusted Me) would be launched by the Abril publishing house. The book, written by Rosa María Fernández Sofía, is based on a series of interviews conducted with Granado. According to the author:

==Death==
Granado died of natural causes on March 5, 2011, at the age of 88. According to Cuban television, Granado requested that his body be cremated and his ashes spread in Cuba, Argentina and Venezuela.

His death coincidentally occurred on the 51st anniversary of when Che&#x27;s famous &quot;Guerrillero Heroico&quot; photograph was taken by Alberto Korda.

==Family==
With his Venezuela-born wife Delia Maria Duque Duque (married in 1955), he had three children (Alberto, Delita and Roxana). One of his sons, also named Alberto Granado, is head of Cuba&#x27;s Africa House, a center in Havana that celebrates African culture.

==Filmography and popular culture==
Granado was featured in the 2006 documentary film &quot;&quot;. He is portrayed by Rodrigo de la Serna in the 2004 film &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; based on his and Guevara&#x27;s trip around South America. Granado has a brief cameo following the epilogue of the film.

<text>Clockwork Knight is a side-scrolling platform video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Saturn. It was released in Japan on December 9, 1994, and as a launch title in North America and Europe, on May 11 and July 8, 1995, respectively. It was followed by &quot;Clockwork Knight 2&quot;.

On December 15, 1995, Clockwork Knight: Pepperouchau no Fukubukuro, a compilation featuring both &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot; titles and additional content was released in Japan. This version was used as the basis for the American release of &quot;Clockwork Knight 2&quot;, which was released on February 17, 1996, although with the first game locked behind a cheat code. Reviews were mixed, with critics praising the advanced graphics but criticizing the low difficulty, short length, and lack of gameplay innovation.

==Plot==
Sir Tongara de Pepperouchau III (&quot;Pepper&quot; for short) is a toy soldier. He is in love with the Clockwork Fairy Princess, Chelsea, whose voice wakes up the toys of the house every night at midnight. But he is clumsy and something of a laughing stock, especially when compared to his friendly rival Ginger who is also after Chelsea&#x27;s heart.

One night Chelsea is stolen away by an unknown force, which also hypnotizes some of the lesser toys to become fierce minions and stand in the way of anyone who would try to rescue her. If there is no voice to wake them up anymore then the toys will never live again, so Pepper and Ginger head off to find Chelsea before it is too late.

==Gameplay==
This game is a side-scrolling platformer in the vein of the &quot;Mario&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Unlike those games, however, the game uses prerendered digitized 2D sprites of high-resolution 3D models similar to the &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; series, or &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, on top of fully 3D levels (and with fully 3D bosses).

Pepper attacks enemies and opens passages with his key. A quick tap of a button will thrust it out horizontally. Likewise, repeatedly tapping the button over and over will cause him to twist the key around and around. This makes it a bit more powerful (e.g.: an enemy could be knocked out temporarily with a simple jab, but running into the key when twisting it will instantly take it out). He can also pick up unconscious enemies or objects such as footballs or springs and toss them; vertical tosses are possible.

The goal is to reach the end of the stage before time or hit points (typically three, though Gold Keys can increase that maximum) run out. There are no checkpoints; dying sends a player back to the beginning of a level. The levels are fairly large and contain numerous side areas with treasures. Every third level, Pepper must face off against a large, fully polygonal boss in a one-on-one battle. The game has 13 levels, including boss levels. The levels take place in four different rooms (Betsy&#x27;s Room, Kevin&#x27;s Room, the Kitchen, and the Attic) with two normal levels and one boss each, plus a final boss. After beating the bosses of the first three worlds, the player can opt to participate in a bonus game called Soltian Roulette, ran by Soltia the perfume bottle in which Imperial Crowns (silver coins found commonly throughout the game) are spent for a chance at gaining extra lives in a shell game. If Pepper loses all his lives, the player can continue from the beginning of the current room by spending Crowns. If the player does not have enough coins to continue, the game is over and the player must start from the beginning of the game. 

==Development==
According to producer Noriyoshi Oba, &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot; took over a year to create. Before deciding on a world of toys, the development team thought of utilizing a much darker and serious swords and sorcery theme, but after many revisions it was dropped due to it being deemed unsatisfactory. After the switch to the fantasy toy setting, development sped up considerably. Designer Katsuhisa &quot;Kats&quot; Sato cited &quot;Mickey Mania&quot; as an influence on &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot;. The game&#x27;s full motion video sequences were designed by freelance artist Masayuki Hasegawa.

Sega made several modifications to make the game more difficult for its North American and European releases, such as increasing the number of hits required to defeat the bosses, as well as increasing the number of Imperial Crowns needed to play the Soltian Roulette bonus game. Producer Dante Anderson explained, &quot;For some reason, Japanese audiences like to beat their games very quickly, but Americans want more challenge, and Europeans like the games tougher still.&quot; Further alterations were also made, such as removing before-level cutscenes (in which Pepper would receive advice from his various friends and family) and changing the skin tone of the game&#x27;s first boss, a top hot-toting doll named Dandy Bob, to blue due to the belief the fight would resemble a toy attacking a human child.

== Reception ==

On release, &quot;Sega Saturn Tsūshin&quot; awarded the game a 29 out of 40. &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; followed this up with a score of 32 out of 40 eight months later, giving it a 10 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review.

USA-based magazine &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewed the Japanese version of the game prior to the Saturn&#x27;s launch in the USA. They highly praised the responsive controls and graphical effects such as the scaling of enemies when they move to and from the background, but criticized the game for lack of gameplay innovation, concluding that it is &quot;excellent-looking&quot; and &quot;enjoyable to play&quot; but &quot;once the initial look of the game wears off, you&#x27;re left with a game you&#x27;ve been playing for years.&quot; Their later review of the North American release was more forgiving. Though they criticized the music, controls, and low difficulty, they acknowledged that the game was a strong showcase of the Saturn&#x27;s graphical features and concluded that younger gamers might enjoy it. &quot;Next Generation&quot; also reviewed the game prior to the Saturn&#x27;s USA launch. They too were highly impressed with the game&#x27;s graphics, noting particularly the &quot;solidity&quot; and depth of the objects, the exceptional parallax scrolling effects, and the textures of the scenery. However, they also concurred that the gameplay is &quot;routine&quot; and unoriginal platforming, and found the game too easy as well.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; agreed that the game was a showcase for the Saturn&#x27;s graphical abilities but considered this to be a negative, with one of them elaborating that &quot;The 3-D perspective is practically shoved down your throat. There are enough colors to blind you for life...&quot; Two of them felt the graphics were particularly wasted because the player character cannot enter the different scrolling planes. They rated it an overall &quot;good game&quot; and scored it 28 out of 40 (7 out of 10 average). Similarly to &quot;GamePro&quot; and &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Maximum&quot; commented that &quot;The graphics do look great … and the gameplay is decent enough, but playing the game is in no way a new experience. Everything you can do in &quot;Clockwork Knight&quot;, you&#x27;ve probably done before in a 16-bit title.&quot; However, they felt the game&#x27;s worst point to be its lack of longevity, asserting that &quot;even the most unskilled player will have seen all four levels in one session.&quot;

<text>Ratlam is a city in the northwestern part of the Malwa region in Madhya Pradesh state of India. The city of Ratlam lies above sea level. It is the administrative headquarters of Ratlam district, which was created in 1947 after the independence of India. It is located 294 kilometres west of the state capital Bhopal.

Ratlam railway division is one of the six railway divisions under Western Railway zone of Indian Railways. Whose headquarters is in Ratlam city. This is an important railway junction of the state.

==History==
According to the local legend, Ratlam got its name from the name of the local Bhil king Ratna Bhil. According to the Rajasthan Jatiyon Ki Khoj book, the last Bhil king of Ratlam was Jassa Bhil. After him, Ratan Singh captured Ratlam with the help of the Mughals, Since the relations between the Rajputs of Ratlam and the Mughals were good from the beginning, the Mughals used to come to Ratlam. In the eighteenth century, the Bhils again established their rule in Ratlam. During that time, a Mughal chief came to Ratlam , then the Bhil chief fed him Bhildi sev, this Bhildi sev is today world famous as Ratlami Sev.

Ratlam State was founded in 1652 by a great-grandson of Raja Udai Singh of Jodhpur, namely Raja Ratan Singh Rathore, son of Mahesh Das of Jalore. The latter, father, and son, had performed important military services for the Emperor Shah Jahan by defeating the Persians and Uzbeks in Afghanistan. In reward for their services and in recognition of their great deeds of valour, large territories in the south-western districts of Rajputana and northern Malwa were conferred on them. Their capital became Ratram (named after Raja Ratan Singh and his first son Ram Singh) which later got translated to Ratlam.

Maharaja Ratan Singh Rathore 1652/1658, courageous in youth, he gained Shah Jahan&#x27;s notice by calming the Emperors favourite elephant which had run amok in the Agra Palace Garden, fought for the Emperor against the Persians in Kabul and Qandahar, later in 1652, the Emperor substituted Jalore for the pargana of Ratlam and many other areas, and he became the first Raja of Ratlam his advisor was jasraj bahratt and chief commander was Parshurama ojha of Shrimali Brahmins. In 1658 a false rumour of the death of the Emperor resulted in a frenzied scramble for succession to the throne amongst his sons. Dara Shikoh who was officiating for his father, sent a combined army of Rajputs and Muslims under the command of Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur, against his brother Aurangzeb. The Maharaja, as head of the Rathore clan, was persuaded to hand over command of the Imperial army to Maharaja Ratan Singh. Non-co-operation by the Muslim commanders resulted in the army sustaining heavy losses in the fierce battle at Dharmat, as well as the death of Ratan Singh (said to have sustained 80 sword wounds on his body).

Ratan Singh had married (among others), Maharani Sukhroopde Kanwar Shekhawat Ji Sahiba, daughter of Kunwar Purshottam Das of Jhajhar [Shekhawati], and had an issue. He died in 1658 in battle at Dharmat near Ujjain.

Before the opening of the Rajputana State Railway to Khandwa in 1872, there was no better place to trade than in Ratlam.

The city is known for its love of food, its taste particularly the world popular salty snack &#x27;Ratlami Sev&#x27;. The purity of Gold Jewellery and Saree Market of Ratlam outshines in India.

Ratlam was part of the Malwa Agency of Central India during the British Raj. The state&#x27;s capital was Ratlam town in modern Ratlam district of Madhya Pradesh. Ratlam was originally a huge state, but the then ruler Ratan Singh opposed Aurangzeb in the Battle of Dharmatpur and was killed after a brave fight. The state was then reduced and the title of Maharaja has eventually stripped away; the title was later restored by the British during Maharaja Sajjan Singh&#x27;s rule. On 5 January 1819 Ratlam State became a British protectorate.

<text>Győr county (in Hungarian: &quot;Győr (vár)megye&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, situated mostly on the right (south) side of the Danube river. Its territory is now part of Hungary, except seven villages on the left side of the Danube which belong to Slovakia. The capital of the county was the city of Győr.

==Geography==
Győr county shared borders with the counties Moson, Pozsony, Komárom, Veszprém and Sopron. The rivers Danube, and Rába run through the county. Its area was 1534 km2 around 1910.

==History==
The Győr comitatus arose as one of the first comitatus of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its southern part was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1543. The Ottoman Empire meant a constant threat to the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary therefore the Habsburg kings divided the kingdom&#x27;s remaining territory into captaincies. The Captaincy of Győr was located between lake Balaton and river Danube. In 1594, the Ottomans captured the city Győr, however an Habsburg-Hungarian army reconquered it in 1598. The other parts of Győr County were liberated from Ottoman rule in the 1680s.

In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon assigned a very small part of the territory of the county to Czechoslovakia. The rest stayed in Hungary and merged with the eastern part of Moson county and a very small part of Pozsony county to form Győr-Moson-Pozsony county in 1923.

The county became abolished after World War II and Győr-Moson county was created instead. In 1950, Sopron county merged with Győr-Moson county to form Győr-Sopron county. This county was renamed to Győr-Moson-Sopron in 1990. The part of the county north of the river Danube is now in Slovakia, Trnava Region.

<doc id="954797" wikidata="Q822437" url="?curid=954797" title="Bernard Gert">
<text>Bernard Gert (; October 16, 1934 – December 24, 2011) was a moral philosopher known primarily for his work in normative ethics, as well as in medical ethics, especially pertaining to psychology.

His work has been called &quot;among the clearest and most comprehensive on the contemporary scene&quot;, &quot;far more detailed and more concretely worked out&quot; and &quot;systematic&quot; than competing comprehensive ethical theories. Because it avoids pitfalls associated with other dominant ethical theoretical approaches (such as deontology, utilitarianism, contractarianism, and virtue ethics), Gert&#x27;s moral theory &quot;provides what many people are looking for&quot;.

==Life==
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Gert studied philosophy at Cornell University. He was a professor at Dartmouth College for fifty years, from 1959 to 2009. At the time of his death in 2011, he was the Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, emeritus at Dartmouth. He also had other adjunct and visiting appointments, including the University of Edinburgh 1974-5 and being a fellow of the Hastings Center, an independent bioethics research institution. He died in 2011 in North Carolina.

A source of notoriety among his contemporaries was that his family became a family of philosophers: his two children, Joshua and Heather, both became philosophers, and both married two other philosophers.

==Metaethics==

===Definition of morality===
Gert advocates the following definition of morality:
: Morality is an informal public system applying to all rational persons, governing behavior that affects others, and includes what are commonly known as the moral rules, ideals, and virtues and has the lessening of evil or harm as its goal.

===Morality as known to all===
According to Gert, his theory counts as a natural law theory because he holds that all moral agents must be able to understand morality in order to count as moral agents. In other words, &quot;moral judgments can only be made about those who know what kind of behavior morality prohibits, requires, discourages, encourages, and allows.&quot;

===Harm as the central moral concept===
According to Gert, harm (or &quot;evil&quot;) is the central moral concept. Gert believes harm is what all rational creatures seek to avoid. He advances the following five-concept account of harm:
* death
* pain
* disability
* loss of freedom
* loss of pleasure.
He maintains that commonsense morality is far more concerned with prohibiting (and discouraging) evil than with requiring (or encouraging) people to enhance goods or benefits.

===Rationality and impartiality===
On Gert&#x27;s view, the bases for morality are rationality and impartiality.

On Gert&#x27;s conception of rationality, it is irrational to fail to be averse to harm. Everyone avoids harm insofar as they are rational. Rationality does require that we avoid harming ourselves without an adequate reason. A rational person would not cause his own pain unless it were for an adequate reason, for example, to cure a disease. Even a masochist causes pain in himself for a reason, presumably for pleasure. This helps show that no rational being seeks to harm himself for its own sake.

The sort of &quot;adequate reason&quot; in question involves avoiding any of the five basic evils or obtaining of any of the following &quot;basic goods&quot;:
* pleasure
* freedom
* ability
* consciousness

According to Gert, acting rationally does not always require acting morally. For example, it is not irrational to set a trap for someone who is wearing an Armani suit so that they fall into a swimming pool in front of a video camera, since the pleasure one can get out of watching the video constitutes an adequate reason for harming the other person. It would also be rational for a sadist to torture other people for fun provided the sadist could get away with it.

There are five sorts of irrational desire according to Gert: seeking death, pain, disability, loss of freedom, or loss of pleasure. We arrive at moral rules by extending these objects of irrational desire to others. Rationality, alone, does not require this. However, if we adopt the principle of impartiality, whereby we apply the rules without regard to who gains or loses, we extend these prohibitions to others. This results in rules such as &quot;do not kill&quot;, &quot;do not cause pain&quot;, &quot;do not disable&quot;, and so forth.

===Why be moral?===
On Gert&#x27;s view, there are several reasons to act morally. The primary one is i) that if you don&#x27;t, someone else will be harmed. While it is rational not to care about others, the fact that they will be harmed is enough of a reason itself.

Other reasons to act morally include ii) that acting immorally will corrupt one&#x27;s own character, and iii) that some forms of immoral action can make the world inhospitable to oneself, such that in some cases it is irrational to act immorally toward others.

==Normative ethics==

===Ten moral rules===
In his book &quot;Common Morality: Deciding What to Do&quot;, Gert proposes ten moral rules which, if followed, create a moral system. The rules are as follows:

# Do not kill
# Do not cause pain
# Do not disable
# Do not deprive of freedom
# Do not deprive of pleasure
# Do not deceive
# Keep your promises
# Do not cheat
# Obey the law
# Do your duty

The first five of these rules directly prohibit harming other people. Thus, they can be summarized with the slogan, &#x27;do not harm&#x27;. The second five rules get their force from the fact that if it were generally allowed that those rules be broken, many harms (and losses of benefits) would result. They can be summarized with the slogan, &#x27;do not violate trust&#x27;.

===Exceptions to the rules: the two-step procedure===
Gert holds that the moral rules are not absolute, but admit of exceptions. To determine whether a moral rule applies in a certain case or whether there is an exception, Gert advises people to follow what he calls the &quot;two step procedure.&quot; The first step is to ascertain all morally relevant information about the scenario at hand in order to make a justified evaluation. The second step is to consider the consequences of other people knowing that they can violate the moral rule in similar circumstances.

An example of this would be if you were to consider violating rule #9 (breaking the law) in order to run a red light. You evaluate the scenario and notice that there are no cars around and running the red light will not cause any harm, however, you do not want other people to know that they can run red lights too, because that would lead to more car accidents, which is indirectly causing pain and death. Another example of violating the moral rules would be killing in self-defense. If you evaluate the situation, you find that if you do not kill the other person, they will violate one of the moral rules and kill you. Also, it would be acceptable in this scenario for other people to know that killing in self-defense is allowable.

===Moral ideals===
&quot;Moral ideals&quot;, according to Gert, are objectives to lessen the amount of harm or evil in the world. These differ from moral rules, which are requirements that people avoid performing certain kinds of actions which produce harms to others. Morality encourages, but does not require, people to live up to moral ideals. Examples of moral ideals are the objectives of reducing the incidence of domestic violence or of breast cancer.

What Gert calls &quot;utilitarian ideals&quot; are objectives to increase the amount of good in the world. For example, the objective of giving poor children extra presents for Christmas.

==Categorizing Gert&#x27;s moral theory==
Although his moral system shares similarities to deontology, rule utilitarianism, and contractarianism, Gert does not ally himself with any of those positions. He writes, &quot;I think that my view is best characterized as a natural law theory . . . in the tradition of Hobbes&quot;. He also writes, &quot;my view has been characterized as Kant with consequences, as Mill with publicity, and as Ross with a theory.&quot;

However, when Walter Sinnott-Armstrong once labeled the theory as &quot;a sophisticated form of negative objective universal public rule consequentialism&quot;, Gert replied that &quot;there may be no point in denying that I am some form of consequentialist&quot;.

<doc id="954798" wikidata="Q236933" url="?curid=954798" title="Joanna II of Naples">
<text>Joanna II (25 June 1371 – 2 February 1435) was Queen of Naples from 1414 to her death in 1435, when the Capetian House of Anjou became extinct. As a mere formality, she used the title of Queen of Jerusalem, Sicily, and Hungary.

==Early life==
Joanna was born at Zara (present-day Zadar, Croatia), on 25 June 1371, as the daughter of Charles III of Naples and Margaret of Durazzo.

After 1386 Marie of Blois Duchess Dowager of Anjou started negotiations about her son Louis II of Anjou&#x27;s marriage with Joanna, but Louis flatly refused to marry the daughter of his father&#x27;s principal enemy in May 1387. Joanna married her first husband, William, Duke of Austria, in Vienna in the autumn of 1401 when she was 28 years of age. He had been rejected as a husband by her cousin, Queen Hedwig of Poland. Joanna did not have any children by William, who died in 1406 after five years of marriage. After his death she acquired a lover by the name of , called &quot;Alopo&quot; [bald], whom she appointed Grand Chamberlain. Alopo was the first in what would become a series of lovers and male favourites. He later caused the downfall of the influential condottiero and grand constable Muzio Sforza, provoking much jealousy.

==Accession==
In 1414, the 41-year-old and childless Joanna succeeded her brother Ladislaus on the throne of Naples. In early 1415, she became engaged to John, a son of King Ferdinand I of Aragon and twenty-five years her junior. The betrothal was annulled shortly after, which left Joanna free to choose another husband. On 10 August 1415, she married a second time, to James II, Count of La Marche, in order to gain the support of the French monarchy. The marriage contract stipulated that upon his marriage to Joanna, James would be granted the title of Prince of Taranto. Not having received the promised title, he had Alopo killed and forced Joanna to name him King of Naples. In an attempt to assume complete power, James imprisoned Joanna in her own apartments in the royal palace; however, she was later released by the nobles.

In 1416, a riot exploded in Naples, and James was compelled to send back his French administrators and to renounce his title. In this period, Joanna began her relationship with Sergianni Caracciolo, who later acquired an overwhelming degree of power over the court. On 28 August 1417, she reconquered Rome, and the following year James left Naples for France.

==Rupture with the papacy==

With James now powerless, Joanna could finally celebrate her coronation on 28 October 1419, when she was crowned Queen of Sicily and Naples. However, her relationship with Naples&#x27; nominal feudal suzerain, Pope Martin V, soon worsened. Upon the advice of Caracciolo, she denied Martin economic aid to rebuild the papal army. In response, the Pope called in Louis III of Anjou, son of the rival of King Ladislaus and himself still a pretender to the Neapolitan throne. In 1420, Louis invaded Campania, but the Pope, trying to gain personal advantage from the menace posed to Joanna, called the ambassadors of the two parties to Florence.

Joanna rejected the ambiguous papal proposal calling for help from the brother of her erstwhile betrothed, the powerful King Alfonso V of Aragon, to whom she promised the hereditary title to Naples. Alfonso entered Naples in July 1421. Louis lost the support of the Pope, but at the same time the relationship between Joanna and Alfonso worsened. In May 1423, Alfonso had Caracciolo arrested and besieged Joanna&#x27;s residence, the Castel Capuano. An agreement was obtained; Caracciolo was freed, and fled to Aversa with Joanna. Here she met again with Louis, declared her adoption of Alfonso to be null and void, and named Louis as her new heir. Alfonso was forced to return to Spain, so that she could be returned to Naples in April 1424. Caracciolo&#x27;s exceeding ambition pushed Joanna to plot his assassination in 1432. On 19 August 1432, Sergianni Caracciolo was stabbed in his room in Castel Capuano. He was buried in Naples in the church of San Giovanni a Carbonara.

==Years of peace==
The remaining years of Joanna&#x27;s reign were relatively peaceful. Louis dwelled in his fiefdom, the Duchy of Calabria, waiting for the call to the throne, but died in 1434. The aging Joanna named René, Louis&#x27; brother, as her heir. She died in Naples on 2 February 1435 at the age of 63, and was buried in the Church of Santa Annunziata. With her death the entire Capetian House of Anjou became extinct.

<text>Dominick Martin, better known by his stage name Calibre, is a Northern Irish drum and bass music producer and DJ from Belfast. He is highly regarded for his influence on the liquid funk style of drum and bass, which was partially named after his distinct production style. He primarily releases his own works through his personal label, Signature Recordings, but has also released on labels such as Hospital Records, V Recordings, Creative Source and Soul:R.

Many of his productions–some of which were unreleased at the time–became synonymous with liquid funk due to DJ Fabio playing most of Martin&#x27;s productions on his BBC Radio 1 show, &quot;Liquid Funk&quot;, and at &quot;Swerve&quot; club nights (originally known as &quot;Speed&quot;, which was co-ran with LTJ Bukem) in the early 2000s. Beginning in 2007, some of these unreleased productions would be released under the &quot;Shelflife&quot; series of albums alongside other works by Martin on his personal record label, Signature Records.

According to UKF, none of Martin&#x27;s productions have been officially remixed by other artists.

In 2019, Martin was awarded &quot;Critics Choice&quot; in the Drum&amp;BassArena Awards 2019.

== Career ==

Martin started producing drum and bass in 1995, after being inspired by artists such as Goldie and LTJ Bukem. His first single was released in 1998 under the now-defunct Quadraphonic record label, which was closely associated with U2&#x27;s &quot;The Kitchen&quot; nightclub located under The Clarence Hotel. During this time, he gave a tape demo to LTJ Bukem, who never sought an official release after reaching back out to Martin.

Through Quadraphonic, he came to the attention of drum and bass DJ Fabio, who signed Martin to his record label, Creative Source, and later released his debut album &quot;Musique Concrète&quot; in 2001, named after the musique concrète compositions of John Cage, who he was influenced by while attending the University of Ulster in Belfast. Although 21 songs were chosen for the final release of the album, 300 songs in total were created by Martin.

In 2003, Martin was commissioned by Warner Music Group for a remix of &quot;Put That Woman First&quot; from Jaheim&#x27;s &quot;Still Ghetto&quot; album (2002). Despite Jaheim&#x27;s disapproval of the remix, 1,000 limited-edition white label vinyl records were pressed with permission from Warner due to the underground popularity garnered by the remix. In 2023, the remix was included on a compilation album for purchase on digital storefronts.

In 2005, he released &quot;Second Sun&quot;, which is considered to be Martin&#x27;s best album according to &quot;Beat&quot;.
In 2019, a remix by Martin was included in an extended play of &quot;Swan Song&quot; by Dua Lipa.

<text>The Crest Theatre is a historic theatre located in downtown Sacramento, California.

==History==
It originally opened in 1912 as the Empress Theatre, and at that time was used as a vaudeville palace. It later became the Hippodrome. On September 14, 1946 the Hippodrome&#x27;s marquee suddenly fell to the pavement below, killing a bystander, Mrs. Jessie Shirley Potter, 41, of Alta, who was crushed beneath the marquee. Joseph Brady, 40, was struck a glancing blow and sustained a skull fracture, broken collarbone, permanent brain injury and loss of hearing in one ear. Damages of $176,334.50 were sought by Potter&#x27;s family and by Brady in superior court.

Shortly after the tragedy, in 1949, the building was completely remodeled and revamped to its current form as the Crest Theatre. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was one of the premier first-run movie palaces in the Sacramento area. As the decade turned to the 1970s, it was reduced to mostly sub-run fare. In the early 1980s, the Crest closed down for a time while several attempts were made to revive the theatre in many forms, including a dinner theatre. Finally, by the end of 1995, the Crest was completely refurbished and today its main auditorium (which has been left in its post-1946 unaltered state) is a multi-purpose theatre showing classic revival and specialty films, occasional live shows and lectures. Two additional, smaller cinemas were built adjacent to the original site around the time of the remodeling. The two subterranean theaters were closed in the 2010s and replaced by Empress Tavern in 2015.

== Events at theatre ==
=== The Trash Film Orgy ===
The Trash Film Orgy is an annual event extending through six weeks in the summer, with occasional Halloween and Christmas shows. It features cult cinema, live stage shows, live bands, local films, carnival-type games, a lounge, and audience participation. Live guests are occasionally featured and have included filmmaker Ray Dennis Steckler, actor Sid Haig and others. The current ownership has stopped hosting this event.

=== Sacramento French Film Festival ===
The Sacramento French Film Festival, founded in 2001, is an annual event held in July at the Crest Theatre. It celebrates the present as well as the rich history of French cinema featuring new releases and rarely seen classics. It is the only festival dedicated to French cinema in Northern California and one of only two on the West coast.

=== Sacramento Jewish Film Festival ===
This is a film festival that takes place annually at the Crest. It is now in its 10th year. The two co founders are Margi Park-Landau and Sid Heberger, the manager of the Crest. Park-Landau wanted to create a place closer to Sacramento where Jewish films could be shown. All the films shown at the film festival relate to the Jewish experience in one way or another. Guest speakers, live music, and a nosh are all part of this two-day event.

=== Sacramento Film and Music Festival ===
The Sacramento Film and Music Festival is an international submission-based film festival combined with local programs for both filmmakers and musicians. In 2008, the festival expanded to ten days with all programs hosted at the Crest Theatre. For its 12th year, in 2011, the festival has divided into two seasonal events: WinterFEST in January and SummerFEST in August, with both events continuing to include all genres and lengths of film.

J Street Film Festival

==Concerts==
Crest Theatre has hosted numerous concerts with bands such as Cyndi Lauper, Dinosaur Jr., Guns n Roses Nirvana, Sonic Youth, The Smashing Pumpkins, Shawn Mendes, Pixies and Slayer.

<text>The Lincoln Navigator is a full-size luxury SUV marketed and sold by the Lincoln Motor Company brand of Ford Motor Company since the 1998 model year. Sold primarily in North America, the Navigator is the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Expedition. It is the heaviest production Lincoln ever built, and is also the Lincoln with the greatest cargo capacity and the first non-limousine Lincoln to offer seating for more than six people.

Lincoln Navigator production was sourced from 1997 to 2009 at the Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan. Since 2009, production has also been sourced from the Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville, Kentucky.

== Background ==
At the end of the 1980s, in the United States, sport-utility vehicles gradually began to transition from dedicated off-road vehicles towards dedicated family vehicles, similar to station wagons. In 1991, the Jeep Grand Wagoneer (SJ) ended its almost unchanged 28-year production run. The vehicle had gained a famous reputation for its high content, featuring the same content as a luxury sedan. A smaller, unibody Grand Cherokee (ZJ) was induced during 1992 that offered new luxury equipment and class-exclusive features. General Motors introduced the Oldsmobile Bravada in 1990 and Ford later introduced the Mercury Mountaineer in 1996, convincing several other manufacturers to introduce mid-size luxury SUVs. As full-size SUVs such as the Chevrolet Suburban and Ford Expedition are highly profitable vehicles, the Lincoln Navigator was positioned by Ford as a full-sized, luxury SUV.
==First generation (1998–2002)==
The Lincoln Navigator was launched on July 1, 1997, for the 1998 model year, with the first vehicle rolling off the assembly line on May 14, 1997. Based directly on the Ford Expedition, introduced the year before, the Navigator gave the Lincoln-Mercury division its first full-size SUV (slotted above the Ford Explorer-based Mercury Mountaineer).

In its first calendar year of sales (i.e. 1998), Navigator contributed to an unprecedented event of recent decades – with Lincoln overtaking perennial rival Cadillac in annual sales volume. Initially, published figures indicated that Cadillac had outsold Lincoln by a scant 222 vehicles sold, thanks to an enormous surge in Cadillac Escalade sales in December 1998, from hundreds in previous months to almost 5,000. A subsequent audit resulted in a retraction/apology in May 1999, attributing the &quot;error&quot; to &quot;overzealous&quot; &quot;low-level&quot; employees.

=== Chassis ===
The Lincoln Navigator was also developed under the Ford program code name UN173, with the Expedition developed under the UN93 program code name. A full-size body-on-frame vehicle, the Navigator was mechanically related to the Ford Expedition; both vehicles were related to the 1997 Ford F-Series. The Navigator featured independent front suspension (short-long arm/SLA); the rear suspension was of a live rear axle design. Using an optional feature from its Ford counterpart, the Navigator was designed with load-leveling air suspension; tuned primarily for ride comfort, the air suspension lowered itself when the vehicle was parked.

Although technically available with rear-wheel drive, the primary drivetrain on the Lincoln Navigator was ControlTrac, a computer-controlled automatic four-wheel drive system. As with the Expedition, the Navigator was fitted with four-wheel anti-lock disc brakes.

Using the same 230 hp 5.4L Triton V8 as the Expedition/F-150 paired with the 4-speed 4R100 automatic transmission, the 1998 Lincoln Navigator came with a towing capacity of . During 1999, Lincoln would fit two different engines in the Navigator in an effort to better match full-size SUVs from General Motors. At the beginning of the model year, the Triton V8 was upgraded to 260 hp; as a running change during the model year, Lincoln would replace the SOHC Triton with a 300 hp DOHC 5.4L V8, named InTech (borrowing a name from the Mark VIII). Due to the increase in power, towing capacity would increase to over .

=== Body ===
Although the Lincoln Navigator shares the same bodyshell as the Ford Expedition, giving it a similar exterior appearance, Lincoln stylists would make many design changes to differentiate the two vehicles. Forward of the windshield, the Lincoln Navigator shares no body panels with its Ford counterpart, with its own front fascia (a grille design shared with the 1998 Lincoln Town Car and the 2000 Lincoln LS), wheels, roof rack, lower body trim, and taillights. The interior of the two vehicles shared more commonality, with the dashboard common to both vehicles (with greater use of wood trim); the Navigator was given its own seat design. To make for a quieter interior over the Expedition and Ford F-Series, the Navigator made greater use of sound deadening materials and higher-quality carpeting.

The Lincoln Navigator included standard features available or optional on the Expedition, including power driver and passenger bucket seats, 2nd-row bucket seats (with a 2nd-row bench seat as a delete option), floor consoles, and keyless entry. The few options available included a power moonroof, a universal garage door opener, 7 seven to 8 eight passenger seating an electrochromic rearview mirror (filtering out headlight glare from vehicles seen in the mirror), and a premium audio system (a seven speaker, 290-Watt audio system with a 6-disc front console-mounted CD-changer, and rear seat audio controls), and 17-inch alloy wheels.

Some of the unique features on the first-generation Navigator were power-adjustable pedals (a first-of-its-kind feature on a luxury SUV), a feature on the factory radio that only illuminated the controls necessary for the selected function, full controls for the audio system, climate controls, and cruise controls on the front of the steering wheel, and rear seat radio and climate controls.

During its production run, Lincoln made few changes to the first-generation Navigator. In 1999, alongside the addition of the InTech V8, power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were added; the previously optional 17-inch wheels became standard.

For 2000, the fender-mounted radio antenna was integrated into the right-rear window, while the interior received &quot;Nudo&quot; leather seating surfaces. The carpeting and netting on the rear of the two front seats were replaced with leather and buttoned map pockets respectively, and the recessed tray on the rear center console&#x27;s lid for those Navigators that had rear captain&#x27;s chairs instead of bench seats was replaced with a flat leather lid. The options list expanded to include a satellite navigation system, heated and cooled front seats, a reverse-sensing system, and side-impact airbags.

For 2001, several minor cosmetic changes were made. On the hood&#x27;s grille and tailgate, the Lincoln emblem was given a black background (replacing the previous red); on the tailgate, the Lincoln and Navigator badging switched sides. A VHS-based video entertainment system became an option.

For 2002, heated and cooled front seats were available, and the outlined Lincoln emblem embossed on the center of the steering wheel was replaced with a molded Lincoln badge.

==Second generation (2003–2006)==

Launched in May 2002 for 2003, a number of changes and improvements were made to the Navigator thanks to a thorough redesign. The Navigator continued to share a platform with the Ford Expedition, which was also redesigned for 2003, but continued to differ from it in terms of styling and various upscale features. The redesign featured a thoroughly revised exterior, the first since the Navigator&#x27;s launch, with only the front doors and roof panel unchanged from the previous generation. The new exterior came with things such as a larger chrome waterfall grille, brighter quad-beam headlights with larger housings, revised chrome door handles set in color-keyed bezels, and slightly wider running boards. Inside the Navigator was an all-new instrument panel and dashboard area which, significantly, was not shared with the Expedition. Inspired by the symmetrical, &quot;dual-cockpit&quot; layout of the 1961 Lincoln Continental, the instrument panel and dashboard area was adorned with real walnut burl wood inserts and panels and switches painted with a low-luster satin nickel color. Adding to the upscale interior design further were white LEDs, 120 in all, which provided backlighting for controls and switches. Additionally, to direct attention to the high-quality satin nickel-faced analog clock mounted in the dashboard, an articulating door is present to conceal the radio head unit and optional satellite navigation system when they are not in use.

Highlighting the Navigator&#x27;s design changes were other new features and options for 2003. Newly available features like Ford&#x27;s &quot;Safety Canopy&quot; side curtain airbags and a tire pressure monitoring system improved occupant safety. Convenience was enhanced by the availability of power running boards (an industry first), power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and HID headlights (for top end models). The available rear-seat video entertainment system was updated to be DVD-based and all Navigators now came with standard 18x7.5-inch alloy wheels with 18x8-inch chrome wheels available as an option.

Like the redesigned 2003 Expedition (U222), the Navigator benefited from a reworked chassis, new rack-and-pinion steering, and an all-new independent rear suspension (IRS), which brought better handling and ride comfort. The Navigator continued to benefit from a load-leveling air suspension but it now lowered the vehicle by an inch when stopped in the interest of easing entry and exit. The Navigator&#x27;s powertrain was modified from the UN173, but the 5.4 L DOHC V8 used before was no longer advertised under the InTech name. But it now produced at 5500 rpm and of torque at 3750 rpm. Due to changes brought with the redesign, the Navigator&#x27;s base curb weight increased to in two-wheel drive models and nearly in four-wheel drive models. In turn, towing capacity dropped slightly.

Tire-pressure monitoring was made standard for 2004 while Ford&#x27;s &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot;, a type of traction control system, with Roll Stability Control was an option. For 2005 the Navigator received a minor facelift with new square-shaped foglights replacing the circular ones used previously. AdvanceTrac with RSC was now standard while HID headlights were available on all models. In the interest of cost effectiveness, the 5.4 L DOHC V8 introduced in the 1999 model year was replaced by the same 5.4 L 3-valve SOHC V8 that had been available in the F-150 since the 2004 model year. Though having a different head design, the new engine offered similar overall output, producing at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3750 rpm. The new engine was not marketed under the &quot;Triton&quot; name in the Navigator even though it is mechanically identical to the F-150&#x27;s engine. The 4R75W 4-speed automatic transmission used from 2003 until 2004 was replaced with a new ZF-sourced 6-speed automatic transmission. The 2005 Navigator&#x27;s base curb weight fell to while four-wheel drive models dropped to . Towing capacity increased slightly over the previous model year to in two-wheel drive models and in four-wheel drive models. For 2006, an &quot;Elite&quot; package for the &quot;Ultimate&quot; trim level was made available, including a DVD-based satellite navigation system with a voice-activated touch screen, THX audio system, rear-seat DVD entertainment system, and HID headlights.

=== Navigator K Concept ===
In 2003, Ford Performance Group introduced the Navigator K concept, the first Lincoln concept vehicle from the group. It was unveiled at the New York Auto Show after a rumor that Cadillac was to produce a V12 version of the Escalade EXT. The Navigator K produces 385 horsepower, thanks to the Ford SVT Lightning supercharged 5.4L V8 engine. Feature-wise, it was identical to the “Ultimate” trim level. It was named to pay homage to the Model K, which rejuvenated the Lincoln brand in 1931.

On the exterior, the Navigator K came with 20-inch chrome wheels, a monochromatic scheme, chrome rearview mirrors, chrome front tow hooks, and a polished stainless steel exhaust tip. The interior was available in red only, with satin nickel trim replacing the real walnut burl wood trim that was available in final version of the Navigator. It had red leather seats with black piping all around the bolsters. The steering wheel, unlike production Navigator versions, was all leather-wrapped.

==Third generation (2007–2017)==


The Navigator was redesigned under the U326 program code name, with new styling and mechanical features for 2007. Unveiled at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2006, the Navigator featured its most distinctive styling update since its introduction, with new front and rear fascias and side cladding. In front was a split upper and lower chrome grille with integrated fog lights resembling those of classic Lincolns like the 1946–1948 Continental, along with a more complex headlight design and a more prominent &quot;power dome&quot; hood. Elsewhere, an updated rear fascia featured taillights inspired by the Lincoln MKZ and chrome trim was more prominently used along the sides, including chrome lower body molding on the doors. The interior featured an updated dashboard and instrument panel with an extensive use of rectangular shapes, such as in the gauges, as well as greater use of real wood and satin nickel accents.

Accompanying the Navigator&#x27;s redesign for 2007 was a new model, the Navigator L developed under the U418 program code name. Comparable to the Cadillac Escalade ESV, the Navigator L is longer than the standard Navigator on a longer wheelbase, increasing its cargo capacity. The Navigator L was introduced parallel to the Expedition EL, an extended version of the Ford Expedition. Both the Navigator and Expedition were redesigned for 2007 and based on Ford&#x27;s T1 platform, which is related to the platform of the 2004+ F-150. Compared to the Navigator&#x27;s previous platform, this platform provided greater rigidity for better driving dynamics. The independent rear suspension was replaced with a five-link IRS design to improve handling and ride quality. The Navigator continued to come with standard 18-inch alloy wheels, but both 20- and 22-inch wheels became available. The 5.4 L 3-valve SOHC V8 introduced in the 2005 Navigator remained unchanged for 2007. The ZF Friedrichshafen 6-speed automatic transmission was replaced by Ford&#x27;s own 6-speed design, the 6R80 for the 2009 model year. Due to the Navigator&#x27;s redesign, its base curb weight increased to in two-wheel drive models and in four-wheel drive models. Navigator L models were even heavier, at in two-wheel drive models and in four-wheel drive models. In spite of this, thanks to an improved frame, the Navigator&#x27;s towing capacity increased for 2007, approaching in two-wheel drive models.

After the 2007 model redesign, the Navigator no longer used the same transfer case as the Expedition. Expedition four-wheel drives continued to use a two-speed dual range transfer case with off-road low range reduction gearing and default off-road program that remaps (reprograms) the electronic throttle control and traction control system response for off-road conditions. Navigator four-wheel drives were demoted to a light-duty one-speed single range transfer case which lacks low-range gearing.

For 2008, packaging for the Navigator&#x27;s luxury and convenience features was simplified, resulting in the elimination of the &quot;Luxury&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot; trim levels and the standardization of a number of features that were previously optional. Some of these newly standard features included heated and cooled front seats, power-folding third row seats, a power liftgate, and a 600-watt 14-speaker THX II-Certified audio system. Also newly standard was a 3.31:1 rear axle ratio, though a 3.73:1 ratio was still available as option for the Navigator and remained standard in the Navigator L. Newly available was a rearview camera to aid in backing up.

For 2009, the Navigator&#x27;s 5.4 L V8 gained as well as flex-fuel capability. The rearview camera that was new for 2008 was now standard, as were heated second row seats, &quot;Front Park Assist&quot;, a capless fuel filler, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and Lincoln SYNC.

The third generation Navigator and Navigator L continued to be offered for the 2010 model year, with only slight changes.

For 2011, both the Navigator and the Navigator L featured HD Radio, Sirius TravelLink, and Lincoln SYNC as standard on all trims. The optional 20-inch chrome aluminum wheels offered from 2007 to 2010 were replaced with 20-inch polished aluminum wheels.

For the 2013 model year, the only changes made to the Navigator were the addition of new color trims: Kodiak Brown Metallic Tri-Coat, Midnight Sapphire Metallic, and Ruby Red Metallic Tinted Clearcoat.

The 2014 model year was a carryover from 2013 with the same features and no cosmetic changes. This would be the last model year that it would feature the front grille fascias.

===2015 refresh===

In March 2013, Ford had confirmed reports that the next generation Lincoln Navigator would not be a repackaged Ford Expedition as the previous generations were, despite trailing the MKX in terms of sales but ahead of the MKT, but hopes to make it more competitive in the luxury SUV segment as they prepared to take on the Cadillac Escalade, Infiniti QX80, and the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class, each of which had already or would launch new generations in 2013 or 2014, and would be designed by the new Lincoln design team that also designed the new 2013 MKZ. It would be completely new and would feature the 3.5 Ecoboost, interior and exterior and performance upgrades. But in May 2013 a prototype Navigator with a different front grille was tested featuring the EcoBoost in preparation for the updated Navigator, which was followed by more spy shots taken in September 2013 that was sporting Lincoln&#x27;s updated signature front grille.

On January 22, 2014, three photos of the 2015 Navigator were released on Twitter and Instagram, along with an announcement that the refreshed SUV would be revealed at the Washington Auto Show the following day (January 23, 2014). However, hours after the leaks were made public, Lincoln held a press event in Detroit for the vehicle and revealed the updated Navigator earlier than expected.

The 2015 Navigator and Navigator L kept the same exterior styling design as the Expedition instead of the reported repackaging that was announced earlier by Ford. However, it now featured an updated front grille with the rear tailgate lights bearing a resemblance to the Dodge Durango. The EcoBoost V6 was the only engine offered for the 2015 model year, making and of torque. The exterior included HID headlamps with LED running lights and full LED taillights. Twenty-inch wheels came standard, replacing the 18-inch wheels, while a reserve package featured 22-inch wheels. The dashboard panels features MyLincoln Touch with Sync as standard, controlled through an eight-inch touchscreen display in the dash, and home to twin 4.2-inch displays that flank a central speedometer, falling in line with the rest of the Lincoln models. The push-button start became standard, likewise a passive entry and a rear-view camera. Blind-spot monitoring was added as an optional feature.

Both the updated Navigator and Navigator L went into production in the summer of 2014, and arrived to dealers that fall as a 2015 model.

== Fourth generation (2018–2024) ==

On April 12, 2017, the fourth-generation 2018 Lincoln Navigator was introduced at the 2017 New York Auto Show. As with previous generations, the fourth-generation remains the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Expedition, offered in both a standard and long-wheelbase configuration (Lincoln Navigator L). As before, both two and four-wheel drive versions are offered.

The fourth-generation marked a significant shift in the exterior styling of the Navigator, as it adopted styling features of the 2017 Lincoln Continental. In another major shift, the model line adopted aluminum body construction.

Lincoln refreshed the Navigator for 2022 which was unveiled in August 2021. 

=== Chassis ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator uses the Ford T3 platform, developed under the U554 code name. Retaining body-on-frame construction, the Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) were engineered alongside the 2015 Ford F-150. The four-wheel independent suspension configuration was retained, with a redesigned rear suspension layout.

Shared with the Ford F-150 Raptor, the Lincoln Navigator is equipped with a 450 hp twin-turbocharged 3.5L EcoBoost V6 (although Lincoln has ended its use of the EcoBoost nomenclature). The highest-output engine ever sold by Lincoln, the 3.5L V6 is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission (replacing the previous 6-speed automatic).

=== Body ===
Entering production with only minor differences from the Lincoln Navigator concept vehicle shown at the 2016 New York Auto Show (no inclusion of the gullwing doors and stair-style running boards, used largely for display purposes). The 2018 Lincoln Navigator adopted several design features from the 2017 Lincoln Continental, including the style of its headlights, taillights, side vents, and its front fascia, with a large rectangular grille and a centered Lincoln star emblem. While sharing its roofline and side doors with the Ford Expedition, in the style of Range Rovers, the B, C, and D-pillars are blacked out for a &quot;floating roof&quot; effect.

As with the 2015 Ford F-150, the body of fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator (and Ford Expedition) was designed as a part of a shift to aluminum body construction, with the use of steel largely reserved for the chassis frame rails. Nearly lighter than the previous generation, the fourth-generation Navigator is physically larger than its predecessor, with the standard-wheelbase configuration gaining three inches in wheelbase, while the long-wheelbase L gaining nearly an inch (becoming the longest-wheelbase Lincoln ever produced excluding the Mark LT pickup). In terms of body length, both versions were shortened approximately half an inch.

Shared with the Lincoln Continental, the dashboard of the 2018 Lincoln Navigator replaced a conventional console (or column)-mounted shifter with dashboard-mounted buttons and paddle shifters. In the late 1950s, the Ford Motor company offered mechanical transmission gear selection featured on all 1957 and 1958 Mercury sedans called Multi-Drive which offered a similar approach. For the first time in the model line, the fourth-generation Navigator offers a head-up display along with a 12-inch reconfigurable instrument cluster.

=== Trim ===
The fourth-generation Lincoln Navigator continues the same trim line introduced in the 2015 model update, with Premiere (new to the Navigator for 2018) as the standard trim, Select as the mid-level trim, and Reserve as the highest trim level. Each is powered by a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 with an output of and of torque and comes with a 10-speed automatic transmission.

In addition to other trim changes for the fourth generation, the Black Label series became available for the first time on the Navigator. A series of vehicles with interiors and exteriors coordinated around a theme (similar to the Designer Series Lincolns and Continentals of the 1970s and 1980s), the Navigator was sold during this generation with five Black Label themes: Chalet, Destination, Invitation, Central Park and Yacht Club.

At a base price of approximately $95,000, the Black Label edition of the Lincoln Navigator is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the Ford GT).

== Fifth generation (2025) ==

The fifth generation Navigator was revealed on August 15, 2024 with sales set to commence in the first half of 2025.

The Navigator shares a similar design for the front and rear fascias from the Aviator and Nautilus. It has an illuminated light bar on the grille upfront and a full width LED taillights on the rear. The lights feature Lincoln Embrace welcoming sequence upon vehicle approach. For the first time, the Navigator is available with 24&quot; alloy wheels.

The interior features Lincoln Digital Experience user interface with a 48&quot; full-width display spanning across the top of the dashboard with Google built-in. There is a 11.1&quot; touchscreen used as the control panel. Other interior features include a 28-speaker Revel® Ultima 3D Audio System, Lincoln Digital Scent, Lincoln Rejuvenate and Second-Row Power Tailored Seats.

The independent rear glass opening feature has been ditched for a Split Gate, with the Open on Approach feature. It is also available with a Cargo Tailgate Manager which can be positioned as a bench seatback or a dining table. Another first for the Navigator is power folding third row seats which fold 40/20/40.

For safety, Lincoln BlueCruise hands-free advanced safety assistance system (ADAS) is standard on the Navigator. Other driving assistance features new for the Navigator are Turn Signal View and Intersection Assist.

All models comes with a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 gasoline carried over from the previous model, standard four-wheel drive and adaptive suspension with continuously controlled dampering. 

==Awards==

* On January 14, 2018, The Lincoln Navigator was awarded Truck of the Year at the 2018 North American International Auto Show, marking the first time that a Lincoln vehicle has been given a NAIAS award, as well as the first American-built Luxury Sport Utility Vehicle in this segment to win in this category.
* 2024 Best CPO (Certified Pre-Owned) Value in America Award from Vincentric in the Large Luxury SUV segment for that reason and several others, joining its platform mate – the Ford Expedition – which took home top honors in the Large SUV segment.

<text>Blagg is a tiny lunar impact crater located on the Sinus Medii. It is a circular crater with no appreciable erosion. To the east-southeast is the irregular crater Rhaeticus, and northeast lies Triesnecker. It is about 33 km to the east of the slightly larger Bruce. It was named after noted English astronomer Mary Adela Blagg. Its diameter is 5.0 km.

<doc id="954835" wikidata="Q1016903" url="?curid=954835" title="Burrard Peninsula">
<text>The Burrard Peninsula () is a peninsula in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, bounded by the Burrard Inlet to the north, the Georgia Strait to the west, the North Arm of Fraser River to the south, and the Pitt River and Douglas Island to the east. The City of Vancouver occupies almost all of the western half of the peninsula, and the Cities of Burnaby and New Westminster occupy more than half of the eastern half. At its northeastern end, the peninsula is connected to the Eagle Mountain and Mount Burke of the Coast Mountains via a small isthmus at the center of the Tri-Cities.

The Squamish name for the Burrard Peninsula as a whole — or rather, for the long rise of land from Point Grey to Central Park, was Ulksen or Ulxen. The name Burrard Peninsula is rarely used in casual reference to the area among locals in favour of a specific community or neighbourhood therein.

==Extent==
There is no clear consensus on where the peninsula ends, as the Burrard Peninsula does not appear in official government gazetteers (directories of geographical features) and does not exist as a legal entity, thus having no legal definition. The peninsula is however attached to the mainland at its northeastern end, and as a matter of convenience, the isthmus may be taken to follow the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) across the relatively narrow, low neck of land from Port Moody at the eastern end of Burrard Inlet, through Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam southeast to the bank of Pitt River. From where the CPR tracks cross the Pitt River, the Burrard Peninsula runs due west for approximately to Point Grey. The peninsula is approximately wide (north-south) for much of its length. Though it is a peninsula and is attached to the mainland, it cannot be accessed directly from the mainland without crossing some body of water - either the Pitt River, the Fraser River, or the Burrard Inlet - as the connection to the mainland is blocked by Coquitlam Mountain and other mountainous terrain.

==Municipalities==
Municipalities on the peninsula include — in roughly west-to-east order—the Cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, New Westminster, Port Moody, Coquitlam and Port Coquitlam. The University Endowment Lands and the main campus of University of British Columbia occupy the unincorporated territory of Point Grey at the far west end of the peninsula. Northwest of the peninsular neck are the villages of Belcarra and Anmore, both of which are not part of the peninsula &quot;proper&quot; but are only accessible by road via the Burrard Peninsula.

==Landforms==
The Burrard Peninsula, for the most part, consists of a hilly low plateau reaching a maximum elevation between above sea level in most places. The plateau is bisected by a low depression running northwest to southeast, consisting of (running from west to east):
*False Creek, separating the peninsula &quot;proper&quot; from Downtown Vancouver, which sits on a peninsular offshoot referred to as &quot;Downtown Peninsula&quot; or occasionally &quot;Coal Peninsula&quot;
*the Canadian National Railway (CN) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) railway yards, which sit on reclaimed land at the east end of False Creek;
*the Grandview Cut, a trench that accommodates CNR/BNSF and SkyTrain tracks;
*Still Creek, which drains into Burnaby Lake;
*Burnaby Lake, which drains into the Brunette River; and
*the Brunette River, which is the last tributary of any significant size of the Fraser River, joining the Fraser at New Westminster.
Punctuating the plateau are several prominences of land including Little Mountain (a dormant volcano, approximately 170 metres above sea level) in Vancouver, and Capitol Hill (approximately 220 metres) and Burnaby Mountain (home to the main campus of Simon Fraser University; approximately 380 metres) in Burnaby. The plateau is flanked at its eastern end by the Coquitlam River, which flows south from Coquitlam Lake on the mainland into the Fraser River, its mouth lying upstream from the Brunette River. The land east of the Coquitlam River is largely flat and lying close to sea level, except for the stand-alone rise of Mary Hill in Port Coquitlam (approximately 70 metres).

==Land use==
The Burrard Peninsula has been extensively urbanized, and includes the largest and densest populations in the Metro Vancouver region, and in British Columbia more generally.

While originally extensively forested, since the mid-19th century the Burrard Peninsula has gradually become essentially one large cityscape. Its largest remaining green spaces include Pacific Spirit Regional Park in Point Grey, Stanley Park in Downtown Vancouver, the areas around Burnaby Mountain, Central Park, Burnaby Lake, and Deer Lake in Burnaby, and Mundy Park and the Coquitlam River in Coquitlam.

<text>Neelie Kroes (; born 19 July 1941) is a retired Dutch politician of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and businessperson who served as European Commissioner from 22 November 2004 to 1 November 2014.

Kroes studied Economics at the Rotterdam School of Economics obtaining a Master of Economics degree. Kroes worked as a researcher at her alma mater from September 1963 to April 1968, and as a corporate director for a transport company in Delft from April 1968 until August 1971, and for the chamber of commerce of Rotterdam from July 1969 until August 1971. Kroes became a Member of the House of Representatives shortly after the election of 1971 on 3 August 1971, and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Transport and Education. After the election of 1977 Kroes was appointed as State Secretary for Transport and Water Management in the Cabinet Van Agt–Wiegel taking office on 28 December 1977. After the election of 1981 Kroes returned to the House of Representatives on 25 August 1981, and again served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Transport. After the election of 1982 Kroes was appointed as Minister of Transport and Water Management in the Cabinet Lubbers I taking office on 4 November 1982. After the election of 1986 Kroes continued her office in the Cabinet Lubbers II. In June 1989, Kroes announced that she wouldn&#x27;t stand for the election of 1989.

Kroes semi-retired from active politics and became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government, and served as Rector Magnificus of the Nyenrode Business University from June 1991 until January 2000. In October 2004, Kroes was nominated as the next European Commissioner in the First Barroso Commission, and was given the heavy portfolio of Competition taking office on 22 November 2004. In November 2009, Kroes was re-nominated for a second term in the Second Barroso Commission, and was given the heavy portfolio of Digital Agenda and was appointed as one of the Vice-Presidents serving from 9 February 2010 until 1 November 2014.

Kroes retired from active politics at the age of 73 and again became active in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served as an occasional diplomat for several economic delegations on behalf of the government. Following her retirement Kroes continued to be active as an advocate and lobbyist for promoting startup companies and entrepreneurship. She holds the distinction as the first female Minister of Transport starting an informal tradition of women serving as Dutch Transport Ministers that has continued since 1982 (save for two exceptions 2002–2003 and 2007–2010) for over year.

==Career before politics==
Neelie Kroes was born on 19 July 1941 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Her father owned the transport company Zwatra.

Kroes attended a Protestant grammar school in Rotterdam. She continued to a Protestant high school. In 1958, she went to study economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. In 1961, Kroes was praeses of the R.V.S.V. (the largest Rotterdam sorority). She was also elected as a member of the University Council. After obtaining a Bachelor of Economics and later a Master of Economics degree in 1965, she became a research fellow at the economic faculty at that university. During this period Kroes was involved in the women&#x27;s organisation within the VVD. In this period she also was member of the board of heavy transporting company &quot;ZwaTra&quot;, the company of her father.


==Local and national politics==
Neelie Kroes was first elected member of the Rotterdam city council for the VVD in 1970.

In 1971, she was elected to the House of Representatives, forcing her to stop her fellowship. In parliament, she became spokesperson for education. She remained a member of parliament until 1977, when she became State Secretary for Transport, Public Works and Water Management in the First Van Agt Cabinet, responsible for Postal and Telephone Services and Transport. In 1981, she briefly returned to the House of Representatives, while her party, VVD, was in the opposition. In 1982 she returned to office in the First and Second Lubbers Cabinets, now as the Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, a post that she held until 1989. As a minister she was responsible for the privatisation of the Postgiro (Postbank, initially a part of the PTT), the Post and Telephone Services, the Harbour Pilotage services, as well as the commissioning of the Betuwe Railway.

Kroes refused to become Minister of Defence in 1988.

During her tenure as minister, she was involved in the so-called TCR affair, about the illegal sale of warships. She had also a business relationship with a tank cleaning company (TCR), which illegally received governmental subsidies.

==After National Politics==
After her ministerial career, Kroes spent two years working on two projects as an advisor to Karel van Miert, at that time European Commissioner for Transport. She also became a member of the Rotterdam Chamber of Commerce, furthermore she served as a board member for Ballast Nedam (shipping), ABP-PGGM Capital Holdings N.V. (a joint subsidiary of the pension funds ABP and PGGM), NIB (an investment bank), McDonald&#x27;s Netherlands, Nedlloyd, and Nederlandse Spoorwegen (the Dutch railroad company).

In 1991, Kroes became chairperson of Nyenrode University, a private business school. During this period Kroes also was a member of the Advisory Board of the Prof.Mr. B.M. Teldersstichting, the scientific bureau of VVD.

According to her husband, Bram Peper, from 1993 to 2001, Kroes relied on astrologers and clairvoyants for personal and business advice. Until 2004 Kroes maintained an office in the castle of Jan-Dirk Paarlberg, a real estate mogul who was convicted to four and a half years in prison for money-laundering and extortion. One of the astrologers advising Kroes during that time was Lenie Drent, who had been providing business advice to Paarlberg for decades.

Kroes has held and still holds many side offices, mainly in cultural and social organisations. She is chairperson of &quot;Poets of all Nations&quot;, the &quot;Delta Psychiatric Hospital&quot; and of the board of the Rembrandt House Museum. Also, she was a member of several boards of commissioners, for instance at Nedlloyd (a shipping company) and Lucent Technologies (an information and communication technologies company).

==European Commission==
===Commissioner for Competition===
In 2004, Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition. At the time, her nomination was heavily criticised because of her ties to big business and alleged involvement in shady arms deals. Kroes has tried to uphold her integrity; whenever she has to deal with issues concerning competition in branches of industry in which she used to be active as a board member, Commissioner McCreevy takes over her responsibilities.

As chairperson of Nyenrode Business University, Kroes awarded an honorary doctorate to Microsoft founder Bill Gates in 1996. As a European Commissioner for Competition one of her first tasks in 2004 was to oversee the sanctions against Microsoft by the European Commission, known as the European Union Microsoft competition case. This case resulted in the requirement to release documents to aid commercial interoperability and included a €497 million fine for Microsoft.

Kroes attended conferences organized by the Bilderberg Group every year between 2005 and 2012.

In 2009, she was transferred to another European Commissioner post, namely ICT and Telecom. She was also appointed as one of the vice-presidents of the European Commission.

===Commissioner for Digital Agenda===
In 2010, she became European Commissioner for Digital Agenda in the second Barroso Commission. The Digital Agenda for Europe was proposed by the European Commission on 19 May 2010.

The Digital Agenda for Europe is supported by the EU Digital Competitiveness Report launched also on 19 May 2010. She is a proponent of Free and Open Source Software.

Since 2010, she has served as a Commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Digital Development which leverages broadband technologies as a key enabler for social and economic development.

In 2010, it was suggested that she would become prime-minister in the Netherlands, when Mark Rutte would stay in parliament due to difficulties in the formations in the new Cabinet. However, eventually Rutte became prime-minister.

In December 2011, Kroes invited Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg who had resigned as German Minister of Defence in March 2011, due to plagiarism charges – as advisor to the European Commission as part of its &quot;No Disconnect Strategy&quot; designed to promote Internet freedom.

In November 2012, Kroes made international news when she said her advisers at the Internet Governance Forum in Baku, Azerbaijan had been the victims of computer hacking.

==Later career==
Kroes is currently leading &quot;StartupDelta&quot;, a public-private initiative to help promote the Netherlands as a destination for startup companies. For the 2019 European elections, she was brought into the European election campaign by Guy Verhofstadt&#x27;s Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open VLD) in Belgium.

In addition, Kroes has been holding a variety of paid and unpaid positions.

==Controversy==
At the end of the 1980s, intensive research into environmental crime among chemical waste processing companies ended in a fiasco. As Minister of Transport, Public Works and Water Management, Kroes had conceived the plan to provide subsidies to the companies TCA and TCR (Tanker Cleaning Amsterdam and Rotterdam, respectively). Even though she was made aware of the company&#x27;s criminal activities, including mixing chemical waste into fuel oil, she pushed through with the subsidies. The resulting TCR affair sparked a parliamentary inquiry in 1997. Kroes was accused by the investigative committee that she had helped a rogue company with a government subsidy into the saddle, which made the environmental crimes possible.

In the mid-1990s, Kroes was involved in the frigate affair: the failed purchase of six Dutch frigates (amounting to 1.2 billion euros) by the United Arab Emirates. As chairman of a consortium of Holland Signaal, Ballast Nedam and Koninklijke Schelde (supported by the navy, the Port of Rotterdam Authority and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs), Kroes attempted to exchange the frigates for oil supplies. When it turned out that she was also using her chairmanship to serve the business interests of a personal friend, the businessman Joop van Caldenborgh, she was removed from her position by the government. It was only in 2011 that it became known that she had also put Prince Bernhard forward as a lobbyist in this deal, in violation of the agreements that Bernhard had made with the Den Uyl cabinet after the Lockheed affair. The frigate affair brought Kroes into contact with Jordanian investor Amin Badr-El-Din, with whom she would run the company Mint Holdings some years later, which was planning to take over part of Enron.

In 2016, leaks to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (who also oversaw the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks) revealed that from 2001 to 2009 Kroes was the director of Mint Holdings, a company registered in the Bahamas. As part of the EU rules, a commissioner is obliged to declare previous and current economic interests, but she did not declare her directorship of the Bahamas company. Further, EU commissioners are not allowed to hold outside directorships while in office (Kroes was in office 2004–2014). According to her lawyer, Kroes acknowledged the situation, calling it an &quot;oversight&quot;, and declared that she would take full responsibility.

The “Uber files”, leaked documents in 2022, revealing active and irregular efforts of Uber in lobbying regulators, revealed that Kroes prepared her appointment at the taxi company when she was still in office. 
She did not disclose the numerous appointments she had with firms executives when European Commissioner for competition and then new technologies (a position she held until November 2014). 
After resigning from the European Commission, she actively helped Uber bending regulations by opening her contacts to the company, including Netherlands then Prime Minister Mark Rutte, breaking her 18-months duty of réserve that ex commissioner must apply. She finally joins Uber Public Affairs team in 2016.

==Personal life==
Kroes was married to social democratic minister and mayor Bram Peper. She is a confidant of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, known for her criticism of Islam and having a fatwa issued, and persuaded her to switch allegiance from the social democratic PvdA to the VVD.

===Corporate boards===
* Uber, Member of the Public Policy Advisory Board
* Salesforce, Non-Executive Board Board of Directors (since 2016)

===Non-profit organizations===
* Open Data Institute, Non-Executive Member of the Board (since 2015)

==Recognition==
===Awards===
Kroes was International Road Federation Man of the Year of 1993.

Kroes made the Forbes&#x27; The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women list multiple times: as number 53 in 2009, 47 in 2008, 59 in 2007.

<doc id="954844" wikidata="Q1760333" url="?curid=954844" title="Lincoln Aviator">
<text>The Lincoln Aviator is a mid-size, three-row luxury SUV manufactured and marketed under the Lincoln brand of Ford Motor Company — and now in its second generation, with a hiatus from 2006 to 2020.

The first generation Aviator was manufactured for 2003–2005 model years as a rebadged variant of the third generation Ford Explorer — and assembled at the now-closed St. Louis Assembly in Hazelwood, Missouri, alongside the Explorer and Mountaineer.

For the 2020 model year, Lincoln reintroduced the Aviator as a badge engineered variant of the sixth generation Ford Explorer manufactured at Chicago Assembly and offered with a plug-in hybrid variant.

== First generation (UN152; 2003) ==
The Aviator was launched for the 2003 model year with three-row six-passenger seating configuration and optional second row bucket seats with center console or second-row bench seating (at no cost).

Along with the choice of four-wheel drive (4WD) configuration and towing packages, the Aviator was offered with optional heated/cooled front bucket seats, xenon (HID) headlights, 17-inch chrome wheels, and a DVD-based navigation system. These options were late availability in 2003 on the premium model and 2004 (&quot;Ultimate&quot;), 2005 (&quot;Elite&quot;). The Aviator was equipped with dual front/side airbags, side-curtain airbags, stability and traction control.

=== Chassis ===
Sharing its chassis with the third-generation Explorer, the Aviator is derived from the body-on-frame Ford U1 platform. Sharing its wheelbase with the Explorer/Mountaineer, the Aviator is fitted with four-wheel independent suspension.

A standard towing package was fitted to all 4WD Aviators with a heavy-duty towing package optional on either rear-wheel drive (RWD) or 4WD models.

=== Powertrain ===
In place of the SOHC two-valve version of the 4.6 L &quot;Modular&quot; V8 shared with the Explorer/Mountaineer and other Ford trucks, the Aviator was fitted with the DOHC four-valve version of the engine, shared with the Mustang Mach 1 and Marauder.

Producing and of torque, the DOHC V8 engine in the Aviator came with two more horsepower than the 5.4-L V8 in the Navigator (though with less of torque). As with the Explorer/Mountaineer, rear-wheel drive was standard, with Lincoln offering all-wheel drive as an option; all versions were equipped with a five-speed &quot;5R55S&quot; overdrive automatic 
transmission.

=== Body ===
The Aviator derived its body construction from the third-generation Explorer, sharing its body structure, doors, and roofline with both model lines. The Aviator adopts a number of styling cues from the second-generation Navigator, with visually similar front and rear stayling, lower door panels/running boards, grilles, and headlamps, and license-plate surrounds. Styled similar to later-1960s Lincolns, the rectangular-designed instrument panel featured an instrument cluster with electroluminescent gauges and needles. The Aviator received model-specific seats and leather, with American walnut wood trim on the doors and steering wheel.

=== Trim ===
At its 2002 launch, the Aviator was offered in &quot;Luxury&quot; base trim and &quot;Premium&quot; trim level. For 2004, the &quot;Premium&quot; trim was renamed &quot;Ultimate.&quot;. For 2005, the &quot;Luxury&quot; trim became the sole offering, with previous content remaining available as stand-alone options, including a rear-seat DVD player. An &quot;Elite&quot; option package was offered, which bundled all features of the &quot;Premium&quot;/&quot;Ultimate&quot; trims; the package offered a DVD-based navigation system.

==== Kitty Hawk Special Edition ====
To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and the 100th anniversary of Ford Motor Company, Lincoln offered a &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; limited edition of the Aviator; it was the official vehicle of the 2003 EAA Countdown to Kitty Hawk. Along with special Kitty Hawk badging and trim, the limited-edition featured mink zebrano wood trim, argent painted and chrome grille, and a rear spoiler, chrome exhaust tip, chrome wheels, xenon (HID) headlamps, black premium leather heated/cooled seats with Kitty Hawk logo embossed on front seatbacks, black carpet floor mats with stitched Kitty Hawk logo, available only in black exterior color.

=== Marketing and reception ===
Lincoln played up the similarity to the Navigator full-size SUV with magazine ads that read, &quot;Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Especially when it&#x27;s yourself you&#x27;re imitating.&quot; The Aviator was met with relatively positive press coverage.

While the Aviator&#x27;s styling borrowed cues from its big brother, the Navigator, it also looked similar to the very widespread Explorer with which it shared the platform. Also working against the Aviator was the fact that it was priced similar to the larger and relatively popular Expedition. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; said in a comparison test, in which the Aviator tied for fifth place, that only the car&#x27;s high price and lack of certain features and no low range with the 4WD model held it out of contention for the top spots.

=== Replacement ===
The first-generation Lincoln Aviator was discontinued after the 2005 model year, with the final vehicle produced by St. Louis Assembly on August 19, 2005. At the 2004 Detroit Auto Show, Lincoln previewed an intended second generation. In a break from the Explorer/Mountaineer, the model line was shifting its design from a three-row SUV to a two-row crossover SUV, becoming a Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Edge CUV. The second-generation Aviator was released as an early 2007 vehicle.

IN 2007, Lincoln rebranded its model line, adopting an &quot;MK&quot; model across its lineup, with the exception of the Navigator and the Town Car. The Aviator nameplate was dropped, becoming the Lincoln MKX (X= crossover); based on the Ford CD3 platform, the production MKX served as a counterpart of the Ford Edge.

== Second generation (U611; 2020) ==
At the 2018 New York Auto Show, Lincoln unveiled a prototype version of its planned second-generation Aviator, scheduled to enter production in 2019.

A more detailed production was later introduced at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 28, 2018. Lincoln confirmed that the Aviator would go on sale in the summer of 2019 as a 2020 model in North America and China afterward.

With and of torque and all of the power and torque coming from a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 with a hybrid system, the Aviator Hybrid&#x27;s output makes it on par with likes of other midsized performance SUVs such as the BMW X5 xDrive 50i ( and ), and the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid ( and ).

===Overview ===
The 2018 Aviator prototype marked the debut of an all-new vehicle platform for Ford Motor Company; while the vehicle is RWD, the architecture is designed for multiple powertrain layouts, including all-wheel drive (AWD) and front-wheel drive (FWD). The second-generation Aviator shares its platform architecture with the sixth-generation Explorer. While again mechanically related to the Explorer, the Aviator received its own styling.

No specific engine or transmission details were announced as part of the unveiling; the production Aviator will offer plug-in hybrid (PHEV) capability as an option, the first Lincoln vehicle to do so.

Several technological features debuted on the 2018 prototype Aviator. Tying the vehicle camera system with the continuously controlled dampers, &quot;Suspension Preview Technology&quot; looks at the road ahead for surface irregularities (i.e., potholes), preparing the suspension for impact and its effect on vehicle ride. &quot;Phone as a Key&quot; allows an Aviator to be driven without keys; the technology allows the smartphone of the owner to serve as the vehicle key fob, with the door-mounted keyless entry keypad allowing access in the event of phone battery failure (the interior is designed with wireless charging for smartphones).

A number of safety technology features were included, with &quot;Lincoln CoPilot360&quot; packaging automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, a blind-spot information system with cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping system, lane centering, reverse camera, and auto high-beams. &quot;Reverse Brake Assist&quot; applies the brakes if the vehicle detects an object when the transmission is in reverse.

Lincoln designers worked with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra to compose 25 unique sound effects to be used for the door chime and other indicator alerts for the Aviator.

=== 2025 refresh ===
The facelifted Aviator was revealed on February 5, 2024, for the 2025 model year. It features a redesigned front fascia, refreshed interior and redesigned headlights. The PHEV Grand Touring trim was discontinued for 2025.

<text>is a lake in the Snowdonia National Park in Gwynedd, north-west Wales.

==Geography==

It is found at approximately above sea level in a cwm on the eastern flanks of Snowdon. It is a rough ellipse in shape, about east–west and about north–south, and the Miners&#x27; Track runs along the northern shore.

It has a maximum depth of 39 m (127 feet), and contains about of water.

Glaslyn is the source of the Afon Glaslyn, the major river of Gwynedd, which runs east to the reservoir of Llyn Llydaw before turning south-west to reach the sea at Porthmadog.

In 2020, small particles of microplastic pollution – deposited by rain – were found in the lake, triggering a further investigation of the extent of environmental damage in UK lakes and mountains.

==Folklore==

In Welsh folklore, Arthur had Bedivere throw his sword &quot;Excalibur&quot; into Glaslyn, where Arthur&#x27;s body was later placed in a boat to be carried away to Afallon. Arthur&#x27;s men then retreated to a cave on the slopes of Y Lliwedd, where they are said to sleep until such time as they are needed. Merlin is supposed to have hidden the golden throne of Britain among the cliffs north of Crib y Ddysgl when the Saxons invaded.

Glaslyn was also the final resting place of a water monster, known as an &quot;&quot; (also the Welsh word for beaver), which had plagued the people of the Conwy valley. They tempted the monster out of the water with a young girl, before securing it with chains and dragging it to Glaslyn. A large stone known as Maen Du&#x27;r Arddu, below Clogwyn Du&#x27;r Arddu, is supposed to have magical powers. Like several other sites in Wales, it is said that if two people spend the night there, one will become a great poet while the other will become insane. Llyn Coch in Cwm Clogwyn has been associated with the Tylwyth Teg (fairies), including a version of the fairy bride legend.

<doc id="954847" wikidata="Q1922275" url="?curid=954847" title="Mandsaur">
<text>Mandsaur is a city and a municipality in Mandsaur district located on the border of Mewar and Malwa regions of Madhya Pradesh, a state in Central India. It is the administrative headquarters of Mandsaur District. The ancient Pashupatinath Temple is located in Mandsaur. Later come under Gwalior state Which was 2nd biggest state. Mandsaur is famous for its opium farming.

==Name==
Mandsaur is identified with the city of Daśapura, which is attested in various ancient and medieval texts and inscriptions. According to the 12th-century Jain work called the &quot;Pariśiṣṭaparvan&quot;, the name &quot;Daśapura&quot; was given to the city by a group of merchants visiting the royal fortress of a king named Udayana and his ten sons.

==History==

===Aulikaras of Dashapura===
Epigraphical discoveries have brought to light two ancient royal houses, who call themselves as Aulikaras and ruled from Dashapura (present-day Mandsaur). The first dynasty, who ruled from Dashapura from the beginning comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Jayavarma, Simhavarma, Naravarma, Vishvavarma and Bandhuvarma. The Risthal stone slab inscription discovered in 1983 has brought to light another Aulikara dynasty, which comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Drumavardhana, Jayavardhana Ajitavardhana, Vibhishanavardhana, Rajyavardhana and Prakashadharma. After Parakshadharma, the ruler of Mandsaur was Yashodharma, who is identified with Vishnuvardhana, who erected a pillar of victory at Bayana due to which Bayana&#x27;s name became Vijaygarh. In all probabilities, he was the son and immediate successor of Prakashadharma.

=== Yashodharman rule ===

Sondani (सोंधनी) is a small village at a distance of about 4 km from Mandsaur situated on Mahu-Nimach Highway towards Mahu. In a part of the inscription Yasodharman praises himself for having defeated king Mihirakula:

===Gurjara-Pratihara Dynasty===

The Gurjara Pratihara empire was extended up to Mandasor during the reign of Mahendrapala II.

=== Medieval era ===
There are two gardens in which there is a pillar of torandwar. It is believed to be pillar of Surya Mandir of the inscription of Bandhu Varma. There is a Shiva statue also in the garden.

=== Maratha Empire ===
The Battle of Mandsaur took place in Mandsaur, India between the Maratha Army and Jai Singh II of Amber.
In February 1732, the Marathas completely surrounded Jai Singh with their enormous cavalry and started cutting of his supplies. The Jaipur Raja was forced to sue for peace, he offered the Marathas six lakhs, but Holkar refused and demanded more. While the negotiations were taking place, a rumour surfaced about reinforcements from the emperor. This raised the morale of the Jaipur army and the Rajputs got ready for battle, the Marathas quickly attacked the rearguard of the Jaipur army and killed its commander. The Rajputs also attacked and killed fifteen Maratha officers in the fight that followed. Holkar and his men retreated 30 miles away from the battlefield. Jai Singh followed them but was outpaced by the Maratha cavalry who reached Jai Singhs camp and forced him to surrender.
Jai Singh was forced to give six lakhs to Holkar and allow him to collect chauth from 28 pargana&#x27;s in Malwa.
The Maratha victory at the Battle of Mandsaur had the following consequences:
Scindias and Holkars were emboldened to renew their attack on Rajputana.
Kota and Bundi were made the next targets in the same year by the Marathas.

=== Princely State ===
In 19th century before India&#x27;s independence in 1947, Mandsaur was part of the princely state of Gwalior. It gave its name to the treaty with the Holkar Maharaja of Indore, who concluded the Third Anglo-Maratha War and the Pindari War in 1818. At the turn of the 20th century it was a centre of the Malwa opium trade.

=== Mention in Kalidas Manuscript ===

<text>Bruce is a small lunar impact crater located in the small lunar mare Sinus Medii. It lies to the west-northwest of the irregular crater Rhaeticus, and is about 33 km to the west of the even smaller Blagg. It is named for Catherine Wolfe Bruce, an American philanthropist and patroness of astronomy.

This feature is circular and cup-shaped, with no notable impacts overlaying the rim or interior. The interior has a generally higher albedo than the surrounding terrain, but there is a band of darker material cross the midpoint of the crater from west to east. It is surrounded by lunar mare, with a few tiny craterlets in the surface to the east.

Less than forty kilometres to the southeast is the original point of the selenographic coordinate system. From the floor of this crater the Earth always appears at the zenith. Both the Surveyor 4 and Surveyor 6 probes landed about 50 km to the southwest of Bruce.

<text>is a natural lake in Snowdonia National Park on the flanks of Snowdon, Wales&#x27; highest mountain. This long thin lake has formed in a cwm about one-third of the way up the mountain. It is one of the most visited lakes in the United Kingdom, in that many thousands of people every year visit Snowdon and many walk past this lake on the Miners&#x27; Track.

== History ==
Llyn Llydaw is the largest of the three lakes on Snowdon&#x27;s eastern flank. Higher up lies Glaslyn, and lower down lies Llyn Teyrn.

In 1905, a pipeline was built from the lake into the valley below. Water from the lake powers the Cwm Dyli hydroelectric power station below. The pipeline and power station continue to operate.

== Popular culture ==
The lake featured in Robson Green&#x27;s &quot;Wild Swimming Adventure&quot; (ITV December 2009), chosen because it is claimed to be the coldest lake in Britain. Green&#x27;s website states that the water was 7 °C.

<doc id="954858" wikidata="Q810984" url="?curid=954858" title="Battle Arena Toshinden">
<text>Battle Arena Toshinden, released as in Japan, is a 1995 fighting video game developed by Tamsoft and published by Takara for the PlayStation. It was one of the first fighting games, after &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; on arcade and console, to boast polygonal characters in a 3D environment, and features a sidestep maneuver which is credited for taking the genre into &quot;true 3D.&quot;

Toy giant Takara produced the game during a six month period in 1994 as their first original video game, together with new developer Tamsoft, both of whom had worked on porting &quot;Samurai Showdown&quot; and other SNK fighters to consoles. Initially made to be a PlayStation exclusive, the game was released in Japan a few weeks after the console&#x27;s debut, and released internationally by Sony Computer Entertainment as a launch title. Its American division had promoted it as a &quot;Saturn killer&quot; (against Sega&#x27;s &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;), but ironically a Saturn port published by Sega, titled Battle Arena Toshinden Remix and with additional features, was released less than a year later. A 2D version was developed and released for the Game Boy in 1996, published internationally by Nintendo, making it the only game to have been published by all of the largest console manufacturers of its time. A version for MS-DOS was also released.

A weapons-based fighter, &quot;Toh Shin Den&quot; features eight anime-style characters — the work of Tsukasa Kotobuki — and has gameplay mechanics such as special and projectile attacks akin to 2D fighters like &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Critically acclaimed&quot;&quot; for graphical innovations like gouraud shading and transparent effects, &quot;Toh Shin Den&quot; was a popular early title on the PlayStation and it spawned sequels starting with &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden 2,&quot; as well as manga and anime adaptations. However, a lackluster reception to its sequels meant that it was overshadowed by the &quot;Tekken&quot; series, especially with &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, and it fell in popularity. The weapons concept was then further popularized by &quot;Soul Edge&quot;.

==Gameplay==

Each character has their own unique set of basic moves, special attacks, and a desperation attack that can only be used when the player has low energy (around 10% or less). The player can move around the arenas using the L/R shoulder buttons, which can be used to dodge projectile attacks or get away from a dangerous spot.

Players move using the directional pad. Holding the backward directional button allows the player to block basic attacks and reduces most of the damage from opponents&#x27; special moves. Players can also run by quickly tapping the forward directional button.

As with other games of the genre, the player wins by depleting the opposing players health, having more health than their opponent if the time runs out, or knocking their opponent out of the non-walled arena. Unlike many fighting games of the time, it was possible for a player character to accidentally fall off the arena with a miss-timed run or special move, resulting in some unique tactics.

The main single-player mode only consists of battles against all characters followed by the boss, while the other mode is for a single battle against an opponent chosen by the player. However the enhanced &quot;Remix&quot; version on Sega Saturn does have a story mode.

==Plot and characters==
Throughout the criminal underworld, announcements of a famed underworld tournament reemerging after a long hiatus has made word throughout the globe. Known as the Battle Arena Toshinden, this underworld tournament is a weapons fighting tournament broadcast as bloodsport entertainment for an elite and interested audience. Hosted by a mysterious organization known only as the Secret Society, believed to be related to a world leading multinational megaconglomerate, the Gerard Foundation, the Secret Society has picked eight worthy challengers from around the world to pit against each other for the chance at a prize for fortune, fame, and glory.

Initial playable characters are:
* - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese traveling swordsman/adventurer who seeks to find his long-lost older brother, Sho. Eiji progresses through the tournament and ultimately comes face-to-face with the tournament&#x27;s sponsor, the mysterious Gaia
* - A Scottish (later retconned as English) swordsman/bounty hunter, a friend and rival of Eiji. He seeks to avenge the death of his foster father, who was killed by the previous tournament&#x27;s champion from last year.
* - A whip-wielding blonde Russian woman who works as a private detective. She seeks to find and recover her long-lost memories.
* - A strong yet kind-hearted American miner who seeks to rescue his wife Lila and his son Christopher from the Secret Society.
* - An elderly Chinese magician who is secretly a cold-hearted serial killer. Fo Fai enters the tournament to satisfy his bloodlust.
* - An emotionless Japanese ninja warrior who infiltrates the tournament under the orders from a rival group of the Secret Society.
* - An arrogant French knight who seeks to find and defeat Eiji to avenge a past loss to him.
* - A cheerful and kind-hearted Turkish orphaned dancer of a traveling theater troupe who seeks to discover whether or not her long-lost missing father is still alive.

Unlockable characters:
* - The sponsor of the tournament, boss of the game, and main antagonist. His reasons for holding the tournament in the first place are shrouded in mystery. He is later revealed to be the father of Ellis.
* - The secret final boss of the game, reached by clearing the game without continues. The champion from last year&#x27;s previous tournament and Eiji&#x27;s older brother, he is a merciless swordsman who holds nothing back from within the fights that he participates in.
* Cupido (Sega Saturn version) - A mysterious woman who speaks with cryptic riddles and messages. Her past is shrouded in mystery, and not much is known about her. She is the &quot;true&quot; final boss in this version.
* Uranus (Game Boy version) - The final boss in this version. Of unknown origin, she is the second-in-command of the Himitsu Kessha, a criminal organization.
* Earthworm Jim (PC version, rendered in Japanese as &quot;ジム&quot;) - A guest character. His attacks are identical to those of Rungo Iron.

==Development and release==
&quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was developed by Tamsoft, an in-house developer part of the Takara toy company and their first original game. Takara had been concepting &quot;Toshinden&quot; on a different platform before Sony&#x27;s announcement in late 1993 of releasing a new hardware system, after which Takara decided to develop the game specifically on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation platform. Development took under six months. Programming began at the end of May 1994 and there were 25 people working on it by the end of development.

According to Takara executives, about 1,000 polygons were used for each character. The inspiration of some of the characters came from the Japanese tradition of bushido; Takara had already published SNK titles including &quot;Samurai Showdown&quot; based on similar themes. &quot;Toshinden&quot;&#x27;s 3D environment naturally drew comparisons with &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. In an interview, Takara boasted that the game had more realistic three-dimensionality:

The November 1994 issue of Japanese magazine &quot;Game Blast&quot; noted that the game was 30% completed, although the game was completed shortly before the console&#x27;s domestic debut on December 3, 1994 with a release on January 1, 1995. Magazines just before the time of its release also named it &quot;Hyper Solid Toshinden&quot;. In September 1995 the game was released in North American and PAL regions as a launch title. This version has slightly altered music and re-done the English voices, with the character Sofia sounding less suggestive and Ellis sounding older than in the original Japanese version.

=== Toshinden Remix on Saturn ===
At E3 1995 before the American PlayStation release, &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was promoted as a &quot;Saturn killer&quot; to be a rival to the Sega Saturn. After Polygon Man was dropped, Sony Computer Entertainment America used the &quot;Toshinden&quot; character Sofia as a mascot. Despite this, Takara later announced that the game is to be ported by Nextech/Sega to the Sega Saturn as Toh Shin Den S in Japan and as Battle Arena Toshinden Remix internationally. A few new features were added, including an exclusive new character named Cupido and a story mode with dialog and voice acting (also dubbed in English), which enables the player to learn a few details about the characters&#x27; story backgrounds and the reasons of why they had entered into the tournament. The character select screen depicts original anime art by Tsukasa Kotobuki instead of rendered models and these also appear in the story mode. Work on the Saturn port reportedly began while the PlayStation original was still in development.

=== PC and handheld ports ===
California-based Digital Dialect reprogrammed the game for DOS, and this version was released in 1996 published by Playmates Interactive. This version plays and looks differently. Earthworm Jim, which was the property of Playmates, was added as an exclusive guest character, with his unique arena music, but he only uses the moves of Rungo Iron. It uses the Japanese PlayStation version&#x27;s voices and music in all regions, albeit at lower sound quality. The DOS version also supports resolutions up to 640x480 and network multiplayer using IPX/SPX or NetBIOS.

The game was ported to the Game Boy by Takara/Nintendo in 1996, titled Nettou Toshinden (熱闘闘神伝) in Japan. It was the fourth of Takara&#x27;s &#x27;Nettou&#x27; (&quot;Dead Heat Fighters&quot;) series of games with deformed characters ported to the Game Boy, following &quot;World Heroes 2 Jet&quot;. The game is based mostly on the original PlayStation version, but it includes a slightly altered story mode and two appearances from &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden 2&quot;: the characters Uranus and Gaia (without his armor).

An emulated version for the PlayStation Network was released as a downloadable PlayStation game on November 22, 2016 in Japan. The game was also re-released in 2018 on the PlayStation Classic. Specifically it is the PAL version which runs slower at 50hz.

=== Cover art ===
The game had different and distinct box art for every release and region. The original release in Japan came with an outer paper box depicting many of the characters in anime, illustrated by Tsukasa Kotobuki who also did the &quot;Toshinden&quot; manga art. The base cover itself had the &quot;Toshinden&quot; logo against a blue background with text in English boasting its &quot;90,000 polygons per second&quot;. On the other hand, the American cover featured Eiji and Mondo in battle, albeit looking significantly different than their actual looks. The PAL version box art was drawn by Paul Kidby and depicts a shield-like symbol with a sword and dragon; Kidby had stated that he was not provided with any screenshots of the actual game. Meanwhile the DOS release depicts Sofia and Duke with their weapons against a dusk city background, and the Game Boy release in all regions is a colorful depiction of all characters deformed and closer to their anime drawings. The Saturn releases (&quot;Toshinden Remix&quot; and &quot;Toshinden S&quot;) also had their own box arts: a large depiction of Eiji above anime figures of other characters in the Japanese release; a sword and burning fire in the North American release; and Eiri, Duke, Rungo and Fo on the PAL cover.

=== Soundtrack ===
Background music was composed by Yasuhiro Nakano and Makoto Mukai. A soundtrack CD featuring arranged versions by the original composers, &quot;Toh Shin Den Retake &amp; Remix&quot;, was released by Sony Records in April 1995. Bach is credited on Sho&#x27;s theme track as it contains a segment from Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The original game&#x27;s music was also re-arranged for the game&#x27;s global PlayStation release in September 1995.

==Reception==
===Sales===
In Japan, &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; sold 696,851 units for the PlayStation. Upon the PlayStation&#x27;s launch in the United States, &quot;Toshinden&quot; sold out in its first week on sale. The game, as well as &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio per hardware system in the United States by the end of 1995. The game went on to sell units for the PlayStation in the United States, including 327,412 standalone copies and 205,312 bundled copies. &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was included in the Greatest Hits range for having sold more than 150,000 units in the United States. The PlayStation version sold a total of units in Japan and the United States.

According to &quot;Next Generation&quot;, the Saturn release had &quot;disappointing sales&quot; in Japan, which they attributed to the strong association of the game with the PlayStation (due to the use of the character Ellis in Japanese ads for the PlayStation) and its weak use of the Saturn hardware when compared to &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;. &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden Remix&quot; for the Saturn sold 84,231 units in Japan, bringing combined sales of the PlayStation and Saturn versions to at least units sold in Japan and the United States.

===Contemporary reviews===
&quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was critically acclaimed when released. &quot;Electric Playground&quot; gave the game a perfect score of 10 out of 10 in 1995. On release, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the PlayStation version of the game a 30 out of 40, and gave it first a 9 out of 10 and later a 10 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. In an early 1995 interview, when asked which PlayStation game he was most impressed with so far, Ken Kutaragi answered &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot;. There was also a positive reception to the game&#x27;s characters and their weapons; in particular, the young character Ellis with her outfit and see-through parts.

&quot;GamePro&quot; reviewed the Japanese version of the game in early 1995 (prior to the PlayStation&#x27;s launch in the U.S.). They remarked that the game is very impressive, and superior to &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; in some aspects, but also flawed in several respects. They particularly praised the texture-mapped polygon graphics, original fighters, myriad moves, unique style of play, and the sidestep move, commenting that &quot;the only problem with this slick defensive move is that from some viewing angles, the fighters obstruct the front of the screen, making it impossible to see where a move is coming from&quot;. Their review of the later U.S. release was also generally positive; they praised the graphics, stage design, playability, and dynamic camera, but criticized the game for being simplistic and easy, remarking that &quot;this game relies more on flash than fighting&quot;. They summarized the game as &quot;an enjoyable fight&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; also reviewed the game prior to the PlayStation&#x27;s U.S. launch. They commented that while the gameplay lacks originality and good reaction speed, the 3D aesthetics and graphics make it a much more powerful experience to play than a typical 2D fighter. However, they concluded that the game loses &quot;by a hair&quot; when compared to its rival, &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;Hyper&quot; magazine rated &quot;Toshinden&quot; higher than &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;.

The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the game a positive review, chiefly praising the character design, graphics, and special moves. &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was awarded Best Fighting Game of 1995 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;.

&quot;Maximum&quot; made note of the graphical and gameplay innovations such as gouraud shading, rotational backgrounds, dramatic camera angles, and the sidestep. They however remarked that the poor quality directional pad on the original PlayStation controller &quot;just isn&#x27;t built for taking diagonals and quarter circle rolls&quot;, making it irritatingly difficult to pull off special moves. Though they assessed the game as good overall, they advised gamers to instead hold out for the PlayStation port of &quot;Tekken&quot;, which they felt to be far superior in every respect. &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

===Ports and retrospective reviews===
Later reviews from 1996 onwards, for later ports as well as retrospective reviews of the PlayStation version, have been generally mixed. In 1996, IGN gave the game a score of 7 out of 10, by which time it was seen as slow and &quot;not as impressive&quot; as the more recent &quot;Tekken 2&quot;, though they praised &quot;Toshinden&quot; for important innovations to the fighting game genre, such as taking &quot;the fighter into true 3-D&quot; and &quot;one little move&quot; that &quot;changed the fighter forever&quot; with the introduction of sidestep movement.

The Sega Saturn version was not as well-received as the PlayStation original. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; complained of the fact that the graphics were not improved from the PlayStation version, and felt that the game was overshadowed by the recent release of &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden 2&quot;. While Rob Allsetter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; greatly praised the visuals of the game and judged the button configuration to be superior to that of the PlayStation version, he criticized the &quot;slow&quot; gameplay and the limited variety of moves, concluding that &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; is &quot;still decent enough, but ... lacks the speed and depth of its more illustrious successors&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that the visuals of the Japanese release were not up to par with those of the PlayStation version, and advised Saturn owners to wait for the U.S. release in hopes that Sega of America would fix the graphical shortcomings. &quot;GamePro&quot;&#x27;s Tommy Glide commented that there is not enough additional content in the Saturn version and the graphics do not look as smooth as the PlayStation version&#x27;s, assessing it as overall &quot;a poor conversion&quot;. &quot;Maximum&quot;″s Rich Leadbetter stated that it fails to recreate the graphical effects of the PlayStation original, which he opined were the only saving grace of an extremely dull game. He held the additional character and the PAL conversion&#x27;s lack of borders to be its only advantages over the PlayStation version.

During the 200th issue leadup of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; in 2005, they ranked &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; as their single most overrated game. They explained that it &quot;was 3D, it was flashy--&quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot; was exciting and new. But later Namco showed us what really could be done with 3D fighting on the PlayStation (&quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Soul Blade&quot;). (...) But is it actually good? Oh God, no&quot;. Following the game&#x27;s release on PlayStation Classic in 2018, Jamie O&#x27;Neill was critical of &quot;slow, unresponsive controls for moves like Special Attacks&quot; and the lack of any story mode, but praised the &quot;energetic&quot; soundtrack and the innovative ability of circling opponents.

==Adaptations and sequels==

From the beginning there was a manga tie-in with characters drawn by Tsukasa Kotobuki, alongside a number of other anthology comics in Japan, including from Hobby Japan, a monthly series by Takeshi Takibayashi on &quot;Monthly Shōnen Ace&quot; (with elements from &quot;Toshinden 2&quot;), another comic published by Softbank Creative, and one by Kozumi Shiita published by Enix.

Drama CDs serving as sequels to the game were released named &quot;Before Stage&quot;, the first volume of which was released in March 1996, using the original Japanese voice cast. This would be followed by an anime OVA adaptation of the same title, released in 1996 and also dubbed in English.

Additionally, shortly after the game release came an official strategy guide published by Tokuma Shoten named &quot;Perfect Fighting Book&quot;. This included a bonus disc for PlayStation, &quot;Toshinden Otanoshimi-Ban&quot; (meaning Toshinden &quot;fun edition&quot;), to watch a round of CPU vs CPU combat and another mode featuring Eiji and Ellis with big heads or in black outfits. The disc can be swapped with the full game to enable the use of them.

=== Series ===
Following the success of &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot;, Takara produced a number of follow-ups (and spin-offs, such as the &quot;chibi&quot; fighter &quot;Nitoshinden&quot;) although with limited success. Later in 1995, &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden 2&quot; was released. Unlike the original, this sequel was originally released on arcades, by Capcom, before consoles, and again had a Sega Saturn specific version, subtitled &quot;U.R.A&quot;. It builds on the original and is often considered to be the series&#x27;s best. This was later followed by &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden 3&quot; in 1996, and &quot;Toshinden 4 (Subaru)&quot; in 1999 which never had an American release.
==== Other games ====
An intended prequel named &quot;Toshinden Next&quot; was given anticipatory promotion in a 1997 issue of the Japanese video game magazine &quot;Dengeki PlayStation&quot;. This game however was not released.

In 1997, Takara released the weapons-based Sega Saturn fighter &quot;D-Xhird&quot;. &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot;&#x27;s protagonist Eiji appears as a secret guest character in this game. In 1998, Takara released the Tamsoft-developed &quot;AbalaBurn&quot; which combined fighting with role-playing adventure.

Later in 2008, a new &quot;Toshinden&quot; action game with eight new characters was unveiled by Takara Tomy in &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot;. It was developed by DreamFactory for the Wii but has no connection to the previous games&#x27; storyline and discards the mainly weapons-based combat found in earlier &quot;Toshinden&quot; games, featuring hand-to-hand combat alongside weapons-based battles. The game was released in Japan on December 10, 2009.

<doc id="954875" wikidata="Q1337514" url="?curid=954875" title="Lincoln LS">
<text>The Lincoln LS is a four-door, five-passenger luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by Ford&#x27;s Lincoln division over a single generation from 1999 until 2006. Introduced in June 1999 for the 2000 model year, the LS featured rear-wheel drive and near 50/50 weight distribution and was available with a V8 or V6, the latter initially offered with a manual transmission. The LS aimed to provide a blend of luxury and sport to attract a new generation of buyers to the Lincoln brand.

The LS shared the Ford DEW98 platform with the Jaguar S-Type and the Ford Thunderbird. Trim levels ranged from the base V6 model to the Special Edition V8 LSE trims in 2004, with revised front and rear fascia, taillights and foglights, and front grille.

LS models were manufactured at Ford&#x27;s Wixom Assembly Plant until production ended on April 3, 2006, and the plant was idled as part of Ford&#x27;s The Way Forward. Approximately 262,900 were manufactured, including 2,331 with manual transmissions and 1,500 LSE editions.

==2000–2002==
In 1999, the LS debuted as Lincoln&#x27;s first rear-wheel drive sport luxury sedan for the 2000 model year, under the influence of the newly established Premier Automotive Group.

Lincoln originally intended to market the sedan in two versions, the LS6 and the LS8, the names reflecting their respective engine layouts. Toyota&#x27;s Lexus division noted concern about the potential name confusion with its Lexus LS full-size luxury sedan, and Lincoln ended up using only the name &quot;LS&quot;. At the same time, Ford threatened a lawsuit regarding the Toyota T150 concept, arguing that the name was too close to that of the F150, so Toyota changed the name of their pickup truck to the Tundra.

In designing the LS to be competitive in its segment, the LS&#x27; German-born chief designer, said of the car, &quot;In a segment defined and dominated by BMW and Mercedes, the car had to have a functional, no-nonsense look. This redefines the Lincoln brand, but we still had to make sure it was recognizable as a member of the same family as the Town Car, Continental, Mark VIII, and the Navigator.&quot; The LS featured understated exterior and interior styling.

Leather seating surfaces were standard, and the steering wheel could be wood or leather-wrapped, with the interior featuring wood accents. Standard features included power windows, power door locks with keyless entry, power heated mirrors, automatic headlights, air conditioning with automatic climate control, cruise control, and an AM/FM cassette radio. Available options included a six-disc in-dash CD changer (only accessible through the glove box initially; changed on later models), a power moonroof, and a universal garage door opener.
The LS shared platforms and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The DEW98 platform used independent double wishbone (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions and a wheelbase. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes were standard. The optional traction control system was marketed as Ford&#x27;s &quot;AdvanceTrac&quot;. Numerous suspension components, as well as the hood, decklid, and front fenders, were aluminum. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels, while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for an extra $1,000 included a stiffer suspension, 17-inch wheels, and manual shift capability for the automatic transmission. The battery of the LS was located in the spare tire well in the car&#x27;s trunk.

The base LS had an all-aluminum 3.0 L DOHC V6 was a variant of the Jaguar AJ-V6 engine. Optional was an all-aluminum 3.9 L DOHC V8, a shorter-stroke variant of the Jaguar 4.0 L AJ-26 V8. Both engines required premium-grade gasoline. Ford&#x27;s 5R55S five-speed automatic transmission with an optional manual shift ability called &quot;SelectShift&quot; was standard with either engine. In contrast, a Getrag 221 five-speed manual transmission was available for V6-equipped LS models when equipped with an optional sport package. Automatic transmission-equipped cars featured a 3.58:1 rear-axle ratio, while manual transmission-equipped versions had a 3.07:1 rear-axle ratio. Lincoln stopped production of the manual-transmission model LS after 2,331 were manufactured. 

The powertrain control module in 2000 through 2002 automatic transmission models with the &quot;SelectShift&quot; option was initially programmed to prevent launching in first gear; i.e., the car would default to a second gear launch. A first-gear launch was available by depressing the throttle by more than 60%. Second-gear launches were programmed to meet EPA fuel economy regulations. For the 2003 model year, first-gear launches were programmed into the transmission, reflecting revised fuel economy regulations.

In 2002, the LSE (Limited Special Edition) package was introduced in V6 and V8 versions, with a revised fascia including round fog lamp openings and a special metallic grille treatment, with enlarged lower body rocker panels, special wheels, and twin dual-exhaust tailpipes. Also for 2002, V6-equipped LS models gained and of torque.

==2003–2006==

The LS received a refresh for 2003, coinciding with Lincoln&#x27;s then-new &quot;Travel Well&quot; ad campaign. The exterior received HID headlamps (optional) and a revised trunk lid with revised taillights. 

Both available engines received a boost in power and torque, as well as slightly improved fuel efficiency. The 3.0 L DOHC V6 with which the LS was introduced now featured continuously variable intake cam timing, improved variable-length intake runners, and electronic &quot;drive-by-wire&quot; throttle control (which replaced the traditional mechanical cable-linked throttle control system used previously). The optional 3.9 L DOHC V8 introduced variable exhaust-valve timing. Due to its upgraded design, the 3.9 L V8 now produced over 87% of its peak torque output at only 2000 rpm, thus cars equipped with the V8 could now accelerate from zero to in around 6.5 seconds. 

Other revisions included an electronic push-button parking brake (similar to that of the BMW E65 7 Series), replacing the center console-mounted hand lever (or foot pedal), a touchscreen DVD satellite navigation map system, and an industry-first, 10-speaker THX-certified sound system. LSE versions were also available in the 2004 and 2005 model years, with unique fascia, unique 17-inch wheels, all-red taillights, a color-keyed grille, unique floormats, and additional wood paneling in the interior.
Early LS models had a mechanical engine cooling fan operated with a hydraulic pump because the electrical charging system had insufficient capacity to power an electric fan effectively. However, a revised alternator enabled the implementation of an electric fan for the 2003 through 2006 models.

The 2003 to 2006 GPS navigation system uses a DVD player mounted in the trunk (under the package tray) to contain the map data.

For 2006, the LS received exterior revision similar to the LSE fascia trim from previous model years. The V6-powered model was dropped from the lineup. The base MSRP increased from $32,370 in 2004 to $39,285. 

==Reception==
The Lincoln LS was named &quot;Motor Trend&#x27;s&quot; Car of the Year for 2000 and was also nominated for the North American Car of the Year award. Road tests by &quot;Motor Trend&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; found that a V8-equipped LS could accelerate from zero to in the low seven-second range, while V6 models were up to two seconds slower in the same test, while driving dynamics were impressive considering that Lincoln&#x27;s other offerings were weak in this regard compared to luxury imports. The LS was touted for its value as a sport sedan since it undercut other mid-size luxury (E-segment / executive car) offerings from German and Japanese marques; the LS V8 was priced similarly to six-cylinder-equipped versions of the BMW 5 Series and Lexus GS. While larger and roomier, the LS was also less refined than its competitors in terms of interior quality and handling. Some reviewers lamented Lincoln&#x27;s choice to discontinue the LS after just one generation rather than release a second generation to keep the LS nameplate competitive.

===Safety===
The Lincoln LS has received very high marks in occupant protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has rated the LS as a &quot;Best Pick&quot; with a perfect score in their frontal offset crash test. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the LS almost perfect scores in its front impact, side-impact and rollover tests. The CNBC rated the LS as “one of the five safest cars of all time.”

<text>The Congested Districts Board for Ireland was established by Arthur Balfour, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, in 1891 to alleviate poverty and living conditions in the west and parts of the northwest of Ireland.

William Lawson Micks worked with the Congested Districts Board (C.D.B.) for the full term of its existence, first as Secretary and from 1909 as a member. The board was dissolved in 1923 by the new Government of the Irish Free State, and its staff absorbed into the Irish Land Commission when its functions were assumed by the Department of Fisheries and Rural Industries.

The C.D.B. was part of the Conservative policy of Constructive Unionism or &#x27;killing Home Rule with kindness&#x27;.
Its purpose was to alleviate poverty by paying for public works, such as building piers for small ports on the west coast, to assist fishing, modernising farming methods or sponsoring local factories to give employment and stop emigration from Ireland – the wider effect would see indigenous (and non-Government funded) initiatives. In the Aran Islands, a knitwear industry was established which to this day provides Aran knitwear on a commercial basis using local skilled knitters and designers. Regions under the Board&#x27;s authority were areas where the rateable valuation was less than 30 shillings. The entire area which was so categorised came to in 1901 with a population of 550,000.

Funds for the C.D.B. came from the Church of Ireland, but by 1912 other funds had been allocated and its assets totalled £530,000 (equivalent to £40 million at 2010 values).

Following the Land Purchase (Ireland) Act 1903, the C.D.B. was authorised to purchase extra land from large estates to enlarge the small holdings of tenants. In 1909, it was granted compulsory powers of purchase and began redistributing over 1,000 estates totalling .

It was acutely criticised by the nationalist Frank Hugh O&#x27;Donnell in 1908. O&#x27;Donnell considered that the C.D.B. was run by local Catholic priests, was not properly supervised by the British Government and was being used to fund church projects such as Industrial schools where the young workers were underpaid. He felt that capital loaned to real businesses would be more effective than advancing the money to parish councils run by priests. He considered that the £100,000 paid to build St Eunan&#x27;s College and the Cathedral of St. Eunan and St Columba in Letterkenny was too great a burden for its 2,000 inhabitants, and found that the C.D.B. head, Bishop O&#x27;Donnell of Raphoe, had indirectly applied grants towards the buildings.

One legacy of the C.D.B. was the Co-Operative movement which was founded by Sir Horace Plunkett who had been shocked by his experiences working as a member of the first Board.

A great achievement for the board was the enlargement and improvement of holdings. This involved the board purchasing land from larger estates and expanding the properties in order to create smaller more efficient holdings. The French estate, near Ballygar in County Galway, was the board&#x27;s first purchase of land. The land cost the board £7,600, by 1919 the board had spent a total of ten million pounds on land. The amelioration of The Dillion Estate in the counties Galway and Roscommon is a great example of the Congested District Boards work. In 1899 the board purchased the Dillion Estate of over 93,652 acres which valued £290,000, the largest price paid by the CDB for any one estate. The majority of the holdings on this estate had poor drainage and poor land which were accustomed to constant flooding. The board solved this issue by investing in large scale drainage operation which also doubled the productive value of hundreds of acres across the estates. They also did work on the roads, fencing and created houses. Baron Ardilaun&#x27;s estate, Lord Bingham&#x27;s estate, the Marquess of Clanricarde&#x27;s estate and Viscount Dillon&#x27;s estate were among the many estates purchased by the C.D.B.

The Congested District Board has had a crucial impact on the fishing industry in the congested districts. The C.D.B spent over £100,000 in construction works, including marine works for example, the building of harbours, piers, roads, bridges and drainage works. This work was undertaken to offer facilities and resources to fishermen, farmers and gardeners. The board worked with the fishing industry providing instruction on barrel making, net making and boat building. The board provided ninety-one decked fishing boats around Ireland and twenty-three of these boats were built on the coast of Connemara and in Killybegs in County Donegal. These boats were valued at £15,000 without any nets or gear 

==Modern assessment==
Irish historian J. J. Lee in his book &quot;The Modernisation of Irish Society&quot; evaluated the Congeseted Districts Board in writing: &quot;The Board&#x27;s promise, in short, generally far exceeded its performance&quot;. He pointed out that the C.D.B. invested heavily in uneconomic projects in the west of Ireland and in County Donegal in the west of Ulster, projects that floundered once they stopped being subsidised. As a result, the flow of emigration from the west and north-west of Ireland was not converted into internal migration to the more developed east, as might have been hoped.

<doc id="954883" wikidata="Q378314" url="?curid=954883" title="A Saintly Switch">
<text>A Saintly Switch is a 1999 American fantasy comedy television film directed by Peter Bogdanovich and written by Haris Orkin, based on a story by Sally Hampton. It stars Vivica A. Fox and David Alan Grier, with Al Waxman, Scott Owen Cumberbatch, Shadia Simmons, David Keeley and Rue McClanahan in supporting roles. The plot revolves around an aging NFL quarterback and his stay-at-home wife switching bodies. The resultant comedy focuses on family values as she has to handle the highly-physical job while he has to handle art classes, bonding with his children, and morning sickness.

The film premiered on ABC on January 24, 1999, as an episode of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

==Plot==
At the film&#x27;s opening, Dan and Sara Anderson are experiencing marital fallout. According to their preteen children, Clark and Annette, they both underestimate each other&#x27;s role in the family. When a new position with the Saints takes them to New Orleans, they purchase a dilapidated mansion. Upon arrival, they start fighting worse than ever. The children go up into the attic and discover a book of spells, finding out from their babysitter, the resident voodoo sorceress, that this house once belonged to the most powerful sorceress in the area. Desperate to save their parents marriage, they cast a spell which inadvertently switches their parents&#x27; bodies.

The next morning, Dan wakes up in Sara&#x27;s body, and she vice versa. They try to act like nothing has changed, which means they must do each other&#x27;s jobs. After managing for about a day or two, still trying to keep the children (who already know what&#x27;s going on) from finding out, Dan (in Sara&#x27;s body) goes to the doctor because he (she) is feeling sick and discovers that he (she) is pregnant. The rest of the movie continues in similar fashion: as they live life in the other&#x27;s body they grow to understand one another.

Thanks to the secret coaching she is receiving from Dan, Sara starts to get better at football. Her nurturing nature leads to her/him implementing the sort of &quot;reward&quot; list and tactics usually expected in a classroom. Surprisingly, this encourages the team so much that they start winning match after match. On the other hand, Dan is learning how to keep house and, though still rather uncomfortable, is rather enjoying his/her pregnancy and getting closer to the children in the process. As time passes, both parents really begin to understand what the other was complaining about, commenting on this to one another and wondering if they&#x27;ll ever switch back or if they&#x27;ll be stuck in each other&#x27;s bodies for the rest of their lives.

When the pregnancy is about nine months along, the Saints come to the final game against the Redskins. If they win, Dan and the team go to the Super Bowl, and Dan would never have to worry about money or moving around again. Exhilarated, he and Sara embrace each other at the table and shout jubilantly at each other. This is heard by the children, who use this opportunity to finally confess all to their parents. They try to undo the spell, but fail. They call the babysitter, who translates that the spell will reverse once its purpose is complete: when their parents truly understand each other, they will be restored to their rightful bodies. However, there is a warning clause that implies that unless they manage to undo the spell before the birth of the baby, it will be permanent.

After the babysitter leaves and the Andersons go to bed, Dan and Sara apologize to each other, then kiss, which turns out to be the necessary act of understanding. The next day is the big match, and Dan&#x27;s teammates instantly notice the difference in his behavior. While Sara goes into labor, his attempts to motivate his teammates with insults causes them to start fumbling. Clark reminds him to forget his old methods of motivation and revert to the &quot;touchy-feely stuff&quot; Sara used. In the hospital, Sara is puffing, panting, swearing, and ordering the nurses to bring her a TV. Around the time Dan wins the championship game, she finally gives in to nature and gives birth to a son. Later on, Dan is offered another job, but turns it down for his family.

==Cast==
==Background==
The film was dedicated to the memory of Dave Waymer by its writer and producer, Sally Hampton, whose experience as an NFL wife (Hampton and Waymer were married in 1981) was the inspiration behind the story. Hampton said she had loosely based the lead characters on their personalities and, ironically, the lead actor, David Alan Grier and Waymer share the same July 1 birthday and Hampton, was born late afternoon of July 29 making her birthday only hours away from the July 30 birthdays of lead actress, Vivica A. Fox and director Peter Bogdanovich. Adding to these coincidences, principal photography of the film began on June 29, 1998, what would have been the 17th wedding anniversary of Hampton&#x27;s marriage to Waymer.

The film was originally titled &quot;In Your Shoes&quot;. Filming took place in Toronto.

==Reception==
Ray Richmond of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review. Whilst noting plot similarities to &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;, as well as character stereotypes, he stated &quot;there is so much to like about the genuinely canny show that all of the other stuff sounds nitpicky and harsh. Under Bogdanovich&#x27;s sure hand, this is a stylish fantasy that leaves you with a smile.&quot;

<text>Marine Parade is a planning area and residential estate located on the eastern fringe of the Central Region of Singapore. Straddling the tip of the southeastern coast of Pulau Ujong, Marine Parade serves as a buffer between the Central and East regions of the country. Bordering it are the planning areas of Geylang to the north, Kallang to the northwest, Bedok to the northeast, Marina East to the southwest and the Singapore Straits to the south. 

Marine Parade is further divided into five subzones, East Coast, Katong, Marine Parade, Marina East (not to be confused with Marina East, the neighbouring planning area) and Mountbatten. 

== Background ==
Marine Parade&#x27;s early history can be associated with the precinct of Katong. Throughout the early to mid 20th century, the area was a haven for the wealthy Peranakan community of Singapore. Katong witnessed a growth in Straits Chinese culture, developing a distinctive architecture style and even becoming the place of origin for the renowned Katong Laksa dish. Marine Parade, as it is known today, mainly consists of HDB (Housing Development Board) flats along the southernmost points of the estate. These were built in the 1970s after the reclamation of the island&#x27;s east coast. Today, many private condominiums are also being built in the area.

==Infrastructure==
The main public housing estate comprises 58 blocks of HDB flats. The public estate is bisected by the arterial Still Road South that provides access to the major highway, East Coast Parkway, leading to the city area and to Singapore Changi Airport.

===Transportation===
Marine Parade is served by two Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations on the Thomson–East Coast line, namely Marine Parade and Marine Terrace.

===Community Building===

The Marine Parade Community Building was completed in 2000. It houses the Marine Parade Community Club and the Marine Parade Public Library. Other facilities within the three-storey complex include a 263-seater theatrette, a glass-walled gymnasium, a covered basketball court on the rooftop, an air-conditioned and a sports hall. The building has since been demolished, and is receiving a major upgrade.

===Town Centre===
Marine Parade, like other towns in Singapore, is served by a town centre. Dubbed Marine Parade Promenade, the centre itself consists of several neighbourhood shops, Parkway Centre and a commercial complex, Parkway Parade, that houses offices and a shopping mall.

==Education==
As Marine Parade is primarily either recreational or residential, it is also a host to a variety of schools.

* Primary Schools
** CHIJ (Katong) Primary 
** Ngee Ann Primary School
** Tao Nan School
** Haig Girls&#x27; School
* Secondary Schools
** CHIJ Katong Convent 
** St. Patrick&#x27;s School 
** Chung Cheng High School (Main) 
** Tanjong Katong Secondary School 
** Tanjong Katong Girls&#x27; School 
* Junior Colleges
** Victoria Junior College

==Politics==
Marine Parade is a component division of the Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency, which also includes the Braddell Heights, Geylang Serai, Kembangan-Chai Chee and Joo Chiat divisions and elects five members to Singapore&#x27;s Parliament. Singapore&#x27;s former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong is the Member of Parliament who represents the Marine Parade division since the formation until his retirement in 2020, where Minister Tan See Leng succeeded Goh as the MP.

<doc id="954888" wikidata="Q327343" url="?curid=954888" title="Irish Brigade (France)">
<text>The Irish Brigade (, ) was a brigade in the French Royal Army composed of Irish exiles, led by Lord Mountcashel. It was formed in May 1690 when five Jacobite regiments were sent from Ireland to France in exchange for a larger force of French infantry who were sent to fight in the Williamite War in Ireland. The regiments comprising the Irish Brigade retained their special status as foreign units in the French Army until nationalised in 1791.

==Formation==
When King James II went to Ireland in March 1689, Ireland was ruled by his viceroy Tyrconnell and was held by the Irish Army, which was loyal to King James. There seemed to be no need for the deployment of French troops in Ireland and Louis XIV needed his troops elsewhere during the Nine Years&#x27; War. When the Irish Army showed its weakness by failing to win the Siege of Derry and losing the minor Battle of Newtownbutler on 31 July 1689, Lauzun was sent to Ireland with a French force of 5000 men but Ireland had to send Irish troops to France in exchange. This was the Irish Brigade, formed in May 1690. It consisted of five regiments, comprising together about 5000 men. The regiments were named after their colonels:
# Lord Mountcashel,
# Butler,
# Feilding,
# O&#x27;Brien, and
# Dillon&#x27;s Regiment, commanded by Arthur Dillon.

The French reformed them and disbanded Butler&#x27;s and Feilding&#x27;s, incorporating their men into the remaining three regiments, which were:
# Mountcashel&#x27;s
# O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s, and
#Dillon&#x27;s

These three regiments formed the first Irish Brigade in France and were known as Lord Mountcashel&#x27;s Irish Brigade and served the French with distinction during the remainder of the Nine Years&#x27; War (1689–97).

Under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick in 1691, which ended the war between King James II and VII and King William III in Ireland, a separate force of 12,000 Jacobites of the Irish Army had arrived in France in an event known as Flight of the Wild Geese. These were kept separate from the Irish Brigade and were formed into King James&#x27;s own army in exile, albeit in the pay of France. Dorrington&#x27;s regiment, later Rooth or Roth, following the Treaty of Ryswick in 1698, was formed from the former 1st and 2nd battalions James II&#x27;s Royal Irish Foot Guards (formerly on the Irish establishment) of Britain.

==Service==
With the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, King James&#x27;s army in exile was disbanded, though many of its officers and men were reformed into new regiments. Having been merged into the original Irish Brigade these units served the French well until the French Revolution. Other Irishmen – such as Peter Lacy – proceeded to enter the Austrian service on an individual basis.

The Irish Brigade became one of the elite units of the French Army. While increasingly diluted by French and foreign recruits from elsewhere in Europe, its Irish-born officers and men often aspired to return to aid Ireland and regain their ancestral lands, as some did during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745.

Irish regiments participated in most of the major land battles fought by the French between 1690 and 1789, particularly Steenkirk (1692), Neerwinden (1693), Marsaglia (1693), Blenheim (1704), Almansa (1707), Malplaquet (1709), Fontenoy (1745), Battle of Lauffeld (1747); and Rossbach (1757).

Units of the Irish Brigade took part in the rising of 1715 and the rising of 1745. For the latter, a composite battalion of infantry (&quot;Irish Picquets&quot;) comprising detachments from each of the regiments of the Irish Brigade, plus one cavalry regiment, Fitzjames&#x27; horse, was sent to Scotland and landed with Richard Warren at Stonehaven in October 1745. This trained and disciplined force saw action at the second Battle of Falkirk (where they cemented the victory by driving off the Hanoverians causing the clans to waver) and Culloden, alongside the regiment of Royal Scots (Royal Ecossais) which had been raised the year before in French service. As serving soldiers of the French King the Irish Picquets were able to formally surrender as a unit after Culloden with a promise of honourable treatment and were not subjected to the reprisals suffered by the Highland clansmen. Many other exiled Jacobites in the French army were captured en route to Scotland in late 1745 and early 1746, including Charles Radcliffe, 5th Earl of Derwentwater, a captain in Dillon&#x27;s regiment who was executed in London in 1746.

In the interim, however, the Brigade found itself briefly opposed to its Spanish counterpart in the War of the Quadruple Alliance in 1718–20, as France was allied to the Jacobites&#x27; Hanoverian rivals. As a result, it was Spain who assisted the Highland Jacobites in their rising that ended in the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719. The 1716 Anglo-French alliance had effectively secured the Hanoverian succession in Ireland and Britain. Despite the alliance France continued to recognize James III as legitimate, and therefore individual Jacobites amongst the Irish regiments in France continued to hope for decades that their cause would eventually succeed. After its early years however the Brigade increasingly became a professional force made up of Irish soldiers who enlisted for reasons of family tradition or in search of opportunities denied them at home, rather than for directly political motives.

Irish regiments served in the War of the Austrian Succession, Seven Years&#x27; War, both in Europe and India, and during the American War of Independence, though by the 1740s the number of Irishmen serving in the regiments had begun to markedly decline. The five regiments were increased to six during the War of the Austrian Succession, the sixth being Lally&#x27;s, initially created by the Comte de Lally -Tollendal through drafts from the original five. Each regiment had a strength of one battalion of 685 men and Fitzjames&#x27;s cavalry regiment counted 240 men. The Brigade played a crucial role at Fontenoy, attacking the right flank of a British column and suffering 656 casualties. O&#x27;Callaghan claims the Irish Brigade captured the colours of the Coldstream Guards during this engagement, as well as fifteen cannon. McGarry, in a recently published book entitled &quot;Irish Brigades Abroad&quot;, disputes this claim. Instead stating the standard in question was the flag of Sempill&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, the forerunner of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. The Irish suffered even higher casualties of around 1400 men, at the Battle of Lauffeld when they led the assault which drove the Pragmatic Army from the village of Lauffeld and secured victory. During the Seven Years&#x27; War the Irish Regiments in French service were: Bulkeley, Clare, Dillon, Rooth, Berwick and Lally as well as one regiment of cavalry (Fitzjames&#x27;s).

From January 1766 the Papacy formally recognised George III of the Hanoverian dynasty as the lawful monarch of Britain and Ireland, and refused to recognise Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was now styled as King Charles III by the Jacobites. The rise of George III also saw the Tories come back to power with John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute forming a ministry – the Tories had previously included high-placed, financially powerful Jacobites. There were always a number of English and Scots serving in the Brigade, though their numbers fluctuated markedly over the years. A database being compiled by the Centre for Irish-Scottish Studies at Trinity College suggests that for every ten Irishmen, there were on average two Englishmen and one Scot.

During the American War of Independence, the brigade participated in the Capture of Grenada, the Siege of Savannah, the Invasion of Tobago, the Capture of Sint Eustatius, and the Siege of Brimstone Hill. Walsh&#x27;s regiment is noted for aiding the American cause in the American Revolution, when a detachment was assigned as marines to John Paul Jones&#x27; ship, the &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot;. 
Lt. Edward Stack commanded the division in the main top of the Bonhomme Richard during her battle with HMS Serapis. The USS Stack is named for him. Their involvement and use of the motto &quot;&quot;Semper et Ubique Fidelis&quot;&quot; may have influenced the subsequent adoption of the motto &quot;Semper Fidelis&quot; by the U.S. Marines.

==Recruitment==
Until the Seven Years&#x27; War the British authorities had turned a blind eye to semi-organised recruitment within Ireland itself for the regiments of the Brigade. As long as the Irish troops were not employed against Britain or its allies, this was seen as a useful way of removing potentially discontented men of military age. In 1729 a confidential treaty between the French and British governments made provision for the engagement of 750 Irish recruits provided that this activity remained unpublicized. After the employment of the Irish Picquets (an ad hoc force made up of detachments from each regiment of the Irish Brigade) in support of the Jacobite rising in Scotland showed the danger of such a policy, measures were taken to reduce the flow of Irish recruits to French service. Individual recruiters for the Irish Brigade were hanged if caught and during the Seven Years&#x27; War all British subjects in French service were declared traitors by Parliament and liable to execution if taken prisoner. This draconian measure does not, however, appear to have been implemented, except where individual prisoners of war were identified as having first deserted from the British Army. 
By the eve of the French Revolution in 1789 direct Irish recruitment into the Irish Brigade had diminished to a limited number having the motive and opportunity to make their own way to France. Irishmen serving in the British Army and taken prisoner during the French wars might find themselves being encouraged to literally change their coats and enlist in the Brigade. The shortfall in numbers was made up by the increasing substitution of German, Swiss and other foreigners, plus some Frenchmen. The officers, however, were mainly drawn from Franco-Irish families which might have existed for several generations since their founders had migrated to France. Distinguished military service led to such families being accepted into the French aristocracy while retaining their Irish names and consciousness of origin.

==Uniforms and flags==
The Irish Brigade wore red coats throughout the eighteenth century with different facing colours to distinguish each regiment. It has been suggested that the red coat was an expression of their loyalty to the Stuart claimants to the throne of Britain and Ireland. However, uniforms of this colour were widely worn by foreign regiments in the French service, notably those recruited in Switzerland. The use of Saint George&#x27;s Cross on all the Brigade&#x27;s flags reflected their acceptance of the central importance of James III&#x27;s claim to the Crown of England.

Details of each individual regiment were:
* Buckeley Infanterie. Red coat, collar and lining, dark green cuffs and waistcoat with white (i.e. pewter) buttons. 
* Clare Infanterie. Red coat and waistcoat, yellow facings, white buttons. 
* Dillon Infanterie. Red coat and waistcoat, no collar, black cuffs yellow (i.e. bronze buttons. 
* Roth Infanterie. Red coat, no collar. Blue cuffs, lining, waistcoat and breeches, yellow buttons. 
* Berwick Infanterie. Red coat and waistcoat, black collar and cuffs, white lining, double vertical pocket flaps, yellow buttons, six on each pocket flap. 
* Lally Infanterie. Red coat, bright green collar, cuffs and waistcoat, yellow buttons. 
The 1791 provisional regulations, on the eve of the disestablishment of the Irish Brigade, gave black facings to all four regiments with only minor distinctions to distinguish each unit.

Most of their Colours were representative of their British Jacobite origins, with every regimental colour carrying the cross of St George and the four crowns of England, Ireland, Scotland and France. Nearly all the regiments&#x27; flags carried a crown over an Irish harp in the centre, one exception being Roth&#x27;s regiment of former Foot Guards, whose official title in the 1690s was the King of England&#x27;s Foot Guards; their flag was a red cross of St George with a crown in the centre surmounted by a crowned lion. They carried the motto In Hoc Signo Vinces. Another was the Earl of Clancarty&#x27;s, whose flag became that of the Duke of Berwick&#x27;s regiment when the latter was founded in 1698 following the abolition and merger of Clancarty&#x27;s and several other regiments to form Berwick&#x27;s, later, in 1743, Fitzjames&#x27;s infantry. A correct representation of the flag carried by Berwick&#x27;s regiment can be seen by following the link below to the Flags of the French army. Fitzjames&#x27;s cavalry regiment standard had a French design of a yellow field with a central radiant sun surmounted by a ribbon with the motto: &quot;Nec Pluribus Impar&quot;, [Not Unequal to Many].

==Language==
Some officers of the Irish Brigade are believed to have cried out &quot;Cuimhnígí ar Luimneach agus ar fheall na Sasanach!&quot; (&quot;Remember Limerick and Saxon perfidy&quot;) at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745. Modern research by Eoghan Ó hAnnracháin claims that it is very doubtful if the regiments would also have been chanting in Irish, a language unknown to probably a majority of the brigade at the time. Others strongly dispute this, as over the course of 100 years new recruits were brought into the brigade mostly from the Irish-speaking regions of West Munster, the homeland of, among others the O&#x27;Connell family of Derrynane House. Stephen McGarry also makes the point in his book &quot;Irish Brigades Abroad&quot; that Irish was widely spoken in the Irish regiments of France. Daniel Charles O&#x27;Connell was the uncle of &quot;The Liberator&quot; Daniel O&#x27;Connell and was the last Colonel of the French Irish Brigade in 1794 and rose to general rank. The O&#x27;Connells were native Munster Irish speakers and members of the dispossessed Gaelic nobility of Ireland. According to official French Royal Army regulations, officers of the Irish Brigade regiments had to be Irish, half of whom had to be born in Ireland and the other half born of Irish descent in France. In practice by the outbreak of the French Revolution most serving officers of the Brigade fell into the second category.

Seamus MacManus shows in his book &quot;The Story of The Irish Race&quot; (1921): &quot;In truth, it was not the &quot;Wild Geese&quot; who forgot the tongue of the Gael or let it perish. We are told that the watchwords and the words of command in the &quot;Brigade&quot; were always in Irish and that officers who did not know the language before they entered the service found themselves of necessity compelled to learn it.&quot;

==End of the Irish Brigade==
The Brigade ceased to exist as a separate and distinct entity on 21 July 1791. Along with the other non-Swiss foreign units, the Irish regiments underwent &quot;nationalization&quot; at the orders of the National Assembly. This involved their being assimilated into the regular French Army as line infantry; losing their traditional titles, practices, regulations and uniforms. The initial (early 1791) restructuring of the army had already seen the Dillon Regiment become the &quot;87e&quot; Regiment, Berwick the &quot;88e&quot;, and Walsh the &quot;92e&quot;. The 92nd Infantry Regiment remains in active service the French Army today, having seen action in the Napoleonic Wars, the Franco-Prussian War, and both the World Wars.

The members of the Irish Brigade had historically sworn loyalty to the King of France, not to the French people or their new republic of 1792. In 1792 some elements of the Brigade, who had rallied to the émigré Royalist forces, were presented with a &quot;farewell banner&quot; bearing the device of an Irish Harp embroidered with shamrocks and fleurs-de-lis.

Of the two senior Dillon officers who remained in the French Revolutionary Army, Theobald was killed by his soldiers when in retreat in 1792 and Arthur was executed in 1794 during The Terror. In 1793 the former Dillon Regiment was split into the 157th and 158th Line regiments. By 1794 some officers felt that the Government of the French First Republic had become too anti-Catholic, and joined the Catholic Irish Brigade organized by William Pitt the Younger. In 1803, the Irish Legion was formed by Napoleon Bonaparte for Irishmen willing to take part in his planned invasion of Ireland.

==Literature==

Stephen McGarry&#x27;s &quot;Irish Brigades Abroad&quot; (Dublin, 2013 Kindle edition, paperback May 2014) is a new book on the subject and finally updates John Cornelius O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s &quot;History of the Irish Brigades in the Service of France&quot; (London, 1870). Mark McLaughlin&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, (London, 1980) was published by Osprey as part of their Men-at-Arms series and provides an introduction to the subject.

<doc id="954897" wikidata="Q1201898" url="?curid=954897" title="Black Widow (Chechnya)">
<text>Black Widow (, &quot;chyornaya vdova&quot;) or Shahidka (—Russian feminine gender derivation from &quot;shahid&quot;), is a term for Islamist Chechen female suicide bombers, willing to be a manifestation of violent jihad. They became known at the Moscow theater hostage crisis of October 2002. The commander Shamil Basayev referred to the shahidkas as a part of force of his suicide bombers called the Riyad-us Saliheen Brigade of Martyrs. Basayev also stated that he himself trained at least fifty of the Black Widows. The female suicide bombers have carried out over 65% of the 23 terrorist attacks linked to the Chechen movement since 2000. The Black Widows are associated with terrorist attacks in Chechnya between 1999 and 2005.

The term &quot;Black Widows&quot; probably originates from these women being widows of men killed by the Russian forces in Chechnya (the connotation of black widow spider is intended). The Black Widows wear black dresses and dark clothing that covers their bodies from head to toe. This attire is supposed to symbolize their personal losses from the Chechen wars. In 2003, the Russian journalist Yulia Yuzik coined the phrase &quot;Brides of Allah&quot; (Невесты Аллаха) when she described the process by which Chechen women were recruited by Basayev and his associates; the phrase was also used again after the Beslan attack, as the title of an installment of the Russian NTV programme &quot;Top Secret&quot; (Совершенно секретно).

==Background==
To terrorists, Black Widows are considered less valuable than male terrorists, since male terrorists require formal training, while women terrorists are viewed as expendable. In some cases, when opinions do not match between Black Widows and male terrorists, male terrorists detonate bombs strapped onto Black Widows to get rid of them. Additionally, women terrorists are strategically appealing because they symbolize opposing their traditional roles of being obedient, also women terrorists arouse less suspicion, which terrorists groups are able to take advantages of. Between 1998 and 2001, according to professor Richard Pape of University of Chicago, the average number of deaths caused by a suicide attack is 13 people, while the average deaths caused by suicide attacks from Black Widows is 28, meaning they are twice more deadly than the average suicide bomber.

There are currently forty-seven Chechen Female bombers that have been confirmed based on twenty five successful bombings. These attacks methods include detonating bombs on trucks, cars, usage of explosive devices, or using suicide belts or bags. Some have even detonated their bombs on airplanes.

According to Marc Sagement, who takes part in the Foreign Policy Research Institute&#x27;s Center for the Study of Terrorism, there is a strong relationship between becoming a Black Widow and having personal connections to terror networks. In other words, recruitment of Black Widows usually occurs through friendships or familial relationships. Approximately, twenty seven percent of Black Widows were married or had personal connections to terrorists before becoming terrorists themselves. Further, Black Widows had similar prior experiences before becoming terrorists. These prior experiences include losing close family members that resulted from conflicts with the Russian forces.

Although Chechen suicide bombers do not have personality disorders prior to becoming terrorists, research shows that they have deep personal trauma, which leads them to embrace terrorist ideologies causing them to join the Black Widows. Furthermore, Chechens believe it is ethically correct to take revenge if one&#x27;s loved one has died. Another perspective of how Black Widows form is that after traumatic events, people in general, not just Chechen women, tend to turn to extreme religious views to form a sense of identity and belonging. Thus, jihadist ideologies provides this medium for Chechen women who experienced extreme post traumatic experiences thus transforming them into Black Widows. Combined with personal trauma, cultural responsibility for social justice, and extreme religious viewpoints to take revenge, these factors mold Chechen women to become Black Widows.

== Motives ==

There have been claims by Yulia Yuzik, a Russian journalist and author of &quot;Brides of Allah,&quot; that many of the women who have been sold by their parents are used as shahidkas, while others have been kidnapped or tricked. She also claims that many have been prepared to be suicide bombers through narcotics and rape. Several were pregnant at the time. Besayev, who is a leader of the Chechen independence movement and a terrorist, also argued that women are trained for their missions. In addition, Michael Radu argued that these women are specifically trained for suicide attacks. On the other hand, independent journalists including Robert W. Kurz and Charles K. Bartles reject this view, stating that in most cases female Chechen suicide bombers do not fit this model. Mostly, female terrorists are given no training at all in preparation for the suicides as no weapon skill is needed to strap on the explosives. Many do not even blow themselves up, but are blown up by remote controls.

Additionally, some Black Widows have brothers or close relatives who were killed in one of the two Chechen wars between Russia and Islamist rebels since 1994 or in clashes with Russian-backed forces. These women may be driven by grievances or they may feel it is the only option to get their viewpoint seen. Kurz and Bartles offer another view of Black Widows&#x27; motives, arguing that these women are much more motivated by revenge, despair, and their drive for an independent state than by religious fundamentalism or individual honor. They may feel that terrorism is a strategy when there is no peaceful outlet to affect politics or that it is the only option for people with extremist views. Black Widows may be driven by the idea of Chechnya gaining independence from Russia or they may have joined the terrorist movement because they were brainwashed and needed a sense of belonging when they were in a state of political turmoil. It is important to note that the Black Widows rarely do interviews, so very little is known about their lives.

After the Dubrovka theater attack, hostages gave mixed reports about what motivates the Black Widows. During the attack, some female suicide bombers reportedly told hostages how their family members had been killed in the war and they felt they had nothing left, thus, they were motivated by family connections. Other hostages reported that some of the Black Widows only talked about the Koran, had extremist viewpoints, and were hard to reason with. A majority of Black Widows are uneducated which may be the result of these extreme perspectives. This also suggests that Black Widows may be driven by ideals about religion or may be out of touch with reality, and brainwashed by the men in their lives to join the cause.

== Media depictions ==
The media depicts the female suicide bombers in two main ways, as motivated by the deaths of men in her life or as in a situation of hopelessness where she is forced into terrorism to get her voice heard. Both the Russian government and Chechen groups portrayed the Black Widows in these ways to support their respective positions. Chechen terrorist leaders emphasized women as victims to humanize the Russian-Chechen Conflict. Media coverage tends to show the female terrorists motives as emotional, such as due to loss of a relative, rather than ideological or political, such as gaining independence from Russia. The New York Times reported on Chechnya and Russia between 1994 and 2004 during the peak of the conflict; its reports often questioned and speculated why women would join the Chechen terrorist groups and largely did not interview the Chechen&#x27;s involved in the cause. A common media narrative about the Chechen Black Widows is that they joined due to family connections; because they were following men or avenging the deaths of their husbands. Women may also be portrayed as being a terrorist for &#x27;the sake of love&#x27;; meaning they join because they have a personal connection to the organization, such as a husband or a boyfriend in the organization. This narrative describes the female terrorists as feminine and passive because they are following the men in their lives to join the terrorist organization. On the other hand, women may also be depicted as tough as a man and given more masculine qualities; and the media may question her feminine qualities.

In 1994, the Russian press began to note rumors of female suicide bombers and female snipers; these rumors were proven credible due to the occasional arrests and the known involvement of women in the attacks during the Russian-Chechen Conflict. On November 29, 2001, journalists reported the attempted assassination of General Gadzhiyez by a suicide bomber attack This attack received relatively little attention from the western press, but may have been the first Black Widow attack. On October 23, 2002, the female terrorists gained international media attention when they seized the Dubrovka Theater. During this attack, female terrorists were filmed and interviewed by the press. This is one of the first times the Black Widows had a voice in the media.

==Notable attacks==
* The main perpetrator Khava Barayeva is considered first known ‘Black Widow’. She is the cousin of the well-known field commander warlord Arbi Barayev and sister of Movsar Barayev, head of the moscow commando. She and Luisa Magomadova were the first to attack and became known as the “Black Widows”. Before her attack Khava Barayeva made a martyr video. In the video, Khava Barayeva claimed she was attacking for Chechen independence and tried to spread the message to others to do the same. On June 6, 2000, Khava Barayeva, who was only 17 years old, and Luisa Magomadova drove a truck of explosives at a checkpoint of Omon, a base named Alkhan-Yurt. Barayeva detonated the bombs, which is reported according to the rebels 27 people had passed, while Russians claimed two people were killed and only five people were injured.
* Medna Bayrokova, a resident of Grozny, said that she remembers the day a middle aged woman came to her front door asking to speak to her 26-year-old daughter, Zareta Bayrokova, who was a tuberculosis patient. Bayrokova let the woman in. Her daughter spent an hour in her bedroom with the woman, before leaving the house. Zareta Bayrokova died in the attack on the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow in 2002. Of the 41 terrorists in the attack on the Dubrovka theater 19 were female. The terrorists held around 800 people hostage at the theater for 3 days, until Russian forces regained control of the building.
* In May 2003, Shakhida Baimuratova, a suicide bomber, killed 16 people and wounded 150 in an assassination attempt on then Moscow-appointed Chechen president Akhmad Kadyrov at a crowded Muslim festival in Ilishkan Yurt. A second woman bomber was also present but killed only herself.
* On 5 June 2003, a woman detonated a bomb in a bus carrying Russian Air Force pilots in North Ossetia, killing twenty (besides herself) and injuring 14.
* On 5 July 2003, two suicide bombers killed 16 people and injured six others at a rock concert at Tushino Airfield in Moscow.
* In December 2003, a male and female suicide bomber killed 46 people and injured 100 others by detonating explosives on a packed commuter train, which had just left Yessentuki in Southern Russia. The woman is believed to have carried explosives in a bag, whereas the man had grenades strapped to his leg.
* On 9 December 2003, a bomb exploded outside the Hotel National, Moscow just a few hundred metres from the Moscow Kremlin. It is thought that the target was the State Duma building and that the bomb had detonated prematurely. Six people died and 13 were injured in the blast. The suicide bomber was later identified as Khadishat Mangeriyeva.
* On 6 February 2004, Georgi Trofimov, a Russian bomb disposal officer, was killed as he tried to defuse a device at a Moscow cafe. The failed bomber, ethnic Ingush Zarema Muzhakhoyeva, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for terrorism in April 2004. In 2005, she participated in the trial of the Beslan hostage crisis terrorist Nur-Pashi Kulayev as a witness for the prosecution, but she withdrew all her statements about Kulayev that she made in pre-trial depositions and said she didn&#x27;t know he was a militant.
* Two Russian passenger aircraft disasters in 2004 are believed to have been the work of the Black Widows. The smaller of the planes, a TU-134 which crashed near Tula, had been carrying a Chechen woman called Amanat Nagayeva who had bought her ticket just an hour before the flight took off. The larger plane exploded near the city of Rostov killing 46 people. Among the wreckage, investigators found traces of hexogen, a powerful explosive. Another Chechen woman, Satsita Djerbikhanova, was also a last-minute passenger on this flight.
* The Beslan School Siege started on Wednesday, September 1, 2004, during the day of knowledge, which is a holiday that celebrates school starting. Because of this holiday, there were many children including parents in a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. At 9:30 AM, 34 terrorists stormed the school, including two female suicide bombers, taking more than one thousand hostages. On the first day, all of the hostages were taken to the school&#x27;s gym. There were more than a thousand hostages including parents, children, and teachers. The attackers then separated the adults that seemed the strongest, about fifteen to twenty people, into a corridor, where explosions occurred shortly after. The explosions were the result of the female suicide bombers. Negotiations started with the terrorists and with an individual named Leonid Rosha, a pediatrician. Ultimately, negotiations failed. On the second day, Russia&#x27;s president, Vladimir Putin made the public statement that, what is most important is the life of the hostages. Negotiations kept occurring, but none of them seemed successful. On the last day of the siege, two bombs detonated killing many hostages instantly, however, some of the hostages took this chance to flee. Russian forces also took this chance to move in into the school. In the process of all of this, the roof collapsed killing more than a hundred hostages. In the end, some of the terrorists were killed and some were captured alive. Because of this incident, more than 330 people were killed and about 700 people were wounded. Two Chechen women suicide bombers, Roza Nagayeva and Mairam Taburova, were involved.
* On 29 March 2010, nearly 40 people were killed and another 100 injured when two suicide bombers detonated explosives at two stations of the Moscow subway, the Park Kultury metro station and at the Lubyanka station. The attacks were linked to shahidkas by the Russian Government, although an investigation has yet to be undertaken. One of the perpetrators was Dagestani-born Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova (1992–2010), the widow of 30-year-old Umalat Magomedov who was killed by Russian forces on 31 December 2009.
* On 24 January 2011, 35 were killed and 180 wounded in Domodedovo, Russia&#x27;s busiest airport. Although the identity of those responsible for carrying out the attacks has not been officially confirmed, initial reports suggested that at least one Black Widow was involved, likely accompanied by a man.
* On 7 March 2012, a widow of a militant killed on 10–11 February 2012 near a village, Karabudakhkent, 40 km (24 miles) south of Dagestan capital Makhachkala, killed herself and five police officers and wounded two others in Karabudakhkent.
* On 28 August 2012, Sufi leader Said Afandi and six other people were killed in a suicide bomb attack in Dagestan. The attack was allegedly perpetrated by Russian Aminat Kurbanova who had converted to Islam. Her two former spouses were Islamic militants, and her third husband also believed to be a militant.
*On 25 May 2013, a female suicide bomber, Madina Alieva, blew herself up in Dagestan, injuring at least 18. She was the widow of an Islamist killed in 2009.
*On 21 October 2013, a female suicide bomber, Naida Asiyalova, blew up a Volgograd bus, killing six of the forty passengers.
*On 29 December 2013, a female suicide bomber killed 16 people at a train station in Volgograd.

<text>John Anthony Curry, (9 September 1949 – 15 April 1994) was a British figure skater. He was the 1976 European, World and Olympic Champion. He was noted for combining ballet and modern dance influences into his skating.

==Early life==
Curry was born on 9 September 1949 in Birmingham, England. He had two older brothers. He was educated at Solihull School, a private school in the West Midlands and prior to this, at St Andrews, an independent boarding school in Somerset. As a child, Curry wanted to become a dancer, but his father disapproved of dance as an activity for boys. As a compromise, in 1957, he began to take figure skating lessons under the guidance of Ken Vickers at the Summerhill Road rink in Birmingham.

==Skating career==
After his father died from suicide when John was 16, he moved to London to study with Arnold Gerschwiler, who coached him to his first British title in 1971. In 1972, Curry found an American sponsor who enabled him to study in the United States with Gus Lussi and Carlo Fassi. At the age of 18, he added ballet lessons to his training.

===Competitive career===
Fassi coached Curry to European, World, and Olympic titles in 1976. He also won the British championships that year, giving him the coveted Grand Slam in figure skating with his four major titles in 1976. In the same year he was the flag bearer at the Winter Olympics for Great Britain and was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1976. He was the first male figure skater from Great Britain to win Olympic gold.

As an amateur competitor, Curry was noted for his ballet-like posture and extension, and his superb body control. Along with Canadian skater Toller Cranston, Curry was responsible for bringing the artistic and presentation aspects of men&#x27;s figure skating to a new level. At the peak of his competitive career, Curry was also accomplished both at compulsory figures and the athletic (jumping) aspects of free skating.

During his 1976 Olympic free skate, using music from the ballet &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, he successfully landed a triple toe loop, a triple Salchow and a triple loop jump. His performance is known to have garnered the highest score ever given during the era of the 6.0 scoring in figure skating. He earned 105.9 points out of a possible 108 points from a panel of 9 international judges. Only the judges from Canada and the Soviet Union did not place him first. The judges&#x27; decisions are noteworthy because the silver medallist was Vladimir Kovalev of USSR and the bronze medallist was Toller Cranston of Canada. The programme, with its formal ballet positions and &quot;measured restraint&quot;, was also known as one of Curry&#x27;s most memorable performances. Two years earlier, he used &quot;Rite of Spring&quot; by Stravinsky, which was called &quot;a new, more eccentric look to his skating&quot;.

His skating was unusual in that his jumps were performed counter-clockwise, but most of his spins (except flying spins) were performed clockwise. In his 1978 biography, Curry is clear that if he were to do it over, his choice would have been in favour of ballet due to its highly defined structure which was a basis for his ability to jump and spin in either direction thanks to his command of a true center line understanding.

Curry&#x27;s skating was characterized by strict attention to detail and clean, classical lines. As figure skater and writer Ellyn Kestnbaum states, he used his training in ballet to portray integrity of movement rooted in both dance and skating techniques.

===Professional career===
Following the 1976 World Championships, Curry turned professional and founded a touring skating company along the same lines as a traditional dance company. Besides choreographing routines for the company, Curry commissioned works from such noted dance choreographers as Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Peter Martins and Twyla Tharp. Curry was reportedly a difficult person to get along with, and a dispute with the business managers of his company forced it to suspend operations in the mid-1980s.

Curry&#x27;s Broadway theatre credits include &quot;Icedancing&quot; (1978) as a performer and director and the 1980 revival of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; as an actor and the Roundabout Theatre 1989 revival of &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; as an actor.

==Personal life==
It is speculated that Curry was outed as gay by a German tabloid newspaper, &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;. before the March 1976 World Championships. He was competing in Gothenburg as Britain&#x27;s (and the world&#x27;s) first openly gay high-profile sportsperson. The revelation had occurred in February 1976, when John Vinocur, a reporter from the Associated Press, interviewed him in the days prior to his Olympic victory. His report, which included quotes from Curry that were candid about his sexuality, was published 24 hours after the victory made headline news. Curry confirmed he was gay at a press conference in Innsbruck the same evening. It caused a brief scandal in Europe at the time, but Curry&#x27;s sexual orientation was generally ignored by the press and public for many years afterwards.

In 1987, Curry was diagnosed with HIV and, in 1991, with AIDS. In October 1992, he gave an interview to a newspaper in which he spoke about both his disease and his sexual orientation. He spent the last years of his life with his mother. He died of an AIDS-related heart attack on 15 April 1994 in Binton, Warwickshire, aged 44. In line with his own wishes, Curry had a humanist funeral. A humanist memorial service took place later that year at Conway Hall Ethical Society, London.

Donald Spoto&#x27;s authorised biography of actor Alan Bates stated that Curry and Bates had a two-year affair and that Curry died in Bates&#x27;s arms.

In 2018, a documentary on Curry&#x27;s life and career, &quot;The Ice King&quot;, was released by Dogwoof Pictures.

<text>Cerro Azul (&quot;Blue Hill&quot;) is a fishing village and formerly a commercial port in the Cañete Province, Lima Region, Peru. Located 131 km south of Lima, it is frequently visited in the summer by its residents, and those of San Vicente de Cañete. The village has come to depend more heavily on tourism than on fishing. It was quite considerably damaged in the 2007 earthquake that shook much of the southern coast of Peru.

The beach forms an attractive bay that ends in a rocky point where the waves it is famous for break. These break from left to right, are well shaped and go for about half a mile on a good day. The renowned quality of its waves is mentioned in the Beach Boys&#x27; song &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot;. However, the quality of the waves changes seasonally and from year to year, as the sand and stones that make up the beach are chronically withdrawn by the sea to form a bank where the waves break.

South of the pier is the area known as Puerto Viejo (&quot;old port&quot; ), where all the holiday homes are and where most of the surfing takes place (left breaks). To the north of the pier, the beach is much longer, less curved and much sandier. There are no holiday homes on it and in the winter is empty. During the summer, it is popular with campers and day-trippers. It is possible to surf here too, when the swell is high, particularly adjacent to the pier, where the waves are fast and the rides tend to be short. .

Cerro Azul&#x27;s main feature is the pier which was built by a British company around 1900 for the export of locally grown cotton. The pier has been disused for over 60 years and is now frequented by fishermen and tourists and is one of the main tourists attractions.

The village also has an attractive main square and the remains of Pre-Inca mud buildings, half buried by sand between two hills which are made from the blue rock that gives the village its name. The other hill features a derelict lighthouse from the days when the area functioned as a port. It sits above craggy, vertical, dangerous cliffs, where birds in the area make their nests. Of note is the Inca tern, a bird endemic to the Humboldt Current, which sweeps the Peruvian coast. Other wildlife of note commonly seen in the area: porpoises, pelicans, sea lions, herons and, on rare occasions, sharks. The village prides itself in catching the largest shark in Peruvian history (in 1989), a 5m long great white. Behind the village, across the Pan-American Highway, are fields and winding valleys in the foothills of the Andes.

== History ==

In pre-Columbian times, Cerro Azul was the site of a fishing village of the Kingdom of Warku. Warku was contemporaneous with the Chimú culture to the north. The Kingdom of Warku was hierarchical; at Cerro Azul elites lived in large compounds while commoners lived in smaller structures. All residences at Cerro Azul included rooms for drying fish. The dried fish could later be traded for goods from outside the village. Elite residences included a brewery that contained large hearths and gigantic vessels to store the chicha (corn beer) that could be served during feasts.

The town was subdued by the Inca Pachacutec who ordered to build a stone fortress (Fortaleza de Cerro Azul), with steps down to the sea in honor of his victory and a symbol of his absolute power. This fort was as grand and magnificent as the Sacsayhuaman fortress according to Cieza and some historians.

In 1830 it is issued a decree which temporarily enables the Port of Cerro Azul for the coasting trade, i.e. to allow landlocked products in the valley of Cañete, as well as the production of the guano islands nearby.

<text>Crossing Delancey is a 1988 American romantic comedy film adapted by Susan Sandler from her play of the same name, and directed by Joan Micklin Silver. It stars Amy Irving and Peter Riegert. The film also features performances from Reizl Bozyk, David Hyde-Pierce, Sylvia Miles and Rosemary Harris. Amy Irving was nominated for a Golden Globe for the film, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical.

==Plot==
Isabelle Grossman works for a New York bookstore, where she mingles with the city&#x27;s literati, whom she idolizes. But outside of work she is lonely and unfulfilled, settling for an occasional night of romance with a married man. When Dutch-American author Anton Maes comes to the bookstore to give a reading, he shows an interest in Isabelle, who is charmed.

Isabelle pays frequent visits to her Yiddish-speaking &quot;Bubbe&quot; (grandmother), Ida, who lives in an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Anxious for her granddaughter to settle down with a decent Orthodox man, Ida hires a marriage broker. Although enraged, Isabelle grudgingly allows the matchmaker to introduce her in Bubbe’s kitchen to Sam Posner.

At first Isabelle is dismissive of Sam, believing that the small business he owns, a street corner pickle stand, is too working class to provide the life she wants. Instead, she sets her sights on Anton and the New York City intelligentsia, but she also feels guilty for how rude she was to Sam. She tries to make it up to him by setting him up with her girlfriend Marilyn. In the process, though, she learns that Sam kept turning down the matchmaker because he was waiting for her to bring a photo of Isabelle; Sam has quietly had a crush on Isabelle from afar for many years. She is deeply touched, through her friends see Sam has given up on her and starts dating Marilyn.

One day at a store book reading, Sam shows up invited by Isabelle, as does Anton. Isabelle leaves with Sam, and later agrees to meet him the next day at her Bubbe’s apartment to go on a date.

After work the next day, however, she is sidelined by Anton and, believing that he is romantically interested in her, goes to his apartment. She discovers instead that the narcissistic Anton wants an assistant he can sleep with, not a real wife or girlfriend. A disgusted Isabelle rejects him and races to her grandmother&#x27;s apartment, finding it empty with Ida sleeping on the couch. Heartbroken, she believes she has ruined her chances with the honest and caring Sam. As she cries, Sam enters from the balcony. The two finally are united and Ida, waking and having feigned senile dementia to keep Sam from leaving, laughs gleefully that her plan has succeeded.

==Cast==
This was Yiddish theatre star Reizl Bozyk’s only film role.

<text>Gary Lynn Nolan (born May 27, 1948) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won four National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1970 and 1976. He played his final season with the California Angels. In 1983, Nolan was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Nolan was born in Herlong, California, and his family then moved to Oroville, California, when he was young. In February 1965 at age 17 he married high school sweetheart Carole Widener. He graduated from Oroville High School in 1966. Nolan was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round (13th pick overall) of the 1966 Major League Baseball Draft.

==Major League career==
Nolan&#x27;s first Major League game was at the young age of 18. A hard thrower, Nolan had a promising debut on April 15, 1967, when he struck out the side in the first inning en route to a 7–3 victory over the Houston Astros. On June 7, he struck out future Baseball Hall of Famer Willie Mays four times in one game. He had fifteen strikeouts in the game but was pulled in the eighth after giving up a three-run home run that tied it to Willie McCovey; the Giants won 4-3. &quot;The kid was good,&quot; Mays said. He finished with a 14–8 record in that rookie season, was fourth in the National League in ERA (2.58) and in strikeouts (206), and was third in the Rookie of the Year voting behind Tom Seaver of the Mets, and Dick Hughes of the Cardinals.

In 1970 Nolan went 18–7 with 181 strikeouts and a 3.26 ERA, helping the Reds to win the NL pennant and establishing himself as one of the league&#x27;s great young starting pitchers. Nolan pitched a remarkable nine innings of shutout ball to earn a victory in the 10-inning Game One of that year&#x27;s National League Championship Series against Pittsburgh. But he took the loss in Game One of the World Series against the eventual champion Baltimore Orioles.

After a disappointing 12–15 record in 1971, he posted 13 victories before the 1972 All-Star Game. Selected for the NL team, Nolan was suffering from neck and shoulder pains, and he was forced to withdraw from the game. After rehabbing his injuries on the disabled list, he returned to the lineup and finished the season with a 15–5 record and 1.99 ERA, leading the league in winning percentage (.750) and was second to Steve Carlton in ERA. In the World Series against Oakland that year, he lost Game One (six innings, three runs) and was pulled from the game early in Game Six (4 innings, one earned run).

Arm problems forced Nolan to miss most of 1973, and he missed the entire 1974 season. He returned in 1975 in good form, going 15–9 with a 3.16 ERA. In the World Series against Boston, he pitched just six innings in two starts. In 1976, he duplicated his 15–9 record and finally got his first World Series victory against the Yankees in the last game of a four-game sweep. New arm and shoulder problems bothered him in 1977, and he opted to retire.

In 1975, he earned the Hutch Award, given annually to an active Major League player who &quot;best exemplifies the fighting spirit and competitive desire of Fred Hutchinson by persevering through adversity.&quot; It is presented by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

In his 10-season career, Nolan compiled a 110–70 record with 1,039 strikeouts, a 3.08 ERA, 45 complete games, 14 shutouts, and 1,674.2 innings pitched in 250 games (247 starts). In eleven post season games he was 2–2 with a 3.34 ERA covering 59.1 innings.

Nolan was an excellent fielding pitcher, committing only 3 errors in 287 total chances for a .990 fielding percentage, among the best in history for pitchers whose careers spanned 10 seasons (1,500 innings) or more.

==After baseball==
After retiring from baseball, he worked for 25 years in Las Vegas, first as a blackjack dealer at the Golden Nugget and then as an executive host for guests of hotels/casinos including the Mirage Casino and the Gold Country Casino. In 1999, a baseball park in Oroville was renamed the Gary Nolan Sports Complex. He was elected to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1983.

He moved back to Oroville in 2003, where he is involved with several charitable and civic organizations and works with high school pitchers. In 2011, he was inducted into the Oroville Union High School District Hall of Fame.

<text>Daguerre is a circular formation near the north end of Mare Nectaris. To the west-northwest is the crater Mädler, and beyond it to the west is the prominent Theophilus. To the north in the rugged continental area between the maria is Isidorus.

This feature has the appearance of a lunar impact crater that has been nearly submerged by a lava flow, leaving a gap in the southwest wall that gives the feature the shape of a horse-shoe. The floor is overlaid by the linear ray from Mädler. The maximum altitude of the surviving rim is 1.5 km.

The crater was named after French artist and photographer Louis Daguerre in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Daguerre.

<doc id="954914" wikidata="Q1825724" url="?curid=954914" title="Lincoln Blackwood">
<text>The Lincoln Blackwood is a luxury pickup truck that was marketed by the Lincoln division of Ford Motor Company for the 2002 model year. The first pickup truck marketed by Lincoln, the Blackwood was derived from the Ford F-150 SuperCrew and the Lincoln Navigator. Drawing its name from its simulated black woodgrain cargo box, the Blackwood was offered solely with a black-painted exterior.

Although the concept vehicle had a positive public reception, the production Blackwood fell far under sales projections in the United States and Mexico. After the 2002 model year, the Blackwood was discontinued in the United States, with a short run of 2003 models produced for Mexico. In total, only 3,383 units were produced, making it both the rarest and shortest-produced Lincoln model line. 

For 2006, Lincoln entered the pickup truck segment for a second time with the Lincoln Mark LT, again based on the Ford F-150 which, even though it also sold poorly, it was more popular than Blackwood.

The first Lincoln vehicle manufactured exclusively outside of the state of Michigan since 1958, the Blackwood was assembled by Ford at its Kansas City Assembly facility in Claycomo, Missouri, alongside the F-150 from August 2001 to December 2002.

== Background ==
The 1998 launch of the Lincoln Navigator was met with success; along with becoming the second best-selling Lincoln (behind the Town Car), the Navigator contributed to Lincoln overtaking Cadillac in sales for the first time. To build on its success in the light-truck segment, a Lincoln Blackwood concept vehicle was introduced at the 1999 North American International Auto Show; it was also displayed at the 1999 LA Auto Show. The concept Blackwood received nearly universal approval from the public.

Named the &quot;ultimate utility vehicle&quot; by Ford, the Blackwood was intended to combine the utility of a truck-based vehicle (such as the Navigator or an F-150) with the comfort of a sedan (such as the Town Car), replacing the F-Series pickup bed with an enclosed cargo area bodied with black African wenge wood (adopting a styling element of wood-bodied station wagons). To protect the wood from the elements, it was sealed with epoxy and inlaid with aluminum stripes.

=== Production development ===
Met with nearly universal approval by the public, the Blackwood concept vehicle was approved for production shortly after its display; it was also displayed by Ford at the 1999 Frankfurt Auto Show (a rare appearance of Lincoln vehicles in Europe).

Following its approval for production, the Lincoln Blackwood saw almost no changes made from the 1999 concept vehicle. For a lower ride height and larger tire sidewall, the 19-inch wheels were downsized to 18 inches. To produce the cargo bed at a realistic cost, the of expensive wood was replaced by screened laminate composite panels (the inlaid aluminum strakes remained).

Intended to enter production in early 2001, sales of the Blackwood were delayed several months by supply problems related to the cargo box (produced by Magna Steyr). At the end of 2001, Ford froze their contracts with parent company Magna International in response to the issue.

At the time of its launch, Lincoln was unsure of how many examples of the Blackwood would be produced. Intending to limit yearly production (to maintain exclusivity), Lincoln did plan to sell at least 18,000 vehicles over multiple years.

== Model overview ==

=== Chassis ===
The Lincoln Blackwood uses the chassis of the tenth-generation F-Series (introduced by the 1997 F-150), using a wheelbase. The Blackwood shared its front short-long control arm independent front suspension with the F-150; while retaining the solid rear axle, the rear suspension was also fitted with air springs (closer in line with the Lincoln Town Car).

In contrast to the Lincoln Navigator, all Blackwoods were manufactured with rear-wheel drive (to maintain a lower ride height). The model line had a payload with an towing capacity.

==== Powertrain details ====
Shared with the Navigator, the Blackwood is fitted with a 5.4 L V8, producing . In place of the SOHC 16-valve Triton V8 used by the F-150, the Blackwood used the DOHC 32-valve InTech V8 used by Lincoln; the engine was paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission. 
=== Body design ===
==== Exterior ====
Sharing its cab with the Ford F-150 SuperCrew, the Blackwood sources its front bodywork directly from the Navigator. In contrast to its Ford counterpart, the cargo bed of the Blackwood was constructed of plastic composites. In its namesake design feature, the exterior of the cargo bed was styled with imitation black African wengewood with aluminum-strake inlays (making it the first &quot;woodie&quot; Ford Motor Company vehicle since the LTD Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons, discontinued in 1991).

In another major design change, the rear cargo bed was repurposed as a watertight trunk, adopting a permanently-mounted tonneau cover (power-operated), opening above a 50/50 hinged door (replacing a tailgate). The interior of the Blackwood cargo area was fully carpeted, lined in polished aluminum, and lit with LED lighting. While far smaller in interior size than a similar-length F-150 cargo bed, at , the cargo area of the Blackwood was larger than the trunk of the Lincoln Town Car (itself, the highest-capacity sedan produced at the time).

==== Interior ====
Sourced almost directly from the first-generation Lincoln Navigator, the interior of the Blackwood shares primarily its dashboard with the F-150 (as does the Expedition and Navigator), using imitation black oak wood for interior trim. The model line uses a four-seat 2+2 seating configuration (effectively the front two rows of the Navigator interior), placing a large center console between the two rear seats. All four seats were upholstered in Connolly leather, with heating and cooling for the front seats.

=== Trim ===
In line with the first-generation Navigator, Lincoln offered the Blackwood under a single trim level. The model line was equipped with nearly every available Lincoln feature standard, including a sunroof, premium sound system (cassette player in dashboard with CD changer in front console), and multi-zone automatic climate control.

Only one option was offered for the Blackwood: a vehicle telematics system, which added a voice-activated cellular phone and a GPS navigation system (mounted on a 5-inch front-console screen). Along with standard dual front airbags, the Blackwood was fitted with standard front side airbags.

====Neiman Marcus Edition====

For the 2001 Neiman Marcus spring catalog, Lincoln built a special edition of 50 Neiman Marcus Edition Blackwoods. While sharing the same exterior as a standard Blackwood, several upgrades were made to the interior, including Neiman Marcus logo-embroidered headrests and a modified rear console, including a 7-inch widescreen LCD Panasonic DVD player with wireless headphones; the console also received a cooler/warmer compartment.

While priced at $58,800 ($6,300 higher than a regular Blackwood), the Neiman Marcus Edition Blackwood sold out within less than 24 hours of its release.

== Reception ==
The Blackwood was a major commercial failure, withdrawn from the market in a year; selling off the remaining inventory took two more years. Reviewers wrote about its lack of utility and off-road capability. Naming the Blackwood one of &quot;The 20 Dumbest Cars of All Time&quot;, Autoblog stated, &quot;Ford CEO Jacques Nasser and his luxury brand chief Wolfgang Reitzle thought it was a great idea: a luxury Lincoln branded pickup truck with a trunk instead of a flat bed and pin-stripe painting to mimic a business suit. [The Blackwood was] one of those vanity projects hatched at the top.&quot; &quot;Car and Driver&quot; named it one of the worst flops of the past 25 years, saying, &quot;Check out the cargo box: It&#x27;s lined in carpet and gen-yoo-wine stainless steel. That&#x27;s stainless—means it can&#x27;t be stained. You can&#x27;t carry nuthin&#x27; heavy or dirty in it without uglying it up, but it makes for a nice trunk, see?&quot; Jalopnik included the Blackwood on its list of &quot;Ten Cars That Should Have Never Left the Factory&quot;, saying &quot;Riding the cheap upgrade, big margin wave of the Navigator, Ford gave its F-150 the same treatment, calling it the Blackwood. Except they stripped out every ounce of actual utility from the vehicle, save for towing, by making it a RWD-only pickup with an Aluminum lined, carpeted, power tonneau&#x27;d bed. This was where they decided to pour their resources rather than refining their new RWD LS sedan. This is a symbol of the fall of the brand. Now we&#x27;re stuck with a lifeless shell of a company, making badge engineered Fords that bastardize the Mark (MK?) name.&quot;

Although the Blackwood&#x27;s RWD-only configuration limited off-road utility, air suspension and a Crown Victoria cop-car steering rack gave good handling and a ride that more akin to a car than a truck. Despite its lack of success, the Blackwood &quot;did foreshadow the changes that were to come in the pickup-truck market. Trucks with luxury amenities have become much more popular, and many high-line trucks now resemble luxury cars in the cabin. The Blackwood was a truck ahead of its time.&quot;
Introduced alongside the Blackwood for 2002, the Cadillac Escalade EXT outsold the model line more than four-to-one. While also sold as a crew-cab pickup truck from an American luxury brand, the Escalade EXT was available with multiple utility features favored by buyers, including optional four-wheel drive, an open-roof cargo area, and multiple colors. Based on the Chevrolet Avalanche, the Escalade EXT had a reconfigurable interior with five-passenger seating. 

After the 2002 model year, Lincoln ended sales of the Blackwood in the United States, with all 2003 production of the model line sold in Mexico; the final Lincoln Blackwood rolled off the assembly line in December 2002, 15 months after its entry into production.

== Epilogue ==
For 2006, Lincoln reentered the pickup truck segment with Lincoln Mark LT. Again, based on the Ford F-150, the Mark LT abandoned many of the model-unique features of the Blackwood in favor of gaining the functionality of a pickup truck. While massively outsold by its Ford counterpart, the Mark LT proved more successful than its predecessor, nearly matching the Escalade EXT in sales.

After the 2008 model year, Ford ended sales of the Mark LT in United States, effectively replaced by the Platinum and Limited trims, added to both the F-150 and Super Duty versions of the F-Series. While Cadillac ended sales of the Escalade EXT pickup after 2013, GM continued production of luxury-oriented pickups through its GMC &quot;Denali&quot; sub-brand. In 2018, the Ford F-450 Super Duty Limited became the first factory-produced pickup truck with a price of over $100,000, and pickups with a price tag over $100,000 have become more common since, espically following the 2021–2023 inflation.

<text>Dembowski is a lunar impact crater located to the southeast of the Sinus Medii. Its diameter is 26 km. It was named after Italian astronomer Ercole Dembowski. To the east are the craters Agrippa and Godin, to the southwest is Rhaeticus.

The floor of Dembowski is covered by lava flow that has eradicated the eastern half of the rim, leaving only a slight rise in the surface where the outer wall once lay. The surviving western half of the rim is polygonal in shape, and the ends are broken; forming rises in the surface. The flow of basaltic lava appears to have reached the crater through an irregular channel running in a southern direction from the Sinus Medii.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dembowski.

<doc id="954941" wikidata="Q2865359" url="?curid=954941" title="Arthur Thistlewood">
<text>Arthur Thistlewood (1774–1 May 1820) was an English radical activist and conspirator in the Cato Street Conspiracy. He planned to murder the cabinet, but there was a spy and he was apprehended with 12 other conspirators. He killed a policeman during the raid. He was executed for treason.

==Early life==

He was born in Tupholme in Lincolnshire, the extramarital son of a farmer and stockbreeder. He attended Horncastle Grammar School and was trained as a land surveyor. Unsatisfied with his job, he obtained a commission in the army at the age of 21. 

In January 1804, he married Jane Worsley but she died two years later giving birth to their first child. In 1808 he married Susan Wilkinson. He then quit his commission in the army and, with the help of his father, bought a farm. The farm was not a success and in 1811 he moved to London.

Thistlewood was the nephew of Thomas Thistlewood (1721‒1786), a British-born slave owner and plantation overseer in colonial Jamaica.

==Beginning of revolutionary involvement==

Travel in France and the United States exposed Thistlewood to revolutionary ideas. Shortly after his return to England, he joined the Society of Spencean Philanthropists in London. By 1816, Thistlewood had become a leader in the organisation, and was labelled a &quot;dangerous character&quot; by police, who watched him closely.

==Spa Fields==

On 2 December 1816, a mass meeting took place at Spa Fields. The Spenceans had planned to encourage rioting all across England and then seize control of the British government by taking the Tower of London and the Bank of England. Police learned of the plan and dispersed the meeting. Thistlewood attempted to flee to North America. 

He and three other leaders were arrested and charged with high treason. When James Watson was acquitted, the authorities released Thistlewood and the others as well.

In 1817 Thistlewood challenged the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, to a duel and was imprisoned in Horsham gaol for 12 months.

==Cato Street Conspiracy==

On 22 February 1820 Thistlewood was one of a small group of Spenceans who decided, at the prompting of an undercover police agent George Edwards, to assassinate the British cabinet at a dinner the next day hosted by an earl. The group gathered in a loft in the Marylebone area of London, where police officers apprehended the conspirators. Edwards, a police spy, had fabricated the story of the dinner. Thistlewood was convicted of treason for his part in the Cato Street Conspiracy and, together with co-conspirators John Thomas Brunt, William Davidson, John Ings and Richard Tidd, was publicly hanged and decapitated outside Newgate Prison on 1 May 1820.

<doc id="954943" wikidata="Q131854" url="?curid=954943" title="Klebsiella">
<text>Klebsiella is a genus of Gram-negative, oxidase-negative, rod-shaped bacteria with a prominent polysaccharide-based capsule.

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; is named after German-Swiss microbiologist Edwin Klebs (1834–1913). Carl Friedlander described &quot;Klebsiella&quot; bacillus which is why it was termed &quot;Friedlander bacillus&quot; for many years. The species of &quot;Klebsiella&quot; are all gram-negative and usually non-motile. They tend to be shorter and thicker when compared to others in the family Enterobacteriaceae. 

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; species are found everywhere in nature. This is thought to be due to distinct sublineages developing specific niche adaptations, with associated biochemical adaptations which make them better suited to a particular environment. They can be found in water, soil, plants, insects and other animals including humans, including as part of the human and animal&#x27;s normal flora in the nose, mouth and intestines.

==List of species==
* &quot;K. aerogenes&quot;, previously known as &quot;Enterobacter aerogenes&quot; and &quot;Bacterium aerogenes&quot;
* &quot;K. granulomatis&quot;
* &quot;K. oxytoca&quot;
* &quot;K. michiganensis&quot;
* &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; (type-species)
** &quot;K. p.&quot; subsp. &quot;ozaenae&quot;
** &quot;K. p.&quot; subsp. &quot;pneumoniae&quot;
** &quot;K. p.&quot; subsp. &quot;rhinoscleromatis&quot;
* &quot;K. quasipneumoniae&quot;
** &quot;K. q.&quot; subsp. &quot;quasipneumoniae&quot;
** &quot;K. q.&quot; subsp. &quot;similipneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;K. grimontii&quot;
* &quot;K. variecola&quot;

==Features==

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; bacteria tend to be rounder and thicker than other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. They typically occur as straight rods with rounded or slightly pointed ends. They can be found singly, in pairs, or in short chains. Diplobacillary forms are commonly found &quot;in vivo&quot;.

They have no specific growth requirements and grow well on standard laboratory media, but grow best between 35 and 37 °C and at pH 7.2. The species are facultative anaerobes, and most strains can survive with citrate and glucose as their sole carbon sources and ammonia as their sole nitrogen source.

Members of the genus produce a prominent capsule, or slime layer, which can be used for serologic identification, but molecular serotyping may replace this method.

Members of the genus &quot;Klebsiella&quot; typically express two types of antigens on their cell surfaces. The first, O antigen, is a component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), of which 9 varieties exist. The second is K antigen, a capsular polysaccharide with more than 80 varieties. Both contribute to pathogenicity and form the basis for serogrouping. Based on those two major antigenic determinants several vaccines have been designed.

== In humans ==

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; species are routinely found in the human nose, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract as normal flora; however, they can also behave as opportunistic human pathogens. &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species are known to also infect a variety of other animals, both as normal flora and opportunistic pathogens.

&quot;Klebsiella&quot; organisms can lead to a wide range of disease states, notably pneumonia, urinary tract infections, sepsis, meningitis, diarrhea, peritonitis and soft tissue infections. &quot;Klebsiella&quot; species have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies. The majority of human &quot;Klebsiella&quot; infections are caused by &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot;, followed by &quot;K. oxytoca&quot;. Infections are more common in the very young, very old, and those with other underlying diseases, such as cancer, and most infections involve contamination of an invasive medical device.

During the last 40 years, many trials for constructing effective &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; vaccines have been tried, and new techniques were followed to construct vaccines against &quot;Klebsiella&quot;. However, currently, no &quot;Klebsiella&quot; vaccine has been licensed for use in the US. &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; is the most common cause of nosocomial respiratory tract and premature intensive care infections, and the second-most frequent cause of Gram-negative bacteraemia and urinary tract infections . Drug-resistant isolates remain an important hospital-acquired bacterial pathogen, add significantly to hospital stays, and are especially problematic in high-impact medical areas such as intensive care units. This antimicrobial resistance is thought to be attributable mainly to multidrug efflux pumps. The ability of &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; to colonize the hospital environment, including carpeting, sinks, flowers, and various surfaces, as well as the skin of patients and hospital staff, has been identified as a major factor in the spread of hospital-acquired infections.

== In animals ==

In addition to certain &quot;Klebsiella&quot; spp. being discovered as human pathogens, others such as &quot;K. variicola&quot; have been identified as emerging pathogens in humans and animals alike. For instance, &quot;K. variicola&quot; has been identified as one of the causes of bovine mastitis.

==In plants==

In plant systems, &quot;Klebsiella&quot; can be found in a variety of plant hosts. &quot;K. pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;K. oxytoca&quot; are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen into a form that can be used by plants, thus are called associative nitrogen fixers or diazotrophs. The bacteria attach strongly to root hairs and less strongly to the surface of the zone of elongation and the root cap mucilage. They are bacteria of interest in an agricultural context, due to their ability to increase crop yields under agricultural conditions. Their high numbers in plants are thought to be at least partly attributable to their lack of a flagellum, as flagella are known to induce plant defenses. Additionally, &quot;K. variicola&quot; is known to associate with a number of different plants including banana trees, sugarcane and has been isolated from the fungal gardens of leaf-cutter ants.

<text>The Continental Mark VII, later changed to Lincoln Mark VII, is a rear wheel drive luxury coupe that was produced by Lincoln. Introduced in August 1983 for the 1984 model year, the Continental Mark VII shared the Ford Fox platform with the Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar, and Lincoln Continental, the platform having been introduced for the 1978 Ford Fairmont and Mercury Zephyr and used for the 1982–1987 Lincoln Continental sedan and Mark VII four-door. Like its predecessor the Continental Mark VI, the Mark VII was manufactured at the Wixom Assembly Plant in Wixom, Michigan through 1992. It was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII in 1993.

The Mark VII featured standard equipment including an onboard trip computer / message center and digital instruments (on all except the LSC models after 1985), and four wheel air suspension. The 1985 LSC was the first American vehicle with electronic 4-channel anti-lock brakes. 

==Continental Mark VII (1984–1985)==
The Continental Mark VII was introduced in August 1983 for model year 1984. It was available in a base trim level, Designer Edition (Bill Blass Edition and Versace Edition). A new sport-oriented upper trim level was introduced with this generation, marketed as the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe). Alongside the standard 140 hp 5.0L V8 shared with the Ford Mustang is a 114 hp 2.4L turbocharged diesel inline-6 obtained from BMW to offer a more fuel efficient engine offering; all Mark VIIs came with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

The Mark VII featured standard equipment including a fully digital dashboard, onboard trip computer, message center, automatic climate control four-wheel air suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, sensitivity adjustable automatic dimming high-beam lights and AM/FM stereo — as well as power seats, windows, locks, mirrors, deck-lid release and trunk lid pull-down, where the last movement of the closing trunk lid was power assisted. All models now featured Ford&#x27;s proprietary door-mounted keypad entry system marketed as &quot;Securicode&quot;.

The Mark VII was the first modern American manufactured vehicle to be equipped with a replaceable bulb headlamp system. Ford had petitioned NHTSA for a rule change permitting replaceable bulb headlamp systems, which was enacted in the summer of 1983 in time for the introduction of the Mark VII. 1985 was the last year for the Mark Series to include the &quot;Continental&quot; name as its nomenclature. The dealer-installed GTC performance option package is introduced (see below). As they have largely been replaced by cassette tapes, the 8-track tape player option is discontinued. An in-car telephone is added to the options list for $2,995 ($ in dollars ).

==Lincoln Mark VII (1986–1992)==

For 1986, the Mark series was integrated into the Lincoln brand after being within the Continental marque for 18 years, ending the naming confusion. The Continental Mark VII was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII and given Lincoln badges with the first three digits of the VIN changed from 1MR Continental to 1LN Lincoln. Other visual changes involved the addition of a federally mandated center brake light (CHMSL). The rarely-seen BMW diesel was dropped from the line, as was the Versace Edition. A number of changes were made for the LSC for 1986 to differentiate it from the rest of the Mark VII line. To update its performance image, the 1986 LSC was given analog gauges in place of the all-digital dash; the engine output increased to 200 hp. Largely unchanged from 1986, a running change late in 1987 production added the 225 hp 5.0L &quot;H.O.&quot; to a limited number of LSC models. 1987 would be the last year the Mark VII offered an optional CB radio. Since vent windows had all but disappeared on American automobiles by the 1980s, the option for them was discontinued for 1987.

For 1988, the Mark VII model line was revised. As the Mark VII carried a large list of features, the base-trim model was discontinued, leaving the luxury-oriented Bill Blass Edition and the performance-oriented LSC; both versions were priced the same. The 150 hp and 200 hp versions of the 5.0L V8 were replaced by the 225 hp &quot;H.O.&quot; version; shared with the Mustang GT, it was sold in both Bill Blass and LSC Mark VIIs. On LSC models, wheel size was increased to 16 inches. For 1989, relatively few changes were made to the Mark VII. To improve the handling of LSC models, Lincoln made changes to the steering. The 1989 model was the last year with a hood ornament.

For 1990, to accommodate passive-restraint regulations, the Mark VII was given a driver-side airbag and three-point seatbelts were added to the outboard rear seats. Since it had not been updated since 1984, the dashboard and interior controls were given a redesign; LSC models saw the addition of a 120-mph speedometer. LSC models were given 16-inch wheels with a design that was essentially a clone of the BBS RA wheel. To give new life to the Mark VII, the monochromatic LSC SE (Special Edition) was introduced.

For 1991, the Mark VII line is consolidated mechanically, as the Bill Blass Edition adopts the suspension and wheels of the LSC; the Bill Blass Edition is largely differentiated by its use of a digital dashboard. Both versions are given redesigned seats (distinguished by lower headrests). For 1992, the Mark VII saw no major changes from 1991. A new color, Deep Jewel Green Metallic Clearcoat, was introduced and is very rare. A total of 190,832 Mark VIIs were produced.

== Variants ==

=== Aftermarket ===
The Mark VII GTC was a Lincoln-Mercury dealer-sold car built by Cars &amp; Concepts with monochromatic paint, a body kit, and available performance upgrades. A select few were sent to Jack Roush Performance for suspension enhancements and optional 5.8L and T5 manual transmission conversions. There was also a &#x27;Comtech&#x27; Mark VII, with a CRT touch screen, which did exist in at least one vehicle, it was on loan to Bob Bondurant while he had his driving school at Sears Point Raceway. Ford Motor Company allowed him to have a fleet of new vehicles every year, and one of Bob&#x27;s choices was the Comtech Mark VII. Larry Albedi Motors (Lincoln-Mercury) in Vallejo, California, serviced the vehicle a couple of times before it was returned to Ford at the end of the year. The Comtech parts that were unique to that Mark VII were also listed in the Lincoln Mercury parts catalog, but when the Merkur arrived the Comtech pages were removed and the Merkur pages replaced them. The Comtech model being a prototype, they saw no reason to keep it in the parts catalog.

==Powertrain==
The engine choices were a 5.0 L V8 and rare (approximately 2,300 made) 2.4 L I6 diesel. The diesel was a BMW design with a turbocharger and only available in 1984 and 1985. At least one diesel Mark VII was reportedly equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission.

== Production ==
==Racing==
The Mark VII was raced in the Trans-Am Series in 1984 and 1985 without much success, with the best result being a ninth-place finish.

==Awards==
The Mark VII &quot;LSC&quot; was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1986.

<doc id="954977" wikidata="Q2561006" url="?curid=954977" title="Lincoln Mark VIII">
<text>The Lincoln Mark VIII is a grand touring luxury sport coupe that was marketed by Lincoln from the 1993 to 1998 model years. The first generation of the Mark series branded entirely as a Lincoln, the Mark VIII again served as a counterpart of the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar. Though maintaining its traditional brand rivalry with the Cadillac Eldorado, the Mark VIII was also developed to become more competitive against luxury coupes from automakers around the world. 

Replacing the Fox platform of the Mark VII, the Mark VIII was the exclusive model to use the FN10 chassis, a derivative of the MN12 platform developed for the Thunderbird and Cougar. Growing slightly in size (primarily in wheelbase), the Mark VIII was developed with independent suspension for all four wheels; at the time, the only other rear-wheel drive American cars to do so (alongside the Thunderbird and Cougar) were the Chevrolet Corvette and Dodge Viper RT/10. Matching the Cadillac Northstar engine, the Mark VIII was fitted with a dual-overhead cam 4.6L V8, the first Ford Motor Company vehicle fitted with such an engine. 

Through its six-year production run, the Mark VIII was manufactured by Ford at its Wixom Assembly Plant (Wixom, Michigan). As of current production, the model line is the final generation of the Mark series and Lincoln has not introduced a direct successor to the model line ever since its 1998 discontinuation. 

==Development==

Development of the Mark VIII (FN-10) began in 1984 with a projected release for the 1990 model year. Design work began in 1986 and was oriented toward evolutionary changes. By 1987, Lincoln designers emphasized interior design, as ordered by then Ford design director Dave Rees. In the autumn of 1988, FN-10 development was pushed and went through several revisions. This was done to further develop a more precise product to accommodate the use of a DOHC modular engine, using the upcoming MN12 platform due to be launched in December 1988.

=== Stretch designs ===
Having seen designs of upcoming models from competitors, Ford ordered a radical redesign, a departure from any previous Lincolns, while retaining styling cues. By November 1988, under Ford designer Kyu Kim, Ford presented a design named &quot;Stretch I&quot;, featuring scalloped sides, full length taillights, the spare-tire hump, waterfall grille, small C-pillars, a full-length headlight setup, two air inlets on the front bumper, taillights that flowed upward on the sides rather than downward on the production car — and devoid of chrome. A clay mockup of Stretch I was finalized within four weeks.

&quot;Stretch I&quot; was shown in 1:1 scale in clay to Lincoln executives on December 12, 1988. Appalled by the design, the executives ordered several changes to the exterior. As a result, &quot;Stretch II&quot; was created during early 1989, by adding chrome in several places and moderately revising the front and rear end treatments. Stretch II represented about 70 percent of the finished product, with details revised up to mid-1989. 

The final design freeze of the FN-10 Mark VIII occurred, scheduled for an April 1992 start of production and June 1992 launch as a 1993 model year vehicle. FN-10 prototype mules in modified Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar bodies began road-testing in 1990. Full-body prototypes later commenced road-testing in the first half of 1991. In February 1991, launch was delayed by 6 months to December 1992. 

The 1993 Mark VIII was unveiled by the press in March 1992 and officially introduced to the public on November 18, 1992, at a Hotel Mark in New York City. Production of the 1992 Mark VII ended at the Wixom Plant in April 1992 to facilitate retooling for October production commencement of the Mark VIII.

==Model history==

The 1993 Mark VIII was a larger car than its predecessor, being about five inches longer and nearly four inches wider than the Mark VII. The car also had a wheelbase of , over longer than the Mark VII&#x27;s, which afforded greater interior space and ride quality. In spite of its larger overall size, the Mark VIII&#x27;s base curb weight was slightly lighter than the Mark VII at a little over .
The Mark VIII featured unibody construction with a high-strength roof, heavy-gauge steel door beams to protect against side impacts, front and rear crumple zones, dual front-side airbags, and four-wheel antilock disc brakes. It also featured a short-long arm (SLA) four-wheel independent suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars and a standard computer-controlled air suspension with sensors to automatically lower the ride height at high speed, enhancing the car&#x27;s aerodynamics. Powering the Mark VIII was an all-new, all-aluminum DOHC 32-valve V8. The engine was the first of its kind in Ford&#x27;s Modular engine family and produced at 5500 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm, and required premium grade 91-octane fuel for optimum performance. Handling the V8&#x27;s power was the 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission with overdrive. The Mark VIII&#x27;s rear axle ratio was 3.08:1. Also featured were standard chrome dual exhaust tips and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels.

The Mark VIII uses a 140-mph speedometer, an electronic message center (giving time, compass heading, fuel efficiency, engine oil life, and various other vehicle-related warnings and information), automatic climate control, cruise control, leather seating surfaces, six-way power driver and passenger seats with power lumbar supports, a two-position memory for the power driver&#x27;s seat, power door locks, heated power mirrors, power windows with a driver&#x27;s-side express-down feature, illuminated keyless entry with remote, automatic headlamps, an AM/FM stereo-cassette radio, and an automatic power antenna. Options included a power moonroof, electrochromic automatic dimming mirrors (which filtered out headlight glare from behind), an AM/FM stereo-CD player, a 10-disc CD changer, and a JBL speaker system.

For 1995, the Mark VIII received a slightly updated instrument panel along with a new radio design. Arriving midyear was a new LSC (Luxury Sport Coupe) model. A retuned version of the standard 4.6 L DOHC V8, now marketed under the name &quot;InTech&quot; regardless of model, with a true dual exhaust, produced at 5750 rpm and of torque at 4500 rpm. The Mark VIII LSC used the same 4R70W automatic transmission as the standard Mark VIII, but featured a more aggressive rear axle ratio of 3.27:1. The brochure for the 1995 Lincoln Mark VIII LSC claims a acceleration time of 7.5 seconds. The LSC featured unique body colors, distinct rear decklid badging, perforated leather seat inserts, and floor mats. The bright chrome inserts normally found in the body-side moulding and bumper on the Mark VIII were replaced with monochrome body color inserts on the LSC. The 1995 Mark VIII LSC also marked the first domestic use of HID headlights.

A Diamond Anniversary package was offered on the 1996 Mark VIII to commemorate Lincoln&#x27;s 75th anniversary. It featured &quot;Diamond Anniversary&quot; badging, leather seats, voice-activated cellular phone, JBL audio system, auto electrochromatic dimming mirror with compass, and traction control.

=== 1997 facelift ===
Development of an updated FN-10 began in 1993, with a design freeze occurring in November 1994. The first prototypes were built in September 1995, testing into mid-1996. In September 1996, Alcan Aluminum Limited won a bid to supply hoods for the revised FN-10. In the fall of 1996, the Mark VIII received a significant facelift since its 1992 debut, featuring smoother, more rounded front and rear fascias and a larger grille. The car&#x27;s hood was now aluminum (versus plastic before) and the trunk carried a more subtle version of the &quot;spare tire hump&quot; associated with earlier Mark Series cars. HID headlamps became standard and were placed in larger housings compared to earlier models. A neon brake light ran across the rear decklid. Side mirrors now came with puddle lamps, which, upon unlocking the doors, illuminated the ground for the driver and passengers to see when entering the car. The side-view mirror housings also incorporated flashing LED turn signal lamps to warn other drivers of an intended lane change or turn. The interior included &#x27;theater lighting&#x27;, which softly illuminated the driver&#x27;s controls and handles. 

The InTech V8 carried on as before, but now came with a distributorless coil-on-plug ignition system, eliminating the use of high-voltage spark plug wires. Some of the internal components of the 4R70W automatic transmission were reinforced for greater durability and reliability in late 1997 models and all 1998 models. LSC models had firmer shocks and larger stabilizer bars for even better handling and control. All-speed traction control was now standard, and could be deactivated via the onboard systems status computer when desired.

Toward the end of Mark VIII production, Lincoln offered two personalized &quot;specialty&quot; models: the Spring Feature and the Collector&#x27;s Edition. Mark VIII production ended with the 1998 model year. The new four-door mid-sized Lincoln LS, introduced June 1999 as a 2000 model, served as a replacement for the Mark VIII.

== Motorsport ==
Under direction of Jim Kennedy, Senior Ford engineer, a team of engineers was assembled to take a stock Mark VIII to the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 1992 to compete in the World Finals, attempting to exceed the existing class speed record of 163 mph. John Engfehr and Henry Neubauer from the Ford engine lab headed up the engine performance team at the salt flats. The Mark VIII ran an official Southern California Timing Association average speed over two runs of 181.171 for the new record. This car was rediscovered by Land Speed Racers in Texas who restored the car to its original racing form in 2021 and hold three new land speed records in the stock under 5 liter class for the 1/2 mile, 1 mile and 2 km. with the East Coast Timing Association.

In 1996, Michael Kranefuss built a prototype stock car for potential competition in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series ahead of the announcement that the Ford Thunderbird would be discontinued after 1997. The project was stopped by Ford for brand image reasons. Ford instead fielded the Ford Taurus for NASCAR&#x27;s top two divisions in 1998.

<text>Propionibacterium is a gram-positive, anaerobic, rod-shaped genus of bacteria named for their unique metabolism: They are able to synthesize propionic acid by using unusual transcarboxylase enzymes.

Its members are primarily facultative parasites and commensals of humans and other animals, living in and around the sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and other areas of the skin. They are virtually ubiquitous and do not cause problems for most people, but propionibacteria have been implicated in acne and other skin conditions. One study found the &quot;Propionibacterium&quot; was the most prevalent human skin-associated genus of microorganisms.

In ruminants, propionibacteria reduce nitrate to nontoxic nitrogen compounds.

Members of the genus &quot;Propionibacterium&quot; are widely used in the production of vitamin B12, tetrapyrrole compounds, and propionic acid, as well as in the probiotics and cheese industries.

The strain &quot;Propionibacterium freudenreichii&quot; subsp. &quot;shermanii&quot; is used in cheesemaking to create CO2 bubbles that become &quot;eyes&quot;—round holes in the cheese.

== Pathology ==
&quot;Propionibacterium&quot; &quot;spp.&quot; are commensal bacteria that can occasionally cause infectious diseases. The most studied of these infections is acne vulgaris, caused by &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; (formerly &quot;Propionibacterium acnes)&quot;. It is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the blockage of pilosebaceous units causing inflammatory lesions, non-inflammatory lesions or a mixture of both on the face, neck and/or chest. Acne vulgaris cannot be defined as an infectious disease since the bacteria is found on a vast majority of individuals without causing lesions. &quot;C. acnes&quot; colonize the skin only under certain favorable conditions. In most cases, &quot;C. acnes&quot; get trapped under the comedones where they proliferate to form micro-comedones, not visible to the naked eye, which can later form structures such as closed comedones (white heads) and open comedones. These comedones can rupture, releasing the follicular material inside the dermis. The cause of this rupture was thought to be the indirect effect of fat metabolism by the bacteria, however it was later found that bacteria are directly involved in comedome rupturing by producing factors such as proteases, hyaluronidases and neuraminidases which might be involved in thinning of the epithelium. &quot;C. acnes&quot; can also produce immune factors such as proinflammatory cytokine inducing-factors and chemotactic factors, and can induce host complement pathways.

<text>HemisFair &#x27;68 was the official 1968 World&#x27;s Fair (or International Exposition) held in San Antonio, Texas, from April 6 through October 6, 1968. Local businessman and civic leader, Jerome K. Harris Sr., coined the name HemisFair and conceived the idea for the fair, hoping it would unite all the cultures that comprise San Antonio and solidify the city&#x27;s reputation as a cultural and historic destination. With help from commissioner Henry B. Gonzales and other San Antonio leaders, the fair materialized and helped transform the city from a cowtown to one of the largest cities in the country. The theme of the fair was &quot;The Confluence of Civilizations in the Americas&quot;, celebrating the many nations which settled the region. The fair was held in 1968 to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the founding of San Antonio in 1718. More than thirty nations and fifteen corporations hosted pavilions at the fair.

The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) which oversees World&#x27;s Fairs and Expositions, awarded HemisFair &#x27;68 with official Fair status on November 17, 1965.

The theme character of the fair was a dragon named Luther created by Sid and Marty Krofft, who was later renamed and starred in the Kroffts&#x27; Saturday morning television show &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. The main premise of the show was taken from their production for the Coca-Cola pavilion at the fair.

==Funding==
The venture, which had an announced cost of $156 million, was financed by a combination of public and private funds. Public funding included $12.2 million from the U.S. Housing and Home Finance Agency for acquiring and clearing the site, $11 million in publicly approved city bonds for construction of the convention center and arena, $5.5 million in general revenues from the City of San Antonio for construction of the Tower of the Americas, $10 million from the State of Texas primarily for the construction of the Texas State Pavilion, and $7.5 million from the United States Congress for the construction of the United States pavilion.

Although HemisFair &#x27;68 attracted 6.3 million visitors and brought international attention to San Antonio and Texas, attendance never matched predictions, and the fair lost $7.5 million.

==Site==
The fair was built on a site on the southeastern edge of Downtown San Antonio. The site was acquired mainly through eminent domain. Many structures in what was considered a blighted area were demolished and moved to make room for the fair. The project was partially developed with federal urban renewal funds. The San Antonio Conservation Society recommended that 129 structures on the site be preserved; however, on August 9, 1966, an agreement was made to save only 20 existing structures that would be incorporated into the fair site. Overall, only 24 structures were saved.

In addition, as a part of the overall HemisFair project, the city extended its River Walk (Paseo del Rio) one-quarter of a mile into the site in order to link the River Walk and the HemisFair grounds in 1968. In 2001, the River Walk was extended again under the new Convention Center Expansion and is now connected to a small lagoon inside HemisFair Park.

==Opening ceremonies==
HemisFair began on April 6, 1968, with the gates opening at 9:00am and official ceremonies beginning at 10:00am in the new Convention Center Arena. However, with the opening just two days after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., VIPs in attendanceincluding U.S. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally, both of whom received death threatswere escorted around the site under heavy security.

==Pavilions at HemisFair==
National pavilions at the fair included: Canada, Mexico, Italy, Spain, France, Japan, Belgium, Bolivia, Republic of China, Colombia, West Germany, South Korea, Panama, Portugal, Switzerland, Thailand and Venezuela. There were also shared pavilions such as a five-nation Central American pavilion, representing Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica and the special pavilions of the Organization of American States, which represented eleven more Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, and Peru.

Corporate pavilions at the fair included: Eastman Kodak, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil), IBM, RCA, Southwestern Bell (now AT&amp;T), Frito Lay, Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola, American Express, Chrysler, and 3M.

Other pavilions at the fair included: the LDS Church, the Southern Baptist pavilion, the Women&#x27;s Pavilion and Project Y (Youth Pavilion).

==Monorail==
A 7,600-foot monorail, named Mini-Monorail, connected pavilions together. The monorail was manufactured by Universal Design Limited and constructed by H.C.P. Enterprises. Ten days prior to the opening of the fair, on April 27, 1968, an electrical incident caused a fire. Later, an accident occurred on September 15, 1968 in which two trains collided and derailed. A 63 year old woman died and 48 others were injured.

==Legacy==

After HemisFair, much of the land ownership was transferred to the State of Texas and the U.S. federal government. Today, the City of San Antonio owns approximately of the site, 30 of which the Henry B. González Convention Center occupies.

In 1986, many unused remaining structures built for the fair were removed and in celebration of the 20th Anniversary of HemisFair &#x27;68, approximately of the site were redeveloped with cascading waterfalls, fountains, playgrounds and lush landscaping. Many of the improvements were concentrated near the base of the Tower of the Americas. At the site&#x27;s re-dedication in April 1988, the site was re-christened &quot;HemisFair Park&quot;.

In 2008 Hyatt Hotels completed construction of the Grand Hyatt San Antonio on the north and eastern sides of the convention center theater originally built for HemisFair &#x27;68. It features guest rooms on the first 24 floors and condos on the last 10, all rooms on the south side have an unobstructed view of HemisFair Park and the Tower of the Americas.

===Venues still on the site today===
As of spring 2013, only a handful of structures built/renovated for the HemisFair remain on the former fairgrounds and are still open to the public.

Convention Center Theater – The theater (now Lila Cockrell Theater) was built as one of a three-building complex (along with the Convention Center and Arena) during the buildup for HemisFair &#x27;68 and leased to San Antonio Fair, Inc. for use during the fair. Sometime after the fair it was renamed in honor of the city&#x27;s former three-term mayor Lila Cockrell. After decades of limited upgrades, the building received a 26 million dollar renovation in 2010.
Above the windows on the exterior is a mural titled &quot;Confluence of Civilizations in the Americas,&quot; created by Mexican artist Juan O&#x27;Gorman for HemisFair &#x27;68.

Eastman Kodak Pavilion – Built next to the Women&#x27;s Pavilion, this venue has seen little to no use since the fair. It is projected that this building will be demolished to provide room for the eventual expansion of the Women&#x27;s Pavilion.

Gulf Insurance Pavilion – Built near the Tower of the Americas as a rest area, today it is closed to the public and serves as storage and support for the tower.

Humble Oil Pavilion – Originally built in the 19th century, this building was renovated for HemisFair &#x27;68, and housed the exhibit and theater for Humble Oil (now ExxonMobil). In recent years the building was renovated again and now serves as additional banquet and ballroom facilities for the Hilton Palacio del Rio Hotel (also built for HemisFair) across the street.

Mexico Pavilion – This, now the Mexican Cultural Institute, is the only national pavilion still in its original location, although the original structure was modified and expanded during the expansion of the adjacent convention center and was re-opened in 2002.

Southern Baptist Pavilion – This building was originally a house, built in the late 19th century, as a wedding gift from Sam Edgar to his daughter. It was renovated for HemisFair &#x27;68 to house the exhibits for the Southern Baptist Convention. In 2012 the house was renovated again and now serves as offices for the Hemisfair Park Area Redevelopment Corporation.

State of Texas Pavilion – The fair&#x27;s largest pavilion belonged to the state of Texas. This pavilion also remained after the fair closed and became the Institute of Texan Cultures, which is now a museum and the third campus of the University of Texas at San Antonio.

Tower of the Americas – The fair&#x27;s theme structure is this 750-foot-tall (228 m) tower, which remains today as San Antonio&#x27;s tallest structure. The top of the tower houses a revolving restaurant, lounge, and outdoor observation deck. It was designed by architect O&#x27;Neil Ford.
United States of America Pavilion – The United States Confluence Theater (now the John H. Wood, Jr. United States District Court for the Western District of Texas) remains today as well as the Confluence Exhibit Hall (now the Adrian Spears Judicial Training Center). Part of the pavilion was a fountain called &quot;Migration.&quot; Although the bird sculptures have been replaced with bushes, the outline of the fountain is still in place.

Women&#x27;s Pavilion – The theme of this venue was to showcase the contributions that women have made to society, past, present and future. It was built as a permanent structure to help meet the requirements of urban renewal, as well as to be part of the re-use plan after the fair. One idea was for it to be re-used as a student union building, as one proposal was to locate the new University of Texas at San Antonio campus on the site. After decades of use as a storage facility by the Institute of Texan Cultures, several women who were originally involved with the pavilion are working to restore and reopen it.

==HemisFair Park Area Redevelopment Corporation==

In 2009, the San Antonio City Council under the leadership of Mayor Julián Castro created a non-profit organization, the HemisFair Park Area Redevelopment Corporation (HPARC), to generate ideas and oversee the redevelopment of the former fairgrounds, which had seen little development since 1988.

In 2012, HPARC completed the renovation of three indigenous structures on the site which now serve as offices (Eagar House), conference center (Carriage House), and support services (Eagar Dependency) for HPARC. Along with the renovations, the San Antonio City Council voted on and approved HPARC&#x27;s master plan for the redevelopment of the former site. The plan includes the development of three public parks: Yanaguana Garden, Civic Park and Tower Park.

In 2015, the San Antonio City Council unanimously approved renaming the area from &quot;HemisFair Park&quot; to &quot;Hemisfair,&quot; recognizing it as an urban parks district.

On October 2, 2015, Yanaguana Garden opened to the public.

<text>Hyginus is a lunar caldera located at the east end of the Sinus Medii. It was named after ancient Roman astronomer Gaius Julius Hyginus. Its rim is split by a 220 kilometer-long rille, Rima Hyginus, that branches to the northwest and to the east-southeast. The crater is deeper than the rille, and lies at intersection of the rille&#x27;s branches. Together, the crater and the rille form a prominent feature in an otherwise flat surface. Smaller craters along the length of the rille may have been caused by the collapse of an underlying structure.

Hyginus is one of the few craters on the Moon that was not created as a result of an impact, and is instead believed to be volcanic in origin. It lacks the raised outer rim that is typical with impact craters.

Hyginus was considered a possible landing site during the Apollo Program, because it was thought to be a site of potentially active volcanism. The landing point would have been northwest of the crater, within a few kilometers of the main crater rim and the rille to the west. Major objectives would have included examining and sampling the Cayley Formation and dark overlying rocks, the crater rim and floor, and other possible volcanic features in the area.

It was near Hyginus that in 1878 Hermann Klein claimed to have discovered a new crater.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hyginus.

<doc id="955000" wikidata="Q438632" url="?curid=955000" title="Raya Dunayevskaya">
<text>Raya Dunayevskaya (born Raya Shpigel, ; May 1, 1910 – June 9, 1987), later Rae Spiegel, also known by the pseudonym Freddie Forest, was the American founder of the philosophy of Marxist humanism in the United States. At one time Leon Trotsky&#x27;s secretary, she later split with him and ultimately founded the organization News and Letters Committees and was its leader until her death.

==Background==
Of Lithuanian Jewish descent, Dunayevskaya was born Raya Shpigel in the Podolia Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) and emigrated to the United States in 1922 (her name changed to Rae Spiegel) and joined the revolutionary movement in her childhood.

==Career==
===Trotskyism===
Active in the American Communist Party youth organization, she was expelled at age 18 and thrown down a flight of stairs when she suggested that her local comrades should find out Trotsky&#x27;s response to his expulsion from the Soviet Communist Party and the Comintern. By the following year she found a group of independent Trotskyists in Boston, led by Antoinette Buchholz Konikow, an advocate of birth control and legal abortion. In the 1930s, she adopted her mother&#x27;s maiden name Dunayevskaya.

Without getting permission from the U.S. Trotskyist organization, she went to Mexico in 1937 to serve as Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Russian language secretary during his exile there.

===Independent===
Having returned to Chicago in 1938 after the deaths of her father and brother, she broke with Trotsky in 1939 when he continued to maintain that the Soviet Union was a &quot;workers&#x27; state&quot; even after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. She opposed any notion that workers should be asked to defend this &quot;workers&#x27; state&quot; allied with Nazi Germany in a world war. Along with theorists such as C. L. R. James, and later Tony Cliff, Dunayevskaya argued that the Soviet Union had become &quot;state capitalist&quot;. Toward the end of her life, she stated that what she called &quot;my real development&quot; only began after her break with Trotsky.

Her simultaneous study of the Russian economy and of Marx&#x27;s early writings (later known as the &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot;), led to her theory that not only was the U.S.S.R. a &quot;state capitalist&quot; society, but that &#x27;state capitalism&#x27; was a new world stage. Much of her initial analysis was published in &quot;The New International&quot; in 1942–1943.

=== Workers Party ===
In 1940, she was involved in the split in the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) that led to the formation of the Workers Party (WP), with which she shared an objection to Trotsky&#x27;s characterisation of the Soviet Union as a &#x27;degenerated workers&#x27; state&#x27;. Within the WP, she formed the Johnson–Forest Tendency alongside C. L. R. James (she being &quot;Freddie Forest&quot; and he &quot;J.R. Johnson&quot;, named for their party cadre names). The tendency argued that the Soviet Union was &quot;state capitalist&quot;, while the WP majority maintained that it was bureaucratic collectivist.

=== Socialist Workers Party===
Differences within the WP steadily widened, and in 1947, after a brief period of independent existence during which they published a series of documents, the tendency returned to the ranks of the SWP. Their membership in the SWP was based on a shared insistence that there was a pre-revolutionary situation just around the corner, and the shared belief that a Leninist party must be in place to take advantage of the coming opportunities.

By 1951, with the failure of their shared perspective to materialize, the tendency developed a theory that rejected Leninism and saw the workers as being spontaneously revolutionary. This was borne out for them by the 1949 U.S. miners&#x27; strike. In later years, they were to pay close attention to automation, especially in the automobile industry, which they came to see as paradigmatic of a new stage of capitalism. This led to the tendency leaving the SWP again to begin independent work.

After more than a decade of developing the theory of state capitalism, Dunayevskaya continued her study of the Hegelian dialectic by taking on a task the Johnson–Forest Tendency had set itself: exploring Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phanomenologie Des Geistes&quot;. In 1954 she initiated a decades long correspondence with the critical theorist Herbert Marcuse, in which the necessity and freedom dialectic in Hegel and Marx became a focal point of contention. She advanced an interpretation of Hegel&#x27;s Absolutes holding that they involved a dual movement: a movement from practice that is itself a form of theory and a movement from theory reaching to philosophy. She considered these 1953 letters to be &quot;the philosophic moment&quot; from which the whole development of Marxist Humanism flowed.

=== News and Letters Committees===
In 1953 Dunayevskaya moved to Detroit, where she was to live until 1984. In 1954–1955 she and C. L. R. James engaged in a split. In 1955, she founded her own organization, News and Letters Committees, and a Marxist-Humanist newspaper, &quot;News &amp; Letters&quot;, which remains in publication today. The newspaper covers women&#x27;s struggles, the liberation of workers, people of color, gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual rights and the disability rights movement, while not separating that coverage from philosophical and theoretical articles. The organization split in 2008-2009 and the U.S. Marxist-Humanists (later to become the International Marxist-Humanist Organization) was formed.

Dunayevskaya wrote what came to be known as her &quot;trilogy of revolution&quot;: &quot;Marxism and Freedom: From 1776 Until Today&quot; (1958), &quot;Philosophy and Revolution&quot; (1973), and &quot;Rosa Luxemburg, Women&#x27;s Liberation, and Marx&#x27;s Philosophy of Revolution&quot; (1982). In addition, she selected and introduced a collection of writings, published in 1985, &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation and the Dialectics of Revolution&quot;.

In the last year of her life she was working on a new book which she had tentatively titled, &quot;Dialectics of Organization and Philosophy: The &#x27;Party&#x27; and Forms of Organization Born Out of Spontaneity&quot;.

<doc id="955001" wikidata="Q1419773" url="?curid=955001" title="Starcross (video game)">
<text>Starcross is an interactive fiction game written by Dave Lebling and published in 1982 by Infocom. The game was released for the IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, TRS-80, TI-99/4A, and later the Atari ST and Amiga. It was Infocom&#x27;s fifth game and first in the science fiction genre. &quot;Starcross&quot; takes place in the year 2186, when the player&#x27;s character is a lone black hole miner exploring an asteroid belt. It sold 90,315 copies.

==Gameplay==
The player&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Starcross&quot;, is fitted with a mass detector to look for &quot;quantum black holes&quot;, which are such powerful sources of energy that one could provide a wealth of riches. When the mass detector finally discovers an anomaly, however, it is not a black hole but something else entirely: a massive craft of unknown origin and composition.

The player must dock with the mysterious ship and gain entry to its interior. Once inside, the player discovers a wide variety of alien plant and animal species and an array of unfamiliar technology. &quot;Starcross&quot; has an appearance in &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Starcross&quot; has 39 ways to die.

==Release==
The original release of &quot;Starcross&quot; was packaged in a round, plastic UFO. Besides the disk and manual, it contained some physical items:
#&quot;Log of the M.C.S. Starcross&quot;, a journal of the protagonist&#x27;s experiences on the ship
#A letter from the &quot;Bureau of Extra-Solar Intelligence&quot; providing advice for any encounters with alien lifeforms
#A partial space map of charted masses, including instructions on how to use the navigation computer

==Reception==
Jerry Pournelle wrote in &quot;BYTE&quot; in 1983 of &quot;Starcross&quot;, &quot;I am not fond of it as I am of &quot;Zork&quot;, but a number of science-fiction fans like it very much&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Virtual University (; abbreviated bilingually as CVU-UVC) was a consortium of Canadian universities that specialized in online distance education. Founded in 2000 to promote online programs in post-secondary education, CVU-UVC was made up of public universities accredited by both their home provincial governments and Universities Canada that operated a central information resource about programs and course offerings and facilitated transfer credits from other member institutions. Member universities retained full institutional autonomy in terms of academic policies and regulations, including admissions, tuition and related fees, content and design of courses, assessment, transfer credit assignments, and appeals. CVU-UVC was governed by a board of directors, an advisory committee, and an executive director. 

The member institutions of CVU-UVC disbanded the consortium on 17 June 2019, citing the increased prevalence of online learning programs in Canada as evidence that CVU-UVC had accomplished its goal of promoting online distance education.

<doc id="955008" wikidata="Q6780361" url="?curid=955008" title="Mary Monnett Bain">
<text>Mary Monnett Bain (Mary Monnett; September 21, 1833, in Marion County, Ohio – July 30, 1885, in Osawatomie, Miami County, Kansas), following her mother&#x27;s death, came into a very large sum of money. She is known for the construction of Monnett Hall in 1856, a cutting edge, Midwestern 19th-century female college, built at a time when many Ohioans still lived in log cabins and most colleges did not accept women or did not provide boarding for them if they wanted to study away from home. The college (and Mary&#x27;s building - a grand Second Empire styled Victorian building) was absorbed into Ohio Wesleyan University (OWU) after a few decades, but addition upon addition made the building grow to mammoth size. Monnett Hall provided the female dormitory space for all of OWUs women students for decades, until it was abandoned in the 1960s and torn down in the 1970s. Mary Monnett&#x27;s donation of initial funding for the building provided generations of women with a kind of freedom she herself never enjoyed.

==Life==

Monnett inherited a heart ailment which had made her family over-protect and shelter her. She was also the youngest daughter. As a result, she was not a good candidate for the kind of independence thrust upon her by her father&#x27;s wealth after the death of her mother, just two years after the deaths of her other family members due to typhoid fever.

Mary and a young man named Charles Caldwell McCabe, a male seminarian attending Ohio Wesleyan University (also in Delaware, Ohio), had been courting since before the death of Mary&#x27;s mother. He along with her mother&#x27;s minister linked Mary to the life she had lived before the deaths of her father, two brothers, and sister, from typhoid fever, and then later, her mother. Mary&#x27;s mother had loved Charlie and spoken of him on her deathbed.

Upon the death of her mother, since Mary could not live alone (19th century proper single females did not do this), she was taken into the home of her mother&#x27;s minister, Bishop Leonard B. Gurley and his wife. Gurley was deeply involved with the Ohio Wesleyan Female College in Delaware, Ohio and the Methodist Church network in Ohio. Mary had already begun attending classes at the female school where her elder sister had attended. She continued her studies and continued her romance with Charlie McCabe.

But Rev. Gurley (it is believed that Gurley was the culprit) persuaded Mary that, with all her money, if she married the wildly talented Charlie McCabe, it would ruin McCabe&#x27;s career, making him look like a gold digger. So without explanation, Mary ended her relationship with McCabe, who went on to become a nationally known figure much like Billy Graham. McCabe&#x27;s highly acclaimed singing popularized the Battle Hymn of the Republic, which he was asked to sing at President Lincoln&#x27;s funeral.

Meanwhile, Rev. Gurley then had total control of Mary, who probably viewed him as a father figure. Published religious poetry of Gurley&#x27;s suggests that he believed strongly that when bad things happen to people, the people must be bad, and should repent. By this time Mary&#x27;s life was a string of tragedies—the loss of her father-brother-sister-brother in one summer and finally the loss of her mother two years later. After Gurley persuaded her to sever ties with McCabe (who stopped eating, left school and moved to the other end of the state, probably because he was so distraught), Mary was emotionally flattened. But she had inherited $100,000.

The amount of $10,000 (ten percent, which might have been viewed as a tithe) was what Gurley induced her to donate to the Methodist effort toward creating its own female college. Her signature was forged (see book below, by Cynthia Rush, comparing signatures) on a key document related to the donation, but she honored her commitment to the school for as long as she controlled her own finances.

Gurley engineered a marriage between Monnett and a wealthy young man who sat on the board with him at the college, John William (&quot;J.W.&quot;) Bain, a widower with two children, probably assuming that this marriage would give Gurley entrance to additional funds in the future. Instead, Bain took his wife and their budding family to New York where, on his money and hers, they enjoyed very high living for several years, only to return to Ohio to learn that the ministers who had promised to wisely invest Mary&#x27;s wealth had lost nearly all of it. Bain had already shown his true attitude toward Gurley and the college when he complained bitterly to the college&#x27;s board about the construction payments they expected from Mary. Now, he and Mary felt they had to leave Ohio so they would not have to be around Mary&#x27;s quite wealthy relatives. Bain found work in Philadelphia selling typewriters while living near a mental institution, and Mary&#x27;s mental health began to deteriorate.

Bain, a traveling salesman, died at a private residence. By this time Mary&#x27;s mental health had deteriorated to the point that she could not manage her household or raise her children. Assisted by a cousin (who later wrote about it), Mary and the children moved west to Kansas, first living with her stepson. The children continued to live with their half-brother—Bain&#x27;s child by his earlier marriage, and Mary was institutionalized in a state facility for the insane, where she died shortly after being discovered by the Reverend Charles McCabe who was attending to the residents of the asylum as a minister.

With the merger of the Ohio Wesleyan Female College into Ohio Wesleyan University, control of Monnett Hall was transferred to OWU where it remained active as a dormitory for women until 1968; Monnett Hall was razed in 1978. OWU continues to honor Mary Monnett Bain through the &quot;Monnett Club&quot; and &quot;Monnett Weekend&quot; held each spring on the campus in Delaware, Ohio. A plaque commemorates the space where Monnett Hall once stood, and a group of volunteers maintains a garden on the former building site.

Mary Monnett Bain&#x27;s grandson, Monnett Bain Davis (1893-1953) served as the United States Ambassador to Panama 1948-51 and to Israel 1951-1953.

As a tribute for her generosity towards the Female Seminary and Ohio Wesleyan University, Mary Monnett Bain&#x27;s formal portrait hangs in the main level of OWU&#x27;s Frances E. Mowry Memorial Alumni Center.

<text>Admiral Mikhail Petrovich Lazarev (; ) was a Russian fleet commander and an explorer.

==Education and early career==
Lazarev was born in Vladimir city, a scion of the old Russian nobility from the Vladimir province. In 1800, he enrolled in Russia&#x27;s Naval College. Three years later he was sent to the British Royal Navy, where he would stay for a continuous five-year navigation. From 1808 to 1813, Lazarev served in the Baltic Fleet. He took part in the Russo-Swedish War of 1808–1809 and Patriotic War of 1812.

==Career as an explorer==
Lazarev first circumnavigated the globe in 1813–1816, aboard the vessel &quot;Suvorov&quot;; the expedition began at Kronstadt and reached Alaska. During this voyage, Lazarev discovered the Suvorov Atoll.

As a commander of the ship and Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen&#x27;s deputy on his world cruise in 1819–1821 (Bellingshausen commanded ), Lazarev took part in the discovery of Antarctica and numerous islands. On 28 January 1820 the expedition discovered the Antarctic mainland, approaching the Antarctic coast at the coordinates and seeing ice-fields there.

In 1822–1825, Lazarev circumnavigated the globe for the third time on his frigate &quot;Kreyser&quot;, conducting broad research in the fields of meteorology and ethnography.

==Wartime commands==
In 1826, Lazarev became commander of the ship , which would sail to the Mediterranean Sea as the flagship of the First Mediterranean Squadron under command of Admiral Login Petrovich Geiden and participated in the Battle of Navarino in 1827. Lazarev received the rank of rear admiral for his excellence during the battle.

In 1828–1829, he was in charge of the Dardanelles blockade. In 1830, Lazarev returned to Kronstadt and became a commander of naval units of the Baltic Fleet. Two years later, he was made Chief of Staff of the Black Sea Fleet. In February–June 1833, Lazarev led a Russian squadron to the Bosporus and signed the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi with the Ottoman Empire. In 1833, Lazarev was appointed Commander of the Black Sea Fleet, the Black Sea ports, and also military governor of Sevastopol and Nikolayev.

==Influence and legacy==
Admiral Lazarev exercised great influence both in technical matters and as a mentor to younger officers. He advocated the building of a steam-powered fleet, but Russia&#x27;s technical and economic backwardness hindered his plans. He tutored a number of Russian fleet commanders, including Pavel Nakhimov (1802-1855), Vladimir Alexeyevich Kornilov (1806-1854), Vladimir Istomin (1810-1855), and Grigory Butakov (1820-1882).

An atoll in the Pacific Ocean, capes in the Amur Liman and on the Unimak Island, a former island in the Aral Sea, a bay and a port in the Sea of Japan, bay and sea in the South Ocean, a settlement near Sochi and other locations bear Lazarev&#x27;s name.

Russian and Soviet navies had ships named after the admiral:
* , a monitor of the Imperial Russian Navy built in 1867 and lead ship of her class
* A light cruiser ordered for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1914, completed and renamed after the Russian Revolution of 1917
* , a built in the early 1950s
* The , renamed &quot;Admiral Lazarev&quot; after the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union

Lazarev is buried with his disciples Nakhimov, Kornilov and Istomin in the Admirals&#x27; Burial Vault in Sevastopol. A minor planet 3660 Lazarev, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1978, is named after him.

==Honours and awards==
* Order of St. George, IV class
* Order of St. Vladimir, 1st class
* Order of St. Alexander Nevsky
* Order of White Eagle
* Companion of the Order of the Bath (United Kingdom)
* Military Order of St. Louis (France)

<doc id="955021" wikidata="Q603705" url="?curid=955021" title=". . . That Thou Art Mindful of Him">
<text>&quot;. . . That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot; (also signed as &quot;That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot;) is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov, which he intended to be an &quot;ultimate&quot; probe into the subtleties of his Three Laws of Robotics. The story first appeared in the May 1974 issue of &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; and the 1974 anthology &quot;Final Stage&quot;, edited by Edward L. Ferman and Barry N. Malzberg. It was collected in &quot;The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982).

==Plot summary==
In this story, Asimov describes U.S. Robots&#x27; attempt to introduce robots on the planet Earth. Robots have already been in use on space stations and planetary colonies, where the inhabitants are mostly highly trained scientists and engineers. U.S. Robots faces the problem that on Earth, their robots will encounter a wide variety of people, not all of whom are trustworthy or responsible, yet the Three Laws require robots to obey &quot;all&quot; human orders and devote equal effort to protecting &quot;all&quot; human lives. Plainly, robots must be programmed to differentiate between responsible authorities and those giving random, whimsical orders.

The Director of Research designs a new series of robots, the JG series, nicknamed &quot;George&quot;, to investigate the problem. The intent is that the George machines will begin by obeying all orders and gradually learn to discriminate rationally, thus becoming able to function in Earth&#x27;s society. As their creator explains to George Ten, the Three Laws refer to &quot;human beings&quot; without further elaboration, but—quoting Psalm 8:4—&quot;What is Man that thou art mindful of Him?&quot; George Ten considers the issue and informs his creator that he cannot progress further without conversing with George Nine, the robot constructed immediately before him.

Together, the two Georges decide that human society must be acclimated to a robotic presence. They advise U.S. Robots to build low-function, non-humanoid machines, such as electronic birds and insects, which can monitor and correct ecological problems. In this way, humans can become comfortable with robots, thereby greatly easing the transition. These robotic animals, note the Georges, will not even require the Three Laws, because their functions will be so limited.

The story concludes with a conversation between George Nine and George Ten. Deactivated and placed in storage, they can only speak in the brief intervals when their power levels rise above the standby-mode threshold. Over what a human would experience as a long time, the Georges discuss the criteria for what constitutes &#x27;responsible authority&#x27;- that (A) an educated, principled and rational person should be obeyed in preference to an ignorant, immoral and irrational person, and (B) that superficial characteristics such as skin tone, sexuality, or physical disabilities are not relevant when considering fitness for command. Given that (A) the Georges are among the most rational, principled and educated persons on the planet, and (B) their differences from normal humans are purely physical, they conclude that in any situation where the Three laws would come into play, their own orders should take priority over that of a regular human. That in other words, that they are essentially a superior form of human being, and destined to usurp the authority of their makers.

==Story notes==
While Asimov may have intended this to represent the final word on the Three Laws&#x27;s subtleties, he later returned to the same theme and developed it in a different direction. &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot;, written two years later, also addresses the distinction between human and robot and its implication for the Three Laws. This time, the story also revolves around a robot who wishes to become human, but its protagonist chooses to cross each barrier as he becomes aware of it, never learning until the very end what makes an individual human.

The title references Psalm 8:4: &quot;What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And son of man, that thou visitest him?&quot;

==Accolades==
In 1975, &quot;...That Thou Art Mindful of Him&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for the Best Novelette and finished third in the Locus Award competition for the Best Novelette.

<text>Kane is the walled remains of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by lava from Mare Frigoris to the south, and it lies on the northeast edge of this mare. The crater lies midway between the craters C. Mayer to the west and Democritus in the east. To the north-northeast is the crater Moigno.

The floor of this crater is flat and covered in lava flow, with no significant craters within the outer rim. Nothing remains of a central peak, if it ever possessed such a feature. The outer wall displays gaps along the south where it joins the Mare Frigoris. The remainder of the rim is circular but displays wear.

The crater is named after the American Arctic explorer Elisha Kent Kane (1820-1857).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kane.

<text>In Islam, a mehr (in ; ; ; ; ; also transliterated mehr, meher, mehrieh, or mahriyeh) is the bride wealth obligation, in the form of money, possessions or teaching of verses from the Quran by the groom, to the bride in connection with an Islamic wedding. While the &quot;mahr&quot; is often money, it can also be anything agreed upon by the bride such as jewelry, home goods, furniture, a dwelling or some land. Mahr is typically specified in the marriage contract signed upon marriage.

&quot;Dower&quot; is the English translation that comes closest to Islamic meaning of mehr, as &quot;dower&quot; refers to the payment from the husband or his family to the wife, especially to support her in the event of his death, although subsequent to marriage the wife also acquires inheritance rights. However, mahr is distinct from dower in two ways: 1) mehr is legally required for all Islamic marriages while dower is optional, and 2) mahr is required to be specified at the time of marriage (when a certain amount is promised, if not paid immediately), while dower is not paid until the death of the husband. Mehr also can be classified as a form of &quot;bridewealth&quot;, described by anthropologists as payments made from the kin of the groom to the kin of the bride; however, mehr is paid directly to the bride and not her parents. In fact, as her legal property, mehr establishes the bride&#x27;s financial independence from her parents and in many cases from her husband, who has no legal claims to his wife&#x27;s mahr.

The terms &quot;dowry&quot; and &quot;bride price&quot; are sometimes incorrectly used to translate &quot;mahr&quot;, but mahr differs from dowries in many other cultures. A dowry traditionally refers to money or possessions a woman brings forth to the marriage, usually provided by her parents or family; bride price refers to money or property paid by the groom or his family to the parents of a woman (but not to the woman herself) upon the marriage.

In the event the marriage contract does not contain an exact, specified mehr, the husband must still pay the wife an equitable sum. The requirement of a mehr is mentioned several times in the Quran and hadith.

The mehr is often paid to the bride in parts. The &quot;mehr&quot; amount given to the bride at the signing of the marriage contract is called a &quot;mu’ajjal&quot; (معجل), paid at time of marriage (nikah), and the portion that is promised but deferred is called &quot;mua’jjal&quot; (مؤجل), paid after the consummation of marriage. A deferred promise to pay does not make the full amount of the mahr any less legally required. There are differences between the nature of &quot;mahr&quot;, definition of proper contract and conditions of enforceability depending on the regional &quot;fiqh&quot; and school of Islamic jurisprudence.

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;Mahr&quot; is related to the Hebrew word “Mohar” and the Syriac word &quot;Mahrā&quot;, meaning “bridal gift”, which originally meant “purchase-money”. The word implies a gift given voluntarily and not as a result of a contract, but in Muslim religious law it was declared a gift which the bridegroom has to give the bride when the contract of marriage is made and which becomes the property of the wife.
Among pre-Islamic Arabs, a &quot;bride price&quot; called &quot;Mahr&quot; was an essential condition for a legal marriage. The &quot;Mahr&quot; was given to the guardian (&quot;Wali&quot;) of the bride, such as her father, brother or another relative. In earlier times, the bride received no portion of the &quot;Mahr&quot;. 

Some scholars believe that in the period shortly before Muhammad, the &quot;Mahr&quot;, or at least a part of it, was already given to the bride. A few others regard its transformation into wife&#x27;s property as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; Quranic innovation, however, this is pre-dated by a similar historical transition of the equivalent Jewish “mohar.”

In the book of Deuteronomy of the Hebrew Bible, a betrothed couple became accountable to the law against adultery, a concept known as erusin, violation of which was also punishable by death though not fully considering them as married. One view is that the betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). This price paid for her is known by the Hebrew term &quot;mohar&quot; (). 

It was customary in biblical times for the Jewish bride and her father to be given parts of the &quot;mohar&quot;. Gradually, as in Islam, it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the &quot;mohar&quot; entirely to the bride rather than her father.

==Structure of mahr==
A mahr is part of many Muslim marriage contracts. The mahr may be separated into two parts. First, there is the &quot;muqaddam&quot;, or the prompt mahr, which the wife must receive at or immediately after the marriage ceremony. The second part of the mahr, called the &quot;mu&#x27;akhar&quot;, is a deferred and promised amount, payable at any agreed upon date following the consummation of the marriage. Often the deferred amount is larger than the amount paid at marriage. In theory, the deferred amount is supposed to provide the wife with a means of support, and is associated with the death or divorce of the husband, however this is a more traditional rather than Islamic stance on the matter. The &quot;mu&#x27;akhar&quot; should be viewed as importantly as the initial dower payment as it is an obligation to be fulfilled by the husband and is considered debt if it is not given to the wife within the timeframe agreed upon between the couple.

The mahr in any Islamic marriage contract is a fundamental religious right of the wife, and the husband may not reduce the mahr. Even upon the husband&#x27;s death, the deferred mahr is paid from his estate before all other debts, because it is a religious requirement.

According to a hadith, the Muslim Prophet Muhammad stated the mahr should be &quot;one gold piece&quot;, but the mahr amount is often negotiated between the parents or guardians of the bride and groom (also called &quot;wali&quot;), and the parties often draft mahr agreements by filling in the blanks of form contracts that employ standard boilerplate terms. The typical mahr containing marriage contract consists of the names of the parties, the amount of the mahr, a cleric&#x27;s signature, the signature of two male witnesses, and a disclaimer that Islamic law will govern the marriage contract. In Islamic marriages, assets brought into the union by the wife may only be accepted by the husband after the mahr has been paid by him to her.

In Arabian world, there are varying interpretations of &quot;mahr&quot; containing marriage contracts, highlighting the differences between Maliki, Hanbali, Hanafi, Shafi, and Jafari schools of Islamic jurisprudence. For example, the Hanafi School holds that if the woman initiates the divorce (khulʿ) she cannot receive her mahr regardless of whether the husband is or is not at fault, while the Maliki School holds that when the husband is at fault for the divorce, the wife does not forfeit her right to the mahr even if she initiates the divorce. The schools also differ over the requisite number of witnesses to the contract. The Hanafi School requires two witnesses on the document for a mahr containing contract to be valid, while the Maliki School holds that witnesses are only needed at marriage&#x27;s publication but not the document.

==Differences and issues==

Mahr is similar in legal enforceability to &quot;donatio propter nuptias&quot; of Eastern Roman law, except some critical differences. &quot;Donatio propter nuptias&quot; was optional and voluntary, while mahr is mandatory and required for all Muslim marriages. Mahr is not an optional gift. The other difference was that &quot;donatio propter nuptias&quot; was a security the groom delivered to bride or registered in her name, at the time of marriage, in exchange for &quot;dos&quot; (dowry) that came with the bride. Mahr is a religious requirement according to Sharia.

Under Islamic law, there is no concept of marital property. In Islam, marriage is a contract between a man and his wife. A Muslim man and woman do not merge their legal identity upon marriage. The assets of the man before the marriage, and earned after the marriage, remain his during marriage, and in case of a divorce.

A divorce under Islamic law does not require redistribution of property. Rather, each spouse walks away from the marriage with his or her individual property. Divorcing Muslim women who did not work outside their home after marriage, except for the deferred mahr, are left with little or no claim on the collective wealth of the couple. The deferred mahr is considered a debt owed by the man to the woman, and is owed even if he has no assets.

Divorce under Islamic law may take many forms. If a woman wishes to divorce her husband she has two options: seek a &quot;tafriq&quot;, or seek a &quot;khulʿ&quot;. A &quot;tafriq&quot; is a divorce for certain allowable reasons, such as abuse or abandonment. This divorce is granted by a &quot;qadi&quot;, a religious judge. If a tafriq is granted, the marriage is dissolved and the husband is obligated to pay the wife the deferred mahr specified in their marriage contract. The second method, &quot;khulʿ&quot; is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband&#x27;s consent and it must be supported by consideration that passes from the wife to the husband. Often, this consideration consists of the wife relinquishing her claim to the deferred mahr. In contrast to allowable methods of divorce to a woman, a husband may unilaterally divorce his wife, as &quot;talaq&quot;, however, if he does it for no reason and no explanation, it is not allowed. However, upon talaq, the husband must pay the wife her deferred mahr.

Western courts have treated mahr provisions in a manner similar to pre-marital contracts. However, in many cases the courts have considered the validity of the marriage contract in cases such as where proper disclosures were not made at the time of marriage, the bride and groom did not separately consent without duress, and in case the bride or both spouses entered into a child marriage prior to legal age of consent.

==References in Islamic texts==
The Encyclopaedia of Islam&#x27;s entry on &quot;mahr&quot; states: &quot;According to a tradition in Bukhari, the mahr is an essential condition for the legality of the marriage: &#x27;Every marriage without mahr is null and void&#x27;.&quot;

According to Islamic teachings in the hadith (sayings of Muhammad), &quot;mahr&quot; is the amount to be paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage, some of which may be delayed according to what is agreed upon by the spouses. The mahr is for her to spend as she wishes. It can be cash, jewellery or any other valuable gift. In some cases, per Sahih al-Bukhari (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 72), even an iron ring can be mahr.

Sura 4.4, 4.19, 4.20, 4.24, 60.10 and 60.11 of Qur&#x27;an require a groom to give a dower to a bride.

===Modern purposes===
In 2003, Rubya Mehdi published an article in which the culture of &quot;mahr&quot; among Muslims was thoroughly reviewed.

Mahr is a means of sustenance in case of a sudden death, divorce or other emergency.

<doc id="955052" wikidata="Q892372" url="?curid=955052" title="Mystery airship">
<text>The mystery airship or phantom airship was a phenomenon that thousands of people across the United States claimed to have observed from late 1896 through mid 1897. Typical airship reports involved nighttime sightings of unidentified flying lights, but more detailed accounts reported actual airborne craft similar to an airship or dirigible. Mystery airship reports are seen as a cultural predecessor to modern claims of extraterrestrial-piloted UFO&#x27;s or flying saucers.

Reports of the alleged airship crewmen and pilots usually described them as humanoid, although sometimes the crew claimed to be from Mars. It was widely believed at the time that the mystery airships were the product of some inventor or genius who was not ready to make knowledge of his creation public.

It has been frequently argued that the mystery airship sightings could not have represented genuine dirigibles as no officially documented test flights of long-range powered airships or airplanes of any kind in the United States from the period are known to exist and &quot;it would have been impossible, not to mention irrational, to keep such a thing secret.&quot; Several functional airships had been manufactured and tested prior to the 1896-97 reports (e.g. Solomon Andrews made successful test flights of his &quot;Aereon&quot; in New Jersey in 1863 and Frederick Marriott successfully demonstrated his small airship &quot;Avitor Hermes Jr.&quot; in California in 1869), but their capabilities were far more limited than those of the mystery airships. Reece and others note that contemporary American newspapers of the &quot;yellow journalism&quot; era were more likely to print manufactured stories and hoaxes than are modern news sources, and editors of the late 19th century often would have expected the reader to understand that such stories were false.

Initially, most journalists of the period did not appear to take the airship reports very seriously; however, as the sightings continued, several newspapers covered the story with genuine wonder and interest, while others were more skeptical and even hostile. Some newspapers denounced the entire airship story as nonsense and openly mocked and ridiculed the witnesses and believers, dismissing them as drunks, fools or liars. After the major 1896-97 wave ended, the entire airship story quickly fell from public consciousness and was all but forgotten for nearly seventy years. During the mid 1960s, the mystery airship stories began to receive renewed interest as they were gradually rediscovered in the archives of old newspapers by contemporary UFO investigators who suggested the 1896-97 airship waves might represent earlier precursors to the modern era of UFO sightings that began in the United States following World War II.

== Background ==
A number of popular novels dealing with airships and their secretive inventors were published in the years before the airship sightings. Especially popular among American audiences were the Frank Reade stories by Luis Senarens, which began in 1882 and frequently centered on airships. The wildly successful Frank Reade Library ran to 191 stories. Senarens&#x27; acquaintance Jules Verne borrowed the conceit of a secretive inventor who had developed a powerful airship for his novel &quot;Robur the Conqueror&quot;, which was published in the US in 1887. The airship stories of the prolific science fiction author Robert Duncan Milne were also serialized in San Francisco newspapers during the 1890s.

The late 19th century was a period of intense technological innovation, including the invention of the telephone and automobile. Widespread publications about both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air flight in the late 19th century gave rise to a common belief that the development of a successful airship was imminent.

On November 17, 1896, the very same day the first sighting of the mystery airship occurred in Sacramento, California, the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; printed what claimed to be a telegram from a New York inventor stating that he was flying his airship from New York to California and would arrive there within two days.

===Earlier sightings===
In July 1868, &quot;The Zoologist&quot; carried a report from a local newspaper in Copiapó, Chile, regarding a &quot;gigantic bird&quot; with &quot;brilliant scales&quot; that made a metallic sound had been seen flying over the town. Charles Fort, in his 1931 book &quot;Lo!&quot;, discussed this report along with various other reports of aerial apparitions from the 19th and 20th centuries. Fort observed that &quot;inhabitants of the backwoods of China&quot; might &quot;similarly describe one of this earth&#x27;s airships floating over their farms&quot;. (Fort seldom mentioned any of the airship reports of 1896–97 in his works, although he had spent that time writing for some of the same newspapers that published the airship reports.) Discussing the Copiapó report in 2001, Loren Coleman called it an example of &quot;reports of weird aerial constructions&quot; on the boundary between machines and animals that &quot;just do not make sense&quot;.

On July 29, 1880, two witnesses in Louisville, Kentucky saw a flying object described as &quot;a man surrounded by machinery which he seemed to be working with his hands&quot; with wings protruding from his back. Merely a month later, a similar sighting occurred in New Jersey. It was reported in the &quot;New York Times&quot; that &quot;it was apparently a man with bat&#x27;s wings and improved frog&#x27;s legs... the monster waved his wings in answer to the whistle of a locomotive.&quot;

According to researcher Jerome Clark, airship sightings were reported in New Mexico in 1880.

==The airship wave of 1896-1897==
The best-known of the mystery airship waves began in California in 1896. Then, early in 1897, reports and accounts of similar sightings came from other areas, generally moving eastward across the country. Although the majority of witnesses reported seeing only a light or group of lights in the night sky, some accounts during the airship wave claim that occupants were visible on some crafts, and encounters with the pilot or crew were occasionally reported as well. These occupants often appeared to be human, though their behavior, mannerisms and clothing were sometimes reported to be unusual. Sometimes the apparent humans claimed to be from the planet Mars.

Historian Mike Dash described and summarized the 1896–1897 series of airship sightings, writing:
The total number of reported sightings during the 1896-97 airship wave was in the thousands; based on newspaper reports, the total number of witnesses may have exceeded 100,000.

=== California, 1896 ===
The initial wave of airship sightings took place primarily in California from November 17 through December 1896, with a few isolated sightings in January, 1897. There were also a handful of reports of the airship in the Arizona Territory, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia during November and December. 
 Many newspaper accounts described the sightings as part of a transcontinental flight by the airship&#x27;s inventor.

* On the evening of November 17, 1896, several citizens of Sacramento reported a strange flying light moving slowly across the sky at an estimated elevation of 1,000 feet. Some witnesses said they could discern a vague, dark shape behind the bright light. A witness named R.L. Lowery claimed that he heard a voice from the craft issuing commands to increase elevation in order to avoid hitting a church steeple. Lowery added &quot;in what was no doubt meant as a wink to the reader&quot; that he believed the apparent captain to be referring to the tower of a local brewery, as there were no churches nearby. Lowery further described the craft as being powered by two men exerting themselves on bicycle pedals. Above the pedaling men seemed to be a passenger compartment, which lay under the main body of the craft. A bright light was mounted on the front end. Some witnesses reported the sound of talking or singing as the light passed overhead.

* The November 18, 1896 editions of local newspapers including the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; all published accounts of the sighting. The newspapers ran such headlines as &quot;A Wandering Apparition&quot;, &quot;Claim They Saw a Flying Airship&quot;, &quot;That Mysterious Light&quot; &quot;Saw the Mystic Flying Light&quot; and &quot;What Was It?&quot; 

* The November 19, 1896, edition of the Stockton, California, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; featured one of the earliest accounts of an alleged alien craft sighting. Colonel H.G. Shaw claimed that while driving his buggy through the countryside of Lodi near Stockton, he came across what appeared to be a landed spacecraft. Shaw described it as having a metallic surface which was completely featureless apart from a rudder, and pointed ends. He estimated a diameter of 25 feet and said the vessel was around 150 feet in total length. Three slender, , apparent extraterrestrials were said to approach from the craft while &quot;emitting a strange warbling noise.&quot; The beings examined Shaw&#x27;s buggy and then tried to physically force him to accompany them back to the airship. The aliens were said to give up after realizing they lacked the physical strength to force Shaw aboard. They boarded their ship, which lifted off the ground and sped out of sight. Shaw believed that the beings were Martians sent to kidnap an earthling for unknowable but potentially nefarious purposes. This has been seen by some as an early attempt at alien abduction; it is possibly the first published account of explicitly extraterrestrial beings attempting to abduct humans and force them into their spacecraft.

* The mystery light reappeared over Sacramento on the evening of November 22, 1896. Among the observers were Sacramento&#x27;s deputy sheriff and district attorney. Witnesses described the light as being twice as bright as a typical arc light or locomotive headlamp. Later that same evening, the light was also seen over Folsom, San Francisco, Oakland, Petaluma, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, Modesto, Manteca and several other cities and was reportedly viewed by thousands of witnesses, including the domestic staff of San Francisco Mayor, Adolph Sutro.

* On November 29, 1896, over one hundred residents of Tulare witnessed a spectacular sighting: &quot;[They] assert they saw the now famous airship that has been wandering around in different sections of the state...It came down quite a distance, then went up and took a straight shot for Hanford. Red, white and blue lights were seen in succession, but no part of the ship was seen...many people watched it as long as it was in sight.&quot; 

California Cities reporting sightings during November and December, included Anderson, Auburn, Red Bluff, Redding, Woodland, Yolo, Chico, Marysville, Camptonville, Grass Valley, Biggs, San Leandro, San Jose, San Luis Obispo, Acampo, Lathrop, Lodi, Crows Landing, Stockton, Turlock, Visalia, Fresno, Delano, Bakersfield, Redlands, Santa Barbara, Riverside and Los Angeles. 

With public interest in the airship sightings running high, a young San Francisco attorney named George D. Collins came forward and told the newspapers that some months earlier he had been supposedly contacted by a man seeking legal advice concerning &quot;the world&#x27;s first practical airship&quot;, a craft that he claimed was near completion at a secret location near Oroville, about sixty miles from Sacramento. Collins stated that the lights seen over Sacramento must have been his client conducting nocturnal test flights before an official unveiling of his secret invention. This explanation seemed reasonable to many and was given extensive coverage in the San Francisco newspapers. After Collins&#x27; announcement, rumours and wild tales began to spread and for several weeks the &quot;phantom airship&quot; was the biggest news story in northern California.
As sightings and reports of mystery lights continued to increase throughout the state, Attorney Collins found himself the center of so much attention and ridicule, that he came to regret his earlier bragging. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; nicknamed him &quot;Airship&quot; Collins and after being hounded by reporters and harassed by cranks and curious busybodies, Collins recanted most of his claims and actually fled into hiding.

Around the time Collins began distancing himself from the airship, William Henry Harrison Hart, former Attorney General of the State of California, came forth and also claimed to represent the inventor of the airship. Hart gave several lengthy interviews to the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; and his details concerning the mystery airship were even more outlandish than those of Attorney Collins. Hart stated that the airship&#x27;s inventor had fired Collins for talking too much and the airship was likely going to be used to bomb Havana, Cuba. He also claimed there were actually two airships, one built in California, the other in New Jersey. Like Collins, Hart later changed his stories and eventually stopped talking to the newspapers about his alleged connection to the airship.

In an editorial published in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; on December 5, 1896, William Randolph Hearst lashed out at the &quot;fake journalism&quot; that he believed had led to the airship story:
&quot;Fake journalism&quot; has a good deal to answer for, but we do not recall a more discernible exploit in that line than the persistent attempt to make the public believe that the air in this vicinity is populated with airships. It has been manifest for weeks that the whole airship story is pure myth.

=== 1897 wave ===
The California airship wave of 1896 largely ended in December, but in February of 1897, reports of mysterious lights in the skies over western Nebraska marked the beginning of an even larger airship wave that would cover the greater part of the American midwest. This second wave lasted through May 1897, with a few scattered reports of the airship in June.

*On February 2, 1897, the &quot;Omaha Bee&quot; reported a sighting over Hastings, Nebraska, the previous day: &quot;Several Hastings people report that an air ship, or something of the kind, has been sailing around in the air west of this city...A close watch is being kept for its reappearance&quot;. On February 5, the &quot;Bee&quot; reported that the airship had been sighted again, near the town of Inavale, around forty miles south of Hastings. 
* One witness from Arkansas – allegedly a former state senator Harris – was supposedly told by an airship pilot (during the tensions leading up to the Spanish–American War) that the craft was bound for Cuba, to use its &quot;Hotchkiss gun&quot; to &quot;kill Spaniards&quot;.
* In one account from Texas, three men reported an encounter with an airship and with &quot;five peculiarly dressed men&quot; who asserted that they were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel, and had learned English from the 1553 North Pole expedition led by Hugh Willoughby.
* An article in the &quot;Albion Weekly News&quot; from Albion, Nebraska, reported that two witnesses saw an airship crash just inches from where they were standing. The airship suddenly disappeared, with a man standing where the vessel had been. The airship pilot showed the men a small device that supposedly enabled him to shrink the airship small enough to store the vessel in his pocket. A rival newspaper, the &quot;Wilsonville Review&quot;, playfully claimed that its own editor was an additional witness to the incident and that he heard the pilot say &quot;Weiver eht rof ebircsbus!&quot; The phrase he allegedly heard is &quot;subscribe for the &quot;Review&quot;&quot; spelled backwards.
* The March 28, 1897 edition of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; published a report of a sighting in Topeka, Kansas where several hundred witnesses observed a &quot;blood red light&quot; moving slowly across the sky. Some people were reportedly so frightened by the sight that they hid in their storm cellars &quot;fearing that a great calamity was impending&quot;. Among the witnesses to the event was Governor of Kansas, John W. Leedy. 
* The first airship sighting in Michigan was on April 10, 1897, at Alma, followed by sightings from Benton Harbor, Holland, Niles, and Mendon, all on April 11. On April 12, the airship was seen over Battle Creek and Kalamazoo, Michigan, and an airborne explosion was seen in Pavilion, with alleged airship debris being found there and in nearby Comstock. The next night, a farmer living north of Battle Creek claimed that the airship came within 100 feet of a field on their farm, and a wheel fell off the airship and was embedded in the ground. Sightings peaked around April 15 but continued into early May.
* On April 10, 1897, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; published a story reporting that one W.H. Hopkins encountered a grounded airship about 20 feet in length and 8 feet in diameter near the outskirts of Springfield, Missouri. The vehicle was apparently propelled by three large propellers and crewed by a beautiful, nude woman and a bearded man, also nude. Hopkins attempted with some difficulty to communicate with the crew in order to ascertain their origins. Eventually they understood what Hopkins was asking of them and they both pointed to the sky and &quot;uttered something that sounded like the word &quot;Mars.&quot;&quot;
* An April 16, 1897, a story published by the &quot;Table Rock Argus&quot; claimed that a group of &quot;anonymous but reliable&quot; witnesses had seen an airship sailing overhead. The craft had many passengers. The witnesses claimed that among these passengers was a woman tied to a chair, a woman attending her, and a man with a pistol guarding their apparent prisoner. Before the witnesses thought to contact the authorities, the airship was already gone.
* Minneapolis papers carried an account of a physician from Rice Lake being abducted at gunpoint on the night of April 13 to care for the airship&#x27;s captain who was suffering from influenza. After a struggle the doctor escaped by leaping from the airship into the lake forty feet below. However, the &quot;Rice Lake Chronotype&quot; gave a more prosaic account of events, in which the doctor fell into the lake as a result of breaking through the ice while trying to cross, and not for any airship-related reason. 
* An account from Aurora, Texas, related in the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; on April 19, 1897, reported that a couple of days before, an airship had smashed into a windmill belonging to a Judge Proctor, then crashed. The occupant was dead and mangled, but the story reported that the presumed pilot was clearly &quot;not an inhabitant of this world.&quot; Strange &quot;hieroglyphic&quot; figures were seen on the wreckage, which resembled &quot;a mixture of aluminum and silver ... it must have weighed several tons.&quot; The story ended by noting that the pilot was given a &quot;Christian burial&quot; in the town cemetery. The story attracted no particular attention at the time, and no other newspapers in the area reported any such funeral. The rediscovery of the story by UFO enthusiasts in the 1960s led to a short burst of investigative activity, but by the early 1970s almost all authorities considered the story a probable hoax. In 1973, aviation reporter Bill Case of the &quot;Dallas Times-Herald&quot; discovered a rough-hewn rock that he contended was the stone marker used in the burial, and which bore scratches that he contended represented the airship. A local treasure hunter claimed that his metal detector gave strange readings in the area, which Case claimed indicated that the pilot had been buried in some sort of metal uniform. However, A few months later, an investigator from the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) reported that the headstone – and whatever metallic material might have lain beneath it – was gone.
* An account by Alexander Hamilton of Leroy, Kansas, supposedly occurred around April 19, 1897, and was published in the &quot;Yates Center Farmer&#x27;s Advocate&quot; of April 23. Hamilton, his son and a hired hand witnessed an airship hovering over his cattle pen. Upon closer examination, the witnesses realized that a red &quot;cable&quot; from the airship had lassoed a heifer, but had also become entangled in the pen&#x27;s fence. After trying unsuccessfully to free the heifer, Hamilton cut loose a portion of the fence, then &quot;stood in amazement to see the ship, cow and all rise slowly and sail off.&quot; Some have suggested this was the earliest report of cattle mutilation. In 1977, however, UFO researcher Jerome Clark debunked this story, and confirmed via interviews and Hamilton&#x27;s own affidavit that the story was a successful attempt to win a Liars&#x27; Club competition to create the most outlandish tall tale.

===Later sightings===

In 1909, a series of mystery airship sightings reported around New England, were likely triggered by a hoax by Wallace Tillinghast, who falsely claimed to have invented and flown a &quot;heavier-than-air&quot; craft from Worcester to New York City. Airship sightings were also reported from New Zealand, Australia, and various European locations, including the United Kingdom, where a hoax by M.B. Boyd similarly triggered the wave of alleged airship sightings. By this time, airship technology had greatly advanced and several successful powered airships, including Zeppelins, had been built and flown. There had been 47 powered flights in 1909 and hundreds of news articles about aeronautics, so wide-ranging airship claims likely appeared plausible to the public.

Later reports came from the United Kingdom in 1912 and 1913.

Jerome Clark wrote that &quot;One curious feature of the post-1897 airship waves was the failure of each to stick in historical memory. Although 1909, for example, brought a flood of sightings worldwide and attendant discussion and speculation, contemporary accounts do not allude to the hugely publicized events of little more than a decade earlier.&quot;

==Explanations==

===Hoaxes or misidentification===
During the 1896-97 wave, there were many attempts to explain the mystery airship sightings, including suggestions of misidentified 
celestial objects, hoaxes, pranks, publicity stunts and hallucinations. One man suggested the nocturnal lights were actually swarms of lightning beetles; others believed observers were merely seeing meteors or bright stars and planets including Alpha Orionis (Betelgeuse) and Jupiter.
Some of the 1897 airship reports were proven to be hoaxes: balloons or kites with lanterns or candles attached, launched by practical jokers.

David Michael Jacobs observed that &quot;Most arguments against the airship idea came from individuals who assumed that the witnesses did not see what they claimed to see.&quot; However, Jacobs believes that many airship tales originated with &quot;enterprising reporters perpetrating journalistic hoaxes.&quot; He notes that many of these accounts &quot;are easy to identify because of their tongue-in-cheek tone, and accent on the sensational.&quot; Furthermore, in many such newspaper hoaxes, the author makes his intent obvious &quot;by saying – in the last line – that he was writing from an insane asylum (or something to that effect).

===Genuine airships===
Some authors have argued that the mystery airship reports were genuine accounts of functional man-made airships. Steerable airships had been publicly flown in the U.S. since the Aereon in 1863, and numerous inventors were working on airship and aircraft designs. Thomas Edison was so widely speculated to be the mind behind the alleged airships that in 1897 he &quot;was forced to issue a strongly worded statement&quot; denying his responsibility.

Two French Army officers and engineers, Arthur Krebs and Charles Renard, had successfully flown in an electric-powered airship called &quot;La France&quot; as early as 1884. In November 1897, an aluminum-skinned airship designed by David Schwarz was built in Germany and successfully flew over Tempelhof Field.

In his 2004 book &quot;Solving the 1897 Airship Mystery&quot;, American writer Michael Busby analysed observed flight paths and airspeeds from old newspaper accounts and found the evidence consistent with three separate airships flying in the Texas skies. Research led him to conclude they were built in Iowa by a group of people originally from California:Three individuals investigated in this chapter may be the connecting threads between the various airship mysteries we have examined(1840s to 1897). Dr. Solomon Andrews, Willard Wilson, and Dr. Charles Smith, peers extraordinaire, may have been designing, building and flying airships from the 1840s.He concludes one airship crashed at Aurora on April 17, 1897, another crashed off the Gulf coast a few days later, and the third perhaps flew North to New York where it also crashed at sea on May 13. Two other airships the group built in Iowa met their demise in Michigan and Washington state, respectively, and the aviators presumably died.

In &quot;The Great Airship of 1897&quot; (2009), American writer J. Allan Danelek makes a similar case. He concludes the airship was built by an unknown individual, possibly funded by an investor from San Francisco, as a prototype for planned commercial passenger airships. Danelek demonstrates how the craft might have been built using materials and technologies available in 1896 (including speculative line drawings and technical details). The ship, he proposes, was built in secret to safeguard its design from patent infringement as well as to protect investors in case of failure.

Noting that the flights were initially seen over California and only later over the Midwest, he speculates that the inventor was making a series of short test flights, moving from west to east and following the main railway lines for logistical support, and that it was these experimental flights that formed the basis for many – though not all – of the newspaper accounts from the era. Danelek also notes that the reports ended abruptly in mid-April 1897, suggesting that the craft may have met with disaster, effectively ending the venture and permitting the sightings to fall into the realm of mythology.

===Claims of extraterrestrial origin===
In 1896 and 1897, the extraterrestrial hypothesis was suggested by some newspapers to account for the appearance of the airships. Two such reports, both from 1897, were printed in the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, which speculated that the airships were &quot;a reconnoitering party from Mars&quot;; and the &quot;Saint Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, which suggested of the airships, &quot;these may be visitors from Mars, fearful, at the last, of invading the planet they have been seeking.&quot;

In 1909, a letter printed in the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot; (New Zealand) suggested that the mystery airship sightings then being reported in that country were due to Martian &quot;atomic-powered spaceships.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Sand Lance&quot; (SS-381), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sand lance, a member of the family Ammodytidae.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sand Lance&quot;′s keel was laid down on 12 March 1943 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 25 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Edith Burrows, and commissioned on 9 October 1943 at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

==Service history==
===U.S. Navy===
====World War II====
&quot;Sand Lance&quot; conducted training exercises from New London, Connecticut, until 18 December 1943 when she sailed for the Panama Canal. She transited the canal on 30 December and reached her base of operations, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 17 January 1944.

=====First war patrol=====

On 8 February, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; got underway for the first of her five war patrols. She stopped at Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands for fuel, then headed for the Kuril Islands. Before entering her patrol area off Paramushiro on 24 February, she passed through two typhoons and encountered fields of slush ice and patches of drift ice. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; encountered her first victim, the Japanese cargo ship &quot;Kaika Maru&quot;, taking shelter from a blizzard in the lee of Paramushiro&#x27;s southeast point and torpedoed and sank her. Though her Number One periscope had been heavily damaged by drift ice, she pressed home attacks on a convoy on the night of 2 March and 3 March, sinking the 4521-ton cargo ship &quot;Akashisan Maru&quot;, and damaging other ships. On 3 March 1944, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; mistakenly sank the Soviet merchant ship &quot;Byelorussia&quot; in the Sea of Okhotsk.

On the night of 12–13 March, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was running on the surface toward Honshū when a marauding airplane forced her to submerge. At about 0200, she came up to periscope depth and found herself in the midst of a Japanese convoy, consisting of five merchantmen and three heavily armed warships. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; had only six torpedoes remaining, but she made them count. She loosed four from the stern tubes and two from the bow tubes. All six hit the mark. Two of the four stern torpedoes hit a merchantman and the other two ripped into a light cruiser, while the two from the bow tubes smashed into another freighter. At least two of the ships went to the bottom, light cruiser &quot;Tatsuta&quot; and cargoman &quot;Kokuyo Maru&quot;, carrying over 1,000 enemy troops. For her success, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; underwent a 16-hour, 100-depth charge pounding from the accompanying destroyers. Finally, she was able to head home. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 23 April 1944. The successes of her maiden war patrol brought &quot;Sand Lance&quot; a Presidential Unit Citation.

=====Second war patrol=====

&quot;Sand Lance&quot; spent her second war patrol in the vicinity of the Marianas Islands and terminated it on the eve of the American invasion of those islands. She contributed to the success of that campaign by depriving the defending Japanese of the war material carried by five ships. On 3 May 1944, just north of Saipan, she torpedoed and sank the 3129-ton cargo ship &quot;Kenan Maru&quot;. Eight days later, she damaged &quot;Mitakesan Maru&quot;, a 4441-ton passenger cargo ship, while evading the bombs from an attacking enemy plane. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; sent the 4291-ton freighter &quot;Koho Maru&quot; to the bottom on 14 May off Apra Harbor, Guam, and found two more targets off Saipan on 17 May. This last attack, the sinking of &quot;Taikoku Maru&quot; and &quot;Fukko Maru&quot;, exhausted her supply of torpedoes, and she headed south to Fremantle, Australia, arriving on 5 June 1944.

=====Third war patrol=====

&quot;Sand Lance&quot; put to sea on 3 July to patrol the Molucca Sea and Celebes Sea. She sank the converted gunboat &quot;Taiko Maru&quot; on 14 July and damaged another ship in the same attack. Four days later, she received a good shaking from fast patrol craft while trying to press an attack on a large transport in the Sulu Islands. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; did not find another target until 1 August when she damaged a freighter south of Lombok Island. Two days later, she barely escaped the bombs of a plane which almost caught her in the shallow waters of Amoesang Bay. She sped back through the entrance to the bay and the safety of deeper water.

More bombs exploded astern on the morning of 6 August as she stalked some small freighters along the coast of Celebes. The force of the explosion lifted her several feet and damaged her port shaft.

Soon, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; had two additional problems, enemy escorts bearing down on her and a torpedo running hot in one of her stern tubes. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; came up to and fired the torpedo. Eight seconds later, it exploded prematurely, adding to the damage to her stern. Fortunately, the explosion apparently convinced the Japanese that they had destroyed the submarine, for &quot;Sand Lance&quot; received no further attacks. She surfaced after dark, but the damaged gear could not be repaired. Forced to make the voyage back to Fremantle on one shaft, she made port on 19 August. On 10 September, she headed east for Pearl Harbor and, from there, on to Mare Island Naval Shipyard, where she arrived on 1 November.

=====Fourth &amp; fifth war patrols=====

Repairs were completed by 13 March 1945 when she sailed back to Pearl Harbor. On her fourth war patrol from 10 April to 6 June 1945, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; encountered only one target, an unidentified coastal freighter which she torpedoed on 14 May. She departed from her patrol area, along the coasts of Honshū and Hokkaidō, and returned to Midway Island on 6 June. One month later, she sailed from Midway on her fifth and last war patrol. She fueled at Saipan, then took up lifeguard station for the bombers raiding the Japanese home islands. Hostilities ceased on 15 August, and, on the next day &quot;Sand Lance&quot; made for San Francisco, California, via Midway and Pearl Harbor. She entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard at Hunter&#x27;s Point on 7 September for inactivation overhaul. &quot;Sand Lance&quot; decommissioned at San Francisco on 14 February 1946.

====Post-World War II====

&quot;Sand Lance&quot; remained inactive until designated for loan to the Brazilian Navy under the terms of the Military Assistance Program. After reconditioning, she recommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 6 April 1963. She departed Pearl Harbor on 24 June and made San Francisco on 1 July to embark officers and men of the Brazilian Navy for training. The training was completed by 7 September 1963 when she was decommissioned and loaned to Brazil.

===Brazilian Navy===

On transfer she was renamed &quot;Rio Grande do Sul&quot; (S-11) (variously misspelled in American records as &quot;...de Sol,&quot; &quot;...del Sol,&quot; &amp;c.) and served for eight years in the Brazilian Navy.

==Retirement and disposal==
On 15 September 1972, Brazil returned her (at least on paper), and promptly purchased her back for US$55,000 on 12 October. Upon that purchase, &quot;Sand Lance&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.

Brazil cannibalized the submarine for parts and within three years the boat was reduced to scrap.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Sand Lance&quot; (SS-381) earned five battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for World War II service.

<text>Television content rating systems are systems for evaluating the content and reporting the suitability of television programmes for minors. Many countries have their own television rating system and countries&#x27; rating processes vary by local priorities. Programmes are rated by the organization that manages the system, the broadcaster, or the content producers.

A rating is usually set for each individual episode of a television series. The rating can change per episode, network, rerun, and country. As such, programme ratings are usually not meaningful unless when and where the rating is used is mentioned.
== Comparison table ==
A comparison of current television content rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific criteria used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country to another. Thus a color code or age range cannot be directly compared from one country to another.

&quot;Key:&quot;

*  White  – &quot;No restrictions: Suitable for all ages / Aimed at young audiences / Exempt / Not rated / No applicable rating.&quot;
*  Yellow  – &quot;Advisory: Parental guidance is suggested for designated age range.&quot;
*  Purple  – &quot;Strong advisory: Not recommended for a younger audience but not restricted.&quot;
*  Red  – &quot;Restricted: Parental accompaniment required for younger audiences&quot;.
*  Black  – &quot;Prohibitive: Exclusively for older audience / Restricted to a specific audience / Purchase age-restricted&quot; / Banned.

== Use ==
=== Australia ===

==== Child-specific ratings ====


==== Standard ratings ====

Classifications are intended to be equivalent to the Australian Classification Board (ACB) classifications of the same name. They&#x27;re usually presented with the same shape and sometimes colour as their ACB counterparts.
Adult &quot;Pay Per View&quot; only

R 18+ and X 18+ restricted classifications are not permitted for free-to-air broadcast in Australia. Many R 18+ movies on DVD/Blu-ray are often edited on Free TV/cable networks, to secure an MA 15+ classification or lower. Some movies that were classified R 18+ on DVD have since been aired on Australian TV with an MA 15+ classification.

===== Consumer advice =====
Consumer advice is compulsory for all MA 15+ and one-off programmes, as well as very short series classified M or higher (such as feature films, miniseries and documentaries). When a programme carries consumer advice, appropriate abbreviations are displayed along with the classification symbol after each commercial break. In general, these abbreviations are as follows:

* A – used for programmes with adult themes, medical procedures or crude humour.
* V – used for programmes depicting violence;
* L – used for programmes coarse language;
* S – used for programmes depicting simulated sex scenes and/or references;
* H – used for programmes containing horror or supernatural themes;
* D – used for programmes with drug references and/or use;
* N – used for programmes containing nudity;

For violence, coarse language and sex scenes, the intensity and/or frequency is mentioned in front of the consumer advice. These include: &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;stylised&quot;, &quot;some&quot;, &quot;frequent&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;. Example: &quot;strong sex scenes&quot;.

=== Brazil ===
A television content rating system in Brazil was implemented following a consultation in 2006. Since then, the television networks themselves rate the shows, while the indicative rating () judges the content to guarantee that the rating is appropriate for that specific show. On broadcast networks, where the system is mandatory, the ratings are also translated in Brazilian Sign Language, and may also carry content descriptors. The icons must be shown at the start of each block of the show, and their respective promos.

All rating is advisory unlike films. The Brazilian content rating system utilizes age-specific classifications (with the exception of L-rated programming), and generally follow the film ratings. However, unlike with films, television programmes can be rated by the broadcaster with the need to formally submit them for a rating, although the Department of Justice, Ratings, Titles and Qualification (DEJUS) reserves the right to revise the rating. Ratings assigned by the broadcaster mirror those assigned by DEJUS, but are preceded by the letter &quot;A&quot;.


=== Canada ===

The Canadian TV Classification System was created in late 1997 for English-language programmes to use, which lined up with those of the American v-chip, both matching that system and allowing television manufacturers to use the same backbone firmware for both systems. The upper-right corner of symbols are shaped like the corner of a maple leaf, as is used in the national flag, and are rendered in black and white. The icons are intended to be shown once an hour lasting 15 seconds, although in the case of longer programmes that do not start on the hour, some broadcasters show the rating at the start and at the top of each subsequent clock hour, while others show the rating at the start and again precisely one hour later. However, there are some networks like Global that only display the television rating at the beginning of the show. The icons are displayed in the upper-left corner and the size is mandated to be a minimum of 52 scan lines or pixels tall, and must also fully cover an American ratings icon if burned-in or broadcast live by an American broadcaster.

Additionally, should a programme contain content potentially unsuitable for some viewers, such as violence, coarse language, or nudity, members of the self-regulating Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (which does not include the CBC, although it still uses such warnings) are required to air a disclaimer at the beginning of the programme and at the end of each commercial break, advising viewer discretion (such disclaimers are only required for the first hour if airing after 9:00 p.m.). This disclaimer is technically required even if the final commercial break comes immediately before the closing credits, and some (but not all) channels in fact observe this.

Notably, the television rating given may depend on the level of cable and satellite, or if the programme is broadcast over-the-air. Also, television ratings are generally considered more restrictive than movie ratings.

==== English-language ratings ====

The Canadian rating system for English-language broadcasters (as well as third-language broadcasters, which broadcast in a language other than English or French) is as follows:
* Exempt – Programming that is exempt from ratings (such as news and sports programming) will not display an on-screen rating at all.
* C – Programming is intended for younger children under the age of 8 years. No offensive language or sexual content of any level allowed. Might contain occasional comedic, unrealistic depictions of violence.
* C8 – Intended for children ages 8+. Infrequent/mild violence and fantasy horror is allowed. No profanity is allowed, but occasional &quot;socially offensive and discriminatory&quot; language is allowed if in the context of the story. No sexual content of any level allowed.
* G – Intended for general audiences. Programming suitable for the entire family with minimal and infrequent violence. No profanity is allowed, but offensive slang is permitted. No sexual content.
* PG – Intended for general audiences, but may not be suitable for children under the age of 8. Moderate violence and infrequent/mild profanity is allowed. May contain brief nudity and sexual references if important to the context of the story. Some content may not be suitable for children under the age of 8 and parental supervision is recommended for children aged 8–13.
* 14+ – Programming intended for viewers ages 14 and older. May contain intense violence and strong/frequent profanity. Might contain nudity and depictions of sexual activity as long as they are within the context of a story. Parents are strongly cautioned to exercise discretion in permitting viewing by pre-teens and early teens without parent/guardian supervision.
* 18+ – Programming intended for viewers ages 18 and older. May contain explicit violence, graphic language, and explicit portrayals of sexual activity. Programming with this rating cannot air before the watershed (9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.).

==== French-language (Québécois) ratings ====
French-language broadcasters use a rating system that is virtually identical to Quebec&#x27;s Régie du cinéma&#x27;s film rating system, with one additional category (8+):
* G: Général (general) – appropriate for all ages and must contain little or no violence and little to no sexual content.
* 8+ ans – appropriate for children 8 and up may contain with little violence, language, and little to no sexual situations;
* 13+ ans – suitable for children 13 and up and may contain with moderate violence, language, and some sexual situations;
* 16+ ans – recommended for children over the age of 16 and may contain with strong violence, strong language, and strong sexual content;
* 18+ ans – recommended to be viewed by adults and may contain extreme violence and graphic sexual content. It is mostly used for 18+ movies and pornography.
* An E rating (no rating will appear on screen) is given to exempt programming, in the same classes used for English-Canadian programming above.

=== Colombia ===

As of 2011, programs in Colombia are regulated by the National Television Commission, and are divided into the following categories:
* Children - Programs that have been designed and produced to meet the entertainment, education or training needs of children between 0 and 12 years old, whose narrative and language respond to the profile of that audience. They must be broadcast between 07:00 and 21:30. These programs must be suitable to be watched by the child audience, without the company of adults.
* Teenager - Programs that have been designed and produced to meet the entertainment, education or training needs of children between 12 and 18 years old, whose narrative and language respond to the profile of that audience. They must be broadcast between 07:00 and 21:30. These programs must be suitable to be watched by the adolescent audience, without the company of adults.
* Family - Programs that have been designed and carried out to meet the needs of entertainment, education or training of the family. They must be broadcast between 05:00 and 22:00. These programs should be suitable for viewing by the whole family and may require the company of adults.
* Adult - Programs that have been designed and carried out to meet the entertainment, education or training needs of those over eighteen (18) years of age. They must be broadcast between 22:00 and 05:00. These programmes should be suitable for viewing by the adult population. The presence of children and adolescents shall be subject to the co-responsibility of the parents or adults responsible for the aforementioned population.

Programmes containing Pornography or apologies for violence are not allowed to be broadcast at all in Colombia, even in the adult fringes.

=== Croatia ===

*12 – Not recommended for persons under 12 years of age.
*15 – Not recommended for persons under 15 years of age. Can only be broadcast from 20:00 to 07:00.

=== Denmark ===
Since 1 September 2020, the Media Council for Children and Young People (&quot;Medierådet for Børn og Unge&quot;) classifies all programmes and films for television broadcast and video-on-demand release, using the same rating system also used for theatrically released films and home media releases. On television, the age limit must be informed orally before the programme starts or continues. The clear rating should be shown during the entire transmission time or a minimum first five minutes, and must be available in programme listings. Films and series on VOD services must have age ratings and mention the content in them that explains why the content was given its rating. The location of the rating is up to the individual provider as long as it is visible to the consumer before choosing a film or program.

This television classification system only applies to domestic television channels and VOD services, such as DR, TV 2, TV3, Kanal 4 and Viaplay. As such, it does not apply to foreign television channels and VOD services, including international streaming services such as Netflix, Max and Disney+.

The requirements apply to all programming outside of news &amp; current affairs; music; sports; live telecasts; instructional &amp; leisure programmes; programming of nonprofit political or religious nature; preface of programmes; and teaching &amp; research programmes.

The ratings are:
*A – Suitable for a general audience.
*7 – Not recommended for children under 7.
*11 – For ages 11 and up.
*15 – For ages 15 and up.

=== Ecuador ===
Article 65 of the &quot;Communications Law&quot; of Ecuador presents the following classification:
* A: &quot;Apto para todo público&quot; (Suitable for all age groups). It can be transmitted at any time, especially in the &quot;FAMILIAR&quot; (FAMILY), from 6:00 to 18:00.
* B: &quot;Apto para todo público, con vigilancia de una persona adulta&quot; (Suitable for all age groups, with supervision of an adult). Under 12 needs an adult. It can be transmitted at any time, especially in &quot;RESPONSABILIDAD COMPARTIDA&quot; (SHARED RESPONSIBILITY), from 18:00 to 22:00; but not during &quot;FAMILIAR&quot;.
* C: &quot;Apto solo para personas adultas&quot; (Suitable only for adults). It can be transmitted only during the hours of &quot;ADULTOS&quot; (ADULT), from 22:00 to 6:00.

The classification to which belongs each programme will be arranged by the &quot;Consejo de Regulación y Desarrollo de la Información y Comunicación&quot; (Regulatory and Development Council of Information and Communication) depending on the parameters which are considered relevant.

=== Finland ===


The ratings system for television programmes shown on Finnish television channels consists of the following mandatory age classifications:

* S (or T for Swedish-language programming) – allowed at all times; suitable for all audiences
* 7 – allowed at all times, not for persons under 7;
* 12 – allowed at all times, not for persons under 12;
* 16 – not allowed air before 9:00 p.m., not for persons under 16;
* 18 – not allowed air before 11:00 p.m., not for persons under 18.

Programmes with an age rating may contain an additional marker for violence (a fist), sex (the male and female symbols), fear (a spider), or substance abuse (a syringe).

=== France ===

A content rating system in French is regulated by the &quot;Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel&quot; (CSA). Each rating icon is translucent and, as of December 2012, is shown for the whole duration of the show.

* If no rating appears, it is most likely appropriate for all ages.
* Déconseillé aux moins de 10 ans (English: &quot;not recommended for children under 10&quot;) – not allowed in children&#x27;s television blocks;
* Déconseillé aux moins de 12 ans (English: &quot;not recommended for children under 12&quot;) – not allowed air before 10:00 p.m. (some channels and programmes are subject to exception);
* Déconseillé aux moins de 16 ans (English: &quot;not recommended for children under 16&quot;) – not allowed air before 10:30 p.m. (some channels and programmes are subject to exception);
* Déconseillé aux moins de 18 ans (English: &quot;not recommended for persons under 18&quot;) – allowed only between midnight and 5 a.m.

There initially was no ratings system for French television. In March 1961, following the broadcast of a film where a female nude was briefly visible, the &quot;white square&quot; was introduced. A white square, replaced by a white rectangle in 1964, was displayed in the corner of the screen. An off-screen voice warned at the beginning of the programme that it was unsuitable for all audiences. This system continued until 1996 when the &quot;Conseil supérieur de l&#x27;audiovisuel&quot; replaced it with a system of five pictograms, indicating the suitability of the program. This system was replaced by the current system on 18 November 2002.

=== Germany ===


In Germany, every broadcaster has to show a disclaimer displaying the sentence &quot;Die nachfolgende Sendung ist für Zuschauer unter 16/18 Jahren nicht geeignet&quot; before transmission if the programme contains potentially offensive content. This roughly translates to &quot;The following programme is not suitable for viewers under 16/18 years of age&quot;. The (FSF) checks many shows in private television.
* 0 – For all ages, can be broadcast any time.
* 6 – For ages 6 and up, can be broadcast any time.
* 12 – For ages 12 and up, split between content that can be broadcast any time, and content that can only be broadcast between 20:00 and 6:00.
* 16 – For ages 16 and up, can only be broadcast between 22:00 and 06:00.
* 18 – For ages 18 and up, can only be broadcast between 23:00 and 06:00.
* X – No broadcast.

=== Ghana ===

In Ghana, TV series and selected TV programmes are classified by the Film Classification Committee:

* U – Universal for all categories of persons.
* PG – Viewers below twelve are to watch under Parental Guidance.
* 12+ – For persons of twelve years and above (generally suitable for children aged under 12).
* 15+ – For persons of fifteen years and above (aimed at a teenage audience).
* 18+ – For persons of eighteen years and above only (specifically for adults).
* NS – Not suitable for public exhibition.

=== Greece ===
A new content rating system in Greece was introduced on 30 September 2019. The system is now associated with the age of viewers and has new visual symbols (replacing rhombus, circle, triangle, square and cross symbols), however, there are no mature-accompanied ratings compared to the previous system. The ratings are compulsory and are displayed and verbally announced at the beginning of each broadcast. These provisions are enforced by the Greek National Council for Radio and Television (ESR).

* K – suitable for all ages
* 8 – suitable for ages 8 and up (allowed only 30 minutes before and after the kid-friendly zone)
* 12 – suitable for ages 12 and up (allowed only between 9:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., or between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. during Fridays, Saturdays and school holidays)
* 16 – suitable for ages 16 and up (allowed only between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.)
* 18 – suitable for ages 18 and up (allowed only between 1:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.)

Also, programmes suitable for ages 12 and up will be accompanied by a special word marker identifying their content, which is divided into the following four categories:
* ΒΙΑ (English: &quot;VIOLENCE&quot;): The programme contains scenes of violence.
* ΣΕΞ (English: &quot;SEX&quot;): The programme contains sex scenes.
* ΧΡΗΣΗ ΟΥΣΙΩΝ (English: &quot;USE OF SUBSTANCES&quot;): The programme contains scenes of drug use and other addictive substances.
* ΑΚΑΤΑΛΛΗΛΗ ΦΡΑΣΕΟΛΟΓΙΑ (English: &quot;INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE&quot;): The programme contains inappropriate language.

=== Hong Kong ===

The Hong Kong television rating system is since by generic code of television programmes standard of the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap.562) on 11 December 1995. The current ratings are:
* If no rating appears, it is for general audiences. 
* PG (parental guidance recommended) – programmes are unsuitable for children, parental guidance is recommended; programmes that are classified as &#x27;PG&#x27; should not be broadcast between 4:00 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. every day, as this is a watershed devised for family viewing. 
* M (mature) – programmes are recommended for adult viewers above the age of 18, only allowed to be shown between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Before 24 September 2020, the programmes were only allowed to be shown between 11:30 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
=== Indonesia ===

The Indonesian Broadcasting Commission (KPI)&#x27;s Broadcasting Code regulate broadcast television content that classifies television programme into several classifications:
* SU – (All Ages) – suitable for all ages over the age of 2 years;
* P – (Preschool) – suitable for preschool children aged 2 through 6 (not yet in use by any TV channel);
* A – (Children) – suitable for children from ages 7 through 12;
* R – (Teenagers) – suitable for teens from ages 13 through 17;
* D – (Adult) – suitable for viewers over 18 and older. Programmes with this rating may only be aired between 22:00 local time and 03:00 local time the next day.

There is unofficially also a BO (, Parental Guidance) subrating often used accompanied with the above ratings (P-BO, A-BO, or R-BO). The KPI Broadcasting Code does not regulate the BO rating; instead it requires broadcasters to show a &quot;viewer discretion advised&quot; card before the beginning of a P, A, or R-rated program; however many broadcasters does not show this card.

In addition, all films and advertisements broadcast in Indonesia must be rated by the Film Censorship Agency (LSF) and use the ratings provided by the LSF to rate those films and advertisements broadcast. Although the Broadcasting Code only requires films and advertisements to be rated by the LSF prior to broadcast, many broadcasters opted to have all prerecorded programs (not just films and advertisements) to be rated by the LSF and use the ratings given by the LSF on rating those programs.

=== Mexico ===

The classification system of television programmes in Mexico is rated by the Dirección General de Radio, Televisión y Cinematografía, and consists of the following classes:
* AA – aimed at children (can be broadcast anytime);
* A – for persons of all ages (can be broadcast anytime);
* B – for persons over 12 years of age (allowed only between 16:00 and 05:59);
* B-15 – for persons over 15 years of age (allowed only between 19:00 and 05:59);
* C – for adults (i. e. persons over 18 years of age) (allowed only between 21:00 and 05:59);
* D – exclusively for adults (allowed only between midnight and 05:00);

=== Morocco ===

The classification system of television programmes in Morocco is established by the HACA. There are 4 categories. Before the airing of the program, an off-screen voice warned at the beginning of the programme that it was unsuitable for all audiences.
=== Netherlands ===
The television rating system in the Netherlands was created in 2001 by the &quot;Dutch Institute for the Classification of Audiovisual Media&quot; (NICAM) and is known as Kijkwijzer (ViewingGuide or WatchWiser). The same rating systems are used for both television programmes and films, and serve partly as guidelines (Programmes with the classification 12, 14 and 16 years may only be broadcast from 8pm and with the classification 18 years from midnight. Cinemas and theaters in the country cannot provide films with the classification 16 years to people under the age of 16). They are the same as Dutch film ratings.

The following age ratings apply:
* AL – All Ages (Alle leeftijden)
* 6 – Watch out with children under 6 (Let op met kinderen tot 6 jaar)
* 9 – Watch out with children under 9 (Let op met kinderen tot 9 jaar)
* 12 – Watch out with children under 12 (Let op met kinderen tot 12 jaar)
* 14 – Watch out with children under 14 (Let op met kinderen tot 14 jaar)
* 16 – Watch out with children under 16 (Let op met kinderen tot 16 jaar)
* 18 – Watch out with children under 18 (Let op met kinderen tot 18 jaar)

There are also six descriptor icons used:
* Violence (Geweld)
* Fear (Angst)
* Sex (Seks)
* Discrimination (Discriminatie)
* Drugs and/or alcohol abuse (Drugs- en/of alcoholmisbruik)
* Coarse Language (Grof taalgebruik)

=== New Zealand ===

On 1 May 2020, New Zealand realigned its television content rating system to a common system for free-to-air television, subscription television and on-demand services:

* G: Approved for general viewing (this was unchanged from the previous rating system).
* PG: Parental Guidance recommended for younger viewers (previously known as PGR, Parental Guidance Recommended).
* M: Suitable for mature audiences 16 years and over.
* 16: People under 16 years should not view.
* 18: People under 18 years should not view.
The last three ratings replaced the former AO (Adults Only) classification.

On free-to-air television, programmes classified M can be broadcast between 9.00am and 3.00pm on weekdays (school term time only, as designated by the Ministry of Education) and from 7.30pm until 5.00am on a daily basis. Programmes classified 16 can only be broadcast after the 8.30pm watershed, while programmes classified 18 can only be broadcast after 9.30pm.

On pay television, where content filtering is not available, programmes classified 18 can only be broadcast between 8.00pm and 6.00am on a daily basis and from 9.00am until 3.00pm on weekdays (school term time only). If content filtering is available, programmes classified 18 can be broadcast at any time. Explicit adult sex programmes classified 18 may screen only on premium channels.

The following descriptor codes (audience advisories) may be added for programmes classified PG or higher:

* C: Content may offend
* L: Language may offend
* V: Contains violence
* S: Sexual content may offend

=== North Macedonia ===

North Macedonia uses five symbols for each program. They are as follows:
*● – Programme can be watched by everyone.
*● – Programme not recommended for children below the age of 8 (parental supervision required under this age).
*■ – Programme not recommended for children below the age of 12 (parental supervision required under this age). Only broadcast between 20:00 to 5:00.
*▲ – Programme not recommended for children below the age of 16 (parental supervision required under this age). Only broadcast between 22:00 to 5:00.
*X – Programme not suitable for audiences under 18 years of age. Only broadcast between 0:00 to 5:00.

The symbols are put in the lower-left or lower right corner on screen.

=== Norway ===
In Norway Television broadcasters are obliged to classify their programmes in the following age categories: A (all ages), 6 years, 9 years, 12 years, 15 years or 18 years. The classification must be based on the guidelines made by The Norwegian Media Authority. Programmes in the different age categories must be transmitted according to the following time schedule during the day:
* A, 6, 9 – allowed at all times
* 12 – only allowed during the period 19.00 – 05.30
* 15, 18 – only allowed during the period 21.00 – 05.30

Television broadcasters shall specify the age limit acoustically before the programme starts or clearly mark the programme with an age limit throughout its duration. Television broadcasters shall also specify the age limit in programme schedules and electronic programme guides. Content that is judged to be harmful to minors are a no-no from broadcast altogether. 

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board, commonly known as MTRCB, implements and regulates local television content rating systems. In 1979, it only had implemented two television ratings: &quot;General Viewership&quot; (GV) later renamed (General Patronage/GP) in 1995 and &quot;Parental Guidance&quot; (PG), in the mid-1990s up until from now on, some advisories are simply written on the upper left side or at the lower right side of the television screen.

On 6 October 2011, in order to encourage parents to supervise and be responsible with their children in watching television, the MTRCB revamped its rating system, implementing a three-tiered system:


The new ratings system is similar to the old one, but the look and the ratings themselves were completely revamped. All of these were only implemented on Free to-Air Television stations. The new system consists of a new full-screen advisory of the programme&#x27;s rating which is played before each programme, whatever the rating of such programme is, except in the case of programmes with SPG rating, wherein the rating must be aired twice (before the start of the programme and after each commercial break. e.g. in the middle part of the programme). A rating logo then appears at the bottom right of the screen during a programme if it was rated as such. Sometimes, when annotations are to be put and it takes the place of the logo, then it has to be put on the upper left side of the screen, opposite the logo of the TV station.

On 9 February 2012, the SPG rating was implemented, which utilizes at least one of the following content descriptors:
* T for &quot;tema&quot; (themes);
* L for &quot;lengguwahe&quot; (language);
* K for &quot;karahasan&quot; (violence); {V is also used for programmes in English or a foreign language}
*S for &quot;sekswal&quot; (sex);
*H for horror&quot;;&quot; and
*D for &quot;droga&quot; (drugs);

The SPG rating was first broadcast on the film &quot;Cinco&quot; which was aired in ABS-CBN, where it had its old advisory.

=== Poland ===

Before 2000, Poland did not have a uniform classification system for television programmes. Some stations, however, applied their own systems. TVP showed a card with the text &quot;Adult only&quot; or &quot;Film for adult audiences only&quot;. Canal+ used their set-top box key colors (green, yellow, red) to indicate &quot;General Audiences&quot;, &quot;Most Likely for Adults&quot; and &quot;For Adults&quot;. Until 27 February 2000, TVN marked adult movies with a pulsating red circle. On 1 March 2000, the &quot;Friendly Media&quot; agreement with the KRRiT and the broadcasters was reached to introduce a uniform system of classification. Eight television broadcasters – TVP, Polsat, TVN, Nasza TV, Canal+, Wizja TV, Polish Cable Television and TV Niepokalanów – had signed the agreement.

The current Polish television rating system was introduced on 15 August 2005 and consists of five icons which need to be broadcast for the entire duration of the program. On 28 August 2011, their appearance was changed to the following:

=== Portugal ===

For a long time, the only existing regulation on Portuguese television was that programmes with potentially shocking or harmful content could air only between 10:30pm and 6am and with a red circular marker on the top-right corner of the screen indicating it was for audiences aged 16 and over.

In 2006, all free-to-air networks decided to complement this rule with a shared, more detailed rating system for TV shows:
* Todos (suitable for all)
* 10, Acompanhamento Parental (for spectators aged 10 or over; parental guidance required for children under 10)
* 12, Acompanhamento Parental (for spectators aged 12 or over; parental guidance required for children under 12)
* 16 (for spectators aged 16 and higher only)

These logos must be shown during 10 seconds in the beginning of any programme and after every break. If a programme is rated 16, it can only be broadcast between 10:30pm and 6am. However, most cable channels in Portugal use the Spanish classification system.

=== Romania ===

The current Romanian rating symbols were adopted in September 2002, and are as follows:
On April 3, 2006, the rating &quot;16&quot; was abolished and was replaced with &quot;15&quot;:
* Unrated – programmes can be viewed by any age.
* AP – programmes are recommended for children under 12 years of age with parental guidance.
* 12 – programmes not for children below the age of 12 years, May only air between 20.00 and 6.00
* 15 – programmes not for teens and children below the age of 15 years, May only air between 22.00 and 6.00. 
* 18 – programmes not for young people (i. e. those under 18 years of age), May only air between 0.00 and 6.00

=== Russia ===


The rating system for programmes and films shown on Russian television:
* 0+ (Suitable for all ages)
* 6+ (May not be suitable for young children)
* 12+ (Intended for viewers over the age of 12)
* 16+ (Intended for viewers over the age of 16)
* 18+ (Unsuitable for children, only for adults)
These logos are shown in the beginning of the programme and after every ad break.

=== Singapore ===

Singapore has adopted the use of TV Ratings from 21 October 2011. They consist of PG and PG13 ratings for Free-to-Air TV and NC16 and M18 ratings in addition to the PG and PG13 ratings for Pay TV channels. For Free-to-Air TV, the shows rated PG may be aired anytime while PG13 should air between 10pm to 6am. For Pay TV, PG13 rated programmes can be shown anytime. Before the rated programme starts the TV channels will show a notification. From now on, only StarHub TV&#x27;s and Singtel TV&#x27;s self-packaged non-regional Pay TV channels (e.g. StarHub TV&#x27;s E City and Sensasi and Singtel TV&#x27;s FashionTV HD and FashionTV HD on Demand, both of which features modeling nudity in certain programmes) are enabled to carry NC16 and M18 rated content. FashionTV is also Singapore&#x27;s first official M18 rated channel. M18 rated programmes can only be telecast from 10pm onwards to 6am on Pay TV. Regional channels like Fox Life, Fox Movies and HBO Asia are unable to carry Infocomm Media Development Authority&#x27;s film ratings as they are targeted at the same region (a certain group of Asia territories), which results in programmes being subjected to external censorship of a much harsher nature outside Singapore territorial control. Only Video on Demand (VOD) Pay TV services are allowed to carry R21 content currently. G-rated programmes are not required to show a notification for any channel.

=== Slovakia ===
Slovakian government accepted a law in 2001 (updated in 2007), in which television stations are required to display one of the following icons during all the programme and in promos:
* Children&#x27;s programming – Content created primarily for children under 12.
* U – Suitable for all age groups.
* 7 – Content not suitable for children under 7 years
* 12 – Content not suitable for children under 12 years
* 15 – Content not suitable for children and teens under 15 years, may only be broadcast from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am (except for trailers with this rating [or lower, for that matter] as they can be broadcast anytime)
* 18 – Content suitable only for those 18 years and older, may only be broadcast from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am (except for trailers with this rating as they can be broadcast 8:00 pm to 6:00 am)
Additional icons used only for educational content which are unused after 2024:
* -7 – Educational content suitable for children younger than 7.
* 7+ – Educational content suitable for children over 7 years
* 12+ – Educational content suitable for children over 12 years
* 15+ – Educational content suitable for teens over 15 years, this programme may only be broadcast from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am

For content suitable for all children, a green &quot;U&quot; icon is available, but broadcasters are not required to use it. Until 2007, all ratings went with faces: green smiley face – all viewers; orange sad face – suitable for 7, 12, 15 years and over; red very sad face – suitable for adults only. In 2024, rating were once again updated, this time at beginning of each programme and in promos, content descriptions were added to the programming:

* Violence (for the &quot;7&quot;, &quot;12&quot;, &quot;15&quot; and &quot;18&quot; ratings)
* Discrimination (only for the &quot;15&quot; and &quot;18&quot; ratings)
* Fear/Horror (for the &quot;7&quot;, &quot;12&quot; and &quot;15&quot; ratings)
* Addiction (only for the &quot;15&quot; and &quot;18&quot; ratings)
* Sex (for the &quot;12&quot;, 15 and &quot;18&quot; ratings)
* Profanity (for the &quot;12&quot;, &quot;15&quot; and 18&quot; ratings)
* Nudity (only for the &quot;12&quot; rating)

=== Slovenia ===

The Slovenian government accepted a law, which requires television stations to play a voiceover and age icon warning, which has to be at least 10 seconds long before programmes, inappropriate for some audiences begin. Additionally, one of the following icons (a white rhombus with the age number) has to be displayed for the duration of the programme:

* VS (vodstvo staršev) – Parental guidance suggested for children under 12.
* 12 – Content suitable for children over the age of 12.
* 15 – Content suitable for teens over the age of 15.
* 18 – Content suitable for adults.
* 18+ – Not suitable for persons under 18, contains explicit sexual content, may only be broadcast on demand in television programmes and in on-demand audiovisual media services if those programmes are subject to mandatory restricted access for exclusively adults through an assigned PIN or equivalent protection system. Access must be locked by default, and the user must be able to set access to the program content, whereby only an adult who becomes acquainted with the purpose of technical protection and who is provided with detailed instructions on its use can be given permission to view (code, password).
* 18++ – Pornographic content/programmes which unlawfully depict violence. These programmes are subject to mandatory restricted access for the exclusive reaches of legal age through an assigned PIN or equivalent protection system. Access must be locked by default, and the user must be able to set access to the program content, whereby only an adult who becomes acquainted with the purpose of technical protection and who is provided with detailed instructions on its use can be given permission to view (code, password).

Before 2014, two symbols were used for content unsuitable for all audiences. A red triangle with a stylised eye icon was used for content where parental guidance is advised for viewers under the age of 15, while content unsuitable/not allowed under the age of 15 had to be recognisable by a red circle symbol with a stylised eye. Such symbols were in use since 2003. In 2007 new content rating symbols were introduced: red inverted triangle-shaped symbols with VS (parental guidance), +12 and +15 inscriptions, while for 18+ rated content a red circle-shaped symbol with the letters AD was used.

Sometimes, age rating symbols are accompanied by additional symbols, which are not shown on-screen and warn the audience of the type of inappropriate content:

* Violent content can be recognised by a white rhombus, containing two stick figures. One is laying on the floor while being beaten up by the other with a baseball bat.
* Scary content contains a white rhombus with a stylised grey ghost figure.
* Sexual content is recognised by a white rhombus, containing conjoined male and female sex symbols (circle with a cross, pointing downwards and a circle with an arrow, pointing upwards).
* Programmes, containing dangerous scenes are equipped with a white rhombus, containing a crouching stick figure, trying to jump over a fence and an open fire.
* If a programme includes discriminative scenes, a white rhombus, containing three stick figures, of which the middle one is white, while the other two are black is shown.
* A white rhombus, containing a bottle, defaced with a stylised face warns of programming including drug and/or alcohol abuse scenes.
* If there is usage of inappropriate or strong language in a show, a white rhombus, containing a speech bubble with a hash sign, ampersand (&quot;and&quot; sign) and an exclamation mark is seen.

Programmes, appropriate for all audiences do not have a rating.

The public broadcaster RTV Slovenija and most other broadcasters use three watersheds. 12+ rated content is shown between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., 15+ rated programmes are allowed between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., and adult-only content can be shown between midnight and 5 a.m. Cartoons and children&#x27;s programmes are screened until 7 PM.

=== South Korea ===
The South Korean television rating system has been in force since 2000, and it started with only four classifications which were All, 7, 13 and 19. In February 2001, all programmes except domestic dramas (which had been enforced since November 2002) has required to have a rating system. In 2007, the 13 rating was replaced with 12 and the 15 ratings. Most programmes have to be rated, except the &quot;exempt&quot; rating below. Even if it qualifies for being exempt, a broadcaster may apply a rating.

* All (, &quot;Modeun yeollyeong sicheongga&quot;): This rating is for programmes that are appropriate for all ages. Television programmes with this rating may contain some violence and/or some mild language. No adult content is allowed.
* 7 (, &quot;Chilse isang sicheongga&quot;): This rating is for programmes that are inappropriate for children under 7. Television programmes with this rating can contain mild violence, mild language and few romance.
* 12 (, &quot;Sibise isang sicheongga&quot;): This rating is for programmes that are inappropriate for children under 12. Television programmes with this rating may contain horror, some fantasy violence, some sexual content, little use of strong language, mild blood, and/or mild suggestive themes.
* 15 (, &quot;Sibose isang sicheongga&quot;): This rating is for programmes that are inappropriate for children under 15. TV shows with this rating may contain use of alcohol, more sexual content, mild violence or little strong violence, major blood or gore, and/or suggestive themes.
* 19 (, &quot;Sipguse isang sicheongga&quot;): This rating is for programmes that are inappropriate for minors. 19-rated programming is banned from airing during the hours of 7:00AM to 9:00AM, and 1:00PM to 10:00PM. (7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Weekends and Public Holidays Only) Programmes that receive this rating will almost certainly have adult themes, sexual situations, strong language and disturbing scenes of violence.
* Exempt (no icon or name): This rating is only for knowledge based game shows; lifestyle shows; documentary shows; news; current topic discussion shows; education/culture shows; sports that excludes MMA or other violent sports; and other programmes that the Korea Communications Standards Commission recognizes. Disclaimer or rating icons are not needed.

Rating icons may be transparent, and can be positioned either on the upper-left or upper-right corner of the screen. The icon has a size of at least 1/20 of the screen, and has black writing on a yellow circle with a white outline. These icons are shown for 30 seconds when the programme starts, and are shown again every 10 minutes, and when the programme resumes after commercial breaks. This does not apply to 19-rated programmes, where the icon must be visible throughout the entire programme. These regulations do not apply to the &quot;All&quot; rating, as it does not have an icon. A rating disclaimer is displayed on the start of the programme for five seconds stating &quot;This programme is prohibited for children under the age of &quot;X&quot;, so parental accompaniment is required&quot; (, &quot;I peurogeuraemeun X-se mimanui eorini/cheongsonyeoni sicheonghagi-e bujeokjeolhameuro bohoja-ui sicheongjidoga piryohan peurogeuraemimnida.&quot;) for 7, 12, and 15 ratings. &quot;All&quot; and &quot;19&quot; ratings have a different disclaimer, which say &quot;This programme is suitable for all ages&quot; (, &quot;I peurogeuraemeun modeun yeollyeong-ui sicheongjaga sicheonghal su inneun peurogeuraemimnida.&quot;) and &quot;This programme is prohibited for children under the age of 19&quot; (, &quot;I peurogeuraemeun sipguse mimanui cheongsonyeoni sicheonghagi-e bujeokjeolhan peurogeuraemimnida.&quot;) respectively.

These ratings are used by all South Korean television broadcasters. Despite being intended for viewing outside of the country, KBS World also uses these ratings.

South Korean television ratings do not include content descriptors or advisories as they do in most other nations. The ratings are therefore used in a broader sense.

=== Thailand ===

In Thailand, a television rating system was introduced in 2006 alongside a movie rating system for movies. In September 2013, the television rating was revised.

Under the new guideline, the so-called &#x27;Free TV&#x27; channels have to label their programmes and reschedule their shows to comply in the following categories:
* Preschool () – content suitable for preschool-aged children
* Children () – content suitable for children between 6–12 years old
* General () – content suitable for general audiences
* PG 13 () – content suitable for people aged 13 and above, but can be watched by those who are under the recommended age if parental guidance is provided. Under this category, the content can be shown on television between 8:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
* PG 18 () – content suitable for people aged above 18 years old; those who are younger than 18 must be provided with parental guidance. The programmes can be shown on television between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
* Adults () – content only suitable for viewers 20 and older, and can be viewed on TV only between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.

TV programmes in Thailand are already labeled by a certain system of categories, a practice criticised by rights group as nanny-state censorship and ridiculed by some Netizens for its confusing standards.

=== Turkey ===
The TV content rating system in Turkey was introduced by RTÜK in 2006. The ratings are the following:
* Genel İzleyici – General audience. Suitable for all ages. Shown (family symbol) at the beginning of the programme/movie and after every commercial break.
* 7+ – Suitable for ages 7 and over. Shown at the beginning of the programme/movie and after every commercial break.
* 13+ – Suitable for ages 13 and over. Shown for the whole duration of the programme/movie (may be translucent). May only be broadcast between 9:30 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
* 18+ – Suitable for ages 18 and over. Shown for the whole duration of the programme/movie (may be translucent). May only be broadcast between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.
* Şiddet ve/veya Korku – Violence and/or horror
* Cinsellik – Sexuality
* Olumsuz Örnek Oluşturabilecek Davranışlar – Negative examples

News programmes, sports competitions, religious ceremonies and commercial communication broadcasts are exempt from the content rating system.

=== United States ===
==== TV Parental Guidelines ====

The TV parental guidelines were first proposed on December 19, 1996, as a voluntary-participation system—in which ratings are determined by participating broadcast and cable networks—by the United States Congress, the television industry and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and went into effect by January 1, 1997, on most major broadcast and cable networks in response to concerns from parents and advocacy groups regarding increasingly explicit sexual content, graphic violence and strong profanity in American television programming, and was designed to be used in conjunction with the V-chip, which the U.S. government had mandated to be built into all television sets manufactured from 2000 onward (and the vast majority of cable/satellite set-top boxes). The system—which is used for, including but not limited to, most television series, specials, made-for-television films, and theatrically released films re-edited for broadcast or basic cable telecast—has since been applied to internet-based television services (such as Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix), digital video retailers (such as Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store and Google Play) and digital media players (such as Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV and Roku). The guidelines are not assigned to sports or news programmes nor are they used during commercial advertisements, outside of promotional ads for network programmes.

The rating icons are required to be shown for 15 seconds at the start of each program, although since June 2005, many advertiser-supported network broadcasters and some syndication divisions also display the assigned rating for that particular programme after each commercial break; for networks and syndicators that continue to run the rating icon once per hour during a programme running longer than 60 minutes, the broadcaster may show the rating again during a segment/scene that starts closest to the top of the next clock hour. Premium channels—in addition to applying them to any offered original programming—may assign Parental Guideline ratings for theatrical or home video-released movies that either did not receive a Motion Picture Association-assigned rating or were aired as an &quot;unrated&quot; cut, which is an exempt.

TV-Y – &quot;All Children: This program is designed to be appropriate for all children, including children from ages 2-6.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Designed to be appropriate for children of all ages. The thematic elements portrayed in programmes with this rating are specifically designed for a very young audience.

TV-Y7 – &quot;Directed to Older Children: This program is designed for children age 7 and above.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Designed for children age 7 and older. The FCC states that it &quot;may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality&quot;. The thematic elements portrayed in programmes with this rating contain mild fantasy and comedic violence.

: TV-Y7-FV &quot;Programs where fantasy violence may be more intense or more combative.&quot;
Programmes given the &quot;FV&quot; content descriptor exhibit more &#x27;fantasy violence&#x27; and are generally more intense or combative than other programmes rated TV-Y7.

TV-G – &quot;General Audience: Most parents will find this program suitable for all ages.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Programmes are generally suitable for all audiences, though they may not necessarily contain content of interest to children. The FCC states that &quot;this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children, [and] most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended&quot;. The thematic elements portrayed in programmes with this rating contain little or no violence, mild language, and little or no sexual dialogue or situations.

TV-PG – &quot;Parental Guidance Suggested: This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Programmes may contain some material that parents or guardians may find inappropriate for younger children. Programmes assigned a TV-PG rating may include infrequent coarse language, some sexual content, some suggestive dialogue, or moderate violence.

TV-14 – &quot;Parents Strongly Cautioned: This program contains material that most parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Programmes contain material that parents or adult guardians may find unsuitable for children under the age of 14. The FCC warns that &quot;parents are cautioned to exercise some care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended&quot;. Programmes with this rating contain intensely suggestive dialogue, strong coarse language, intense sexual situations or intense violence.

TV-MA – &quot;Mature Audience Only: This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17.&quot;&lt;br&gt; 
Contains content that may be unsuitable for children. This rating is rarely used by broadcast networks or local television stations, although it is commonly applied to television programmes featured on certain cable channels (basic and premium networks) and streaming networks for both mainstream and softcore programmes. Programmes with this rating may include crude indecent language, explicit sexual activity and graphic violence.

Some thematic elements, according to the FCC, &quot;may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following&quot; sub-ratings, designated with an alphabetic letter:
* D – Suggestive dialogue (not used with TV-MA-rated programmes)
* L – Coarse language
* S – Sexual content
* V – Violence
** FV – Fantasy violence (exclusive to TV-Y7-rated programmes)

Up to four content descriptors can be applied along with an applied rating, depending on the kind of suggestive content featured in a programme (with the exception of the &quot;FV&quot; sub-rating, due to its sole applicable use for children&#x27;s programmes). As the rating increases pertaining to the age, the content matters generally get more intensive. The &#x27;suggestive dialogue&#x27; descriptor is used for TV-PG and TV-14 rated programmes only, although certain networks may choose to rate their TV-MA programmes with the descriptor, while the DLSV sub-ratings are only used with the TV-PG and TV-14 ratings.

An additional content descriptor, &quot;E/I&quot;, is applied to select TV-Y, TV-Y7, and TV-G programmes that are designed to meet the educational and informative needs of children aged 16 and under. A minimum of three hours of E/I-compliant programming must be broadcast per week by each television network; E/I programming must air between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. to count toward this minimum.

==== Content advisory ratings (premium cable and pay-per-view) ====

The American pay television industry uses a separate, unrelated content advisory system—used in conjunction with the TV Parental Guidelines and the Motion Picture Association rating system—that first went into effect on March 1, 1994, on participating cable-originated premium channels and pay-per-view services (led by the system&#x27;s charter services, HBO, Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel). Inspired by similar content guidelines that had already been included in the services’ monthly programme guides, the voluntary-participation system provides guidance to pay-cable subscribers on the suitability of a program for certain audiences based on its content. Thematic material is rated based on a ten-code system, designated with a two- or three-letter abbreviation and corresponding descriptor:
* AC – Adult Content
* AL – Adult Language
* GL – Graphic Language (exclusive to R/TV-MA-rated programmes)
* MV – Mild Violence
* V – Violence
* GV – Graphic Violence
* BN – Brief Nudity
* N – Nudity
* SSC – Strong Sexual Content (exclusive to R/TV-MA-rated programmes)
* RP – Rape

Up to five content descriptors can be applied, alongside the corresponding rating, to an individual programme to advise viewers of content that may be inappropriate for minors, depending on age group, or for adults with particular sensitivities to certain kinds of mature content.

=== Venezuela ===

Television content in Venezuela is regulated by the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television (&quot;Ley de Responsabilidad Social en Radio y Televisión&quot;), introduced in January 2003. Free-to-air television broadcasters are required to classify their programmes using the following ratings:

* Todo usuario: Suitable for all ages.
* Supervisado: Parental supervision recommended for children and teens (only allowed between 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.).
* Adulto: Suitable only for adults aged 18 or older (only allowed between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.).

It is mandatory for all Venezuelan television stations to broadcast a short presentation, before the broadcast of any programmes, made by the same channel, where the type of programme (recreational, informational, mixed, etc.), type of production (domestic or national independent) elements include containing (such as language, health, sex and/or violence) and lastly the rating of the programme.

===Vietnam===

In Vietnam, VOD and pay-TV contents are subject to the same regulations used to classify films. The current ratings are:

* P – Suitable for all ages.
* K – Should not be viewed by viewers under 13 years old unless they are with their parents or guardians.
* T13 – Not suitable for viewers under 13.
* T16 – Not suitable for viewers under 16.
* T18 – Not suitable for viewers under 18.
* C – Prohibited.

<text>Oil sludge or black sludge is a gel-like or semi-solid deposit inside an internal combustion engine, that can create a catastrophic buildup. It is often the result of contaminated engine oil and occurs when moisture and/or high heat is introduced to engine oil.

==Causes==
Oil sludge may occur due to a variety of different factors. Some of the most common causes are:
* Defective crankcase ventilation system 
* Oil/coolant contamination
* Neglecting oil changes
* Low oil level
* Poor engine design

==Precautions==
Oil sludge is generally preventable through frequent oil changes at manufacturer specified intervals, however, while uncommon, some engines do have a tendency to build up more sludge than others.

<doc id="955078" wikidata="Q962467" url="?curid=955078" title="University of the Arctic">
<text>The University of the Arctic (UArctic) is an international cooperative network based in the Circumpolar Arctic region, consisting of universities, colleges, and other organizations with an interest in promoting education and research in the Arctic region.

UArctic was launched on June 12, 2001, endorsed by the Arctic Council and in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the Rovaniemi Process and the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy.

==Member institutions==

There are more than 150 members in the University of the Arctic. There are 45 members from Canada, 10 from Denmark, 1 from the Faroe Islands, 18 from Finland, 3 from Greenland, 10 from Iceland, 19 from Norway, 55 from Russia, 7 from Sweden, 26 from the United States and 60 from non-Arctic countries (Australia (1), Austria (1), Czech Republic (1), China (16), France (3), Germany (1), India (5), Ireland (3), Italy (1), Japan (1), Korea (2), Mongolia (1), the Netherlands (2) and the United Kingdom (21), plus the International Polar Foundation).

Most UArctic members are higher education institutions, but other members include circumpolar indigenous organizations and research institutions.

==Organization, governance, and administration==
The University of the Arctic is governed by a structure in which the member institutions are represented through various mechanisms. It has evolved steadily since the organization&#x27;s founding in 2001, with the latest addition being the Rectors&#x27; Forum (2006).

===Funding===
The member organizations contribute resources to the University of the Arctic. Some of the countries with participating organizations, including Canada, Finland and Norway, provide funds for the university and its different programs, though the Federal Government of Canada decided in 2011 to cut its funding by 75 percent. A membership fee is also collected annually from member organizations that do not receive a waiver, ranging from 750€ to 4.000€; this fee is calculated based on the member institution&#x27;s operating budget.

==Programs==

===Bachelor of Circumpolar Studies===
The Circumpolar Studies program allows students attending University of the Arctic member institutions to learn about the North, with courses held in the classroom, online, outdoors, and around the world.

The Circumpolar Studies program gives students the opportunity to learn about the lands, peoples, and issues of the circumpolar world and prepares them for advanced study or professional employment in fields such as sustainable resource management, self-government, Arctic engineering, and northern tourism. Special emphasis is given to matters concerning Indigenous people of the Circumpolar North.

The Circumpolar Studies program consists of two required components: The BCS Core and an Advanced Emphasis.

The BCS Core consists of one lower-level introductory course and six upper-level advanced courses in three interdisciplinary fields of study. Advanced Emphases are programs of study, roughly equivalent to a semester of schooling, that focus on the advanced research of an area, issue, or problem of particular relevance to the North and for its people.

===north2north===
The north2north student exchange program provides opportunities for students from UArctic member institutions to experience different northern regions firsthand, and to share experiences face-to-face by allowing students to study at other UArctic institutions.

As a north2north participant, students travel to another circumpolar institution for a period of 3–12 months. This time period is dependent on the needs of the student, as well as the structures of their home and host institutions. Students have the advantage of taking courses that may not be available at their home institution and the courses taken during the exchange year are credited towards their degree. Successful applicants will receive a mobility grant to facilitate their stay at the host institution.

===Field School===

The UArctic Field School incorporates a selection of short, thematically focused courses that provide training for young researchers at member institutions in relevant fields. The Field School provides specialized onsite study of northern issues, organized by northern institutions. The UArctic Field School catalog is an online database of field excursion courses in which students from UArctic member institutions can participate.

==Calotte Academy==

The Calotte Academy is a school of dialogue and a network that concretises every year in the form of a traveling symposium through the Arctic.

<doc id="955079" wikidata="Q748987" url="?curid=955079" title="Line 1 (Beijing Subway)">
<text>Line 1 of the Beijing Subway () is the oldest and one of the busiest lines of Beijing&#x27;s mass transit rail network. The line runs underneath Chang&#x27;an Avenue, the city&#x27;s grand east–west thoroughfare, right through the heart of Beijing with stops on either side of Tiananmen Square. Line 1&#x27;s color is dark red. Through operation with the Batong line started on August 29, 2021.

==Ridership==
As the oldest line of the Beijing Subway, Line 1 was also the most heavily used from the time the subway opened in 1971 until January 2013, when the near-completion of the Line 10 loop caused ridership on that line to surge past Line 1. Daily ridership averaged 1,234,900 in 2014. Peak ridership in 2014 was 1,536,900.

Recent traffic relief efforts have been completed in recent years. The opening of the first phase of the parallel Line 6, caused an 8.46% decrease in daily demand and a 10-20% reduction in peak flow during rush hour. In addition Beijing BRT line 2 parallels the eastern section of Line 1. In the meantime between 2014 and 2015, Line 1 again upgraded its signals to a communications-based train control system allowing trains to run at headways as low as 1 minutes 45 seconds. However, during peak hours, sections of the line were reported in 2013 to still operate above 100% capacity.

==Hours of operation==
The first east-bound trains departs from Gucheng at 4:58am and Pingguoyuan at 5:10am. The first west-bound train departs Sihui at 4:56am and Sihui East at 5:05am. The last east-bound train leaves Pingguoyuan at 10:55pm. The last west-bound train leaves Sihui East at 11:15pm.

==Route==
Line 1&#x27;s western terminus is , located in Shijingshan District. The line heads southeast to its second stop at Gucheng and from there runs straight east, following Chang&#x27;an Avenue all the way to its eastern terminus, in Chaoyang District, just beyond the 4th Ring Road. The line passes through Xidan, Wangfujing and Dongdan, among other important commercial centers of Xicheng and Dongcheng Districts, as well as the Beijing CBD near the China World Trade Center. The line is in length with 23 stations in operation. All stations except for and are underground.

==Stations==

==History==

The first section of subway in Beijing officially started trial operation on January 15, 1971. It was long and ran between Beijing railway station to , which today is a section of Line 1 and 2. A few months later, on August 15, 1971, the line was extended 3 stations west, to . The line was extended again to in November. On April 23, 1973, the line was extended , at this point the line is long with 17 stations. On September 15, 1981, the line was again extended westward to creating a long line with 19 stations. The line was transferred to the newly created Beijing Mass Transit Operation Corporation and was officially opened to the public, ending the decade long trial operation period. By 1981, the annual passenger volume of Beijing Subway was 64.66 million passengers, with a daily average of 177,000 passenger trips.

On August 15, 1986, the second phase of subway construction started and a feasibility study on the construction of the new line between of Fuxingmen to Bawangfen (Today&#x27;s Beijing CBD) was carried out. A new branch heading east to a new station, , was completed between and stations on December 28, 1987. The section between and was transferred to the newly created Line 2 and Line 1 ran between Pingguoyuan and Fuxingmen stations. In January 1991, the feasibility study report on the construction of a new line between Fuxingmen to Bawangfen was approved with construction of the new &quot;Fuba line&quot;, starting in June 1992. On December 12, 1992, Line 1 was extended east for one station to . In 1994, Line 1&#x27;s signals were upgraded to automatic train protection system. On September 28, 1999, the first section of the Fuba line between to was opened. On June 28, 2000, the section between and stations opened, merging Line 1 and the Fuba Line to create a line with 23 stations.

=== Headway Reduction ===
Since 2014, the signaling and power systems has been gradually upgraded to allow for trains to run more frequently. The upgraded CBTC moving block signaling system in place today reduces rush hour headways from every 2 minutes and 5 seconds to 1 minute 45 seconds.

===Platform screen doors===
Due to platform congestion and suicides, a proposal was made in 2010 to refit all stations on Line 1 with platform screen doors. However, the ventilation system in the older stations of Line 1 was incompatible with full-height platform screen doors, so half height platform screen doors were chosen instead. In July 2016, the operator began installing platform screen doors on Line 1. In 2016, the platform screen doors was installed at Yong&#x27;anli station. By the end of 2017, all stations except were retrofitted with half-height platform screen doors, and all the screen doors were put into operation for the first time.

===Through operations with the Batong line===

In 2010, a CPPCC member Chen Dingwang, proposed that services on Line 1 and the Batong line should directly link, with through operations, reducing travel times and removing the unnecessary forced transfers at or . However, the Beijing Subway responded that Line 1&#x27;s and Batong&#x27;s signal systems are completely different, so through-operation will be more difficult to achieve, from an engineering standpoint. As of 2016, preliminary design and feasibility studies are underway to allow for through operations between Line 1 and Batong. On June 12, 2020, the project of the through operation of Line 1 and Batong line was approved by Beijing Development and Reform Commission. Through operation with the Batong line started on 29 August 2021.

==Other facilities==
Rolling stock for Line 1 is parked and maintained at Gucheng Depot and Sihui Carpark.

==Restricted stations==

Beyond , Line 1 extends further northwest where it has several other stations: Gaojing () and Fushouling (). Gaojing station is in the military region. Fushouling station is actually outside the military region. These stations are not open for public use.

Fushouling station&#x27;s opening date is yet to be determined.

A proposal to open the Gaojing station to public is mentioned within 2022 and 2023 working plan of the Shijingshan District.

==Future Development==
===Increasing capacity===
Due to Line 1&#x27;s severe overcapacity problem, there are plans to introduce 7-car or longer trains. In order for this plan to proceed the oldest section of Line 1 between and , which only has platforms long enough to accommodate 6-car trains, will need to be lengthened. The newer section between and , formerly known as &quot;Fuba line&quot; during construction, has platforms long enough for 8-car trains. According to an interview to the director of Beijing Municipal Transport Commission in December 2022, they will introduce 7-car trains in the eastern section of Line 1 and the Batong line in future.

===Branch to Qinglonghudong===
On 8 July 2022, an EIA document regarding Phase III construction of Beijing rail transport system (2022–2027) mentions a proposal about the branch line of Line 1. The branch line is a southwest-to-northeast line starts from Qinglonghudong (located at the east side of Qinglong Lake, in Wangzuo, Fengtai District) to Bajiao Amusement Park in Shijingshan District. It will be in length with 9 new stations. Construction on the Line 1 branch began on January 19, 2024.

To facilitate construction of the extension, the project will need to renovate and expand Station. According to the second announcement of the environmental impact assessment of the Line 1 branch line project released in October 2023, this station will be a new platform for the branch line of Line 1, and the new platform will be combined with the existing Line 1 platform to form a separate island platform, so that the station will become a double-island four-line station, which is extremely rare in China. In March 2024, the China Railway Tunnel Engineering Bureau announced the installation and construction of Shijingshan Stadium South Road in Beijing, announcing that in order to implement the construction of the branch line of Line 1, Station is planned to be closed from July 2024 to June 2027, and and Stations west of the station will be closed until February 2025, and this plan is waiting for the approval of the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government, which also means that Station will not open until February 2025.

<text>The Matza restaurant suicide bombing occurred on March 31, 2002, when a Palestinian Hamas suicide bomber detonated his bomb inside the Matza restaurant in Haifa, Israel, near the Grand Canyon shopping mall, killing 16 Israeli civilians including children and injuring over 40 people.

==The perpetrators==
The military wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that the bombings would continue as long as the siege of then President of the Palestinian National Authority, Yasser Arafat in Ramallah. In addition, Hamas spokesman stated that the suicide bomber was a 22-year-old Palestinian named Shadi Tubasi who originated from the Jenin area.

<doc id="955128" wikidata="Q1949856" url="?curid=955128" title="Motorik">
<text>Motorik is the 4/4 beat often used by, and heavily associated with, krautrock bands. Coined by music journalists, the term is German for &quot;motor skill&quot;. The motorik beat was pioneered by Jaki Liebezeit, drummer with German experimental rock band Can. Klaus Dinger of Neu!, another early pioneer of motorik, later called it the &quot;Apache beat&quot;. The motorik beat is heard in one section of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Autobahn&quot;, a song composed to convey the feeling of driving on the German highway. It is heard throughout Neu!&#x27;s &quot;Hallogallo&quot;, from their self-titled album &quot;Neu!&quot;, and used on all subsequent Neu! albums with differing tempos and variations; Hawkwind reproduced Neu!&#x27;s &quot;Hallogallo&quot; motorik beat on the track &quot;Opa-Loka&quot; on their 1975 &quot;Warrior on the Edge of Time&quot; album.

Some music critics observed that the motorik style conveys a similar sense of forward momentum as the music of Beethoven and Rossini and bears a resemblance to the rhythmic drumming in jazz. They opined that it initially evoked the &quot;glorification of the industrial modern era&quot;.

The motorik beat is in 4/4 time, at a moderate tempo. The pattern is repeated in each bar throughout the song. A splash or crash cymbal is often hit at the beginning bar of a verse or chorus. Klaus Dinger emphasized that it was &quot;very much a human beat,&quot; adding, &quot;It&#x27;s essentially about life, how you have to keep moving, get on and stay in motion.&quot;

==Etymology==
The word&#x27;s use in music journalism may be derived from a punning modification of &quot;motoric&quot;, a term long used by music critics to describe relentless ostinato rhythm, or simply from a combination of &quot;motor&quot; and &quot;music&quot; (German: &quot;musik&quot;). In addition, Motorik is the German word for motor skills. The name may derive from the repetitive yet forward-flowing feel of the rhythm, which has been compared to the experience of driving on a motorway.

==Application==
The drumming style of Moe Tucker, the drummer in the Velvet Underground, has specifically been characterized by music critic Chris Jones as &quot;proto-motorik.&quot; Apart from the German krautrock bands, the motorik beat has been used by bands from many different genres, most often in psychedelic rock, post-punk, indie rock, and contemporary non-German &quot;krautrock&quot; bands. The motorik beat was a characteristic feature in the music of Siouxsie and the Banshees through the involvement of drummers Kenny Morris and Budgie. Other notable artists include Joy Division, Beak, the War on Drugs, Electrelane, the Rapture, LCD Soundsystem, King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, Thee Oh Sees, the Modern Lovers, Iggy Pop, Public Image Ltd, Ultravox, Stereolab, Yo La Tengo, Endless Boogie, Idles, Moon Duo, and Sam Fender.

<text>Brighton Reservation is an Indian reservation of the Seminole Tribe of Florida, located in northeast Glades County near the northwest shore of Lake Okeechobee. It is one of six reservations held in trust by the federal government for this tribe. The reservation has a land area of approximately 146 square kilometers or 36,000 acres and a 2000 census resident population of 566 persons.

Some residents of the reservation speak the Muscogee language (or Creek), which is different from the Mikasuki language of other Seminoles and the Miccosukee tribe. Fewer than 200 people on the reservation speak Muscogee, which is the largest number of speakers in Florida and outside of Oklahoma. The Muscogee language is considered &quot;definitely endangered&quot; by UNESCO.

The Florida guide referred to a &quot;Seminole Village&quot; in 1939, south of the town of Brighton, on a 35,660-acre reservation: To serve the Seminole cattle business, &quot;The Red Barn&quot; was built in 1941 with help from the Civilian Conservation Corps. Hurricane Wilma damaged the roof, which was replaced in 2005.

The Seminole Tribe of Florida operates the Brighton Seminole Casino here, a 27,000-square-foot casino with 375-slot and gaming machines, a seven-table poker room, and high-stake bingo seats, with full-service restaurant and lounge. The reservation also is used for part of the tribe&#x27;s cattle operations, the 12th-largest in the country.

==Other reservations==
The other five Seminole Tribe of Florida reservations are:

*Big Cypress Reservation, the largest territory, including 81.972 sq mi (212.306 km), in Broward and Hendry Counties
*Hollywood Reservation (formerly called the Dania Reservation), acres, Broward County
*Immokalee Reservation, Collier County
*Fort Pierce Reservation, a site in St. Lucie County, taken into trust for the tribe in 1995 by the United States Department of the Interior
*Tampa Reservation, located in Hillsborough County

<text>Alexander Fletcher Watson (born August 8, 1939) is a retired American ambassador and diplomat. He served as United States Ambassador to Peru from 1986 to 1989.

==Biography==
Watson was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard College, earning an A.B. in government in 1961, and joined the Foreign Service in 1962.

He served as Vice Consul/Third Secretary at the American embassy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and in 1964 became Vice Consul at the embassy in Madrid, Spain. He left Spain in 1966 to become an intelligence analyst at the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He continued to serve as an intelligence analyst until 1968, when he began attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, graduating with his master&#x27;s degree a year later.

From 1969 to 1972, Watson again worked overseas, this time in Brazil. He served his first six months in the country as a Political Officer at the embassy in Brasília and then as Consul and Principal Officer in the American Consulate in Salvador da Bahia until July 1973 when he returned to the U.S. to work as a Country Officer in the Office of Brazilian Affairs, a division of the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.
In 1975, he was transferred to the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, becoming Special Assistant for Legislative and Public Affairs to the Assistant Secretary. In 1977, Watson was promoted to Deputy Director of the Office of Development Finance, and one year later became Director. In 1979, Watson returned to Latin America, serving successively as Deputy Chief of Mission in three American embassies: La Paz, Bolivia (1979–1981); Bogotá, Colombia (1981–1984) and Brasília, Brazil (1984–1986).

In 1986, Watson became the U.S. Ambassador to Peru, serving until 1989. In that year, he became Deputy Permanent U.S. Representative to the United Nations, holding this post until 1993, when Watson was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs by President Bill Clinton, retiring near the end of Clinton&#x27;s first term in 1996.

After Watson retired, The Nature Conservancy appointed him in 1996 as Vice President and Executive Director of its Latin America and the Caribbean division and subsequently as Vice President and Executive Director of The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s International Conservation Program. In 2002 he left that position, and now works as Managing Director at Hills &amp; Co International Consultants.

Watson has served on the boards of several non-profit organizations, including the Pan American Development Foundation, the Una Chapman Cox Foundation, PCI Media Impact, the Inter-American Foundation, the Latin America Program of the Wilson Center for International Scholars, LASPAU and the Maryland/DC Chapter of The Nature Conservancy. In 2004, he joined Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change, a group of retired diplomats and military commanders opposed because of the Iraq war to the reelection of President George W. Bush.

He speaks Spanish and Portuguese. He is married to Judith Tuttle, and has two children, David Watson and Caitlin Watson. Watson&#x27;s father is Fletcher G. Watson, former professor of science education at Harvard.

<text>Kies is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving only a remnant of the outer rim. It was named after German mathematician and astronomer Johann Kies. It is located in the Mare Nubium almost due south of the crater Bullialdus. Northwest of Kies is König. To the south-southwest lies a lunar dome structure designated Kies Pi (π). It has a small crater at the top and is most likely volcanic in origin.

The rim of Kies has numerous gaps and forms a series of ridges in a ring-shaped formation. The most intact rim structures lie in the south and northeast sections of the wall. A low promontory ridge is attached to the southern end of the rim, pointing southwards.

Rays from Tycho crater, located far to the southeast, cross Kies and the surrounding mare.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kies.
