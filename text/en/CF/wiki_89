<text>Yecheon County is a county in the province of North Gyeongsang, South Korea. It is 661 km2 in area, and in 2004 had a population of 52,311. It has lost over 2/3 of its inhabitants since the mid-1960s. It consists of twelve administrative districts (11 myeon and one eup). The county borders Yeongju city to the northeast, Andong city to the east, Uiseong county to the southeast, Mungyeong city to the west, Sangju city to the southwest, and Danyang county of North Chungcheong province to the northwest.

<doc id="968777" wikidata="Q124292" url="?curid=968777" title="Cholangiocarcinoma">
<text>Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts. Symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include abdominal pain, yellowish skin, weight loss, generalized itching, and fever. Light colored stool or dark urine may also occur. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, infection with certain liver flukes, and some congenital liver malformations. Most people have no identifiable risk factors. The diagnosis is suspected based on a combination of blood tests, medical imaging, endoscopy, and sometimes surgical exploration. The disease is confirmed by examination of cells from the tumor under a microscope. It is typically an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes mucin).
Cholangiocarcinoma is typically incurable at diagnosis which is why early detection is ideal. In these cases palliative treatments may include surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stenting procedures. In about a third of cases involving the common bile duct and less commonly with other locations the tumor can be completely removed by surgery offering a chance of a cure. Even when surgical removal is successful chemotherapy and radiation therapy are generally recommended. In certain cases surgery may include a liver transplantation. Even when surgery is successful the 5-year survival is typically less than 50%.
Cholangiocarcinoma is rare in the Western world, with estimates of it occurring in 0.5–2 people per 100,000 per year. Rates are higher in Southeast Asia where liver flukes are common. Rates in parts of Thailand are 60 per 100,000 per year. It typically occurs in people in their 70s, and in the 40s for those with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Rates of cholangiocarcinoma within the liver in the Western world have increased.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common physical indications of cholangiocarcinoma are abnormal liver function tests, jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin occurring when bile ducts are blocked by tumor), abdominal pain (30–50%), generalized itching (66%), weight loss (30–50%), fever (up to 20%), and changes in the color of stool or urine. To some extent, the symptoms depend upon the location of the tumor: people with cholangiocarcinoma in the extrahepatic bile ducts (outside the liver) are more likely to have jaundice, while those with tumors of the bile ducts within the liver more often have pain without jaundice.

Blood tests of liver function in people with cholangiocarcinoma often reveal a so-called &quot;obstructive picture&quot;, with elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transferase levels, and relatively normal transaminase levels. Such laboratory findings suggest obstruction of the bile ducts, rather than inflammation or infection of the liver parenchyma, as the primary cause of the jaundice.

==Risk factors==
Although most people present without any known risk factors evident, a number of risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. For inflammatory bowel disease patients with altered DNA repair functions, the progression from PSC to cholangiocarcinoma may be a consequence of DNA damage resulting from biliary inflammation and bile acids.

Certain parasitic liver diseases may be risk factors as well. Colonization with the liver flukes &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot; (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) has been associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Control programs (Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program) aimed at discouraging the consumption of raw and undercooked food have been successful at reducing the incidence of cholangiocarcinoma in some countries. People with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.

Infection with the bacteria &quot;Helicobacter bilis&quot; and &quot;Helicobacter hepaticus&quot; species can cause biliary cancer.

Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli disease (a specific type of five recognized choledochal cysts), have been associated with an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.

==Pathophysiology==
Cholangiocarcinoma can affect any area of the bile ducts, either within or outside the liver. Tumors occurring in the bile ducts within the liver are referred to as &quot;intrahepatic&quot;, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are &quot;extrahepatic&quot;, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as &quot;perihilar&quot;. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.

Although cholangiocarcinoma is known to have the histological and molecular features of an adenocarcinoma of epithelial cells lining the biliary tract, the actual cell of origin is unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that the initial transformed cell that generates the primary tumor may arise from a pluripotent hepatic stem cell. Cholangiocarcinoma is thought to develop through a series of stages – from early hyperplasia and metaplasia, through dysplasia, to the development of frank carcinoma – in a process similar to that seen in the development of colon cancer. Chronic inflammation and obstruction of the bile ducts, and the resulting impaired bile flow, are thought to play a role in this progression.

Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas may vary from undifferentiated to well-differentiated. They are often surrounded by a brisk fibrotic or desmoplastic tissue response; in the presence of extensive fibrosis, it can be difficult to distinguish well-differentiated cholangiocarcinoma from normal reactive epithelium. There is no entirely specific immunohistochemical stain that can distinguish malignant from benign biliary ductal tissue, although staining for cytokeratins, carcinoembryonic antigen, and mucins may aid in diagnosis. Most tumors (&gt;90%) are adenocarcinomas.

==Diagnosis==
===Blood tests===
There are no specific blood tests that can diagnose cholangiocarcinoma by themselves. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA19-9 are often elevated, but are not sensitive or specific enough to be used as a general screening tool. They may be useful in conjunction with imaging methods in supporting a suspected diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.

===Abdominal imaging===

Ultrasound of the liver and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging modality in people with suspected obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal dilatation and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. Computed tomography (CT) scanning may also play an important role in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma.

===Imaging of the biliary tree===

While abdominal imaging can be useful in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.

===Surgery===

Surgical exploration may be necessary to obtain a suitable biopsy and to accurately stage a person with cholangiocarcinoma. Laparoscopy can be used for staging purposes and may avoid the need for a more invasive surgical procedure, such as laparotomy, in some people.

===Pathology===

Histologically, cholangiocarcinomas are classically well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry is useful in the diagnosis and may be used to help differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.

===Staging===
Although there are at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful in predicting survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.

General guidelines for operability include:
* Absence of lymph node or liver metastases
* Absence of involvement of the portal vein
* Absence of direct invasion of adjacent organs
* Absence of widespread metastatic disease

==Treatment==
Cholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease unless all the tumors can be fully resected (cut out surgically). Since the operability of the tumor can only be assessed during surgery in most cases, a majority of people undergo exploratory surgery unless there is already a clear indication that the tumor is inoperable. In 2008, the Mayo Clinic reported significant success treating early bile duct cancer with liver transplantation using a protocolized approach and strict selection criteria.

Adjuvant therapy followed by liver transplantation may have a role in treatment of certain unresectable cases. Locoregional therapies including transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial radioembolization (TARE) and ablation therapies have a role in intrahepatic variants of cholangiocarcinoma to provide palliation or potential cure in people who are not surgical candidates.

===Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy===
If the tumor can be removed surgically, people may receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy after the operation to improve the chances of cure. If the tissue margins are negative (i.e. the tumor has been totally excised), adjuvant therapy is of uncertain benefit. Both positive and negative results have been reported with adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting, and no prospective randomized controlled trials have been conducted as of March 2007. Adjuvant chemotherapy appears to be ineffective in people with completely resected tumors. The role of combined chemoradiotherapy in this setting is unclear. If the tumor tissue margins are positive, indicating the tumor was not completely removed via surgery, then adjuvant therapy with radiation and possibly chemotherapy is generally recommended based on the available data.
===Treatment of advanced disease===
The majority of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case people are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy has been shown in a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in people with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in people with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
Radiation therapy appears to prolong survival in people with resected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and the few reports of its use in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma appear to show improved survival, but numbers are small.

Infigratinib (Truseltiq) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) that was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2021. It is indicated for the treatment of people with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma harboring an FGFR2 fusion or rearrangement.

Pemigatinib (Pemazyre) is a kinase inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) that was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2020. It is indicated for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion or other rearrangement as detected by an FDA-approved test.

Ivodesinib (Tibsovo) is a small molecule inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1. The FDA approved ivosidenib in August 2021 for adults with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test.

Durvalumab, (Imfinzi) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks the PD-L1 protein on the surface of immune cells, thereby allowing the immune system to recognize and attack tumor cells. In Phase III clinical trials, durvalumab, in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone as a 1st-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer.

Futibatinib (Lytgobi) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2022.

==Prognosis==
Surgical resection offers the only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. For non-resectable cases, the five-year survival rate is 0% where the disease is inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. Overall mean duration of survival is less than 6 months in people with metastatic disease.

For surgical cases, the odds of cure vary depending on the tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15 to 25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for people with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22 to 66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20 to 50%.

The prognosis may be worse for people with primary sclerosing cholangitis who develop cholangiocarcinoma, likely because the cancer is not detected until it is advanced. Some evidence suggests that outcomes may be improving with more aggressive surgical approaches and adjuvant therapy.

==Epidemiology==
Cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare form of cancer; each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States, translating into an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 100,000 people. Autopsy series have reported a prevalence of 0.01% to 0.46%. There is a higher prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in Asia, which has been attributed to endemic chronic parasitic infestation. The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma increases with age, and the disease is slightly more common in men than in women (possibly due to the higher rate of primary sclerosing cholangitis, a major risk factor, in men). The prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma in people with primary sclerosing cholangitis may be as high as 30%, based on autopsy studies.

Multiple studies have documented a steady increase in the incidence of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; increases have been seen in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The reasons for the increasing occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma are unclear; improved diagnostic methods may be partially responsible, but the prevalence of potential risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, such as HIV infection, has also been increasing during this time frame.

<text>Neil Jason Shipperley (born 30 October 1974) is an English football manager and former professional player who played as a forward.

He notably played in the Premier League for Chelsea, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United as well as featuring in the Football League for Watford, Barnsley, Wimbledon and Brentford. He scored the only goal of the 2004 Football League First Division play-off final for Crystal Palace. He was also capped seven times by the England U21 team, scoring three goals.

Following retirement he moved into management with non-league clubs Bedfont, Walton Casuals and North Greenford United.

==Playing career==
===Chelsea===
Shipperley got his break in football at the age of 15, when playing for Spartan League side Brook House in the Middlesex Charity Cup. The tournament&#x27;s patron, celebrity astrologer Russell Grant, was friends with Chelsea chairman Ken Bates, whose club sent a team to the tournament. Shipperley bettered Chelsea centre-back Frank Sinclair for strength and pace, and was scouted by the club. An article in &quot;The Independent&quot; in January 1994 predicted that Shipperley could become Chelsea&#x27;s first homegrown star striker since Peter Osgood in the 1960s.

In the inaugural Premier League season of 1992–93, Shipperley made his professional debut towards the end of the campaign. On 10 April, he came on as a 65th-minute substitute for Robert Fleck in a 1–0 loss at his future club Southampton, and two days later on his first start and first game at Stamford Bridge he scored their last goal in a 4–2 win against Wimbledon.

===Southampton and Crystal Palace===
Shipperley was signed for Southampton by Alan Ball for a record fee of £1.25 million on 6 January 1995. New manager Graeme Souness signed Norwegian Egil Østenstad, prompting Shipperley to drop to the First Division by signing for Crystal Palace for a £1 million fee in October 1996. He scored 13 times for the Eagles over the rest of the season as they were promoted via the play-offs, including one on 10 May in a 3–1 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the first leg of the semi-finals. In 1997–98, he scored seven times – including five consecutive games from October to December – in a season that ended with relegation.

===Nottingham Forest and Barnsley===
In September 1998, Shipperley returned to the Premier League by signing for Nottingham Forest for £1.5 million. He scored only once in 21 games as Forest went down, that coming on 13 March 1999 to round off a 3–1 win at his future club Wimbledon.

For 1999–2000, Shipperley signed for First Division club Barnsley for £700,000. He scored 15 times in 46 total games in his first season, including both of a 2–0 home win over South Yorkshire rivals Sheffield United on 6 November. On 13 May 2000, he opened the scoring in a 4–0 win at Birmingham City in the first leg of the play-off semi-finals, though his team would lose 4–2 to Ipswich Town in the final at Wembley.

===Wimbledon and return to Palace===
Ahead of the 2001–02 season, Shipperley joined Wimbledon for £750,000, and scored on his debut on 11 August to open a 3–1 win over Birmingham. He scored 12 times in his first season with the Dons, including braces in both games against eventual champions Manchester City (4–0 away and 2–1 home wins). He captained the side, and built a prolific partnership with Irishman David Connolly in 2002–03, the club&#x27;s final season.

In July 2003, Shipperley returned to Palace on a three-year deal. On 29 May 2004 at the Millennium Stadium, he captained the side and scored the only goal of a play-off final win against West Ham United to take the Eagles back to the Premier League.

===Later career===
After Palace&#x27;s immediate relegation, Shipperley moved on to Sheffield United on a two-year deal on a free transfer in July 2005. He scored 11 times as the Blades won promotion as runners-up to Reading, including two on 10 December in a 3–0 home win over Burnley.

On 15 January 2007, his contract with Sheffield United was terminated by mutual consent, and he signed a four-month contract with Brentford, eight days later. He failed to score in his eleven appearances for Brentford, and on 25 April 2007 announced his retirement from professional football. In June that year, he rejected the chance to play for Wimbledon&#x27;s successor AFC Wimbledon, telling the &quot;Surrey Comet&quot; that he was in the Middle East to coach a club there.

==Managerial career==
On 20 May 2009, it was announced that Shipperley had become manager of Bedfont in the Combined Counties League. In the summer of 2010, Shipperley was appointed manager of Walton Casuals in the Isthmian League Division One South. In October 2011, after 15 months in the role he re resigned from the role.

On Boxing Day 2011, Shipperley was confirmed as the successor to Steve Ringrose at North Greenford United a post he held until May 2012 when he resigned to look for management experience at a higher level, though he returned in October 2012 following the sacking of Jon-Barrie Bates. He made an appearance as a player against Leighton Town in the final game of the 2012–13 season.

Shipperley&#x27;s second spell as manager at North Greenford United came to an end when he resigned in February 2014 following a 4–1 defeat to Dunstable Town.

==Personal life==
Shipperley&#x27;s father was Dave Shipperley, who played for many years at centre back for Charlton Athletic and Gillingham.

In December 2019, Shipperley was found guilty of public masturbation and intentionally exposing himself to a mother and her 16-year-old daughter. He was given a 12-month community order, ordered to complete 120 hours&#x27; unpaid work plus costs and compensation. He was also made subject to a five-year sexual offences notification requirement order and told to report to Hayes police station within three days. Shipperley had been receiving counselling for personal issues, including the death of his father and gambling addiction, as well as debts.

<text>Yeongyang County (&quot;Yeongyang-gun&quot;) is an inland county in the north-eastern area of North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

==Geography==
An isolated area difficult to access, Yeongyang is sometimes called an &quot;inland island&quot;. The county has the lowest population of all counties in North Gyeongsang Province (without Ulleung County), being mountainous with deep ravines, and only 10 percent of land is cultivable.

==Local specialties==
The county is famous for its apples and chili peppers, and is home to the Yeongyang Chili Pepper Experimental Station. Since 1984, the county has elected a &quot;Miss Chili Pepper&quot; to represent Yeongyang chili peppers.

==Culture==
The area is known as a centre of literature, with the tradition of scholars reading and reciting poetry deep in the mountains, from which have emerged Oh Il-do, Cho Chi-hun and Yi Munyol. Within the county, the Yeondaeam historic temple is located in the village of Samji-Ri.

== Administrative divisions ==

Yeongyang County is divided into 1 eup and 5 myeon.
==Twin towns – sister cities==
Yeongyang is twinned with:

* Gangdong-gu, South Korea 
* Eunpyeong-gu, South Korea

<doc id="968783" wikidata="Q5153557" url="?curid=968783" title="Common law copyright">
<text>Common law copyright is the legal doctrine that grants copyright protection based on common law of various jurisdictions, rather than through protection of statutory law.

In part, it is based on the contention that copyright is a natural right and creators are therefore entitled to the same protections anyone would be in regard to tangible and real property.

The &quot;natural right&quot; aspect of the doctrine was addressed by the courts in the United Kingdom (&quot;Donaldson v. Beckett&quot;, 1774) and the United States (&quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot;, 1834). In both countries, the courts found that copyright is a limited right under statutes and subject to the conditions and terms the legislature sees fit to impose. The decision in the UK did not, however, directly rule on whether copyright was a common-law right.

In the United States, common law copyright also refers to state-level copyrights. These are ordinarily preempted by federal copyright law, but for some categories of works, common law (state) copyright may be available. For instance, in the New York State 2005 case, &quot;Capitol Records v. Naxos of America&quot;, the court held that pre-1972 sound recordings, which do not receive federal copyrights, may nevertheless receive state common law copyrights, a ruling that was clarified and limited with 2016&#x27;s &quot;Flo &amp; Eddie v. Sirius XM Radio&quot;.

== Battle of the booksellers (UK) ==
Until the enactment of the Statute of Anne publishers could pass on their royal grants of copyright to their heirs in perpetuity. The Battle of the Booksellers took place between the 1740s to 1770s through the United Kingdom. The dispute was over common law.

When &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot; reached the House of Lords in 1774, Lord Camden, said &quot;all our learning will be locked up in the hands of the Tonsons and the Lintots of the age&quot;. He declared that &quot;as odious and as selfish as any other, it deserves as much reprobation, and will become as intolerable. Knowledge and science are not things to be bound in such cobweb chains.&quot; The support was from Thomas Lyttelton. The House of Lords ultimately ruled that copyright in published works was subject to the durational limits of the statute. The reasoning behind the decision is disputed, though most scholars agree that the House did not rule against common-law copyright.

The Lords agreed that an author had a pre-existing right &quot;to dispose of his manuscript ... until he parts with it&quot; (Lord Chief Justice De Grey), but that prior to the Statute of Anne the right to copy was &quot;founded on patents, privileges, Star Chamber Decrees and the bylaws of the Stationers&#x27; Company&quot; (Lord Camden). In any event, they determined, the Statute of Anne superseded any common law rights of the author which may have existed prior to the statute. The previous entry here maintained that the Lords found that &quot;parliament had limited these natural rights in order to strike a more appropriate balance between the interests of the author and the wider social good,&quot; quoting Ronan. However, the use of the phrase &quot;natural rights&quot; is not justified by the historical record. Lord Chief Baron Smythe stated that the Statute of Anne was &quot;a compromise between authors and printers contending for a perpetuity, and those who denied them any statute right,&quot; but the Lords in no way accepted that such a common law or &#x27;natural&#x27; right of the author in perpetuity ever existed or developed. Lord Chief Justice De Grey saw no evidence of any such right in the courts in the 300 years since the invention of the printing press and charged that &quot;the idea of a common-law right [of the author] in perpetuity was not taken up till after that failure in procuring a new statute for an enlargement of the term.&quot;

== State law copyright claims ==
&quot;Common law copyright&quot; is also the term used in the United States to refer to most state law copyright claims. In 1978, Section 301 took effect, preempting all state common law copyright claims that fall under subject matter in Section 102 (Subject matter of copyright: In general) or Section 103 (Subject matter of copyright: Compilations and derivative works) except for sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972. This leaves a sizable amount of work that still falls under a mixture of state statutes and common law copyright.

Most state-law copyright claims are preempted by federal copyright law, but for some categories of works, common law (state) copyright may be available. For instance, in the New York State 2005 case, &quot;Capitol Records v. Naxos of America&quot;, the court held that pre-1972 sound recordings, which do not receive federal copyrights, may nevertheless receive state common law copyrights. This precedent was partially overruled in 2016 in &quot;Flo &amp; Eddie Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio&quot;, which determined that the extent of common law copyright in New York did not cover the performance of a sound recording.

Major changes to the federal laws of copyright for pre-1972 sound recordings were made in the 2018 enactment of the Music Modernization Act, including the CLASSICS Act. Such works are now covered by federal copyright law. Federal preemption over the state common law (and conflicting state statutes) implies that federal copyright for those works will now have definite scope and duration, as specified in the federal statutes. Potentially non-preempted common law rights may remain to be identified and addressed as further rulings unfold under the new statute.

<text>Leopold Ackermann (17 November 1771, Vienna – 9 September 1831), known by his cloistral name as Petrus Fourerius, was a professor of exegesis.

He entered on 10 October 1790 in the choral order (canon&#x27;s regular of St Augustine) of Klosterneuburg and studied from 1791-1795 in Vienna. In the following, he became priest and professor for oriental languages at the Stiftshof in Vienna, in 1800 also librarian. He earned his doctorate in theology in 1802, and in 1806 a professorship in exegesis, continuing for 25 years.

<text>Bangsian fantasy is a fantasy genre which concerns the use of the afterlife as the main setting within which its characters, who may be famous preexisting historical or fictional figures, act and interact. It is named for John Kendrick Bangs (1862–1922), who often wrote it.

==Definition==
According to E. F. Bleiler, in his 1983 &quot;Guide to Supernatural Fiction&quot;, &quot;Bangs&#x27; most noteworthy achievement was a contribution to literary typology: the so-called Bangsian story, in which important literary and historical personalities serve humorously as characters in a slender plot line. Bangs did not invent this subgenre, but his work gave it publicity and literary status.&quot;

Bleiler&#x27;s definition does not take into account that some of Bangs&#x27; stories, including the definitive Associated Shades series whose characters reside in Hades, are set in the afterlife. Jess Nevins&#x27; 2003 definition (in &quot;Heroes &amp; Monsters: The Unofficial Companion to the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;) says it is &quot;a fantasy of the afterlife in which the ghosts of various famous men and women come together and have various, usually genial, adventures&quot;, which closely agrees with Rama Kundu&#x27;s 2008 definition.

The genre was part of ancient Greek literature such as several dialogues of Lucian of Samosata and Aristophanes&#x27; Frogs. Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy also features a voyage through Hell and interactions with famous people in the afterlife.

==Selected works of Bangsian fantasy==

===By Bangs===
The four Associated Shades books may be considered collections rather than novels. The first three, at least, were first published as serials in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; shortly preceding their publication as books by Harper &amp; Brothers. (Bangs was humor editor for George Harvey&#x27;s &quot;Harper&quot; magazines from 1889 to 1900.) All were illustrated by Peter Newell.

<text>Cosmeston Medieval Village is a living history medieval village near Lavernock in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales. Based upon remains discovered during a 1980s archaeological dig in the grounds of Cosmeston Lakes Country Park, it is a re-creation of 14th century peasant life in Wales in the Late Middle Ages.

Groups of reenactors regularly perform at the site, camping in tents around the outskirts of the village, and performing displays of historical combat for the public.

==History==

===Early medieval===
The original Cosmeston village grew around a fortified manor house constructed sometime around the 12th century by the De Costentin family, who were among the first Norman invaders of Wales in the early 12th century following William the Conqueror&#x27;s invasion of neighbouring England in 1066. It is unlikely that the manor house at the site was a substantial building and there is documentary evidence that by 1437 the manor house had already fallen into total ruin. The village would have consisted of a number of small stone round houses, or crofts, with thatched roofs, as depicted in the current reconstruction, and the village population would have been between 50 and 100 people at most, including children.

The de Costentin family originated on the Cotentin peninsula in northern France. They were the first lords of the manor and they called the village Costentinstune, which over time became known as Cosmeston. They built the original manor house and, perhaps, a few dwellings or small farms, but for the next two centuries it appears that little further development occurred.

===Later medieval period===
Around 1316 the manor passed into the hands of the de Caversham family, also of Norman descent.

The buildings that have been excavated so far seem to be from the 14th century. It would appear that the de Caversham family brought a more designed approach to the development of the community and a better regulated and more compact settlement began to develop during their stewardship of the village.

There is little sign that the village continued to develop much past the Late Middle Ages. Unusually, no Norman church was ever established in the immediate area, so by 1824 all that remained of Cosmeston village were four isolated crofts and the Little Cosmeston Farmhouse as shown on the Marquis of Bute&#x27;s detailed maps of the time. It is possible that the majority of the villagers were wiped out during the Black Death plague of the 1340s or the later outbreaks, leaving Cosmeston a Deserted medieval village.

In addition to the plague, the villagers would have had to combat other difficulties. The land is low-lying and at the mercy of the many water sources that now feed the Cosmeston Lake. There is substantial evidence of drainage dykes, but even they would have struggled to keep the arable land free from waterlogging and constant flooding. Additionally the period was one of permanent political upheaval with intermittent resistance and armed conflict between several local Welsh leaders. In January 1316, for instance, Llywelyn Bren attacked Caerphilly Castle, and for the next two months there was conflict and devastation throughout the Glamorgan region.

===Modern history===

By the 20th century all evidence of the village had vanished and local residents had no idea of its previous existence. When the Snocem Concrete works and the Cosmeston limestone quarry closed in 1970, the land was developed under Countryside Commission funding as a country park. During the landscaping of the new country park the first evidence of the medieval village was unearthed and an archeological exploration was undertaken.

In addition to being open to the general public, the village accepts school tours and archeological groups, together with staging of special events and re-enactments throughout the year.

===The present===
Cosmeston has been used as a film location for many productions, including a 2014 episode of the hit BBC TV drama series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot; and &quot;Galavant&quot;.

<doc id="968813" wikidata="Q7991971" url="?curid=968813" title="Wheaton v. Peters">
<text>Wheaton v. Peters, 33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 591 (1834), was the first United States Supreme Court ruling on copyright. The case upheld the power of Congress to make a grant of copyright protection subject to conditions and rejected the doctrine of a common law copyright in published works. The Court also declared that there could be no copyright in the Court&#x27;s own judicial decisions.

==Facts==
The case arose out of the printing of the Supreme Court&#x27;s own opinions. Henry Wheaton, the third reporter of decisions, had compiled the opinions of the Court, complete with annotations and summaries of the arguments in Court. This was useful material but made the volumes of his reports costly and out of the reach of most lawyers. His successor as reporter, Richard Peters, in addition to publishing the current volumes of reports, had gone over his predecessor&#x27;s work, eliminated the arguments of counsel and other material beyond the opinions themselves, and published an abridged edition reducing twenty-four volumes into six. The Reporter&#x27;s salary of $1,000 per year did not cover the full expenses of preparing the reports, and the Reporters relied on sales of their books to recoup their costs. By creating more affordable volumes, Peters devastated the market for Wheaton&#x27;s more expensive ones.

Wheaton sued Peters in Pennsylvania and lost in the circuit court. The judge, Joseph Hopkinson, ruled that copyright is purely the creation of statute and that one must comply with the formal requirements for copyright, such as registering the copyright and placing a copyright notice in the work, in order to receive protection. Judge Hopkinson also ruled that there was no federal common law; one must look to the states for common law; and even then, the states did not necessarily adopt the entire English common law if there even was a common law copyright.

Wheaton appealed to the Supreme Court.

==Result==
Justice John McLean, who had publishing experience as the founder of an Ohio newspaper, wrote the opinion of the Court. It ruled that while the common law protected copyright in unpublished writings (such as diaries or personal letters), &quot;this is a very different right from that which asserts a perpetual and exclusive property in the future publication of the work, after the author shall have published it to the world.&quot; McLean declared that post-publication copyright did not exist in the United States but only as a function of statute. &quot;Congress, then, by this act, instead of sanctioning an existing right, as contended, created it.&quot; McLean also rejected Wheaton&#x27;s contention that requiring registration and the deposit of a copy of the copyrighted work with the Department of State were improper prerequisites to copyright protection. Because Congress was granting authors the protection of copyright, it could require them to observe the statutory formalities. That precedent corresponded to the English decision in &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot;, which was cited in the Court&#x27;s opinion.

The Court remanded the case to the circuit court to determine whether Wheaton had satisfied the requirements for copyright protection. Finally, in an often-quoted sentence, the opinion concluded: &quot;It may be proper to remark that the Court is unanimously of opinion that no reporter has or can have any copyright in the written opinions delivered by this Court, and that the judges thereof cannot confer on any reporter any such right.&quot; Thus, any copyright protection for published judicial opinions could cover ancillary materials such as summaries of the opinions and commentaries on them but not the judicially-authored texts of the opinions themselves.

==Dissents==
Justice Smith Thompson wrote a dissenting opinion in which he concluded that Wheaton was entitled to an injunction against Peters&#x27; publication of his reports.

Justice Henry Baldwin also dissented, but his reasoning was not recorded in the original opinion. It appeared in a revised edition of the &quot;U.S. Reports&quot;, published posthumously in 1884.

==Later developments==
===Case resolution===
As the Supreme Court had directed, the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held a trial on the issue of whether Wheaton had satisfied the copyright formalities. The court ruled that he had. Peters appealed, but while the second appeal was pending, both Wheaton and Peters died. The case was then settled, with Peters&#x27; estate paying Wheaton&#x27;s estate $400.

===Legal history===
&quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot; was the first in a line of cases in which the Supreme Court traditionally tried to prevent people from monopolizing information by using copyright law, especially the text of the laws that govern everyone. The decision was upheld and expanded to all judicial opinions in &quot;Banks v. Manchester&quot; although &quot;Callaghan v. Myers&quot; established that editorial additions to the materials could be restricted by copyright.

<text>The Curtis Museum in Alton is a local history museum in Hampshire, England.

The museum was founded in 1865 by Dr William Curtis (1803–1881).

In 2014, ownership of the museum was transferred to the Hampshire Cultural Trust as part of a larger transfer of museums from Hampshire County Council and Winchester City Council.

==Displays==
It contains a wide range of artefacts and displays including:
*Prehistoric tools 
*Roman bowls and other material, including a cup found at Selborne 
*The Anglo-Saxon Alton buckle 
*Artefacts from the Battle of Alton (1643), a battle in the English Civil War 
*The &quot;Jane Austen Trail&quot;
*The tale of Sweet Fanny Adams, who was murdered locally in 1867
*Hop picking and brewing

==Closure threat==
In 2010, both the Curtis Museum and the Allen Gallery were under threat of closure, following their receipt of an email to that effect from the Museum &amp; Arts Service. The Museum and Gallery were taken over by the Hampshire Museums and Galleries Trust, which ran both buildings with the help of volunteers, on behalf of Hampshire County Council. As of May 2014, management was transferred back to Hampshire County Council.

<text>V̇O2 max (also maximal oxygen consumption, maximal oxygen uptake or maximal aerobic capacity) is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption attainable during physical exertion. The name is derived from three abbreviations: &quot;V̇&quot; for volume (the dot over the V indicates &quot;per unit of time&quot; in Newton&#x27;s notation), &quot;O2&quot; for oxygen, and &quot;max&quot; for maximum and usually normalized per kilogram of body mass. A similar measure is V̇O2 peak (peak oxygen consumption), which is the measurable value from a session of physical exercise, be it incremental or otherwise. It could match or underestimate the actual V̇O2 max. Confusion between the values in older and popular fitness literature is common. The capacity of the lung to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide is constrained by the rate of blood oxygen transport to active tissue. 

The measurement of V̇O2 max in the laboratory provides a quantitative value of endurance fitness for comparison of individual training effects and between people in endurance training. Maximal oxygen consumption reflects cardiorespiratory fitness and endurance capacity in exercise performance. Elite athletes, such as competitive distance runners, racing cyclists or Olympic cross-country skiers, can achieve V̇O2 max values exceeding 90 mL/(kg·min), while some endurance animals, such as Alaskan huskies, have V̇O2 max values exceeding 200 mL/(kg·min).

In physical training, especially in its academic literature, V̇O2 max is often used as a reference level to quantify exertion levels, such as 65% V̇O2 max as a threshold for sustainable exercise, which is generally regarded as more rigorous than heart rate, but is more elaborate to measure. 

==Normalization per body mass==
V̇O2 max is expressed either as an absolute rate in (for example) litres of oxygen per minute (L/min) or as a relative rate in (for example) millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of the body mass per minute (e.g., mL/(kg·min)). The latter expression is often used to compare the performance of endurance sports athletes. However, V̇O2 max generally does not vary linearly with body mass, either among individuals within a species or among species, so comparisons of the performance capacities of individuals or species that differ in body size must be done with appropriate statistical procedures, such as analysis of covariance.

==Measurement and calculation==
===Measurement===


Accurately measuring V̇O2 max involves a physical effort sufficient in duration and intensity to fully tax the aerobic energy system. In general clinical and athletic testing, this usually involves a graded exercise test in which exercise intensity is progressively increased while measuring: 
* ventilation and 
* oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air.

V̇O2 max is measured during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX test). The test is done on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. In untrained subjects, V̇O2 max is 10% to 20% lower when using a cycle ergometer compared with a treadmill. However, trained cyclists&#x27; results on the cycle ergometer are equal to or even higher than those obtained on the treadmill.

The classic V̇O2 max, in the sense of Hill and Lupton (1923), is reached when oxygen consumption remains at a steady state (&quot;plateau&quot;) despite an increase in workload. The occurrence of a plateau is not guaranteed and may vary by person and sampling interval, leading to modified protocols with varied results.

===Calculation: the Fick equation===

V̇O2 may also be calculated by the Fick equation:
formula_1, when these values are obtained during exertion at a maximal effort. Here &quot;Q&quot; is the cardiac output of the heart, &quot;Ca&quot;O2 is the arterial oxygen content, and &quot;Cv&quot;O2 is the venous oxygen content. (&quot;Ca&quot;O2 – &quot;Cv&quot;O2) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference.

The Fick equation may be used to measure V̇O2 in critically ill patients, but its usefulness is low even in non-exerted cases. Using a breath-based VO2 to estimate cardiac output, on the other hand, seems to be reliable enough.

==Estimation using submaximal exercise testing==
The necessity for a subject to exert maximum effort in order to accurately measure V̇O2 max can be dangerous in those with compromised respiratory or cardiovascular systems; thus, sub-maximal tests for &quot;estimating&quot; V̇O2 max have been developed.

===The heart rate ratio method===
An estimate of V̇O2 max is based on maximum and resting heart rates. In the Uth &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) formulation, it is given by:
:formula_2

This equation uses the ratio of maximum heart rate (HRmax) to resting heart rate (HRrest) to predict V̇O2 max. The researchers cautioned that the conversion rule was based on measurements on well-trained men aged 21 to 51 only, and may not be reliable when applied to other sub-groups. They also advised that the formula is most reliable when based on actual measurement of maximum heart rate, rather than an age-related estimate.

The Uth constant factor of 15.3 is given for well-trained men. Later studies have revised the constant factor for different populations. According to Voutilainen &quot;et al.&quot; 2020, the constant factor should be 14 in around 40-year-old normal weight never-smoking men with no cardiovascular diseases, bronchial asthma, or cancer.
Every 10 years of age reduces the coefficient by one, as well as does the change in body weight from normal weight to obese or the change from never-smoker to current smoker. Consequently, V̇O2 max of 60-year-old obese current smoker men should be estimated by multiplying the HRmax to HRrest ratio by 10.

===Cooper test===
Kenneth H. Cooper conducted a study for the United States Air Force in the late 1960s. One of the results of this was the Cooper test in which the distance covered running in 12 minutes is measured. Based on the measured distance, an estimate of V̇O2 max [in mL/(kg·min)] can be calculated by inverting the linear regression equation, giving us:

:formula_3

where &quot;d&quot;12 is the distance (in metres) covered in 12 minutes.

An alternative equation is:

:formula_4

where &quot;d&quot;′12 is distance (in miles) covered in 12 minutes.

=== Multi-stage fitness test ===
There are several other reliable tests and V̇O2 max calculators to estimate V̇O2 max, most notably the multi-stage fitness test (or &quot;beep&quot; test).

=== Rockport fitness walking test ===
Estimation of V̇O2 max from a timed one-mile track walk (as fast as possible) in decimal minutes (, e.g.: 20:35 would be specified as 20.58), sex, age in years, body weight in pounds (, lbs), and 60-second heart rate in beats-per-minute (, bpm) at the end of the mile. The constant is 6.3150 for males, 0 for females.

:formula_5

Correlation coefficient for the generalized formula is 0.88.

==Reference values==
Men have a V̇O2 max that is 26% higher (6.6 mL/(kg·min)) than women for treadmill and 37.9% higher (7.6 mL/(kg·min)) than women for cycle ergometer on average. V̇O2 max is on average 22% higher (4.5 mL/(kg·min)) when measured using a treadmill compared with a cycle ergometer.

==Effect of training==
===Non-athletes===
The average untrained healthy male has a V̇O2 max of approximately 35–40 mL/(kg·min). The average untrained healthy female has a V̇O2 max of approximately 27–31 mL/(kg·min). These scores can improve with training and decrease with age, though the degree of trainability also varies widely.

===Athletes===
In sports where endurance is an important component in performance, such as road cycling, rowing, cross-country skiing, swimming, and long-distance running, world-class athletes typically have high V̇O2 max values. Elite male runners can consume up to 85 mL/(kg·min), and female elite runners can consume about 77 mL/(kg·min).

Norwegian cyclist Oskar Svendsen holds the record for the highest V̇O2 ever tested with 97.5 mL/(kg·min).

===Animals===
V̇O2 max has been measured in other animal species. During loaded swimming, mice had a V̇O2 max of around 140 mL/(kg·min). Thoroughbred horses had a V̇O2 max of around 193 mL/(kg·min) after 18 weeks of high-intensity training. Alaskan huskies running in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race had V̇O2 max values as high as 240 mL/(kg·min). Estimated V̇O2 max for pronghorn antelopes was as high as 300 mL/(kg·min).

==Limiting factors==
The factors affecting V̇O2 may be separated into supply and demand. Supply is the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the mitochondria (combining pulmonary function, cardiac output, blood volume, and capillary density of the skeletal muscle) while demand is the rate at which the mitochondria can reduce oxygen in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Of these, the supply factors may be more limiting. However, it has also been argued that while trained subjects are probably supply limited, untrained subjects can indeed have a demand limitation.

General characteristics that affect V̇O2 max include age, sex, fitness and training, and altitude. V̇O2 max can be a poor predictor of performance in runners due to variations in running economy and fatigue resistance during prolonged exercise. The body works as a system. If one of these factors is sub-par, then the whole system&#x27;s normal capacity is reduced.

The drug erythropoietin (EPO) can boost V̇O2 max by a significant amount in both humans and other mammals. This makes EPO attractive to athletes in endurance sports, such as professional cycling. EPO has been banned since the 1990s as an illicit performance-enhancing substance, but by 1998 it had become widespread in cycling and led to the Festina affair as well as being mentioned ubiquitously in the USADA 2012 report on the U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team. Greg LeMond has suggested establishing a baseline for riders&#x27; V̇O2 max (and other attributes) to detect abnormal performance increases.

==Clinical use to assess cardiorespiratory fitness and mortality==
V̇O2 max/peak is widely used as an indicator of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in select groups of athletes or, rarely, in people under assessment for disease risk. In 2016, the American Heart Association (AHA) published a scientific statement recommending that CRF quantifiable as V̇O2 max/peak be regularly assessed and used as a clinical vital sign; ergometry (exercise wattage measurement) may be used if V̇O2 is unavailable. This statement was based on evidence that lower fitness levels are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and mortality rates. In addition to risk assessment, the AHA recommendation cited the value for measuring fitness to validate exercise prescriptions, physical activity counseling, and improve both management and health of people being assessed.

A 2023 meta-analysis of observational cohort studies showed an inverse and independent association between V̇O2 max and all-cause mortality risk. Every one metabolic equivalent increase in estimated cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with an 11% reduction in mortality. The top third of V̇O2 max scores represented a 45% lower mortality in people compared with the lowest third.

As of 2023, V̇O2 max is rarely employed in routine clinical practice to assess cardiorespiratory fitness or mortality due to its considerable demand for resources and costs.

== History ==
British physiologist Archibald Hill introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922. Hill and German physician Otto Meyerhof shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their independent work related to muscle energy metabolism. Building on this work, scientists began measuring oxygen consumption during exercise. Key contributions were made by Henry Taylor at the University of Minnesota, Scandinavian scientists Per-Olof Åstrand and Bengt Saltin in the 1950s and 60s, the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory, German universities, and the Copenhagen Muscle Research Centre.

<text>Messier 92 (also known as M92, M 92, or NGC 6341) is a globular cluster of stars in the northern constellation of Hercules.

== Discovery ==
It was discovered by Johann Elert Bode on December 27, 1777, then published in the &quot;Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch&quot; during 1779. It was inadvertently rediscovered by Charles Messier on March 18, 1781, and added as the 92nd entry in his catalogue. William Herschel first resolved individual stars in 1783.

== Visibility ==
It is one of the brighter of its sort in apparent magnitude in the northern hemisphere and in its absolute magnitude in the galaxy, but it is often overlooked by amateur astronomers due to angular proximity to bright cluster Messier 13, about 20% closer. Though when compared to M13, M92 is only slightly less bright, but about 1/3 less extended. It is visible to the naked eye under very good viewing conditions. With a small telescope, M92 can be seen as a nebulous smudge even in a severely light-polluted sky, and can be further resolved in darker conditions. 

== Characteristics ==
It is also one of the galaxy&#x27;s oldest clusters. It is around above/below the galactic plane and from the Galactic Center. It is about 26,700 light-years away from the Solar System.The half-light radius, or radius containing the upper half of its light emission, is 1.09 arcminutes (), while the tidal radius, the broadest standard measure, is 15.17. It appears only slightly flattened: its minor axis is about 89% ± 3% of the major.

Characteristic of other globulars, it has little of the elements other than hydrogen and helium; astronomers term this low metallicity. Specifically, relative to the Sun, its iron abundance is [Fe/H] = –2.32 dex, which is 0.5% of 1.0, on this logarithmic scale, the solar abundance. This puts the estimated age range for the cluster at .

Its true diameter is 108 ly, and may have a mass corresponding to 330,000 suns.

The cluster is not yet in, nor guaranteed to undergo, core collapse and the core radius figures as about 2 arcseconds (). It is an Oosterhoff type II (OoII) globular cluster, which means it belongs to the group of metal-poor clusters with longer period RR Lyrae variable stars. The 1997 &quot;Catalogue of Variable Stars in Globular Clusters&quot; listed 28 candidate variable stars in the cluster, although only 20 have been confirmed. As of 2001, there are 17 known RR Lyrae variables in Messier 92. 10 X-ray sources have been detected within the 1.02 arcminute half-mass radius of the cluster, of which half are candidate cataclysmic variable stars.

M92 is approaching us at 112 km/sec. Its coordinates indicate that the Earth&#x27;s North Celestial Pole periodically passes less than one degree of this cluster during the precession of Earth&#x27;s axis. Thus, M92 was a &quot;Polarissima Borealis&quot;, or &quot;North Cluster&quot;, about 12,000 years ago (10,000 BC), and it will again in about 14,000 years (16,000 AD).&#x27;

The multiple stellar populations in this cluster, revealing that it hosts at least two stellar generations of stars named 1G and 2G, as well as two distinct groups of 2G stars (2GA and 2GB). The helium abundances of 2GA and 2GB stars have higher mass fractions than that of the 1G stars by 0.01 and 0.04, respectively.

<text>Geoje (; ) is a city located in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is located near Busan. Hanwha Ocean in Okpo and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) in Gohyeon are both located on Geoje Island. The city also offers a wide range of tourist sights. The city is made up of a number of islands, of which by far the largest is Geoje Island. There are multiple
dong in the city: Jangpyeongdong, Okpo-dong and Gohyeon.

==Etymology==
Geoje is Korean for &quot;great rescue&quot;, from the syllables &quot;geo&quot; () meaning great, and &quot;je&quot; () meaning rescue.

==History==
Geoje has a history stretching back thousands of years. Various artifacts dating back to the Neolithic era have been found at archaeological digs on Naedo, Sandaldo, and Isudo. While no written history can be found from this era, the digs show evidence of numerous small establishments along the coasts. The first written mention of Geoje appears as, Geoje being one of two main divisions of the Dokro kingdom, a member of the Byeonhan confederacy (circa 0-300 AD). The Byeonhan confederacy slowly gave way to the Gaya confederacy(42-562 AD). The Gaya eventually submitted to the Kingdom of Silla.

In 757, Gyeongdeok of Silla classified the island as &quot;Geoje-gun&quot; &quot;&quot; (Geoje county). Modern Geoje is classified as a &quot;si&quot; () (city). In 1170, Uijong of Goryeo secretly escaped to Geoje when Chŏng Chung-bu raised a rebellion against him, instating his brother, Myeongjong as king. Geoje served as a strategic location in preparation of the naval forces for the Gihae Eastern Expedition () of Tsushima Island in 1419 by the Korean general Yi Jong Mu. At the time of the Seven-Year War in 1592, admiral Yi Sun-sin gained a great naval victory against Japanese invaders near the town of Okpo in Geoje. Since then. Yi was referred to by his noble title, &quot;Chung Mu Gong,&quot; which roughly translates into English as &quot;Earner of Great National Respect.&quot;

In the Korean War (1950–53), the military government of General Douglas MacArthur used the island as a place for the settlement for 170,000 POWs, and a Prisoner of war camp measuring at was established during these years. The prison was rife with human rights abuses, including summary execution and the widespread use of torture against prisoners by Canadian and American troops. British journalist Alan Winnington and Australian journalist Wilfred Burchett conducted extensive research to document these human rights abuses, and jointly published their findings in 1952. After the war, a portion (23,000 m2) was converted into a tourist attraction.

During the last few decades Geoje has emerged as leader in the shipbuilding industries. Due to the continued industry, Geoje largely escaped the negative impacts of the Asian market crash of 1997.

Some notable people from Geoje include: 
*Former President Kim Young-sam
*Poet Yu Chi-hwan, better known by his pen-name Cheongma.
*Former President Moon Jae-in

==Demographics==
According to the whitebook published by Geoje City in May 2014, Geoje had a population of 243,736, 12,240 of which are foreigners (non-Koreans). A significant portion of the population depends on shipbuilding to support their livelihood, and this can be evidenced by the fact that nearly 33% of workers are employed in the shipbuilding industry.

Tourists also visit Jisim-do for trekking. Jisim is known for its Camellia vegetation. However, the Maemi typhoon in 2003 severely affected the island&#x27;s plant life. Another popular tourist attraction at Haegeumgang-do (located southeast of Geoje) is the Sipja Donggul Cave. Buddhist and Shamanist sculptures can be found in the cave.

Geoje is the second largest island in Korea, so discovering these locations is most easily done using a tourist map.

<text>Kenneth Milton Grimwood (February 27, 1944 – June 6, 2003) was an American author, who also published work under the name of Alan Cochran. In his fantasy fiction, Grimwood combined themes of life-affirmation and hope with metaphysical concepts, themes found in his best-known novel, &quot;Replay&quot; (1986). It won the 1988 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel.

==Background==
Grimwood was born in Dothan, Alabama. His family moved to Pensacola, Florida, where he grew up. In his early years, Grimwood took an interest in EC Comics and radio journalism. He attended and graduated in 1961 from Indian Springs School, a private school near Birmingham, Alabama. That summer he went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. He attended Emory College in Atlanta from 1961 to 1963.

In the mid-1960s, Grimwood worked in news at WLAK in Lakeland, Florida. Heading north, he returned to college, studying psychology at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. He also contributed short fiction to Bard&#x27;s student publication, &quot;Observer&quot; in 1969, and graduated in 1970.

Grimwood moved to Los Angeles, California. He wrote some of his early novels while working as nightside editor at KFWB News 980 radio in the city. The success of &quot;Replay&quot; (1987) enabled him to leave that job and pursue writing full-time.

==Personal life==
Grimwood was married for a period; he and his wife did not have children.

Among his friends was Tom Atwill (a relative of the actor Lionel Atwill). Atwill described Grimwood&#x27;s &quot;free spirit lifestyle&quot; and recalled, 
==&quot;Breakthrough&quot;==
Grimwood&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Breakthrough&quot; (Ballantine, 1976), is a blend of science fiction, reincarnation and horror elements that concluded with an unpredictable twist ending. Cured of epilepsy by a breakthrough in medical technology, 26-year-old Elizabeth Austin has miniature electrodes implanted in her brain. She can control her seizures by pressing an external remote to activate the electrodes. Adjusting to a normal life, she is ready to patch up a troubled marriage and resume her abandoned career. However, as part of the implant operation, Elizabeth gave her consent for the insertion of extra electrodes, featuring experimental functions unknown to science. When one of those electrodes is stimulated, Elizabeth experiences memories which are not her own. She discovers the remote has given her the ability to eavesdrop on her previous life 200 years in the past, and she keeps this a secret from her doctor. Intrigued, she finds the earlier existence appealing and begins to spend more and more time there. Eventually, she discovers that the woman in the past is a murderess who is plotting to kill Elizabeth&#x27;s husband in the present. 

In writing this novel, Grimwood did extensive research into brain surgery and epilepsy.

==&quot;Two Plus Two&quot;==
Grimwood used the pseudonym Alan Cochran for his novel &quot;Two Plus Two&quot; (Doubleday, 1980). The storyline follows two Los Angeles detectives investigating a trio of murders that they learn involve members of a swingers club.

==&quot;Replay&quot;==
Grimwood&#x27;s novel &quot;Replay&quot; (Arbor House, 1986), explored the life of 43-year-old radio journalist Jeff Winston after his death. He awakens in 1963 in his 18-year-old body. He begins to relive his life with intact memories of the previous 25 years. This happens repeatedly with different events in each cycle.

In this novel, Grimwood refers back and offers a clue to the identity of the author of &quot;Two Plus Two&quot;: in one passage the main character of &quot;Replay&quot; hides his identity by using the name &quot;Alan Cochran&quot;.

The time-loop concept of &quot;Replay&quot; has been referred to as a precursor of Harold Ramis&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993), starring Bill Murray.
===Reception===
The novel was a bestseller in Japan, and it won the 1988 World Fantasy Award.

The novel was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. In the succeeding years, it has been included in several lists of recommended reading: &quot;Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels&quot; (1988), Aurel Guillemette&#x27;s &quot;The Best in Science Fiction&quot; (1993), David Pringle&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction&quot; (1995) and the &quot;Locus&quot; Reader&#x27;s Poll: Best Science Fiction Novel (1988). In the &quot;Locus&quot; 1998 poll of the best fantasy novels published prior to 1990, &quot;Replay&quot; placed #32. On the Internet Top 100 SF/Fantasy List, &quot;Replay&quot; was voted to the #43 position in 2000 but climbed to #19 by 2003.

Critic Daniel D. Shade reviewed the novel in 2001:

In 1986 the agent Irene Webb (then at the William Morris Agency, which still represents Grimwood&#x27;s work) sold the film rights to &quot;Replay&quot; to United Artists for a $100,000 option against a $400,000 purchase.

==&quot;Into the Deep&quot;==
Grimwood explored his fascination with cetacean intelligence, encounters with dolphins and research into intraspecies dolphin communication for his novel &quot;Into the Deep&quot; (William Morrow, 1995). It is about a marine biologist struggling to crack the code of dolphin intelligence. It features lengthy passages written from the point of view of several dolphin characters. To research &quot;the willful denial and gratuitous cruelty&quot; involved in tuna fishing, Grimwood secretly infiltrated the crew of a tuna boat based in San Diego, California.

The publisher described the book:
==Other works==

Other novels include &quot;The Voice Outside&quot; (1982), exploring mind control and telepathy-inducing drugs; and &quot;Elise&quot; (1979). Born in Versailles in 1683, Elise is immortal because of her DNA. The story traces her experiences with various lovers and husbands through the centuries. &quot;Elise&quot; is now regarded as a rare book and sells at collector prices.

==Death==
At age 59, Grimwood died of a heart attack at his home in Santa Barbara, California. In this period, he was working on a sequel to &quot;Replay&quot;. He is included in the &quot;Guide to Santa Barbara Authors and Publishers&quot; at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There is at least one unpublished Grimwood novel, a collaboration with Tom Atwill.

<text>William Morris Lawry (born 11 February 1937) is an Australian former cricketer and commentator who played for Victoria and Australia. He captained Australia in 25 Test matches, winning nine, losing eight and drawing eight, and led Australia in the inaugural One Day International match, played in 1971. Following his retirement, Lawry spent over 40 years as a commentator on Channel 9, and is considered as one of the game’s most iconic voices.

A left-handed opening batsman with a reputation for resolute defence, he had the ability to spend long periods of time at the crease. As his career progressed, he wound back his strokeplay to the point where he was described by an English journalist as &quot;the corpse with pads on&quot;. Lawry was unceremoniously dumped as captain and player for the final Test of the 1970–71 Ashes series in Australia. Lawry&#x27;s sacking is regarded as one of the more distasteful incidents in Australian cricket history—he was not informed personally of the selectors&#x27; decision before the decision was first broadcast on radio and he only became aware of his fate when confronted by reporters. Lawry was part of the Nine Network cricket commentary team until 2018, by which time he had been in the role for 45 years.

==Early career==
Lawry was born in the Melbourne suburb of Thornbury. He was given the names William Morris after the early Prime Minister of Australia, William Morris Hughes. His father Alfred played amateur cricket until the age of 51. Bill never saw his father play, who was aged 47 when Bill was born. Aged nine, he played competitive cricket for the first time with the Thornbury Presbyterian Church team. He spent three years there, as well as playing for Preston Technical School. When he was twelve, he entered Melbourne&#x27;s district competition playing for Northcote&#x27;s fourth team, working his way up to the First XI by the age of sixteen. At the time, he was apprenticed as a plumber and attending Preston Technical College. Lawry was selected for Victoria&#x27;s Second XI at the age of seventeen. He made a duck against the South Australians and did not see any further action for the Seconds for the rest of the summer of 1954–55. The following season, Lawry was recalled to the Seconds and scored 183 against South Australia.

A few months before turning nineteen, Lawry made his debut for Victoria, against Western Australia at the Junction Oval in the 1955–56 season. He scored only three as the hosts took an innings victory and it was his only senior match of the season. He played in all but one of Victoria&#x27;s matches in 1956–57, but had modest results. He passed fifty only twice, scoring 51 against Queensland in his fourth first-class match, and making 74 against South Australia two games later. He made only one and seven against arch-rivals New South Wales in a low-scoring match that ended in the first tie in Sheffield Shield competitions. He ended with only 248 runs at 20.66.

Lawry was dropped completely in 1957–58 and did not play a match for his state even though they were depleted with Test representatives overseas in South Africa. The left-hander stayed on the sidelines for the first half of the following season when the Test players returned. Recalled for Victoria&#x27;s match against the touring English cricket team in 1958–59, he scored 24 and 22, failing to seize his opportunity against international opponents. He also bowled at first-class level for the first time, bowling two overs without success. However, he was retained in the team, and scored fifties in four of the remaining five innings of the season and ended with 361 runs at 60.16.

In 1959–60, the national team were away on an eight-Test tour of the Indian subcontinent, opening up opportunities for players in domestic cricket. Lawry played in all 10 of Victoria&#x27;s inter-state matches. After starting the season with 70 and 50 not out against Western Australia, Lawry went into a form slump and accumulated only 56 runs in his next six innings. He scored 85 and 33 and took his maiden first-class wicket in the next match against South Australia, but his form remained modest until the end of the season. He scored fifties in consecutive matches before registering his maiden first-class century, 127, against Western Australia, before scoring an unbeaten 38 in the second innings to see the Victorians to their target of 46. He ended with 666 runs at 44.40 for the season.

His batting form remained modest at the start of the 1960–61 season, scoring only 148 runs in the first seven innings of the summer. In the first match of the season against South Australia, he took a wicket in each innings, the only time he took more than one wicket in a first-class match. His summer&#x27;s total of two wickets was the most he ever took in a season.

He made his major breakthrough in the fifth match of the season when he hit 266 (after being dropped on 12) against New South Wales at Sydney in 1960–61, shortly before the Australian selectors chose the team for the 1961 Ashes tour. It was more than half of his team&#x27;s 4/457. Lawry followed his double-century with scores of 66, 83 and 85 in consecutive innings, and then ended the interstate season with a 134 against Queensland. He had scored 840 runs at 56.00 up to that point in the season and was selected for the tour of England. He scored 202 runs at 50.50 in three warm-up matches before the Australians departed for the British Isles.

==Test debut==
Lawry was sent to England as a backup opening batsman for the incumbent pair of Colin McDonald and Bob Simpson, who had performed well against the pace attack of the West Indies during the previous season and were expected to be retained for the Tests. Adapting quickly to English pitches, Lawry bounced back after failing to pass 30 in his first two matches to make his first century on the tour against Surrey at The Oval, which defeated Australia in the corresponding match on Australia&#x27;s previous tour in 1956. This time, Lawry seized the initiative in an innings described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;one of the most significant of the whole season&quot; and &quot;a flowering of technique and temperament&quot;. Batting for four and a half hours, Lawry scored 165, reaching his century in three hours. He compiled 101 runs between lunch and tea, producing an array of powerful drives through the off side, while his hooking prompted Denis Compton to compare him to Don Bradman. The Australians took a 180-run first innings lead and the Victorian opener made 22 not out to seal a ten-wicket win in the second innings. Lawry followed up with 100 and 24 not out in a nine-wicket triumph against Cambridge University and 104 on his first appearance at Lord&#x27;s, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), who boasted several Test players in their ranks. Continuing this form in the second innings, Lawry hit 84 and combined with Simpson (92*) to take Australia to 0/186, whereupon they declared and bowled the hosts out to win the match. He added 72 against Oxford University, and in eight matches leading into the Tests, Lawry had totalled 720 runs at 80.00.

Consequently, the selectors moved Simpson down the order to number six to accommodate Lawry for his Test debut in First Test at Edgbaston. In a drawn match, he made a steady 57 in Australia&#x27;s only innings of 9/516 declared. Between Tests, he added an even 100 against Kent. His innings in the Second Test at Lord&#x27;s—dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Ridge&quot;—was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;an indomitable effort of sheer graft under severe pressure with the ball flying about&quot;. Taking bruising blows from the hostile pace bowling of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham on a pitch with irregular bounce due to the presence of a ridge, Lawry reached 32 at stumps on the first day after England were bowled out for 206. The following day, Australia moved from 4/111 at lunch to 5/183 when Peter Burge was dismissed for 46 with Lawry on 99. Lawry resisted for six hours, to register his maiden Test century of 130, while no other batsman on either side passed 66. It helped Australia to take a match-winning first innings lead, eventually leaving a target in the double figures for the second innings. It was his fifth hundred of the tour, giving him over a thousand runs inside two months. Lawry continued his fine form in the two matches before the next Test, scoring 70 and 35 against Somerset and 122 against Lancashire. In the latter match, he took 1/24 from four overs, his only first-class stint with the ball during the whole tour, and his heaviest bowling workload in a first-class match.

Lawry then scored a pair of 28s as England squared the series at 1–1 in the Third Test in a low-scoring, three-day encounter at Headingley. He then scored against Northamptonshire. In the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, Lawry played a part of innings that was crucial in Australia winning the series. After making 74 in the first innings, he and Simpson put on an opening partnership of 113 in the second, the first century opening partnership of the series. Lawry went on to make 102, helping to set a match-winning target before skittling England on the final afternoon.

After the match-winning performance in Manchester, the latter stages of Lawry&#x27;s tour were comparatively unproductive. He made a duck in his only innings in the drawn final Test at The Oval, and scored 109 against the Gentlemen of England, but made only two fifties in the last six first-class fixtures of the tour.

Nevertheless, Lawry topped the batting aggregates with 2,019 runs at 61.18 in first-class matches and 420 at 52.50 in five Tests. He struck the most centuries on tour, with nine triple-figure scores. Only Bradman and Neil Harvey had made over two thousand runs in an English tour since the Second World War. As a result, he was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1962.

==Later career==
===1961-62===
Upon his return to Australia, he became the captain of Victoria for the 1961–62 season following the retirement of Test opener McDonald. A purely domestic season in 1961–62 saw Lawry in charge of his state for a full season. It was not a happy start for the new Victorian leader, as his men lost their first four matches. It was not until his fifth match in charge, against minnows Tasmania—who were not in the Sheffield Shield competition at the time—that the Victorians tasted victory. When the Shield competition resumed, Lawry&#x27;s men were dealt a ten-wicket defeat and it was not until the next match, the sixth in the competition, that they avoided defeat, managed a draw against Queensland. The new skipper ended the season on a winning note, with an innings triumph over South Australia and seven-wicket victory over Western Australia. In spite of his team&#x27;s poor form, Lawry remained productive with the bat, particularly against the dominant New South Wales, whose many Test players swept them to a ninth successive Shield title. The left-handed opener was one of the few to perform against the champions, scoring 65 and 113, and 97 and 67 in the respective matches, accumulating more than a third of his team&#x27;s runs. He scored centuries in both matches against South Australia and ended with three triple-figures scores and three fifties for the season. In all, the Victorian skipper scored 832 runs at 51.68.

===1962-63===
Lawry made his Test debut on Australian soil in the First Test of the 1962–63 Ashes series at Brisbane. After making half-centuries in consecutive lead-in matches, he narrowly missed making a century in the drawn series opener, being dismissed for 98 in the second innings. Between Tests, Lawry scored 177 and 26 in a losing effort against the MCC for Victoria, and then made 133 in the next match against New South Wales, helping Victoria to an eight-wicket win, although he was jeered by an impatient gallery fed up with his slow batting.

The Second Test, his first in his home town of Melbourne saw two 50s, but an unhappy result as Australia went 1–0 down after losing by seven wickets. Lawry did not pass fifty again in the series, ending the drawn series with 310 runs at 34.44. Australian crowds became impatient with his dour and defiant style of batting. In the Fifth Test, Lawry had been ordered by captain Richie Benaud to occupy the crease and play out for a draw. He obliged with an unbeaten 45 in four hours on the final day, even though &quot;the crowd booed, barracked and slow-clapped&quot;. At one point, he struck two fours in succession, prompting the crowd to yell &quot;lightning does strike twice!&quot; The unbeaten knock was part of barren run of 12 innings in which Lawry passed 20 only twice. The Victorian captain played in five of his state&#x27;s Shield matches as they won the title and ended New South Wales&#x27; nine-year run. He ended the Australian season with 990 runs at 39.60.

===1963-64===
1963–64 saw a tour to Australia by South Africa. Lawry began well with 43 and 87* in a drawn First Test at Brisbane overshadowed by the no-balling of Ian Meckiff. Between Tests, the Victorian skipper continued his strong run with 73 and 130 not against Queensland and 94 against New South Wales. He then made his first century on home soil with 157 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the first innings of the Second Test. This helped propel Australia to a 173-run first innings lead and an eventual eight-wicket win that gave them a 1–0 lead. He made another half century in the Third Test in Sydney, scoring 89 in the second innings to help Australia to a safe position after they had ceded a 42-run first innings lead. Lawry then struck an unbeaten 187 for Victoria against the South Africans, but his form tailed away in the remaining two Tests, scoring 77 runs in the last two matches as the tourists won the Fourth Test by ten wickets to square the series. He ended the series with 496 runs at 55.11. The series was highlighted by new ball battles between Lawry and South African pace spearhead Peter Pollock. Pollock attempted to repeatedly bounce Lawry out, but removed Lawry in only three of ten innings. Pollock later nominated Lawry as one of the two hardest openers that he had ever bowled to. The Victorian skipper ended his Sheffield Shield campaign with 119 in a ten-wicket triumph over Western Australia but it was not enough for his team to hold onto their titles. He totalled 1340 runs at 67.00 for the season.

===1964===
1964 saw Lawry return to England, the venue of his first Test series. He started where he left off last time, scoring 50 and 79 against Worcestershire and 106 and 39 not out against Gloucestershire in the first two matches. However, his runs dried up in the three weeks leading up to the Tests, scoring only 119 runs in seven innings.

After failing to pass 20 in the first two Tests, he scored 78 in the first innings of the Third Test at Headingley, in which Australia took a 121-run first innings lead and went on to win by seven wickets to take a 1–0 series lead. With Australia only needing a draw in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford to retain the Ashes, Lawry scored 106, combining in a double century opening stand with Simpson which laid the platform for a total of 8/656 in over two days, as Australia batted England out of the match. The tourists&#x27; strategy was simply to bat as long as possible and to prevent any prospect of an English victory. The match only reached the second over of Australia&#x27;s second innings, leading Wisden to note &quot;a bad taste was left in the mouth of the cricket enthusiasts.&quot; Lawry proceeded to make 94 in the Fifth Test at The Oval, helping to secure a 197-run first innings lead and draw the match, retaining the Ashes 1–0. He ended with series with 317 runs at 39.62. Lawry had struggled in the tour matches between the Tests; in 11 innings, he made three 60s and seven scores below 20. AFter the Tests were over, Lawry was prolific, passing fifty six times in the eight innings of the last fourst first-class matches. This included centuries in each of the last three matches, 101 not out, 110 and 121 against Kent, AER Gilligan&#x27;s XI and TN Pearce&#x27;s XI respectively.

He made five centuries in the first-class matches on the tour.

===1964-65===
Australia made a visit to the Indian subcontinent on the way back home during the 1964–65 season, and the four Tests were the only fixtures scheduled. Lawry batted consistently and defiantly against the Indian spin attack led by Bhagwat Chandrasekhar in three Tests, compiling three half centuries and two 40s without managing to convert any into a century. Five of his six innings yielded between 47 and 68 runs. He ended the series with 284 runs at 56.80 as the series ended 1–1. In the same season Lawry failed to pass fifty in two one-off home and away Tests against Pakistan, aggregating 89 runs at 22.50 in four innings. The one-off Test was the only international match that Australia hosted in 1964–65 season, allowing the Victorian to lead his state in seven of their eight Shield matches. Lawry was in fine form, striking four centuries, including triple-figure scores in both matches against South Australia. He made an unbeaten 143 in the second innings of the states&#x27; first meeting, staving off defeat after the Victorians fell 248 runs behind after the first innings. He then scored 246 and 87 not out in the second match to set up a 111-run win. His team was not so successful, winning two and losing one of the seven matches. Lawry ended the Sheffield Shield campaign with 788 runs at 98.50.

The season ended with a tour to the West Indies. He managed only 79 runs in five innings in the first three Tests as Australia trailed 2–0, as both he and Simpson struggled against the express pace of Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith on grounds with no sightscreens.

However, they recovered to combine in a 382-run partnership in the Fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados. Lawry went on to make 210, his highest Test score, and added a further unbeaten 58 in the second innings of a high-scoring draw before Australia declared. This proved to be rather risky, as the hosts were only 10 runs short of the target when time ran out, but in any case, the draw was enough to ensure an unassailable 2–0 series lead. Primarily due to that match, he ended the series with 368 runs at 52.57, having made only 3 and 18 not out in the ten-wicket win in a low-scoring Fifth Test. Lawry was consistent in the tour matches against the various countries of the West Indies, his lowest score being 49 in six innings. He made 62 and 134 not out against Trinidad and Tobago and ended with 423 runs at 84.60 in these matches.

===1965-66===
Lawry had one of his best seasons in the 1965–66 Ashes series and &quot;always seemed to be batting&quot;, his 592 runs (84.57) were the most in an Ashes series since Don Bradman in 1946–47 and his three centuries the most since Arthur Morris in 1948. He was in fine form in the four lead-up matches, hitting 160 in the opening game of the season against South Australia and 153 and 61 for the Victorians against the Englishmen. The Victorian skipper added fifties in the other two matches.

His 166 in the First Test in Brisbane helped Australia, in the absence of the incapacitated and unavailable Simpson, to set a total of 6/443 declared and force England to follow on, but they managed to hold on for a draw. Lawry continued his run scoring in the Second Test at Melbourne, compiling 88 in the first innings. Australia ceded a 200-run first innings lead and he made 78 in the second innings to help the hosts to 426 and safety. In the Third Test, Simpson was again sidelined and Lawry failed; his duck and 33 coincided with Australia losing the match in Sydney by an innings. After the match, Brian Booth, who was the regular vice-captain of the team to Simpson, and led the team in the First and Third Tests, was sacked after a barren run with the bat, and Lawry became the deputy. Between Tests, the Victorian ran into form in a match for the Tasmania Combined XI against England. He made 47 as the hosts collapsed for 199 in their first innings and then compiled an unbeaten 126 in the second innings to help wipe out a deficit of 272 and prevent defeat. Lawry scored 119 after combining in a record opening stand of 244 with Simpson in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to help level the series with an innings victory, the highest opening partnership for Australia against England and still the highest opening partnership against England at home. A further 108 in a 212 run stand with Bob Cowper in the Fifth Test helped ensure the match was drawn and the Ashes retained. Lawry scored 592 runs at 84.58. Including the tour matches against England, Lawry scored 979 runs at 97.90 against the touring side, occupying the crease for over 41 hours in a typically attritional style.

====The 1965-66 Victorian District Cricket final====
Lawry continued his marathon season with a remarkable performance in the final of the Victorian district cricket season, playing for Northcote Cricket Club against the Essendon Cricket Club. In 2000, the Victorian Cricket Association&#x27;s Umpires Association voted it &quot;The District Match of the Century&quot;. The Essendon team included Ian Monks (captain), John Grant, Greg Brown, Barry Davis, Daryl Foster, Keith Kirby, and John Swanson; and, apart from Lawry, the team&#x27;s captain, the Northcote team included Frank Brew, Ian Cowley, Tom Ryan and Paul Shanahan.
::There was nothing unusual about Bill Lawry pulling off seemingly unending rearguard actions, but his marathon innings in the Victoria Cricket Association Premiership final of 1965-66 was perhaps the most outrageously unbelievable.&quot;
The match was played at the Albert Cricket Ground over four days — 2 April 9 April (Easter Saturday), 11 April (Easter Monday), and 16 April 1966 — to reach a first innings result: Essendon declared at 9/514 at tea on Day 2, and Northcote chased the total, making 5/516, with Lawry finishing 282 not out, having been at the crease for 509 minutes, faced 454 balls, and hit 32 fours.

===1966-67===
He was less successful in 1966–67 as Australia toured South Africa and lost the five Test series 3–1. In his first trip to Africa, Lawry struggled. In five first-class matches leading up to the Tests, he made starts without converting them into big scores, scoring 334 runs at 41.75 with four scores between 35 and 60.

Lawry&#x27;s best score was 98 in the First Test in Johannesburg, which ended in defeat. Lawry&#x27;s innings took Australia to a 126-run first innings lead, but the hosts made 620 in their second innings. Lawry then made 27 as Australia collapsed to a 333-run loss. His Test series performance declined as the tour went on, failing to pass 45 again and only managing 44 runs in his last four innings as the hosts dominated the series. He aggregated 296 runs at 29.60. He did have some success in the three remaining first-class matches, passing 50 in each one, including a 107 against Griqualand West. In the match against Orange Free State, the Victorian claimed his first wicket at first-class level for six years. In a limited-overs match against the South African XI, he struck 91 out of Australia&#x27;s 8/323 but the hosts scraped home by three wickets.

==Captaincy==
Lawry started the 1967–68 home series against India well. After compiling 42 and a duck in the First Test win, he made an even 100 in the Second Test in Adelaide to help secure an innings victory. After the Test, Lawry became Australian captain when Simpson stood aside having announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the series. His form remained consistent, scoring 64, 45, 66 and 52 in the two remaining Tests as Australia completed a 4–0 clean sweep. He had a productive summer with 369 runs at 52.71. In all first-class matches, Lawry made 805 runs at 47.35, adding a second century for the season in a vain attempt to prevent a Victorian defeat at the hands of Western Australia. Throughout the summer, Lawry made many start without converting them into large scores. In 17 innings, he made six half-centuries, all less than 70, and four scores in the forties. Under his leadership, Victoria won three and lost two of their seven Shield matches for the season.

Lawry&#x27;s first full series in command was the 1968 Ashes tour of England. With Simpson now retired, the Australians were expected to struggle. The new Australian captain was in good touch in the opening tour matches, scoring three fifties in consecutive innings and aggregating 258 runs at 51.60 in a series of six rain-truncated lead-in matches.

He scored 81 in the first innings of the First Test as Australia took a 192-run advantage and complete a 159-run win to take a 1–0 lead. After failing in the next two drawn Tests, Lawry missed three weeks of cricket and the Fourth Test having sustained a broken finger in the previous Test. Up to this point, Australia had maintained their series lead against the run of play, aided by rain. In the Second Test, Lawry made a duck as Australia fell for 78, their lowest score since World War II. In the second innings he made 28 in Australia&#x27;s 4/127. The tourists still needed 146 runs to make the hosts bat again, and were saved by rain, which washed out more than half the playing time. In the Third Test, Lawry was forced to retire hurt on six as Australia to England&#x27;s 409 with 222. Due to inclement weather, England declared 329 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand and the Australians were 1/68 when the rain-shortened match ended.

In his absence, Barry Jarman led the team and adopted ultra-defensive tactics at the orders of Lawry, playing for a draw that guaranteed Australia would retain the Ashes. Lawry returned and made 27 and 46 in county matches before the final Fifth Test at The Oval.

In the first innings, he scored 135 in seven and a half hours as Australia fell behind by 170 runs. The innings was the first time that Lawry attracted the derisive description of a &quot;corpse with pads on&quot;. In the second innings, he made four as Australia collapsed to be all out for 125 and lose by 226 runs. Rain had again threatened to deny England but they managed to finish off the tourists with five minutes to spare. He finished the series with 270 runs at 38.57. Lawry also struggled for form in the tour matches after the start of the Tests, with only one century and fifty in 12 innings, including 135 against Essex.

The five-Test series against the West Indies at home in 1968–69 saw the peak of Lawry&#x27;s career as a batsman. After a fortuitous retention of the Ashes and patchy form in England, Lawry was back in form on Australian soil.

After registering a century and a fifty in five lead-in matches, he made 109 in the First Test in Brisbane but was unable to prevent defeat, as Australia trailed in a series for the first time under his leadership. He responded with 205 in the Second Test at Melbourne, setting up a total of 510 after asking the tourists to bat first and forcing an innings victory to square the series. After the Third Test saw a convincing ten-wicket victory, the captain making 29 in the first innings, Lawry scored 62 and 89 in a drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide. With Australia needing 360 to win, the captain got them off to a good start but they fell away and the last pair had to survive 26 balls at the end to save the match, 21 runs adrift of the target.

With the series at 2–1 leading into the Fifth Test in Sydney, Lawry struck 151 in the first innings after Australia were sent in to bat. The hosts made 619 and took a 340-run first innings lead, but their cautious captain let his team bat until they reached 8/394 to declare with a lead of 734, making 17 runs himself. The Australians still had enough time to take 382-run win and complete a 3–1 series win. His 667 runs at 83.38 was the highest series aggregate of his career. Lawry had expected a pace onslaught after Australia&#x27;s last trip to the Caribbean had ended in defeat, but Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith had begun to slow down, taking their wickets at an average over 40.

===India in 1969–70: historic win and riots===
Lawry&#x27;s last success as captain came during the five-Test tour to India in 1969–70. The 3–1 win was to be Australia&#x27;s last Test series victory in India for 35 years, standing out among a series of subsequent failed attempts by Australian leaders to conquer the subcontinent. However, at the time, Lawry and Australia&#x27;s victory was overshadowed by the public relations disasters that beset the tour.

The tour started with a stop in Ceylon, where the Australians played three non-limited-overs one-day matches and an unofficial Test. They won one of the one-dayers and the others were drawn, with much time lost to tropical downpours. Lawry made three fifties in his five innings.

Before the Tests got underway, Australia faced West Zone, and the skipper made 89 in a drawn match. Aside from the five Tests, the tourists would also play each of the five zones once. The First Test in Bombay saw Australia take a lead of 74 runs on the first innings. The match was marred by a controversial umpiring decision on the fourth day when Srinivas Venkataraghavan was given out caught behind in the second innings after missing the ball by roughly a foot. Most of the Australian players were dissatisfied with the events, feeling that the batsman had been robbed. In the meantime, the public address system declared that Lawry and his men had cheated. It resulted in crowd rioting and the crowd started to shout &quot;Lawry, Lawry, Lawry&quot;. The spectators lit fires and threw projectiles at the Australians after Lawry refused to adjourn the match, contrary to police advice that warned them to run for their lives. During the chaos, Johnny Gleeson was hit in the head by a bottle, and when the teams left the field at the end of the Indian innings, Lawry was hit by a flying chair. Australia went on to reach the target of 64 and win by eight wickets after the Indians fell for 137, sparking off another riot. Former Indian captain Lala Amarnath defended Lawry, saying that he was not responsible for the umpiring error. Ajit Wadekar, who played in the match, said that &quot;With a little graciousness, the unfortunate episode...could have been avoided&quot;. He said that an Australian win was inevitable, so Lawry should have adjourned the game and defused the riot. In another incident, Lawry threw his baggy green cap on the ground after the umpires adjourned play for the luncheon interval; Lawry felt that there was time for one more over. The Australian captain was not prominent with the bat in his team&#x27;s win; he made 25 and 2.

After scoring 22 in an innings win over Central Zone, the teams played in the Second Test in Kanpur. Lawry made 14 in the first innings and was on 56 in the second innings as Australia reached 0/95 after the Indians set them 285 to win during the final day. After the drawn Test, Lawry rested himself from the match against North Zone.

The teams proceeded to Delhi for the Third Test. Australia batted first and took a 73-run lead on a spinning surface, although their captain only managed six. In the second innings, Lawry became the sixth Australian to carry the bat in Tests, making an unbeaten 49 as Australia collapsed for 107 against the spin of Bishan Singh Bedi and Erapalli Prasanna. Australia were confident that the Indians would not be able to make the target of 181 on a deteriorating pitch after 19 wickets had fallen for 167 on the second day. However, following the rest day, India comfortably won the match by seven wickets to square the series. Australian spinner Ashley Mallett claimed that India&#x27;s Ashok Mankad later admitted that the hosts had switched the pitches on the rest day so they could bat on a favourable pitch. Australia then completed a 96-run win over East Zone in Guwahati, Lawry making 37 and 30.

During the Fourth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta, a surge in the demand for tickets caused a last day stampede, which resulted in running battles between fans and police, leaving six dead and hundred injured. This was exacerbated by protests by the Communist Party of India (CPI), a major political party in West Bengal, against Australian batsman Doug Walters. Walters had been conscripted during the Vietnam War period, although he was never sent to Vietnam to fight against the communist Viet Cong. Nevertheless, CPI activists erected posters across the city claiming that Walters had killed women and children. Around 10,000 communists picketed the Australian hotel and some eventually broke in and vandalised it.

On the field, after Lawry made 35 of Australia&#x27;s 335 to create a 123-run lead, there were more riots following a second innings Indian batting collapse. Spectators on the top deck of the stands threw rocks, prompting those in the lower stands to invade the playing arena. This interrupted Australia&#x27;s pursuit of 39 runs for victory, which was achieved without the loss of a wicket. During the stoppage, Lawry had an on-field altercation with a local photographer who had run onto the ground, pushing the pressman away with his bat. The Indian newspapers reported that Lawry had knocked the man over and then struck him with his bat. Lawry and his batting partner Keith Stackpole claimed that he had tried to shepherd the photographer from the playing area, who then stumbled and fell histrionically. The Australians reached their target of 39 with Lawry on 17 and all their wickets intact.

In any case, the crowd responded by stoning the Australian team bus as they left the ground following their victory. Following the incident, the Indian media began to wear black armbands and incited the populace against the Australians.

Even in the non-international tour matches, Lawry&#x27;s team could not escape controversy. The next match against South Zone at Bangalore generated more allegations of cheating. Australia&#x27;s reserve wicketkeeper Ray Jordon claimed that Alan Connolly had bowled Prasanna. Prasanna disagreed but eventually walked after Jordon repeatedly insisted that he was out. The Australians then had an altercation in the dressing room after some members accused Jordon of cheating, asserting that the delivery had missed the stumps. Lawry scored 120 in the first innings, his only century of the tour, as his colleagues collapsed to be all out for 195. This gave South a 44-run lead and they declared at 6/255 on the final day. Australia needed to bat for only two hours on the final day to salvage a draw, but a collapse had them at 8/90 with an hour left with Lawry still at the crease. Gleeson came out to bat and talked with both umpires at length before taking guard; he later claimed to teammates that he had threatened to hit the umpires in the head if they gave him out. Gleeson then padded every ball away without attempting a shot, but every leg before wicket appeal was rejected. In an attempt to waste time, Lawry pulled away from the wicket when a woman in a colourful sari walked into front of the sightscreen, leading to allegations that he had insulted Indian womanhood. In any case, the crowd expressed dismay at the Australian tactics by rioting and throwing rocks at the players. The match ended early because of the crowd trouble and Australia avoided being the first international team to lose to an Indian zone.

Following the match, many former Australian players called for the tour to be abandoned, citing the safety of the team. Nevertheless, the series continued and Lawry&#x27;s men received a positive welcome upon arrival for the Fifth Test in Madras. Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry&#x27;s team left India with Australia&#x27;s reputation severely dented. Perhaps as a result of the controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated &quot;It was the toughest tour I&#x27;ve ever been on. There were very pleasant memories on the field, but very unpleasant ones from the accommodation, the type of travel, the food we were getting and lack of support we were getting from the board.&quot;

Following the tour, Lawry wrote a series of newspaper articles that criticised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and their treatment of the Australian team. The BCCI complained to the Australian Board of Control, objecting to Lawry&#x27;s &quot;exaggerated and baseless&quot; statements. The ABC replied to express &quot;appreciation at the high level of hospitality and interested exhibited by Indian cricket authorities and the public&quot;. Lawry&#x27;s official report to the board criticised the level of security and insurance for the players. Lawry said

===Whitewashed by South Africa===

&quot;It was in South Africa in 1969–70 that his batting, and with it his captaincy, began to falter. The unfortunate experiences he and his men endured in India prior to visiting South Africa, those incidents there and on and off the field, began to affect his outlook, converted it, I feel, into what might be called an inlook...He had to survive investigation of his leadership by the Australian Board of Control in the light of adverse reports from the authorities of both India and South Africa. I believe Bill Lawry had developed a sizable chip on his shoulder before the summer of 1970–71.&quot;
:Richard Whitington
Lawry&#x27;s men left directly for South Africa. Already tired, they confronted fast and bouncy pitches in contrast to low, slow and dusty spinning pitches in India. Upon arrival, Lawry declared Ian Chappell to be the best batsman in the world, something that would come back to haunt him. For his part, the Australian commentator Alan McGilvray said that when they arrived in Johannesburg, the Australians &quot;looked haggard. Their eyes seemed to be standing out of their heads and some of them looked positively yellow.&quot; The Australians played their first match of the tour within a week of leaving the subcontinent. Prior to this first match, most of the team were seen sleeping on the benches at the ground half an hour before play was due to start. Initially, it appeared that the Australians were unaffected by the long campaign and change in conditions; they won their first two lead-in matches against their provincial sides by an innings and ten wickets respectively, Lawry scoring 86 against North Eastern Transvaal and 157 against Griqualand West, finishing unbeaten on both occasions. They drew the third match against Eastern Province, Lawry again unbeaten twice on 9 and 43.

After two weeks of preparation, the tour went awry for the Australians. They fell to a 170-run loss in the First Test in Cape Town, with Lawry giving finger gestures to the crowd and continuously arguing with the umpires. The Australian skipper managed only 2 in the first innings as the hosts took a 218-run lead that set up the match. Lawry scored 83 in the second innings, which was to be the highest Australian score for the series, an indication of his team&#x27;s lack of batting form. At the end of the match, angered by officiating that he considered to be unacceptable, Lawry refused to accept a presentation by the two umpires. The series moved on to Kingsmead at Durban. Host captain Ali Bacher outwitted Lawry by persuading the Australian skipper to toss long before the start of play. Bacher won the toss and decided—against conventional wisdom—to bat first on a green pitch that would normally offer assistance to the bowlers. Immediately after, ground staff ran onto the field and cut off all the grass, making it ideal for batting, thereby giving the South Africans the advantage. Knowing the rules in greater detail, Bacher had tricked Lawry. The laws of cricket allowed for the wicket to be mown up to half an hour before the start of play, so Bacher had talked Lawry in tossing early so that he could change the pitch condition to advantage his team. South Africa amassed 9/622 declared and Australia fell to its first innings defeat in four years, folding for 157 and 336. Lawry could not see off the hosts&#x27; opening bowlers, falling for 15 and 14, as South Africa took a 2–0 lead. The last two Tests brought no respite, as South Africa registered two large victories by 307 and 323 runs respectively. Lawry only managed 79 runs in the last two Tests, and passed 20 only once. Bacher&#x27;s side, which was regarded as one of the finest in Test history, had inflicted what remains the heaviest Test series defeat in Australian cricket history. Lawry&#x27;s men did not win any of the three matches against provincial sides after the start of the Tests, meaning that they went eight matches without victory.

In the four Tests, sixteen catches were dropped, with around 60 dropped in a total of 12 first-class matches, while the tired pace spearhead Graham McKenzie took 1/333 and was thought to be suffering from hepatitis. Behind the scenes, the South African Cricket Board approached the Australian Cricket Board attempting to organise a Fifth Test. The players were unreceptive to this after spending five months overseas in what was then an amateur sport. The proposed extra match fell through after a pay standoff led behind the scenes by Ian Chappell, later to spearhead the breakaway World Series Cricket (WSC), which offered players substantial remuneration. The dispute was the genesis of WSC, and on the team&#x27;s return to Australia, Lawry sent the Board a letter expressing player grievances. According to Chappell, &quot;That was the end of Lawry as captain of Australia. Then it was just a matter of finding any excuse to get rid of him.&quot; Lawry was largely ineffective, with 193 runs at 24.13 with only one half century in the First Test. Apart from media criticism of the team&#x27;s performances, Lawry was also slated for refusing to make a speech at the end of the series and refusing a gift from an umpire at the end of the Fourth Test. Lawry also had personal differences with Ian Chappell, Doug Walters, Ashley Mallett and Brian Taber, which reduced morale and led to a deterioration in Australia&#x27;s performances on the field.

===Sacking===

Bill Lawry, a defensive captain, had failed so far to defend the Ashes. Was he more likely to be able to regain the ascendancy? Of course not. Was he more likely to return to his former batting form, his early club and Shield batting form, if he were diplomatically relieved of the responsibility of leadership? Of course, yes. All the more likely if he were undiplomatically removed, because he would be nursing a grudge, burning to stage reprisals...
:Richard Whitington
The 1970–71 home series against England was the longest in Test history, with six Tests scheduled and another added when the Third Test was washed out. Lawry was to bow out of international cricket in one of the most acrimonious series in Test history. Lawry had gone through a difficult phase on the previous tour, with only 432 runs at 28.80 in nine Tests on the tour of India and South Africa. With Australia losing, and as a non-smoker and non-drinker, he became more distant from many of his own teammates. Lawry had been under pressure after a highly critical report by team manager Fred Bennett. Australia went to the series with confidence after the tourists were unable to win any of their four opening tour matches. Lawry had success in his preparation, scoring 87 and 58 not out in a ten-wicket win over Western Australia at the start of the season.

During the series, Lawry increasingly came under criticism for some uninspiring leadership marked by a safety-at-all-costs strategy. The First Test in Brisbane was drawn after both teams had passed 400 in the first innings, the visitors taking a 31-run lead, but not before Lawry had top-scored with 84 in the second innings as his team collapsed to be all out for 214. The Second Test was drawn after England made 397 and Australia replied with 440, Lawry making a duck and 38 not out as the hosts batted out the match in the second innings. The Third Test was washed out without a ball being bowled due to rain. In response to this, a Seventh Test was scheduled and the first-ever One Day International was scheduled in place of the washed out match. Australia won the inaugural match by five wickets with five overs to spare, Lawry making 27 in his only ODI.

In the Fourth Test at Sydney, England took a series lead with a 299-run win after taking a 106-run first innings lead and setting Australia 415 for victory. Lawry&#x27;s critics became more vocal, despite a defiant unbeaten 60 carrying his bat as Australia collapsed and fell for 116 in the second innings. It was England&#x27;s largest victory in terms of runs over Australia for 34 years. His own batting saw him described by Ian Wooldridge as &quot;a corpse with pads on&quot;. According to Ray Robinson, Lawry &quot;appeared to be expecting the worst and getting it often enough to expect more of the same&quot;. The selectors responded by axing both of Australia&#x27;s frontline pace duo of McKenzie and Connolly for the Fifth Test.

Lawry declared in the Fifth Test with Rod Marsh within eight runs of a maiden Test century (and what would have been the first-ever Test century by an Australian wicketkeeper) after the hosts batted first and reached 9/493, the captain making 56 himself. Australia continued to play defensively, and after making 42 in the second innings, the skipper declared and set the tourists 271 in less than a day, and the match petered out to a draw with Australia still behind in the series. Another draw in the Sixth Test meant that Australia needed a win to draw the series and retain the Ashes. After taking a 235-run first-innings lead, England did not need to take a risk with their series lead with a bold declaration and set Australia a world-record 469 runs for victory. The hosts were 3/328 when time ran out, and Lawry made only 10 and 21. Lawry had batted for more than 24 hours in the series, averaging around 13 runs an hour.

With Lawry&#x27;s defensive leadership under heavy fire, he was dropped along with three other players, becoming the first Australian captain to be sacked in the middle of a series. He was not informed privately by the Board and only found out after his axing was made public. The Australian selectors Don Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey had delayed the announcement while they tried to locate Lawry at the end of the Sixth Test, but he had already left for his home in Melbourne and they were unable to find him. He first heard the news on the radio and the selectors were much maligned in the press as a result. Lawry never played for Australia again, despite being only 33 years old and averaging 47.15, but immediately began his almost 50-year career as a commentator in the Seventh Test, saying, &quot;Well, I suppose we all have to get around to it some day&quot;. Two days earlier, after lengthy discussion, the ACB had voted 7–6 to acknowledge and respond to Lawry&#x27;s letter following the South African tour, although their reply did not directly address Lawry&#x27;s concerns. His successor, Ian Chappell, condemned the Board&#x27;s actions as &quot;unbelievable&quot;. Immediately after his appointment, the Chappell told his then-wife, &quot;The bastards won&#x27;t get me the way they got Bill,&quot; and he later went out on his own terms. Victorian and Australian teammate Paul Sheahan said of Lawry, &quot;The fact that no-one had the courage to tell him he was to lose his job as Australian captain was disgraceful.&quot; At the same time, Sheahan said that Lawry was &quot;a bit of an autocrat&quot; and &quot;not the sort of captain who stood alongside you and drew the best out of you.&quot;

Lawry was publicly dignified, later reflecting:

Australia went on to lose the final Test and the series 2–0. Lawry played out the remaining two matches of the season for Victoria, scoring two fifties.

The following season, Lawry continued playing for Victoria, leaving himself available for an international recall. He scored 116 not out against Western Australia and added four further fifties, three against South Australia. He added his only limited-overs century during the summer, scoring 108 not out in a win over South Australia. He totalled 488 runs at 44.36 for the first-class season, but was not recalled to the Test team during the summer. Neither was Lawry recalled for the 1972 tour of England, and in his absence Australia was unable to find a reliable opening partnership. Australia&#x27;s opening stand exceeded 24 only once in the Test series. He retired at the end of the 1971–72 season, bowing out of the sport with a three-wicket win over South Australia.

==Playing style==

&quot;When Australia batted, Lawry, their stumbling-block-extraordinary, took root, and in an interminable left-handed stand with Cowper effectively droused English prospects. When this relentless fellow, having reached his sixth Test hundred against England, at length took a liberty he had made 592 runs in the Tests, average 84, the highest aggregate since Bradman&#x27;s in 1946–47: not only that, he had scored 979 against M. J. K. Smith&#x27;s side since they landed in Perth, and had occupied the crease for forty-one and a half hours. There was a gayer side to Lawry as we had seen at Adelaide—but he didn&#x27;t let it obtrude too often. He just kept that long, sharp nose religiously over the ball, accumulating at his own deliberate gait, and in particular tucking everything away off his pads whenever the English bowlers bowled there, as all too often they did.&quot;
:E. W. Swanton
Along with Bob Simpson, he formed an opening partnership that was regarded as one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that &#x27;He always had to be got out and even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room&#x27;. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.

==Commentary career and later work==
After retiring from playing, Lawry worked as a commentator on radio and television, firstly with Channel 7 and then Channel 0 Melbourne, before joining Channel 9 television, beginning in the days of World Series Cricket in the 1977-78 season. His distinctive, enthusiastic and excitable style has often been parodied, especially in The Twelfth Man series; in addition to his persistent use of cliches, the Victorian was known for his signature catchcries, particularly &quot;Got him! Yes! He&#x27;s gone!&quot; when a wicket fell, &quot;It&#x27;s all happening!&quot; in reference to a see-sawing or chaotic passage of play, and &quot;Bang!&quot; (when a batsman attempted a big hit) and for his love of racing pigeons. Lawry&#x27;s long-running, argumentative but humorous commentary partnership with the South African-born former English captain Tony Greig was a mainstay of the Nine Network&#x27;s commentary offering for 33 years, ending with Greig&#x27;s death in December 2012.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lawry was the cricket manager of the Victorian Cricket Association, helping to recruit players for the Victorian team.

From 2013, Lawry scaled back his ball-by-ball commentary to international matches played in Melbourne such as the Boxing Day Test, and in Sydney for the New Year Test. In May 2018, he confirmed his retirement from broadcasting and commentary.

==Legacy==
In Australia a bottle opener is sometimes called a &quot;Bill Lawry&quot;, on account of him being a famous opener. Also a breed of pigeon (racing) is commonly known as the Lawry bird after his love of pigeon racing.

The Westgarth Street Oval in Northcote was renamed the Bill Lawry Oval. In 2010, Lawry was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.

<text>Jinju (; ) is a city in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It was the location of the first (1592) and second (1593) Sieges of Jinju by Japanese forces during the Imjin War. The Republic of Korea Air Force Education and Training Command is located in the eastern part of the city.
There are cultural-historical tourist attractions in Jinju such as Jinju Fortress, the Jinju National Museum, and the Nam-gang Prehistoric Site Museum.

==History==
Jinju was an ancient city of Goryeonggaya in the Gaya Era. This city was called &#x27;Geoyeolseong&#x27; of Baekje during the Three Kingdom Era, and was called &#x27;Geoyeolju&#x27;, &#x27;Cheongju&#x27;, and &#x27;Gangju&#x27; during the Unified Silla Era. Name of this city was changed into &#x27;Jinju&#x27; for the first time in 940, the 23rd year of King Taejo of the Goryeo Dynasty. It became &#x27;Jinju-mok&#x27;, one of 12 moks (local administrative units in Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty) in the 2nd year of King Seongjong (983).

The second siege of Jinju during the Japanese invasion of Korea ended in the massacre of the entire garrison and a substantial portion of the population. Korean accounts mention that the death toll at Jinju was 60,000. According to Japanese accounts, they had sent 20,000 heads back to Japan after their victory.

In the 33rd year of King Gojong of the Joseon Dynasty (1896), administrative district of the nation was reorganized with 13 provinces. At that time Jinju began to belong to Gyeongsangnam-do, and became capital town of Gyeongsangnam-do. And provincial governor started to reside in Jinju. On April 1, 1925, Busan replaced Jinju as provincial capital.

On August 15, 1948, the government of the Republic of Korea was established and &#x27;the local self-government system&#x27; was started. At that time, Jinju-bu was raised to Jinju-si (city) and started to have mayor of the city. On January 1, 1995, in accordance with &#x27;the Law pertaining to the establishment of Urban-Rural Integrated City&#x27;, Jinju-si and Jinyang-gun became extinct and were merged into one integrated Jinju-si (city).

==Culture and festivals==
There are cultural events held in Jinju every year. Among these are the Jinju Namgang Lantern Festival which is held in October for approximately ten days. This nationally designated cultural tourism festival, found only in Jinju, features a spectacle of lanterns floating on the Nam River to commemorate the patriotic spirit of the 70,000 militia corps and government troops who died for their country defending Jinju from the Japanese forces during the Imjin War (1592–1598). Other major festivals include: the Nongae Festival, the Korea Drama Festival, the Gaecheon Arts Festival and the Jinju National Bullfighting Contest.

The Nongae Festival, held in May each year commemorates and celebrates the sacrifice of the patriotic gisaeng (professional Korean entertainer) Nongae&#x27;s suicide-assassination of a Japanese general together with the 70,000 Koreans who lost their lives in the battle of Jinju Castle during the Imjin War. The festival features an emotional reenactment of Nongae&#x27;s suicidal drowning of a Japanese general from &quot;uiam bawi&quot; (righteous rock) below Chokseongnu (Jinju castle pavilion) on the banks of the Nam River.

Gaecheon Arts Festival is annually held from October 3 to 10 and the entire city turns to the streets for celebration at Korea&#x27;s first provincial culture art festival, which awakens the artistic spirit of the Korean people. The festival falls around Gaecheonjeol (National Foundation Day) and is widely regarded as one of Korea&#x27;s finest.

The Jinju National Bullfighting Contest is recognized as Korea&#x27;s oldest bullfighting event and spectators can witness a test of strength at this bullfighting contest held at a purpose-built traditional Korean sports arena near Jinyang lake.

The 2023 Asian Weightlifting Championships was held in Jinju.

==Population==
At just over a third of a million, Jinju is a relatively small city by Korean standards. The annual growth of the population is 0.4% since 1995. People between the ages of 20 and 29 represent 17.5% of the city&#x27;s total population, and justify the city&#x27;s long-standing reputation as an educational city. The senior population (65 years or older), representing 7.6% of the city&#x27;s total population, is higher than the provincial average (6.8%).

==Local personality==
Gang Se-hwang (son of Kang Hyeon), a high ranking government official and representative painter, calligrapher and art critic, was born here in 1713.

==Jinju cuisine==

Jinju has a number of distinctive local delicacies which reflect the tastes of Jinju people. Perhaps most celebrated is Jinju bibimbap, which distinguishes itself from the common Korean rice and vegetable dish by its use of &quot;yukhoe&quot;, made with raw beef and generous amounts of sesame oil. Also famous is Namgang (Nam River) grilled eel (), which is caught locally and served in any one of the numerous restaurants overlooking the Nam River. Enjoying their food spicy, Jinjuites have also perfected a spicey pepper (&quot;ttaengcho&quot;) version of the popular Korean side dish &quot;pajeon&quot; (scallion pancake) known by its colloquial name jijimi. This is best enjoyed with a bowl of local rice wine makkeolli.

Cheonhwang Sikdang, founded here in 1927, is among the oldest active restaurants in South Korea.

==Silk industry==
Since ancient days, silk processed in Jinju has been known for its superior quality, which is a result of the combination of natural resources (such as clean water of Mt. Jirisan and so on) and human resources. Silk factories in Jinju annually produce around 70% of the nation&#x27;s production. Jinju silk has a soft, refined feeling and elegant colors because of superior dyeing techniques.

==Education==
Jinju is an educational city and home to Gyeongsang National University and Chinju National University of Education, Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology. It is also home to International University of Korea, catering mostly to foreign students. It also has a number of community colleges that serve the local area. Jinju&#x27;s high schools offer high quality education and have a wide catchment area, reaching beyond the city limits to attract students from surrounding towns such as Sacheon, Hadong, and Sancheong.

Universities 
==Economy and business==

There are 618 manufacturing companies (11,806 employees), 1 local industrial complex and 4 rural industrial complexes as part of an integrated urban and rural city. Jinju Hyeoksin Dosi (New Innovation City) established by President Roh Moo-hyun with headquarters of vast LH Corporation (State-run Land &amp; Housing corp Toji Jutaek gongsa) and Namdong Thermal Power. Namdong Thermal Power is one of 5 thermal power subsidiaries: Nambu

<doc id="968856" wikidata="Q17497" url="?curid=968856" title="FC Dynamo Moscow">
<text>FC Dynamo Moscow (&quot;FC Dynamo Moskva&quot;, , ) is a Russian professional football club based in Moscow. Dynamo returned to the Russian Premier League for the 2017–18 season after one season in the second-tier Russian Football National League.

Dynamo was the only club that had always played in the top tier of Soviet football (along with Dynamo Kyiv) and of Russian football from the end of the Soviet era until they were relegated in 2016. Despite this, they have never won the modern Russian Premier League title and have won Russian Cup only once, in the season of 1994–95.

During the Soviet era, they were affiliated with the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs – The Soviet Militia) and with the KGB and was a part of Dynamo sports society. Chief of the Soviet security and secret police apparatus NKVD Lavrentiy Beria was a patron of the club until his downfall. For this reason, the team and fans was nicknamed &quot;the cops&quot; (менты).

From 10 April 2009 the VTB Bank has been the owner of Dynamo after acquiring a 74% share in the club. Boris Rotenberg Sr. was chairman until he resigned on 17 July 2015. On 29 December 2016, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to buy VTB Bank shares back for 1 ruble. On 14 February 2019, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to sell the club back to VTB for 1 ruble. On 24 February 2022, the shares were transferred by VTB back to the Dynamo sports society.

Dynamo&#x27;s traditional colours are blue and white. Their crest consists of a blue letter &quot;D,&quot; written in a traditional cursive style on a white background. The club&#x27;s motto is &quot;Power in Motion,&quot; initially proposed by Maxim Gorky, the famous Russian author, who was once an active member of the Dynamo sports society.

== History ==
===Foundation and Soviet era===
Dynamo Moscow has its roots in the football Club Sokolniki Moscow.

After the Russian Revolution, the club eventually found itself under the authority of the Interior Ministry and its head Felix Dzerzhinsky, chief of the Cheka, the Soviet Union&#x27;s secret police. The club was renamed Dynamo Moscow in 1923 but was also referred to disparagingly as &quot;garbage&quot;, a Russian criminal slang term for &quot;police&quot;, by some of the supporters of other clubs.

Dynamo won the first two Soviet Championships in 1936 and 1937, a Soviet Cup in 1937, and another pair of national titles in 1940 and 1945. In 1945, they were also the first Soviet club to tour the West when they played a series of friendlies in the United Kingdom. Complete unknowns to the British, the Soviet players first drew 3–3 against Chelsea and then defeated Cardiff City 10–1. They defeated an Arsenal side reinforced with Stanley Matthews, Stan Mortensen and Joe Bacuzzi by a score of 4–3 in a match played in thick fog at White Hart Lane. They then drew 2–2 against Scottish side Rangers, meaning they completed the tour undefeated.

They continued to be a strong side at home after World War II, and enjoyed their greatest success through the 1950s. Dynamo captured another five championships between 1949 and 1959, as well as their second Soviet Cup in 1953. Honours were harder to come by after that time. The club continued to enjoy some success in the Soviet Cup, but has not won a national championship since 1976. Even so, Dynamo&#x27;s 11 national titles make them the country&#x27;s third-most decorated side behind Dynamo Kyiv (13 titles) and Spartak Moscow (12 titles).

In the 1971–72 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Dynamo reached the Final at Camp Nou in Barcelona, losing 3–2 to Rangers. This was the first time a Russian side had reached a final in a European competition, a feat not repeated until CSKA Moscow won the UEFA Cup in 2005.

=== VTB Bank era (2009–2016) ===

At the end of the 2008 season, Dynamo finished third, qualifying for the 2009–10 Champions League preliminary round. On 29 July 2009, Dynamo recorded a 0–1 away win against Celtic at Celtic Park, which gave them a strong advantage going into the second leg. However, Celtic comfortably defeated Dynamo 0–2 in Moscow to progress, sending Dynamo into the Europa League play-off round where the club was eliminated by Bulgarian side CSKA Sofia after a 0–0 away draw in Sofia and a 1–2 home defeat in Moscow.

In 2012, after a poor start to the season in which they lost their first five league games, Dynamo replaced interim manager Dmitri Khokhlov with the Romanian Dan Petrescu, who managed to pull the club out of the relegation zone into a position in the upper-half of the league table. The team was close to qualifying for a place in European competition, but a failure to win in the last matchday left them in seventh, two points below the last Europa League qualifier position. Despite his efforts, Petrescu&#x27;s contract was terminated on 8 April 2014 by mutual agreement after a heavy loss to league outsiders Anzhi Makhachkala 0–4. As Dynamo Director of Sports Guram Adzhoyev stated, &quot;Last year Dan drew the team from the complicated situation, lifted it to the certain level, but recently we have seen no progress.&quot; Petrescu was replaced by Stanislav Cherchesov as manager. Under his management, Dynamo qualified for the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League in which they won every game before falling to Napoli in the Round of 16. Dynamo was only able to finish in fourth place in the 2014–15 season after a string of poor results in the latter stages.

In June 2015, Dynamo was excluded from 2015–16 Europa League competition for violating Financial Fair Play break-even requirements. As a result, VTB Bank proposed to transfer 74 percent of the shares of the club to the Dynamo sports society. Under the proposed plan, the society would own 100 percent of shares of Dynamo as it did in 2009, while the shares of the VTB Arena would still be held by the Bank. The move would allow the club to comply with the requirements of Financial Fair Play, and VTB Bank would continue to provide support to Dynamo to the extent consistent with Financial Fair Play regulations.

Manager Stanislav Cherchesov was replaced by the returning Andrey Kobelev, and many foreign players, such as Mathieu Valbuena, Balázs Dzsudzsák and Kevin Kurányi, subsequently left Dynamo. Several young Dynamo prospects, such as Grigori Morozov, Aleksandr Tashayev and Anatoli Katrich, who won the Under-21 competition in the 2014–15 season, were introduced to the first-team squad.

On 22 December 2015, Chairman of Dynamo&#x27;s board of directors Vasili Titov announced that the shares had not been transferred to the Dynamo society; that FFP compliance rather than the share transfer was the top priority for the club; and that he expected the club to achieve compliance by April 2016.

After the winter break of the 2015–16 season, Dynamo won only one game out of 12 played in 2016 and Kobelev was fired with 3 games left in the season. On the final day of the season, Dynamo lost 0–3 to FC Zenit Saint Petersburg at home, dropped to 15th place in the table and was relegated from the Premier League.

In October 2016, with Dynamo leading the second-tier Russian Football National League at the time, the newly appointed club president Yevgeni Muravyov claimed that club&#x27;s debts stand at 13 billion rubles (approximately 188 million euros) and unless a new owner is found shortly or VTB re-commits to covering the club&#x27;s debts, the club might declare bankruptcy. That would have most likely meant the loss of professional license and relegation to the fourth-level Russian Amateur Football League.

=== Dynamo Society era (2016 to 2019) ===
On 29 December 2016, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to buy VTB Bank shares back for 1 ruble. On 13 January 2017, VTB Bank announced they will sponsor Dynamo Sports Society to the amount of 10.64 billion rubles for the period from 2017 to 2019 (approximately 167 million euros as of that date). HC Dynamo Moscow and other teams of the society were also to be financed under that deal. On 1 February 2017, former club president Boris Rotenberg said that the 75 million euro debt the football club owes to Rotenberg&#x27;s companies has been restructured and &quot;is not harming anybody&quot;. On 12 April 2017, with 7 games left to play in the 2016–17 season, Dynamo secured the return to the top level Russian Premier League for 2017–18. That is the FNL record for the earliest a team secured promotion.

On 14 March 2018, Yevgeni Muravyov was dismissed as the club president due to unauthorized payment made as a &quot;bonus&quot; to a third company during the transfer of Konstantin Rausch from 1. FC Köln.

=== Return to VTB (2019 to 2022) ===
The new stadium for the club, VTB Arena was completed in late 2018. Following that, the stadium majority owner and football club&#x27;s major sponsor VTB Bank expressed interest in reacquiring the control over the club. On 14 February 2019, Dynamo Sports Society agreed to sell back the club shares to &quot;Dynamo Management Company&quot; (the company that owns the stadium and has VTB bank as the majority owner). The price was the same symbolic 1 ruble. On 26 April 2019, it was reported that the deal is close to be finalized formally, but the price for the stock increased to 10 billion rubles (approximately €138 million). This reported larger number includes accumulated debts and the cost of the club&#x27;s training centre. (At the beginning of 2021, the club&#x27;s chairman Yuri Solovyov said in an interview that Dynamo&#x27;s debts were about 5.4 billion rubles. The then state of the club Soloviev called &quot;shocking&quot;.) On 30 April 2019, VTB confirmed that the deal has been closed and formal price is 1 ruble, the debts outstanding from the football club to Dynamo society has been restructured to an 8-year term, and Yuri Belkin was appointed club&#x27;s general director.

The 2019–20 season, their first back at the home stadium, started poorly and head coach Dmitri Khokhlov resigned after 12 games played with Dynamo in second-to-last position in the table. Under his replacement, Kirill Novikov, results improved and at the end of the season Dynamo finished 6th. That allowed Dynamo to qualify for European competition (UEFA Europa League) for the first time in 6 seasons.

However, at the end of September 2020, Novikov was dismissed after losing to Locomotive Tbilisi (UEFA qualification) and Khimki (RPL). Sandro Schwarz was appointed as the new coach on 14 October.

In the spring of 2021, the sports press started talking about the &quot;revival&quot; of the Moscow Dynamo. Since the appointment of Sandro Schwarz as coach, the team have won seven victories and four defeats in the Russian Premier League matches. The club&#x27;s sporting director, Željko Buvač, has already described the start of the season as &quot;great.&quot; The team finished the season in 7th place.

=== Return to Dynamo Society (from 2022) ===
On 24 February 2022, as a consequence of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, VTB Bank was sanctioned by the United Kingdom. On the same day, VTB Bank transferred the shares of FC Dynamo back to the Dynamo Sports Society.

After the invasion was launched, former Liverpool F.C. and Ukraine striker Andriy Voronin, who had been the team&#x27;s assistant coach, left the club, writing that he could not work in a country that was bombing his homeland.

The club remained in second place in the 2021–22 Russian Premier League and at competitive points distance from first-place defending champions FC Zenit Saint Petersburg for most of the season before some late Dynamo losses allowed Zenit to secure the title with three games left to play in the season. The club also qualified for the 2021–22 Russian Cup final, their first Russian Cup final appearance since 2012. On the last matchday of the league season on 21 May 2022, Dynamo lost 1–5 at home to PFC Sochi and dropped to 3rd place, letting Sochi overtake them. Still, that was the first Top-3 finish for Dynamo since 2008. On 29 May 2022, Dynamo lost the Russian Cup final to Spartak 1–2, with Daniil Fomin missing a penalty kick deep in added time. Manager Sandro Schwarz resigned from the club after the Cup final.

Slaviša Jokanović was hired as a new manager on 17 June 2022. Several key starting line-up foreign players from the 2021–22 season left the club on loan or suspended their contracts before the season due to the continuing Russian war in Ukraine, including Sebastian Szymański, Nikola Moro, Fabián Balbuena, Ivan Ordets, and Guillermo Varela. Dynamo took positions in the upper half of the league table, but below the top 3 during the summer/fall part of the 2022–23 season, not going on any long unbeaten or winless streaks. New Cameroonian signing Moumi Ngamaleu was the only Dynamo player selected for the 2022 FIFA World Cup squads (not counting Szymański and Varela who were loaned out before the season). Dynamo went into the winter break of the season in 4th place. The results continued to be inconsistent after the winter break, and Jokanović was dismissed on 14 May 2023 following a 0–3 home loss to FC Akhmat Grozny, with Dynamo in 7th place. Dynamo lost 5 of the last 7 league games and finished in 9th place.

On 22 June 2023, Marcel Lička was appointed new manager. After losing the opening game of the 2023–24 season, Dynamo went into the winter break in 3rd place. After a series of three losses in late March and early April, Dynamo dropped 9 points behind league leaders Zenit and 5 points behind second-placed Krasnodar with 7 games left. However, Dynamo won their next five games, including scoring winning goals late in added time against Sochi and Baltika, as Zenit and Krasnodar both went on winless streaks, and with 2 games left Dynamo took the top spot in the table with a 2 points lead. Dynamo extended the winning streak to 6 in the next game, a win or a draw in the last game of the season on 25 May 2024 away against Krasnodar would have secured the title for Dynamo. Dynamo lost 0–1 to Krasnodar, allowing Krasnodar to overtake them in the standings, as Zenit won their game and claimed their sixth consecutive title, with Dynamo finishing in 3rd place. At the season-end league awards, Konstantin Tyukavin was named player of the season and forward of the season and received the goal of the season award, as Lička was named coach of the season.

Four Dynamo players have been selected for the 2024 Copa América squads (Luis Chávez for Mexico, Nicolás Marichal for Uruguay, Jorge Carrascal for Colombia and Fabián Balbuena for Paraguay).

In the 2024–25 Russian Premier League season, Dynamo gained 30 points after the first half of the games have been played, that was a 5-point improvement on the previous season&#x27;s record at the same point. Dynamo also never gained more points after 15 games since RPL was created in 1992, and the last time they reached 30 was in 1997. However, they were in 4th place at that point, 7 points behind league-leading Krasnodar. On 2 December 2024, Dynamo goalkeeper Igor Leshchuk scored an added-time equalizer with a header against Akhmat Grozny, becoming the first goalkeeper in the history of the Russian Premier League (and Soviet Top League before it) to score a goal which was not a converted penalty kick. Dynamo went into the season&#x27;s winter break in 4th place with 35 points, 4 points behind league leaders Krasnodar and Zenit.

== FC Dynamo Moscow Women&#x27;s team ==

In December 2021, according to the strategy of the club, FC Dynamo Football launched Women&#x27;s team, as well as Women&#x27;s Youth team and Girl&#x27;s section in Lev Yashin Academy. Sergey Lavrentiev, graduate of the club UEFA &quot;A&quot; licence holder and former &quot;man at the wheel&quot; of Russian National Women&#x27;s team, Chertanovo and CSKA Moscow women&#x27;s teams, was appointed head coach of the new-born first squad. Goalkeepers coach Vitaly Shadrin (alongside same duties at Russian National Women&#x27;s team) and strength &amp; conditioning coach Yulia Gordeeva have also joined the staff.

== Lev Yashin Academy ==

In 2021 the academy won both winter and summer championships in Moscow youth league, Club&#x27;s League, being the only club to score more than 200 goals (2,85 per match) and conceding as well the fewest number of 47 goals. Soon after, Alexander Kuznetsov, academy&#x27;s director since 2013 and since 2006 in the club, has overviewed the evolution of football education in the academy, precising that &quot;we&#x27;ve stopped acquiring &quot;running horses&quot; in favour of footballers – creative, technically skilled and able to make right decisions on the pitch&quot;. Mr Kuznetsov has also mentioned the role in modern approach in the Academy of Juan Martinez Garcia, Spanish specialist, who had been working in the club for several years a decade ago. In March 2022, the academy and Higher School of Economics became official partners in education and research.

; Franchise
The club has a football Academy named after Lev Yashin (official site ), created on the basis of the Dynamo youth team. In recent years, the owners of the club have seriously taken up its development. VTB Group has created an endowment fund with a capital of 5 billion rubles to finance the training of young footballers. The board of trustees of the fund is headed by the former prime minister of Russia, member of the board of directors of Dynamo, Sergei Stepashin.
In 2020, 13 graduates of the academy played for the main team of Dynamo.

In 2020, the academy began to develop a network of branches. The first branch was created in Makhachkala (Dagestan) and then in more than 15 Russian cities and towns. In August and September 2021, the latest franchise football schools of the academy were opened in Barnaul, in Belgorod, in Vladivostok, in Voronezh and in stanitsa Novotitarovskaya in Krasnodar Krai. The next branch, based on local &quot;Junior&quot; school of sports, would be coming soon in Nizhnevartovsk.

In August 2021, the club started providing online workshops as a manual to launch Lev Yashin Academy franchises in any Russian city.

; Endowment fund
In September 2021, Alexander Ovechkin, worldwide hockey superstar and former HC Dynamo Moscow forward, was named official ambassador for the endowment fund of Lev Yashin Academy.

The first ever vintage Dynamo&#x27;s collection was produced in 2008 and then in the late 2010s. A new vintage fashion line was launched in August 2021 featuring heritage brand &quot;Olovo&quot;.

In September 2021, iconic British designer Nigel Cabourn started cooperating with the club with a fashion line, which will be his first cooperation with a football club, in a view of FC Dynamo Moscow&#x27;s centenary in 2022, because vintage has always been a source of inspiration for the designer. In February 2022, Nigel Cabourn presented the whole FC Dynamo Moscow casual range at Pitti Uomo, famous international men&#x27;s fashion show, at Fortezza da Basso in Florence.

In October 2021, capsule collection, dedicated to Lev Yashin&#x27;s anniversary, was shown in his favourite cinema, Pioner, in Moscow.

==Rivalries==
Since its establishment in 1923, Dynamo&#x27;s historical rival has been Spartak Moscow. Clashes between the clubs were seen by their fans and more generally as the most important games in the Soviet Union for more than three decades, attracting thousands of spectators. (Ironically, however, on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1936, it was a combined Dynamo-Spartak team that traveled to Paris to face Racing Club de France, then one of Europe&#x27;s top teams.) Dynamo clinched the first-ever Soviet League by beating Spartak 1–0 at Dynamo Stadium. Spartak responded by winning the championship the following year.

== Stadium ==
Dynamo&#x27;s ground used to be the historic Dynamo Stadium in Petrovsky Park, which seated 36,540. In 2008, it was closed for demolition. From 2010 to 2016, Dynamo Moscow played their matches at the Arena Khimki, which they shared with their Moscow rivals, CSKA Moscow. They continued to play at Arena Khimki until 26 May 2019, when FC Dynamo Moscow officially &quot;returned home,&quot; 
as they played their first match at the newly opened VTB Arena.

=== Average attendance ===
In the 1st half of the 2021–22 season Dynamo recorded the best attendance at home among Moscow football clubs, according to official stats provided by Russian Premier League.

<text>The Oude Rijn (&quot;Old Rhine&quot;) is a branch of the Rhine delta in the Dutch provinces of Utrecht and South Holland, starting west of Utrecht, at Harmelen, and running by a mechanical pumping station into the North Sea at Katwijk. Its present-day length is 52 kilometres.

In ancient times, it was the lower part of the main River Rhine, which forked at the Betuwe into a northern branch, the Rhine, and a southern branch, the Waal. The Oude Rijn was then much wider than it is now, and tidal. During the Roman occupation, the river formed part of the northern border of the Empire. In medieval times, the River Lek became the main outlet for the Rhine, and the Oude Rijn silted up. The river was still important as a drain for the surrounding lowlands, for the clay industry, and as a transport and trade route. Ships were towed by horse and human power, using a towpath along large sections of the river, many parts of which have since been upgraded to roads or cycle paths.

==Description==
The city of Utrecht was founded at a ford near the fork of the Kromme Rijn into the Vecht to the north and the Oude Rijn to the west. Of the original fork, little remains today, and both Vecht and Rijn start from the city moat. For the first few kilometres of its course, the river is channelised and known as the Leidse Rijn (Leiden Rhine). It becomes the Oude Rijn after the railway bridge near Harmelen (municipality Woerden). Then it flows westward through Woerden where first the Lange Linschoten branches off to the south and then the Oude Rijn forms part of the city moats.

After Woerden, the River Grecht branches off to the north and the Oude Rijn continues through the towns of Nieuwerbrug, Bodegraven, and Zwammerdam. Here the stream empties into the Oude Rijn. In Alphen aan den Rijn, the Aar Canal joins the river and the Gouwe branches off to the south. It then flows through Koudekerk aan den Rijn and Hazerswoude-Rijndijk.

After Zoeterwoude-Rijndijk and Leiderdorp, where the short River Does ends, the Oude Rijn flows through Leiden. The Rhine-Schie Canal and the Zijl stream begin here. The Nieuwe Rijn (&quot;New Rhine&quot;) is a short branch that, together with the Oude Rijn, forms part of Leiden&#x27;s moat system; the two branches merge in the city&#x27;s centre.

The stream Korte Vliet discharges into the Oude Rijn and it continues through Valkenburg and Rijnsburg to Katwijk. At Katwijk aan den Rijn the Oegstgeesterkanaal merges with the Oude Rijn. From here the river has been straightened into a canal (called the &quot;Uitwateringkanaal&quot;); it empties into the North Sea through a pumping station, preventing high tides inland and silting up of the river mouth.

==Water management &amp; Waterworks==

Around 1000 CE the river silted up, causing floodings of the lowlands. As prevention, around 1100 CE a dam with locks was built at the village of Zwammerdam, upstream at the border to Utrecht, an area reigned by German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Continuing problems in water management in wide areas along Oude Rijn were reason for civilians with administrative responsibilities to collaborate and to establish a so-called High Water Authority or in Dutch Hoogheemraadschap, the first of its kind in The Netherlands. The organisation has been privileged in 1255 by Count William II of Holland and Zeeland as central coordinator of all waterworks in the area and later was given the name Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland. Early works were the building of draining canals around the city of Leiden. From 1408 on, with the first at Zoeterwoude, wind-powered pumps were installed along the Old Rhine, to pump water from the lowlands into the river.

The river silted up in the course of the Middle Ages and became much smaller. In 1572 near the North Sea the Water Authority had a canal built through the dunes to allow the Rhine water to flow into the sea, but due to war circumstances, it did silt. In 1807, a large water management system with locks was established to allow the water to flow out at low tide. In 1880 a steam driven mechanical pumping station was built.

==History==
===Roman era===
In Roman times, the river Oude Rijn formed part of the Roman Empire&#x27;s northern border (Limes Germanicus). At strategic locations the Romans did build guarding-towers and border-guarding castella and castra, including: &quot;Laurum&quot; (Woerden), &quot;Nigrum Pullum&quot; (Zwammerdam), &quot;Albaniana&quot; (Alphen aan den Rijn), &quot;Matilo&quot; (Leiderdorp), &quot;Praetorium Agrippinae&quot; (Valkenburg), and &quot;Lugdunum Batavorum&quot; (Katwijk). Many of the at that time unpopulated locations, evolved into cities and villages.

In Valkenburg, the layout of the Roman castellum has been marked in the pavement. At Woerden and Zwammerdam, Roman ships have been excavated.

<doc id="968860" wikidata="Q42096" url="?curid=968860" title="Miryang">
<text>Miryang () is a city in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Neighboring cities include Changnyeong to the west, Cheongdo to the north, Ulsan to the east, and Yangsan, Gimhae, and Changwon to the south. The city bird is the Korean magpie, the city tree is the pine, and the city flower is the royal azalea.

The recorded history of Miryang begins in the Samhan period, when it was known as Mirimidongguk. Due to its strategic location near the Nakdong River, Miryang played an important role from the Silla period forward. It served as an important station on the Great Yeongnam Road during the later Joseon Dynasty, and in the 20th century it became a station on the Gyeongbu Line railroad that connects Busan to Seoul. Miryang remains a key stop along that line, and is now the only city between Busan and Daegu served by KTX express trains.

Miryang is known around Korea for the Miryang &quot;arirang&quot; and for the view from the Yeongnamnu pavilion, subject of numerous poems from the Joseon period. Other noted landmarks include Eoreumgol and the temple of Pyochungsa. Famous people from Miryang include 15th-century Neo-Confucian scholar Kim Chong-jik and 16th-century warrior-monk Songun Yu Jeong. The city government works actively to maintain the memory of these figures, and of other local cultural features such as the tale of Arang.

== Toponymy ==
Its name is originated from the tribal country named Miri midong guk (彌離彌凍國). Its name was previously perhaps pronounced as Milbeol using Idu script formerly also spelled as 推火郡 (probably pronounced as Milbeol or Miribeol using Idu script), Milbeol (密伐) and Milseong (密城), There are various hypotheses as to the meaning of Miryang, such as Milky Way, Galaxy, dragon&#x27;s field, Wheat Field and the watery field.

==History==
During the Samhan, Miryang may have been part of the territory of Mirimidongguk, one of the Byeonhan tribes mentioned in the &quot;San guo zhi&quot;. Thereafter, it is believed to have been ruled by Geumgwan Gaya before being annexed by Silla. The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records Mirimidongguk as being annexed by Jijeung of Silla in 505. In this period it was known as Chuhwa-gun (). Under the general reformation of names carried out by King Gyeongdeok in the 8th century, the name was changed to &quot;Milseong-gun&quot; ().

In the Goryeo period (935–1392), Miryang was elevated to the status of a &quot;ju&quot;, Mil-ju, by King Seongjong. In 1194, Miryang was the site of a massive battle between royal forces and a massive rebel army led by Kim Sami of Cheongdo and Hyosim of Ulsan. More than 7,000 rebels were slain. Under King Chungnyeol in the late 13th century, local residents led by Jo Cheon rose up against the government; in retaliation, Mil-ju was demoted to a tributary village of Gyeongju (then Gyerim). Later it became a &quot;hyeon&quot;. Under King Gongyang, it was raised to the status of a &quot;bu&quot;.

With the dawn of the Joseon period (1392–1910), Miryang first became known by its modern name. Initially demoted from &quot;bu&quot; to &quot;gun&quot; (county) by King Taejo, it was then raised back to &quot;bu&quot; and its name changed from &quot;Milseong&quot; to &quot;Miryang.&quot; Under Taejo&#x27;s son King Taejong, it was once again demoted to &quot;gun&quot;. Later it became a &quot;dohobu&quot;, or military protectorate, and in 1895 it became a &quot;gun&quot; once again; it was to carry this status until late in the 20th century.

Under Japanese rule, Miryang was the site of various clashes between the Korean independence movement and the occupation forces. During the March First Movement of 1919, approximately 13,500 Miryang residents took part in peaceful demonstrations in support of Korean independence. This led to the &quot;Miryang massacre,&quot; in which 150 Korean civilians were shot by occupation troops. In November 1920, independence fighter Choe Su-bong built and detonated two bombs at the Miryang police station, destroying the structure. He attempted to kill himself but was unsuccessful; later he was put to death and his accomplices were imprisoned.

In 1989 the city center was separated from the rest of Miryang and named &quot;Miryang-si&quot; (Miryang City). In 1995 the city center was reunited with the hinterland and the entire region became known as Miryang-si. Both of these were part of general reorganizations of South Korean local government.

Miryang gained national attention as the location of a gang rape incident in 2004.

==Geography and climate==

Miryang&#x27;s geography is heavily influenced by the two rivers which flow through it, the Miryang and Nakdong Rivers. All of Miryang lies within the Nakdong basin, and the Nakdong River itself runs along Miryang&#x27;s southern border. The city&#x27;s topography generally slopes from the high peaks of the Yeongnam Alps in the northeast to the Nakdong valley in the southwest. Much of the city is drained by the Miryang River, which rises in western Ulsan and flows through the city center to join the Nakdong at Samnangjin. Portions are drained by other Nakdong tributaries, including the Naejincheon.

The Miryang River valley south of the city center broadens into a fertile plain. This area, including large portions of Samnangjin-eup, Sangnam-myeon, and Hanam-eup, serves as a local breadbasket and is almost entirely devoted to rice-farming. In Hanam-eup, it joins another plain running along the Nakdong.

As elsewhere in the Yeongnam region, the landscape is very lumpy, with many craggy hills and low mountains. The highest mountain in Miryang is Gajisan (), which stands on the northern border. Other high peaks along the border include Hwaaksan and Cheonhwangsan (also called Jaeyaksan). These peaks are part of the Yeongnam Alps, a branch of the Taebaek Mountains.

Further south, the mountains are lower but still quite frequent. Notable peaks in this area include Maneosan in Samnangjin and Cheontaesan on the border with Yangsan. Steep mountain valleys abound; these are often used for reservoirs that store water for irrigation or drinking purposes. Some of the larger reservoirs in Miryang include Miryang Lake and Antae Lake.

===Climate===
Like most of the rest of South Korea, Miryang enjoys a relatively mild temperate climate. The average windspeed is about , the average temperature , and the annual rainfall in 2004 was .

The mountains along its north flank afford Miryang a measure of shelter from heavy winds and other severe weather coming from the north. On the other hand, it is relatively vulnerable to damage from tropical storms encroaching from the south.

The Miryang and Nakdong valleys are subject to frequent floods during typhoons, as well as more predictable flooding during the monsoon season. Other natural disasters are uncommon.

==Administrative divisions==
Miryang is divided into 16 primary divisions, of which 2 are &quot;eup&quot; (large villages [towns]), 5 are &quot;dong&quot; (city precincts [neighborhoods]), and 9 are &quot;myeon&quot; (rural areas [townships or sub-counties]). Some of the &quot;dong&quot; are further subdivided, so that the city center is composed of eight legal &quot;dong&quot; in total. The &quot;eup&quot; and &quot;myeon&quot; are broken into &quot;ri&quot;, of which Miryang has a total of 265 administrative or 119 legal.

==Government and politics==

Like other cities and counties in South Korea, Miryang enjoys a limited degree of local autonomy. Since 1995, the mayor and city council have been elected directly by the local citizens.

The current mayor is , a member of the United Future Party. He took office on June 30, 2014.

==Economy==
The economy of Miryang draws heavily on its central location and prominence as a tourist destination. In addition, agriculture continues to play an important role, particularly in outlying districts. The Miryang River valley supports extensive rice farming operations, while livestock farming is more common on higher ground.

==Transportation==

Miryang is roughly equidistant from Daegu and Busan, and is connected to both cities by road and rail. By road, Miryang is served by two exits on the Daegu-Busan Expressway, as well as numerous national and local highways. By rail, it is served both by the Gyeongbu Line (Seoul-Busan) and the Gyeongjeon Line (to Masan); the northern terminus of the Gyeongjeon Line lies just north of Samnangjin near the meeting of the Nakdong and Miryang Rivers. Miryang is the only city between Daegu and Busan currently served by the KTX express train.

In addition to Miryang station in the city center, outlying regions are served by Samnangjin station and Sangdong station on the Gyeongbu Line, and Nakdonggang station on the Gyeongjeon Line. These outlying stations are served only by a small number of Mugunghwa-ho passenger trains.

Except for Nakdonggang station, the stations in Miryang also serve freight trains. The most active freight station is Sangdong, which sent out 74,762 tons of freight in 2004.

==Culture==
Miryang is known as the home of the Miryang arirang. This is sometimes considered to be close to the original version of the arirang, which may have drawn its name from the Miryang area folktale of Arang. The Miryang Arirang Festival is held each May to commemorate and keep alive this tradition and other aspects of local heritage.

Other preserved aspects of Korean traditional culture are the Baekjung performances.

The people of Miryang speak a version of the Gyeongsang dialect of Korean. In studies of Korean dialectology, Miryang dialect has been contrasted with the Changwon dialect in terms of the use of pitch.

Miryang is notable for being filming location and the setting of the 2007 film &quot;Miryang&quot; (released in English-language markets under the title &quot;Secret Sunshine&quot;).

==Education==
The history of education in Miryang can be traced back to the Goryeo period, when a &quot;hyanggyo&quot;, a government-run village school, was constructed in the town center (modern-day Gyo-dong). This school, famed for its size, continued in operation through the Joseon period, although it was gradually supplanted by numerous local seodang and seowon. All of these institutions concentrated on training young men for the royal civil service examinations. This system lasted until the abolition of the examinations in the Gabo Reforms of 1894.

Today in Miryang, as elsewhere in South Korea, compulsory public education is provided for all students through middle school, and almost all students complete high school as well. Education within the city is overseen by the Miryang Office of Education, which is administered directly by the Gyeongsangnam-do provincial Office of Education. This is in turn accountable to the national Ministry of Education, which sets the national curriculum for all schools.

There are 23 elementary schools, 14 middle schools, and 8 high schools in Miryang. Supplementary private education is offered through hagwons, which are strongly concentrated in the city center, with some in outlying towns.
There is only one institution of higher education in Miryang. This is the Miryang campus of Pusan National University. The Miryang campus primarily serves science and technology students, hosting the College of Nano Science and Technology and the College of Biological Sciences. It is located in northern Samnangjin-eup, roughly 9 km from the Miryang city center. A branch campus, formerly the main campus, is located near downtown Miryang. These two campuses were merged into Pusan National University in 2006. Previously, they made up a separate university called , which traced its roots back to 1923.

==Tourism==

Miryang has been known for centuries for its scenery of mountains and valleys; the Yeongnamnu pavilion overlooking the Miryang River appears in numerous Joseon Dynasty writings. The northeastern corner of the city occupies a portion of the Yeongnam Alps; part of this region is included in Gajisan Provincial Park. Noted natural landmarks include the &quot;ice valley&quot; of Eoreumgol, also located in the northeast.

A number of noted historic landmarks are found in Miryang. These include various seowon, or Confucian academies, including the Yerim Seowon dedicated to Kim Chong-jik and the Pyochung Seowon, which is the only seowon constructed inside a Buddhist temple (Pyochungsa). The Yeongnamnu pavilion and nearby buildings date from the Joseon and Goryeo periods. South Korean National Treasure No. 75 is located at Pyochungsa.

Yangyangji, which was built during the Silla period, was a water reservoir for the rice paddies, but it lost its original function due to a huge additional reservoir. But instead of putting water on the rice fields, the park attracts many tourists with picturesque scenery.

<doc id="968862" wikidata="Q8352359" url="?curid=968862" title="Bread knife">
<text>Bread knives are used for cutting bread and are one of many kitchen knives used by cooks. The serrated blades of bread knives are able to cut soft bread without crushing it.

==History==

One such knife was exhibited at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893 in Chicago by the Friedrich Dick company (Esslingen, Germany). One design was patented in the United States by Joseph E. Burns of Syracuse, New York, in 1919, predating the invention of automatically sliced bread by about ten years. His knife had sections of grooves or serrations, inclined with respect to the axis of the blade, that form individual small cutting edges which were perpendicular to the blade and thus cut without the excessive normal pressure required of a scalloped blade and without the horizontal force required by positive-raked teeth that would dig into the bread like a wood saw. There were also sections of grooves with the opposite direction of inclination, separated by a section of smooth blade, and the knife thus cut cleanly in both directions in both hard and soft bread.

==Measurement==
Bread knives are usually between . An offset serrated knife uses an offset handle to ensure the cook&#x27;s knuckles will not touch the cutting surface when the blade has cut all of the way through the food.

<text>Sacheon (; ) is a city in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. Sacheon&#x27;s chief fame comes from its being the site of two naval battles in the Seven Year War.

The city as it now exists results from the merging of Sacheon-gun and Samcheonpo-si in 1995. The northern part of the city is called Sacheon-eub and is located at the top of Sacheon Bay, near the city of Jinju. The southern part of the city is located in the old Samcheonpo-si, which is located at the mouth of Sacheon Bay.

==History==
During prehistoric times, the local area was very important for trade between the interior and coastal area. A large central settlement called the Igeum-dong site developed in the neighbourhood of the same name in Samcheonpo. This complex site was a major settlement, megalithic cemetery, and ceremonial area during the latter part of the Middle Mumun pottery period (c. 700-550 B.C.). Several islands that lie just off the coast of Samcheonpo, including Neuk-do Island and Ma-do Islet, were also important during the same period and into the Korean Protohistoric period when this part of Korea increased its trade contacts with the chiefdoms in the Liaoning Province region of China, Taedong-gang River area of North Korea, and Yayoi chiefdoms of Western Japan (c. 300 B.C.- A.D. 300/400).

==Economy==

Traditionally, the urbanized part of Sacheon (Sacheon-eub) and the coastal settlement of Samcheonpo have different economic functions. Samcheonpo has a good harbour and has been sustained by fishing and other marine industries for hundreds of years. This part of the city continues to be a regional hub for these industries:a major fish market and a number of live fish distribution centres are located at the harbour area. Sacheon-eub is in close proximity to the Namhae Expressway and the city of Jinju, thus contains manufacturing, transport and service industry facilities.

Korean Aerospace Industries, a national aerospace company, and Korea AeroSpace Administration is based in Sacheon. British American Tobacco Korea has a major manufacturing complex in Sacheon, too. The National Aerospace Industrial Complex, measuring , has been under construction since April 2019. This complex, which focuses on the aerospace industry, is expected to house related companies.

Much of the area between Sacheon-eub and Samcheonpo is a narrow coastal plain, and devoted to fruit producing orchards as well as wet and dry agriculture.

==Transportation==
Sacheon Airport is located in the industrial part of Sacheon-eup, and there are two daily flights to Seoul&#x27;s Gimpo airport. The Korean National Railroad passenger terminal is located in nearby Jinju. Sacheon-eup and Samcheonpo both have bus terminals that serve local and regional destinations such as Jinju, Masan, and Busan.

==Attractions==
The harbour area of Samcheonpo contains a multitude of rustic but popular raw fish restaurants close to the waterfront. The fish and traditional market areas are nearby.

The harbour of Samcheonpo is the gateway to a number of small islands lying offshore, where people still practice a traditional fishing subsistence lifestyle that dates back to the Jeulmun Period (c. 4000 BC).

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Sacheon is twinned with:

* Uiryeong County, South Gyeongsang Province
* Jeongeup, North Jeolla Province 
* Miyoshi, Hiroshima, Japan

==Trivia==
In Korean, the idiom &quot;&quot;, literally &quot;Was going well but suddenly slips into Samcheonpo,&quot; means that a speaker has gone off-topic.

Park Seonghwa, member of the K-pop group ATEEZ, was born in Sacheon, but was raised in Jinju.

<doc id="968869" wikidata="Q206403" url="?curid=968869" title="Sicambri">
<text>The Sicambri (also Sugambri) were a Germanic people who lived in the area between the Rhine, Lippe, and Wupper rivers, in what is now Germany, near the border with the Netherlands. They were first reported by Julius Caesar, who encountered them in 55 BC. They became a significant opponent of Roman imperial power in the Rhine region. After a major defeat by the Romans in 8 BC a significant part of the Sicambri were moved into Roman territory.

Caesar categorized them as a Germanic people (&quot;Germani&quot;), although he did not necessarily define ethnicity in terms of language. Whether or not the Sicambri spoke a Germanic or Celtic language, or something else, is not certain. They lived in a contact zone where these two language families came into contact and were both influential.

By the 3rd century, the region in which they and their neighbours had lived had become part of the territory of the Franks, which was a new name that possibly represented a new alliance of older tribes, possibly including the Sicambri. However, many Sicambri had been moved into the Roman empire by this time.

== Name and language ==
The specific way the name is spelt differs can differ considerably across sources. The &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography&quot; gives four variant spellings under the entry &quot;Sicambri&quot;: Sycambri, Sygambri, Sugambri, and Sucambri. The earliest source, Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, calls them &quot;Sugambri&quot; but in later sources they are more commonly called &quot;Sicambri&quot;. 

A Germanic etymology has been proposed for the name of the Sicambri or Sugambri. The first element su- is proposed to be a little-known Germanic version of Indo-European meaning &quot;good&quot;, which is better attested in Celtic languages. The second part of the name is associated with the little-known Gambrivii, who are mentioned twice by Roman sources, and sometimes associated with the Sicambri by modern scholars, because of the similar names.

The material culture of the early Sicambri which was a variant of the La Tène culture, which is associated with Celtic languages. Like the Cimbri, and like their neighbours across the Rhine, the Eburones, many names of Sicambrian leaders end in typical Celtic suffixes like -rix (Baetorix, Deudorix, etc.). If the Sicambri were not Celtic speakers themselves, this could also indicate intense contacts with Celtic peoples across the Rhine in Gaul.

== History ==
=== Gallic Wars of Caesar===
The first mention of the Sicambri is in the fourth book of Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, corresponding to year 55 BC. Under the name &quot;Sugambri&quot; he described them living on the eastern bank of the Rhine, north of the Ubii, stretching to a point near the Rhine delta begins, whwere said there were settlements of Menapii. Modern researchers locate their main centers of settlement between the rivers Sieg and Lippe with a concentration between the rivers Rhine, Lippe, and Wupper.

The tribe had an ancillary role in the Gallic Wars. Two other transrhenic tribes, the Tencteri and Usipetes, crossed into the Eburones&#x27; territory on the western side of the Rhine, where large numbers were slaughtered by Caesar. Their cavalry escaped across the Rhine and received refuge with the Sicambri, who refused Caesar&#x27;s demand that the refugees be handed over. As a show of Roman strength, Caesar built a pile bridge across the Rhine and advanced into Sicambri territory. The Sicambri did not wait for his arrival, but on the advice of their wards, withdrew into forests and uninhabited areas where Caesar was unable to follow them. However, their villages, farms, and grain fields were systematically destroyed. Caesar withdrew after 18 days across the Rhine and destroyed the bridge on his return.

In 53 BC, after Caesar defeated the Eburones, but failed to capture their leader Ambiorix, he reported that he invited neighbouring peoples to destroy the remainder. Some 2,000 Sicambrian horsemen responded to Caesar&#x27;s call and, crossing the Rhine in boats, advanced into the Eburones&#x27; territory. After gathering cattle, they were encouraged by captive Eburones to attack to the Roman garrison at Aduatuca, hearing that the Romans had stored a large amount of plunder there. In his report Caesar emphasized that the landscape was difficult for the Romans, but &quot;neither morass nor forest obstructs these men, born amid war and depredations&quot;. The Romans at Aduatuca were busy foraging, and thus caught off-guard by the attack, and repelled it only with substantial difficulty and losses. The Sicambrians were able to retire back across the Rhine with their plunder, and without any reprisal.

=== Germanic wars of Augustus===
Under the ensuing hegemony of the Romans in this region, the Rhine became a frontier, and the successors of Caesar helped fortify and reinforce their allies the Ubii, to the south of the Sicambri near modern Cologne. A faction of Chatti were also able to settle in Roman-controlled Batavia, in the Rhine delta just east of the Sugambri, becoming the Batavians. The Sicambri were thus enclosed within a pincer movement by Rome&#x27;s frontier policy.

In 16 BC, during the reign of Augustus (), the Sicambrian leader Melo, brother of Baetorix, organised a raid including Tencteri and Usipetes, which defeated a Roman army under the command of Marcus Lollius. The Sugambri had damaged the prestige of the emperor, and they were quickly willing to negotiate agreements to prevent Roman reprisals. It nevertheless sparked a reaction from the Roman Empire and helped start the series of Germanic Wars. Among actions undertaken at this time the Romans established a fort at present day Xanten. 

From 12 BC-8 BC, the Roman empire put pressure upon the Sicambri and other opponents in this region in multiple campaigns, facing the Sicambri core lands. In 12 BC the Sicambri made attacks across the Rhine. Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Elder) launched an attack from Batavia, moving first through the lands of the Usipetes, and then devasted the Sicambrian country. In 11 BC he then devastated the Usipetes&#x27; country, and built a bridge over the Lippe in order to once again enter the Sicambrian lands. There he faced little resistance because they were in a conflict with their neighbours the Chatti. He was able to cross this country and reach the Cherusci frontier near the Weser. Drusus faced stiff resistance upon his return, but he defeated the Sicambri and it was probably at this time that the Romans built their fort at Oberaden, well east of the Rhine in Sicambrian territory. These descriptions show that the tribe was living to the south of the river Lippe, with the Usipetes now settled to their northwest. 

In 9 BC the Sicambri battled Drusus as part of a major alliance with the Cherusci and Suevi and lost. In 8-7 BC, after this defeat and the death of Drusus, the future emperor Tiberius forced the Sicambri, or a part of them, to move to the western, Roman-controlled, side of the Rhine. Modern historians speculate that they possibly merged into Romanized population immediately facing their old lands, who were known from about this time as the Cugerni. The more detailed description of this period by Cassius Dio however describes the results of the victories of Tiberius somewhat differently:

It appears that Tiberius used a diplomatic approach where by the Sicambrian nobles were isolated as the Germanic region became more peace-seeking. More cooperative Germanic leaders took the upper hand. They accepted a Roman demand to move about 40,000 individuals people to the Xanten area west of the Rhine and elites were settled under the watchful eye of the Roman military.

In 9 AD, Deudorix, son of Baetorix, joined the Germanic rebellion of Arminius, of the Cherusci, which annihilated the 3 Roman legions of Publius Quinctilius Varus. After the defeat of this alliance, Deudorix was among the captives paraded in Rome during the triumph of Germanicus.

Strabo, writing around 20 AD, described the position of Sicambri using similar words to Caesar, and possibly based upon them. He placed them next to the Menapii, &quot;who dwell on both sides of the river Rhine near its mouth, in marshes and low thorny woods. It is opposite to these Menapii that the Sicambri are situated&quot;. Strabo describes them as Germanic, and notes that beyond them are the Suevi and other peoples. Elsewhere however, Strabo mentions that the Rhine valley Germans have mainly been displaced: &quot;there are but few remaining, and some portion of them are Sicambri&quot;. He apparently understood their position on the Rhine to literally be on the coast. With the German wars still on-going, he describes them as being one of the most well-known Germanic tribes in his time.

In contrast to those Sicambri who were moved west of the Rhine, the main part of the Sicambri &quot;migrated deep into the country anticipating the Romans&quot; according to Strabo. It has been suggested that the Marsi were a part of the Sicambri who managed to stay east of the Rhine after most had been moved from the area to join the Eburones and other cisrhenic Germans. By the time of Rome&#x27;s conflict with the British Silures, Tacitus reports that the Sicambri could be mentioned as an historical example of a tribe who &quot;had been formerly destroyed or transplanted into Gaul&quot;.

Claudius Ptolemy, in the second century AD, still located the Sicambri, together with the Bructeri Minores, at the most northern part of the Rhine and south of the Frisii who inhabit the coast north of the river. However it is likely that this part of his geography was based upon earlier Roman authors.

== Legacy ==
Although the Sicambri ceased to exist as an independent political entity in 8 BC, their legacy was preserved through the traditional names of three Roman auxiliary cohorts, and a Roman literary tradition which portrayed them as archetypical warlike savages, with a resistance to higher culture. 

In 26 AD, some Sicambrian auxiliaries allied to Rome were involved in crushing an uprising of Thracian tribesmen. All inscriptions found mentioning the Sicambri are from the period 76-157 AD, with the exception of one uncertain example from Mauretania in North Africa, which is dated to 255 AD. After this the only clear surviving records of the Sicambri are as a literary trope. There are around 20 inscriptions mentioning the &quot;cohortes Sugambrorum&quot; found mainly in the north of the Balkans, where they apparently helped defend the Lower Danube frontier regions in present day Romania, Bulgaria, and North Macedonia. Others are found in Turkey, and the city of Rome itself.

As a literary stereotype the Sicambri were used by some of the best-known poets of the Augustan era, setting an example for later literature. For example, in the later part of the first century AD, Martial, in his &quot;Liber De Spectaculis&quot;, a series of epigrams written to celebrate the games in the Colosseum under Titus or Domitian, noted the attendance of numerous peoples, including the Sicambri: &quot;With locks twisted into a knot, are come the Sicambrians...&quot; Another poet who used this trope was Horace, in his &quot;Odes&quot;.

Centuries later, authors of Late Antiquity used the Sicambri name as a literate alias for the Franks which was a new name that covered the various tribes of the same region where the Sicambri had lived. This was part of a bigger tendency in literature. For example, the Goths, who similarly appeared in the third century, were routinely called Getae or Scythians. Authors who referred to the Franks as Sicambri included Claudian in a panegyric of about 400 AD, Sidonius Apollinaris, Venantius Fortunatus, 

This literary tradition had an influence lasting into the early middle ages. In the 6th century, Gregory of Tours reports that when Clovis I was baptised by Saint Remigius in 496 this bishop called Clovis a &quot;Sigamber&quot;, while referring to past barbarity: &quot;Bow your gentle neck, Sigamber; adore what you have burned, burn what you have adored.&quot; (&quot;Mitis depone colla, Sigamber; adora quod incendisti, incende quod adorasti.&quot;)

Some scholars such as Wallace-Hadrill have proposed that this special prominence of the Sicambri among the likely ancestors of the Merovingians must indicate that the Merovingian dynasty believed itself to be specifically descended from them.

==Sicambri in the Frankish origins myth==
A tradition which Gregory of Tours reports to have been widely believed, was that the Franks, like the Romans, descended from the ancient Trojans. In some versions of this myth the name of the Sicambri seems to have had a role. According to this myth, after the fall of Troy, the ancestors of the Franks moved first to the Danube, in Roman Pannonia, and from there to the Rhine valley. Later mediaeval authors writing in the seventh and eighth centuries reported more elaborate and fanciful versions of this Pannonia myth, and one version mentions a Frankish city in Pannonia called Sicambria. 

The &quot;Liber Historiae Francorum&quot;, written in 727 AD, asserts that after Troy&#x27;s fall, two leaders called Priam and Antenor lead some 12,000 men to the river Tanais (now called the Don, in Russia) and from there they settled in Pannonia, which the author wrongly understood to adjoin the Sea of Azov. In Pannonia they constructed a city called Sicambria. A Roman emperor called Valentinian, offering remission of taxes, incited the Franks to fight the Alans in the Maeotic Swamps on the Sea of Azov. But after the tax remission elapsed the Franks killed Valentinian&#x27;s tax collectors, leading to a battle in which king Priam died. The Franks then left Pannonia behind for the Rhine valley. (The &quot;Chronicle of Fredegar&quot;, in contrast, asserts that these Trojan Franks founded a city on the Rhine named after their ancestral city of &quot;Troy&quot;. This apparently refers to Xanten, the fort built to confront the Sicambri, and known in Latin as Colonia Ulpia Traiana, after the emperor Trajan.)

These legends are rejected by modern scholars since there is no evidence that the Franks originated anywhere other than the Rhine valley. Scholars have nevertheless made various speculations about the original sources of the myth, which may have included misunderstandings of real events. For example, Ian Wood has suggested that the claim of Trojan ancestry, and thus kinship with the Romans, may have been encouraged by Roman diplomacy, because a similar story seems to have developed for the Burgundians in this period.

<text>SBS Broadcasting Group (SBS), formerly Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems, was a European multinational media group, operating commercial television, premium pay channels, radio stations and related print businesses in Northern, Western and Central and Eastern Europe. It became the second-largest broadcaster in Europe.

==History==
SBS was founded by Harry E. Sloan in 1989, who bought a stake in the Danish station Kanal 2 (a local station in Copenhagen, now Kanal 4) and Norwegian TVNorge. In 1991, Sloan bought the Swedish Nordic Channel, which was soon renamed Kanal 5 and became the third-largest commercial broadcaster in the country. The company was originally known as &quot;TV1&quot;, but was renamed &quot;Scandinavian Broadcasting Systems&quot; in 1991. After expanding into Benelux and Eastern Europe, the name was changed again, this time to SBS. By July 1994, the time of the CC/ABC-Disney merger, Capital Cities/ABC owned 23% of SBS.

In March 2005, SBS acquired C More Entertainment, a Nordic pay tv provider operating under the Canal+ brand. In that year, SBS was bought by the equity firms Permira and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). Telegraaf Media Groep of the Netherlands was also a shareholder in SBS, with a 20% equity interest. Permira and KKR also bought the German broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media in early 2007, and on 27 June 2007 it was announced that ProSiebenSat.1 Media acquired the SBS Broadcasting group for 3.3 billion euros from the joint owners. ProSiebenSat.1 Media became the second-largest broadcaster of Europe with 48 TV stations.

Starting in 2011, ProSiebenSat.1 Media started to sell its non-German properties. The Dutch operations have been bought by Sanoma and Talpa Media Holding on 20 April 2011. In the end of 2011 ProSiebenSat.1 Group has sold its Bulgarian radio stations as well as the music channel the Voice TV to A.E. Best Success Services Bulgaria EOOD. The transaction was closed on 10 November 2011. On 14 December 2012, Discovery Communications bought the Nordic portion of SBS for $1.7 billion. The radio stations were later sold to Bauer Media Group. The Romanian TV and radio operations were bought by Romanian businessman Cristian Burci and Antenna Group in 2013.

<doc id="968873" wikidata="Q545991" url="?curid=968873" title="Artificial ventilation">
<text>Artificial ventilation or respiration is when a machine assists in a metabolic process to exchange gases in the body by pulmonary ventilation, external respiration, and internal respiration. A machine called a ventilator provides the person air manually by moving air in and out of the lungs when an individual is unable to breathe on their own. The ventilator prevents the accumulation of carbon dioxide so that the lungs don&#x27;t collapse due to the low pressure. The use of artificial ventilation can be traced back to the seventeenth century. There are three ways of exchanging gases in the body: manual methods, mechanical ventilation, and neurostimulation.

Here are some key words used throughout the article. The process of forcing air into and out of the lungs is known as ventilation. The process by which oxygen is taken in by the bloodstream is called oxygenation. Lung compliance is the capacity of the lungs to contract and expand. The obstruction of airflow via the respiratory tract is known as airway resistance. The amount of ventilated air that is not involved in gas exchange is known as dead-space ventilation.

==Types==
===Manual methods===
Pulmonary ventilation is done by manual insufflation of the lungs either by the rescuer blowing into the patient&#x27;s lungs (mouth-to-mouth resuscitation), or by using a mechanical device. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is also part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) making it an essential skill for first aid. In some situations, mouth to mouth is also performed separately, for instance in near-drowning and opiate overdoses. The performance of mouth to mouth on its own is now limited in most protocols to health professionals, whereas lay first aiders are advised to undertake full CPR in any case where the patient is not breathing. This method of insufflation has been proved more effective than methods which involve mechanical manipulation of the patient&#x27;s chest or arms, such as the Silvester method.

===Mechanical ventilation===
Mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. This involves the use of ventilator assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag valve mask. Mechanical ventilation is termed &quot;invasive&quot; if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endotracheal tube) or the skin (such as a tracheostomy tube). There are two main modes of mechanical ventilation within the two divisions: positive pressure ventilation, where air (or another gas mix) is pushed into the trachea, and negative pressure ventilation, where air is, in essence, sucked into the lungs.

Tracheal intubation is often used for short-term mechanical ventilation. It&#x27;s when a tube is inserted through the nose (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the trachea. In most cases tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought to provide the best protection against aspiration. Downside of tracheal tubes is the pain and coughing that follows. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anesthetized, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the nasopharynx or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.

In an emergency a cricothyrotomy can be used by health care professionals, where an airway is inserted through a surgical opening in the cricothyroid membrane. This is similar to a tracheostomy but a cricothyrotomy is reserved for emergency access. This is usually only used when there is a complete blockage of the pharynx or there is massive maxillofacial injury, preventing other adjuncts being used.

===Neurostimulation===
A rhythmic pacing of the diaphragm is caused with the help of electrical impulses. Diaphragm pacing is a technique used by persons with spinal cord injuries who are on a mechanical ventilator to aid with breathing, speaking, and overall quality of life. It may be possible to reduce reliance on a mechanical ventilator with diaphragm pacing. Historically, this has been accomplished through the electrical stimulation of a phrenic nerve by an implanted receiver/electrode, though today an alternative option of attaching percutaneous wires to the diaphragm exists.

==History==
The Greek physician Galen may have been the first to describe artificial ventilation: &quot;If you take a dead animal and blow air through its larynx through a reed, you will fill its bronchi and watch its lungs attain the greatest distention.&quot; Vesalius too describes ventilation by inserting a reed or cane into the trachea of animals.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1773, when an English physician William Hawes (1736–1808) began publicizing the power of artificial ventilation to resuscitate people who superficially appeared to have drowned. For a year he paid a reward out of his own pocket to any one bringing him a body rescued from the water within a reasonable time of immersion. Thomas Cogan who was another English physician had become interested in the same subject during a stay at Amsterdam. 

In the summer of 1774, Hawes and Cogan each brought fifteen friends to a meeting at the Chapter Coffee-house in St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, where they founded the Royal Humane Society. Some methods and equipment were similar to methods used today, such as wooden pipes used in the victims nostrils to blow air into the lungs. Or the use of bellows with a flexible tube for blowing tobacco smoke through the anus to revive vestigial life in the victim&#x27;s intestines, which was discontinued with the eventual further understanding of respiration.

The work of English physician and physiologist Marshall Hall in 1856 suggested against the use of any type of bellows/positive pressure ventilation. These views that were held for several decades. The introduction of a common method of external manual manipulation in 1858, was the &quot;Silvester Method&quot; invented by Henry Robert Silvester. A method in which a patient is laid on their back and their arms are raised above their head to aid inhalation and then pressed against their chest to aid exhalation. In 1903, another manual technique, the &quot;prone pressure&quot; method, was introduced by Sir Edward Sharpey Schafer. It involved placing the patient on his stomach and applying pressure to the lower part of the ribs. It was the standard method of artificial respiration taught in Red Cross and similar first aid manuals for decades, until mouth-to-mouth resuscitation became the preferred technique in mid-century.

The shortcomings of manual manipulation led doctors in the 1880s to come up with improved methods of mechanical ventilation, which included Dr. George Edward Fell&#x27;s &quot;Fell method&quot; or &quot;Fell Motor.&quot; It consisted of a bellows and a breathing valve to pass air through a tracheotomy. He collaboratied with Dr. Joseph O&#x27;Dwyer to invent the Fell-O&#x27;Dwyer apparatus, which is a bellows instrument for the insertion and extraction of a tube down the patients trachea. Such methods were still looked upon as harmful and were not adopted for many years.

In 2020, the supply of mechanical ventilation became a central question for public health officials due to 
2019–20 coronavirus pandemic related shortages.

<doc id="968876" wikidata="Q2618824" url="?curid=968876" title="Caril Ann Fugate">
<text>Caril Ann Fugate (born July 30, 1943) is the youngest female in United States history to have been tried and convicted of first-degree murder. She was the adolescent girlfriend of spree killer Charles Starkweather, being just 14 years old when his murders took place in 1958. She was convicted as his accomplice and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1976, she was paroled after serving 18 years.

==Background to crime spree==
Fugate lived in Lincoln, Nebraska with her mother and stepfather. She attended Whittier Junior High School in Lincoln and was an intelligent student who was well-liked by her peers. In 1956, at age 13, she formed a relationship with Charles Starkweather, a high school dropout five years her senior. They met through Caril&#x27;s sister, Barbara, who was dating Starkweather&#x27;s friend, Bob von Busch.
On January 21, 1958, Starkweather shot and killed Fugate&#x27;s stepfather, Marion Bartlett, and her mother, Velda. Starkweather then clubbed to death Fugate&#x27;s two-year-old half-sister, Betty Jean. Fugate claimed she came home to find Starkweather there alone, waiting for her with a gun. She said he told her that her family was being held hostage and that if she did exactly as he said, her family would be safe. During the next six days, Starkweather kept Fugate in the house and turned away all visitors, which made Fugate&#x27;s relatives suspicious. The bodies were found later in outbuildings on the property.
==Cross-state crime spree==
Starkweather and Fugate then fled, driving across Nebraska and ultimately into Wyoming on a murder spree that claimed seven more lives, plus those of two dogs, before they were arrested on January 29. She admitted holding a .410 bore shotgun on a young high school couple, Robert Jensen and Carol King.

==Sentencing==
Starkweather was sentenced to death and executed in the electric chair on June 25, 1959. He insisted that although he had personally killed most of the victims, Fugate had murdered several as well. Although she continued to maintain her innocence, she was tried and convicted for her role in the murder spree. Based on the evidence presented that Fugate had opportunities to leave her captivity and Starkweather&#x27;s own testimony, the jury found her claim that she was Starkweather&#x27;s hostage not credible. She was sentenced to life imprisonment at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women in York, Nebraska.

In 1973, the Nebraska Board of Pardons commuted Fugate&#x27;s sentence to 30–50 years, making her eligible for parole. Governor J. James Exon and Secretary of State Allen J. Beermann voted in favor of the commutation, while Attorney General Clarence A. H. Meyer dissented.

==Release from prison==
Considered to be a model prisoner, Fugate was paroled on June 20, 1976, from York Women&#x27;s Reformatory in York, Nebraska, after serving 18 years&#x27; incarceration. She lived for a time in the Lansing, Michigan, area after being paroled. Following her release, Fugate worked as a janitorial assistant and a nanny. She has since retired.

In 2007, Fugate married Fredrick Clair, a machinist who also worked as a weather observer for the National Weather Service. Their most recent city of residence was Hillsdale, Michigan.

Fugate was seriously injured on August 5, 2013, in a single-vehicle accident near Tekonsha, Michigan. Her husband, who was driving their sport utility vehicle when it went off the road and overturned, died at the scene.

Fugate, going by her married name of Caril Ann Clair, was denied a pardon by the Nebraska Board of Pardons in February 2020. Relatives of the murder victims supported her pardon application. She maintained her innocence in the 1958 slayings and requested a pardon to &quot;alleviate the burden&quot; of being known as a convicted killer. Her pardon was denied because the role of a pardon is to restore a felon&#x27;s rights and because her request was too broad for the parole board.

==Legacy==
===Film and television===
The Starkweather–Fugate case inspired the films &quot;The Sadist&quot; (1963), &quot;Badlands&quot; (1973), &quot;Kalifornia&quot; (1993), &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994) and &quot;Starkweather&quot; (2004). Fugate was portrayed by Fairuza Balk in the made-for-TV biographical film &quot;Murder in the Heartland&quot; (1993), with Tim Roth starring as Starkweather. &quot;Stark Raving Mad&quot; (1981), a film starring Russell Fast and Marcie Severson, provides a fictionalized account of the Starkweather–Fugate murder spree.

Fugate appeared on a 1983 episode of &quot;Lie Detector&quot; hosted by F. Lee Bailey.

The 1996 Peter Jackson film &quot;The Frighteners&quot; features central plot elements with characters almost identical to Starkweather and Fugate, who commit a murder spree. The fourth episode, &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, of season three from the ID series &quot;Deadly Women&quot; (aired September 2, 2010) was about the Starkweather–Fugate murders. The first episode, &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot;, of season four from the Investigation Discovery series &quot;A Crime to Remember&quot; (aired December 6, 2016) portrays the murders and subsequent trial. &quot;The Thirteenth Step&quot;, the January 11, 2011, episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, depicts newlyweds on a North Dakota-Montana killing spree similar to the Starkweather–Fugate case.

An investigative true-crime documentary miniseries that portrayed Fugate as the titular &quot;12th Victim&quot; of Starkweather was released on Showtime in February 2023.

===Literature===
The 1974 book &quot;Caril&quot; is an unauthorized biography of Fugate written by Ninette Beaver, B.K. Ripley (pen name of Alexandra Ripley), and Patrick Trese. Liza Ward, the granddaughter of victims C. Lauer and Clara Ward, wrote the 2004 novel &quot;Outside Valentine&quot;, based on the events of the Starkweather–Fugate murder-spree. The book &quot;Pro Bono: The 18-Year Defense of Caril Ann Fugate&quot; by Jeff McArthur follows Fugate&#x27;s defense team through the trial and appeals process.

In 2011, art photographer Christian Patterson released &quot;Redheaded Peckerwood&quot;, a collection of photos taken each January from 2005 to 2010 along the 500-mile route traversed by Starkweather and Fugate. The book includes reproductions of documents and photographs of objects that belonged to Starkweather, Fugate, and their victims.

<doc id="968879" wikidata="Q1699956" url="?curid=968879" title="Vortex tube">
<text>The vortex tube, also known as the Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube, is a mechanical device that separates a compressed gas into hot and cold streams. The gas emerging from the hot end can reach temperatures of , and the gas emerging from the cold end can reach . It has no moving parts and is considered an environmentally friendly technology because it can work solely on compressed air and does not use Freon. Its efficiency is low, however, counteracting its other environmental advantages.

Pressurised gas is injected tangentially into a &quot;swirl chamber&quot; near one end of a tube, leading to a rapid rotation—the first vortex—as it moves along the inner surface of the tube to the far end. A conical nozzle allows gas specifically from this outer layer to escape at that end through a valve. The remainder of the gas is forced to return in an inner vortex of reduced diameter within the outer vortex. Gas from the inner vortex transfers energy to the gas in the outer vortex, so the outer layer is hotter at the far end than it was initially. The gas in the central vortex is likewise cooler upon its return to the starting-point, where it is released from the tube.

== Method of operation ==

To explain the temperature separation in a vortex tube, there are two main approaches:

=== Fundamental approach: the physics ===

This approach is based on first-principles physics alone and is not limited to vortex tubes only, but applies to moving gas in general. It shows that temperature separation in a moving gas is due only to enthalpy conservation in a moving frame of reference.

The thermal process in the vortex tube can be estimated in the following way:

The main physical phenomenon of the vortex tube is the temperature separation between the cold vortex core and the warm vortex periphery. The &quot;vortex tube effect&quot; is fully explained with the work equation of Euler, also known as Euler&#x27;s turbine equation, which can be written in its most general vectorial form as:

:formula_1,

where formula_2 is the total, or stagnation temperature of the rotating gas at radial position formula_3, the absolute gas velocity as observed from the stationary frame of reference is denoted with formula_4; the angular velocity of the system is formula_5 and formula_6 is the isobaric heat capacity of the gas. This equation was published in 2012; it explains the fundamental operating principle of vortex tubes (Here&#x27;s a video with animated demonstration of how this works). The search for this explanation began in 1933 when the vortex tube was discovered and continued for more than 80 years.

The above equation is valid for an adiabatic turbine passage; it clearly shows that while gas moving towards the center is getting colder, the peripheral gas in the passage is &quot;getting faster&quot;. Therefore, vortex cooling is due to angular propulsion. The more the gas cools by reaching the center, the more rotational energy it delivers to the vortex and thus the vortex rotates even faster. This explanation stems directly from the law of energy conservation. Compressed gas at room temperature is expanded in order to gain speed through a nozzle; it then climbs the centrifugal barrier of rotation during which energy is also lost. The lost energy is delivered to the vortex, which speeds its rotation. In a vortex tube, the cylindrical surrounding wall confines the flow at periphery and thus forces conversion of kinetic into internal energy, which produces hot air at the hot exit.

Therefore, the vortex tube is a rotorless turboexpander. It consists of a rotorless radial inflow turbine (cold end, center) and a rotorless centrifugal compressor (hot end, periphery). The work output of the turbine is converted into heat by the compressor at the hot end.

=== Phenomenological approach ===
This approach relies on observation and experimental data. It is specifically tailored to the geometrical shape of the vortex tube and the details of its flow and is designed to match the particular observables of the complex vortex tube flow, namely turbulence, acoustic phenomena, pressure fields, air velocities and many others. The earlier published models of the vortex tube are phenomenological. They are:

# Radial pressure difference: centrifugal compression and air expansion
# Radial transfer of angular momentum
# Radial acoustic streaming of energy
# Radial heat pumping

More on these models can be found in recent review articles on vortex tubes.

The phenomenological models were developed at an earlier time when the turbine equation of Euler was not thoroughly analyzed; in the engineering literature, this equation is studied mostly to show the work output of a turbine; while temperature analysis is not performed since turbine cooling has more limited application unlike power generation, which is the main application of turbines. Phenomenological studies of the vortex tube in the past have been useful in presenting empirical data. However, due to the complexity of the vortex flow this empirical approach was able to show only aspects of the effect but was unable to explain its operating principle. Dedicated to empirical details, for a long time the empirical studies made the vortex tube effect appear enigmatic and its explanation – a matter of debate.

==History==

The vortex tube was invented in 1931 by French physicist Georges J. Ranque. It was rediscovered by Paul Dirac in 1934 while he was searching for a device to perform isotope separation, leading to development of the Helikon vortex separation process. German physicist improved the design and published a widely read paper in 1947 on the device, which he called a &quot;Wirbelrohr&quot; (literally, whirl pipe). 
In 1954, Westley published a comprehensive survey entitled &quot;A bibliography and survey of the vortex tube&quot;, which included over 100 references. In 1951 Curley and McGree, in 1956 Kalvinskas, in 1964 Dobratz, in 1972 Nash, and in 1979 Hellyar made important contribution to the RHVT literature by their extensive reviews on the vortex tube and its applications.
From 1952 to 1963, C. Darby Fulton, Jr. obtained four U.S. patents relating to the development of the vortex tube. In 1961, Fulton began manufacturing the vortex tube under the company name Fulton Cryogenics. Fulton sold the company to Vortec, Inc. The vortex tube was used to separate gas mixtures, oxygen and nitrogen, carbon dioxide and helium, carbon dioxide and air in 1967 by Linderstrom-Lang.

Vortex tubes also seem to work with liquids to some extent, as demonstrated by Hsueh and Swenson in a laboratory experiment where free body rotation occurs from the core and a thick boundary layer at the wall. Air is separated causing a cooler air stream coming out the exhaust hoping to chill as a refrigerator. In 1988 R. T. Balmer applied liquid water as the working medium. It was found that when the inlet pressure is high, for instance 20-50 bar, the heat energy separation process exists in incompressible (liquids) vortex flow as well. Note that this separation is only due to heating; there is no longer cooling observed since cooling requires compressibility of the working fluid.

==Efficiency==
Vortex tubes have lower efficiency than traditional air conditioning equipment. They are commonly used for inexpensive spot cooling, when compressed air is available.

==Applications==

===Current applications===
Commercial vortex tubes are designed for industrial applications to produce a temperature drop of up to . With no moving parts, no electricity, and no refrigerant, a vortex tube can produce refrigeration up to using 100 standard cubic feet per minute (2.832 m3/min) of filtered compressed air at . A control valve in the hot air exhaust adjusts temperatures, flows and refrigeration over a wide range.

Vortex tubes are used for cooling of cutting tools (lathes and mills, both manually-operated and CNC machines) during machining. The vortex tube is well-matched to this application: machine shops generally already use compressed air, and a fast jet of cold air provides both cooling and removal of the chips produced by the tool. This eliminates or drastically reduces the need for liquid coolant, which is messy, expensive, and environmentally hazardous.

<text>Tongyeong (; ) is a coastal city in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It has an area of and in 2010, a population of 139,869 people. It is divided into 1 eup (town), 6 myeon (township) and 11 dong (neighborhood). Chungmu city and Tongyeong county were reunited in 1995, creating Tongyeong as it is known today. It consists of Goseong Peninsula, Hansando, , and other islets. It was formerly known as Chungmu, after the posthumous name of Admiral Yi Sun-sin. The name Tongyeong means &quot;command post&quot; and is itself associated with Admiral Yi, as it refers to his principal base that was located on nearby Hansan Island.

==Notable people==
Notable people associated with the city include Yi Sun-sin, whose headquarters were located there, and Yun Isang, a noted 20th-century composer.

Chungmu Halmae, or &quot;Chungmu Grandmother&quot;, is a mythical old woman from Chungmu who gave her name to Chungmu Halmae Kimbap, a common Korean snack food. Chungmu Halmae, though mythical, is one of the most recognized personages from the area. The decision to group together a number of entities and incorporate them into the city of &quot;Tongyong&quot; erased the name Chungmu from the map of Korea and removed the home of the mythical grandmother from the peninsula.

Park Kyung-ni was a novelist, who wrote the well-known novel Toji (토지, The Land) consisting of a 16-volume story, in Korea.

Shin Suk-ja is a political prisoner held in Yodok political prison camp in North Korea. In August 2011 human rights activists from her hometown started the &quot;Daughter of Tongyeong Rescue Campaign&quot; to rescue her and her children.

Song Hyeong-jun is a member of South Korean boyband Cravity. He was also a former member of South Korean boyband X1 (band). He is best known for competing in survival show Produce X 101 and ranking 4th in the finale.

The football player Kim Min-jae was born in Tongyeong and played football for Tongyeong Elementary School football club. He plays as a centre-back for Bayern Munich and the South Korea national team.

==Sports==
Tongyeong was the site of the first race of 2009 in the International Triathlon Union-sponsored ITU World Championship Series, which encompasses &quot;international-distance&quot; triathlon events in cities around the world. On May 3, 2009, Bevan Docherty of New Zealand won the men&#x27;s race in a thrilling photo finish as he crossed the line almost simultaneously with Brad Kahlefeldt of Australia.

==Healthcare==
In 2007, the total number of medical institutions was 106, including 4 hospitals, 63 clinics, one long-term care hospital, 22 dental hospitals, 16 Korean traditional medicine clinics. There are also 23 medical institutions related to Tongyeong Health Center affiliated to the Tongyeong City government.

==Food==
There are several famous food in Tongyeong. Chungmu gimbap (충무김밥) and Ggulbbang (통영꿀빵), a honey bread dessert. Chungmu gimbab is Korean sushi made of seaweed and rice. It is served with baby octopus with spicy sauce. Chungmu gimbab is a popular traditional food in Tongyeong, which used to be called Chungmu.

Ppattegi gruel is a porridge made of dried sweet potatoes.

Sweet potatoes on Yokji Island in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang Province, are famous. The sweet potato fields cover more than 70 percent of the slopes here, as they are useful for draining water. The abundant sunlight creates an optimal environment for sweet potato cultivation. It is said that the sea raised the sweet potatoes, hence the name &quot;Sweet potatoes grown under the sea breeze.&quot;

==Education==

Tongyeong has several representative traditional educational institutions such as Unjudang (), Baegun Seojae (), Tongyeong Hyanggyo (). Unjudang established on Hansan Island in 1592, took charge of military education of the Joseon navy. It was later reconstructed with the changed name as &quot;Jeseungdang&quot; (). Baegun Seojae was a &quot;seodang&quot;, a private village school providing elementary education. Go Si-wan, a &quot;Silhak&quot; (practical learning) scholar founded it in 1805, the fifth year of King Sunjo&#x27;s reign. Baegun Seojae is currently situated in the neighborhood of Docheon-dong and designated as the ninth Cultural Material of South Gyeongsang Province. Tongyeong Hyanggyo was a state-sponsored provincial school (&quot;hyanggyo&quot;) and was built in the site of the old Goseong Hyanggyo, which consists of 6 buildings; Daeseongjeon, Dongmu, Seomu, Myeongnyundang, Seojae, and Punghwaru. In the Daeseongjeon shrine, memorial tablets of five prominent scholars and Confucius are instituted.

Modern educational institutions started to be established in the city as Jinnam Commons School, the predecessor of Tongyeong Elementary School was opened in 1908. The educational system of Tongyeong is the same as elsewhere in the country. Schooling begins with preschools, of which there are 34 in the city. This is followed by 6 years in elementary schools, of which Tongyeong has 32 including 14 branch schools. Subsequently, students pass through 3 years of middle school. There are 11 middle schools in Tongyeong. High-school education, which lasts for three years, is not compulsory, but the most students do attend and graduate from high school. Tongyeong is home to 5 high schools. The College of Marine Science at Gyeongsang National University (GNU) is a branch campus in Tongyeong, specializing in marine-related studies. Its predecessor was Tongyeong Marine College, the successor of Gyeongnam Susan Jeonseupso () founded in 1917. The college was integrated into Gyeongsang National University in 1994.

==Tourism==

Tongyeong is a representative tourist city in the South Sea region of Gyeongsangnam-do. It has beaches, islands, and various historical sites based on its natural environment. Novelist Pak Kyongni, poet Yu Chi-hwan, and composer Isang Yun are from Tongyeong, and there are various cultural contents related to them.

Tongyeong attracted 5.35 million visitors in 2014, 7.35 million in 2017, and 6.28 million in 2018. Tongyeong has the nickname of &quot;Naples of the East&quot;.

In 2022, Tongyeong was selected as the first specialized night tourism city in South Korea. This selection was part of the &#x27;2022 Specialized Night Tourism City Public Contest&#x27; hosted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Tourism Organization.

Tongyeong planned various night tourism contents under the theme of &#x27;Nine o&#x27;clock at night, Five Lights Tongyeong&#x27;. This includes DPIRANG (the longest and largest outdoor night digital theme park in Korea), Dongpirang (Mural Village), Gangguan Port (Tongyeong Traditional Central Market), Tongjeyeong (history and culture of Tongyeong), Seopirang Village (night view lighting), etc., which are five night tourism spots.

==Geography==

Tongyeong is situated in the southern tip of Goseong peninsula and its three sides are surrounded by the sea. It consists of 41 inhabited and 110 uninhabited islands. Tongyeong Port, the east gate of Hallyeo Marine National Park, is referred to as the &quot;most beautiful port in South Korea&quot;.

The geography consists of low mountains crossing over the south to the north on the Goseong peninsula. The mountain range stretches out from Byeokbang mountain (650 m) on the boundary of northern Goseong county (Goseong-gun) to the south, encompassing Cheongae mountain (525 m), Baral mountain (261 m), Jeseokbong peak (279 m) and Yongha mountain (461 m) on Mireukdo island.

As Tongyeong is influenced by East Korea Warm Current, it has a mild oceanic climate during the whole year. The city is the warmest region in South Gyeongsang province, with the average annual temperature at . The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of 2.5 °C while the hottest month is August, with the average temperature of 25.7 °C. The average range of temperature is narrow. Plants growing in the city show characters of the warm temperate zone such as &quot;Cryptomeria&quot;, &quot;Chamaecyparis obtusa&quot;, &quot;Pinus thunbergii&quot;, &quot;Paulownia coreana&quot;, Pitch Pine, bamboo, camellia, and palm trees.

The average annual rainfall is 1,397 millimeters, so Tongyeong is classified as one of places in South Korea that receive a lot of rain.

===Climate===
Tongyeong has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;).

<doc id="968884" wikidata="Q6672525" url="?curid=968884" title="Long Ditton">
<text>Long Ditton is a residential suburb in the borough of Elmbridge, Surrey, England on the boundary with the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, London. In medieval times it was a village, occupying a narrow strip of land. Neighbouring settlements include Hinchley Wood, Thames Ditton and Surbiton.

Its northernmost part is south-west of central Kingston upon Thames, 11.3 miles from Charing Cross, and north-east of Guildford. It is divided in two by the South West Main Line and is bordered by a straight east–west spur road to meet the A3 in a cutting to the south. The old Portsmouth Road passes by the River Thames in the northern end of the village, and the riverbank here is privately owned.

In both local economy and public transport, the high street and railway stations at Hinchley Wood and Surbiton are the nearest such amenities.

==History==

Ditton was a Saxon settlement which, by Domesday, was a single ecclesiastical parish but split in two, as it remains. This split was between the riverside manor and parish of Thames Ditton, and the longer, eastern area, Long Ditton, which is a long rectangle of land extending from developed land by the River Thames to Ditton Hill. Nowadays Ditton Hill reaches beyond the wide A3 and A309 as far as Woodstock Lane South, much of which is in Claygate parish (and has an Esher postal address).

Two Dittons appear in the Domesday Book of 1086 and were written as &quot;Ditone&quot; and &quot;Ditune&quot;. The one that became known as Long Ditton was held by Robert Picot from (i.e. under) Richard Fitz Gilbert. The one that became known as Thames Ditton was held by Wadard under Bishop Odo. Long Ditton&#x27;s Domesday assets were: 4 hides; 1 church, 1 mill worth 9s, 3½ ploughs, woodland for 15 hogs, 1 house in Southwark paying 500 herrings. It rendered £2 10s 0d.

Henry I granted all four chapelries neighbouring Kingston to Merton Priory, therefore it is uncertain whether the manor had a church or chapel at Long Ditton in that period. Until the early 20th century the parish had two non-contiguous parts, Long Ditton proper and an exclave in Tolworth. A strip of Kingston parish, its hamlet of Hook, lay between the two parts. The western portion, Long Ditton proper, had and had near-identical boundaries to today&#x27;s ecclesiastical parish.

In 1565 the manor was bought by George Evelyn, whose family produced gunpowder here for several generations, with gunpowder mills proliferating across Long Ditton and beyond. The Evelyns bought up much of the country that was heavily involved in the English Civil War, using the profits from gunpowder. George&#x27;s grandson John Evelyn, who gained posthumous fame for his &quot;Diary&quot;, had to flee the country during the Civil War as swathes of family land fell awkwardly between Royalist and Parliamentarian strongholds. It was John who gleaned further prestige for the family name with his assimilation into the Royal Court of Charles II. When St Mary&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1880, and monuments erected to commemorate local dignitaries, there were few other Long Ditton figures to celebrate, and the place became something of an Evelyn shrine.

In 1951 the civil parish had a population of 4007. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
The original church dated in part from the 12th century, with the earliest recorded rector being in 1166. By the 18th century the church had fallen into a bad state of decay and in 1778 a replacement was built on the same site, of a small Greek cross plan, built of brick. This was itself replaced by the present Church of England parish church in 1880. Designed by George Edmund Street and built next to the 18th-century church, it is primarily of buff-covered coursed marble stone with bath stone dressings overlying this in part, forming decorative arches. Remains of the 18th-century church can be seen in the churchyard&#x27;s garden of rest which contains church floor memorials to the Evelyn family, with only one of its memorials moved to the present church building. Both the current and the remains of the 18th-century church are Grade II listed.

By the early 20th century the rectory had become derelict and was demolished. Its greater part was half-timber; it is pictured in Malden&#x27;s &quot;A History of the County of Surrey&quot;, and probably dated from the 16th century.

People buried in the churchyard include global businessman and civil structural engineer Terence Patrick O&#x27;Sullivan, aircraft design engineer Sir Sydney Camm, Indian Army General Sir Orfeur Cavenagh, and Austin Partner, a victim of the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Demography==
A small part of the electoral ward, &quot;Long Ditton&quot;, was in the 2000s exchanged, including adding to Hinchley Wood (south of Hinchley Wood railway station).

The Long Ditton ward&#x27;s population at the 2011 census was 6,343 living in 2,504 households. The total area was unchanged from ten years before at and the density had increased to 27.2 to 29.6 persons per hectare.

==Geography==

The place is one of only two small portions of Elmbridge that is part of a post town outside its area, in this case, Surbiton which is in the neighbouring borough of Kingston upon Thames.

===Soil and Elevation===
Long Ditton&#x27;s soil is chiefly London clay, but to the north is Thames alluvial topsoil, gravel and sand, and it contains two patches of Bagshot Sand in the southern part.

==Economy==

Residential estates have been built on Long Ditton&#x27;s former agricultural land, and it has become a dormitory settlement, and a satellite suburb to Esher, Kingston upon Thames and Surbiton. The nearest railway stations are Thames Ditton, Surbiton and Hinchley Wood. Long Ditton is also served by buses.

It can be claimed that Long Ditton has retained its village character: it has a village hall and a cricket club. It is a clustered village, which has now developed its riverside. Modest green spaces are interspersed with housing in the area; they are principally recreation grounds and do not form buffer zones with other settlements, except some commercial plant nurseries and garden centre businesses which separate Long Ditton from Claygate.

==Residents&#x27; Association==
The Long Ditton Residents&#x27; Association (LDRA - www.longditton.org) is a non-political body whose aims are to preserve Long Ditton from overdevelopment, maintain its character, improve its amenities and defend its remaining surrounding Metropolitan Green Belt.

==Demography and housing==

The average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.
The proportion of households in the settlement who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%. The proportion who owned their home with a loan compares to the regional average of 32.5%. The remaining % is made up of rented dwellings (plus a negligible % of households living rent-free).

==Notable residents==
* Trevor Bowring (1887–1908), first-class cricketer
* Sydney Camm (1893-1966), aeronautical engineer and aeroplane designer.

<text>Hadong County (, &quot;Hadong-gun&quot;) is a county in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. It is on the far-west side of the province, bordering South Jeolla Province. The county office is located at Hadeong-eup.

==History==
The county of Hadong was called &quot;Dasachon&quot; (, &quot;county of much sand&quot;) when it was a part of the Jin state, later becoming a part of &quot;Nangnoguk&quot; (), one of twelve statelets of the Byeonhan confederacy. According to the &quot;History of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the region was called &quot;Handasa-gun&quot; (), then changed into &quot;Hadong-gun&quot; in 757 CE, during the reign of King Gyeongdeok of Silla. During the Goryeo dynasty, the area was known as &quot;Hadong-hyeon&quot; (). In 1414, during the reign of the Joseon-era King Taejong, it became known as &quot;Hanamhyeon&quot; () with &quot;Namhaehyeon&quot; (). It was raised to the status of &quot;Hadongdohobu&quot; () in 1740, in the thirtieth year of King Sukjong&#x27;s reign. During the Korean War the region was the site of a North Korean attack on US Army forces, the Hadong Ambush.

* 1702: Agyang-myeon (악양면, 岳陽面) added to Hadong-gun
* April 1, 1914: Seo-myeon () and Geumyang-myeon () added
* January 1, 1915: Part of Seomjin-ri (), Daap-myeon (), Gwangyang-gun (광양군, 光陽郡), South Jeolla Province added
* 1917: Naehoengbo-myeon () renamed to Hoengcheon-myeon (); Deokyang-myeon () renamed to Jingyo-myeon ()
* January 1, 1933: Geumyang-myeon () was abolished and incorporated into Jingyo-myeon () and Geumnam-myeon (), formerly Nam-myeon ()
* October 1, 1938: Hadong-myeon () elevated to Hadong-eup ()

==Local sights and attractions==
Nestled between the Seomjin River and Mount Jiri, the county is a popular destination for both domestic and foreign tourists who enjoy nature. Parts of the Jirisan National Park lie within the county and form the county&#x27;s notable hilly, mountainous landscape.

The Ssanggyesa (Ssangye Temple) is a notable historic temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and is a designated National Treasure.

Pak Gyeongni&#x27;s 16-volume novel &quot;Land&quot; is partly set in the village of Pyeongsa-ri () in Agyang-myeon, Hadong County. A replica of the fictional Choi family&#x27;s home was built there to commemorate the author&#x27;s legacy.

===Green tea===
Hadong has been famous for its green tea since the Silla era, when an envoy brought green tea seeds from the Tang Empire to be planted locally. The local government has historically promoted this as a major local attraction, including sponsoring a tourism advertisement that aired on CNN in 2007. The annual &quot;wild tea&quot; festival, lasting 25 days, takes place during May and June.

==Development==
While much of Korea has experienced an explosion of industrial development, Hadong remains a destination for those who wish to escape the bustle of city living. However, a lack of activity in the industrial sector has left the government with little incentive to expanding the sometimes inadequate existing road infrastructure. A petition for the allocation of funds for new road construction was signed by a number of Hadong residents.

Former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak has recently announced plans for the construction of a Gyeongsangnam-do leisure resort palace in Hadong.

<text>Lemaire Channel is a strait off Antarctica, between Kyiv Peninsula in the mainland&#x27;s Graham Land and Booth Island. Nicknamed &quot;Kodak Gap&quot; by some, it is one of the top tourist destinations in Antarctica; steep cliffs hem in the iceberg-filled passage, which is long and just wide at its narrowest point.

It was first seen by the German expedition of 1873-74, but not traversed until December 1898, when the &quot;Belgica&quot; of the Belgian Antarctic Expedition passed through. Expedition leader Adrien de Gerlache named it for Charles Lemaire (1863-1925), a Belgian explorer of the Congo.

The channel has since become a standard part of the itinerary for cruising in Antarctica; not only is it scenic, but the protected waters are usually as still as a lake, a rare occurrence in the storm-wracked southern seas, and the north-south traverse delivers vessels close to Petermann Island for landings. The principal difficulty is that icebergs may fill the channel, especially in early season, obliging a ship to backtrack and go around the outside of Booth Island to reach Petermann.

==Features==

Features of the southeast coast of the channel include, from north to south, False Cape Renard, Humphries Heights, Loubat Point, Deloncle Bay, Hotine Glacier, Glandaz Point, Una Peaks, Mount Cloos, Cape Cloos, Leay Glacier, Mount Scott (Antarctica), Duseberg Buttress.

<text>Sligo Abbey () was a Dominican convent in Sligo, Ireland, founded in 1253. It was built in the Romanesque style with some later additions and alterations. Extensive ruins remain, mainly of the church and the cloister.

The site is managed by the Office of Public Works and opens on a seasonal basis - March 17 to November 5 is the 2023 season. Sligo Abbey is open daily from 10.00 am - 6.00 pm, with last admissions at 5.15 pm.

== Name and location ==
The name &quot;Sligo Abbey&quot; is the generally accepted traditional name, but strictly speaking &quot;abbey&quot; is inappropriate as Dominican monasteries are led by priors not abbots: &quot;convent&quot;, &quot;friary&quot;, or &quot;priory&quot; would be more correct. The community was dedicated to the Holy Cross. The ruins are located in Abbey Street, Sligo, but when it was still functioning, the convent lay outside the town&#x27;s limits and its location was then usually described as &quot;near Sligo&quot;.

== History ==
Sligo Abbey, was a Dominican Friary, founded in 1253 by Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly, who was Justiciar of Ireland from 1232 to 1245. His purpose allegedly was to house a community of monks to pray for the soul of Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, whom he was rumoured to have killed. The Dominicans were a poor choice for such a task as their specialty is preaching rather than praying. FitzGerald built a substantial Norman abbey, with all the essential parts and endowed it with lands.

In 1414 the buildings were damaged in an accidental fire. The abbey did not have sufficient means for the reconstruction and appealed to the pope for help. At that moment three men competed with each other in the Vatican Standoff: Benedict XIII was pope in Avignon, Gregory XII in Rome, and John XXIII in Pisa. As England supported John, this was the pope the abbey addressed. Their letter reached John at the Council of Constance (1414–1418). John replied by sending an apostolic letter from Constance granting indulgences of ten years to all who would visit the church on the feast of the Assumption and the day of Saint Patrick and contribute to its restoration. The friary was rebuilt in 1416 by Prior Brian, son of Dermot MacDonagh, tanist (prince) of Tirerrill and Collooney. There were 20 friars at the abbey at that time.

When the Dissolution of the Irish monasteries that had started in 1530 in the Pale, began to menace monasteries in the West of Ireland, Donogh O&#x27;Connor Sligo in 1568 obtained a letter from Queen Elizabeth that exempted Sligo Abbey on condition that the friars would become secular priests.

During Tyrone&#x27;s Rebellion (1594–1603) the abbey was damaged when Richard Bingham, president of Connaught, besieged Sligo Castle in 1595, which was held by Hugh Roe O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s men. Bingham stationed six companies of troops and horses in the Abbey, and dismantled the rood screen, using it and other timber from the building to build a siege tower for his unsuccessful attack on the castle. After the war, at the beginning of the 17th century, the abbey and its lands were granted to Sir William Taaffe in consideration of his services to Queen Elizabeth. Sir William was the grandfather of Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of Carlingford.


In 1608 only one friar was left in the abbey, Father O&#x27;Duane, who died in this year. However, Father Daniel O&#x27;Crean arrived from Spain before O&#x27;Duane&#x27;s death and built up a new community, succeeding so well that in 1627 Ross MacGeoghegan, provincial of the Dominical Order in Ireland, held a provincial chapter in Sligo.

During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) the convent was attacked and burned by Sir Frederick Hamilton in the summer of 1642. Some of the friars were killed.

In 1697 when King William reigned alone, the Irish Parliament passed the Banishment Act, which specified that all ordinaries (bishops) and regular clergy (e.g. monks) must leave the country before 1 May 1698. It did not affect the parish priests, who are classified as secular priests. The Dominicans of Sligo left Ireland for Spain, led by their prior, Father Patrick McDonogh. The abbey stood then empty.

In the 18th century some friars came back to Sligo and stayed in the abbey. In 1760 when Father Lawrence Connellan returned from Louvain to Sligo, he found that the buildings had deteriorated so far that it was necessary to find other accommodation. In 1783 he obtained a lease in High Street and moved there. In the second half of the 18th century, the friars built a chapel in Pound Street. In 1803 a new friary was built. In 1846 Father B. J. Goodman, prior of the friary and provincial of the order, built the Neogothic Holy Cross Church in High Street, and in 1865 another residence for the friars was built behind that church in Dominick Street.

The abbey grounds were used as cemetery. The buildings were quarried for reusable stone. In 1893 Evelyn Ashley, to whom the abbey had come from Lord Palmerston, vested part of it in the Board of Works and the rest followed in 1913, donated by his son Wilfrid William Ashley. The Board then did work on the ruins, freeing them from ivy, bushes and trees growing on it.

== Architecture ==
The abbey ruins consist of the walls of the church, inclusive those of the tower, three sides of the cloister, and remains of the sacristy, the chapter room, the refectory, and the dormitories. Most of the buildings seem to date from the 13th century, the time of the monastery&#x27;s foundation and were built in a late romanesque or more specifically Norman Style. In the 15th century late Gothic additions and replacements were made and some others in the 16th century.

The church was never vaulted and, having lost its wooden roof, stands open to the sky. The church&#x27;s walls are thick and their tops are covered with water tables and crowned with ruinous parapets that might once have been crenulated. The church is divided into the choir (or chancel) in the east and the nave in the west by the 15th-century cut-stone rood screen, that consisted of a gallery across the church supported by ribbed groin vaults, three bays wide and one deep. This rood screen has been partially reconstructed from its surviving right and left abutments in the abbey&#x27;s latest restoration (see photo).

The tower is another 15th-century addition. It is thick-walled and square. It is placed on the main axis of the church just east of the rood screen and suspended over the church by the means of two lofty pointed and profiled arches forming an archway or tunnel that connects the two parts of the church. The underside of the tower is closed by a ribbed and groined fan vault. The tower has a door on its north side that was reached over the roof. With the roof gone, the tower has become inaccessible. The tower resembles those of Kilcrea Friary, Muckross Abbey, Quin Abbey, and Rosserk Friary, but none of those is as daringly suspended.

The church&#x27;s east end is square. The terminal wall holds a large late-Gothic window divided into four lights by mullions. Its head is filled with reticular tracery. This window must have replaced one or several Romanesque windows in the 15th century. In front of this window stands the table of the high altar, the front of which is divided into nine panels decorated with late-gothic cusped arches and foliage in relief. This altar also dates from the Late Gothic.

The nave has the same width as the choir. Its western façade has been destroyed so that the western end of the church stands open. On the southern side the nave was accompanied by an aisle and a one-armed transept (or lateral chapel). Both are later additions. The aisle has been entirely demolished and the transept partially, so that the arcade, consisting of three pointed arches supported by octagonal pillars, is exposed. The transept once held two altars. The naves of Kilcrea Friary, Muckross Abbey, Quin Abbey, and Rosserk Friary have similar one-armed transepts.

The cloister lies to the north of the church as is also the case at Kilcrea Friary, Moyne Abbey, Muckross Abbey, Quin Abbey, and Rosserk Friary. The cloister&#x27;s southern walk runs along the northern wall of the church&#x27;s nave. Only three sides of the cloister remain standing; the western side has been demolished. The cloister walk is covered with rubble barrel vaults. Its arcades are supported by slender pillars reminiscent of double columns. The arches of the arcades and the barrel vaults are slightly pointed. The cloisters of Moyne Abbey and Quin Abbey have similar pillars and vaults. Despite its Romanesque appearance the cloister is attributed to the 15th century.

The sacristy, vestry, and chapter room are in the ground floor of the east range. Excepted the western extension of the chapter room, they are part of the 13th-century core of the abbey. They are covered with rubble barrel vaults similar to those of the cloister. The refectory occupied the first floor of the north range. Only its southern wall above the arcade of the cloister is preserved. From this wall protrudes a ruined oriel window giving light to the reader&#x27;s desk where a friar would read aloud from the scriptures during mealtimes.

== Monuments ==
The church contains two noteworthy funeral monuments: the &quot;O&#x27;Craian altar tomb&quot; and the mural in remembrance of &quot;Sir Donogh O&#x27;Connor Sligo&quot;. O&#x27;Craian&#x27;s tomb is the oldest surviving monument in the church. Its Latin inscription dates it from 1506 and states that it is the tomb of Cormac O&#x27;Craian (or Crean) and his wife Johanna, daughter of Ennis (or Magennis). It fills a niche in the northern wall of the nave next to the rood screen. It consists of a stone table, similar to the altar in the choir, and a canopy consisting of a high pointed arch with tracery. The style is late Gothic.

The O&#x27;Connor mural is on the wall of the choir to the right of the altar. It shows reliefs of O&#x27;Connor and his wife kneeling in prayer in an architectural frame, decorated with heraldic and religious motives. Sir Donogh O&#x27;Connor obtained the letter from Queen Elizabeth that saved the abbey from dissolution, mentioned above. He died in 1609. His wife, Eleanor Butler, daughter of Lord Dunboyne, erected the monument in 1624 in a late Renaissance style. Before O&#x27;Connor she had been married to Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Desmond, who was killed in 1583.

== In popular culture ==
Sligo Abbey appears in two short stories by William Butler Yeats: &quot;The Crucifixion of the Outcast&quot; and &quot;The Curse of the Fires and of the Shadows&quot;. In both stories, the head of the monastery is called the abbot. It is also the subject of what is possibly the oldest surviving painting of any building in Ireland.

<doc id="968910" wikidata="Q1543204" url="?curid=968910" title="Grant Lee Buffalo">
<text>Grant Lee Buffalo was an American rock band based in Los Angeles, California, United States, consisting of Grant-Lee Phillips (vocals and guitar), Paul Kimble (bass) and Joey Peters (drums). 

All three were previously members of another Los Angeles band, Shiva Burlesque. In the late 1980s, Jeffrey Clark, Grant-Lee Phillips, James Brenner and Joey Peters started as a rock music formation called Shiva Burlesque. They released two studio albums, the self-titled &quot;Shiva Burlesque&quot; in 1987 on Nate Starkman &amp; Son Records, and a follow-up (and final) album, &quot;Mercury Blues,&quot; which was released in 1990 on Fundamental Records. Matt Snow in Q Magazine highlighted the Doors and Echo and the Bunnymen as references and described the last album as &quot;great late-night un-easy listening&quot;. Paul Kimble replaced Brenner on bass and the band renamed as Grant Lee Buffalo in 1991.

Phillips, Kimble, and Peters transitioned from Shiva Burlesque’s more psychedelic and experimental sound to create something unique. Grant-Lee Phillips, the creative force in the band, brought with him a unique voice that could be both hauntingly gentle and powerful, paired with a sombre storyteller&#x27;s honesty. This combination would form the core of Grant Lee Buffalo’s identity.

The band’s early influences were a mix of 70s rock, folk, and country, but it was Phillips’ fascination with American history, landscapes, and personal narratives that shaped the band’s lyrical direction. Their sound was further characterized by the use of unconventional instruments and experimental recording techniques, which allowed them to create a distinct atmosphere in their music.

==Career==
Grant Lee Buffalo released four albums in the 1990s, all on Slash Records

 Fuzzy - 1993

When Grant Lee Buffalo cut their debut album, 1993&#x27;s Fuzzy, they had a distinct advantage over most bands making their first trip to the studio -- They had already recorded two LPs together as members of the then-recently defunct Shiva Burlesque, and most of Fuzzy&#x27;s 11 songs dated back to SB&#x27;s latter days. This goes a long way towards explaining how Grant Lee Buffalo were able to make an album as confident and solidly crafted as Fuzzy, combining Phillips&#x27; evocative voice and songwriting, with sympathetic accompanists who had a clear idea of how to tap into the mysterious melodic structures of his music. Paul Kimble was an especially valuable ally in the studio, helping to produce and engineer these recordings and giving this album its full, widescreen sound. The album&#x27;s simplicity and striking dynamics ultimately serve these songs well and songs like &quot;Soft Wolf Tread,&quot; &quot;Dixie Drug Store&quot; and the title track fuse the richly American imagery of the burgeoning alt country movement with a California gothic sensibility that was all their own. Fuzzy&#x27;s deep and mysterious quality was crafted with imagination and care, and it&#x27;s no wonder Grant Lee Buffalo became critic&#x27;s darlings shortly after this was released.

 Mighty Joe Moon - 1994

You put your hands on a ouija board and you get a message from who knows where – that’s what music is like. You never know if you’re moving it, or you’re being moved by it,” explains guitarist/singer/ songwriter Grant Lee Phillips, one-third of L.A.’s Grant Lee Buffalo, on Mighty Joe Moon (Warner Bros.). The band continues to explore its distinctive blend of ethereal, somber folk and big, ungodly noise on their impressive follow-up to last year’s Fuzzy. Phillips and his bandmates, bassist Paul Kimble (also the produces and engineer) and drummer Joey Peters (who has drummed with John Lee Hooker), make use of everything – from pump organs to acquired hunks of metal – to enhance their stories of real America. On the album’s first single, the ballad “Mockingbirds,” Phillips effectively blends a deep baritone with a high falsetto vocal over the songs’ trance-inducing groove. Distorted guitars, mixed with mandolins, banjos, blaring harmonicas are held steady by a very subtle yet strong rhythm section. Lyrically he blazes through politics, love, the human spirit, and ends the album with a very chilling take on his own version of the old hymn Rock of Ages.

 Copperopolis - 1996

Copperopolis has a conceptual conceit that is rich enough to match GLPs plaintive emotion and songwriting craftsmanship. The album&#x27;s title is a nod to a copper-mining town that has fallen on hard times. Songs such as &quot;Arousing Thunder,&quot; &quot;The Bridge&quot; and &quot;Armchair&quot; evoke the dusk-like atmosphere of small-town America, creating cinematic imagery through a summer rainstorm, a barefoot walk across a wooden bridge and a beaten-up old easy chair. But these romantic visions are juxtaposed against the perverted ideals espoused by people who aren&#x27;t quite as tolerant as Phillips and his bohemian band mates. In &quot;Homespun,&quot; the singer rails against the militia movement: &quot;Hear the drummers pound/Listen to the homespun violent sound.&quot; Phillips and the band broaden their palette to include vibraphone, violin and a cheesy synthesizer rescued from a thrift store to make Copperopolis a sometimes eccentric, but always rewarding place to visit.

 Jubilee - 1998

GLB&#x27;s producer and bassist, Paul Kimble, left the group after its third album, Copperopolis, came out in 1996, so Phillips and drummer Joey Peters drafted keyboardist Jon Brion and former Tonic bassist Dan Rothschild to fill out the lineup on Jubilee. Producer Paul Fox defines a clean, crisp sound for the band, alongside noteworthy guests like Michael Stipe, Robyn Hitchcock and the Wallflowers&#x27; Rami Jaffee . Songs like &quot;Testimony,&quot; continue to evoke an utterly unique world composed of American lore, biblical references, literary flair and stirring emotional honesty. It&#x27;s a singular course he&#x27;s been charting steadily for four albums now.

The single, &quot;Truly, Truly&quot;, received extensive airplay. on American radio

&quot;Jubilee&quot; met with more success than the prior releases thanks to &quot;Truly, Truly.&quot; But, as Phillips describes, a number of changes led to the dissolution of the band&#x27;s time at their label and their time together.

:&quot;The celebrational spirit of Jubilee actually brought a renewed optimism to me personally. The album was well received and understandably the expectations at the label were high, probably too high. Although the highly refined Jubilee had brought the band considerable success at radio with &quot;Truly, Truly,&quot; a shift within the industry was well underway. The label&#x27;s constant nagging about &quot;Call-out Response&quot; was both a new term and a bewildering concept to our ears. The basic strategy: a radio station arranges to call up a listener who is asked to consume about 30 songs over the phone, perhaps 20 seconds of each. From this remote encounter, the listener will then proceed to judge the material. Insufficient call-out response was a big reason that Jubilee hardly got a shot at Warners. Grant Lee Buffalo tunes are often like an old car or an old amp that needs a few seconds to get warmed up, but when it does... look out! Meanwhile, a new crop of young record buyers, the largest since the Baby Boomer era, were now being targeted to the exclusion of Gen-Xers, like myself, still waiting for the Pixies to reform.

In 2001, a compilation of singles, album tracks and rarities called &quot;Storm Hymnal&quot; was released.

==Sound &amp; Vision==

Grant Lee Buffalo&#x27;s sound is comparable to Neil Young and an electrified version of Americana songwriter John Stewart. Phillips writes that their first album &quot;would galvanize the sound of Grant Lee Buffalo, i.e., the acoustic feedback howl of overdriven 12-string guitars, melodic distorto-bass, tribal drum bombast, the old world churn of pump organs and parlor pianos.&quot;

Lyrically, they reference American history as well as contemporary events. For instance, “Lone Star Song” from &quot;Mighty Joe Moon&quot; references the Waco siege and “Crackdown” from &quot;Copperopolis&quot; references the murder of Yoshihiro Hattori as well as the Oklahoma City bombing.

==Live==

GLB toured with major bands including R.E.M., Pearl Jam, the Smashing Pumpkins, and The Cranberries. In the United States, 

In May 2011 the band returned on a limited tour, making stops in Los Angeles, Dublin, London, Brussels, Copenhagen and Oslo. On August 8, 2011, the band performed at Dranouter festival in Belgium, and on August 9 in Copenhagen. The band also played at the German Haldern Pop Festival in August 2012.

==Publication==

In October 2017, Chrysalis Records acquired Grant Lee Buffalo&#x27;s back catalog from Slash Records. Chrysalis/Blue Raincoat CEO Jeremy Lascelles had previously signed the band to the label&#x27;s publisher in the 1990s.

==Solo careers==

Lead singer Phillips has had his own solo career as well. He explains:

:As for Grant Lee Buffalo, I sensed they were beginning to wonder if we&#x27;d ever get through finishing school. Before that could happen, band and label parted as did Peters and myself. The scenery was changing and I was looking for new explorations. I&#x27;m sure we all were. Perhaps we always will be.&quot;

He was signed to the Boston-based indie label Rounder Records and launched a solo career, issuing &quot;Ladies&#x27; Love Oracle&quot; online in 2000. The recording was later more widely released. His first full-length album, &quot;Mobilize&quot;, was released in 2001. Phillips has released eleven albums between 2000 and 2022.

<doc id="968915" wikidata="Q50338" url="?curid=968915" title="Haman County">
<text>Haman County (&quot;Haman-gun&quot;) is a county in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. The local government is seated in the town of Gaya-eup. The county magistrate is Seok Gyu Jin.

In the early Common Era, Haman was the seat of Ara Gaya, a leading state of the Gaya confederacy. Many relics from this period are still preserved in the county. After the fall of Gaya, Haman was absorbed into Silla as Asirang County; in 757, it was renamed to its present moniker Haman.

It borders Changwon to the east and south, Changyeong County to the north and Uiryeong County to the west. It comprises 3.9% of South Gyeongsang Province. Haman stretches 29 km from east to west and 26 km from north to south. It is located roughly in the center of the province. The county is fairly mountainous with Gaya-eup being in the river valley. The highest peak in Haman is Mount Yeohang (770m). There are many tributaries of the Nakdong and Nam rivers in Haman. The Nam serves as the county line between Uiryeong and Haman and the Nakdong as the county line between Haman and Changyeong.

==Transportation==

It is convenient in location being that the Namhae Expressway (Interchange 10) goes through the middle of it. It takes roughly 25 minutes from Haman Intercity Bus Terminal to Masan Intercity Bus Terminal in Hapseong-dong. Buses leave every 30–40 minutes. Uiryeong-gun can also be easily reach by bus from Haman Bus Terminal. However, other surrounding locations are hard to reach by bus from Haman. There are also two train stations that lie within Haman-gun (Gaya-eup and Gunbuk-myeon) making it possible to reach locations such as Suncheon, Jung-ri, Masan, Changwon and Busan by train. However, train schedules in Haman are sporadic making it more convenient to take a bus to Masan and travel onward from there. There are also a number of bike paths throughout Gaya-eup and downward into Haman-myeon. In other areas of the county, bike paths are lacking.

==Economics and Industry==

Haman-gun is an agrarian county. It is particularly famous for the watermelon. There is a watermelon festival held every year in Hamju Park, Gaya-eup in April. It is grown and produced throughout the county in the tributaries of the Nakdong and Namgang rivers. The output per year is 48,217 tons. Some other agricultural products that are grown in Haman are the persimmon, melons, cherry tomatoes, peaches, lotus root, gold melons and grapes. There are a number of factories in Haman-gun with the heaviest concentration being in Chriwon-myeon and Chirseo-myeon.

There is also a market day held every five days in Gaya-eup in the Gaya Market. When the market is open, the farmers from all over the county come to the market to display their fresh produce. There are also many different kinds of vendor that sell meat, fish, snacks and clothes.

==Tourism==

Haman-gun is not known for its tourism industry and visitors from other countries are rare, but the county does have historical sites, temples and mountains to explore. For example, Haman-gun has good places to hike led by Mount Yeohang (770m) in the village of Jueseo-ri in the township of Yeohang-myeon at Yeohangsan Provincial Park in Yeohangsan on secondary Rural Road 1021, which branches off Highway 79. There are four hiking courses originating at different points. Two other peaks are on Mount Bangeo in Gunbuk-myeon and Mount Jakdae in Chriwon-myeon, Ungok-ri.

The Ancient Tomb Complex in Dohang-ri and Malsan-ri in Gaya-eup is another site worth seeing in Haman. It contains around 1,000 tombs in mound form that are supposedly the tombs of kings. The largest royal tomb is Tomb 34 at 39.3m in diameter and 9.7m in height. There is also a museum that accompanies the park. The exhibits are in Korean so admission is free for foreign visitors.

Ipgok County Park in Sanin-myeon, Ipgok-ri is also a particular area of interest in Haman. It can be reached by taking bus 252-2 and 114-1 from any bus stop in Gaya going towards Jung-ri and Masan. It is 4 km from the town center. It is the biggest reservoir in Haman with a circumference of 4 km. There are a number hiking paths and it is frequently visited by local families and fishermen on the weekends. There are also some multiple purpose grounds for soccer and volleyball. It is a nice place to visit in spring to see the azaleas and in the fall to see the changing leaves. Hamju Park in Gaya-eup, Dohang-ri is another place the locals visit for leisure. There is also a stadium there and sports facilities.

==Cultural Events==

There are two festivals in Haman. The first being the Araje Festival which is held on the weekend that April 15 falls. There are a number of cultural and sports events that commemorate the Ara Gaya.

There is also the Watermelon Festival which is also held on a weekend April at Hamju Park in Dohang-ri, Gaya-eup. There are a number of entertainment events, concerts and fireworks. There is also a display of carved watermelons which is quite interesting to see.

==Education==
Educational facilities: 32 schools (elementary 19/middle 8 /high 5), covering 7,830 students. Some of the elementary schools have less than 30 students.

==Administrative divisions==
Haman is divided into 8 &quot;myeon&quot; and 2 &quot;eup&quot;, as follows:

*Chilseo-myeon
*Chirwon-eup
*Daesan-myeon

<doc id="968916" wikidata="Q632232" url="?curid=968916" title="Fort Charlotte, Shetland">
<text>Fort Charlotte in the centre of Lerwick, Shetland, is an artillery fort, roughly five sided, with bastions on each of three landward corners, and half-bastions on the corners of the seaward face.

==History==
The first incarnation of the fort was built between 1652 and 1653 during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Little is known of the original structure and no trace of it has been found.

The second structure was built on the same site by Robert Mylne under the orders of Charles II at the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War in 1665 at a cost of £28,000. It held off a Dutch fleet in 1667 which thought it was far more heavily manned and gunned than it actually was. In fact, the walls were unfinished and there were few guns. At the end of the war it was slighted when the government decided not to station a garrison in Lerwick, and it was unmanned when the Dutch burnt it in 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

It was rebuilt in its current form in 1781 and named after Queen Charlotte, but has never seen service during hostilities since then. It housed a garrison during the Napoleonic Wars and was later a base for the Royal Naval Reserve. From 1837 to 1875 it was used as the town jail and courthouse and later a custom house and a coastguard station.

Due to land reclamation and subsequently erected docks and buildings in front of the fort, it no longer dominates the shoreline and buildings in close proximity means the overall shape can only be seen from the air.

==Modern use==
Today Fort Charlotte is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, and is the base for Shetland&#x27;s Army Reserves.

<text>SN 2004dj was the brightest supernova since SN 1987A at the time of its discovery.

This Type II-P supernova was discovered by Japanese astronomer Kōichi Itagaki on 31 July 2004. At the time of its discovery, its apparent brightness was 11.2 visual magnitude; the discovery occurred after the supernova had reached its peak magnitude. The supernova&#x27;s progenitor is a star in a young, compact star cluster in the galaxy NGC 2403, in Camelopardalis. The cluster had been cataloged as the 96th object in a list of luminous stars and clusters by Allan Sandage in 1984; the progenitor is therefore commonly referred to as Sandage 96. This cluster is easily visible in a Kitt Peak National Observatory image and appears starlike.

<text>Shetland Islands Broadcasting Company (SIBC) is the only Independent Local Radio station broadcasting in the Shetland Islands. Its coverage extends across the whole of Shetland. The station, which is owned and operated by husband and wife team, Ian Anderson and Inga Walterson, is located at Market Street, Lerwick and broadcasts from Bressay on 96.2 MHz FM.

==History==
The company, which was registered on 23 September 1985, began broadcasting on 26 November 1987, initially as an unlicensed pirate radio station covering the immediate area around Lerwick, after the operator was told by regulators of the era that the population of Shetland was too small to support an independent local radio station.

SIBC was later granted an official licence in 1991, extending its coverage to the whole of the Shetland Islands. It is currently on a 12-year commercial radio licence from broadcasting regulator Ofcom.

Ian Anderson, one of the station&#x27;s two owners, was previously a broadcaster for the BBC and Radio Forth, as well as pirate radio stations including Radio Atlantis, Radio Northsea International, and Radio Caroline.

==Programming==
SIBC is on the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with a schedule of contemporary hit music and local news (on the hour and at 0730, 0830 and 1730), which at times includes news of Shetland fish landings. The station also carries, as necessary, essential information regarding emergencies, school closures, etc. Programming is largely automated outside of the breakfast slot. Music by local Shetland artists forms a part of SIBC&#x27;s playlist.

The station is unusual in that it carries very few DJ-led programmes, most hours are filled with back-to-back music, and all programmes and news bulletins aired on the station are presented by either Ian Anderson or Inga Walterson. Its format has remained unchanged since launch, with only the music being updated to reflect current hits. 

== Transmission ==
SIBC transmits its main signal on 96.2 MHz from a transmitter on the island of Bressay with an effective radiated power of 14kW. The station has an additional transmitter facility situated at its Lerwick premises, broadcasting with 25 watts on 102.2 MHz, as an emergency back-up facility to provide coverage to Lerwick in the event of issues at Bressay.

<text>The Nissan Fuga (Japanese: 日産・フーガ &quot;Nissan Fūga&quot;) is a mid-size luxury sedan produced by Japanese automaker Nissan since October 2004. It is built on a wider, stretched wheelbase version of the Nissan FM platform. After the Nissan Cima and Nissan President were discontinued in August 2010, the Fuga became Nissan&#x27;s flagship vehicle. In North America and Europe, the Fuga was sold as the second and third-generation Infiniti M and Infiniti Q70, where it was the flagship sedan of the Infiniti luxury division of Nissan from 2006 to 2019.

First shown as the Fuga Concept at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, the F51 replaced the long-running Nissan Cedric, Gloria, Cima and President. The name derives from the Italian &quot;fuga&quot;, for fugue, the musical composition form.

== First generation (Y50; 2004)==

When the Prince (Nissan) Gloria was first introduced in 1959, it was based on a stretched version of the original Prince Skyline, which was first introduced in 1957. Nissan used this approach again for the Fuga, using the Skyline platform again. The Fuga was available at Japanese Nissan dealerships called &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot; and &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; until &quot;Blue Stage&quot; and &quot;Red Stage&quot; dealerships were combined into one Japanese Nissan dealership network utilized internationally in 2005.

Nissan wanted to create a fresh approach started by the Cedric/Gloria and focus its efforts to compete with European executive mid-sized sports sedans, such as the BMW 5 series, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E-Class and Jaguar S-Type. The Fuga&#x27;s primary competitor is the Toyota Crown Athlete Series, but also competes with the Lexus GS, as well as Honda Legend.

The Fuga trim levels began with &quot;XV&quot; and ended with &quot;GT&quot; as the top trim package, equivalent to the previous &quot;Brougham&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; versions of the Cedric and Gloria.

In markets outside Japan it is sold as the second-generation Infiniti M (M35/45). The Infiniti M became the flagship of the Infiniti luxury division after the 2006 model year, as the Infiniti Q (the Cima&#x27;s counterpart in certain markets) was discontinued. However the Cima would remain in production for the Japanese domestic market and it is longer than the Fuga which slots below it in the lineup.

The Fuga is also used as an uplevel taxi in Japan.

Mitsuoka Motors, a small Japanese automobile company, uses the Nissan Fuga as a base for their Galue-III luxury sedan which has been produced since 2005.

===Equipment===
Aluminium is used in the body, hood, trunk lid and door internal structure to reduce weight. The front suspension uses a double wishbone setup, also to reduce unsprung weight, and to improve vehicle handling. This type of suspension was previously used on the Cedric/Gloria until 1983, when that platform began to use MacPherson struts for the front suspension, but still uses the multilink rear suspension which was introduced on the Cedric/Gloria in 1979. The Fuga uses aluminum alloy extensively in both the front and rear suspension components.

The GT sports package includes Nissan&#x27;s 4WS version of HICAS to improve stability and handling, taking advantage of the 53:47 weight distribution.

A driver aid system used in Japan, called Distance Control Assistance, pushes the gas pedal against the foot when the DVD navigation with GPS determines that an unsafe speed is being maintained. If the Autonomous cruise control system is being used, the Distance Control Assistance will reduce speed automatically, and will warn the driver that an adjustment is being made with an audible bell sound.

===Marketing===
When the Fuga was first introduced for sale October 14, 2004 the advertising campaign used a musical work in the fugue style. The work is titled &quot;Vortex&quot;, composed and arranged by Akihiko Matsumoto, and was specially commissioned for Nissan. The music was played in three movements by a full orchestra for 7 minutes and 42 seconds, and a recording was given to dealers in Japan as a promotional DVD-CD gift for customers called &quot;Fuga The Movie and Premium Soundtrack&quot;, free of charge.

The DVD and CD package was not available for private sale, with the DVD providing a gallery of images, and descriptions of key technologies such as how the adaptive cruise control functions, various safety technologies like the Blind Spot camera, which is a camera installed on the passenger side side view mirror displaying a view of the curb on the in-dash monitor, and a movie with the Fuga on a mountain road, using the &quot;Vortex&quot; soundtrack. The DVD is recorded in Dolby 5.1 surround sound.

== Second generation (Y51; 2009)==
The second generation Nissan Fuga, introduced as the Infiniti M, was previewed at the 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance. The new Fuga debuted at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show. The production version went on sale across Japan starting on December 21, 2009. It is sold in overseas markets under the Infiniti nameplate as the third-generation M (M37/M56/35h/30d). The second generation Fuga&#x27;s body design (styled by Hideo Komuro in 2007), took on a more organic look. and was a resurrection of a 1960s and 1970s appearance called &quot;coke bottle styling&quot; that was used on the 1970s Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria.

The Y51 series Infiniti M / Nissan Fuga introduced November 2009 is only shorter than the F50 series Nissan Cima, with the same width dimensions of and height of compared to the Cima&#x27;s of height. In August 2010, the Fuga became Nissan&#x27;s flagship with the announcement of the cancellation of the Nissan Cima and the Nissan President. The Fuga is shorter than the Nissan President, and the Fuga has a longer wheelbase at , compared to the wheelbase on the President and Cima at . When the Fuga assumed the role as flagship sedan of Nissan Japan August 2010, it became the first time that Nissan didn&#x27;t sell a premium luxury V8 sedan in Japan; the Fuga&#x27;s North American cousin, the Infiniti M56, is offered with a V8 shared with the Infiniti QX56.

World first Wrong-way driving warning debuted on the Fuga hybrid in 2010.

The VK45DE V8 engine used in the previous generation is no longer offered in Japan, neither is the succeeding VK56VD V8 which is only found on the Fuga&#x27;s North American counterpart, the Infiniti M56. The larger 5.6L engine incurs a higher rate of road tax liability which hampers sales. The VQ35HR 3.5 L V6 Hybrid is now the Fuga&#x27;s third engine option, utilizing the Atkinson cycle. The electric motor, installed in parallel between the engine and the transmission, produces from 1.3kWh lithium-ion batteries that are expected to have a service life of 10 years. The batteries are installed upright behind the rear seats. The Fuga Hybrid introduced Nissan&#x27;s first in-house developed electric hybrid technology, and Nissan claims it will double the fuel economy of its gasoline-powered version.

A driving mode selector knob has been installed as standard equipment on all models, situated below the transmission gear lever and between the heated and ventilated front seat controls, providing four selections labeled &quot;Standard&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Eco&quot;, and &quot;Snow&quot;, allowing the 7-speed transmission, engine and various systems to optimize driving based on varying conditions. To minimize exhaust noise intrusion into the passenger compartment from the engine at low RPMs, &quot;Active Noise Control&quot; has been installed. Double-piston shock absorbers, developed by Kayaba Industry Company, have replaced the ones previously supplied by Hitachi.

Trim levels offered in Japan start with the 250GT, 250GT Type P, 250GT &quot;A&quot; package; 370GT, 370GT FOUR (AWD), 370GT FOUR (AWD) &quot;A&quot; package, 370GT Type S, with the 370VIP at the top of the range. The 370GT Type S uses 20&quot; Bridgestone Potenza RE050A 245/40 tires, with other trim packages using Dunlop SP Sport Maxx TT 245/50 tires on 18&quot; with all wheels consisting of aluminum alloy.

Some of the optional interior equipment includes heated and ventilated front seats, a 16 speaker Bose &quot;studio surround&quot; audio system, power reclining rear seats, power ottoman for the rear passenger opposite the driver, and HDD navigation combined with a telematics subscription service called &quot;CarWings&quot; in Japan.

Safety technology has also been introduced, such as Lane Departure Prevention, which uses a small camera mounted above the rearview mirror to gauge distance from the lane markers, and will lightly tap selected brakes when necessary to help ease the car back into the correct lane. It will allow for unimpeded lane changes when the turn signal is used, and will yield control to the driver at all times.

Blind Spot Intervention System uses sensors to provide a visual warning in the side view mirror. If the car senses that movement towards the obstacle is occurring, it will provide an audible warning and will apply opposite side brakes to guide the vehicle into the correct lane.

The Nissan Fuga Hybrid, together with the Nissan Leaf, will include Nissan&#x27;s new Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians system to alert pedestrians, the blind and others to their presence when the hybrid is operating at low speeds in all-electric mode.

In 2022, Nissan ended production of the Fuga, as well as the Cima, with no plans for a successor for either model.

<text>Hamyang County (&quot;Hamyang-gun&quot;) is a county in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

It is home to the Wooden Seated Statue of Buddha in Beopinsa (법인사), the Standing Statue of Buddha in Deokjeonri (덕전리), the Three-Level Stone Pagoda, Stone Seated Statue of Buddha, Three Storied Stone Pagoda of Seungansa (승안사) Temple Site. There are also historical sites such as the Namgyeseowon (남계서원) Confucian School, Hwangseoksanseong (황석산성) Fortress, and Sageunsanseong (사근산성) Fortress.

== History ==

=== Three Kingdoms Period ===
The Sageunsanseong Fortress, which encircles the peak of Yeonhwasan Mountain (443 m above sea level) is presumed to have been built during the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BCE-668 CE) and used until the Joseon period (1392-1910). The fortress was located at a strategic pass and was therefore a site of fierce conflicts between the Baekje Kingdom (18 BCE-660 CE) to the west and the Silla Kingdom (57 BCE-935 CE) to the east. The fortress also played a very important role in guarding against Japanese pirates who invaded from the southern coast in an attempt to reach the fertile lands of the Jeolla region.

According to historical sources, it is said that when the Japanese invaded this area in 1380, around 500 people died here in battle. The fortress was neglected for centuries until it was repaired in the late 15th century.

The fortress wall measures about 1.2 km in circumference and about 5 m in height. The walls are made of rectangular stones and were built using a technique typical of the 7th century. Inside the fortress, various remains were excavated, including building and gate sites and a stone pond, as well as artifacts from the Baekje and Silla Kingdoms.

=== The Unified Shilla period ===
Hamyang-gun was called Sokham-gun or Hamsung during the Unified Shilla era. In 757 AD in the 16th year of King Gyeongdeok of Silla, the name was changed to Cheonryung-gun. Under King Gyeongduk&#x27;s reign, it was called Yeosun and placed under Geochang-gun.

=== Joseon Dynasty ===
In 1552, the Namgyeseowon Confucian Academy was built during the 7th year of the reign of Myeongjong of Joseon) in memory of Jeong Yeo-chang&#x27;s academic accomplishments.

In mid-August 1597, in the early stage of the Jeongyujae crisis, there was an invasion of Japanese troops against the Hwangseoksan Fortress. The battle was fought between local citizens in Hamyang and Aneum Geochang of Joseon and Katō Kiyomasa of the Japanese military, with over 60,000 troops. The Hwangseoksanseong Fortress was guarded by Gwak Jun, the governor of Aneumhyeon, as the chief commander, Baek Sa-rim of Gimhae Busa as the supreme commander, and Jo Jo-do, the former governor of Hamyang. The battle started on August 16 and the Joseon army was completely annihilated on the 18th, but Baeksarim of Gimhae Bussa. 353 Koreans were killed inside the fortress.

<text>Ruthven Barracks (), near Ruthven in Badenoch, Scotland, are the best preserved of the four barracks built in 1719 after the 1715 Jacobite rising. Set on an old castle mound, the complex comprises two large three-storey blocks occupying two sides of the enclosure, each with two rooms per floor. The barracks and enclosing walls were built with loopholes for musket firing, and bastion towers were built at opposite corners. Destroyed by Jacobites following their retreat after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Barracks ruins are maintained as a scheduled monument by Historic Environment Scotland. They are accessible at all times without entrance charge.

==History==
===First and second castles===
The first castle (fortified structure) was built on the hilltop site in 1229, possibly by the Comyns. During the 13th century the castle was held by the Lords of Badenoch, chiefs of Clan Comyn. It was used as a base by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan who was known as the &quot;Wolf of Badenoch&quot;, the younger son of King Robert II of Scotland. The first castle at Ruthven was demolished in 1451 by John of Islay, Earl of Ross. It was replaced with a second castle, completed in 1459.

From the 15th to 16th century, the castle was held by the Earls of Huntly, chiefs of Clan Gordon, who were then the feudal superiors and lords of Badenoch. The castle was contested during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and later John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, attacked the castle and severely damaged it during the Jacobite rising of 1689.

===Jacobite risings===

Due to continued unrest, the British government decided to build fortified barracks in strategic locations: the new barracks at Ruthven were completed in 1721 on the castle hilltop. The barracks accommodated 120 troops and 28 horses for dragoons. In August 1745, a unit of 12 soldiers, commanded by a Sergeant Terrence Molloy of the 6th Regiment of Foot, defended the barracks against 200 Jacobites, losing one man killed, whilst killing at least two Jacobites and wounding many more. The following year Molloy, still in command of the barracks and promoted to the rank of lieutenant, surrendered to a larger force of Jacobites, with two cannons, commanded by John Gordon of Glenbucket.

On the day after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, some 3,000 Jacobites retreated to Fort Ruthven but they were sent home by Prince Charles Edward Stuart as their situation was hopeless. The Jacobite army and their leaders had regrouped at Ruthven Barracks where they had waited for word from Charles. His message for them arrived on 20 April, in which he stated &quot;let every man seek his own safety in the best way he can&quot;. The departing Jacobites destroyed the barracks on 17 April 1746. The ruins remain.

<doc id="968940" wikidata="Q7679254" url="?curid=968940" title="Tales from Ovid">
<text>Tales from Ovid is a poetical work written by the English poet Ted Hughes, published in 1997 by Faber and Faber. The book is a retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. It won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for 1997 and has been translated into several languages. It was one of his last published works, along with &quot;Birthday Letters&quot;. Four of the tales had been previously published in 1995, in &quot;After Ovid, New Metamorphoses&quot;, edited by M. Hofmann and J. Ladun.

A stage adaptation was performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company in the autumn of 1999 at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. The Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble has also performed dramatisations of excerpts from Hughes&#x27; book, between 2006 and 2008.

In 2009, Fiona Shaw performed one of these tales, Echo and Narcissus, in the context of a Prologue to Henry Purcell&#x27;s opera &quot;Dido and Aeneas,&quot; with Les Arts Florissants, directed by French conductor and harpsichordist William Christie.

Professor James Shapiro, writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, said of the book: &quot;Hughes makes clear his admiration for the gift that Shakespeare shares with Ovid: insight into what a passion feels like to one possessed by it. Not just ordinary passion either, but human passion in extremis -- passion where it combusts, or levitates, or mutates into an experience of the supernatural. Hughes, too, is blessed with this gift, and this book brilliantly succeeds at bringing Ovid&#x27;s passionate and disturbing stories to life.&quot;

<doc id="968946" wikidata="Q5295373" url="?curid=968946" title="Donaldson v Becket">
<text>Donaldson v Becket (1774) 2 Brown&#x27;s Parl. Cases (2d ed.) 129, 1 Eng. Rep. 837; 4 Burr. 2408, 98 Eng. Rep. 257; 17 Cobbett&#x27;s Parl. Hist. 953 is the ruling by the British House of Lords that held that copyright in published works was not perpetual but was subject to statutory limits. Some scholars disagree on the reasoning behind the decision.

==Name==

The spelling of the chief respondent in the case, Thomas Becket, sometimes appears as Beckett. For those looking to choose one spelling over the other, it would be more correct to use Becket. Firstly, Becket overwhelmingly spelled his surname &quot;t&quot;, not &quot;tt&quot;. Secondly, many of the original contemporaneous records in the case also spelled his surname &quot;Becket&quot;. Those records include the original proceedings of the dispute in the Court of Chancery. Additionally, the manuscript records of the appeal in the House of Lords, including the manuscript minutes and manuscript journal of the House of Lords, caption the case using the spelling &quot;Becket&quot;, but sometimes in the text of the proceedings used the spelling &quot;Beckett&quot;. The earliest reports of the case, those prepared by James Burrow in 1776 and Josiah Brown (1st edition) in 1783, also spelled his surname Becket. The &quot;Beckett&quot; variation seems to have gained ground from a decision made in 1803 by T. E. Tomlins, the editor of the second edition of Brown&#x27;s report of the case, to change the spelling to &quot;Beckett&quot; in the caption and then to a decision made by the clerk of the journals in the House of Lords, when the House printed its manuscript journal in around 1806, to do the same.

==Facts==
The first recognizably modern copyright statute was the Statute of Anne (8 Ann. c. 21) (1710), in which Parliament granted a fourteen-year term for a copyright, extendable once for another 14 years if the author was still alive at the expiration of the first term. Parliament also provided a special grandfather clause allowing those works already published before the statute to enjoy twenty-one years of protection. When the twenty-one years were up, the booksellers—for copyrights in published works were usually held and exploited by publishers and booksellers—asked for an extension. Parliament declined to grant it.

Thwarted by Parliament, the booksellers turned to the courts for relief. They attempted to secure a ruling that there was a natural or customary right to ownership of the copyright under the common law. The booksellers arranged a collusive lawsuit, &quot;Tonson v Collins&quot;, but the courts threw it out. A second lawsuit was later brought, &quot;Millar v Taylor&quot; 4 Burr. 2303, 98 Eng. Rep. 201 (K.B. 1769), concerning infringement of the copyright on James Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot; by Robert Taylor, and the booksellers won a favourable 3-1 judgment. (Lord Mansfield, the chief judge on the case, had previously been counsel to the copyright-holding booksellers in various suits filed in the Court of Chancery in the 1730s. Justice Yates, the dissenting judge in &quot;Millar v. Taylor&quot;, had himself previously been counsel to the challengers of common-law copyright in &quot;Tonson v. Collins&quot;.)

&quot;Donaldson v Becket&quot; was brought regarding the same poem at issue in &quot;Millar&quot; and an injunction was granted by the Court of Chancery on the precedent of &quot;Millar v. Taylor&quot;. An appeal from the Chancery decree was carried to the House of Lords, which at that time functioned as the United Kingdom&#x27;s court of final appeal, in February 1774.

==Proceedings==

===Argument===
Counsel was heard on 4, 7–9 February.

Seven months previously, in the case of &quot;Hinton v Donaldson&quot;, the Scots Court of Session had ruled that copyright did not exist in the common law of Scotland, so that Alexander Donaldson (an appellant in &quot;Donaldson v. Becket&quot; with his elder brother, John) could lawfully publish Thomas Stackhouse&#x27;s &quot;New History of the Holy Bible&quot;. Attorney General Thurlow, speaking for the appellants, referred to the Scottish case in his opening argument to the Lords on 4 February: 

===Questions===
The practice of the House of Lords at the time when considering a challenging case was to ask the twelve judges of the King&#x27;s Bench, Common Pleas, and the Exchequer for their expert views on particular issues identified, for the consideration of the House. This would then be followed by a debate, and then a vote of the full house.

On 9 February, Lord Apsley, the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, formulated three questions for the judges:

At the instigation of Lord Camden, two further questions were also put:

While the first questions were couched in terms of the rights of the authors, Lord Camden&#x27;s emphasised the other side of the coin, the issue of a perpetual monopoly.

=== Answers ===
The judges presented their views in the period from 15 to 21 February.

According to the journal of the House of Lords, the balance of their opinions were:
:* Eight answers to three, &quot;supporting&quot; authors&#x27; right of first publication at common law and right of action against publication without consent
:* Seven answers to four, &quot;against&quot; the authors&#x27; rights at common law being taken away by first publication
:* Six answers to five, &quot;supporting&quot; that authors&#x27; rights at common law in published works &quot;were&quot; superseded by the statute
:* Seven answers to four, &quot;supporting&quot; that, at common law, authors had sole right of publication, in perpetuity
:* Six answers to five, &quot;supporting&quot; that this right was circumscribed by the statute

For a time in the late 20th century, some scholars believed that the tally in the journal for the crucial third question was incorrect, and that a majority of the judges had opined that a common-law copyright was &quot;not&quot; &quot;taken away&quot; by the statute; but that their views had been rejected by the full House of Lords. However those scholars now appear to acknowledge, in light of a review of a wider range of documents, that the journal reported the positions of the judges correctly, as did law reports based on it; and that it was the reporting of the view of Justice George Nares in various works based ultimately on an account by William Woodfall in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; that was incorrect.

The balance of opinions on the first question has sometimes traditionally been represented as ten-to-one; however according to the tallies while both Barons Perrott and Adams accepted that an author should have the sole right of printing or publishing a book or literary composition, they rejected the second half of the proposition, advising that an author should only be able to bring an action against someone who printed, published or sold it if they had obtained the copy by fraud or violence. A report in &quot;Hansard&quot; of Perrott&#x27;s detailed reasons he makes clear that in his view the author&#x27;s right at common law extended only to the physical copy, not to the content within it. Furthermore, while the Lord Chief Justice Lord de Grey answered the first question affirmatively, his detailed answer made clear that his position on this related only to the physical manuscript; his views on rights to &quot;more than the materials or the manuscript&quot; were the province of the second question (in which he opined that author&#x27;s right at common law was indeed extinguished by first publication). Arguably a true statement of the judges&#x27; positions on whether authors had a natural copyright at common law would therefore be seven to four.

A twelfth judge who was entitled to state and give reasons for his answers was Lord Mansfield. Presumably his views still conformed to his original judgment, in &quot;Millar v Taylor&quot;. But – to the frustration of some – he did not speak.

=== Debate and vote ===
On 22 February the motion was made to reverse the Chancery decree. The Lords then debated, the record showing that five Lords spoke. Four of these, Lord Camden, Lord Chancellor Apsley, the Bishop of Carlisle, and the Earl of Effingham, spoke in favour of the motion to reverse the decree, and one, Lord Lyttleton, spoke against the motion.

Lord Camden, in his speech, was scathing toward the booksellers: 

In the end, the full House voted to reverse the decree against Donaldson. Thus the House of Lords rejected perpetual copyright in published works and held that they were subject to the durational limits of the Statute of Anne. As a result, published works would fall into the public domain after their copyright terms expired.

It had been thought, for many years, that the House of Lords voted by division. But research has demonstrated that the vote in the case was taken by a collective voice vote, and thus without knowing how many Lords voted, their names, or how they each voted.

==Significance==
Robert Forbes, Bishop of Ross and Caithness, noted in his journal entry of 26 February 1774, that when news of the Lords&#x27; decision in &quot;Donaldson v. Becket&quot; reached Scotland, there were 
Later that year, UK booksellers sought to extend their statutory copyright to 14 years through the Booksellers&#x27; Bill but, having passed the House of Commons, the bill was defeated in the Lords. 
In 1834, the United States Supreme Court also rejected perpetual copyright in &quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot;.

===Common-law copyright===
The significance of the decision for the doctrine of common-law copyright was (and is) less clear.

As a matter of strict judicial precedent, the court had merely established that once a work was published it was governed solely by the durational terms of the Statute of Anne. This was how the holding was stated by Justice Blackstone, one of the judges whose view had been in favour of perpetual copyright, in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot; (7th edition, 1775). It is also the general view of scholars of the case today. This notably was also the view of the case taken by the judges and Law Lords who spoke on the issue in &quot;Jefferys v. Boosey&quot;, 4 H.L.C. 815, 872, 961 (H.L. 1854). Referring to &quot;Donaldson&quot;, Lord Brougham stated that &quot;upon the general question of literary property at common law no judgment whatever was pronounced.&quot;

Nevertheless, it became common for observers in the late eighteenth century and beyond to read &quot;Donaldson&quot;, sometimes in combination with &quot;Millar&quot;, as persuasive authority predominating in favor of an antecedent common-law right in literary works, both before and after first publication. This viewpoint probably stemmed from the fact that a majority of the judges who had advised the House on the issue—and even a majority of the judges and speaking Lords combined who had advised the House and who spoke on the antecedent right—opined or allowed that an antecedent right did exist.

In recent times, two scholars have argued that the House affirmatively &quot;rejected&quot; the notion that a common law copyright existed before the Statute of Anne, though it appears that only one of them continues to advocate this view. Scholars have criticized the sole holdout—who conceded in his principal article on the subject to being &quot;unfamiliar[] with the nuances of 18th century English parliamentary procedure&quot;—for relying on anachronistic arguments.

<doc id="968948" wikidata="Q1662408" url="?curid=968948" title="Infiniti M">
<text>The Infiniti M is a line of mid-size luxury (executive) cars from the Infiniti luxury division of Nissan. From 2013 (model year 2014) on it has been marketed as the Infiniti Q70, reflecting the company&#x27;s new naming scheme.

The first iteration was the M30 Coupé/Convertible, which were rebadged JDM Nissan Leopard. After a long hiatus, the M nameplate was used for Infiniti&#x27;s mid-luxury sedans (executive cars). First was the short-lived M45 sedan, a rebadged version of the Japanese-spec Nissan Gloria. The next generations, the M35/45 and M37/56/35h/30d, became the flagship of the Infiniti brand and are based on the JDM Nissan Fuga.


== First generation (1989–1992) ==

The Infiniti M30 was a 2-door coupé based on the Japanese market Nissan Leopard (chassis code F31). It was launched in 1989 for the 1990 model year as a lower-priced alternative to the Infiniti Q45, and was intended to be an alternative to the Acura Legend coupe and to a lesser extent the Lexus ES 250, as it was also a lower-priced alternative to the Lexus LS400, although the ES 250 was only offered as a 4-door sedan.

Unlike its competitors that were designed with the American market in mind and were launched as brand-new models, the M30 was based on a somewhat dated platform that was originally designed for the Japanese market; when the Leopard was imported to the United States, few changes were made to the exterior but the interior was revised to better suit American tastes; a leather interior was standard in the M30, and several features in the Leopard such as a center-mounted television screen and a digital instrument cluster weren&#x27;t available in the M30 as those features were perceived as gimmicks in western car markets.

The M30&#x27;s angular design aesthetics and on-road performance were viewed as outdated, especially considering a redesigned Acura Legend coupe was launched in 1991. The interior came in for criticism for its outdated ergonomics and lack of room. While the Japanese-market Leopard had received a new dashboard along with the 1988 facelift, economics precluded making a left-hand-drive version of the new dashboard and the M30 was instead fitted with the LHD version of the R31 Skyline&#x27;s rectilinear dashboard, first presented in 1985.

The M30 made up for these deficiencies in its somewhat lower price; whereas the 1990 Acura Legend coupe started at $27,325 before options and the 1990 BMW 325i started at $24,650 before options, the M30 started at $23,500, and had no factory options, per Infiniti&#x27;s pricing structure used at the time. Dealerships offered an in-car cellular telephone and in-dash CD player as optional accessories, amongst other items.

===Overview===
Standard equipment on the M30 included a driver&#x27;s side airbag, anti-lock brakes, an anti-theft security system with an engine immobilizer, Nissan Sonar Suspension II, and leather upholstery. Other standard features include a 4 speaker Nissan-Bose audio system with satellite radio controls, a cassette player and an electric mast antenna, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power mirrors, power moonroof, and on coupes, automatic climate control.

For the 1991 model year, the cable-type speedometer became electric, instrument cluster typeface changed to match that of the Q45, and fuel and coolant temperature gauges were switched. An illuminated entry feature was added that would light the driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s door keyhole and the interior dome light upon pulling the outer door handle. Selective door lock logic was added that allowed unlocking of the passenger door from the driver&#x27;s keyhole by turning the key twice. 

A convertible was introduced for the 1991 model year. All convertibles originated as coupe models, and were shipped to California and converted by American Sunroof Corporation (ASC). The electric canvas top featured fully automatic push-button operation, similar to the redesigned 1990 Mercedes-Benz SL, although the SL used a hydraulic system. Unlike the coupe, the M30 convertible use manual climate controls, and a Bose &quot;Active Sound&quot; audio system. The convertible top used a plastic rear window; as a result the rear window defroster feature used on the coupe was removed, and buttons to raise and lower the convertible top were put in place of the rear window defroster switch. The convertible model was never officially sold in Japan, and was exclusive to the US market, although convertibles have been imported to Japan in the last few years by collectors.

All 1992 models gained the addition of a central locking switch next to the Sonar Suspension II selector, and the intake plenum cover was revised and displayed the Infiniti logo, rather than the Nissan logo and the &quot;V6 3000&quot; script on 1990 and 1991 cars.

The M30 was discontinued after the 1992 model year following a production run of approximately 17,000 cars. It was replaced in the Infiniti lineup by the J30 sedan, which was based on the F31 Nissan Leopard&#x27;s successor, the Nissan Leopard J. Ferie (chassis code Y32).

=== Technical ===
Power came from Nissan&#x27;s VG30E V6, which produced at 6000 rpm, and of torque at 3500 rpm. All M30s had a Jatco RE4R01A 4-speed automatic transmission. The differential was a Nissan open R200 unit. Although most Nissan Leopards were equipped with a DOHC V6, offered in 2-liter, 3-liter, naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants, the M30 was only offered with the SOHC VG30E. Although it was a smooth powertrain, which Infiniti touted in its brochures for the M30, the coupe, and 3,523 lb (1,598 kg) convertible were generally received as overweight and underpowered, with a quoted 0–60 time of 9.4 and 9.7 seconds, respectively. Infiniti marketed the car as a luxury sports coupe, but its relatively low power output, comfort-oriented driving dynamics, and the absence of a manual transmission hampered its performance and sporting image.

Like the Nissan Maxima, the M30 was equipped with Nissan&#x27;s Sonar Suspension II. A sonar sensor mounted underneath the front bumper scanned the road surface ahead of the vehicle and instantly changed damping based on varying road surfaces, using individual actuators on all shock absorbers. A center console-mounted switch allowed drivers to choose between Comfort (soft) and Sport (firm) suspension modes. All M30s used McPherson struts for the front wheels, and a semi-trailing arm rear suspension with coil springs for the rear.

== Second generation (2002–2004) ==
Infiniti M45 was designed in 2000 at the Nissan Technical Center (NTC) in Atsugi, Japan; was manufactured in Tochigi, Japan; and is based on eleventh generation, Y34-series Nissan Gloria. In contrast to the Japanese models, which were available only with 6-cylinder engines, the M45 was powered by Nissan&#x27;s VK45DE V8, producing and of torque, which it shared with the Infiniti&#x27;s flagship Q45.

In addition to the difference in powertrain with the Y34 Cedric/Gloria, the Y34 M45 uses a different instrument panel design, similar to the F50 Q45 as well as a different rear multi-link suspension design. The Y34 Cedric/Gloria&#x27;s rear multi-link suspension design is similar to the Nissan Z32 300ZX, and Nissan S14/S15 Silvia/200SX/240SX where the rear spring is mounted on the strut. The rear suspension design on the Y34 M45 is much like the rear suspension design on the Nissan Z33 350Z, where the spring is mounted independent of the shock/strut, and sits directly on the lower arm, in a spring cup.

The front suspension design carries over from the Y33 Q45, with a one-piece strut/upright. In place of the stamped steel front lower arm, the Y34 M45 has a cast aluminum lower A-arm.
The M45 broadened Nissan&#x27;s use of the 4.5L V8 that had been exclusive to the Q45, allowing the company to better amortize the engine&#x27;s development cost.

== Third generation (2005–2010)==
Infiniti released a redesigned M for the 2006 model year, released in February 2005, and marketed in Japan as the Nissan Fuga. All-wheel-drive models, marketed as the M35x and M45x, use a system (ATTESA-ETS) to send all power to the rear wheels until slip is detected. As the Q45 was no longer exported from Japan after model year 2006, the M45 became Infiniti&#x27;s flagship.

The M used a more rigid version of the Nissan FM platform shared with the G35/350Z/FX — and was available with the VQ-series 3.5 L V6 in the M35, or the Q45&#x27;s 4.5 L V8 in the M45. 

While shorter than the last Q45 at , the M offered greater interior space, performance, a rear multilink suspension and front double wishbone, and improved ergonomics as well as a longer wheelbase. 

===Reception===
The automotive press the Y50 Infiniti M several praised the M35 and M45&#x27;s driving involvement and handling dynamics vs the GS and E-Class while having superior ergonomics to the 5 Series; furthermore the M was equipped and priced competitively against its German rivals, while the M35 also received strong reviews. Despite entering a very crowded, competitive segment in which almost every member has been recently redesigned, the M managed to claim several key distinctions. The M is near or at the top of its class of every interior dimension, actually breaking into the United States Environmental Protection Agency &quot;large&quot; category depending on which option packages are selected. The M35x won &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; top luxury car pick for 2006, taking the top spot from the 2005 Lexus LS 430.

The Infiniti M did not gain a significant share in the mid-luxury market. The Infiniti G37 sedan and coupe, competing in the entry-level luxury sport category, accounted for half of the marque&#x27;s sales as of 2009. Out of that year&#x27;s 81000 Infiniti cars sold, only 10000 were of the M nameplate. Furthermore, the 2009 update left M35 and M45 in awkward positions of the Infiniti lineup, as though they were the flagships of the marque, they were out-powered by the VQ37VHR engines fitted in the 2009 G37 coupe and sedan. For that model year while the G Series received 7-speed automatic transmissions across the lineup, only the M35 RWD was upgraded to a 7-speed automatic while the rest of the nameplate retained the aging 5-speed automatic.

===2008/2009 Mid-generational refresh===

For the 2008 model year, the Infiniti M received a facelift, receiving optional all wheel drive (M45x), revised front and rear fascias, revised tail lights, and redesigned blue-highlighted gauges, previously orange. Infiniti also offered an S type version for the M45/M45x similar to the previous Sport model. Other new features on the 2008 model include touch screen hard drive based navigation, iPod integration, and a music hard drive.

For 2009, the M35 received a new V6 engine producing and of torque and a 7-speed automatic transmission. The 2009 M35x, M45, and M45x retained the five-speed automatic.

== Fourth generation (2010–2019) ==


The Y51, designed by Hideo Komuro during 2006 and 2008 under the supervision of Shiro Nakamura, took on a more fluid look, recalling the coke bottle styling of a 1960s and 1970s.

The 2011 Infiniti M debuted at the 59th Annual Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance, and at a media event in Beverly Hills, California in December 2009, to coincide with the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles. The production version went on sale globally starting in the spring of 2010, as a 2011 model — and in the US on March 1, 2010. It was launched in Europe at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show.

A driving mode selector was included on all models, situated below the transmission gear lever and between the heated and ventilated front seat controls, providing four selections labeled &quot;Standard&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot;, &quot;Eco&quot;, and &quot;Snow&quot;, allowing the 7-speed transmission, engine and various systems to optimize driving in varying conditions. To minimize intrusion of exhaust noise in the passenger compartment, the M included a noise cancelling system marketed as &quot;Active Noise Control&quot;. Double-piston shock absorbers, developed by Kayaba Industry Company, have replaced those previously supplied by Hitachi.

The 5.6L V8 VK56VD in the Infiniti M56 was competitive with other V8 mid-luxury (executive) cars such as the BMW 550i and Mercedes-Benz E550. The 5.6L V8 is not shared with its Japanese domestic market counterpart, the Nissan Fuga, as Nissan opted instead to have the hybrid version as the performance option. The extended length version of the Fuga, known as the Cima, is offered as the Infiniti Q70L beginning from model year 2015.

The M37 and M56 will have all-wheel drive optional, badged as M37x and M56x, respectively.

Safety technology included Lane Departure Prevention, which uses a small camera mounted above the rearview mirror to gauge distance from the lane markers, and would lightly deploy selected brakes to help ease the car into the correct lane. It allowed for unimpeded lane changes when the turn signal is used and yields control to the driver at all times. Blind Spot Intervention System used sensors to provide a visual warning in the side view mirror. If the car sensed movement toward an obstacle, it provided an audible warning and applied opposite side brakes to guide the vehicle to the correct lane.

===Safety===
The third generation Infiniti M models were given a &quot;Top Safety Pick&quot; by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) by earning a &quot;Good&quot; score for all four IIHS crash tests while also featuring standard stability control to help avoid accidents altogether.

===Engines===

===M35h (Hybrid version) (2011–2019)===
The Infiniti M Hybrid, sold as the Nissan Fuga Hybrid in Japan where it was the top performance trim, introduced Nissan&#x27;s first in-house developed electric hybrid technology, and the carmaker claimed it doubles the fuel economy of its gasoline-powered version. Nissan also announced that the Nissan Infiniti/Fuga Hybrid, together with the Nissan Leaf, included its new Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians system to alert pedestrians, the blind and others to their presence when the hybrid is operating at low speeds in all-electric mode.

The hybrid includes one electric motor and two clutches to allow the 3.5L V6 ( and ) gas engine and electric motor to drive the rear wheels simultaneously. The lithium-ion battery pack comes from the Infiniti Essence. The VQ35HR 3.5 L V6 Hybrid utilizes the Atkinson cycle. The electric motor, installed in parallel between the engine and the transmission, produces from 1.3kWh lithium-ion batteries that are expected to have a service life of 10 years. The batteries are installed upright behind the rear seats. The main sacrifices are that the luggage compartment space is reduced, the hybrid&#x27;s rear seats are fixed in place and cannot fold down, and all-wheel drive is not available. One benefit of the battery placement though, is that it leaves the hybrid with a 51/49 front to rear weight distribution.

The combined power output of the M35H&#x27;s hybrid power-train is at 6500 rpm, and an estimated of torque at 2000 rpm.

Reviewers have considered the 2012 Infiniti M35h, along with the 2011 Porsche Panamera S Hybrid which also debuted in the same calendar year, as among the best executed hybrid performance luxury cars. The M35h and Panamera S Hybrid are the first hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles with an automatic transmission to return frugal fuel economy figures &quot;and&quot; retain the acceleration/handling characteristics of its gasoline-only counterparts. Earlier hybrids such as the Lexus 2007 GS 450h used a CVT for fuel economy at the cost of driving dynamics, while the 2010 BMW ActiveHybrid 7 which has an automatic transmission did not feature significantly improved mileage over its gasoline counterpart. The M35h&#x27;s fuel economy is superior to the M37, and it is almost as fast as the M56 while providing a more balanced, near 50/50, front/rear weight distribution.

On August 23, 2011, the Infiniti M35h set an official Guinness world record for the world&#x27;s fastest accelerating production full hybrid. The feat took place at the United Kingdom&#x27;s Santa Pod Raceway, where CAR magazine journalist Tim Pollard drove the vehicle down the quarter-mile dragstrip in 13.896 seconds. The M35h averaged 13.9031 seconds for all runs, reaching speeds over . Guinness adjudicators were present to witness the run and certify the record. The official claimed 0– time for the Infiniti M35h is 5.5 seconds.

===M30d (Diesel version) (2010–2014)===
In 2010, at the Geneva Motor Show, the Infiniti M was introduced with a diesel engine for the first time. It was sold across Europe starting in September 2010. The V9X diesel engine produces and of torque at 2,500 rpm. In western Europe, this V6 performance diesel was offered as a high performance option in lieu of the M56 V8. The M30d was not sold in the US or Canada.

==Discontinuation==
In 2019, Nissan confirmed that the Infiniti Q70, Q70L, Q30, and QX30 models will be discontinued after the 2019 model year due to poor sales as buyers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico preferred crossovers and SUVs instead of sedans, hatchbacks, wagons, convertibles, and coupes. Another reason for the discontinuation was Nissan&#x27;s plans to withdraw the Infiniti brand from the Australian, New Zealand, South Korean, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Malaysian, and West European markets by the end of 2020, with Nissan already withdrawing the Infiniti brand from the South African market in 2017 due to losses and poor sales. Nissan has no plans of abandoning sedans entirely and plans on possibly introducing an Infiniti EV vehicle in 2021 for the 2022 model year based from QS Inspiration concept.

In 757, these counties and prefectures underwent a name change as Gwolji county became Gwolseong(闕城),Jipumcheon prefecture became Saneum(山陰) and Jeokchon became Daneup(丹邑) and saneum and daneup became a prefecture under the subdivision of Gwolseong county.During the Goryeo period Gwolseong county was demoted to Kangseong prefecture(江城縣) which was later promoted to Kangseong County, and the Daneup became Dangye prefecture.In 1018,Dangye and Saneum became part of hapju(陜州,which later became Hapcheon County), and Kangseong county became the administration of Jinjumok(晉州牧,Mok located in Jinju. Mok was a subdivision based on major cities that would administer dependent towns.). In 1390,Dangye returned to the control of Kangseong county and low level officers called Gammu(監務) was stationed in Saneum and Kangseong. In 1399,Myeongjin prefecture(溟珍縣) moved to be under administration of kangseong prefecture because of Japanese pirates, and the two prefectures merged to become Danseong prefecture(丹城縣). After the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 16th century,Danseong prefecture was abolished in 1599 with part of it given to Saneum, but it was restored in 1613.In 1767, Saneum became Sancheong prefecture(山靑縣).In 1895, Sancheong and Danseong became counties.In 1906 some part of regions that was part of Jinju was incorporated into Sancheong, and Danseong was fully incorporated to Sancheong in 1914.

<text>Uiryeong County () is a county in South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

Uiryeong County has a population of 27,550 (2019) and is one of the least populated counties in South Korea.

==History==
===Early history===
No presence of Neolithic artefacts have been confirmed, however Bronze Age artefacts such as tombstones have been found in the region. The region is thought to have been in the domain of Aragaya (modern day Haman County) and the Bisabeol (modern day Changnyeong County) region, during the Three Kingdoms period in Korea, and is thought to have been under the influence of the Kingdom of Silla, after the province of Haju (下州, 하주) was installed in the region of Changnyeong in 555 (under King Jinheung of Silla). The region was also known as Jangham prefecture (獐含縣, 장함현) under Silla, but the prefecture&#x27;s name was changed to Uiryeong in 757 (under King Gyeongdeok of Silla), and became kind of a subprefecture under Haman prefecture. The Sinban (新反, 신반) region, then also known as Sinui prefecture (辛尒縣, 신이현), Juo township (朱烏村, 주오촌, directly translated as &quot;town of the red raven&quot;) or Cheoncheon prefecture (泉川縣, 천천현, directly translated as the &quot;prefecture of the spring streams&quot;), became the subprefecture in the domains of Gangyang County (江陽郡,강양군, modern day Hapcheon County) with the new name &quot;Uisang prefecture&quot; (宜桑縣, 의상현). 
===Medieval history===
In 1018 (under the Goryeo Dynasty), Uiryeong came under the domain of Jinjumok (晋州牧) and a high official called Gammu was appointed in the region in the year 1390. Uisang prefecture initially went through a name change as Sinbeon prefecture, and was part of Hapju, but it became part of the domain of Uiryeong prefecture in 1390. In 1413, the post of Gammu was abolished, and post of hyeongam was dispatched to the region instead. According to statistics during the reign of King Sejong, there were 504 houses in the Uiryeong region, with a population of 1629, and the Sinbeon region had 555 houses with population of AD 982.

===Modern history===
The region was the center of a righteous army led by general Gwak Jae-u, who rose up as a reaction to the Korean Japanese war of 1592.

====19th century====
As part of an administrative division change, the region became part of Jinjubu as Uiryeong County in 1895, but it became part of South Gyeongsang province in 1896.
====20th century====
During the Japanese colonial era, the county was called Ginei and was a part of the now-defunct Keishōnan Province.

The administrative division changed in 1914, which involved merging Gungryumyeon of Hapcheon County, which made Uiryeong County contain 13 myeons. 

In March 14, 1919, a protest broke out in Uiryeong myeon, and protest was part of an independence movement. The protest went on for 3 days. 

In 1938, Lee Byung-chull, a resident of Uiryeong, founded Samsung in the nearby city of Taikyu (now Daegu).

During the Korean War in the 1950s, the region was devastated by Communist attacks.

On the evening of 26 April 1982, policeman Woo Bum-kon went on a shooting and bombing rampage through several villages in Uiryeong County, killing 62 people and wounding around 35 others in the worst non-terrorist spree killing in history.

==Climate==
==Transportation==
Uiryeong has a convenient location as it sits between Jinju to the west and Haman/Masan/Changwon to the East. A bus runs regularly from the bus terminal in Uiryeong-Eup to all major cities in South Korea. A bus journey to Masan or Jinju takes approximately 35 minutes and 45 minutes respectively from Uiryeong bus terminal, while the journey to Busan takes 1 hour. It is also possible to take a bus directly to Seoul from Uiryeong.

The biggest problem in terms of transportation is that the intercity buses stop running to Uiryeong from the nearby cities fairly early in the evening. The last bus from Busan is 6:40 PM, from Jinju, it&#x27;s 7:30 PM and from Masan, it&#x27;s 9:00 PM.

==Sister cities==
Uiryeong is twinned with:

* Muan, South Korea 
* Yongsan-gu, South Korea
* Uiseong, South Korea
* Liaocheng, China

<doc id="968977" wikidata="Q5146892" url="?curid=968977" title="College of the Ozarks">
<text>College of the Ozarks is a private Christian college in Point Lookout, Missouri. The college has an enrollment of 1,426 and over 30 academic majors in Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science programs.

The college charges no tuition for full-time students due to its student work program and donations. The program requires students to work 15 hours a week at an on-campus work station and two 40-hour work weeks during breaks. A summer work program is available to some students to cover room and board costs. The college refers to itself as &quot;Hard Work U&quot; and places emphasis on character education.

==History==
===Forsyth===
The school was first proposed in 1901 as a high school by James Forsythe, pastor of Forsyth, Missouri Presbyterian Church. (The college now declares itself to be interdenominational.) Forsythe was from the St. Louis, Missouri area.

Forsythe was said to have been inspired to make the proposal after encountering a boy on a squirrel hunt who told him that his parents couldn&#x27;t afford to send him to the closest high school away in Springfield, Missouri.

The School of the Ozarks opened on September 11, 1906, in a building atop Mount Huggins (named for brothers Louis and William Huggins from St. Joseph, Missouri who were among the founders of Nabisco and had donated money for the school). In its first term it had enrollment of 180 with 36 boarders.

From the start, the school adopted its practice of having its students work instead of paying tuition.

On January 12, 1915, the original building was destroyed in a fire. The school temporarily held classes in the Forsyth public school.

===Point Lookout===
The school then relocated farther up the White River at Point Lookout, Missouri on a campus. The campus has changed quite a bit since this era, but has remained at the Point Lookout location ever since. The central building of the campus was the Maine Hunting and Fishing Club building, which had been transported to the site by sportsmen from the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair where it had been the State of Maine exhibit. It was renamed the Dobyns Building in honor of W. R. Dobyns, president of the trustees at the time. The building burned on February 1, 1930.

In the 1920s what would become the Ralph Foster Museum depicting Ozark heritage had its start in the basement of the boys dormitory: Abernathy Hall.

In 1934 the Fruitcake and Jelly Kitchen opened to offer work for students. It is now one of 90 work stations. More than 100 fruitcakes are now baked daily.

===1950s expansion===

In the 1950s under Robert M. Good and M. Graham Clark the school dramatically changed.

The campus expanded to , the school&#x27;s Gothic chapel was built on the location of the original Dobyns Building and a hospital was added.

In 1956, with high schools becoming increasingly available in the area, the school became a junior college.

The Museum of the Ozarks took over the entire Abernathy Building and was renamed the Good Museum after president Good. It was later renamed for country music pioneer Ralph D. Foster, who donated money and exhibits for it. The museum expanded in 1969, 1977 and 1991. Among the exhibits is an original George Barris 1921 modified Oldsmobile &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; truck donated by series creator Paul Henning who was inspired to do the show after a Boy Scout camping trip in the Ozarks. The museum also contains a large firearm display, including a rifle belonging to Pancho Villa.

===1960s to present===
In 1965 it became a four-year college, but it did not garner regional accreditation until the 1990s.

In 1994 it was renamed the College of the Ozarks when regional accreditation was conferred.

The former president, Jerry C. Davis, instituted five goals for the college that now stand as their pillars for students to emulate:

* Academic
* Vocational
* Christian
* Patriotic
* Cultural
According to the school, out of more than 4,000 applicants, approximately 400 students are accepted to College of the Ozarks each fall semester. Students are encouraged to have at least a 20 composite on the ACT, or a 1030 on the SAT. A GPA of at least a 3.0 and ranking in the top 50% of their class is also preferred. College of the Ozarks also considers other factors for admission such as leadership, service, and financial need.

=== Controversies ===
The College of the Ozarks has faced numerous controversies, particularly regarding its policies against LGBT people, its strict biblically inspired moral code, lack of ethnic and racial diversity, and its boycott of Nike products following an ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick. Former LGBT students recounted pressure to undergo conversion therapy, a widely condemned practice based on pseudoscience that claims to change sexual orientation.

In 1994, the college was compared to Jonestown due to its lack of academic freedom, which contributed to struggles with accreditation.

During the 2003–2004 semesters, a professor revealed that one of the college&#x27;s deans, Larry Cockrum, had obtained a fraudulent Ph.D. from Crescent City Christian College, a diploma mill. The professor was suspended and later terminated for bringing this to light, while the college&#x27;s then-president, Jerry C. Davis, defended the dean. Larry Cockrum later became president of The University of the Cumberlands.

In 2017, the college introduced a controversial requirement for incoming freshmen to take a course titled &quot;Patriotic Education and Fitness,&quot; which combines military-style physical education with military science to promote patriotism.

The college has also faced criticism for its low representation of African American students. A 1993 article in The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education ranked the College of the Ozarks second to last among Christian colleges in terms of the proportion of black students, with only 0.1% of its student body being black. Additionally, the college&#x27;s decision to boycott Nike products after the Colin Kaepernick ad was criticized for racial overtones.

In 2017, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; ranked the College of the Ozarks as the most hostile campus toward LGBT and non-binary people. In response, public relations director Valorie Coleman stated that the school does not consider itself hostile, though it enforces strict rules against &quot;sexual immorality&quot;. The college employs licensed counselors who openly practice conversion therapy, leaving reparative therapy materials in their offices. The institution&#x27;s rigid enforcement of conservative Christian values has drawn sharp criticism for promoting harmful practices and stifling the expression of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.

The Keeter Center Hotel, operated by the college, reserves the right to prohibit events or services inconsistent with the college&#x27;s beliefs, though it claims this policy is not intended to exclude or discriminate against legally protected groups. However, this practice, coupled with the college&#x27;s ongoing lawsuit against the Biden administration over dormitory segregation policies, demonstrates its continued resistance to contemporary interpretations of equality and anti-discrimination laws.

In November 2018, two students were abducted and sexually assaulted after arriving at campus ten minutes after curfew. Though the college stated that students could call security to be let in after curfew, alumni have reported fear of expulsion for missing curfew, with some resorting to sleeping in their cars to avoid punishment.

===Presidents===
Since 1906, there have been 15 presidents, 2 acting presidents and two chancellors.

*1906 – A. Y. Beatie
*1907 – George Gordon Robertson
*1907–10 – W. I. Utterback

== Athletics ==
The College of the Ozarks (CofO) athletic teams are called the Bobcats. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Sooner Athletic Conference (SAC) since the 2024–25 academic year. The Bobcats are also a member of the National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA), primarily competing as an independent (full-time from 2021–22 to 2022–23) in the Central Region of the Division I level.

CofO competes in ten intercollegiate varsity sports teams. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country and track &amp; field, while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, track &amp; field and volleyball.

Previously, CofO competed in the NAIA as a core active member the Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference (MCAC) from 1994–95 to 2014–15 (the final season after which the conference was later dissolved). Then CofO competed in the Association of Independent Institutions (AII, basically as an independent school in the NAIA) from 2015–16 to 2020–21 (and later again during the 2023–24 school year when it returned back to the NAIA).

=== Basketball ===
The 2005–06 men&#x27;s basketball team won the NAIA Division II national championship, while the Lady Cats were the runner up. The men&#x27;s team was second in the basketball tournament in 2000 and 2009. From 2000 to 2017, Keeter Gymnasium was host to the NAIA Division II Basketball Championship games. In 2014, Ozarks made headlines by defeating second-ranked College of Idaho in the national tournament.

In the wake of the 2016–2017 national anthem protests at athletic events in the United States, the college announced that they would refuse to play any team whose players took a knee in the same manner as the protests. In response, College of the Ozarks chose to withdraw from hosting the Division II men&#x27;s basketball champion game and agreed to aid in moving it to another venue. The championship game had been held there since 2000. In September 2018, the president of the college released a statement explaining that the school would no longer use uniforms made by Nike: &quot;If Nike is ashamed of America, we are ashamed of them.&quot;

=== Leaving the NAIA ===
In March 2021, mid-season, former college president Jerry C. Davis decided to drop out of NAIA athletics competition (effective immediately during the 2020–21 school year), with no prior warning or discussion with players, coaches, or administrators. The president did not give a reason for the decision. After two years in the NCCAA, the school returned to the NAIA in 2023.

<doc id="968985" wikidata="Q386111" url="?curid=968985" title="Diego Ramírez Islands">
<text>The Diego Ramírez Islands () are a small group of Chilean subantarctic islands located at the southernmost extreme of South America.

==History==
The islands were sighted on 12 February 1619 by the Spanish Garcia de Nodal expedition, and named after the cosmographer of the expedition, Diego Ramírez de Arellano. They were cited as the southernmost land mass plotted as of that time, and retained the distinction for 156 years, until the discovery of the South Sandwich Islands in 1775.

In 1892, the Chilean government rented the islands to Pedro Pablo Benavides for fishing and on condition that a lighthouse, a port, and a school would be built. Later the rent was transferred to Koenigswerther and Pasinowich.

The Chilean Navy established a meteorological station above Caleta Condell, a small cove on the northeastern side of Isla Gonzalo (Gonzalo Island), in 1957, and resupplies it several times each year. This is the southernmost inhabited outpost outside Antarctica. The next most southerly inhabited outpost is the lighthouse of Cape Horn. Cruise ships occasionally pass by on their way to and from Antarctica.

== Geography ==
The islands lie about west-southwest of Cape Horn and south-southeast of Ildefonso Islands, stretching north-south. They are divided into a smaller northern group with six islets, and a larger southern group, separated by a passage wide. The two largest islands, Isla Bartolomé and Isla Gonzalo, both lie in the southern group. Águila Islet (&quot;Islote Águila&quot;), the southernmost land of the group, is at latitude and longitude coordinates 56°32&#x27;9&quot;S. They lie about 350 km north of Sars Bank, a seamount that once may have been an island.

=== Islands ===

Area data are from the USGS unless otherwise specified.


==Climate==
The islands have a tundra climate (&quot;ET)&quot; with abundant precipitation. Temperatures remain chilly to cool throughout the entire year.

==Environment==
===Important Bird Area===
The islands have been designated as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for their significant seabird breeding populations. These include colonies of macaroni and southern rockhopper penguins, grey-headed and black-browed albatrosses, and blue petrels.

In 2022, Ricardo Rozzi et al. identified the subantarctic rayadito (&quot;Aphrastura subantarctica&quot;) as a new bird species endemic to the Diego Ramírez Islands. Subantarctic rayadito individuals had been formerly identified as belonging to the species &quot;Aphrastura spinicauda&quot; (thorn-tailed rayadito).

<doc id="968991" wikidata="Q5278210" url="?curid=968991" title="Dingle, Liverpool">
<text>Dingle (known locally as the Dingle) is an inner city area of Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is located to the south of the city, bordered by the adjoining districts of Toxteth and Aigburth. At the 2001 Census, the population was recorded at 13,246.

==History==

Dingle is an area entirely within the boundaries of the old Toxteth Park. It is named after Dingle Brook (&quot;Dingle&quot; meaning a wooded valley), which rose at High Park Street and roughly followed Park Road towards the Old Toxteth Chapel, just south of Dingle Lane, and entered the River Mersey at Knott&#x27;s Hole, which was a narrow bay or inlet next to where the Dingle flowed out to the Mersey.

On either side were steep rocky cliffs, with Dingle Point to the south west. In the 1850s the Dingle area was purely rural. Liverpool lay to the north west, but this was an area of large houses, vast gardens, babbling streams and a long beach.

It was a mainly Protestant area, which developed from the influx of Welsh settlers, whilst the north end of Liverpool such as Everton and Vauxhall was settled by Irish immigrants, and became mainly Irish Catholic.

Between 1896 and 1956, the Liverpool Overhead Railway&#x27;s terminus and only underground station was Dingle railway station, located on Park Road, the Dingle. This was the end of the line for services from Seaforth Sands in the north of the city, not to be confused with Seaforth and Litherland on the Merseyrail line to Southport.

==Description==

Dingle is the last of the southern inner-city districts of Liverpool. Further south of Dingle are the suburbs. This area is traditionally working class, housing being mostly terraced, although many of the terraced streets are being pulled down to make room for more modern development.

Like many districts in Liverpool, there is not universal agreement about where the Dingle begins/ends. The old township of &#x27;Toxteth Park&#x27; covers a much bigger area encompassing Parliament Street, Lodge Lane, Smithdown Road, Penny Lane, Greenbank Road, Aigburth Vale and St Michael-in-the-Hamlet. Some locals regard Dingle as being within the area encompassed by Warwick Street, in the north, Princes Road, Devonshire Road and Dingle Lane. Some define the Dingle as above but only as far as Grafton Street and not to the bank of the Mersey, as this area was part of Liverpool Docks. The area between Admiral Street and Princes Road is known as Princes Park, after the nearby parkland.

Location filming for the BBC television series &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; written by Alan Bleasdale and also &quot;Bread&quot;, written by Carla Lane, was primarily in Dingle&#x27;s Garswood Street and Elswick Street respectively. In 2007, residents in the Shorefields area of Dingle signed a petition to block plans for a new twelve storey residential development on the infilled Herculaneum Dock.

==Transport==
The nearest railway stations are Brunswick for people living in the Grafton Street area and St Michaels for those living in the Dingle Lane area.

Both stations are on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail system. Regular trains depart for Liverpool city centre, Southport and Hunts Cross.

Bus services are provided by Arriva North West and Stagecoach Merseyside &amp; South Lancashire.

<text>6SN7 is a dual triode vacuum tube with an eight-pin octal base. It provides a medium gain (20 dB). The 6SN7 is basically two 6J5 triodes in one envelope.

==History==
The 6SN7 was originally released in 1939. It was officially registered in 1941 by RCA and Sylvania as the glass-cased 6SN7GT, originally listed on page 235 of RCA&#x27;s 1940 RC-14 Receiving Tube Manual, in the Recently Added section, as: 6SN7-GT. Although the 6S-series tubes are often metal-cased, there was never a &quot;metal-envelope&quot; 6SN7 (there being no pin available to connect the metal shield); there were, however, a few glass-envelope tubes with a metal band, such as the 6SN7A developed during World War II - slightly improved in some respects but the metal band was prone to splitting.

Numerous variations on the 6SN7 type have been offered over the years, including:
* 7N7 (Sylvania 1940, short-lived loktal-base version),
* 1633 (RCA 1941, also for 26-V radios),
* 12SX7 (RCA 1946, intended for use in 12-volt aircraft electronics),
* 5692 (RCA 1948, a super-premium version - not exactly identical - with guaranteed 10,000-hour lifetime),
* &quot;6Н8С&quot; (Cyrillic, Soviet version, , in Latin letters: 6N8S);
* 6SN7 DDR, 6Н8М, E1606 (=CV278), OSW3129 versions with different/larger glass envelopes;
* 6042 (1951, another 1633 type), and
* 6180 (1952)
* 6SN7W (1956; a more rugged military version, glass envelope with metal band)

The American military designator for the 6SN7GA is VT-231. The British called it CV1988. European designations include the 1942 ECC32 (not an exact equivalent), 13D2 and B65.

The 6SN7 has a 6.3 V 600 mA heater/filament. The 12-volt 300 mA filament equivalent is the 12SN7GT or 12SN7GTA. The 14N7 is the Loktal version of the 12SN7GT. There was also a comparatively rare 8V 8SN7 for 450 mA series-string TV sets) and 25 Volt/0.15 Amp heater version: 25SN7GT.

== Related types ==
The 1937 6F8G was also an octal-based double triode with essentially the same characteristics as the 6SN7 (or two 6J5&#x27;s), but in a &#x27;Coke Bottle&#x27; large (Outline ST-12) glass envelope with a different pin arrangement and utilising a top cap connection for the first triode&#x27;s grid (making pin 1 available for a metal shield).

== 6J5 ==
The 6J5, first registered in June 1937, and 6J5GT (registered April 1938; British version L63) were octal single triodes with identical characteristics to one half of a 6SN7. Other equivalents to the 6J5 include: 
* VT-94, 6C2, 6J5M, 38565J; 
* military versions: CV1933, 10E/11448 and CV1934; 
* Loktal base version: 7A4 (military name: CV1770), and 
* 12.6 V heater version: 12J5. 
They in turn were successors to the 1935 RCA 6C5 and 1938 6P5G.

==Successors to the 6SN7 ==
The 1954 6CG7 and 6FQ7 are electrically equivalent to the 6SN7, with nine-pin miniature (&quot;Noval&quot;) base (RCA, 1951), also made as an 8.4V 450mA series string heater type as the 8CG7.

In contrast to what some sources claim, the ECC40 with Rimlock base and introduced by Philips in 1948 cannot be considered a successor to the 6SN7 as the electrical characteristics are too different.

The 1946 miniature 12AU7/ECC82, with similar, but not identical, electrical characteristics to the 6SN7 and ECC32, and a filament usable on either 6.3V or 12.6V supplies, is more widely used than the 6CG7/6FQ7.

== Usage ==

The 6SN7 was used as an audio amplifier in the 1940-1955 period, usually in the driver stages of power amps. The designer of the famous Williamson amplifier, one of the first true high-fidelity designs, suggested use of the 6SN7 (or B65) in his 1949 revision since it is similar to the original circuit&#x27;s L63 (=6J5) British single triodes, four of which were used in each channel of his 1947 circuit.

The 6SN7 was one of the most important components of the first programmable electronic digital computer, the ENIAC, which contained several thousand of the tubes. The SAGE computer systems used hundreds of 5692s as flip-flops.

With the advent of television, the 6SN7 was well suited for use as a vertical-deflection amplifier. As screen sizes became larger, voltage and power headroom became insufficient. To address this, uprated versions with higher peak voltage and power ratings were introduced. The GE 6SN7GTA (GE, 1950) had anode dissipation uprated to 5.0 watts. The 1954 GE 6SN7GTB also had controlled heater warmup time, better for series heater strings.

The 6SN7 was considered to be obsolete by the 1960s, replaced by the 12AU7, and became almost unobtainable. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, vacuum tubes of all types ceased to be manufactured by the major producers. A small demand for vacuum tubes in guitar amplifiers and very expensive high-fidelity equipment remained. As existing stocks ran out, factories in eastern Europe and China started to manufacture the 6SN7, and higher-gain 6SL7. , 6SN7s and 6SL7s are still manufactured in Russia and by JJ Electronic, and are widely available.

<text>The Porsche 987 is the internal designation for the second generation Porsche Boxster sports car. It made its debut at the 2004 Paris Motor Show alongside the 911 (997) and went on sale in 2005.

In 2005, it was joined in the range by the new Cayman fastback coupé (project 987c) with which it shared the same mid-engine platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior.

It was replaced by the Porsche 981 in 2012.

==Boxster 987.1==

The 987 was the second generation Boxster model, but remained very similar to the previous generation. The most obvious styling change is to the headlights, which now have a profile similar to those of the Carrera GT, Porsche&#x27;s flagship mid-engine sports car of the time. The intake vents on the sides of the Boxster were now larger, with more pronounced horizontal slats and are coloured metallic silver, irrespective of the paint colour on the rest of the car. The wheel arches were enlarged to allow wheels up to 19 inches in diameter, a first for the Boxster series.

The most significant updates from the 986 series are in the interior, with a more prominent circular theme evident in the instrument cluster and cooling vents. Porsche claims that the 987 Boxster shares only 20% of its components with its predecessor. The base engine is a 2.7-litre flat-6, with the Boxster S getting a 3.2-litre engine. The Cayman 2-door fastback coupé is derived from the 987.

For the 2007 model year, the base Boxster received a revised engine featuring VarioCam Plus to provide a power increase ( the same as the Cayman). The Boxster S&#x27; engine was upgraded from 3.2-litre to 3.4-litre, resulting in a power increase of more ( the same as the Cayman S). These upgrades made the Boxster series and the Cayman series equivalent in terms of power.

== Boxster 987.2 ==
Porsche first revealed the new revised 987.2 2008 Boxster and Boxster S models at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2008, using totally new engines (MA1.20/MA1.21). Both models featured greater power due to an increase in engine displacement for the Boxster and the incorporation of Direct Fuel Injection (DFI) for the Boxster S. Both models were available with Porsche&#x27;s new 7-speed &quot;Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe&quot; (PDK) dual clutch gearbox but came standard with a new 6-speed manual gearbox. Displacement in the standard Boxster&#x27;s flat-six engine increased from 2.7 to 2.9 liters, increasing power from to . Use of DFI in the Boxster S raised the output of the 3.4-litre engine from to . Cosmetic changes to the 2009 Boxster and Boxster S included new head and tail lights, larger front air intakes with incorporated daytime running lights, and an altered lower rear end flanked by twin diffusers. The interior included the redesigned Porsche Communication Management System as an option with a touchscreen interface to reduce button clutter.

=== Special models ===
==== RS60 Spyder ====
In November 2007, Porsche announced a commemorative RS60 Spyder edition of the Boxster to celebrate Porsche&#x27;s 1960 win in the 12 Hours of Sebring in Florida. Only 1,960 units were produced worldwide, with approximately 800 slated for the U.S. with each model bearing a numbered production badge on the dash. The RS60 Spyder came only in GT Silver Metallic exterior colour while the standard interior is Carrera Red leather, with dark gray leather as an option. The RS60 came standard with 19 inch SportDesign alloy wheels, Porsche&#x27;s Active Suspension Management System, and a sports exhaust that increased the engine output to .

The limited production Boxster S Porsche Design Edition 2 debuted in October 2008 as 2009 model. It featured a free-flowing exhaust system, which raised power from at 6,250 rpm to at an identical 6,250 rpm. It came in a unified Carrera White paint scheme with matching white 19-inch wheels, a black and grey interior with white gauges, red taillights and light grey stripes along the entire body. 500 were made for the worldwide market, 32 shipped into the U.S. and 18 into Canada.

Porsche unveiled its 2008 Limited Edition Boxster and Boxster S models at a private gathering at the occasion of the 2007 New York Auto Show. Largely inspired by the 2007 911 GT3 RS, only 250 examples of each model were produced in brilliant orange. Other special exterior features included glossy black painted mirrors, alloy wheels, front and side air inlets, and model designation. The SportDesign package was included as standard which includes aggressive front splitters, a revised rear two-stage spoiler that extends automatically at speed, and an integrated rear diffuser. A sports exhaust system with a dual chromed exhaust tip completed the exterior modifications. On the interior, a numbered &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27; plaque is found on the glove box door, while the seat inserts, 911 GT3-spec steering wheel, and handbrake lever all receive Alcantara trim, a suede-like material. Orange roll-over hoops, door lever surrounds, shift knob, cup-holder cover trim and even the font on the gear shift pattern carrying bright orange that match the exterior colour and offset the otherwise black interior.

==== Boxster Spyder ====

On 5 November 2009, Porsche officially announced a new variant of the Boxster, which was officially unveiled at the 2009 Los Angeles Motor Show. Positioned above the Boxster S, the Boxster Spyder was the lightest Porsche on the market at the time, weighing , lighter than a Boxster S. This was achieved through the elimination of the conventional soft top&#x27;s operating mechanism, the radio/PCM unit, door handles, air conditioning, storage compartments, cup holders and large LED light modules on the front fascia, although some of these could be re-added to the car in the form of options. Weight saving was also gained using aluminum doors, an aluminum rear deck and the lightest 19-inch wheels in the Porsche pallet. The Spyder has a firmer suspension setup than the other Boxster models, and is almost one inch lower in order to have improved handling. A manually operated canvas top, carbon fibre sports bucket seats and two signature humps running along the back of the vehicle provide characteristic design elements. It is powered by a six-cylinder boxer engine rated at and of torque, a increase in power over the Boxster S and the related Cayman S. The Boxster Spyder came with a 6-speed manual transmission as standard and had Porsche&#x27;s 7-speed PDK dual-clutch gearbox available as an option. The vehicle was released worldwide in February 2010 as a 2011 model.

==== Boxster E ====

The 987 chassis was used to develop three battery-electric prototypes in 2011, each known as the Boxster E, as part of the &quot;Model Region Electro-Mobility Stuttgart&quot; practical trial. One prototype was equipped with electric traction motors for both the front and rear axles, while the other two were equipped with motors on the rear axle only. Each motor was the same, producing and , with a single-speed transmission and maximum speed of 12,000 RPM. The two-motor variant had a combined output of and . The Boxster E prototypes were unveiled at the Michelin Challenge Bibendum in May 2011.

The two-motor Boxster E had a claimed performance of 0– of 5.5 seconds and a top speed of ; the rear-motor Es had a respective sprint time of 9.8 seconds and top speed of . On the NEDC, the rated range was , using a battery with 29 kW-hr gross capacity (26 kW-hr usable). The entire vehicle weighed , of which was the traction battery.
==Cayman 987.1==
After two years of development, the first model of the fastback coupé to be released was the Cayman S (type 987120). Photographs and technical details were released in May 2005, but the public unveiling took place at the September Frankfurt Motor Show. The S suffix (for Sport or Special) indicated that this was a higher performance version of a then unreleased base model. That model, the Cayman (987110), went on sale in July 2006.

The Cayman fastback coupé (project 987c) and the second generation Boxster roadster (project 987) shared the same mid-engine platform and many components, including the front fenders and trunk lid, doors, headlights, taillights, and forward portion of the interior. The design of the Cayman&#x27;s body incorporates styling cues from classic Porsches; 356/1, the 550 Coupé and the 904 Coupé.
The 987.1 Cayman used the M97.20 and M97.21 engines.

Unlike the Boxster, the Cayman has a hatchback for access to luggage areas on top of and in the back of the engine cover. The entire rear section rear-wards of the side doors of the Cayman is made from stainless steel. The suspension design is fundamentally the same as that of the Boxster with revised settings due to the stiffer chassis with the car&#x27;s fixed roof.

The 3.4-litre flat-6 boxer engine (M97.21) in the first generation Cayman S was derived from the 3.2-litre (M96.26) that was used in the Boxster S, with cylinder heads from the 997 S&#x27;s 3.8-litre engine (M97.01), which have the VarioCam Plus inlet valve timing and lift system. A less powerful but more fuel efficient version, the 2.7-litre M97.20, powered the base model. The use of these engines exclusively in Caymans ended in the 2007 model year when Porsche upgraded the Boxster (987310) and Boxster S (987320).

A 5-speed manual transaxle is standard on the Cayman (G87.01), while a 6-speed manual (Getrag 466) was the standard transmission for the S model (G87.21) and an option on the base model (A87.20). An electronically controlled 5-speed automatic transaxle (Tiptronic) was also available on the S (A87.21) and the non-S version (A87.02) (The 2009 models replaced this option with a seven-speed &quot;PDK&quot;, Porsche&#x27;s dual clutch transmission. Other options include active shock absorbers (ThyssenKrupp Bilstein GmbH&#x27;s &quot;DampTronic&quot;, rebadged as &quot;PASM&quot; by Porsche), ceramic disc brakes (&quot;PCCB&quot;), xenon headlights (Hella&#x27;s &quot;Bi-Xenon&quot;) and an electronically controlled sport mode (&quot;Sport Chrono Package&quot;).

The first generation Cayman ceased production in November 2011.

=== Cayman 987.1 Specifications ===
Performance
The Cayman S&#x27; performances equalled the performance of Porsche&#x27;s flagship models at the time. Rally driver Walter Röhrl lapped the Nürburgring Nordschleife track in a Cayman S equipped with optional 19&quot; wheels, PCCB, and PASM in a time of 8 minutes, 11 seconds. The time for a standard Cayman S, as published by the manufacturer, was 8 minutes, 20 seconds. In contrast, Röhrl recorded 8 minutes, 15 seconds in a 911 Carrera.

A Cayman prepared and run by private team of Jürgen and Uwe Alzen finished fourth overall (of 220 entrants) in the 2007 Nürburgring 24 Hour race, ahead of two flagship Porsche 997 GT3 RSR&#x27;s, a 997 GT3 Cup, and a 996 GT3 Cup. Another two privateer Caymans, entered by CSR and MSpeed, finished 22nd and 117th overall, respectively. Porsche disclaims support for the Cayman teams, while supporting some or all of the 997 teams.

Starting with the 2009 model, a limited slip differential was available as an option. The base Cayman received an engine upgrade to 2.9 L (), and the Cayman S a 3.4 L (). The factory tuned 2008 Cayman S Sport with its special exhaust system produces from its 3.4 L engine.
== Cayman 987.2 ==

A revised version of the Porsche Cayman 987 was introduced on 21 February 2009, with a totally new engine (MA1.20/MA1.21). The standard Cayman engine&#x27;s displacement was increased from 2.7 L to 2.9 L, giving a increase to , while the Cayman S gained direct injection and a increase to . The new engines no longer had the Intermediate Shaft, which proved to be a weak link in pre-2009 engines. Both the Cayman and Cayman S maintained a power advantage over their roadster sibling, the Boxster. The design for the front bumper was also kept distinct for the two models. The front signal lamps are designed differently: while both use LED signal lamps, the Cayman&#x27;s are arranged like the face of dice while the Boxster has a horizontal row of 4 LEDs. The Porsche Tiptronic S automatic gearbox was replaced by the 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission for the new model. 
Also a limited slip differential is now a factory option. The Cayman R was introduced in 2011 as the pinnacle of the 987.2 generation with a reduced weight, increased power, improved aerodynamics and handling.

==== Cayman R ====

The Cayman R was introduced in 2011 as the pinnacle of the 987 generation. Based on the 2009 987.2 Cayman S, the Cayman R was lighter and came with additional power and handling upgrades.

Weight Saving: a weight saving over the Cayman S was achieved with the use of 19 inch lightweight wheels shared with the Boxster Spyder, aluminium doors from the 997 911 GT3, carbon fibre bucket seats from the 997 911 GT2, and with the removal of the radio, storage compartments, air-conditioning, door handles and rear wiper.. Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) system was an additional option available for the Cayman R.

Styling: The Cayman R also received various cosmetic changes, such as decals on the doors, instrument cover delete, gloss black painted mirrors, black &#x27;R&#x27; model designation emblem on the trunk, dashboard and door sills, as well as black painted wheels. 

Aerodynamics: There were minor changes to aerodynamics with the Cayman R, mostly coming from the use of the rarely selected Porsche OEM aerokit, introduced as an option in 2007. A carbon rear spoiler was added as well as more aggressive front fascia spoilers.

Suspension: With all new passive sports suspension, the Cayman R was lower than a Cayman S equipped with PASM, or a full lower than a Cayman S equipped with standard passive suspension. 

Powertrain: The powertrain is a direct injection flat-six engine rated at 330 PS, at 7,400 rpm and of torque at 4,750 rpm. 6 speed manual or 7 speed PDK automatic gearboxes were offered.

Performance: The standard Cayman R can accelerate from 0– in 5 seconds, with the optional 7-speed PDK dual clutch transmission, it can accelerate from 0– in 4.9 seconds, and with the optional Sport Chrono Package offering launch control it can accelerate from 0– in 4.7 seconds. The Cayman R with the manual transmission can reach a top speed of , and with the PDK.

<doc id="969010" wikidata="Q1524366" url="?curid=969010" title="Blackness Castle">
<text>Blackness Castle is a 15th-century fortress, near the village of Blackness, Scotland, on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.

It was built, probably on the site of an earlier fort, by Sir George Crichton in the 1440s. At this time, Blackness was the main port serving the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, one of the main residences of the Scottish monarch. The castle, together with the Crichton lands, passed to James II of Scotland in 1453, and the castle has been crown property ever since. It served as a state prison, holding such prisoners as Cardinal Beaton and the 6th Earl of Angus.

Strengthened by Sir James Hamilton of Finnart in the mid-16th century, the castle became one of the most advanced artillery fortifications of its time in Scotland. A century later, these defences were not enough to prevent Blackness falling to Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army in 1650. Some years after the siege, the castle was repaired, and again served as a prison and a minor garrison. In 1693, the spur protecting the gate was heightened, and the Stern Tower shortened as a base for three heavy guns. Barracks and officers&#x27; quarters were added in the 1870s, when the castle was used as an ammunition depot, until 1912. The castle was briefly reused by the army during World War I. It is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland.

Because of its site, jutting into the Forth, and its long, narrow shape, the castle has been characterised as &quot;the ship that never sailed&quot;. The north and south towers are often named &quot;stem&quot; and &quot;stern&quot;, with the central tower called the &quot;main mast&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===
The barony of Blackness was held in the mid-15th century by Sir George Crichton, Lord High Admiral of Scotland, Sheriff of Linlithgow, and later Earl of Caithness. The Crichtons were one of the most politically powerful Scottish families at the time, and were close to James II; George Crichton was governor of Stirling Castle when the King murdered the 8th Earl of Douglas there in 1452, and Crichton&#x27;s cousin, William, was Chancellor of Scotland from 1439 to 1453. The castle was probably built in the mid-1440s, during a time of feuding between the Crichtons and the &quot;Black&quot; Douglases, which had resulted in the destruction of Crichton&#x27;s tower at Barnton in Edinburgh in 1444.

Blackness Castle is first mentioned in 1449, and was already serving as a state prison as well as Crichton&#x27;s residence. The original building comprised a curtain wall and the north tower, with the central tower isolated in the central courtyard. A hall range may have stood to the south, while the whole was defended by a rock-cut ditch and accessed by a gate in the east wall.

George Crichton handed over the Crichton lands, including Blackness Castle, to James II in 1453. His dispossessed heir, James Crichton, captured the castle and held it briefly against the King, who besieged and recaptured it the same year. Blackness became a royal fortress, as well as continuing to serve as a prison, and was put into the care of a keeper, who was often the Sheriff of Linlithgow.

James IV came to Blackness on 11 July 1506 after visiting the Isle of May sailing with the &quot;Lion&quot; and another ship. He was welcomed by four shawm players. In November 1512 the &quot;Great Michael&quot; and the &quot;Margaret&quot; were at Blackness. James IV came aboard the &quot;Michael&quot; on St Andrew&#x27;s day to hold an audience with the French ambassador, Charles de Tocque, sieur de la Mothe. The Auld Alliance of Scotland and France was confirmed.

In the 17th century, the office of Keeper of Blackness became hereditary in the Livingstone family.

===Fortification and destruction===

Between 1534 and 1540, a programme of fortification was carried out under the direction of the King&#x27;s Master of Works, Sir James Hamilton of Finnart. Finnart, the illegitimate son of the Earl of Arran, was an expert in artillery fortification. Having spent time in Europe studying the subject, he designed his own castle at Craignethan in Lanarkshire as a showcase for his ideas. At Blackness, he introduced technological innovations including a complex entrance with a caponier, one of only three surviving in Scotland (the others being at Craignethan and Stirling Castle). The caponier, a passage within the external wall of the entrance, allowed defenders to fire into the entrance area, at the backs of any attackers who had breached the gate. The curtain wall was thickened on the inside to the south and east, from to over in places, and gun ports were opened up. The south wall was also heightened to enclose the new south tower.

Work continued after Finnart&#x27;s execution for treason in 1540, under the superintendence of the parson of Dysart, and the &quot;dungeon&quot; and kitchen towers were roofed with turf called &quot;brume and dovet&quot;. Major building works came to a halt in 1542 on the death of James V. Following the battle of Pinkie, on 15 September 1547 Richard Broke and the &quot;Galley Subtle&quot; rowed up the river to Blackness. After an exchange of fire he captured the &quot;Mary Willoughby&quot;, the &quot;Anthony of Newcastle&quot; and the &quot;Bosse&quot;, and burnt other ships.

During the crisis of the Scottish Reformation the castle was surrendered by negotiation to James Hamilton, Duke of Châtellerault as leader of the Lords of the Congregation. Two English captains, Dethick and Wood, then took possession on Easter Day, 15 April 1560. Minor repairs were carried out to the castle during these years.

During the Marian civil war which followed the forced abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots in 1567, the garrison of Blackness remained loyal to her. However, the Keeper, Alexander Stewart, later changed sides to join the Regent Moray&#x27;s party. In 1572, Lord Claud Hamilton recaptured the castle for Mary, harrying shipping in the Forth until the following year, despite being blockaded. On 27 January 1573, James Kirkcaldy, the brother of William Kirkcaldy of Grange who held Edinburgh Castle for Queen Mary, arrived at Blackness from France with arms and money for the Queen&#x27;s side. His ship was captured the next day and Regent Morton laid siege. James Kirkcaldy and the castle surrendered within a week.

In 1580 Malcolm Douglas of the Mains delivered the castle to Lord Robert Stewart. Stewart complained that Douglas had removed the great iron &quot;yett of the dungeon&quot; the gate of the tower, and its lock and the prison-house lock, and timber platforms from the parapets, making it impossible to defend the castle. James Cochrane was the keeper for Sir James Sandilands, their prisoners included the Earl of Huntly in 1592, and John Wemyss of Logie in 1594.

The castle&#x27;s defences were not tested again until 1650, when Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army besieged Blackness during his invasion of Scotland. However, by this time artillery technology had improved beyond anything that Finnart&#x27;s defences could withstand, and the garrison soon surrendered under bombardment from land and sea. The damaged castle was abandoned.

===Later years===
The castle was not repaired until 1667, when it was again used as a prison, holding a number of Covenanters; religious rebels who opposed the King&#x27;s interference in church affairs. The south tower was rearranged, with a bakehouse installed in the basement, and a new stair tower. Further changes were made in 1693, when the spur was heightened with a wall-walk, and the north tower was reduced to provide three gun platforms overlooking the Forth.

After the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, the castle ceased to be a prison, instead being one of four Scottish fortresses to be maintained and garrisoned by the British Army, the others being Stirling, Dumbarton and Edinburgh. The garrison at Blackness numbered around fifteen men in the late 18th century. Between 1759 and 1815 Blackness was again pressed into service as a prison, this time to hold French prisoners of war during the series of conflicts of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, including the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Napoleonic Wars.

In 1870, the role of Blackness changed again, and it became the central ammunition depot for Scotland. Numerous works were carried out, including the roofing-over of the entire courtyard, and the levelling of the ground to the east. The defensive ditch was filled in and barracks built to the south. The cast-iron pier was constructed in 1868, with a gate and a drawbridge, one of the last to be built in Britain. The depot closed in 1912, although it was briefly reoccupied during World War I, and the castle passed into the care of the Office of Works. A restoration programme was undertaken between 1926 and 1935, which entailed the removal of almost all the 19th-century works, and the rebuilding of medieval-style features, which may not fully reflect the original features of the castle.

==Description==

The castle stands on a rocky spit in the Firth of Forth, and is oriented north–south. The castle comprises a curtain wall, with integrated north and south towers, and a separate central tower in the courtyard. To the south-west, a defensive spur forms the main entrance, while a water gate to the north-west gives access to the 19th-century pier. Outside the walls are 19th-century soldiers&#x27; barracks and officers&#x27; quarters. The castle is said in popular legend to have a ley tunnel linking it with the House of the Binns, which lies about south.

===North and South Towers===
Originally of three storeys, the small North, or Stem, Tower was reduced to two storeys in 1693. The upper chamber had a fireplace, while the lower chamber was a pit prison. Accessed only from a trap-door above, this chamber has a drain opening to the sea, which washes in at high tide.

The South, or Stern, Tower dates largely from the mid-16th century, possibly replacing an earlier hall block. On the south wall, the 16th-century stonework was added onto the battlements of the 15th-century curtain wall, leaving the pattern of alternating low and high sections &quot;fossilised&quot; in the wall. The tower is built over the thick-walled artillery positions in the basement, which defend the south and east approaches, and have similarities with the contemporary &quot;blockhouse&quot; at Dunbar Castle, further along the coast. The gunloops in the basement are up to across at the mouth. The South Tower provided the main accommodation in the castle, with chambers in the north-west wing, and a large hall on the upper storey. This hall was subdivided during the castle&#x27;s time as an ammunition depot, although it has since been reinstated. In the 17th century, the large south-facing window was in use as a gun emplacement.

===Central Tower===

The five-storey Central Tower, or &quot;main mast&quot;, was built in the 15th century and heightened in the 16th. It measures around , and the walls are thick at the base. Each storey contains a single large room with a fireplace, a garderobe or privy, and numerous chambers within the walls. The storeys were originally linked by a narrow spiral stair, until a larger stair tower was constructed at the east corner in the 17th century. The castle&#x27;s more important prisoners were held here. Men such as Cardinal Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews and James V&#x27;s ambassador to France, and Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, regent of Scotland in the 1520s, would have had a reasonably high standard of living, including their own servants, while in prison. The basement is vaulted, and the roof is also built on a stone vault. The parapet was rebuilt in the 20th century, although the course of projecting corbels on which it stands is original. Outside the tower is a well.

===Spur===
The 16th-century forework, or &quot;spur&quot;, which provides additional protection for the main gate, is largely the work of Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, and contains numerous defensive features. Originally a rock ditch ran in front of the entrance, and was crossed by a drawbridge. The original 1693 yett, a latticed iron gate, is still in place. Once through the entrance, any attacker would have had to negotiate a dog-leg passage, exposing his back to fire from the caponier. Part of this passage was also exposed to attack from the parapet walk on the upper storey. In the late 17th century, the spur was heightened, and gun batteries added above.

==Modern use==

Since the castle&#x27;s restoration, it has been open to the public as a historic monument. The buildings of the castle stand empty, although there is a small exhibition in the former barracks outside. The castle has been used as a filming location in several productions, including Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990), Bob Carruthers&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Bruce&quot;, and the science-fiction film &quot;Doomsday&quot; (2008). On television, Blackness has featured in the BBC/A&amp;E television mini-series of &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1997), and the Starz series &quot;Outlander&quot;. It was also used as a location for the BBC Scotland historical series &quot;Rise of the Clans&quot;.

<doc id="969016" wikidata="Q632602" url="?curid=969016" title="Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem">
<text>The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, also known as the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, is an autocephalous church within the wider communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. Established in the mid-fifth century as one of the oldest patriarchates in Christendom, it is headquartered in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and led by the patriarch of Jerusalem, currently Theophilos III. The patriarchate&#x27;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction includes roughly 200,000 to 500,000 Orthodox Christians across the Holy Land in Palestine, Jordan and Israel.

The church traces its foundation in Jerusalem to the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit, according to Christian beliefs, descended on the disciples of Jesus Christ and ushered the spread of the Gospel. The church celebrates its liturgy in the ancient Byzantine Rite – whose sacred language, Koine Greek, is the original language of the New Testament – and follows its own liturgical year under the Julian calendar.

The majority of Orthodox Christians under the patriarchate are Palestinians and Jordanians, with minorities of Russians, Romanians, and Georgians. However, the church&#x27;s hierarchy has been dominated by Greek clergy since its creation, which has been a source of recurring tension and dispute. A movement to Arabize the church, known as the Arab Orthodox Movement, began in the 19th century. The church serves as custodian of several holy places in Christianity, including the Church of the Nativity, in Bethlehem, where Jesus is said to have been born, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which includes the traditional site of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and the empty tomb from which he is believed to have resurrected.

==History==


In the Apostolic Age, the early centers of Christianity consisted of an indefinite number of local churches that initially looked to Jerusalem as its main centre and point of reference. Some found their way to Antioch, where they undertook evangelical efforts, and to whom the term &quot;Christians&quot; was first used. Nevertheless, Jerusalem was consistently central to Christianity.

Before the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-73 AD) and the destruction of Herod&#x27;s Temple in 70 by Titus, Christians led by Simeon fled to Pella in Decapolis (Jordan), where they remained until 135.

The Jews of Judea again revolted against Rome in the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136). By or during that time, the Christians had returned to Jerusalem. However, to punish the Jews for their revolt and to prevent further unrest, Jerusalem was made a Roman colony and renamed Aelia Capitolina by Hadrian. In 135, the Metropolitan of Caesarea appointed Marcus as the first bishop of the renamed Church of Aelia Capitolina. He was the first gentile bishop of the Church of Jerusalem (or Aelia Capitolina), all the previous ones having been Jewish. The persecution of Jews by Roman authorities in Judea increased, with most of the Jewish and Christian population of Judea being enslaved and dispersed throughout the Roman Empire. The importance and place of Jerusalem in the life of the Christian Church diminished, though a Jewish and Christian remnant always remained in the city and the land.

Despite the strife, persecutions and meager population, bishops continued to be elected or named. Eusebius of Caesarea provides the names of an unbroken succession of thirty-six Bishops of Jerusalem up to the year 324. The first sixteen of these bishops were Jewish—from James the Just to Judas († 135)—and the remainder were Gentiles. The Metropolitans of Caesarea continued to appoint the bishops of Aelia Capitolina until 325.

At the First Council of Nicaea in 325, though the bishop of Aelia Capitolina was still subordinate to the Metropolitan of Caesarea, the council accorded the bishop a certain undefined precedence in its seventh canon.

In a decree issued from the seventh session of the Fourth Ecumenical Council (the Council of Chalcedon) in 451 the bishop of Jerusalem was elevated to the rank of patriarch, ranked fifth after the sees of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch (see pentarchy). Since then, the Church of Jerusalem has remained an autocephalous church. Jerusalem was established as a patriarchate because of the holiness of the place; the special significance acquired between the first and fourth ecumenical councils; the erection of magnificent churches; the conversion of a large proportion of the population of Roman and Byzantine Syria-Palestina to Christianity; the coming together of pilgrims from around the world; the importance of outstanding bishops, monks, and teachers of the Church of Jerusalem; the struggles of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre on behalf of Orthodoxy; and the support of various emperors of Byzantium.

The Persians occupied Jerusalem in 614 and took Patriarch Zachariah prisoner, along with the palladium of Christianity, the Precious Cross. Chrysostomos Papadopoulos writes in his history of the patriarchate: &quot;The Churches and the monasteries, inside and outside Jerusalem, were destroyed; the Christians were brutally slaughtered … thousands of prisoners purchased by Jews were slaughtered. Anything good that existed was destroyed or was plundered by the invaders. The monks were slaughtered mercilessly, especially those of St Savvas Monastery.&quot;

In 637, after a long siege of Jerusalem, Patriarch Sophronius surrendered Jerusalem to Caliph Umar, but secured the Covenant of Umar I, which recognised Christian rights to protection. In 638, the Armenian Apostolic Church began appointing its own bishop in Jerusalem.

After 638, however, Christians suffered many persecutions. Christian shrines were repeatedly ransacked and defaced by the successors of Umur, and there was great persecution all around. The most deadly persecution occurred during the time of the Fatamid Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (1007–1009), named the &quot;Nero of Egypt&quot; for his merciless acts. He persecuted ferociously both Christians and Jews, ordering that in public Jews were to wear masks representing the head of an ox and bells around their necks; Christians were to wear mourning apparel and crosses one yard in length. Al-Hakim is particularly notorious for ordering the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other holy sites to Christians and Jews. In the eleventh century, the Caliph Ali az-Zahir, under a treaty with Byzantium, permitted the reconstruction of the shrines.

In the Great Schism of 1054, the patriarch of Jerusalem joined those of Antioch, Constantinople and Alexandria as the Eastern Orthodox Church. All Christians in the Holy Land came under the jurisdiction of the Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem.

In 1099, the crusaders captured Jerusalem, setting up the Kingdom of Jerusalem and establishing a Latin hierarchy under a Latin patriarch, and expelling the Orthodox patriarch. The Latin patriarch resided in Jerusalem from 1099 to 1187, while Greek patriarchs continued to be appointed, but resided in Constantinople. In 1187, the Crusaders were forced to flee Jerusalem, and the Orthodox patriarch returned to Jerusalem. The Catholic Church continued to appoint Latin patriarchs, though the office holder resided in Rome until 1847, when they were permitted to return to the Middle East by the Ottoman authorities.

The Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, which is closely linked to the Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, remains the custodian of many of the Christian Holy places in the Holy Land, sometimes jointly with the Roman Catholic Church and the Oriental Churches (Egyptian, Syrian, 
Ethiopian and Armenian Orthodox Christians).


===Recent political controversies===
Theophilos III became patriarch of the church at a very difficult time in its history. The politics of the Middle East and the delicacy of the relations with the Palestinian Authority, Israel and Jordan continues to make the role and place of the patriarch and the patriarchate very challenging.

In 2005, a crisis occurred in the church when Irenaios was deposed as patriarch by the Holy Synod of Jerusalem after having sold church property in East Jerusalem to Israeli investors. On August 22, 2005, the Holy Synod of the Church of Jerusalem unanimously elected Archbishop Theophilos of Tabor as the 141st patriarch of Jerusalem.

For some time the Israeli Government withheld recognition of Theophilos as the new patriarch, and continued to only recognize Irenaios as patriarch. This position has been criticised as defying the unanimous decision by representatives of all Eastern Orthodox churches meeting at the Phanar at the call of the ecumenical patriarch withdrawing communion from Irineos and recognizing Theophilos&#x27;s canonical election.

Israel&#x27;s refusal to recognise the patriarch&#x27;s temporal role inhibited the patriarch&#x27;s ability to take the Israeli government to court, and froze patriarchal bank accounts. This in turn threatened the maintenance of the Holy Places and the patriarchate school system with 40,000 students. It has been alleged that the origins of the dispute are part of a forty-year attempt by Israeli settler organizations and politicians to open up the patriarchate&#x27;s extensive land holdings worth estimated hundreds of millions of dollars. 

In 2006, Israel refused to renew visas of many of the Greek clergy, which threatened to create to a serious crisis within the church, as most of the monks are Greek citizens. Patriarch Theophilos applied to the Israeli Supreme Court. A decision was due in mid-2006 and then in January 2007, but the Israeli government repeatedly requested further delays in the case. The Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported on 11 February 2007 that the Israeli government offered to recognize Theophilos if he would give up control of several valuable properties and sell church property only to Israelis.

In May 2007, the government of Jordan revoked its previous recognition of Theophilos III, but on 12 June 2007 the Jordanian cabinet reversed its decision and announced that it had once again officially recognised Theophilos as patriarch. Archbishop Theodosios (Hanna) of Sebastia has also called for a boycott of Theophilos.

In December 2007, the Israeli government finally granted Theophilos full recognition.

The dominance of ethnic Greeks in the Church&#x27;s hierarchy excludes the Arab majority from its upper ranks. This has been a point of endless contention within the church and among its outside supporters, with the Greeks backed by the Greek government, Israel, and the Turkey-based Ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople, in opposition to the native Palestinian clergy, some of whom seek to nationalize the church&#x27;s leadership.

==Land holdings==
The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem is the second biggest owner of land in Israel, after only the Israeli government. The Greek Church purchased most of its lands from the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century. In the 1950s, shortly after Israel’s independence, the Greek Patriarchate agreed to lease most of its lands in Israel to the Israeli government for 99 years, with an option to extend. Even Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, was built on lands owned by the Greek Orthodox Church.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate&#x27;s properties also include historic buildings in Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City, including the Imperial and Petra hotels, inside the Jaffa Gate of the Old City, as well as extensive areas in the Palestinian territories.

In 2005, it was revealed that then patriarch Irenaios had sold lands owned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in East Jerusalem to Jews who seek to increase their presence in what is a predominantly Arab area. The majority of Orthodox Christians in Jerusalem identify as Palestinians, and the sale of lands to Israelis caused a major uproar, which resulted in Irenaios being ousted as patriarch.

==Arab Orthodox Movement==
A political and social movement aiming for the Arabization of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, known as the Arab Orthodox Movement, started in the 19th century.

The movement began within the context of rising Arab nationalism, inspired by 19th-century nationalist movements in the Balkans, which merged demands for religious reforms and national emancipation under the Ottoman Empire, and the successful Arabization of Syria and Lebanon&#x27;s Antioch Patriarchate in 1899. It demands the appointment of an Arab patriarch, Arab laity control over Jerusalem patriarchate&#x27;s properties for social and educational purposes, and the use of the Arabic as a liturgical language. Initially a church movement among Palestine and Transjordan&#x27;s Orthodox Arab Christians, it was later supported as a Palestinian and Arab nationalist cause and championed by Arab Muslims, owing to the Greek-dominated patriarchate&#x27;s early support to Zionism.

The Arab Orthodox laity maintains that the patriarchate was forcibly Hellenized in 1543, while the Greek clergy counters by saying that the patriarchate was historically Greek. Opposition to the Greek clergy started violent in the 19th century, when they came under physical attack by the Arab laity in the streets. There were historically also several interventions to solve the conflict by the Ottoman, British (1921-1948), and Jordanian (1948-1967) authorities, owing to the patriarchate&#x27;s headquarters being located in East Jerusalem. Despite the city coming under Israeli occupation since 1967, the patriarchate has continued to function according to a 1958 Jordanian law, which mandates the clergy hold Jordanian citizenship and speak Arabic.

To this day, the patriarchate continues to be dominated by Greek clergy, and continues to own vast properties that make it the second largest landowner in Israel. In recent decades, lawsuits have ensued in Israeli courts between the Arab laity and the patriarchate over ownership of properties, and land sales by the patriarchate to Israeli investors has led to several controversies, the most recent of which led to the dismissal of patriarch Irenaios in 2005. The patriarch&#x27;s total control over the patriarchate and its vast properties has led to it being described as resembling &quot;small absolute kingdom&quot;.

==Administration and Hierarchy of the Throne==
Head of the Patriarchate and of the Holy Synod is Patriarch Theophilos III (Ilias Giannopoulos), Patriarch of the Holy City of Jerusalem and all Palestine, Israel, Syria, beyond the Jordan River, Cana of Galilee and Holy Zion.

<text>Arthrogryposis (AMC) describes congenital joint contracture in two or more areas of the body. It derives its name from Greek, literally meaning &#x27;curving of joints&#x27; (&#x27;, &#x27;joint&#x27;;&#x27;, late Latin form of late Greek &quot;&quot;, &#x27;hooking&#x27;).

Children born with one or more joint contractures have abnormal fibrosis of the muscle tissue causing muscle shortening, and therefore are unable to perform active extension and flexion in the affected joint or joints.

AMC has been divided into three groups: amyoplasia, distal arthrogryposis, and syndromic (is a syndrome or part of a syndrome). Amyoplasia is characterized by severe joint contractures and muscle weakness. Distal arthrogryposis mainly involves the hands and feet. Types of arthrogryposis with a primary neurological or muscle disease belong to the syndromic group.

==Signs and symptoms==
Often, every joint in a patient with arthrogryposis is affected; in 84% all limbs are involved, in 11% only the legs, and in 4% only the arms are involved. Every joint in the body, when affected, displays typical signs and symptoms: for example, the shoulder (internal rotation); wrist (volar and ulnar); hand (fingers in fixed flexion and thumb in palm); hip (flexed, abducted and externally rotated, frequently dislocated); elbow (extension and pronation) and foot clubfoot and less commonly congenital vertical talus.

Range of motion can be different between joints because of the different deviations. Some types of arthrogryposis like amyoplasia have a symmetrical joint/limb involvement, with normal sensations. The contractures in the joints can result in delayed walking development in the first five years, but severity of contractures do not necessarily predict eventual walking ability or inability.

Intelligence is normal to above normal in children with amyoplasia, but it is not known how many of these children have an above-normal intelligence, and there is no literature available about the cause of this syndrome. There are a few syndromes like the Freeman–Sheldon and Gordon syndrome, which have craniofacial involvement. The amyoplasia form of arthrogryposis is sometimes accompanied with a midline facial hemangioma.
Arthrogryposis is not a diagnosis but a clinical finding, so this disease is often accompanied with other syndromes or diseases. These other diagnoses could affect any organ in a patient. There are a few slightly more common diagnoses such as pulmonary hypoplasia, cryptorchidism, congenital heart defects, tracheoesophageal fistulas, inguinal hernias, cleft palate, and eye abnormalities.

==Causes==

Research of arthrogryposis has shown that anything that inhibits normal joint movement before birth can result in joint contractures. Arthrogryposis could be caused by genetic and environmental factors. In principle: any factor that curtails fetal movement can result in congenital contractures. The exact causes of arthrogryposis are unknown.

===Extrinsic factors===
The malformations of arthrogryposis can be secondary to environmental factors such as: decreased intrauterine movement, oligohydramnios (low volume or abnormal distribution of intrauterine fluid), and defects in the fetal blood supply. Other causes could be: hyperthermia, limb immobilization and viral infections. A specific virus that may cause arthrogryposis is contraction of the Zika virus during pregnancy. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), may occur when there is vertical transmission of the Zika virus to the fetus. Myasthenia gravis of the mother leads also in rare cases to arthrogryposis. The major cause in humans is fetal akinesia; however, this is disputed lately.

===Intrinsic factors===
Arthrogryposis could also be caused by intrinsic factors. This includes molecular, muscle- and connective tissue development disorders or neurological abnormalities.

===Molecular basis===
Research has shown that there are more than 35 specific genetic disorders associated with arthrogryposis. Most of those mutations are missense, which means the mutation results in a different amino acid. Other mutations that could cause arthrogryposis are: single gene defects (X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant), mitochondrial defects and chromosomal disorders (for example: trisomy 18). This is mostly seen in distal arthrogryposis. Mutations in at least five genes (TNN12, TNNT3, TPM2, MYH3 and MYH8) could cause distal arthrogryposis. There could be also connective tissue, neurological or muscle development disorders.

===Muscle and connective tissue development disorders===
Loss of muscle mass with an imbalance of muscle power at the joint can lead to connective tissue abnormality. This leads to joint fixation and reduced fetal movement. Also muscle abnormalities could lead to a reduction of fetal movement.
Those could be: dystrophy, myopathy and mitochondrial disorders. This is mostly the result of abnormal function of the dystrophin-glycoprotein-associated complex in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles.

===Neurological abnormalities===
Seventy to eighty percent of cases of the most severe forms of arthrogryposis are caused by neurological abnormalities, which can be either genetic or environmental.

The underlying aetiology and pathogenesis of congenital contractures, particularly arthrogryposis and the mechanism of the mutations remains an active area of investigation, because identifying these factors could help to develop treatment and congenital finding of arthrogryposis.

==Diagnosis==
Research on prenatal diagnosis has shown that a diagnosis can be made prenatally in approximately 50% of fetuses presenting arthrogryposis. It could be found during routine ultrasound scanning showing a lack of mobility and abnormal position of the foetus. There are other options for visualization of details and structures using techniques such as 4D ultrasound. In clinic a child can be diagnosed with arthrogryposis with physical examination, confirmed by ultrasound, MRI, or muscle biopsy.

===Classification===
Some of the different types of AMC include:
* Arthrogryposis multiplex due to muscular dystrophy.
* Arthrogryposis ectodermal dysplasia other anomalies, also known as Cote Adamopoulos Pantelakis syndrome, Trichooculodermovertebral syndrome, TODV syndrome and Alves syndrome.
* Arthrogryposis epileptic seizures migrational brain disorder.
* Arthrogryposis IUGR thoracic dystrophy, also known as Van Bervliet syndrome.
* Arthrogryposis-like disorder, also known as Kuskokwim disease.
* Arthrogryposis-like hand anomaly and sensorineural deafness.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita CNS calcification.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita distal (AMCD), also known as X-linked spinal muscular atrophy type 2.
* Gordon syndrome, also known as distal arthrogryposis type 3.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 2A, also known as Freeman–Sheldon syndrome.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 2B, also known as Sheldon–Hall syndrome.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita neurogenic type (AMCN). This particular type of AMC has been linked to the AMCN gene on locus 5q35.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita pulmonary hypoplasia, also with a large number of synonyms.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita whistling face, also known as Illum syndrome.
* Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 (AMCD1).
* Arthrogryposis multiplex with deafness, inguinal hernias, and early death. This syndrome is suspected to be inherited in an X-linked or autosomal recessive fashion. There were only three reported cases with all three patients dead.
* Arthrogryposis ophthalmoplegia retinopathy, also known as Oculomelic amyoplasia.
* Arthrogryposis renal dysfunction cholestasis syndrome, also known as ARC Syndrome.

Another form has been related to mutations in the leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 4 (LGI4) gene.

==Treatment==

The treatment of arthrogryposis includes occupational therapy, physical therapy, splinting and surgery. An approach that occupational therapists use is orthopedic management. Using casts in order to correct joint deformities can be very effective since the joints can be misaligned and present with deformities. Another vital intervention that occupational therapists use to treat arthrogryposis, is range of motion exercises. This is in order to increase joint mobility. The primary long-term goals of these treatments are increasing joint mobility and muscle strength and the development of adaptive use patterns that allow for walking and independence with activities of daily living. Since arthrogryposis has many different types, the treatment varies between patients depending on the symptoms.

=== Passive enhancement ===
There are a number of passive devices for enhancing limb movement, intended to be worn to aid movement and encourage muscular development. For example, the Wilmington Robotic Exoskeleton is a potential assistive device built on a back brace, shadowing the upper arm and forearm. It can be difficult to fit and heavy and awkward to wear.

Researchers at the University of Delaware are developing a light and unobtrusive therapeutic garment, suitable for babies and children, called the Playskin Lift. The garment looks like normal clothing but contains bundled steel wires under the arms, which help to push the arms toward a lifted position while allowing the wearer to move freely from that position.

===Wrist surgery===
Children with the amyoplasia type of arthrogryposis usually have flexion and ulnar deviation of the wrists. Dorsal carpal wedge osteotomy is indicated for wrists with excessive flexion contracture deformity when non-surgical interventions such as occupational therapy and splinting have failed to improve function. On the dorsal side, at the level of the midcarpus, a wedge osteotomy is made. Sufficient bone is resected to at least be able to put the wrist in a neutral position. If the wrist also has ulnar deviation, more bone can be taken from the radial side to correct this abnormality. This position is held into place with two cross K-wires. In addition, a tendon transfer of the extensor carpi ulnaris to the extensor carpi radialis brevis may be performed to correct ulnar deviation or wrist extension weakness, or both. This tendon transfer is only used if the extensor carpi ulnaris appears to be functional enough.

===Thumb surgery===

The soft tissue envelope in congenital contractual conditions such as clasped or arthrogrypotic thumbs is often deficient in two planes, the thumb-index web and the flexor aspect of the thumb. There is often an appearance of increased skin at the base of the index finger that is part of the deformity. This tissue can be used to resurface the thumb-index web after a comprehensive release of all the tight structures to allow for a larger range of motion of the thumb. This technique is called the index rotation flap.

The flap is taken from the radial side of the index finger. It is proximally based at the distal edge of the thumb-index web. The flap is made as wide as possible, but still small enough to close with the excessive skin on the palmar side of the index finger. The flap is rotated around the tightest part of the thumb to the metacarpophalangeal joint of the thumb, allowing for a larger range of motion.

===Foot surgeries===
Generally, foot surgery is usually reserved for patients with a walking or ambulatory potential. Foot surgery may also be indicated to assist brace and orthosis fitting and hence promote supported standing. The most common foot deformity in arthrogryposis is club feet or talipes equinovarus. In the early years of life the serial casting according to the Ponseti method usually yields good results. The Ponseti method can also be used as a first line treatment in older and more resistant cases. In such severe and neglected cases bony surgery in the form of foot osteotomies and arthrodesis is usually indicated. It is usually accompanied by soft tissue surgery in the form of release of contracted tendon and capsular structures. In older patients near skeletal maturity joint fusion or arthrodesis may be indicated as well. Less frequent patients with arthrogryposis may develop congenital vertical talus also known as rocker bottom foot. Similarly, congenital vertical talus is classically managed by serial casting according to the reversed Ponseti method. Resistant or recurrent cases may be offered an extensive soft tissue release. However this is fraught with risk of foot stiffness and pain in the long term. Talectomy or excision of the talus to give room for creation of plantigrade foot has been practiced. Naviculectomy or midtarsal resection arthroplasty represents a less invasive option with satisfactory short-term results.
==Prognosis==
AMC is considered non-progressive, so with proper medical treatment things can improve. The joint contractures will not get worse than they are at the time of birth. There is no way to resolve or cure AMC completely but with proper treatment most children make significant improvements in their range of motion and ability to move their limbs, which enables them to carry out daily activities and live relatively normal lives.

Therapeutic interventions that are cornerstones in the treatment of AMC include: stretching and range of motion exercises, physical, occupational and speech therapy, splinting and serial casting. Surgical intervention may also improve joint mobility and function. Other positive prognostic factors for independent walking are active hips and knees, hip flexion contractures of less than 20 degrees and knee flexion contractures of less than 15 degrees without severe scoliosis.

==Epidemiology==
Arthrogryposis is a rare condition. Some authors say the overall prevalence is one in 3,000 and others say it is one in 11,000–12,000 among European live births. Congenital clubfoot is the most common single contracture and its prevalence is one in 500 live births.

<text>The Royal 22nd Regiment (R22R; ) is an infantry regiment of the Canadian Army. Known colloquially in English as the Van Doos (representing an anglicized pronunciation of the French number twenty-two, ) or in French as , the mostly francophone regiment comprises three Regular Force battalions, two Primary Reserve battalions, and a band, making it the largest regiment in the Canadian Army. The headquarters () of the regiment is at the Citadelle of Quebec in Quebec City, also the site of the regimental museum, and all three of its regular battalions are stationed at Canadian Forces Base Valcartier in Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier, outside of Quebec City. The regiment is a &quot;British-style&quot; infantry regiment that is the spiritual home and repository of customs and traditions for a number of battalions that do not necessarily serve together operationally. It serves as the &quot;local&quot; infantry regiment for the province of Quebec, where it draws most of its recruits; it is the largest regiment in the province, in terms of numbers.

==History==

While the Royal 22e Régiment commemorates the history and traditions of the Canadian Regiment of Fencible Infantry from the War of 1812 (also carrying resultant battle honours from the War of 1812), the modern ancestor of the regiment was formed in the early days of the First World War as part of the British Army, when volunteers from all over Canada were being massed for training at Valcartier, Québec, just outside Quebec City. The first contingent of 30,000 volunteers, which became the 1st Canadian Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, were grouped into numbered battalions, regardless of origin. The existing reserve regiments were not mobilized, due to the belief of the Defence Minister, Sam Hughes, that a new &quot;efficient&quot; structure was required. Once again the new structure did not contain French-speaking units, such as those that had existed in the reserves. Over 1000 French-Canadian volunteers were scattered into different English-speaking units. This was not an oversight as Ontario (Hughes&#x27;s political base) was in the process of outlawing both the teaching of French, as well as in the French language in their school system (Regulation 17) The predictable outrage in French Canada created a lack of support for the war of &quot;King and Country&quot;, perceived as a mechanism to entirely annihilate the Francophone community in Canada.

The second contingent was more logically based on battalions raised and trained in the various military districts in which they were recruited, but remained using an impersonal numerical basis (with the exception of those with a Highland or Irish identity). Considerable political pressure in Quebec, along with public rallies, demanded the creation of French-speaking units to fight a war many viewed as being right and necessary, despite Regulation 17 in Ontario.

In September 1914, French Canadian pharmaceutical entrepreneur Arthur Mignault communicated with Prime Minister Robert Borden, advocating the formation of a solely French Canadian regiment. Mignault offered the government $50,000 to pursue this end. Borden had recently committed Canada to provide half a million soldiers to the Allied cause, and was just realising how demanding it would be to honour this promise. Borden eagerly accepted Mignault&#x27;s proposal and accordingly, on 14 October 1914, the 22nd Battalion (French Canadian), CEF, was authorized. Mignault participated in the recruitment campaign, which resulted in a remarkable success; the ranks of the battalion were filled in less than a month. Arthur Mignault is as such considered the founder of the 22nd regiment.

The 22nd went to France as part of the 5th Canadian Brigade and the 2nd Canadian Division in September 1915, and fought with distinction in every major Canadian engagement until the end of the war. While other French speaking units were also created, they were all broken up upon arrival in France to provide reinforcements for the 22nd, which suffered close to 4000 wounded and killed in the course of the war. Two members of the 22nd were awarded the Victoria Cross in that war, Lieutenant Jean Brillant and Corporal Joseph Kaeble.
After the war, the 22nd Battalion was disbanded on 20 May 1919, sharing the fate of other numbered battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. However, in the post-war reorganizations of the army, public pressure, such as resolutions by the Legislative Assembly of Quebec as well as the City Council of Quebec City, demanded that a permanent French-language unit be created in the peace-time Regular Force, and accordingly a new regiment was created, made up of veterans of the 22nd Battalion, on 1 April 1920. Initially the regiment, which was given the guard of the Citadelle of Quebec, was simply the &quot;22nd Regiment&quot;, but in June 1921 King George V approved the renaming of it as &quot;The Royal 22nd Regiment&quot;. In 1928, the anomaly of a French-language unit with an English name was resolved, and the regiment became the &quot;Royal 22e Régiment&quot; in both languages. While in the Canadian Armed Forces, unit names are generally translated into the language of a text, traditional combat arms regiments are identified only in the single language of their troops, either English or French. However, the English version of the R22eR is still seen occasionally, but strictly speaking it is incorrect; only &quot;Royal 22e Régiment&quot; has been official in either language since 1928.

In 1940, the regiment became the first Francophone Canadian unit to mount the King&#x27;s Guard in London and was the first of the three current Regular Force infantry regiments to do so.
In the Second World War, the regiment was part of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade and the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and was involved in intense combat in Italy, (where Captain Paul Triquet earned the Victoria Cross) and later in the Netherlands and northwest Germany.

During the Korean War, 1951–1953, the regiment expanded to three battalions, each serving in turn as part of the Canadian brigade in the 1st Commonwealth Division. Thus the &quot;Van Doos&quot; represented one-third of Canada&#x27;s infantry contingent throughout the war.

During the Cold War the regular battalions of the regiment served, in turn, in West Germany as part of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, with the 1er Battalion serving permanently from 1967 until the withdrawal in 1993.

The regiment also served during the Oka Crisis. During the life of the Canadian Airborne Regiment (1968–1995) the 1er Commando was manned as a French-speaking sub-unit by soldiers of the Royal 22nd Regiment.

In the 1950s, the Canadian Army promoted a scheme of administratively associating reserve infantry regiments with a regular one. Although this project did not make much progress in most of the army, three reserve regiments did join the Van Doos, becoming battalions of the Royal 22e Régiment:


In the case of Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent, the battalion designation was in a subsidiary title, but it became nevertheless, administratively, part of the Royal 22e Régiment. However, in 1968, Les Fusiliers du St-Laurent dropped the subsidiary title, and ended their administrative association with the R22eR.

Three battalions of the Royal 22e Régiment served in the Republic of Korea as part of the 25th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 1st Commonwealth Division. The 2nd Battalion formed as part of the Special Force was the first to arrive in Korea, serving there from 4 May 1951 to 24 April 1952, followed by the 1st Battalion from 20 April 1952 to 21 April 1953 then the 3rd Battalion from 16 April 1953 to the Armistice on 27 July 1953.

===Oka Crisis===
In the summer of 1990, the Attorney General of Quebec requisitioned the Canadian Armed Forces, including the Van Doos, to challenge Mohawk activists and warriors in Kanehsatà꞉ke and Kahnawake in a confrontation called the Oka Crisis.

===Gulf War===
&#x27;C&#x27; Company from the 1st Battalion, then based at CFB Lahr in West Germany as part of 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group, served in Doha, Qatar, providing airfield security from 24 December 1990 to the end of March 1991.

=== Afghanistan ===

The 3rd Battalion, along with an attached mechanized company from the 1st, provided the basis for the Canadian ISAF contingent in Kabul, Afghanistan, from February to August 2004.

In August 2007 the battle group based on the 3rd Battalion of the Royal 22e Régiment returned to Afghanistan, replacing the 2nd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment in Kandahar province. This battle group was made up of a company from each of the regiment&#x27;s three regular battalions. It also included combat support and service support from all the units of 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group in Valcartier, Quebec. There was a reconnaissance squadron from the 12e Régiment blindé du Canada, a composite tank squadron from Lord Strathcona&#x27;s Horse (with troops from the other two armoured regiments), a battery from the 5e Régiment d&#x27;artillerie légère du Canada, an engineer squadron from 5 Combat Engineer Regiment. The battle group, awarded the Commander-in-Chief Unit Commendation, was &quot;instrumental in dismantling improvised explosive device networks, re-capturing checkpoints and returning them to Afghan control, enhancing the capacity of Afghan forces and providing guidance on community building and local governance&quot;.

The Royal 22nd Regiment also provided about 150 trainers (in Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs)) for the three Afghan &quot;Kandaks&quot; serving with them. As well it provided a protection company for the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Kandahar.

The regiment distinguished itself in Kandahar through its determined and successful efforts to establish Afghan police sub-stations, protected by Afghan National Army and Canadian presence, in an ever-widening secure zone in the former Taliban home districts of Zhari and Panjawaii. Light infantry elements often fought toe-to-toe with the Taliban, relying heavily on sniper fire and man-portable grenade launchers to gain the edge over the militants. The battle group, and its associated OMLT and PRT elements, had 10 men killed in action during the six-month tour. The many wounded included Captain Simon Mailloux, a Van Doos platoon commander who returned two years later to Kandahar even though his leg had to be amputated.

A second Van Doos battle group, this time based on the 2nd Battalion, deployed to Kandahar from March to November 2009 and was the vanguard of the much-vaunted &quot;key villages&quot; program, wherein Canadian soldiers cleared urban areas of Taliban activity during sweeping combat operations and then installed sub-units permanently in those hamlets, guarding the approaches to Kandahar City. The composition of this battle group was nearly identical to previous incarnations, and it was able to rely heavily on the recently deployed CH-146 Griffon and CH-47 Chinook helicopters to perform a wide variety of airmobile operations, as well as traditional mechanized manoeuvres. The Griffon helicopters proved especially capable at spotting Taliban movements and directing accurate artillery fire on them, preventing Taliban groups from effectively re-infiltrating areas previously cleared.

Over the course of the seven-month Rotation 7, ten soldiers from the battle group were killed in action (&quot;Rotation 7&quot; denoting that this was the eighth consecutive Canadian battle group deployment in Kandahar since 2006, as rotations are numbered starting at &quot;0&quot;). Five additional Canadian soldiers, all belonging to the battle group&#x27;s parent organization, Task Force Kandahar, also died during that period. The vast majority of these soldiers were killed by the Taliban&#x27;s lethal employment of anti-vehicle or anti-personnel improvised explosive devices.

The final Canadian combat mission began in the fall of 2010 with the 1st Battalion Battle Group (BG) commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Michel-Henri St. Louis. One of the main operations taken on by the BG was Operation Baawar beginning in December 2010 featuring a major road project and a strongpoint construction project led by engineers, tanks, and infantry.

==Memorials==
A stone shaft was erected on the grounds of Royal Military College Saint-Jean on 26 September 1964 to commemorate the founding of the Royal 22nd Regiment; the regiment trained at Fort Saint-Jean in 1914. The monument lists the regiment&#x27;s battle honours.

&quot;Je me souviens&quot; (1989) by André Gauthier, a bronze haut-relief bronze and granite wall memorial, was erected at Place George V in front of the Grande Allée Armoury in Quebec City. Unveiled on 11 November 1989, the sculpture honours the memory of the soldiers from the Royal 22e Régiment who were killed during the First and Second World Wars and the Korean War. The sculptor was inspired by A.T.C. Bastiens&#x27; painting &quot;L&#x27;Avance&quot; at the Canadian War Museum. The names of soldiers are inscribed in granite on the monument.

There is a group of 28 gravestones of members of the Royal 22e Régiment who died between 1929 and 1960 in the Notre Dame de Belmont Cemetery in Quebec City. Four gravestones, dated 1929, 1935, 1938, 1938 feature a crown, beaver and regimental motto. Seven gravestones, dated 1939, 1941, 1941, 1942, 1942, 1942, 1947 feature the Maple Leaf and Canadian Forces cross. Seven gravestones feature the Canadian Forces cross dated 1954, 1954, 1955, 1955, 1955, 1954, 1960.

On 9 November 2011, the film was previewed for the families of 26 soldiers who had died during their mission in Afghanistan, at a ceremony at the Valcartier base. A commemorative mural by Canadian artist Dave Sopha was also unveiled.

&quot;Hyena Road&quot; is a 2015 Canadian war drama film shown in the Gala Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The title comes from built in Afghanistan in 2010–2011 by 1 R22eR Battle Group.

==Possible specialist Arctic sovereignty role==
It has been suggested in some Canadian professional military journals that the regiment&#x27;s third battalion (3 R22eR) could be adapted to become a specialist amphibious battalion or a specialized light infantry battalion that is able to deploy parachute infantry and marine infantry company groups to support the protection of Canada&#x27;s sovereignty in the Arctic.

<text>Ladyfingers or Naples biscuits, in British English sponge fingers, also known by the Italian name &#x27; () or by the French name &#x27; (), are low-density, dry, egg-based, sweet sponge cake biscuits roughly shaped like large fingers. They are a principal ingredient in many dessert recipes, such as trifles and charlottes, and are also used as fruit or chocolate gateau linings, and for the sponge element of tiramisu. They are typically soaked in a sugar syrup or liqueur, or in espresso for tiramisu.

==History==

Ladyfingers are said to have originated in the 14th century at the court of the County of Savoy, and were created to mark the occasion of a visit by the King of France. They were particularly appreciated by the younger members of the court and offered to visitors as an example of the local cuisine.

==Preparation==

Like other sponge cakes, ladyfingers traditionally contain no chemical leavening agent, and rely on air incorporated into the eggs for their &quot;sponge&quot; texture. Some brands, however, contain ammonium bicarbonate. The egg whites and egg yolks mixed with sugar are typically beaten separately and folded together with flour. They contain more flour than the typical sponge cake. The mixture is piped through a pastry bag in short lines onto sheets, giving the biscuits their notable shape.

Before baking, powdered sugar is usually sifted over the top to give a soft crust. The finished ladyfingers are usually layered into a dessert such as tiramisu or trifle.

<text>The Shark Trust is a charitable organization founded in the United Kingdom in 1997. It is dedicated to promoting the study, management and conservation of sharks, skates and rays (elasmobranchs) in the UK and internationally.

TheTrust works on various projects. With a specific focus on collaborating and working with fishers, fisheries management organisations, scientists, conservationists and other third-sector organisations. The Trust has produced codes of conduct for approaching basking sharks and whale sharks safely and responsibly. It also campaigns for legislative protection of vulnerable shark species and for tighter legislation restricting shark finning.

The Shark Trust holds outreach and engagement events for the public. One of the biggest projects is The Great Eggcase Hunt. This project empowers the public to find shark, skate and ray eggcases on their beach and log them. The data is used to monitor species distribution.

<text>Messier 94 (also known as NGC 4736, Cat&#x27;s Eye Galaxy, Crocodile Eye Galaxy, or Croc&#x27;s Eye Galaxy) is a spiral galaxy in the mid-northern constellation Canes Venatici. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781,
and catalogued by Charles Messier two days later. Although some references describe M94 as a barred spiral galaxy, the &quot;bar&quot; structure appears to be more oval-shaped. The galaxy has two ring structures.

==Structure==

M94 is classified as having a low ionization nuclear emission region (LINER) nucleus. LINERs in general are characterized by optical spectra that reveal that ionized gas is present but the gas is only weakly ionized (i.e. the atoms are missing relatively few electrons).

M94 has an inner ring with a diameter of 70 arcseconds (″) (given its distance, about ) and an outer ring with a diameter of 600″ (about ). These rings appear to form at resonance points in the disk of the galaxy. The inner ring is the site of strong star formation activity and is sometimes referred to as a starburst ring. This star formation is fueled by gas driven dynamically into the ring by the inner oval-shaped bar-like structure.

A 2009 study conducted by an international team of astrophysicists revealed that the outer ring of M94 is not a closed stellar ring, as historically attributed in the literature, but a complex structure of spiral arms when viewed in mid-IR and UV. The study found that the outer disk of this galaxy is active. It contains approximately 23% of the galaxy&#x27;s total stellar mass and contributes about 10% of the galaxy&#x27;s new stars. In fact, the star formation rate of the outer disk is approximately two times greater than the inner disk because it is more efficient per unit of stellar mass.

There are several possible external events that could have led to the origin of M94&#x27;s outer disk including the accretion of a satellite galaxy or the gravitational interaction with a nearby star system. However, further research found problems with each of these scenarios. Therefore, the report concludes that the inner disk of M94 is an oval distortion which led to the creation of this galaxy&#x27;s peripheral disk.

In a paper published in 2004, John Kormendy and Robert Kennicutt argued that M94 contains a prototypical pseudobulge. A classical spiral galaxy consists of a disk of gas and young stars that intersects a large sphere (or bulge) of older stars. In contrast, a galaxy with a pseudobulge does not have a large bulge of old stars but instead contain a bright central structure with intense star formation that looks like a bulge when the galaxy is viewed face-on. In the case of M94, this pseudobulge takes the form of a ring around a central oval-shaped region.

In 2008 a study was published showing that M94 had very little or no dark matter present. The study analyzed the rotation curves of the galaxy&#x27;s stars and the density of hydrogen gas and found that ordinary luminous matter appeared to account for all of the galaxy&#x27;s mass. This result was unusual and somewhat controversial, as current models do not indicate how a galaxy could form without a dark matter halo or how a galaxy could lose its dark matter. Other explanations for galactic rotation curves, such as MOND, also have difficulty explaining this galaxy. This result has yet to be confirmed or accepted by other research groups, however, and has not actually been tested against the predictions of standard galaxy formation models.

==Location==

At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to M94. The surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to M94 using this technique is 17.0 ± 1.4 Mly (5.2 ± 0.4 Mpc). However, M94 is close enough that the Hubble Space Telescope can be used to resolve and measure the fluxes of the brightest individual stars within the galaxy. These measured fluxes can then be compared to the measured fluxes of similar stars within the Milky Way to measure the distance. The estimated distance to M94 using this technique is 15 ± 2 Mly (4.7 ± 0.6 Mpc). Averaged together, these distance measurements give a distance estimate of 16.0 ± 1.3 Mly (4.9 ± 0.4 Mpc).

M94 is one of the brightest galaxies within the M94 Group, a group of galaxies that contains between 16 and 24 galaxies. This group is one of many that lie within the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster). Although a large number of galaxies may be associated with M94, only a few galaxies near M94 appear to form a gravitationally bound system. Most of the other nearby galaxies appear to be moving with the expansion of the universe.

<text>Margie Adam (born 1947) is an American musician and composer.

==Early life and education==
Margie Adam was born in 1947 in Lompoc, California. Her father was a newspaper publisher who composed music on the side, and her mother was a classical pianist. Adam began playing the piano as a child. Adam graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1971.

In 1973, while attending the Sacramento Women&#x27;s Music Festival, she performed during the open mic session and began her career as a professional musician. The following year, the first National Women&#x27;s Music Festival was held in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois. Adam co-headlined the festival, alongside Meg Christian and Cris Williamson. That conference is credited as helping to form the Women&#x27;s music movement, with Adam at the forefront.

==Music career==
Her first album, &quot;Margie Adam&quot;, was promoted with a 50-city tour which concluded with a performance of her song, &quot;We Shall Go Forth&quot; at the National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston. The song quickly became an anthem for the lesbian feminist movement and is now part of the Political History archives in the Smithsonian Museum. In 1978, became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Adam During the early 1980s, Adam performed at various concerts and fundraisers for feminist candidates and causes, including representatives for the Equal Rights Amendment, for whom she traveled on a 20-city tour.

Adam composed &quot;Best Friend (The Unicorn Song)&quot;, which was later covered by Peter, Paul and Mary. A Cantonese version of the song was also released by Hong Kong singer George Lam in 1984. From 1975 to 1984, Adam worked with manager and music producer Barbara Price, promoting women&#x27;s music and releasing her own albums on Pleiades Records. Adam challenged conventional management practices by having all-women crews during her performances and tours. After being on a &quot;radical sabbatical,&quot; since 1984, Adam returned to writing music in 1991 and went on a national tour in 1992 to support her new album, &quot;Another Place&quot;. In 1996 she embarked on the Three of Hearts tour with fellow pianists Liz Story and Barbara Higbie. In 1998, she conducted a tour to raise awareness of the service feminist bookstores made to the women&#x27;s community.

Margie Adam continues to compose and perform at various venues across the U.S. and Canada. More recent work includes &quot;The Best of Margie Adam&quot; (1990), &quot;Avalon&quot; (2001), and &quot;Portal&quot; 2005.

<text>Landguard Fort is a fort at the mouth of the River Orwell outside Felixstowe, Suffolk, designed to guard the mouth of the river. It is now managed by the charity English Heritage and is open to the public.

==History==

Originally known as Langer Fort, the first fortifications from 1540 were a few earthworks and blockhouse, but it was King James I who ordered, from 1621, the construction of a square fort with bulwarks at each corner.
In 1667, the Dutch, under Michiel de Ruyter, landed a force of 2,000 men on Felixstowe beach in front of (what is now called) Undercliff Road East and advanced on to the fort, but were repulsed by Nathaniel Darrel and his garrison of 400 musketeers of the Duke of York &amp; Albany&#x27;s Maritime Regiment (the first Royal Marines) and 100 artillerymen with 54 cannon.

The fort was considered part of Essex in the 18th and 19th centuries; births and deaths within the garrison were recorded as &#x27;Landguard Fort, Essex&#x27;.

A new Fort battery was built in 1717, and a complete new fort on an adjoining site was started in 1745 to a pentagonal bastioned trace. New batteries were built in the 1750s and 1780s. The biggest change occurred in the 1870s when the interior barracks were rebuilt to a keep-like design and the river frontage was rebuilt with a new casemated battery covered by a very unusual caponier with a quarter-sphere bombproof nose. Several open bastions were enclosed, and a mock ravelin block was constructed to house a submarine mining contingent.

Two landscapes were commissioned, c.1755, from Thomas Gainsborough - then still little-known and living at Ipswich (1750-9) - for the Governor&#x27;s Quarters at Landguard by his friend Philip Thicknesse, Lt. Governor of Landguard Fort. These were later destroyed by the damp conditions at the Fort, but an engraving of one of them survives.

In the Napoleonic Wars, the strength and combat readiness of the Fort caused the Army repeated concern. In 1801, General Lord Cornwallis, Eastern District commander-in-chief visited Landguard Fort. After 1804 steps were taken to extend and strengthen the Fort with the supply and ammunition stores moved across to Harwich for safety. The badly-disciplined garrison had drunk gin found on a captured smugglers&#x27; boat leading to the death of four soldiers, probably from alcohol poisoning.

During the Second World War, Landguard Fort was used as one of the launch sites of Operation Outward. This was a project to attack Germany by means of free-flying hydrogen balloons that carried incendiary devices or trailing steel wires (intended to damage power lines.) Between 1942 and 1944, many thousands of balloons were launched.

The main uses of the Fort and nearby structures were:

* Headquarters for the coast artillery guns defending Harwich Harbour. In 1944 radar was installed for their fire control. By 1941 4 6-inch and 2 twin six-pounder guns were operational on the Landguard Peninsula, housed in concrete emplacements which still remain;
* Headquarters and Plot Room for the heavy anti-aircraft defending the Harwich-Ipswich area. This function was moved to Martello Tower Q in Felixstowe town in 1941;
* Naval Port War Signal Station; controlling ship movements in and out of Harwich Harbour, Stour and Orwell;
* Remote control station for defensive minefields in the harbour entrance.

Observers on top of Landguard Fort witnessed and plotted many air raids, German minelaying actions, shipwrecks and air crashes. In 1944, in a probable false alarm, the Landguard guns opened up on supposed German midget-sub raiders in the harbour entrance. Later that year, Allied landing ships loaded at the former RAF piers just to the north.

The 10-inch gun pit in Left Battery was converted into an Anti-aircraft Operations Room for Harwich in 1939.

The Army left the Fort in 1957.

The fort has been structurally consolidated. It is now under the guardianship of English Heritage and is open to the public.

<text>Viviane Adélaïde Reding (born 27 April 1951) is a Luxembourgish politician and a former Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Luxembourg. She is a member of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party, part of the European People&#x27;s Party. She previously served as European Commissioner for Education and Culture from 1999 to 2004, European Commissioner for Information Society and Media from 2004 to 2010 and European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship from 2010 to 2014.

Before starting a professional career as a journalist for the leading newspaper in Luxembourg, the &quot;Luxemburger Wort&quot;, she obtained a doctorate in human sciences at the Sorbonne. From 1986 to 1998, she was President of the Luxembourg Union of Journalists. On 27 November 2009, she was elevated in the &quot;Barroso II Commission&quot; to vice-president responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship. She is also an advisor for the transatlantic think-tank European Horizons.

==Political career==
===Role in Luxembourg politics===
Reding started her political career in 1979 as a Member of the Luxembourg Parliament and held the following positions:
* President of social committee
* Member of the Office of the Chamber of Deputies
* Member of the Benelux Parliament
* Member of the North Atlantic Assembly (leader of Christian Democrat/Conservative group)

From 1981 to 1999, she was Communal conciliator of the city of Esch, in which she was President of the Cultural Affairs Committee from 1992 to 1999.

From 1988 to 1993, she was national president of the Christian-Social Women and from 1995 to 1999 and president of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–1999===
Reding served as the leader of Luxembourg&#x27;s EPP delegation in the European Parliament from 1989 to 1999 and she was a Member of the group&#x27;s Bureau.

Within the European Parliament, she held positions as chairwoman of the Committee on Petitions for 3 years, and vice-chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for 2 years each.

===European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth, Media and Sport, 1999–2004===
From 1999 to 2004, Reding was appointed Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth, Media and Sport.

In her first term as European Commissioner Viviane Reding pushed through the Erasmus Mundus expanding the co-operation between universities and university students of the European Union and the rest of the world. Among other achievements she has also played a key role in strengthening the Culture 2000 programme and the EU MEDIA programme.

===European Commissioner for Information Society and Media, 2004–2010===
In 2004 Reding became Commissioner for Information Society and Media.

While serving in the European Commission under President Barroso, Reding found a relatively popular policy in lowering roaming charges of mobile phones when travelling within the European Union, stating: &quot;For years, mobile roaming charges have remained unjustifiably high. We are therefore tackling one the last borders within Europe&#x27;s internal market&quot;. Her legislation to cap roaming charges was approved by the Parliament in April 2007.

On 7 April 2006 the commission launched the new &quot;.eu&quot; TLD for websites for EU companies and citizens wishing to have a non-national European internet address. This has proven popular with 2.5 million being registered by April 2007. It is now the seventh most popular TLD worldwide, and third in Europe (after .de and .uk).

In an unsuccessful bid to centralize regulatory oversight, Reding proposed in 2007 that the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) be folded into a new European Electronic Communications Market Authority (EECMA).

Reding also promoted the use of the 112, the Single European Emergency Number following the European Union Directive 2002/22/EC.

Reding also proposed that major European telecom companies be forced to separate their network and service operations to promote competition in the market. The companies, including France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, would still own their networks but the separate management structure would be obliged to treat other operators on an equal basis in offering access to the network. This is opposed to separate ideas to force a full break-up of such companies.

In 2008 the European Parliament voted to pass the &quot;Telecoms Package&quot;, which would render the entire market a region into one market, making it easier to sell internet and phone services in EU, with the goal of making the telecom prices cheaper for customers in European Union. Among the many amendments to the proposal, amendment 138 was voted in favour with 574 votes for, and 73 against. This particular amendment requires any termination of internet subscription to be heard in front of a judge. Reding is known as an advocate for an open Internet, resisting attempts in 2010 by her colleague, Swedish EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, to block access to websites. In 2012 she disputed with EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht 2012 over the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). She favoured that amendment leading to the defeat of three-strikes policies such as those promoted by France&#x27;s Hadopi law.

===Vice-President of the European Commission, 2010–2014===
In June 2009, Reding was elected Member of the European Parliament, heading the list of the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party.

On 9 February 2010, Reding was confirmed in her third term as European Commissioner becoming vice-president and commissioner responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship. She was also given responsibility for the commission&#x27;s Directorate-General for Communication. In May 2010, Reding succeeded in having the original Directorate for Justice, Freedom and Security split in two, with the resulting Directorate-General for Justice – responsible for civil and criminal justice, fundamental rights, and citizenship – subsequently being added to her portfolio.

Upon taking office she put in place a truly EU Justice policy launching a series of groundbreaking proposals in the field of civil, commercial and criminal justice in line with the ambitions set by the Treaty of Lisbon to establish a European area of justice. This included proposals to strengthen the rights of people in criminal proceedings, both as accused and as victims. Many of these proposals are becoming European law and consequently improving the rights of citizens across the European Union. She has also initiated a series of proposals aimed at making justice contribute for growth enabling both businesses and consumers to benefit fully from their rights in the European single market. These included proposals in field of consumer rights, in the field of cross order recovery of debts, sales law and data protection. Viviane Reding has also put in practice a fundamental rights culture across the European institutions and their policies. In October 2010 she set out a strategy and a methodology to achieve that end in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. She has also put in motion a citizenship-centred agenda with the drafting of the first-ever EU Citizenship report in October 2010 proposing concrete measures to make European Union citizens&#x27; lives easier.

In addition, Reding also pushed for strengthening the EU&#x27;s commitment to equality between women and men and consequently adopted a Women&#x27;s Charter. Moreover, Viviane Reding has also presented measures to improve the representation of women in boardrooms of publicly listed companies. In September 2012 it became known that Reding was working on a proposal for introducing the 40% rule opening the way for women to be more represented in supervisory boards or non-executive board members of public listed companies in Europe. This proposal has generated a vocal debate across Europe with disparate groups of stakeholders in favour and against. In response to the specific opposition by a group of only male Ambassadors or Permanent Representative of European Union Member States Reding stated that &quot;thankfully, European laws on important topics like this are not made by nine men in dark suits behind closed doors, but rather in a democratic process&quot;. After a long discussion in the European Commission Mrs Reding&#x27;s ideas, shared, among others, by the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durão Barroso and the Commissioners with economic portfolios (Joaquín Almunia, Antonio Tajani, Olli Rehn, Michel Barnier and Laszlo Andor) prevailed over the views of fellow Commissioners such as Neelie Kroes, Catherine Ashton, Cecilia Malmström and Janusz Lewandowski and a proposal for a Directive was adopted on 14 November 2012. All major political parties in the European Parliament welcomed the proposal.

She also pushed measures to improve the rights of people with disabilities across Europe by eradicating discrimination on the grounds of disability and eliminating the barriers faced by Europeans with disabilities whenever accessing goods and services.

On 7 July 2010, Reding had an official meeting with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Thorbjørn Jagland, to launch joint talks on the EU&#x27;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. On that occasion, she was assaulted by a man with mental health problems in front of the Palace of Europe.

On 11 July 2011, Reding expressed criticism of the power exercised by the three major US credit rating agencies stating that breaking up the big three was an option being considered. This criticism was followed on 25 July 2012 with a statement questioning the timing and motivations behind the US rating agency Moody&#x27;s comments over European ratings, drawing links with rating announcements in Europe with attempts to divert the attention of the markets from the growing debt mountain and economic difficulties in the US.

In April 2012 Reding declined an invitation by UEFA President Michel Platini to attend the UEFA Euro 2012 championships citing &quot;institutional reasons&quot;. She used the opportunity to invite UEFA &quot;to take account of the dramatic situation of Yulia Tymoshenko&quot; stressing that Europeans &quot;cannot close their eyes on human rights even during a great sporting celebration&quot;. During the championships and in particular during the Germany vs. Netherlands match in Kharkiv she used her Twitter account to remind viewers about the plight of Ms Tymoshenko.

In December 2012, in an interview to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; Reding dubbed as &quot;crazy&quot; the plans of United Kingdom Prime Minister David Cameron to opt out from EU co-operation mechanisms such as Europol, Eurojust and the European Arrest Warrant. In her opinion she stated &#x27;Such move would leave the UK without access to important EU police and criminal justice databases which would risk transforming the UK into a safe haven for major criminals including paedophiles and drug traffickers&#x27;.

Her action in support of citizenship rights and the rule of law has put her on collision course with governments, of both sides of the political aisle, who attempt to use their government prerogatives to limit the independent role of courts, media or the conduct of elections. This stance in favour of democracy and the rule of law has brought her strong attacks by the right wing Fidesz controlled government of Viktor Orbán in Hungary.

In June 2013 at a citizens dialogue in Esch-sur-Alzette Reding commented on the revelations of mass-scale spying by the US National Security Agency on Europeans stating that &quot;partners do not spy on each other&quot;, stressing that such behaviour by the US Administration risks undermining trade talks with the European Union.

In July 2013 Reding sympathised with the protesters in Sofia, Bulgaria, who called in the streets for an oligarch-free government. She has also called for political unity and consensus in Bulgaria.

Also in July 2013 Reding called on the government of Croatia to change its law. The Constitution of Croatia claimed that &quot;A citizen of the Republic of Croatia cannot be exiled from the Republic of Croatia nor have his citizenship revoked, nor can he be extradited to another country.&quot;, which was changed in 2010., now saying &quot;A citizen of the Republic of Croatia cannot be exiled from the Republic of Croatia nor have his citizenship revoked, nor can he be extradited to another country, unless a decision of extradition has to be made in accordance to the international contract(s) or EU acquis.&quot; &quot;Zakon o pravosudnoj suradnji u kaznenim stvarima s državama članicama Europske unije&quot; (ZoPSEU) (eng. The law of Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters with the Member States of the European Union) came into effect on 1 July 2013., the date Croatia became an EU member. As Croatia became a full-fledged EU member, European Arrest Warrants were sent to the addresses of Croatian judiciary institutions, a total of 84 warrants by 2 July 2013. at 10 AM. Although the warrants included the warrant for Josip Perković, the police did not detain him, as the felony he is charged with took place before 2002., and by the same criteria, 19 other warrants will not be considered. Viviane Reding urged the Croatian government to change this, as the media dubbed the problematic law &quot;Lex Perković&quot;, and Mrs Reding threatened with diplomatic sanctions against Croatia. However, as Croatia wishes to be on par with other EU members, and in France the European Arrest Warrant is applied to felonies committed after 1 November 1993., and in Austria, Italy and Luxembourg after 7 August 2002., there seems to be no reason Croatia should abolish its 2002. rule, since a legal precedent in other EU member states exists.

In January 2014, Reding publicly announced that she has no plans to seek the nomination of the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party for the presidency of the European Commission and that she supports the candidacy of fellow centre-right Luxembourger Jean-Claude Juncker. Johannes Hahn twice served as Acting Commissioner in her stead, from 19 April 2014 – 25 May 2014 while she was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament, and 1 July 2014 – 16 July 2014 after she took up her seat.

===&quot;Future of Europe&quot; initiative, 2012===
In February 2012 Reding challenged her fellow European leaders to start working towards designing the future of the united European continent. In an article first published in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; she called for a political union in Europe as a necessary step to transform the current European Union into a genuine economic, monetary and political union.

The Reding initiative led a group of foreign affairs ministers of the European Union to put together a reflection group animated by the German foreign minister Guido Westerwelle on the future of Europe. The plan also served as inspiration and guidance to the report prepared in June 2012 by Herman Van Rompuy, José Manuel Barroso, Jean Claude Juncker and Mario Draghi to the European Council on the need to develop the united European continent into a genuine Economic and Monetary Union.

In May 2012 Reding delivered a speech on the Future of Europe in Tallinn, Estonia at the XXV Congress of the Fédération Internationale du Droit Européen. On 12 September 2012 José Manuel Barroso delivered the State of the Union speech in Strasbourg, taking up and elaborating on many of the ideas set out by Reding since early 2012.

In November 2012 Reding further detailed her ideas in a speech in Passau, Germany and later in a series of articles and interviews calling for the establishment of the United States of Europe building upon the Blueprint for a Deep and Genuine Economic and Monetary Union presented by the European Commission on 30 November 2012.

As part of the European debate on the Future of Europe Reding initiated in late 2012 a series of Citizens Dialogues bringing European politicians into town-hall meetings with European citizens. These dialogues began in Cadiz in Spain in September 2012 and took place across Europe throughout 2013, the European Year of Citizens.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2014–2018===
Following the 2014 European elections, Reding put herself forward as a candidate to be a Vice-president of the European Parliament. However she came in last in an internal vote to select the European People&#x27;s Party Group candidates. She subsequently failed in her bid to become the EPP&#x27;s candidate to chair the Committee on Legal Affairs.

Reding currently serves as a member of the Committee on International Trade. In addition to her committee assignments, Reding is a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on Long Term Investment and Reindustrialisation and the European Parliament Intergroup on the Digital Agenda.

==Controversies==

===Controversy over Roma===

After the leak of a French Interior Ministry circular of 5 August 2010, Reding made a public statement that was interpreted as likening the 2010 French deportations of the Roma to those made from France by the occupying German forces during World War II: &quot;I personally have been appalled by a situation which gave the impression that people are being removed from a Member State of the European Union just because they belong to a certain ethnic minority. This is a situation I had thought Europe would not have to witness again after the Second World War&quot;.

For a while, the French government&#x27;s claim that it was expelling people on legal rather than ethnic grounds was claimed to be &quot;openly contradicted by an administrative circular issue by the same government&quot; mentioning the illegal Romani camps specifically (&quot;en priorité ceux des Roms&quot;). This mention could be explained by the fact that Romani account for the overwhelming majority of foreign migrants setting up camps in France, and that &quot;most Roma from the two countries [Bulgaria and Romania] are thought to be in France illegally&quot;. The then French President Nicolas Sarkozy stated that his government had been unaware of the directive in question signed by Mr Michel Bart, the Chief of Staff of the French Minister of the Interior, and that the directive had been cancelled as soon as the government became aware of it through press reports. He stated that France continues to welcome refugees and that &quot;we refuse the creation of slums... that are unworthy of French Republic or European ideals.&quot; President Sarkozy also stated that 80% of people removed from the camps during August 2010 were of French &quot;gens du voyage&quot;, i.e. most of the campers thus removed were not foreign citizens or Roma; and that all removals were done based on judicial decisions, i.e. they were not unilateral police operations as would be based on a circular directive.

The French government further stated that Reding had made an &quot;unseemly blunder&quot; and defended France as &quot;the mother of human rights.&quot; Mr Sarkozy denounced Reding&#x27;s comments as &quot;scandalous&quot; and stated that &quot;if Luxembourg wants to take in Roma, that is no problem&quot; as far as France is concerned. This statement was based on Luxembourg&#x27;s own rejection of migrants, yet Luxembourg&#x27;s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jean Asselborn, deemed it &quot;malevolent&quot;. President Sarkozy pointed out that Mrs Reding had been silent during larger-scale expulsions by other countries in earlier years, including by Italy specifically of its Roma during 2009 and when police reject Romani travellers trying to enter Luxembourg. French Immigration Minister Eric Besson said that in her statement Reding &quot;intentionally skids, if I may say, that is she uses an expression aimed to shock, that contains an anachronistic fallacy, and that creates a false amalgam&quot;.

While some media coverage and opinion leaders supported her actions, others called for her immediate resignation.

Following her initial statement, and intense discussions in the European Council and in the European Parliament, Mrs Reding announced that the European Commission intended to sue France at the European Court of Justice within two weeks. At the instigation of Mrs Reding, the European Commission later set up a Roma task force to analyse to what extent measures were being effectively taken to help the social and economic integration of Roma in Europe. Mrs Reding subsequently privately recanted the historical comparison in her initial statement. Her office apologised for the analogy. The European Commission subsequently declined to follow up on the earlier threat to sue France at the European Court of Justice, or to take other legal action on the Roma matter against France.

Subsequently, the EU said it would seek to compel European Union countries to amend their national rules to the requirements of the European Union&#x27;s free movement laws, but in so doing did not deny the lawfulness of the French actions.
Zoni Weisz, a Roma activist and Holocaust deportation escapee who addressed the German Bundestag&#x27;s Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony on 27 January 2011, praised Mrs Reding&#x27;s &#x27;clear words&#x27; in denouncing Roma expulsions. Hungarian MEP Lívia Járóka, the sole European Parliament member to have partly Roma heritage, described the root problem as &quot;the failure of Roma integration in most member states in the last 20 years&quot;.

As a result of the action taken by Reding in the defence of the rights of citizens, national governments of the Member States of the European Union were obliged to put in place national strategies and concrete plans for the integration of Romani people and to report on their implementation annually.

In August 2012, Reding put the action of the French socialist government of Jean-Marc Ayrault and his Minister of the Interior Manuel Valls under surveillance responding to alleged expulsions of Roma people. The call resulted in a shift of policy by the French government confirmed in a Ministerial executive order signed by nine French Ministers and placing the focus of the action on the integration of the Roma as called for by the European Commission.

<text>Messier 103 (also known as M103, or NGC 581) is a small open cluster of many faint stars in Cassiopeia. It was discovered on 27 March 1781 by Pierre Méchain, but later added as Charles Messier&#x27;s last deep-sky object in his catalogue. 

It is located 9,400 light-years from the Sun and is about 15 light years across. It holds two prominent stars, of which the brightest is magnitude 10.5, and in the center of the cluster, another magnitude 10.8 red giant. Another bright foreground object is the double star Struve 131, but is not a member of the cluster. Cluster membership is about 172 stars based on &gt;50% probability of gravitational attachment that binds the cluster together. M103 is between 12.6 to 25 million years in age.

==Observation history==
After the discovery of Messier 101 through 103 by Pierre Méchain, Messier later added this open cluster to his own catalogue. In 1783, William Herschel described the region of M103 as 14 to 16 &quot;pL&quot; (pretty large stars) and with great many &quot;eS&quot; or extremely faint ones. Åke Wallenquist first identified 40 stars in M103 while Antonín Bečvář raised this to 60. Archinal and Hynes suggest that the cluster has 172 stars. Admiral William Henry Smyth pointed out the cluster&#x27;s 10.8-magnitude red giant, citing it was a double star on Cassiopeia&#x27;s knee, about 1° northeast of Delta Cassiopeiae, sometimes called as Ruchbah or Rukhbah.

==Telescopic view==
Messier 103 is an easy object to find and the cluster is visible in binoculars or a small telescope. object to find and the cluster is visible even with the use of binoculars. M103 can be seen as a nebulous fan-shaped patch, and is about a fifth the apparent diameter of the Moon or 6 arcminute (6′) or 0.1° across. To find M103, it is suggested that the observer center on Ruchbah or the lowest star of the signature “W” asterism of Cassiopeia. The cluster will appear as a hazy patch in a field about the length of an imaginary line towards Epsilon Cassiopeiae, a northern endpoint of the &#x27;W&#x27;, and placed on the outer side of the &#x27;W&#x27;.

<text>The SPAD S.XIII is a French biplane fighter aircraft of the First World War, developed by &quot;Société Pour L&#x27;Aviation et ses Dérivés&quot; (SPAD) from the earlier and highly successful SPAD S.VII.

During early 1917, the French designer Louis Béchereau, spurred by the approaching obsolescence of the S.VII, decided to develop two new fighter aircraft, the S.XII and the S.XIII, both using a powerful new geared version of the successful Hispano-Suiza 8A engine. The cannon armament of the S.XII was unpopular, but the S.XIII proved to be one of the most capable fighters of the war, as well as one of the most-produced, with 8,472 built and orders for around 10,000 more cancelled at the Armistice.

By the end of the First World War, the S.XIII had equipped virtually every fighter squadron of the &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;. In addition, the United States Army Air Service also procured the type in bulk during the conflict, and some replaced or supplemented S.VIIs in the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), pending the arrival of Sopwith Dolphins. It proved popular with its pilots and numerous aces from various nations flew the S.XIII. Following the Armistice of 11 November 1918, which marked the end of the First World War, surplus S.XIIIs were sold to both civil and military operators throughout the world.

==Development==
===Background===
The origins of the SPAD S.XIII lies in the performance of its predecessor, the SPAD S.VII, a single-seat fighter aircraft powered by a direct drive Hispano-Suiza 8A water-cooled V-8 engine and armed with a single synchronised Vickers machine gun. The type had good performance for the time, and entered service with the French &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot; during August 1916. By early 1917, however, the S.VII had been surpassed by the latest German fighters such as the Albatros D.III.

More capable German fighters soon resulted in a shift in aerial supremacy towards the Central Powers, which led to calls for better aircraft. French flying ace Georges Guynemer personally lobbied for an improved S.VII, telling the SPAD&#x27;s designer Louis Béchereau that &quot;The 150 hp SPAD is not a match for the Halberstadt ... More speed is needed.&quot; A quick solution to the problem was to increase the compression ratio of the Hispano-Suiza engine, which increased its power to to significantly improve performance, allowing the SPAD S.VII to remain competitive for the time being.

Hispano-Suiza were already in the process of developing a more powerful geared version of the 8A engine, and this engine was chosen by Béchereau to power two developed versions of the S.VII. The British Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a and Sopwith Dolphin fighters would also be powered by the same engine.

===Intro flight===
The first of Béchereau&#x27;s designs to fly with the new, reduction gear HS.8B engine design series was the S.XII in its HS.8BeC (or &quot;HS-38&quot;) version, which was armed with an unusual cannon that fired through the propeller shaft. However, this aircraft only saw limited use, having been rapidly followed into production by the more conventionally armed S.XIII, which was deemed to be a preferable configuration by several French pilots and officials. Aviation author C.F. Andrews has claimed that a large portion of the credit for the S.XIII lies with Marc Birkigt, the designer of the engine, who had chosen to introduce various innovative features upon it, such as monobloc aluminium cylinders, which were furnished with screwed-in steel liners, which improved its performance.

The SPAD S.XIII flew for the first time on 4 April 1917. An early distinguishing feature of the S.XIII – as with the SPAD S.XII – was that its similarly geared HS.8Be V8 engine had a left-handed propeller, which rotating in the opposite rotation to the earlier, direct-drive HS.8A-powered S.VII. Early on, similarly to the British Sopwith Dolphin also powered with HS.8B-series geared V8s, problems were encountered with the gearing, however, Béchereau persisted with the engine, which soon became fairly reliable. Production was ramped up almost immediately after the first flight. Within months of its first flight, the S.XIII had not only entered service with the &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot;, but had proven itself to be a successful fighter.

==Design==
The SPAD S.XIII was a single-engine biplane fighter aircraft. In terms of its construction, it shared a similar configuration and layout to the earlier S.VII, featuring a mainly wooden structure with a fabric covering. It was however generally larger and heavier than its predecessor. Other changes were made to the ailerons, the rounded tips of the tailplanes, the bulkier cowling accommodating the gear-drive Hispano-Suiza 8B engine, and enlarged fin and rudder with a curved trailing edge. The S.XIII was armed with a pair of forward-mounted Vickers machine guns with 400 rounds per gun, which replaced the single gun of the earlier aircraft.

The S.XIII featured relatively conventional construction, that being a wire-braced biplane with a box-shaped fuselage and a nose-mounted engine, except for its interposed wing struts located halfway along the wing span, which gave the fighter the appearance of being a double-bay aircraft instead of a single-bay. This change prevented the landing brace wires from whipping and chafing during flight. Otherwise, it had an orthodox structure, comprising wooden members attached to metal joint fixtures. The fuselage consisted of four square-section longerons, with wooden struts and cross-members while braced with heavy-gauge piano wire. Wire cable was used for the flying and landing wires.

To enable a two-hour endurance, the S.XIII was fitted with several underbelly fuel tanks held within the forward fuselage area which fed into the main service tank in the upper wing center section with an engine-driven pump. Similar pumps were used for supplying pressurised oil and water circulation between the engine&#x27;s radiator and a header tank was housed within the upper wing. The circular nose radiator incorporated vertical Venetian-style blinds to regulate engine temperatures.

The upper wing was made in one piece, with hollow box-section short spars that connected with linen-wrapped scarf joints, Andrews claims that long runs of spruce were difficult to obtain. Plywood webs and spruce capping strips, internally braced with piano wire, formed the airfoil. The upper wing was fitted with ailerons, actuated by the pilot via a series of tubular pushrods that ran vertical directly beneath the ailerons, with external, 90° bellcranks mounted on top of the lower wings. The lower wing had spruce leading edges and wire-cable trailing edges, while the surfaces were fabric-covered and treated with aircraft dope to produce a scalloped effect.

While the forward Vickers machine guns were standard, they were not always available. As a result of a shortage during the last months of the war, several American S.XIII squadrons replaced Vickers .303 machine guns with the lighter .30/06-calibre Marlin Rockwell M1917 and M1918 aircraft machine guns, saving some over the Vickers&#x27; , for the guns alone. By the end of the war, about half of American S.XIIIs had been converted.

The powerplant of the S.XIII was a geared Hispano-Suiza engine, at first a 8Ba providing , but in later aircraft a high-compression 8Bc or 8Be delivering was often used. These improvements produced a notable improvement in flight and combat performance. It was faster than its main contemporaries, the British Sopwith Camel and the German Fokker D.VII, and its higher power-to-weight ratio gave it a good rate of climb. The SPAD was renowned for its speed and strength in a dive, although the maneuverability of the type was relatively poor and the aircraft was difficult to control at low speeds, needing to be landed with power on, unlike contemporary fighters like the Nieuport 27 which could be landed with power off.

The geared engines proved to be unreliable, suffering from vibration and poor lubrication. This severely affected serviceability, with it being claimed in November 1917 that the Spad S.XIII was &quot;incapable of giving dependable service&quot;. Even in April 1918, an official report stated that two-thirds of the SPADs were out of use at any one time due to engine problems. At least one American observer believed at the time that the French were giving the American SPAD XIII squadrons lower-quality engines from their least favored manufacturers while keeping the best for themselves. The reliability issues were an acceptable price to pay for improved performance, however, improved build quality and changes to the engine improved serviceability.

At the beginning of 1918 the Aviation Militaire issued a requirement for a more powerful fighter, in a C1 (&quot;Chasseur&quot; single-seat) specification. SPAD responded by fitting the Hispano-Suiza 8Fb in the SPAD XIII airframe. The structure was strengthened and improved aerodynamically, retaining the dimensions of the SPAD XIII. Twenty SPAD XVII fighters were built and issued to units with GC 12 (&quot;Les Cigones&quot;).

==Operational history==
Deliveries to the commenced During May 1917, only one month following the type&#x27;s first flight. The new aircraft quickly became an important element in the French plans for its fighter force, being expected to replace the SPAD S.VII as well as remaining Nieuport fighters in front line service.

However the slow rate of deliveries disrupted these forecasts and by the end of March 1918, only 764 of the planned 2,230 had been delivered.

Eventually, the S.XIII equipped nearly every French fighter squadron, 74 escadrilles, during the First World War. At the end of the war, plans were underway to replace the S.XIII with several fighter types powered by the Hispano-Suiza 8F, such as the Nieuport-Delage NiD 29, the SPAD S.XX and the Sopwith Dolphin II. These plans lapsed following the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918, which ended the First World War and the SPAD S.XIII remained in French service as a fighter aircraft until 1923, with Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 deliveries being delayed until 1920.

The S.XIII was flown by numerous famous French fighter pilots such as Rene Fonck (the highest scoring Allied ace, with 75 victories), Georges Guynemer (54 victories), and Charles Nungesser (45 victories), and also by the leading Italian ace Francesco Baracca (34 victories). Aces of the United States Army Air Service who flew the S.XIII include Eddie Rickenbacker (the United States&#x27; leading First World War ace with 26 victories) and Frank Luke (18 victories). Andrews attributes the S.XIII&#x27;s natural stability, which made it a steady gun platform, as the key for its success.

===USAAS===
Other Allied forces were quick to adopt the new fighter as well and the SPAD XIII equipped 15 of the 16 operational USAAS pursuit squadrons by the Armistice. Prior to the United States entry into the war, American volunteers flying with the Allies had been flying the type. Nearly half of the 893 purchased by the United States were still in service by 1920. In the United States, some S.XIIIs were re-engined with Wright-Hispano engines and used to prepare pilots for the new Thomas-Morse MB-3 fighter (which used SPAD-type wings) in 1922. The Wright-Hispano engines were unable to matching the performance of the original powerplant.

===RFC===
During December 1917, No.23 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) equipped with the SPAD S.XIII and retaining them until April 1918 when it re-equipped with the Dolphin, while No. 19 Squadron (equipped with the earlier S.VII) also operated at least one S.XIII for a time. The type was used as an interim fighter while awaiting delivery of British-built aircraft.

In his memoir Sagittarius Rising, Cecil Lewis described an aerial competition between himself and a SPAD flown by Guynemer, and Lewis in an SE5, &quot;Their speeds were almost identical, but the high-compression Spad climbed quicker. After the race was over, Guynemeyer and I held a demonstration combat over the aerodrome. Again I was badly worsted. Guynemeyer was all over me. In his hands the Spad was a marvel of flexibility. In the first minute I should have been shot down a dozen times&quot;.

===Corpo Aeronautico Militare===
The S.XIII was also acquired by Italy for the Corpo Aeronautico Militare. Italian pilots expressed a preference for another French-built fighter, the Hanriot HD.1, which was more maneuverable but less powerful. Belgium also operated the S.XIII and one Belgian ace, Edmond Thieffry, came to prominence while piloting the type. After the end of the war, the S.XIII was also exported, including to Japan, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
