<text>In computer graphics, slerp is shorthand for spherical linear interpolation, introduced by Ken Shoemake in the context of quaternion interpolation for the purpose of animating 3D rotation. It refers to constant-speed motion along a unit-radius great circle arc, given the ends and an interpolation parameter between 0 and 1.

== Geometric slerp ==
Slerp has a geometric formula independent of quaternions, and independent of the dimension of the space in which the arc is embedded. This formula, a symmetric weighted sum credited to Glenn Davis, is based on the fact that any point on the curve must be a linear combination of the ends. Let &quot;p&quot;0 and &quot;p&quot;1 be the first and last points of the arc, and let &quot;t&quot; be the parameter, . Compute Ω as the angle subtended by the arc, so that , the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional dot product of the unit vectors from the origin to the ends. The geometric formula is then
: formula_1

The symmetry lies in the fact that . In the limit as , this formula reduces to the corresponding symmetric formula for linear interpolation,
: formula_2

A slerp path is, in fact, the spherical geometry equivalent of a path along a line segment in the plane; a great circle is a spherical geodesic.
More familiar than the general slerp formula is the case when the end vectors are perpendicular, in which case the formula is . Letting , and applying the trigonometric identity , this becomes the slerp formula. The factor of in the general formula is a normalization, since a vector &quot;p&quot;1 at an angle of Ω to &quot;p&quot;0 projects onto the perpendicular ⊥&quot;p&quot;0 with a length of only .

Some special cases of slerp admit more efficient calculation. When a circular arc is to be drawn into a raster image, the preferred method is some variation of Bresenham&#x27;s circle algorithm. Evaluation at the special parameter values 0 and 1 trivially yields &quot;p&quot;0 and &quot;p&quot;1, respectively; and bisection, evaluation at , simplifies to , normalized. Another special case, common in animation, is evaluation with fixed ends and equal parametric steps. If &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 and &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; are two consecutive values, and if &quot;c&quot; is twice their dot product (constant for all steps), then the next value, &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;+1, is the reflection .

== Quaternion slerp ==
When slerp is applied to unit quaternions, the quaternion path maps to a path through 3D rotations in a standard way. The effect is a rotation with uniform angular velocity around a fixed rotation axis. When the initial end point is the identity quaternion, slerp gives a segment of a one-parameter subgroup of both the Lie group of 3D rotations, SO(3), and its universal covering group of unit quaternions, &quot;S&quot;3. Slerp gives a straightest and shortest path between its quaternion end points, and maps to a rotation through an angle of 2Ω. However, because the covering is double (&quot;q&quot; and −&quot;q&quot; map to the same rotation), the rotation path may turn either the &quot;short way&quot; (less than 180°) or the &quot;long way&quot; (more than 180°). Long paths can be prevented by negating one end if the dot product, , is negative, thus ensuring that .

Slerp also has expressions in terms of quaternion algebra, all using exponentiation. Real powers of a quaternion are defined in terms of the quaternion exponential function, written as &quot;e&quot;&quot;q&quot; and given by the power series equally familiar from calculus, complex analysis and matrix algebra:
: formula_3

Writing a unit quaternion &quot;q&quot; in versor form, , with v a unit 3-vector, and noting that the quaternion square v2 equals −1 (implying a quaternion version of Euler&#x27;s formula), we have , and . The identification of interest is , so that the real part of &quot;q&quot; is , the same as the geometric dot product used above. Here are four equivalent quaternion expressions for slerp.

: formula_4

The derivative of with respect to &quot;t&quot;, assuming the ends are fixed, is log(&quot;q&quot;1&quot;q&quot;0−1) times the function value, where the quaternion natural logarithm in this case yields half the 3D angular velocity vector. The initial tangent vector is parallel transported to each tangent along the curve; thus the curve is, indeed, a geodesic.

In the tangent space at any point on a quaternion slerp curve, the inverse of the exponential map transforms the curve into a line segment. Slerp curves not extending through a point fail to transform into lines in that point&#x27;s tangent space.

Quaternion slerps are commonly used to construct smooth animation curves by mimicking affine constructions like the de Casteljau algorithm for Bézier curves. Since the sphere is not an affine space, familiar properties of affine constructions may fail, though the constructed curves may otherwise be entirely satisfactory. For example, the de Casteljau algorithm may be used to split a curve in affine space; this does not work on a sphere.

The two-valued slerp can be extended to interpolate among many unit quaternions, but the extension loses the fixed execution-time of the slerp algorithm.

<doc id="960936" wikidata="Q1620072" url="?curid=960936" title="Hippopotamus Defence">
<text>The Hippopotamus Defence is a chess employed by Black, consisting of a double structure (bishops on b7 and g7) and a small (pawns on d6 and e6). The knights are typically developed to e7 and d7 and the rook&#x27;s pawns to a6 and h6. This structure can be obtained by a wide variety of move orders but it occurs most frequently via the Modern Defence (1.e4 g6) or Owen&#x27;s Defence (1.e4 b6). The Hippopotamus can also be played against queen&#x27;s pawn openings or flank openings and is thus a genuinely universal system. The same structure is also occasionally utilized by White.
==History==
The first master strength player to experiment with Hippopotamus-type structures appears to have been the Slovak International Master Maximilian Ujtelky. The opening first came to public prominence, however, after being adopted twice by Boris Spassky in his 1966 World Championship match against Tigran Petrosian (after which the setup was dubbed the &quot;Hippopotamus&quot; by commentators). Spassky would appear to have been influenced by his 1964 game vs. Ujtelky, where he faced the same setup that he would later employ against Petrosian.

Prominent players to have adopted the Hippopotamus on an occasional basis in more recent years include Vlastimil Hort, Igor Glek, Mihai Suba, Tony Miles, Gata Kamsky, Pavel Blatny and Luke McShane. Meanwhile, Kiril Georgiev and Hikaru Nakamura have used the system as an anti-computer line. Other players to have adopted the Hippopotamus include Aron Nimzowitsch, Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen.

==Analysis==

While Black sets up the Hippopotamus structure White is able to develop freely. If White proceeds in accordance with principles a position will arise similar to that shown in the diagram. Black has adopted the complete Hippopotamus setup with pawns on a6, b6, d6, e6, g6 and h6, fianchettoed bishops on b7 and g7, and knights on d7 and e7. White, meanwhile, has occupied the centre with pawns, developed the minor pieces to central positions, castled and centralised rooks. Despite having achieved an ideal classical development White now faces a dilemma in terms of how to proceed, as Black has pawn control of every square on the fifth rank (a5–h5). White can thus only make headway by advancing a pawn into Black’s side of the board.

===Pawn structure types===
If White should advance e4–e5, Black will typically lock the central pawns with ...d6–d5. This gives rise to a central similar to that seen in many lines of the French Defence. Black will then proceed with the typical French ...c7–c5 and thematic queenside play. 

Returning to the diagram position, if White should instead advance d4–d5, Black will again respond by locking the central pawns, this time with ...e6–e5. The structure then resembles that seen in many lines of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence. Black will likely proceed with either (a) the thematic King’s Indian pawn break ...f7–f5 (usually following ...0-0), or (b) the typical Hippo idea of ...g6–g5 and ...Ne7–g6–f4, either of which plans may result in a kingside attack. Note that in positions where White intends to play d4–d5 the White queen would usually be deployed to d2 rather than e2 (thus avoiding the possibility of Black doubling White&#x27;s pawns by responding to d4–d5 with ...Bg7xNc3). 

If White opts against playing either e4–e5 or d4–d5, Black may begin to advance against the castled White king with moves such as ...g6–g5, ...Ng6, etc. (or, if White had castled queenside, ...b6–b5, ...Nb6, etc.). Alternatively Black might play the pawn break ...c7–c5, after which the structure may transform to resemble a Sicilian (following a later ...c5xd4 or d4xc5) or a Benoni (following a later d4–d5). 

To allow the various options given above, Black’s main objective in the early stages will be to remain flexible, including by delaying any decision about until after the central pawn structure has been defined. 

The Hippopotamus can be considered an anti-theory opening, with Black’s play tending to rely on a thematic understanding of the major chess openings mentioned above rather than on specific opening variations or move orders. 

The positions arising from the Hippopotamus differ from standard positions in the French Defence, King&#x27;s Indian Defence, etc., as various pawns and pieces will be displaced compared to their usual positions in those openings. For example, in the King&#x27;s Indian, Black would not have fianchettoed the queen&#x27;s bishop, and White would prefer to have the c-pawn on c4 rather than c2. Hippopotamus middlegames are often defined by how the players navigate these differences and attempt to turn them to their own advantage or their opponent&#x27;s disadvantage. 

While White can be expected to obtain a space advantage in most variations of the Hippopotamus Defence, Black will often have a practical advantage due to greater familiarity with the various transpositional possibilities in this rare opening complex. White must also be wary of playing in too aggressive a fashion or of overextending, after which the dynamism of Black&#x27;s seemingly passive structure may quickly become apparent (see, for example, Barczay vs. Ivkov, below).

<text>Oscar Gomer Swahn (20 October 1847 – 1 May 1927) was a Swedish shooter who competed at three Olympic games and won six medals, including three gold. Swahn holds records as the oldest Olympian at the time of competition, the oldest person to win gold, and the oldest athlete to win an Olympic medal.

==Biography==
At the 1908 Summer Olympics, Oscar Swahn won two gold medals in the running deer, single shot events (individual and team), and a bronze medal in the running deer double shot individual event. He was 60 years old, a year younger than Joshua Millner, the oldest gold medallist at that time.

When the 1912 Summer Olympics came to his native country, Sweden, he was a member of the single shot running deer team which again won the gold medal. He also won bronze again at the individual double shot running deer event, but came joint fourth in the individual single shot event, which was won by his son Alfred Swahn. At 64 years and 258 days of age, he became the oldest gold medalist ever, a record he still holds.

At the 1920 Summer Olympics, he became the oldest athlete ever to compete in the Olympics at the age of 72. His best results were in the team competitions: a fourth place in the single shot running deer event, and a second place in the double shot running deer contest. With this silver medal, he is also the oldest medallist of all time (not counting the art competitions).

In all of the Swedish shooting teams competitions that Oscar Swahn competed with at the Olympic games of 1908, 1912, and 1920, he competed alongside his son, Alfred Swahn.

<text>Ammon Ashford Hennacy (July 24, 1893 – January 14, 1970) was an American Christian pacifist, anarchist, Wobbly, social activist, and member of the Catholic Worker Movement. He established the Joe Hill House of Hospitality in Salt Lake City, Utah, and practiced tax resistance.

==Biography==
Hennacy was born in Negley, Ohio, to Quaker parents, Benjamin Frankin Hennacy and Eliza Eunice Fitz Randolph, and grew up as a Baptist. He studied at three different institutions, (a year at each one): Hiram College in Ohio in 1913, University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1914, and Ohio State University in 1915. 

During this time, Hennacy was a card-carrying member of the Socialist Party of America and in his words &quot;took military drills in order to learn how to kill capitalists.&quot; He was also the secretary of Hiram College&#x27;s Intercollegiate Socialist Society. 

At the outbreak of World War I, Hennacy was imprisoned for two years in Atlanta, Georgia, for resisting conscription. While in prison the only book he was allowed was the Bible. This inspired him to radically depart from his earlier beliefs; he became a Christian pacifist and a Christian anarchist. He led a hunger strike and was punished with eight months in solitary confinement.

Hennacy believed that adherence to Christianity required being a pacifist and, because governments constantly threaten or use force to resolve conflicts, this meant being an anarchist.
In 1919, Hennacy married his first wife, Selma Melms, under common law. He later described her as the &quot;daughter of the Socialist sheriff of Milwaukee, leader of the Yipsels, as the young Socialists were called, and secretary to the President of the State Federation of Labor.&quot; 

In May 1920, Hennacy graduated from the socialist Rand School of Social Science.
In 1921, Hennacy and Melms hiked around the United States, passing through all 48 of the contiguous states. He settled down in 1925, buying a farm and raising his two children. In 1931, he began social work in Milwaukee and organised one of the first social worker unions. 

He refused to use force or self-defense even when threatened during his work, preferring instead to use nonresistance. During this time, he also refused to sign up for the draft for World War II and declared that he would not pay taxes. He also reduced his tax liability by taking up a lifestyle of simple living. Between 1942 and 1953, Hennacy worked as a migrant farm labourer in the southwest United States.

In 1952, he was baptized as a Roman Catholic by Father Marion Casey at St. Anastasia Church, with Dorothy Day as his godmother. Hennacy moved to New York City in 1953, and became the associate editor of the &quot;Catholic Worker&quot; newspaper. Hennacy engaged in many picketing protests while in New York. At that time, he wrote a critical review of &quot;Witness&quot;, memoir of Whittaker Chambers, and later wrote more about his dislike of Chambers, whose wife Esther Shemitz his first wife Selma and he had known through the Rand School of Social Science. He illegally refused to participate in New York City&#x27;s annual air raid drills, and he picketed against the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s war preparations in Las Vegas, Cape Kennedy, Washington, D.C., and Omaha. In 1958, Hennacy fasted for 40 days in protest of nuclear weapons testing. 

In 1961, Hennacy moved to Utah and organised the Joe Hill House of Hospitality in Salt Lake City. While in Utah, Hennacy fasted and picketed in protest of the death penalty and the use of taxes in war. Following a divorce from Selma in 1964, Hennacy married his second wife, Joan Thomas, in 1965. In the same year he left the Roman Catholic Church, though he continued to call himself a &quot;non-church Christian&quot;. He was a member of the Industrial Workers of the World.

He wrote about his reasons for leaving and his thoughts on Catholicism, which included his belief that &quot;Paul spoiled the message of Christ&quot; (see Jesusism). He wrote about this in &quot;The Book of Ammon&quot; in 1965 (an updated version of his 1954 &quot;Autobiography of a Catholic Anarchist&quot;), which has been praised for its &quot;diamonds of insight and wisdom&quot; but criticised for its rambling style.

In 1968, Hennacy closed the &quot;Joe Hill House of Hospitality&quot; and turned his attention to further protest and writing. His second and last book, &quot;The One-Man Revolution in America&quot;, was published in 1970 and consists of seventeen chapters with each one devoted to an American radical. These included Thomas Paine, William Lloyd Garrison, John Woolman, Dorothy Day, Eugene Debs, Malcolm X, Mother Jones, Clarence Darrow, and Albert Parsons.

Ammon Hennacy died from a heart attack on January 14, 1970. His funeral was held at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Salt Lake City. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated and the ashes scattered over the graves of the Haymarket anarchists in Waldheim Cemetery in Chicago.

==Political and ethical beliefs==
Ammon Hennacy was a pacifist, a Christian anarchist, and an advocate of anarchism and nonresistance. He was extremely critical of what he described as the &quot;institutional church&quot; and state capitalism.

He did not drink or smoke and was a vegetarian. Much of his activism was anti-war, anti-nuclear proliferation, and against the death penalty.

Hennacy never paid federal income taxes because they pay for the military and war. He lived a life of voluntary simplicity and believed in what he called his &quot;One-Man Revolution&quot; against violence, sin, and coercion. He also refused to accept the legitimacy of the judiciary. Dorothy Day said &quot;Tolstoi and Gandhi, and Jesus became his teachers&quot;.

==Influence on folk==
When Ani DiFranco gathered stories by Utah Phillips to make the 1996 album &quot;The Past Didn&#x27;t Go Anywhere,&quot; she included his story about Hennacy, under the title &quot;Anarchy&quot;. Hennacy helped shape Phillips, who often told this story.

<doc id="960945" wikidata="Q6942612" url="?curid=960945" title="Musick Point">
<text>Musick Point Te Naupata (; officially Musick Point / Te Naupata) is the headland of the peninsula that forms the eastern shore of the Tāmaki River in Bucklands Beach, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. In 1942, Musick Point was named after Ed Musick, an aviator who visited New Zealand in 1937, although the headland is also known as &quot;Te Waiarohia&quot;, after an ancient Māori stronghold. Today, it is occupied by a golf club and the Musick Memorial Radio Station.

The peninsula itself terminates between the Motukorea Channel and the Tāmaki Strait in the Waitematā Harbour, Auckland. The residential areas of Bucklands Beach and Eastern Beach lie immediately to the south.

== History ==

The headland was originally used by Māori of the Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki iwi (tribe), who dug a ditch across the peninsula as part of Te Waiarohia Pā (sometimes recorded as Te Naupata Pa), until it was overrun by the neighbouring Ngāpuhi iwi in 1821. Parts of the ditch are still clearly visible. The beaches and the sea were plentiful sources of food for the local population.

In 1836, , including the point, were bought by William Thomas Fairburn, a missionary, for 90 blankets, 24 adzes, 24 hoes, 14 spades, 80 pounds (money), of tobacco, 24 combs, and 12 plain irons. The land was later parceled up and sold on. During the early settlers era it was called East Head, and until the 1930s it was known as Tāmaki Head.

Today, it is a favorite spot for walking, wedding photos, sightseeing over the harbour and for recreational fishing, as well as being the site of a golf course.

== Radio station ==

The increase in aircraft in the 1930s facilitated the need for international air communication in New Zealand. The headland was chosen due to its remote location in Auckland, leading to the construction of the Streamline Moderne style Musick Memorial Radio Station. The building was constructed in 1940 by DC Street Construction Company, however the events of World War II delayed the official opening of the station until 1942. The station was named after American pilot Ed Musick, whose landing of a Sikorsky S42B, the &quot;Samoan Clipper&quot;, in Mechanics Bay heralded the beginning of air travel and greater communication with the world for New Zealanders. Upon opening, the station facilitated most of the long range radio transmissions for Auckland, communicating with ships and aircraft, and was used by American naval forces during World War II. A secondary radio bunker was built 300m south of the main building during the war, in case the main station was bombed. Because the area was isolated a water tower was built to store water for the small group of houses and the single workers accommodation that was built at the same time as the station, about 500m to the south of the main radio building.

The isolation of Musick Point, with its absence of man-made electrical interference, made it an ideal radio receiving site and was a welcome improvement over Auckland Radio&#x27;s previous location in the Chief Post Office in downtown Auckland, which suffered interference from Auckland&#x27;s electric tramway. Transmitters for the radio station were established a few kilometres away from Musick Point, in Oliver Road, Bucklands Beach, with remote control by the operators at the Point.

The station was the headquarters of the maritime coast station Auckland Radio ZLD, and of aviation radio ZLF. ZLD and ZLF were initially operated by the New Zealand Post Office before the aviation radio service was taken over by the Civil Aviation Corporation, which moved it to Mangere Aerodrome (later Auckland Airport) in 1957. Later, ownership of Auckland Radio changed to Telecom NZ Ltd, and Spark still uses the building for cellular services.

Following the closure of all New Zealand coast radio stations in 1993, ZLD ceased operation from Musick Point and the land became Crown land. The equipment of Auckland Radio ZLD, including most of the Oliver Road transmitters, was acquired by the non-profit Musick Point Radio Group. The Group, which includes several former Musick Point operators and technicians, has a long-term lease on the building, and has reactivated the station on the amateur (ham) radio bands using some of the former ZLD transmitters along with a range of modern equipment. At a 2003 rededication of the building, a plaque recognizing the &quot;engineering heritage value&quot; of the station was presented by the Institute of Professional Engineers New Zealand.

In recognition of the station&#x27;s historical importance, the group has been issued the amateur radio callsigns ZL1ZLD and ZL1ZLF. The Group maintains a radio museum in the building and operates a low-power FM broadcast station with recorded information about Musick Point. One of MPRG&#x27;s projects was keeping the traditional marine radiotelegraph frequency of 512 kHz alive, and it had a special licence to operate on this frequency which is outside the normal amateur radio bands. These transmissions ceased in mid 2013 when amateurs were allocated a new 630 metre band (427–479 kHz) and authority to operate on 512 kHz was withdrawn.

<text>Bernnadette Stanis, also billed as Bern Nadette Stanis (born Bernadette Stanislaus, December 22, 1953), is an American actress and author. Stanis is best known for her role as Thelma Evans, the only daughter of Florida and James Evans Sr. on the CBS sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; which originally ran from 1974 to 1979. Stanis is the author of four books: &quot;Situations 101: Relationships, The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly&quot;; &quot;For Men Only&quot;; &quot;Situations 101: Finances&quot;; and &quot;The Last Night&quot;.

== Early life ==

One of five children, Stanis was born and raised in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York City. Her paternal grandparents were from Carriacou in the Grenadine Islands. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and later attended the Juilliard School. As a teen, Stanis entered Miss Black America pageants, and went on to become Miss Brooklyn, a title with which she became first runner-up in the Miss New York state pageant.

== Career ==
Stanis played the role of Thelma Ann Evans on the CBS sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; from February 1974 to August 1979. After the series ended, she made appearances on television shows including &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Happening Now!!&quot;. She and former co-star Jimmie Walker lent their voices to a radio spot for AT&amp;T, and Stanis went on to do a Nationwide Insurance commercial. Stanis has been featured in promotions for the TV One network, and in a &quot;Thelma&quot; promotion that aired September 19, 2009, alongside actress Anna Maria Horsford in the &quot;Battle of the Thelmas&quot; that aired their weddings from their respective TV series. (Horsford portrayed &quot;Thelma Frye&quot; in the TV series &quot;Amen&quot;.) During the &quot;Way Black Then&quot; promotions in February 2010 in honor of Black History Month, she and Walker appeared on the program &quot;Color TV&quot; to share their memories and thoughts on &quot;Good Times&quot;. She later appeared on the TV One show &quot;Life After&quot;. In July 2016, Stanis appeared on an episode of Centric&#x27;s &quot;Being&quot;, discussing her life and career.

== Personal life ==
Stanis has been married four times. Her first marriage was to high-school sweetheart Thomas Fauntleroy from June 1974 until 1978, then to Brooklyn nightclub owner Darnell Johnson in January 1979. Stanis&#x27; third marriage was to mechanical engineer Terrence Redd. Stanis gave birth to their daughter Dior Ravel circa April 1982. The couple later divorced. Her fourth husband is Kevin Fontana; an article in 2012 said they had been married 31 years, but other sources (cited above) state that Stanis was married to Redd circa 1981. Stanis also has a second child, daughter Brittany Rose. Stanis lives in Atlanta, Georgia with her children.

<doc id="960948" wikidata="Q809197" url="?curid=960948" title="Bart Gordon">
<text>Barton Jennings Gordon (born January 24, 1949) is an American politician and former U.S. Representative for , serving from 1985 until 2011. The district includes several rural areas and fast-growing suburbs east of Nashville. He was Chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology from 2007 until 2011. He is a member of the Democratic Party. He announced on December 14, 2009, that he would not seek re-election in 2010.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Gordon was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where he has lived all of his life. His father and grandfathers were farmers, and his mother was a teacher in the Rutherford County schools. He served in the United States Army Reserve in 1971 and 1972. He graduated cum laude from Middle Tennessee State University in 1971, where he was student body president, and earned a J.D. degree from the University of Tennessee College of Law in 1973. He is a member of the Kappa Alpha Order. He then entered private practice in Murfreesboro.

Active in Democratic politics early on, he was briefly executive director of the Tennessee Democratic Party in 1979 and state party chairman from 1981 to 1983.

== U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
When 6th District Congressman Al Gore announced in 1983 that he would run for the United States Senate in 1984, Gordon stepped down as state party chairman to run for the seat. He initially faced a hard-fought race against the brother of the publisher of Nashville&#x27;s former conservative newspaper, the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot;. However, he won handily in November 1984, riding Gore&#x27;s coattails in the midst of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide victory in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Gordon is regarded as a moderate. He has favored the repeal of the inheritance tax and the &quot;marriage tax penalty&quot;.

Gordon was re-elected by huge margins until 1994, when his Republican opponent was attorney Steve Gill, a former basketball player at the University of Tennessee who is now a radio talk show host. Gordon only won by one percentage point, but managed to defeat Gill more handily in 1996. Gordon was re-elected in 1998 and 2000 by margins similar to those he scored in the 1980s and early 1990s. He faced no significant opposition in 2002, 2004 and 2006 and was unopposed in 2008. This is largely because the 2002 reapportionment by the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly removed Williamson County, a wealthy and heavily Republican suburban area south of Nashville, from the 6th District and added it to the already heavily Republican 7th District. From 2003 to 2019, that district was held by Marsha Blackburn, a Williamson County resident who was Gordon&#x27;s opponent in 1992–the first time since his initial run for the seat that he faced a reasonably well-financed Republican challenger.

Even as Gordon continued to win reelection, the 6th began trending heavily Republican at the local level in the 1990s and 2000s. For instance, even with Gore atop the ticket as Bill Clinton&#x27;s running mate in 1996 and as presidential candidate in 2000, the Republican nominee for president carried the district in both elections. In addition to Nashville&#x27;s suburbs bleeding into the district, the more rural areas began shedding their &quot;Yellow Dog Democratic&quot; roots. The Republican trend in the district really manifested itself after Gordon&#x27;s retirement; his replacement as Democratic candidate, Brett Carter, only tallied 29.3 percent of the vote, barely half that of Republican State Senator Diane Black. No Democrat has crossed the 30 percent mark in the district since Gordon&#x27;s retirement.

===Tenure===
During his tenure in Congress, Gordon &quot;helped pass the COMPETES Act and the 2007 Energy Bill.&quot;

In December 2008, Gordon came under fire from Tennessee conservatives for failing to vote on the auto bailout, stating that his failure to vote was due to a &quot;technical glitch&quot; in the voting system. In March 2010, Gordon announced that he would vote in favor of the Senate Health Care bill.

Gordon has been the fastest runner of foot races in Congress for 20 years. Most recently, he defeated Congressman Aaron Schock, 33 years his younger at the Capital Challenge Charity Race.

Gordon voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act in November 2009 but voted for both the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 in March 2010.

In April 2009, Gordon voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.

==Post-congressional career==
Gordon is currently a partner in the global law firm K&amp;L Gates and is a distinguished fellow at the Council on Competitiveness. He was appointed by President Obama to the U.S. Antarctic Program Blue Ribbon Panel, the panel traveled to the Antarctic in December 2011 and put out the report “More and Better Science in Antarctica Through Increased Logistical Effectiveness” in July 2012. He is a member of the Brookings Leadership Advisory Board and is a project member for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences&#x27; New Models for U.S. Science and Technology Policy. He is a board member of the U.S Association of Former Members of Congress, and the Middle Tennessee State University Foundation and he is on the Board of Counselors for the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. He also is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

In 2012 Gordon was bestowed the insignia of Officer in the French Legion of Honor. He delivered the commencement keynote address and was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in May 2012. In May 2013, he received the first honorary doctorate given by his alma mater Middle Tennessee State University.

<doc id="960949" wikidata="Q545412" url="?curid=960949" title="Hurricane Beulah">
<text>Hurricane Beulah was an intense Category 5 hurricane which impacted the Greater Antilles, Mexico, and Texas in September 1967. The second tropical storm, second hurricane, only major hurricane, and strongest storm in the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Beulah tracked through the Caribbean, struck the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico as a major hurricane, and moved west-northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico, briefly becoming a Category 5 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the Rio Grande as a Category 3 hurricane. It spawned 115 tornadoes across Texas, which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone. Due to its slow movement over Texas, Beulah led to significant flooding. Throughout its path, at least 59 people were killed and total damage reached $234.6 million (1967 USD), of which $200 million occurred in the United States, $26.9 million occurred in Mexico, and $7.65 million occurred in the eastern Caribbean.

==Meteorological history==

On August 22, 1967, an ESSA-5 satellite image depicted an area of enhanced convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—east of the Western High Plateau in Cameroon over central Africa. Reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later, the tropical wave became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis. As it moved over west Africa, cyclonic rotation became apparent about above the surface. A research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of Africa; however, this significantly differs from the official Atlantic hurricane database, which does not mention the system at that time, as a surface circulation likely did not exist. Regardless, the system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean around 12°N on August 28, as represented by barometric pressure falls in Dakar, Senegal. Once over water, the system interacted with the Intertropical Convergence Zone and continued westward along an undulating path with no further organization. It was not until a United States Navy weather reconnaissance plane flew into the disturbance on September 4, while it was located east of the Lesser Antilles, that signs of development were apparent. Corresponding observations from ships in the region on September 5 confirmed the existence of a 1010 mbar (hPa; ) low-pressure area. In light of this, the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC that day, with its center situated roughly east-northeast of Barbados.

A slow-moving system, the depression steadily organized as it approached the Lesser Antilles. Observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00 UTC on September 7, resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm. It was also assigned the name &quot;Beulah&quot;, making it the second named storm of the 1967 season. Shortly after being named, Beulah clipped the southern coast of Martinique and entered the eastern Caribbean. Feeding off the warm waters of the Caribbean, the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached Category 1 hurricane intensity by 18:00 UTC on September 8. Rapid deepening ensued thereafter, with the storm&#x27;s central pressure falling to 940 mbar (hPa; ) the following day, as it passed south of Puerto Rico. At this time, 1-minute sustained winds were estimated to be at least , ranking Beulah as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). Upon reaching this strength, weather radar imagery from San Juan, Puerto Rico showed that Beulah featured a wide eye, surrounded by an intense eyewall about thick.
During the evening of September 9, Beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the Bahamas, between it and the newly formed Tropical Storm Doria. The powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape. During this phase, the inner-eye of Beulah contracted to roughly in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area across. The smaller eye soon dissipated, and the larger one became the single, dominant feature by the morning of September 10. The completion of this process marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety. The aforementioned westward turn placed the Dominican Republic in the line of danger, an area still reeling from the devastating effects of Hurricane Inez just one year prior. However, the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the Barahona Peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened, though still significant, Category 1 hurricane, with estimated winds of around 18:00 UTC on September 11.

Skirting the southern coast of Haiti&#x27;s Tiburon Peninsula, Beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of September 12. Unseasonably strong wind shear associated with the jet stream, resulting from an upper-level trough to the north, and the cyclone&#x27;s interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation. By the time it had cleared Haiti, Beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm, with sustained winds near . The storm&#x27;s central pressure had also risen by roughly 60 mbar (hPa; ) to 1000 mbar (hPa; ). Originally seen as a threat to Jamaica, northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on September 13. The shear previously impeding organization abated on September 14, and a ridge re-established itself to Beulah&#x27;s north, allowing the storm to resume a west-northwest to northwest track. The upper-level changes led to a favorable environment for intensification, and Beulah regained hurricane strength by 12:00 UTC on September 14, while located about south-southeast of Havana, Cuba.
Moving through the climatologically favorable western Caribbean, Beulah quickly regained Category 3 major hurricane status on September 15, with 1-minute sustained winds estimated at . The storm&#x27;s central pressure fell to on September 16, before some weakening took place. Beulah ultimately made landfall on Cozumel Island, with winds of at least later that day, and struck the mainland Yucatán Peninsula hours later. Despite moving over land, little weakening took place by the time the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico about 24 hours later. The hurricane maintained its intensity throughout September 18, as it moved west-northwest to southern Tamaulipas, Mexico. However, on September 19, a pronounced phase of rapid intensification, took place as Beulah turned northwest to the Rio Grande Valley region. Aircraft reconnaissance throughout the day found falling pressures and ultimately measured a value of 923 mbar (hPa; ) around 18:00 UTC. This was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded by aircraft at the time, behind a 920 mbar (hPa; ) measurement in Hurricane Hattie of 1961. Beulah was estimated to have achieved its peak intensity shortly thereafter, as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum 1-minute sustained winds estimated at .

Regarded as the third-largest hurricane on record at the time, Beulah moved along a slowing, erratic, and somewhat cycloidal path. Slight weakening ensued as it neared land and Beulah ultimately made its final landfall south of Brownsville, Texas, near the mouth of the Rio Grande around 13:00 UTC on September 20. No direct measurements exist at the core of the hurricane as it moved ashore; however, based on a minimum pressure of 951 mbar (hPa; ) in Brownsville, the hurricane likely struck land with a central pressure below that value. A vessel anchored in the Port of Brownsville measured peak wind gusts of , equivalent to a low-end Category 4 hurricane. According to the National Hurricane Center, Beulah struck as a Category 3 hurricane, and was originally thought to have had a central pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; ) at landfall, but a 2020 re-evaluation as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project lowered this to 940 mbar (). Once over land, the hurricane slowly weakened as it remained relatively close to the coast. Sustained winds dropped below hurricane-force on September 21, roughly 24 hours after landfall. The system subsequently stalled near Alice, Texas, before turning to the southwest. It was initially thought that, after diminishing to a tropical depression late on September 22, Beulah&#x27;s circulation finally dissipated over the mountainous terrain of Nuevo León, Mexico; however, the 2020 reanalysis concluded that Beulah survived through at least September 24, when it reemerged into the Gulf of Mexico, crossing the Mexican coast between the cities of Tampico and Tuxpan. Due to a lack of suitable observations, it is unknown how much longer after this Beulah continued to exist as a tropical depression over the southern Gulf of Mexico before degenerating into an open trough.

==Preparations==
===Hispaniola===
Following Beulah&#x27;s rapid intensification on September 9, a hurricane watch was issued for the whole of Hispaniola on September 9, with emphasis on a threat to the southern coast. Warnings were soon raised for areas between Barahona and Cabo Engaño in the Dominican Republic.

Across the Dominican Republic, an estimated 200,000 people evacuated from coastal areas.

===United States===
Beginning on the afternoon of September 17, people were advised to remain off the beaches of Padre, Mustang, and St. Joseph Islands. Immediate evacuation of Port Aransas and Mustang, Padre, and St. Joseph Islands was advised on the morning of September 19. Most residents and others on the islands evacuated, including the personnel of Padre Island National Seashore. About 40 persons remained on the islands, including about 20 at Port Aransas. Immediate evacuation of Rockport and Live Oak and Lamar Peninsulas was advised in the evening of September 19. These areas and the towns of Ingleside and Aransas Pass were nearly completely evacuated. About 50 persons remained in Rockport. The evacuation of the University of Corpus Christi was advised on the morning of September 20, and Corpus Christi Beach and parts of Flour Bluff were also evacuated. During the storm there were 30,000 people in shelters in Nueces and San Patricio Counties, including 6,000 in Corpus Christi.

==Impact==

===Eastern Caribbean===

Prior to Beulah, a stationary trough over the Lesser Antilles produced torrential rainfall throughout the region, setting the stage for significant flooding. On September 7, Beulah brought torrential rains to the already saturated region, with reports of more than received by the Weather Bureau. The French West Indies, and especially Martinique, suffering the brunt of the storm. During an 18‑hour span, fell on the island. Severe flooding claimed 15 lives on Martinique and destroyed many homes. Parts of Fort-de-France were inundated by of water while the Martinique International Airport saw of flooding. The banana crop sustained extensive losses. Across the island nearly 1,000 residents were left homeless, including 400 in Fort-de-France. Damage on the island amounted to $4.5 million. Supplies of fresh water were severely limited for two days following the storm.

Heavy rains triggered flooding and landslides across St. Vincent, blocking numerous roads and causing some damage. Two children were killed after a boulder, dislodged by the rains, crashed into their home. Damage on St. Lucia reached $3 million, mainly stemming from the banana crop which was largely ruined. The periphery of the hurricane brought rainfall primarily to southwestern Puerto Rico, where a maximum of fell at Maricao. One person lost their life on the island and damage was a minimal $150,000.

Owing to effective evacuations, only two people lost their lives in the Dominican Republic. The core of Beulah impacted areas devastated by Hurricane Inez a year prior, leaving extensive damage in its wake. Media reports indicated that more than 1,000 people were left homeless across the Barahona Peninsula. Flash flooding affected the southern coasts of both the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

Beulah had limited impact on Jamaica as it brushed the island as a weak tropical storm. According to newspapers, gale-force winds affected the nation though there were no reports of damage.

===Mexico===

Striking Cozumel Island and the Yucatán Peninsula on September 17 as a Category 2 hurricane, Beulah caused considerable damage and killed 11 people across the region. Wind gusts up to severed communication lines, downed power lines and felled trees. The Puerto Morelos lighthouse on the Riviera Maya was undermined by the storm; it was never torn down and the leaning tower remains a tourist attraction in the area. In Mérida, Yucatán, winds were recorded up to . Under the force of the powerful winds, several structures collapsed across the Peninsula, resulting in six fatalities. Nearly every buildings on Cozumel Island sustained damage, roughly half of which lost their roofs. Four people were also killed in Playa del Carmen. Along the coast, Beulah&#x27;s storm surge flooded areas within of the coastline, washing out roads and leaving &quot;graveyards of boats.&quot; Throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, an estimated 5,000 people were left homeless and at least 30,000 were affected by the storm.

Throughout Mexico, Beulah killed 19 people. Economic losses across Tampico reached 500 million pesos. Across the Yucatán Peninsula, the Government of Mexico set up an air lift of food and medical supplies to isolated areas by September 18.

===United States===
In Texas upon landfall, an storm surge inundated lower Padre Island. The force of the storm tide made 31 cuts completely through the barrier island. Padre Island suffered significant devastation, and the island&#x27;s sensitive ecosystem was altered by the storm. The highest sustained wind was reported as , recorded in the town of South Padre Island, across the Laguna Madre from Port Isabel. Winds as high as were measured at the Brownsville National Weather Service office at landfall. Since the hurricane bent the anemometer 30 degrees from the vertical, it is possible the winds at Brownsville were underestimated. Gusts of over were recorded as far inland as the towns of McAllen, Edinburg, Mission, and Pharr, some from the gulf coast. Beulah spawned a record 115 tornadoes which destroyed homes, commercial property, and inflicted serious damage on the region&#x27;s agricultural industry. The tornado record from Beulah would survive until Hurricane Ivan set a new record in 2004. The Rio Grande Valley&#x27;s citrus industry, based on cultivation of the famous &quot;Ruby Red&quot; grapefruit, was particularly hard hit.
The lower Rio Grande Valley, the four-county region that comprises deep south Texas, was inundated with torrential rains. Within a 36‑hour period, the hurricane dropped over of rain near Beeville, Texas. Falfurrias received more rain from Beulah than it normally records during one year. Areas south of Laredo, San Antonio, and Matagorda were isolated for more than a week due to the resulting flood. On September 28, President Lyndon Baines Johnson declared twenty-four counties in southern Texas a disaster area.

Animal life in the region responded in various ways to survive. Ants survived the floods by congregating in spheres of living colonies and floated down streams to safety. Predaceous beetle larvae preyed on frogs and rodents. Crustaceans from the beaches migrated en masse to the protection of high ground.

Hurricane Beulah caused an estimated US$200 million in damage. Sources report 15 total deaths in Texas from the storm.

==Retirement==

Due to the number of fatalities and extensive damage the system caused from the Lesser Antilles to Texas, the name &quot;Beulah&quot; was retired following the 1967 season, and will never be used for an Atlantic basin tropical cyclone again. It was replaced with &quot;Beth&quot; for the 1971 season.

<doc id="960956" wikidata="Q7409170" url="?curid=960956" title="Same-sex marriage in Quebec">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Quebec since March 19, 2004 in accordance with a ruling from the Quebec Court of Appeal that the heterosexual definition of marriage violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Quebec was the third Canadian province after Ontario and British Columbia and the fifth jurisdiction in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples.

==Court ruling==
In 2000, Michael Hendricks and René Leboeuf applied for a marriage licence, but were turned down by a clerk who read out the sections of provincial law that defined marriage as being between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;. After the rejection, they filed suit against the Government of Quebec, alleging that its refusal to perform and recognise same-sex marriage violated the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; (&quot;Charte canadienne des droits et libertés&quot;). Two conservative organisations, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada and the Catholic Civil Rights League, were granted intervenor status in the case, &quot;Hendricks and Leboeuf v. Quebec&quot;. The lawsuit was heard in the Quebec Superior Court on 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 November 2001. The provincial and federal governments had initially opposed the court bid; provincial Attorney General Paul Bégin argued that &quot;gays and lesbians were not suffering any form of discrimination in [Quebec]&quot;, while federal Attorney General Anne McLellan argued that the definition of marriage was at the Parliament of Canada&#x27;s discretion and not a matter for the courts to decide. A lawyer representing the conservative religious groups argued that if the court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage &quot;[h]is heterosexual clients would no longer be able to marry. That is because, to them, marriage is a heterosexual institution.&quot; Daniel Cere, a Catholic professor at McGill University, who filed an affidavit for the court, said that same-sex marriage &quot;would fracture the basis of shared religious and civil peace in the province&quot;. Rabbi David Novak also filed an affidavit for the court, stating that same-sex marriage would &quot;create a schism between Jews and the rest of society&quot;, and said that Judaism &quot;expect[ed] them [gay people] to remain celibate for life&quot;. Other affidavits from religious groups included one from an anonymous Muslim imam, stating that same-sex marriage &quot;would invalidate Muslim beliefs, preventing Muslims from full participation in Canadian society&quot;, while one from a conservative Protestant professor at Regent College said that same-sex marriage &quot;would drive a stake into the heart of Protestant beliefs&quot;.

Attorney Noël Saint-Pierre argued that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples constituted unfair discrimination as they were unable to access many legal benefits often taken for granted by married opposite-sex couples, such as alimony, immigration rights, child support, hospital visitation rights, and protection from domestic violence, among others. Saint-Pierre also refuted the religious groups&#x27; claims, citing the Netherlands, where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2001: &quot;The fears of the religious conservatives did not materialize. Christians did not stop marrying. Jews did not flee the country.&quot; Judge Louise Lemelin ruled in the couple&#x27;s favour on September 6, 2002. The court gave the federal government two years in which to modify federal law to allow gays and lesbians to marry. A lawyer representing the plaintiff couple told the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;:
The federal government filed an appeal of the decision of the Superior Court on September 9, 2002, but abandoned that appeal in 2003, the year same-sex marriage was legalized in Ontario and British Columbia. The case continued, with the group of religious conservatives opposing the plaintiffs&#x27; claims. The group argued that the legalisation of same-sex marriage was unconstitutional under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, would prevent heterosexual couples from marrying and would &quot;weaken the meaning of marriage&quot;. On March 19, 2004, the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled similarly to the Ontario and British Columbia courts, upholding &quot;Hendricks and Leboeuf&quot; in a unanimous 5–0 vote, and ordering that it take effect immediately. Hendricks and Leboeuf immediately sought a marriage licence; the usual 20-day waiting period was waived, and they were wed on April 1 at the Palais de justice in Montreal. Hendricks said, &quot;The floodgates seem to be open and it looks like Canada is going to become the first North American country that has equal marriage... This is wonderful.&quot; Following the court decision, provincial Attorney General Marc Bellemare announced that the government would abide by the ruling. The Quebec decision meant that more than two-thirds of the Canadian population were living in provinces where same-sex marriage is legal. Subsequent cases, as well as federal legislation, have expanded this number to cover the entire country.

==Provincial legislation==
===Civil unions===

In 2002, the National Assembly of Quebec unanimously passed a bill legalising civil unions for both same-sex and opposite-sex partners, offering many of the same rights, benefits and responsibilities as marriage, including the right to adopt children jointly. Civil unions are performed by court clerks, notaries, mayors, members of municipal councils or borough councils, municipal officials or authorised religious officiants. Once the document is signed by both partners and the witnesses, the union is formally registered with the Director of Civil Status. Quebec civil unions are not recognised in other parts of Canada or other countries.

===Marriage===
In November 2004, the National Assembly enacted &quot;An Act to amend the Civil Code as regards marriage&quot; (), amending the Civil Code of Quebec to replace references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with &quot;spouses&quot; and permit civil unions to be converted to marriages. Quebec became the first province in Canada to bring its laws in line with the legalisation of same-sex marriage and add a gender-neutral definition of spouse in its marriage laws.

==Marriage and civil union statistics==
From 2004 to 2023, 11,087 same-sex marriages were performed in Quebec, representing about 2.5% of all marriages contracted during that time. There were also 1,282 same-sex civil unions performed during this same time period, representing about 20% of all civil unions.

Between 2004 and 2008, 17% of same-sex marriages were between couples from other provinces or territories, or from the United States. The following table shows the number of marriages and civil unions performed in Quebec as per data published by the Institut de la statistique du Québec. Figures for 2020 and 2021 are lower than previous years because of the restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Religious performance==
Several dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada allow their clergy to bless and perform same-sex marriages. In 2008, the synod of the Diocese of Montreal voted to allow its parishes to bless same-sex unions. The measure includes a freedom of conscience clause for clergy opposed to blessing same-sex unions. In July 2016, Bishop Mary Irwin-Gibson said she would allow her clergy to perform same-sex marriages. The Diocese of Ottawa, which encompasses parts of western Quebec, including the Outaouais region, has also allowed solemnisations of same-sex marriages since 2016. The Diocese of Quebec has allowed blessings of same-sex unions since 2012. Bishop Bruce Myers expressed disappointment in July 2019 when the Anglican Church of Canada narrowly rejected a motion to approve same-sex marriage. On 24 November 2019, the synod of the Diocese of Quebec voted 37–6 to request Bishop Myers to authorise the solemnisation of same-sex marriages. In response to the request, Myers said, &quot;You&#x27;ll here more from me, because… what this motion also expects is that I will come back to the diocese with some specifics around how such a request would be implemented, and being clear about things like safeguards for those who do not wish to exercise and offer this ministry.&quot; On the other hand, same-sex marriages are not performed in the Diocese of Moosonee, which encompasses the northwestern Eeyou Istchee communities. The marriage canon of the Anglican Church of Canada serves as the canon on marriage in the diocese. Similarly, the Diocese of The Arctic, encompassing the northern Nunavik region, does not allow its parishes to perform same-sex marriages.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council.

==Public opinion==
A 2017 CROP poll showed that Quebec had the highest popular support for same-sex marriage in Canada, at 80%. Nationwide, 74% of Canadians found it &quot;great that in Canada, two people of the same sex can get married&quot;, while 26% disagreed.

<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in British Columbia since July 8, 2003, after a series of court rulings in &quot;Barbeau v. British Columbia&quot; which ultimately landed in favour of same-sex couples seeking marriage licences. This made British Columbia the second province in Canada, the second jurisdiction in North America and the fourth in the world, after the Netherlands, Belgium and Ontario, to legalise same-sex marriage.

==Legal history==
===Background===
On July 4, 1995, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia approved the &quot;Adoption Act&quot;, permitting cohabiting same-sex couples to adopt children jointly. British Columbia became the first province in Canada to allow same-sex couples to adopt. The law took effect on November 4, 1996.

In July 1997, the New Democratic Party government of Premier Glen Clark introduced bills to recognise &quot;the marriage-like relationship between persons of the same gender&quot; in the &quot;Family Relations Act&quot; and the &quot;Family Maintenance Enforcement Act&quot;, granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married spouses with regard to child custody and maintenance. Despite opposition from religious groups, the bills were passed overwhelmingly in the Legislative Assembly, and received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Garde Gardom.

===&quot;Barbeau v. British Columbia&quot;===
====Judgement====
In July 2001, eight same-sex couples filed a lawsuit in court, &quot;Barbeau v. British Columbia&quot;, arguing that banning same-sex marriage violated the &quot;Charter&quot; rights of gays and lesbians. On October 2, 2001, British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Pitfield ruled against same-sex marriage, arguing it was not allowed under the Canadian Constitution. &quot;Parliament may not enact legislation to change the legal meaning of marriage to include same-sex unions,&quot; he said. &quot;I concur in the submission of the Attorney General of Canada that the core distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships is so material in the Canadian context that no means exist by which to equate same-sex relationships to marriage while at the same time preserving the fundamental importance of marriage to the community.&quot; Justice Pitfield would be the sole judge in Canada to rule against same-sex couples. The couples appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal.

On May 1, 2003, justices of the British Columbia Court of Appeal ruled 3–0 that the denial of marriage licences to same-sex couples was a violation of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. &quot;Gay rights have steadily expanded since homosexuality was made legal in Canada in 1969, and these developments have substantial public support, although the matter remains controversial,&quot; the court wrote. &quot;This evolution cannot be ignored. Civil marriage should adapt to contemporary notions of marriage as an institution in a society which recognizes the rights of homosexual persons to non-discriminatory treatment.&quot; The court gave the Government of Canada until July 2, 2004 to change the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, similar to the ruling issued in Ontario. On July 8, 2003, the Court of Appeal issued another ruling, lifting the stay it had put on the government in its May decision. The court said it was &quot;satisfied&quot; and noted the Ontario Court of Appeal lifting the stay in its own ruling in June 2003. The ruling stated that &quot;any further delay will result in an unequal application of the law between Ontario and British Columbia.&quot; A few hours after the Court of Appeal ruling, Antony Porcino and Tom Graff became the first two men to be legally wed in British Columbia. Two conservative religious groups attempted to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada but, as they only had party intervenor status in the case, their attempt was unsuccessful. Several of the plaintiff couples, many of whom had been in a relationship for decades, announced they would marry in the coming months or year.

====Reactions and aftermath====
Craig Maynard, spokesman for Egale Canada, said that they &quot;are thrilled by this decision&quot;, and said they would continue to push for the legalisation of same-sex marriage across Canada. Kathleen Lahey, who was a counsel to the couples, said that the court decision &quot;confirms that the new federal law on same-sex marriage applies uniformly across the country -- and immediately. It also makes it clear that other provinces can and should act now to extend marriage to lesbian and gay couples, instead of putting the issue off until the Supreme Court of Canada and Parliament have confirmed the new law.&quot; A spokesperson for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver said the diocese was &quot;saddened&quot; by the decision, &quot;We&#x27;re also concerned that the courts have taken over the role of legislating in our democracy. This way of making important public decisions is very wrong. A third point of concern is the impact this will have on churches and religious freedom. The prime minister has given a guarantee with respect to religious freedom, but he can&#x27;t give us a guarantee with respect to what the courts might do&quot;, the spokesperson said. Anglican Bishop Michael Ingham said he was &quot;glad gay and lesbian people are receiving recognition of their equality rights&quot;, but that the church would &quot;still regard marriage as a union between husband and wife&quot;: &quot;It goes considerably further than the church has gone. We have spoken of unions and not marriage. That remains the position of our diocese. I&#x27;m glad gay and lesbian people are receiving recognition of their equality rights, but it goes beyond where we are in the church. We still regard marriage as a union between husband and wife.&quot;

In August 2003, Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson married in Yaletown. They returned to England and demanded that it recognise their marriage. This was the beginning of the marriage equality movement in the United Kingdom, but the High Court of Justice ruled against the couple in July 2006.

On June 15, 2005, a B.C. Supreme Court judge in Nanaimo granted British Columbia&#x27;s first same-sex divorce in the case of &quot;J.S. v. C.F.&quot;. Although same-sex marriage had been legal in British Columbia for two years, the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; still defined marriage as being &quot;between a man and a woman&quot;. The judge, Madame Justice Laura Gerow, with the consent of the Attorney General, Irwin Cotler, changed the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; to include same-sex couples.

===Provincial legislation===
On November 23, 2011, the Legislative Assembly enacted the &quot;Family Law Act&quot;, which uses gender-neutral language with regard to married spouses. The Assembly also amended the &quot;Marriage Act&quot; to replace all references to &quot;husband and wife&quot; with &quot;spouses&quot; and to add &quot;or spouse&quot; in section 20(c). The legislation, which received royal assent by Lieutenant Governor Steven Point, amended provincial law to read that each of the parties to a marriage, in the presence of a marriage commissioner and at least two witnesses, says to the other:
==Two-spirit marriages==
While there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in First Nations cultures, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. Many of these cultures recognised two-spirit individuals who were born male but wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. This two-spirit status allowed for marriages between two biological males or two biological females to be performed in some of these tribes.

The Nuxalk believed that two-spirit people were influenced in &quot;some mysterious way&quot; by the supernatural figure (). Born male, they wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed women&#x27;s tasks, and, unlike most two-spirit people in other Native cultures, would form long-lasting relationships with cisgender women and marry. The Haida people call two-spirit individuals (), and the Tsimshian call them (). They are known as () in Halkomelem. Stó꞉lō intersex babies were sometimes left on Mount McGuire to die; &quot;[Elders] couldn&#x27;t tell its sex till about three years old; they didn&#x27;t let them live unles [&quot;sic&quot;] found out only after grown, i.e. about three year old; the Chilliwacks left them to die up the mountain they called &quot;Tʼamiyahó:y&quot;.&quot; The Nuu-chah-nulth refer to two-spirit individuals who were born male but adopted women&#x27;s roles in the community as (), whereas individuals who were born female but adopted men&#x27;s roles are known as ().

The Kutenai refer to two-spirit people who were born female but wore men&#x27;s clothing and performed men&#x27;s activities as (). One famous Kutenai two-spirit person was Kaúxuma Núpika, who, after leaving his White fur trader husband, returned to his people and adopted men&#x27;s clothing and weapons, and took a wife. Kaúxuma was one of the &quot;principal leaders&quot; of the tribe and supernatural powers were attributed to him. He &quot;is remembered among the Kutenai as a respected shamanic healer&quot;, a masculine occupation. The Kutenai also recognise male-bodied two-spirit people who wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed women&#x27;s activities. They would &quot;participate in gathering berries [and] roots, and also in making baskets and mats, in preparing lily seeds for consumption, and in cooking meals&quot;, and would marry men. This two-spirit status thus allowed for marriages between two biological males or two biological females to be performed in Kutenai society.

==Marriage statistics==
735 same-sex marriages were performed in British Columbia in 2003. Most were between persons who resided in the United States rather than in Canada. British Columbia has become a popular marriage destination for same-sex couples, and Vancouver was listed in the &quot;Top 10 Gay Wedding Destinations&quot; by Lonely Planet in 2014.

The 2016 Canadian census showed that there were 11,230 same-sex couples living in British Columbia.

==Religious performance==
Several dioceses of the Anglican Church of Canada allow their clergy to bless and perform same-sex marriages. The Diocese of British Columbia has authorised its clergy to bless same-sex civil marriages since 2013. In autumn 2016, Bishop Logan McMenamie announced at a diocesan synod meeting that he will &quot;move forward with the marriage of same-sex couples in the diocese&quot;. Following the passage of a resolution known as &quot;A Word to the Church&quot; by the synod of the Anglican Church of Canada in July 2019, allowing its dioceses to choose whether to perform same-sex marriages, the bishops of the dioceses of New Westminster and Kootenay announced that clergy would be permitted to officiate at same-sex marriages from 1 August 2019. The measures include a freedom of conscience clause for clergy opposed to performing same-sex marriages. Pastoral arrangements are made if a same-sex couple wishes to marry in their home congregation and their priest has decided not to officiate at such marriages. The Territory of the People also allows its clergy to solemnise same-sex marriages. On the other hand, the Diocese of Caledonia, encompassing parts of northern British Columbia, does not perform same-sex marriages. Its marriage canons state that &quot;it shall be the duty of the officiating clergyman to ensure that Canon XXVII on Marriage in the Church enacted by the 23rd Session of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada is followed in its entirety&quot;.

Some other religious organisations also perform same-sex marriages in their places of worship, including the United Church of Canada, Quakers, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, and the Canadian Unitarian Council. In 2021, the Artisan Church left the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches due to the denomination&#x27;s opposition to same-sex marriage. The congregation in Vancouver had decided to permit same-sex marriages, which proved highly controversial in the Mennonite Brethren denomination.

==Public opinion==
A June 12 – July 6, 2003 Environics Research poll found a 53%–43% margin nationwide in favour of same-sex marriage. The poll concluded that British Columbia had one of the highest levels of support in the country, but did not give a figure.

A December 14 – January 5, 2005 Environics Research poll found a 54%–43% margin nationwide in favour of same-sex marriage. 214 British Columbians were surveyed in the poll, and 60% of respondents said they were in favour of same-sex marriage, while 38% were opposed.

<text>Samoan Clipper was one of ten Pan American Airways Sikorsky S-42 flying boats. It exploded near Pago Pago, American Samoa, on January 11, 1938, while piloted by aviator Edwin Musick. Musick and his crew of six died in the crash. The aircraft was carrying only airmail and express freight; no passengers were aboard.

The aircraft developed an oil leak shortly after taking off from Pago Pago harbor, and the crew decided to return to port. However, the S-42, fully loaded with fuel, was too heavy to land safely in the limited space of the harbor, so the crew elected to dump fuel before landing. While fuel dumping was in progress, there was a fire and explosion which destroyed the aircraft, killing all aboard. The exact cause of ignition for the fire could not be determined.

<doc id="960972" wikidata="Q903255" url="?curid=960972" title="Schoenflies notation">
<text>The Schoenflies (or Schönflies) notation, named after the German mathematician Arthur Moritz Schoenflies, is a notation primarily used to specify point groups in three dimensions. Because a point group alone is completely adequate to describe the symmetry of a molecule, the notation is often sufficient and commonly used for spectroscopy. However, in crystallography, there is additional translational symmetry, and point groups are not enough to describe the full symmetry of crystals, so the full space group is usually used instead. The naming of full space groups usually follows another common convention, the Hermann–Mauguin notation, also known as the international notation.

Although Schoenflies notation without superscripts is a pure point group notation, optionally, superscripts can be added to further specify individual space groups. However, for space groups, the connection to the underlying symmetry elements is much more clear in Hermann–Mauguin notation, so the latter notation is usually preferred for space groups.

==Symmetry elements==
Symmetry elements are denoted by i for centers of inversion, C for proper rotation axes, σ for mirror planes, and S for improper rotation axes (rotation-reflection axes). C and S are usually followed by a subscript number (abstractly denoted n) denoting the order of rotation possible.

By convention, the axis of proper rotation of greatest order is defined as the principal axis. All other symmetry elements are described in relation to it. A vertical mirror plane (containing the principal axis) is denoted σv; a horizontal mirror plane (perpendicular to the principal axis) is denoted σh.

==Point groups==
In three dimensions, there are an infinite number of point groups, but all of them can be classified by several families. 

* &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; (for cyclic) has an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation axis. 
** &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;h is &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; with the addition of a mirror (reflection) plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (&quot;horizontal plane&quot;). 
** &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;v is &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot; with the addition of &quot;n&quot; mirror planes containing the axis of rotation (&quot;vertical planes&quot;). 
* &quot;C&quot;s denotes a group with only mirror plane (for &quot;Spiegel&quot;, German for mirror) and no other symmetry elements. 
* &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; (for &quot;Spiegel&quot;, German for mirror) contains only a &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation-reflection axis. The index, &quot;n&quot;, should be even because when it is odd an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation-reflection axis is equivalent to a combination of an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation axis and a perpendicular plane, hence &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;h for odd &quot;n&quot;.
* &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;i has only a rotoinversion axis. This notation is rarely used because any rotoinversion axis can be expressed instead as rotation-reflection axis: For odd &quot;n&quot;, &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;i = &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot; and &quot;C&quot;2&quot;n&quot;i = &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;C&quot;&quot;n&quot;h, and for even &quot;n&quot;, &quot;C&quot;2&quot;n&quot;i = &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;. Only the notation &quot;C&quot;i (meaning &quot;C&quot;1i) is commonly used, and some sources write &quot;C&quot;3i, &quot;C&quot;5i etc.
* &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; (for dihedral, or two-sided) has an &quot;n&quot;-fold rotation axis plus &quot;n&quot; twofold axes perpendicular to that axis. 
** &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;h has, in addition, a horizontal mirror plane and, as a consequence, also &quot;n&quot; vertical mirror planes each containing the &quot;n&quot;-fold axis and one of the twofold axes.
** &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;d has, in addition to the elements of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; vertical mirror planes which pass between twofold axes (&quot;diagonal planes&quot;).
* &quot;T&quot; (the chiral tetrahedral group) has the rotation axes of a tetrahedron (three 2-fold axes and four 3-fold axes). 
** &quot;T&quot;d includes diagonal mirror planes (each diagonal plane contains only one twofold axis and passes between two other twofold axes, as in &quot;D&quot;2d). This addition of diagonal planes results in three improper rotation operations S4.
** &quot;T&quot;h includes three horizontal mirror planes. Each plane contains two twofold axes and is perpendicular to the third twofold axis, which results in inversion center i.
* &quot;O&quot; (the chiral octahedral group) has the rotation axes of an octahedron or cube (three 4-fold axes, four 3-fold axes, and six diagonal 2-fold axes).
** &quot;O&quot;h includes horizontal mirror planes and, as a consequence, vertical mirror planes. It contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
* &quot;I&quot; (the chiral icosahedral group) indicates that the group has the rotation axes of an icosahedron or dodecahedron (six 5-fold axes, ten 3-fold axes, and 15 2-fold axes).
** &quot;I&quot;h includes horizontal mirror planes and contains also inversion center and improper rotation operations.
All groups that do not contain more than one higher-order axis (order 3 or more) can be arranged as shown in a table below; symbols in red are rarely used.

In crystallography, due to the crystallographic restriction theorem, &quot;n&quot; is restricted to the values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. The noncrystallographic groups are shown with grayed backgrounds. &quot;D&quot;4d and &quot;D&quot;6d are also forbidden because they contain improper rotations with &quot;n&quot; = 8 and 12 respectively. The 27 point groups in the table plus &quot;T&quot;, &quot;T&quot;d, &quot;T&quot;h, &quot;O&quot; and &quot;O&quot;h constitute 32 crystallographic point groups. 

Groups with &quot;n = ∞&quot; are called limit groups or Curie groups. There are two more limit groups, not listed in the table: &quot;K&quot; (for &quot;Kugel&quot;, German for ball, sphere), the group of all rotations in 3-dimensional space; and &quot;K&quot;h, the group of all rotations and reflections. In mathematics and theoretical physics they are known respectively as the &quot;special orthogonal group&quot; and the &quot;orthogonal group&quot; in three-dimensional space, with the symbols SO(3) and O(3).

== Space groups ==
The space groups with given point group are numbered by 1, 2, 3, ... (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the corresponding point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is &quot;C&quot;2 have Schönflies symbols &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;. 

While in case of point groups, Schönflies symbol defines the symmetry elements of group unambiguously, the additional superscript for space group doesn&#x27;t have any information about translational symmetry of space group (lattice centering, translational components of axes and planes), hence one needs to refer to special tables, containing information about correspondence between Schönflies and Hermann–Mauguin notation. Such table is given in List of space groups page.

<text>James Hayes Shofner Cooper (born June 19, 1954) is an American lawyer, businessman, professor, and politician who served as the U.S. representative for (based in Nashville and containing parts of Davidson, Cheatham, and Dickson Counties) from 2003 to 2023. He is a Southern Democrat and was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, and represented from 1983 to 1995. His district included all of Nashville. He chaired the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the House Armed Services Committee, and sat on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, United States House Committee on the Budget, and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, more committees than any other member of Congress. At the end of his tenure, he was also the dean of Tennessee&#x27;s congressional delegation. Cooper is the third-longest serving member of Congress ever from Tennessee, after Jimmy Quillen and B. Carroll Reece.

Due to Cooper&#x27;s rare split tenure in Congress in two entirely different districts, his career was divided in two fields: regulatory and health care legislation in the rural 4th district and military affairs in the urban 5th.

Cooper built seniority and respect on two different sets of committees, becoming what &quot;The New York Times&quot; op-ed writer Joe Nocera called &quot;the conscience of the House, a lonely voice for civility in this ugly era.&quot;

Cooper announced that he would not seek reelection in 2022 after accusing Tennessee&#x27;s Republican-led state legislature of partisan gerrymandering in the redistricting cycle. The new congressional map, which split Davidson County into 3 separate districts, turned TN-5 from a Democratic-leaning seat into a Republican one. Cooper was succeeded by Republican Andy Ogles.

== Early life, education, and legal career ==
Cooper was born in Nashville and raised in Shelbyville, Tennessee. He is the son of former governor Prentice Cooper and his wife Hortense (Powell). His paternal grandfather, William Prentice Cooper, served as mayor of Shelbyville and speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives. The Cooper family owns the River Side Farmhouse, built for his great-great-grandfather, Jacob Morton Shofner, in 1890; the Gov. Prentice Cooper House, built for his grandfather in 1904; and the 1866 Absalom Lowe Landis House in Normandy, Tennessee, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cooper attended the Episcopal boys&#x27; boarding school Groton School in Groton, Massachusetts, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Alpha Sigma chapter of the Chi Psi fraternity, received the Morehead-Cain Scholarship, and earned a B.A. in history with highest honors and honors in economics in three years. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford, where he was a member of Oriel College and earned a B.A./M.A. in philosophy, politics and economics in 1977. In 1980, he received a J.D. from Harvard Law School.

Cooper spent two years working for the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch &amp; Davis, LLP in Nashville, and then ran for Congress in 1982.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1983–1995)==
===Elections===
====1982====
In 1982, Cooper won the Democratic primary for the 4th district, which had been created when Tennessee gained a district after the 1980 census. The new 4th ran diagonally across the state, from heavily Republican areas near the Tri-Cities, Knoxville and Chattanooga to the fringes of the Nashville suburbs. The district stretched across five media markets – the Tri-Cities (Kingsport, Johnson City, and Bristol), Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Huntsville, Alabama. The district touched four states – Virginia, Kentucky, Alabama, and Mississippi – and nearly touched North Carolina and Georgia.

Cooper defeated Cissy Baker, an editor in Washington for CNN and the daughter of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker, with 66% of the vote, becoming the youngest member of Congress at age 28.

Cooper was reelected five more times with little substantive opposition, running unopposed in 1986 and 1988. Before Cooper&#x27;s election, much of the eastern portion of the 4th had not been represented by a Democrat since the Civil War.

===Tenure===
In 1992, Cooper co-authored a bipartisan health-care reform plan that did not include employer mandates compelling universal coverage. Called &quot;Clinton-Lite&quot;, this initiative was strongly opposed by Hillary Clinton despite its strong backing from both parties.

In 1990, Cooper was one of only three House Democrats to vote against the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

===Committee assignments===
During Cooper&#x27;s first period in Congress, he served first on the Financial Services Committee and then on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.

With Representative Fred Grandy and Senator John Breaux, Cooper coauthored the Cooper-Breaux bipartisan health reform plan, which dramatically increased health insurance coverage with the support of the business community.

Cooper became the leading expert on rural electrical cooperatives, later authoring &quot;Electric Co-operatives: From New Deal to Bad Deal?&quot; in the &quot;Harvard Journal on Legislation&quot;.

==1994 U.S. Senate election==

In 1994, Cooper ran for the Senate seat vacated by Al Gore&#x27;s election to the Vice Presidency in 1992, but lost to Republican attorney and actor Fred Thompson. Cooper received just under 40% of the vote. It was a bad year overall for Democrats in Tennessee, as Republican Bill Frist won Tennessee&#x27;s other Senate seat held by Jim Sasser and Don Sundquist was elected governor. The 4th district seat was also won by a Republican, Van Hilleary, as the GOP gained a majority of the state&#x27;s congressional delegation for only the second time since Reconstruction.

==Inter-congressional years (1995–2003)==

After losing his Senate bid, Cooper moved to Nashville and became an investment banker at Equitable Securities. Later, he co-founded Brentwood Capital Advisors, a boutique investment bank based in Nashville. He also served as an adjunct professor at Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Owen Graduate School of Management until 2015.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2003–2023)==
===Elections===
====2002====

When Thompson opted not to run for reelection to the Senate in 2002, 5th district Congressman Bob Clement (with whom Cooper had served from 1988 to 1995) ran for Thompson&#x27;s seat. Cooper entered the 5th district Democratic primary along with several other candidates, including Davidson County Sheriff Gayle Ray, Tennessee&#x27;s first female sheriff, and state legislator John Arriola. Cooper won the primary with 47% of the vote. He won the general election against Republican nominee Robert Duvall (not the actor Robert Duvall), 64%-33%.

The 5th, based in heavily Democratic Nashville, has long been one of the South&#x27;s most Democratic districts. It and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1875, and no Republican had made a serious bid for it since 1972. Upon his return to Congress, the Democrats gave him back his seniority.

====2010====

Cooper defeated Republican nominee David Hall, 57%–42%. This is his smallest margin of victory during his time representing the 5th district.

====2012====

Republicans gained complete control of state government for the first time since Reconstruction. This led to speculation that the legislature might try to draw the 5th out from under Cooper in an effort to gain another Republican district. In the summer of 2011, Cooper and Nashville Mayor Karl Dean told &quot;The Tennessean&quot; that they had heard rumors that Nashville would be split among three Republican districts. Despite its size, Nashville has been entirely or mostly in a single district since Reconstruction. Cooper said he had seen a map that would have put his Nashville home in the heavily Republican 6th district. The 5th would have been reconfigured into a strongly Republican district stretching from Murfreesboro to the Alabama border, while the rest of Nashville would have been placed in the heavily Republican 7th district. Had it been implemented, the map would have left Cooper with only two realistic places to run—an incumbent-versus-incumbent challenge in the 6th against freshman Republican Diane Black, or the reconfigured 5th, which had reportedly been drawn for State Senator and Murfreesboro resident Bill Ketron, chairman of the redistricting committee. But the final map was far less ambitious, and made the 5th slightly more Democratic than its predecessor. Notably, Cooper picked up all of Nashville; previously, a sliver of southwestern Nashville had been in the 7th.

Cooper defeated Republican nominee B. Staats, 65%–33%.

====2020====

Cooper was challenged in the Democratic primary by public defender Keeda Haynes, Justin Jones, and former Republican Joshua Rawlings, though Jones withdrew before the primary. Haynes was endorsed by state senator Brenda Gilmore and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, among others. Cooper defeated Haynes and Rawlings with 57% of the vote to Haynes&#x27;s 40% and Rawlings&#x27;s 3%.

In the general election, Cooper did not face a Republican nominee. He received 99.99% of the vote, with 14 votes going to write-in candidates.

=== The Golden Goose Award ===
In 2012, Cooper created the Golden Goose Award to recognize the human and economic benefits of federally funded research. Each year, the award is given to scientists to highlight examples of seemingly obscure studies that have led to major breakthroughs and resulted in significant societal impact. Cooper&#x27;s inspiration for the award came from his desire to reverse the legacy of former Senator William Proxmire&#x27;s &quot;Golden Fleece Award&quot;, which attacked federal spending he saw as wasteful, often federally funded scientific research. Cooper, known as &quot;Father Goose&quot;, was honored at the 2022 Golden Goose Award Ceremony.

=== Retirement ===

On January 25, 2022, Cooper announced he would not run for reelection and would retire from Congress. Cooper made the decision due to the state legislature&#x27;s controversial move to split Davidson County into three congressional districts in an attempt to gerrymander another Republican district.

The final map pushed the 5th into portions of heavily Republican counties to the east and south. Joe Biden easily won the old 5th with 60% of the vote, but Donald Trump would have carried the new 5th with 55%. At the same time, parts of Nashville were drawn into the heavily Republican 6th and 7th districts. Cooper&#x27;s only options would have been running in the new 5th, which would have been almost two-thirds new to him, or challenging Republican incumbents John Rose in the 6th or Mark Green in the 7th. Believing he had no realistic chance of staying in Congress, Cooper opted to retire.

===Tenure===

Cooper was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition, and he had a generally moderate voting record. He also served on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Despite the different policy affiliation, he became one of Barack Obama&#x27;s earliest Congressional endorsers. Cooper opposed an $819 billion economic stimulus plan that passed the House in 2009, but ended up voting for the revised $787 billion final package. He is one of only a few Blue Dog members not to seek earmarks. Cooper voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010.

In 2006, Cooper persuaded Nelson Current publishers to issue &quot;The Financial Report of the United States: The Official Report the White House Does Not Want You to Read&quot;, for which he wrote the introduction.

In 2009 the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote of Cooper&#x27;s concerns about the national deficit, &quot;It&#x27;s even worse than most people think, he says, because of dodgy accounting used by the federal government. ... &#x27;The U.S. government uses cash accounting,&#x27; he says. &#x27;That is illegal for any enterprise of any size in America except for the U.S. government.&#x27;&quot; He made similar remarks on PBS, saying, &quot;The real deficit in America is at least twice as large as any politician will tell you. And it may be ten times larger.&quot;

In 2011, Cooper was one of five Democrats to vote for the Cut, Cap, and Balance Act, and co-sponsored the Stop Online Piracy Act.

In 2012, Cooper authored the No Budget, No Pay Act, which specified that members of Congress would not be paid unless they passed a budget by October 1, 2012. It became law in modified form in 2015. Also in 2012, Cooper and Representative Steve LaTourette forced the only congressional vote on the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction package.

Cooper created the Golden Goose Award to honor the benefits of government-funded scientific research with an annual award ceremony at the Library of Congress. The award is intended to boost the morale of researchers who are often ridiculed by politicians for their work.

In January 2013, Cooper was the only Democrat in the House to vote against an emergency bill to provide additional disaster and recovery funds in the wake of Hurricane Sandy after supporting the initial $30 billion in relief.

In recent cycles, Cooper has consistently voted for someone other than Nancy Pelosi for speaker. He cast his vote for Heath Shuler in 2011, Colin Powell in 2013, January 2015 and October 2015, and for Tim Ryan in 2017. He voted present in 2019. In 2021, Cooper broke his streak and voted for Pelosi.

In 2017, Cooper worked with Republican Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama on a proposal to establish a Space Corps under the Department of the Air Force. This proposal passed in the House and then failed in the Senate. Two years later, a bill with very similar language was signed into law, creating the United States Space Force.

On December 18, 2019, Cooper voted for both articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump.

On January 13, 2021, Cooper voted for the second impeachment of Donald Trump.

In January 2022, when the board of trustees of McMinn County Schools in Tennessee, in a 10-0 decision, removed the Pulitzer Prize-winning Holocaust graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot; from its curriculum for 8th grade English classes, overriding a State curriculum decision, Cooper was critical of the decision. He called the ban &quot;outrageous&quot; and &quot;really shameful&quot;.

Cooper served on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and was one of the top Democrats in charge of both nuclear weapons and military satellites for many years. Although most of the work was classified, he wrote an article for &quot;War on the Rocks&quot; titled &quot;Updating Space Doctrine: How to Avoid World War III&quot;, which advocated for the weaponization of space as a deterrence. Cooper was one of few Democrats who supported the Space Development Agency, to build space-based deterrence. He and his Republican counterpart, Doug Lamborn, also wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s Correct a Misperception about Nuclear Modernization&quot; for &quot;Defense One&quot;.

;Criticism of Congress
In 2009, Cooper and his aide Russell Rumbaugh authored an article titled &quot;Real Acquisition Reform&quot;, which was printed in &quot;Joint Forces Quarterly&quot;.

Cooper spoke with Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig about reforming Congress. According to Lessig, Cooper said that members of Congress are so preoccupied with the question of what they will do after leaving Congress–the most obvious career path being lobbying–that they fall into the habit of thinking about how to serve special interests rather than how to serve the public. According to Lessig, Cooper called Congress a &quot;Farm League for K Street&quot;. &quot;The Boston Review&quot; reprinted Cooper&#x27;s Harvard lecture on &quot;Fixing Congress.&quot;

In 2011, Cooper said, &quot;Working in this Congress is deeply frustrating; in fact, it&#x27;s enraging. My colleagues are misbehaving. They&#x27;re posturing for voters back home. They&#x27;re taking the cheap political hit instead of studying the problem that&#x27;s before us.&quot; The same year, he &quot;called the partisan posturing over the debt ceiling &#x27;an extremely dangerous game of chicken,&#x27; and said he&#x27;d &#x27;never seen politicians act more irresponsibly than they have been recently,&#x27; over the nation&#x27;s debt.&quot;

Cooper was ranked the 20th most bipartisan member of the House during the 114th United States Congress (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Tennessee) in the Lugar Center and McCourt School of Public Policy&#x27;s Bipartisan Index, which ranks members of Congress by bipartisanship (by measuring how often each member&#x27;s bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member&#x27;s co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).

In 2022, Cooper was one of 16 Democrats to vote against the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.

<text>An American Ballroom Companion is an online collection of over two hundred social dance manuals at the Library of Congress related to the period of cca. 1490--1920. Along with social dance instruction manuals, this online presentation also includes a significant number of antidance manuals, histories, treatises on etiquette, information about theatrical dance. 

The collection presents dance materials from various locations of the Library: General Collections, the Music Division, and the Rare Book and Special Collections Division.

The collection also presents a number of videoclips to illustrate the materials. The clips were recorded on several Library of Congress events starting from the 100th anniversary of the Library&#x27;s Jefferson Building held in 1997.

<doc id="960993" wikidata="Q1887138" url="?curid=960993" title="Sikorsky S-42">
<text>The Sikorsky S-42 was a commercial flying boat designed and built by Sikorsky Aircraft to meet requirements for a long-range flying boat laid out by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) in 1931. The innovative design included wing flaps, variable-pitch propellers, and a tail-carrying full-length hull. The prototype first flew on 29 March 1934, and, in the period of development and test flying that followed, quickly established ten world records for payload-to-height. The &quot;Flying Clipper&quot; and the &quot;Pan Am Clipper&quot; were other names for the S-42.

==Design and development==

During the inaugural flight of Sikorsky&#x27;s previous flying boat, the S-40, on November 19, 1931, the pilot and Pan American Airways consultant, Charles Lindbergh, who considered the S-40 a monstrosity, engaged designer Igor Sikorsky in a conversation about what he thought the next airplane should look like. The conversation continued that night at the hotel in Jamaica. Sikorsky argued that design development should be incremental and that the safe approach would be a larger S-40. Lindbergh argued that a sleeker design, with a range in still air of , was needed.

In June 1931 Pan Am president Juan Trippe had requested designs from six aircraft companies for an aircraft able to span the oceans. The new design would need increased lifting capacity to carry enough fuel and of mail, but no passengers, for a nonstop flight against a headwind, at a higher cruising speed than the norm for similar flying boats at that time. Of the six companies tenders had been sent to, only Sikorsky and Martin provided submissions. Sikorsky offered the S-42. The other offer was the more ambitious Martin M-130.

The new Sikorsky design, the S-42, had major aerodynamic improvements over the S-40. Igor Sikorsky said, &quot;in its very outline the S-42 represents simplicity. Diverting sharply from the past Sikorsky designs, external bracings have been reduced to a minimum. The tail, instead of being supported by outriggers, is attached directly to the hull.&quot; The S-42 had a high wing loading which required flaps to provide acceptable takeoff and landing speeds. Though Lindbergh approved of the S-42, it fell far short of his proposed range. Stripped of all accommodations, with extra fuel tanks in the fuselage, the S-42 was just able to fly proving flights across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Pan Am would have to wait for the Martin M-130 to have an airliner capable of flying the Pacific with a payload.

Pan Am&#x27;s S-42s were used primarily on the Miami - Rio de Janeiro route. In 1937 S-42s also operated a New York-to-Bermuda service. 1940 saw S-42 flights between Seattle and Alaska. An S-42 was also used between Manila and Hong Kong.
British Marine Aircraft Ltd. was formed in February 1936 to produce S-42A flying boats under license in the United Kingdom but nothing came of this. The company built a factory on the western side of the Hamble peninsula with a slipway to Southampton Water. When the deal fell through, the company was sold to Henry Folland, who renamed it Folland Aircraft Limited.

==Operational history==

Flying for Pan American Airways, a total of ten S-42s were built, manufactured by the Vought-Sikorsky Aircraft Division of the United Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut. The prototype first flew on March 30, 1934.

Pan American was the sole customer for the S-42. The S-42 &quot;Pan Am Clipper&quot; surveyed the route from the US West Coast to China, making the first survey flight from Alameda, California to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in April 1935. 

According to Sikorsky, &quot;Later on, another Pan American S-42 inaugurated the longest over ocean airline in the world from San Francisco to New Zealand. Finally in July, 1937, another S-42 Clipper made the first regular airline crossing of the North Atlantic Ocean starting from the United States, flying first to England by the northern route, and then to Portugal by the Bermuda-Azores route.

In March 1939 a Pan Am S-42 was scheduled to leave Miami at 0730, stop overnight in San Juan, Port of Spain, Belem and Recife, and arrive at Rio de Janeiro at 1530 on the fifth day. (It returned to Miami, and passengers to Buenos Aires continued on DC2/DC3s.)

In early 1942 the U.S. Navy acquired one S-42 which it used as a transport in the Caribbean and to South America.

All Sikorsky S-42s were either scrapped or destroyed in crashes.

In 1947, inventor Lemuel Stewart purchased the fuselage of S-42 NC-822M &quot;Brazilian Clipper&quot; from Pan Am for $750.00, converted it to a six-room houseboat, and kept it docked in a boat canal in Miami, Florida. Its ultimate fate is unknown.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
On April 11, 1936, a Pan Am S-42 crashed on takeoff from Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, killing three of 25 on board. The pilot swerved to avoid a fishing boat that was in his path but one pontoon struck the boat and the aircraft overturned.

On January 11, 1938, Pan Am Flight 1, an S-42B named &quot;Samoan Clipper&quot; (formerly &quot;Pan American Clipper II&quot;), exploded near Pago Pago, American Samoa. The flying boat developed an engine problem shortly after takeoff. The pilot elected to dump fuel before making an emergency landing, but the aircraft exploded while fuel dumping was in progress. All seven crew members (including famous aviator Captain Ed Musick), died in the crash.

On October 3, 1941, Pam Am Flight 203, an S-42A named &quot;Dominican Clipper&quot;, crashed on landing in the harbour at San Juan, Puerto Rico, killing two of 27 on board. After the approach to San Juan, the aircraft hit the water in a nose-low attitude while moving sideways; after the first contact the aircraft swerved violently to the right and broke apart.

On December 8, 1941, a Pan Am S-42B named &quot;Hong Kong Clipper II&quot; (formerly &quot;Bermuda Clipper&quot; and &quot;Alaska Clipper&quot;) was destroyed on the water at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong, during a Japanese bombing raid.

On July 27, 1943, while docked at Manaus in Brazil a Pan Am S-42B named &quot;Bermuda Clipper&quot; (formerly &quot;Pan American Clipper III&quot;) developed an engine fire in response to which a flight engineer pulled the gas dump valve control instead of the fire extinguisher control. The expulsion of fuel spread the fire and the resulting inferno destroyed the aircraft. No one was killed or injured.

On August 8, 1944, Pan Am Flight 218, an S-42 named &quot;Hong Kong Clipper&quot; (formerly &quot;West Indies Clipper&quot; and &quot;Pan Am Clipper I&quot;) on a return trip from San Juan to Miami with intermediate stops at Port-au-Prince and Antilla, Cuba, crashed shortly after taking off from Antilla. After striking, bow first, the flying boat left the water in a slightly nose-high attitude, then returned, and by the third time, stalled. There were 17 fatalities (all passengers) out of the 26 passengers and five crew.

<text>Johnny Brown (June 11, 1937 – March 2, 2022) was an American actor, comedian and singer. He was most famous for his role as building superintendent Nathan Bookman on the 1970s CBS sitcom, &quot;Good Times&quot;. Brown portrayed Bookman until the series was cancelled in 1979.

==Life and career==
A nightclub promoter and performer, his early best role was as a regular cast member of the television series &quot;Laugh-in&quot;. Brown is mostly remembered for his portly physique, beautiful smile, mobile facial expressions, and easy, pleasant joking style.

Brown made appearances on &quot;The Leslie Uggams Show&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, Punky Brewster, &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot;, &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;, &quot;The Jamie Foxx Show&quot;, &quot;The Wayans Bros&quot;, and &quot;Martin&quot;. He had a recurring role as building super Nathan Bookman in the 1970&#x27;s TV series &quot;Good Times&quot;. He had a small role in the 1970 film &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; starring Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis as a waiter on a railroad dining car. Brown went to school with Walter Dean Myers when he lived in Harlem, New York City as a boy.

Brown also appeared in several television commercials, including ads for Hunt&#x27;s Manwich and the Write Brothers pen, a short-lived product of the Papermate pen company in the 1970s. The commercial consisted of an elaborate musical number, &quot;Write On, Brothers, Write On&quot;, led by Brown as a schoolteacher who encourages his chorus line of students to use this pen for their school assignments.
Brown also appeared in a TWA commercial as skycap “Bud Jones”.

In 1997, Brown contributed his voice to the introduction of the compilation album &quot;Comedy Stew: The Best of Redd Foxx&quot;. In the introduction, Brown tells of how Norman Lear had considered Brown to play the role of Lamont in &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, but was unavailable to do so because of his prior commitment to &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, leading Lear to give the role to Demond Wilson instead. He also had a one-off role as &quot;Fat-Man&quot; in the original The Ghost Busters television show.

In 1998, he appeared in Season 4 of Touched by an Angel as a dying comedian in Cry and you Cry Alone. 

In 1999, Brown appeared on two episodes of the Nickelodeon children&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot;.

He played Wallace &quot;Suitcase&quot; Jefferson in the 2004 mockumentary &quot;The Old Negro Space Program&quot;.

==Death==
Brown died in Los Angeles on March 2, 2022, at the age of 84. He collapsed shortly after leaving a doctor&#x27;s appointment for his pacemaker and was pronounced dead after arriving at a hospital.

==Records==

Having toured with Sam &quot;The Man&quot; Taylor since 1958, Johnny Brown began his own recording career. His first release was on Columbia Records, &quot;Walkin&#x27;, Talkin&#x27;, Kissin&#x27; Doll&quot; b/w &quot;Sundown&quot; in February 1961. He was only 23 at the time. The promotional release was accompanied with a special insert describing his background (see picture). His next record was released in early 1968 on Atlantic Records, &quot;You&#x27;re Too Much in Love With Yourself&quot; b/w &quot;Don&#x27;t Dilly Dally, Dolly&quot;, the latter showing off his skilled impression of Louis Armstrong. That release had initially been available on Crest Records.

<doc id="961011" wikidata="Q1638685" url="?curid=961011" title="Hurricane Roxanne">
<text>Hurricane Roxanne was a rare and erratic tropical cyclone that caused extensive flooding in Mexico due to its unusual movement. The seventeenth storm, tenth hurricane, and the fifth and final major hurricane of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Roxanne developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea from an area of low pressure on October 7. The depression curved northward, causing it to avoid landfall in Central America. By October 9, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Roxanne. On the following day, Roxanne turned west-northward, where it promptly intensified into a hurricane. As Roxanne headed generally westward, it began to rapidly deepen and reached Category 3 intensity less than 24 hours after becoming a hurricane. Shortly thereafter, Roxanne made landfall near Cozumel, Mexico at its peak intensity, which caused severe damage.

Roxanne rapidly weakened while traversing the Yucatan Peninsula, and when it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12, the storm was a Category 1 hurricane. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical storm later that day. Roxanne tracked northwestward and eventually re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. Thereafter, Roxanne began to meander erratically in the Gulf of Mexico; the storm turned abruptly southeastward and remained nearly stationary offshore of the Yucatan Peninsula. The following day, Roxanne curved back northwestward and weakened back to a tropical storm on October 17. Roxanne completed a cyclonic loop across the Gulf of Mexico on October 18. Further weakening occurred, and Roxanne was downgraded to a tropical depression on October 19. A cold front in the Gulf of Mexico turned Roxanne abruptly southward, and the storm dissipated just offshore of Veracruz on October 21.

Roxanne was the first October hurricane that formed and reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) in the western Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Hattie in October 1961. Due to its slow and erratic movement, Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall in many areas of southern Mexico, and some areas reported over of precipitation. Heavy rainfall, in turn, led to extensive flooding, which destroyed crop, washed out roads, and damaged at least 40,000 homes. In addition, significant coastal flooding also occurred, as storm surge for nearly a week caused water to travel inland for hundreds of yards. High winds also occurred over the Yucatan Peninsula, with one station reporting hurricane-force winds on October 11. Overall, it is estimated that Roxanne caused $1.5 billion (1995 USD) in damage, although not all damage could be distinguished from Hurricane Opal. In addition, 29 fatalities were reported.

== Meteorological history ==

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 26. It moved westward, producing an area of convection, or thunderstorms, over the central Caribbean Sea by October 4. By two days later, the system had a broad circulation located between the coast of Honduras and the Cayman Islands. An upper-level trough, left behind after Hurricane Opal exited the region, interacted with the tropical wave and the circulation, which gradually became better organized; the origins were complex, but common for disturbances over the western Caribbean. By October 7, banding features developed within the convection. Late that day, the system organized enough for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to designate it Tropical Depression Nineteen, located off the northeast tip of Nicaragua. A day later, the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the development of the circulation. While in its formative stages, the depression moved northward, steered by a nearby upper-level low, amid weak steering currents caused by a subtropical ridge over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Early on October 9, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Roxanne. Roxanne was the first ever “R” named storm in the Atlantic basin.

Roxanne was initially affected by winds from the north, which dislocated the circulation from the convection. As the nearby upper-level low moved into Central America, Roxanne was able to intensify, developing outflow all around the storm. Initially, the storm threatened western Cuba and the Cayman Islands, steered by a weak trough over Florida, which moved eastward and was replaced by a ridge in the area. This turned Roxanne westward toward the Yucatán Peninsula. At the same time it was turning, Roxanne developed a well-defined eye in the center of its convection. At 06:00 UTC on October 10, the storm intensified to hurricane status. Roxanne intensified further, based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters. Early on October 11, the NHC estimated peak winds of ; this made Roxanne the first hurricane since Hurricane Hattie in 1961 to develop in the western Caribbean and intensify to a major hurricane. Shortly after Roxanne reached peak intensity, the hurricane made landfall just north of Tulum, a small town near Cozumel, Mexico.
Moving westward across the Yucatán Peninsula, Roxanne weakened but maintained hurricane status as it emerged into the Bay of Campeche on October 12. Although the storm remained well-organized, it lost most of its deep convection and intensity. The storm drifted in the body of water, steered by a ridge to the north. On October 12, Roxanne weakened to tropical storm status. The storm continued northwestward and turned more to the north, steered by a cold front. Roxanne redeveloped an eye feature, and it re-intensified into a hurricane on October 14. The hurricane turned to the southeast, after the cold front bypassed the system and the ridge rebuilt. Over the next day, Roxanne stalled off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. Drier air, wind shear, and upwelling caused the hurricane to weaken back to a tropical storm. By late on October 17, the circulation had little convection associated with it. The storm moved northwestward for a few days, until an approaching cold front steered Roxanne to the south on October 19; by that time, Roxanne had weakened to tropical depression status. On October 21, the circulation of Roxanne was dissipating as it moved onshore Veracruz.

==Preparations==
Early in Roxanne&#x27;s existence, its northward movement presented a threat to the western Caribbean. As a result, the government of the Cayman Islands declared a tropical storm warning for all of the islands on October 9; On the same day, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for Pinar del Río and the Isle of Youth. The advisories were canceled after the storm turned away from the area.

Parts of Mexico were under tropical cyclone warnings and watches for ten days. On October 9, the government of Mexico raised hurricane watches for coastal areas between Chetumal, Quintana Roo and Cabo Catoche. Early on October 10, a hurricane warning was declared for areas west of Cabo Catoche to Progreso, Yucatán. By the afternoon, the hurricane watch was extended past Progreso to Ciudad del Carmen, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day. A new tropical storm warning was issued by the government of Belize that evening for areas north of Belize City; however, this warning was discontinued early on October 11 as the center of Roxanne was not expected to pass near the area. With Roxanne maintaining its intensity over the Yucatán, the Mexican government issued a hurricane warning from Coatzacoalcos to Tuxpan, as the storm was initially projected to go more westward. When Roxanne was looping off the northwest Yucatán peninsula, a hurricane warning was issued from Progreso to Tampico. The last warnings were downgraded on October 19, when Roxanne weakened to a tropical depression.

In the Yucatán Peninsula, thousands of residents and tourists were urged to evacuate from coastal areas. In the city of Cancún, roughly 12,000 tourists and 3,900 residents relocated to safer areas; however, some refused to leave and decided to wait out the storm in hotels. On Cozumel, most hotel guests decided to ride out the storm instead of evacuate. There, most homeowners and businesses stored all loose items indoors and boarded up windows. An emergency alert was issued to hundreds of fishermen off the Yucatán coastline to move to port immediately. In the state of Campeche, 150 shelters were opened and able to accommodate roughly 15,000 people. However, more than 20,000 people sought refuge from the storm throughout the state.

==Impact==

Roxanne affected the Yucatán Peninsula less than two weeks after Hurricane Opal formed in the area. The combined damage between the two hurricanes was estimated at US$1.5 billion. At least two locations in Mexico reported sustained hurricane-force winds from Roxanne – Mérida, Yucatán and Paraíso, Tabasco. At the former location, an automatic weather station recorded a wind gust of on October 11. Roxanne dropped heavy rainfall along its path. Near Champotón, Campeche, a pluviometer recorded of precipitation, the highest total in the country related to Roxanne. Locations in Veracruz and Tabasco also recorded over of rainfall. While Roxanne was moving ashore eastern Mexico, it produced an estimated storm surge of . Waves washed into hotel lobbies in Cancún and Cozumel. In the Gulf of Mexico, waves struck the Mexican coast while Roxanne drifted offshore for a few days, pushing water hundreds of yards inland. Waves eroded the eastern portion of Ciudad del Carmen, while the western portion of the island gained sand.

Roxanne caused 29 deaths, with six of them coming from the sinking of the pipelay derrick barge &quot;DLB 269&quot; with 245 people on board. Roxanne caused widespread flooding and agriculture damage in eastern Mexico, notably in Campeche, Tabasco, Veracruz. Along the coast, high waves wrecked docks, fishing stalls, and nets while damaging dozens of boats. Across eastern Mexico, Roxanne damaged more than 40,000 homes. Crops were destroyed, cattle drowned, and roads were either washed out or blocked by mudslides. The road between the City of Carmen and Campeche was completely destroyed. Rainfall and storm surge combined with overflowing rivers caused the worst flooding in Campeche since 1927. Floodwaters damaged the aqueduct for Ciudad del Carmen. Throughout the state of Tabasco, nearly half of the highways sustained significant damage. Governor Roberto Madrazo Pintado estimated that it would cost roughly $60 million to repair them.

Roxanne caused the state owned Pemex to shut down 90% of its drilling in the Gulf of Mexico during its pass as well as halt all shipments from three oil terminals in the southeastern region of the gulf. As a result, Mexico lost millions of dollars. Oil production dropped from 2.838 million barrels a day in September to 1.976 million barrels a day in October or 30.4%. (A rough guess using a price of the Maya Crude averaging about $13.77/b, 30 days in September, and 862,000 barrels a day of lost output yields $356 million, which in 2011 dollars equals about $530 million.) Oil production didn&#x27;t completely recover in November, so there were some additional losses, but did completely return in December. The Mexican government allocated 16 million pesos to people affected by Roxanne, as well as 55 million pesos to fishermen.

==Retirement==

Due to the scale of the damage the hurricane caused in Mexico, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Roxanne&quot; in the spring of 1996, and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical storm. The name was replaced with &quot;Rebekah&quot; for the 2001 season.

<doc id="961012" wikidata="Q505480" url="?curid=961012" title="John Harvard (politician)">
<text>John Harvard (June 4, 1938 – January 9, 2016) was a Canadian journalist, politician, and officeholder in Manitoba. He served as a federal member of Parliament from 1988 to 2004, and was appointed the 23rd Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba just before Canada&#x27;s 2004 federal election.

==Career==
Harvard was a broadcast journalist from 1957 to 1988. He worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) for eighteen years and was for many years the host of a popular call-in show in Winnipeg called &quot;Talk Back&quot;, on CJOB-AM. Coincidentally, his predecessor as lieutenant-governor, Peter Liba, worked as a journalist for CBC&#x27;s competitor CanWest.

==Member of Parliament==
Harvard was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1988 election as a Liberal, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative George Minaker by 18,695 votes to 16,993 in the middle-class suburban riding of Winnipeg—St. James (in the previous election in 1984, the Liberal candidate had finished third). Harvard sat as a backbench member of the parliamentary opposition, led by John Turner and later Jean Chrétien, from 1988 to 1993.

The Liberal Party won the 1993 federal election, and Harvard was easily re-elected in Winnipeg—St. James, defeating his nearest competitor, Reformer Peter Blumenschein, by about 13,000 votes. He was not appointed to Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet, but was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services in 1996.

Harvard was again re-elected without difficulty in the federal election of 1997, running in the redistributed riding of Charleswood—Assiniboia. He was named parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food after the election, serving until 1998.

Harvard faced his most difficult bid for re-election in the 2000 campaign, narrowly defeating Canadian Alliance challenger Cyril McFate by 13,901 votes to 11,569. Progressive Conservative Curtis Moore finished third with 9,991 votes, causing many to regard the riding as winnable for a &quot;united right&quot; in the next election.

Harvard supported Paul Martin for the Liberal Party leadership over a period of several years, and it was perhaps for this reason that Jean Chrétien never appointed him to the Cabinet of Canada. As early as 2000, Harvard publicly suggested that Chrétien should consider resigning as party leader. When Martin became prime minister on December 12, 2003, Harvard was sworn into the Privy Council as parliamentary secretary to the minister of international trade.

==Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba==
Harvard resigned his parliamentary seat on May 6, 2004. It is rumoured that this was done at the urging of Winnipeg mayor Glen Murray, who was seeking the Liberal candidacy for a Winnipeg-area riding in the upcoming federal election. It was announced the next day that Harvard would be appointed lieutenant-governor of Manitoba, and he was sworn in on June 30. Murray was unable to retain the seat for the Liberals.

The position of lieutenant-governor is largely ceremonial, and Harvard held very little direct influence over the government of Manitoba. While serving as the LG, as is the tradition, he and his then-spouse, Her Honour, Lenore Berscheid, resided in Government House (Manitoba) in Winnipeg. She held two Masters degrees and had a career in Education &amp; Family Therapy before her passing in 2018.

His fourth child, Sasha Harvard (1979–2013) was completing his Law degree, and lived in Government House with his parents and their cats.

==Later life and death==
In October 2005, Harvard was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba. In August 2009, after his term ended, he was succeeded by Lieutenant-Governor by Philip S. Lee. Harvard died of cancer aged 77 on January 9, 2016.

<doc id="961022" wikidata="Q3567041" url="?curid=961022" title="Edgar J. Goodspeed">
<text>Edgar Johnson Goodspeed (October 23, 1871 – January 13, 1962) was an American theologian and scholar of Greek and the New Testament, and Ernest DeWitt Burton Distinguished Service Professor of the University of Chicago until his retirement. He taught for many years at the University of Chicago, whose collection of New Testament manuscripts he enriched by his searches. The University&#x27;s collection is now named in his honor.

== Biography ==
Edgar J. Goodspeed was born in Quincy, Illinois. He was the son of Thomas Wakefield Goodspeed. At the age of ten, Goodspeed had been tutored in Latin by his father&#x27;s students at Baptist Union Theological Seminary in Morgan Park, Illinois. Edgar J. Goodspeed received pre-college classes at the Old University of Chicago, and finished in 1886.

His wife&#x27;s name was Elfleda Bond, and his father-in-law was Joseph Bond.

He died in 1962 and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

=== Education ===
He earned a B.A. from Denison University in Granville, Ohio 1890, and he then studied Semitics at Yale for one year under William Rainey Harper. A little later, Harper was appointed as the first president of the University of Chicago, and Goodspeed moved to Chicago and continued his graduate studies at this new institution, where Goodspeed&#x27;s father was one of the founders and secretary of the Board of Trustees. He was a post-graduate fellow at the University of Chicago from 1892, and he received his Doctor of Biblical Studies degree in 1897.

Goodspeed received his Ph.D. in 1898 at The University of Chicago. He spent the following two years abroad, traveling and studying in Germany, England, the Netherlands, Egypt, Palestine, and Greece.

In 1928, Goodspeed received a doctorate in Divinity from the Denison University (Doctor honoris causa).

=== Academic work ===

While pursuing graduate work, Goodspeed taught classics at two Chicago-area schools, the Morgan Park Academy and South Side Academy. He taught In classical languages at the Morgan Park Academy in 1891 and 1892 and at the South Side Academy from 1894 to 1898. He taught Biblical and Patristic Greek at the University of Chicago starting in 1898.

Upon his return to Chicago in 1900, he again joined the University faculty and rose steadily to become Professor of Biblical and Patristic Greek in 1915. In 1919 he served as president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis. When his New Testament colleague Ernest DeWitt Burton was appointed president of the University of Chicago in 1923, Goodspeed succeeded him as Chairman of the Department of New Testament and Early Christian Literature. From 1929 to 1937 Goodspeed was chairman of the department of New Testament studies at the University of Chicago. In 1937, Goodspeed became an emeritus member of the faculty and retired with his wife, Elfleda Bond Goodspeed, to a home in Bel-Air, California.

== Awards ==
*Doctor honoris causa (D.D.), Denison University, 1928

== Works ==
According to the University of Chicago Library during the Goodspeed lifetime &quot;he wrote 64 books, collaborated on 16 others, and published 189 major articles and countless reviews&quot;.

=== Bible translations ===

He is widely remembered for his translations of the Bible: &quot;The New Testament: an American Translation&quot; (1923), and (with John Merlin Powis Smith) &quot;The Bible, An American Translation&quot; (1935), the &quot;Goodspeed Bible&quot;. He is also remembered for his translation of the Apocrypha, and that translation was included in &quot;The Complete Bible, An American Translation&quot; (1939). Finally, Harper &amp; Brothers issued his widely heralded &quot;The Apostolic Fathers: An American Translation&quot; (1950).

Aside from his scholarly work, he wrote many non-dogmatic introductions to biblical literature for the lay reader:

<doc id="961037" wikidata="Q1322331" url="?curid=961037" title="Bill Jenkins (politician)">
<text>William Lewis Jenkins (born November 29, 1936) is an American politician from the state of Tennessee. He represented the state&#x27;s 1st Congressional district, centered on the Tri-Cities (map), from 1997 until his successor was sworn in on January 3, 2007.

==Background and education==
Jenkins was born in Detroit, Michigan, to parents from Rogersville, Tennessee. He is a seventh-generation Tennessean. He served in the United States Army from 1959 to 1960, and graduated from Tennessee Tech and the University of Tennessee College of Law.

==Political career==
Jenkins was elected to the Tennessee General Assembly as a Republican in 1962 and he served as Speaker of the House from 1969 to 1971—the first Republican to hold that position since a few years after Reconstruction, and the last one until Kent Williams in 2009. He unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Tennessee in 1970, was a Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Conservation, serving in the Cabinet of Winfield Dunn, and according to his website biography, he was a senior policy advisor on energy and legislative issues for Governor Lamar Alexander.

Jenkins was the only Republican to serve as Speaker of the Tennessee House in the 20th century. He was also one of the youngest persons to ever hold the office.

Jenkins served on the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority from 1971 to 1978, and he was a circuit court judge for Tennessee&#x27;s Third Judicial District from 1990 to 1996.

==Running for Congress==

On May 10, 1996, he resigned his judgeship to run for the House of Representatives from the First Congressional District after 17-term incumbent Jimmy Quillen announced his retirement.

The 12-way primary election was watched very closely in Tennessee Republican circles, as the district is so heavily Republican that whoever won the primary was all but assured of being the district&#x27;s next congressman. The First District has been in Republican hands for all but four years since 1859.

Although Jenkins did not secure Quillen&#x27;s endorsement for the primary, he narrowly won with 18% of the vote and breezed to election in November.

==Reelection and legislation==
He was reelected four times without serious opposition, and ran unopposed in 2000 and 2002. He won a fifth term in 2004 with 74% of the vote.

Jenkins kept a relatively low profile in Congress in contrast to Quillen and B. Carroll Reece, who between them represented the 1st District for all but seven of the 76 years before Jenkins won the seat. His voting record was reliably conservative.

==Best bass fisherman in Congress==
As seen on ESPN: &quot;After the final cast was made, however, bragging rights for the title of &quot;best bass fishermen in Congress&quot; went to U.S. Representative Bill Jenkins (R-TN), who teamed up with BASS Elite Series pro Dave Wolak and Toyota&#x27;s Charlie Ing to finish with five bass weighing 18 pounds, 9 ounces.

Fittingly, the 70-year-old legislator from Tennessee also posted the largest fish of the event, a 4 ½-pound largemouth that he caught in Mattawoman Creek, a tributary of the Potomac River in Maryland.&quot;

==Retirement==
On February 15, 2006, Jenkins announced that he would not run for a sixth term. He said that he wanted to spend more time with his family since he turned 70 that November.

<text>Cuneo (; ; ; ) is a city and in Piedmont, Italy, the capital of the province of Cuneo, the fourth largest of Italy’s provinces by area.

It is located at 550 metres (1,804 ft) in the south-west of Piedmont, at the confluence of the rivers Stura and Gesso.

Cuneo is bounded by the municipalities of Beinette, Borgo San Dalmazzo, Boves, Busca, Caraglio, Castelletto Stura, Centallo, Cervasca, Morozzo, Peveragno, Tarantasca and Vignolo.

It is located near six mountain passes:
*Colle della Maddalena at 
*Colle di Tenda at – Tunnel of Tenda at , long
*Colle del Melogno at 
*Colle San Bernardo at 
*Colle di Nava at 
*Colle di Cadibona at .

==History==
Cuneo was founded in 1198 by the local population, who declared it an independent commune, freeing themselves from the authority of the bishops of Asti and the marquisses of Montferrat and Saluzzo. In 1210, the latter occupied it, and in 1231 the &quot;Cuneesi&quot; rebelled. In 1238, they were recognized as a free commune by Emperor Frederick II.

In 1259, the independence of Cuneo ceased forever, as it gave itself, also to take protection against its more powerful neighbours, to Charles I of Anjou, who was then the Count of Provence. Together with Alba, it was the main Angevine possession in Northern Italy; Angevine rule interrupted by periods under the control of Saluzzo, Savoy, and the Visconti of Milan was ended in 1382 when Cuneo was acquired by the Duchy of Savoy.

Cuneo became an important stronghold of the expanding Savoy state. The city was thus besieged several times by France: first in 1515 by Swiss troops of Francis I of France, then again in 1542, 1557, 1639, 1641, 1691 and, during the War of the Austrian Succession, in 1741. Cuneo resisted each siege successfully. The city was taken by France only during the Napoleonic Wars and was made the capital of the Stura department. After the restoration of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the unification of Italy, Cuneo became the capital of its namesake province in 1859. In 1862, Cuneo was the location of a Polish Military School moved from Genoa, which trained Polish officers in exile, the overwhelming majority of whom then fought in the Polish January Uprising in the Russian Partition of Poland in 1863–1864 (see also &quot;Italy–Poland relations&quot;).

During World War II, from 1943 to 1945, it was one of the main centres of partisan resistance against the German occupation of Italy.
In 1943, Cuneo&#x27;s Jewish citizens were briefly arrested and imprisoned at the nearby Borgo San Dalmazzo concentration camp by the order of Minister of the Interior Guido Buffarini Guidi. They were freed before the Minister&#x27;s orders came into effect and most community members fled Cuneo into hiding. 

However, on 9 December 1944, the Cuneo Police Department reopened the camp and imprisoned the remaining Jewish residents of Cuneo most of whom were then deported to Auschwitz. Few survived according to reports. Italian partisans liberated Cuneo from the German and Italian fascist occupation on 25 April 1945. The retreating fascist forces murdered the remaining six Jewish prisoners being held at Cuneo&#x27;s local prison.

<text>Dublin Port () is the seaport of Dublin, Ireland, of both historical and contemporary economic importance. Approximately two-thirds of Ireland&#x27;s port traffic travels via the port, which is by far the busiest on the island of Ireland.

==Location==
The modern Dublin Port is located on either side of the River Liffey, out to its mouth. On the north side of the river, the main part () of the port lies at the end of East Wall and North Wall, from Alexandra Quay. The element of the port on the south side of the river is much smaller () and lies at the beginning of the Poolbeg peninsula.

===Access===
The port is served by road, with a direct connection from the Dublin Port Tunnel to the northern part (and so a connection with the M50 motorway).

There is no passenger rail service to either part of Dublin Port but the northern part is served by freight rail. The northern part is also served by Nolan Coaches Route 853 Dublin City to Dublin Port and Dublin Bus, with route 53 and by a Luas terminus just outside the port area. The southern part can be reached by bus.

==Dublin Port Company==

The port is operated by the semi-state Dublin Port Company (DPC), incorporated on 28 February 1997 (formerly the Dublin Port and Docks Board, and successor to the Ballast Board founded in 1707), the headquarters of which are located just beyond the main port entrance on the northern side of the Liffey. In 2017 the area around the headquarters was rebuilt with the installation of a heritage crane and the creation of a maritime-themed garden. The company is responsible for the infrastructure of the port, with individual operations run by tenants such as State authorities, notably the customs service, ferry, freight and oil companies, terminal operators, and stevedores.

The port company is responsible for pilotage services within Dublin Bay, and manages the three port lighthouses (but not those of Howth or Kish Bank). It also formerly operated two drydocks, which were closed in 2016.

According to DPC, the port handled 23.5 million tonnes of cargo in 2003, as well as 1,426,000 passengers. That year 7,917 ships docked in the port, including 54 cruise liners carrying 54,000 visitors. In April 2010, the company announced its &quot;busiest week ever&quot;, following restrictions placed on European airspace because of the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland. Some 72,118 passengers were reported to have travelled through the ferry terminals during the week of 15–21 April that year, and that week saw the culmination of increased trade in Dublin Port, as the company&#x27;s figures for the first quarter of 2010 would eventually reveal. March 2010 saw a 13.5% trade increase when compared with March 2009, and that month was declared by the company as the fourth consecutive month of trade increase since the economic downturn. The figures of imports and exports declined during the depression of 2010 but then increased during the decade and in 2019, 38.1 million tonnes of cargo was handled and there were 7,898 ship movements of which 158 were cruise ships.

The medieval port of Dublin was located on the south bank of the Liffey near Christ Church Cathedral, a few kilometres upstream from its current location.

===Ballast Office===
On 17 September 1707, Thomas Burgh, the Surveyor General of Ireland, read a paper to the Dublin Society entitled &#x27;Some Thoughts for the Improveing the Harbour of Dublin&#x27; (&quot;sic&quot;) in which the dangers of the bar of Dublin (a shallow sandbank which ran across the mouth of the river) was mentioned as well as a proposed basin in which ships could be secure from inclement weather or hostile attack.

The year 1707 also witnessed the passing of &quot;An Act for Cleansing the Port, Harbour, and River of Dublin and for Erecting a Ballast Office in the said city&quot; which witnessed the initiation of the Ballast Office – the first municipal authority in Dublin to take control of the port. The key functions of the Ballast Office were the imposition of port charges and the maintenance of the navigation channel, the latter of which had been a perennial problem. Luke Gardiner acted as the first secretary of the office.

===Great South Wall===
In 1715, work began on constructing the Great South Wall to shelter the entrance to the port. Poolbeg Lighthouse at the end of the South Bull Wall was constructed in 1767. The wall was finally completed in 1795 measuring 5 km. This protected the port from the shifting sands of Dublin Bay.

After James Gandon&#x27;s Custom House was built further downstream in 1791, the port moved further towards the north bank of the river estuary.

===Bull Wall===
In 1800, a three-month survey of Dublin Bay conducted by Captain William Bligh recommended the construction of the Bull Wall. After the completion of the wall in 1825, North Bull Island slowly formed as sand built up behind it.

===Containerisation===

The advent of containerisation in the second half of the 20th century resulted in the port gradually moving a mile further downstream to enable new wharves with deeper water to be constructed.

==Future==
A Masterplan 2040 was published by the Dublin Port Company in 2012 setting out a plan to improve capacity at the Port and a commitment not to expand the Port into Dublin Bay. Prior to the Masterplan, over 40 years, the Dublin Port authorities had been exploring a controversial proposal to in-fill 21 hectares (52 acres) of Dublin Bay. The proposed development of Dublin Port which would have increased its capacity by 50 per cent was rejected by Bord Pleanála in June 2010.

==Services==
The main activity of the port is freight handling, with a wide range of vessels, from large container carriers to small diesel lighters, visiting daily.

Roll-on/roll-off passenger ferry services run regularly across the Irish Sea to Holyhead in Wales and in the summer months and at Christmas to Douglas, Isle of Man. Services also go to Cherbourg, France. The largest car ferry in the world, the Irish Ferries ship &quot;MV Ulysses (2000)&quot; which can carry up to 2000 passengers, runs on the Holyhead route. A new ship &quot;MV W.B. Yeats&quot; entered service in 2018 and is on the Cherbourg route. Another company, CLDN, has ships that travel 6 times a week to Rotterdam and Zeebrugge and use the latest super ferries in Europe: &quot;MV Celine&quot; and &quot;MV Delphine&quot;. These are the world&#x27;s largest short-sea Ro-Ro vessels with 8 km of road space on board. They do not take trucks on board, just the trailers.

Dublin Port is also increasingly a docking point for cruise liners. &quot;Celebrity Eclipse&quot; began to home port in Dublin on 29 April 2018, and the port authorities reported 158 cruise ship visits in 2019. A temporary facility, Terminal 7, was created between Promenade and Tolka Quay Road at Branch Road; entered from Promenade Road, this allows cruise guests to check-in and leave baggage. A shuttle service transports guests to Ocean Pier 33. A new baggage claim facility was added to Ocean Pier 33 for guests to use when disembarking.

==Aids to navigation and pilotage==
The port has three lighthouses in the mouth of the Liffey, multiple other aids to navigation and operates a pilot service.

==Terminals and operators==
There are eleven passenger, freight and border inspection terminals at Dublin Port, serving several operators.

==Other activities==
Within the main port enclave, on the north side of the river, are a power generating station (gas-fired), several oil terminals and a number of slightly-related businesses, and a Circle K petrol station on Bond Road. Entered at the north side of the port, but lying in East Wall, is one end of the Dublin Port Tunnel.

Since 2015 DPC has been involved in a series of heritage and community projects, including the Diving Bell Museum, the Tolka Greenway, the Maritime Garden, and the Pumphouse Heritage Zone. In 2020, the Liffey to Tolka Greenway, designed with Grafton Architects, was announced with support from the port company.

==Incidents==
A number of workers have died whilst working at Dublin Port, including James Byrne (June 2018), Dennis Gomez (November 2018) and Matthew Grimes (May 2021).

<text>A large goods vehicle (LGV), or heavy goods vehicle (HGV), in the European Union (EU) is any lorry with a gross combination mass (GCM) of over . Sub-category N2 is used for vehicles between 3,500 kg and and N3 for all goods vehicles over 12,000 kg as defined in Directive 2001/116/EC. The term medium goods vehicle is used within parts of the UK government to refer to goods vehicles of between 3,500 and 7,500 kg which according to the EU are also &quot;large goods vehicles.&quot;

Commercial carrier vehicles of up to 3,500 kg are referred to as light commercial vehicles and come into category N1. Parts of the UK government also refer to these smaller vehicles as &quot;large goods vehicles&quot; (also abbreviated &quot;LGV&quot;).

To cross country borders in the EU, LGVs must not exceed 44 tonnes laden weight or longer than , but longer and heavier vehicles (LHVs) are used within some EU countries, where they are known as Gigaliner, EuroCombi, EcoLiner, innovative commercial vehicle, mega-truck, and under other names. They are typically long and weigh up to 70 tonnes, and the implications of allowing them to cross boundaries was considered in 2011.

==Driver licensing==

===European Union===
It is necessary to have an appropriate European driving license to drive a large goods vehicle in the European Union. There are four categories:
*Category C1 allows the holder to drive a large goods vehicle with a maximum authorized mass (gross vehicle weight) of up to with a trailer having a maximum authorized mass of up to . This license can be obtained at 18 years of age and is the replacement for the HGV Class 3 in the UK (the old HGV Class 3 being any two-axle goods vehicle over 7,500 kg).
*Category C1+E allows the holder to drive a large goods vehicle with a maximum authorized mass (gross vehicle weight) of up to 7,500 kg with a trailer over 750 kg maximum authorized mass, provided that the maximum authorized mass of the trailer does not exceed the unladen mass of the vehicle being driven, and provided that the combined maximum authorized mass of both the vehicle and trailer does not exceed .
*Category C allows the holder to drive any large goods vehicle with a trailer having a maximum authorized mass of up to 750 kg. This is effectively the new GV Class 2 in the UK, the old HGV Class 2 being any rigid goods vehicle with more than two axles. A driver can commence training for a Category C license from 18 years old.
*Category C+E: allows the holder to drive any large goods vehicle with a trailer having a maximum authorized mass of over 750 kg. This license could only be obtained after six months&#x27; experience with a Class 2 truck, but more recently the law has changed so that it is now possible to take the tests back-to-back (Category C first then C+E the following week). This is the new Class 1 licence.

Operator Licensing Operation of heavy goods vehicles for commercial reasons in European Union requires an operator&#x27;s license. This allows member states to regulate companies operating these vehicles enforcing number of safety requirements which includes driver&#x27;s hours regulations and vehicle safety standards.

===UK===
Drivers who passed a Category B (car) test before January 1, 1997 will have received Categories C1 and C1+E (Restriction Code 107: not more than ) through the Implied Rights issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) (more commonly known as Grandfather Rights).

All UK LGV license holders must undergo a strict medical examination and eye test on application at age 45 and every 5 years thereafter. On reaching 65 years of age, a medical examination must be performed on an annual basis.

===Canada===
In the Canadian province of Ontario, drivers holding a Full Class AZ license can drive any truck/tractor trailer combination,
a combination of motor vehicle and towed vehicles where the towed vehicles exceed a total gross weight of and has air brakes, or a vehicle pulling double trailers. Drivers holding a Class B (school bus), C (regular bus) or D (heavy truck) license can drive a truck with a gross weight or registered gross weight exceeding or any truck and trailer combination exceeding 11,000 kg gross weight or registered gross weight provided the towed vehicle is not over 4,600 kg.

===New Zealand===

There are four classes of heavy vehicle license: 2, 3, 4 and 5. Classes 1 and 6 are for light vehicles and motorcycles, respectively. The classes describe the characteristics of the vehicle, the weight limits, and the maximum number of axles.

Drivers must begin with a class 2 (medium rigid vehicle) learner license before progressing to a class 3 medium combination vehicle license or a class 4 heavy rigid vehicle license. A class 5 (heavy combination vehicle) license can only be earned after driving with a class 4 license for a specific timeframe (depending on age) or completing an accelerated course.

As New Zealand has a graduated driver licensing system, drivers must pass a theory test before being allowed to drive on the road. They can then drive with a supervisor for six months followed by a practical test, or they can complete an accelerated heavy vehicle course.

==Safety==
LGVs and their drivers are covered by strict regulations in many jurisdictions. For example, to improve safety, limit weight to that which will not excessively wear the transport infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.).
The heavy weight of these vehicles leads to severe consequences for other road users in crashes; they are over-involved in fatal crashes, and in a 2013 study in London, were found to cause a disproportionate number of the annual casualty toll of cyclists.

<doc id="961068" wikidata="Q862455" url="?curid=961068" title="Bill Shuster">
<text>William Franklin Shuster ( ; born January 10, 1961) is an American politician and lobbyist who served as the U.S. representative for from 2001 to 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party, and is a son of former Congressman Bud Shuster.

In January 2018, Shuster announced his retirement from Congress at the end of his eighth term, and did not run for re-election in 2018. He was succeeded as the Representative for PA-9 by fellow Republican Dan Meuser, although redistricting meant his actual district became the 13th which was won by Republican John Joyce, and as House Transportation Committee Chairman by Peter DeFazio (a Democrat from Oregon&#x27;s 4th district).

==Early life and career==
Shuster was born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, the son of H. Patricia (née Rommel) and Elmer Greinert &quot;Bud&quot; Shuster. His ancestry includes German and Irish. He graduated from Dickinson College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and in History. Shuster also became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity while at Dickinson. He then earned a Master of Business Administration from American University.

Prior to entering politics, Shuster worked on his family farm in Bedford County and at Goodyear Tire, Rubber Corporation, and Bandag Incorporated. He also owned and operated an automobile dealership in East Freedom, Pennsylvania.

==Elections to the House of Representatives==

===Special election (2001)===
After his father, Republican U.S. Congressman Bud Shuster, resigned from Congress in January 2001 following a strong rebuke from the House Ethics Committee for his relationship with a transportation lobbyist, Bill Shuster ran for Pennsylvania&#x27;s 9th congressional district. On February 18, 2001, he won the Republican nomination with 59% of the vote, defeating State Representative Patrick Fleagle (32%) and Blair County Commissioner John Eichelberger (9%). On May 15, 2001, Shuster won the special election, defeating Democratic Centre County Commissioner Scott Conklin 52%–44%. Shuster won nine of the district&#x27;s eleven counties. Conklin won Centre (58%) and Clearfield (55%). To date, it is the last time that a Democrat has come close to winning what has long been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania.

===Bush era elections (2002, 2004, and 2006)===
In the redistricting after the 2000 Census, Centre County was taken out of the district while portions of Somerset, Cambria, Indiana, Fayette, and Cumberland Counties were added to the district. In November 2002, the district reverted to form, and Shuster won his first full term, defeating John R. Henry 71%–29%.

Unlike 2002, Shuster was challenged in the 2004 Republican primary. He defeated businessman Michael DelGrosso 51%–49%. In November, he won re-election to his second full term, defeating Democrat Paul Politis 70%–30%, winning every county in the district.

Shuster won re-election to his third full term in 2006, defeating Democrat Tony Barr 60%–40%. He lost only three counties: Clearfield, Cambria, and Fayette.

===Obama era elections (2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014)===
Shuster won re-election to his fourth full term in 2008, defeating Democrat Tony Barr again, 64%–36%. This time he won all fourteen counties.

In 2010, Shuster won re-election to his fifth full term, defeating Democrat Tom Conners 73%–27%, winning all fourteen counties.

After redistricting following the 2010 Census, the 9th moved even further to the west, gaining portions of Westmoreland, Greene, and Washington Counties. Shuster won re-election to his sixth full term, defeating Democrat Karen Ramsburg 62%–38%. With the 113th Congress, elected in 2012, Bill Shuster became Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, a position he would hold for the following 2 Congresses.

In 2014, Shuster was in a primary with Bedford County businessman Art Halvorson and Franklin County project manager Travis Schooley. The primary was held on May 20, 2014. Shuster won with 53% of the vote. Art Halvorson received 34% and Travis Schooley received 13%.

In 2015, Shuster, who was the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman, said he was dating Shelley Rubino, the vice president of government affairs for Airlines for America (A4A), a lobbying group for airlines. &quot;Politico&quot; said their relationship had started in summer 2014 and had signed an agreement that Rubino would not lobby Shuster or his staff. Shuster, however, had other ties to A4A, having hired a former A4A executive onto the aviation subcommittee, and Shuster&#x27;s chief of staff is married to an executive of A4A. &quot;Politico&quot; also noted the similarity to his father&#x27;s conflicted lobbyist relationship and resignation.

===Trump era election (2016) and retirement===
In 2016, Shuster won reelection in what would later turn out to be his eighth and final full term. He was challenged by Arthur Halvorson in the Republican primary, with Shuster only barely winning a majority, at 50.6%, in the two-way race. Described as &quot;one of the more bizarre and nasty congressional campaigns&quot;, Shuster&#x27;s ex-wife was in his campaign ads, defending him and their family. In a set of events that even Shuster&#x27;s opponent described as unprecedented, Halvorson received enough write-ins in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate in the 9th district. Halvorson, who is considered to be further to the right than Shuster, accepted the Democratic nomination, but vowed to caucus as a conservative Republican if elected to Congress. In the general election, Shuster beat Halvorson again, this time with 63.3% of the vote.

Shuster announced in January 2018 that he wouldn&#x27;t be seeking reelection later that year, and that he thus would be retiring with the end of the 115th Congress in January 2019. The Congressman, who has been Chairman of the House Transportation Committee since 2013, said he would be spending his final year in the House working with President Trump on what he describes as a &quot;massive infrastructure bill&quot;. Shuster cited his desire to pass such a bill, and the fact that worrying about getting reelected would distract from that, as reasons for his retirement.

==Time in the House of Representatives==

===Political positions===
Shuster has been a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee since being elected in 2001 and was selected to be chairman of the committee for the 113th Congress. His father had chaired the committee from 1995 to 2001.

In 2013, as a member of the House Armed Services Committee as well, Shuster was an opponent of the $380 million Medium Extended Air Defense System project, which has been deemed too expensive by the Army to complete.

Shuster held a 90.64 percent lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union in 2012. He opposes abortion, consistently receiving a 0 percent rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood and a 100 percent rating from the National Right to Life Committee. A strong supporter of gun rights, Shuster has supported the interests of Gun Owners of America and received an A rating from the National Rifle Association in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Shuster does not rate highly with education unions. The National Education Association has given Shuster a grade of F and he was given a rating of 25 percent by the National Association of Elementary School Principals in 2007.

Shuster has received the &quot;Spirit of Enterprise Award&quot; from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and rated highly on the scorecards of the National Tax Limitation Committee and American Farm Bureau Federation.

Shuster was a state co-chair for the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.

In May 2013, Shuster introduced H.R. 2125, the No IRS Implementation of Obamacare Act; the bill sought to bar the stated that the Internal Revenue Service violated the public trust and cannot be relied on to implement the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

Shuster sponsored The Water Resources and Redevelopment Act of 2013 (WRRDA). He sponsored this bill from his position as the House Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

In January 2014, Shuster created a bipartisan panel of legislators to examine ways to use public-private partnerships to carry out various types of projects, such as water infrastructure, transportation and economic development, according to &quot;Ripon Advance&quot;.

===Legislation sponsored===
* Home Heating Emergency Assistance Through Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4076; 113th Congress) – Shuster introduced this bill on February 25, 2014. The bill would create an emergency exception to existing Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations. The exceptions would allow truckers to drive for long hours if they are delivering home heating fuels, such as propane, to places where there is a shortage. Shuster argued in favor of the bill saying that the bill &quot;will provide relief for millions of Americans suffering from the current propane and home heating fuel emergency.&quot; According to the Congressman, an &quot;exceptionally cold winter&quot; increased demand on propane, &quot;which is used for heating approximately 12 million homes in the United States.&quot;
* Transparent Airfares Act of 2014 (H.R. 4156; 113th Congress) – Shuster introduced this bill on March 6, 2014. The bill would change government regulations about how airlines advertise fares so that they could advertise the base fare and separately list the government imposed taxes and fees.

===Legislation supported===
The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress) is a bill that would amend laws that govern the activities of the United States Coast Guard (USCG), the Maritime Administration (MARAD) within the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC). Shuster spoke in favor of the bill, describing it as a bill that &quot;ensures the men and women of the Coast Guard have the tools they need to carry out their critical missions, enforce our laws on U.S. waters and on the high seas, and safeguard our Nation&#x27;s maritime interests around the world.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Armed Services
** Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities
* Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure (Chairman)
** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit
** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials
** Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment

<text>Messier 25, also known as IC 4725, is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of Sagittarius. The first recorded observation of this cluster was made by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux in 1745 and it was included in Charles Messier&#x27;s list of nebulous objects in 1764. The cluster is located near some obscuring features, with a dark lane passing near the center.

M25 is at a distance of about away from Earth and is 67.6 million years old. The spatial dimension of this cluster is about across. It has an estimated mass of , of which about 24% is interstellar matter. A Delta Cephei type variable star designated &quot;U Sagittarii&quot; is a member of this cluster, as are two red giants, one of which is a binary system.

New research indicates M25 may constitute a ternary star cluster together with NGC 6716 and Collinder 394.

<text>Grindleford is a village and civil parish in the county of Derbyshire, in the East Midlands of England. The population of the civil parish as taken at the 2011 Census was 909. It lies at an altitude of in the valley of the River Derwent in the Peak District National Park. The 17th-century Grindleford Bridge crosses the river on the western side of the village. 

On the west side of the valley is the high Sir William Hill, and to the south-east lies the gritstone escarpment of Froggatt Edge. Grindleford became a parish in 1987, merging the parishes of Eyam Woodlands, Stoke, Nether Padley and Upper Padley.

The nearest city to Grindleford is Sheffield, the centre of which is about away. For rail travellers, the Sheffield suburb of Totley is less than four miles away at the other end of the Totley Tunnel, the second-longest rail tunnel in the UK. Grindleford railway station (actually located in Upper Padley, half a mile away from the village) is at the western portal of the rail tunnel, on the scenic Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester.

Grindleford is popular with walkers and climbers due to its proximity to a variety of landscapes, including open moorland, wooded river valleys (including Padley Gorge), several gritstone escarpments, and the broad Hope Valley. Visitors seeking refreshment are well catered for by a number of establishments, including the Sir William Hotel, the Maynard Hotel and Bar, the National Trust Longshaw Estate Visitor Centre, and Grindleford Station Cafe (in the old station house).

== Education ==
The village has one school, Grindleford Primary School. It was rated as &quot;good&quot; in its March 2018 Ofsted report.

Hope Valley College runs a course in Painting and Drawing at Grindleford Pavilion.

The village&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Peak Advertiser&quot;.

==Padley Chapel==

Padley Hall (or Padley Manor) was a large double courtyard house where, in 1588, two Catholic priests (Nicholas Garlick and Robert Ludlam) were discovered and then, two weeks later, hanged, drawn and quartered in Derby. They became known as the &#x27;Padley Martyrs&#x27;. Padley Hall today is mostly in ruins, although part of it—probably originally the central gatehouse range—survives, and in 1933 was converted to a Roman Catholic chapel in honour of the martyrs. This was after the chapel had been a site of pilgrimage for several year, annual pilgrimages were set up by a priest from Sheffield. Organisation was taken on by the Guild of Our Lady of Ransom, and pilgrims walked from the nearby station to honour the Padley Martyrs.

The chapel, a Grade I listed building, stands not far from the railway line.

<text>Strychnos nux-vomica, the strychnine tree, also known as nux vomica, poison fruit, semen strychnos, and quaker buttons, is a deciduous tree native to India and to southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized tree in the family Loganiaceae that grows in open habitats. Its leaves are ovate and in size. It is known for being the natural source of the extremely poisonous compound strychnine.

== Description and properties ==

&quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot; is a medium-sized tree with a potential height of . Its trunk is short and thick. The wood is dense, hard, white, and close-grained. The branches are irregular and are covered with a smooth ashen bark. The young shoots are a deep green colour with a shiny coat. The leaves have an opposite decussate arrangement (each opposing pair of leaves at right angles to the next pair along the stem), are short stalked and oval shaped, have a shiny coat, and are smooth on both sides. The leaves are about long and wide. The flowers are small with a pale green colour and a funnel shape. They bloom in the cold season and have a foul smell. The fruit are about the size of a large apple with a smooth and hard shell that when ripened is a mild shade of orange in colour. The flesh of the fruit is soft and white with a jelly-like pulp containing five seeds covered with a soft, woolly substance.

The seeds have the shape of a flattened disk completely covered with hairs radiating from the center of the sides. This gives the seeds a very characteristic sheen. The seeds are very hard, with a dark gray horny endosperm where the small embryo is housed that gives off no odor but possesses a very bitter taste.
== Ecology ==
The toxic fruit is eaten by monkeys and birds, such as the gray langur. It is also commonly eaten by hornbill species.

== Toxicity ==
It is a major source of the highly poisonous, intensely bitter alkaloids strychnine and brucine derived from the seeds inside the tree&#x27;s round, green to orange fruit. The seeds contain approximately 1.5% strychnine, and the dried blossoms contain 1.0%. However, the tree&#x27;s bark also contains brucine and other poisonous compounds.

== Uses ==
The strychnine-containing seeds have been used in arrow poison. The use of strychnine is highly regulated in many countries, and it is mostly used in baits to kill feral mammals. Most accidental poisoning is caused by breathing in the powder or by absorption through the skin. 

&quot;Strychnos&quot; is promoted within alternative medicine as a treatment for many conditions, but the claims are not supported by medical evidence. 

=== Herbalism ===

&quot;Strychnos&quot; is promoted within herbal medicine as being a treatment for a wide range of maladies, including cancer and heart disease. There is, however, no evidence it is useful for treating any condition. Indeed, these seeds contain strychnine. The plant appears on the Commission E list of unapproved herbs because it has not been proven to be safe or effective and thus is not recommended for use. Use of strychnine seeds for such purposes may prove fatal as strychnine is a highly toxic compound and has no safe limit for consumption.

In Unani medicine (Perso-Arabic traditional medicine), &quot;hudar&quot; is a mixture containing &quot;Strychnos nux-vomica&quot;. The seeds are first immersed in water for five days and then in milk for two days followed by their boiling in milk.
The level of toxic alkaloids in the unprocessed &quot;Strychnos&quot; seeds used in traditional medicines can be determined using established HPLC methods and HPLC-UV methods.

<doc id="961132" wikidata="Q3646340" url="?curid=961132" title="Bud Shuster">
<text>Elmer Greinert &quot;Bud&quot; Shuster ( ; January 23, 1932 – April 19, 2023) was an American politician who represented Pennsylvania&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives as a Republican from 1973 to 2001. He was best known for his advocacy of transportation projects, including Interstate 99.

==Early life and career==
Shuster was born in the Pittsburgh suburb of Glassport, Pennsylvania, the son of Grace (née Greinert) and Prather Leroy Shuster. He received his B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh in 1954, where he became a member of Sigma Chi, an M.B.A. from Duquesne University in 1960, and a Ph.D. from American University in 1967. Shuster&#x27;s official congressional biography states that he served in the United States Army from 1954 to 1956. However, in one of his several books, &quot;Believing in America,&quot; published in 1983, Shuster stated that he was the class president at the University of Pittsburgh and was recruited by the local CIA office on campus and that this was his actual first employment. Shuster described his role as that of infiltrating civil rights groups eerily similar to COINTELPRO operations of the FBI. Shuster claimed that communist groups were penetrating the civil rights movement to provoke the police into attacking the demonstrators who were marching for equal rights for African-Americans. He claimed communists did this to embarrass the United States in front of the world. His book completely contradicts his later claims to have been in the military. After leaving behind college and military life, Shuster entered the business world. He became a vice president at RCA, and he made a fortune when he started his own computer business.

==Congressional service==
In 1972, Shuster decided to enter politics when he entered the Republican primary for the Pennsylvania&#x27;s 9th Congressional District. The district had previously been the 12th, represented by five-term Republican J. Irving Whalley, who was retiring. He defeated popular state senator D. Elmer Hawbaker of Mercersburg in the Republican primary–the real contest in what has long been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania. The 9th and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but six years since 1927. He breezed to the election that November.

Shuster&#x27;s election to Congress was on the coattails of President Nixon&#x27;s sweeping re-election victory. As the Watergate revelations against those closest to the president mounted, Shuster adamantly supported the president. Even after the Saturday Night Massacre, in which independent counsel Archibald Cox was fired because he refused to back down in the face of an order by the president to withdraw a subpoena for White House tapes, an event which severely eroded Congressional Republican support and set in motion the impeachment process, Shuster chose to strike out against Cox. On October 31, 1973, Shuster introduced House Resolution 677, which called for an investigation by Congress of Archibald Cox and the staff of the Special Prosecutor&#x27;s office &quot;to determine the extent of criminal violations&quot; and send the findings to the Justice Department for prosecution. He accompanied the resolution with a statement about Cox: &quot;This pompous, pious, self-righteous, supposedly independent special prosecutor is far worse than just political.&quot; The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee on November 15, 1973, where it died. A year later, even as many Republicans went down to defeat in the face of anti-Watergate backlash, Shuster won a second term with 56 percent of the vote.

In Congress, Shuster was one of the opponents of the automobile airbag. He ran for the position of Minority Whip in 1980, losing to Trent Lott. Shuster chaired the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure from 1995 to 2001. He also served as Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Shuster usually skated to re-election. His bid for a second term would be the only time he would drop below 60 percent of the vote. His most notable challenger came in 1984 when Nancy Kulp, the actress who played Miss Jane Hathaway on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; won the Democratic nomination. Kulp, a native of Pennsylvania, had returned to her home state upon her retirement from acting and received support from her friends in Hollywood. Kulp&#x27;s former co-star Buddy Ebsen, a Republican, contacted the Shuster campaign and volunteered to record radio spots declaring, &quot;Hey Nancy, I love you dearly but you&#x27;re too liberal for me – I&#x27;ve got to go with Bud Shuster.&quot; Shuster went on to win re-election with two-thirds of the vote. It would be the next-to-last time he would face any opposition at all; from 1986 to 2000, only one Democrat even filed to run against him.

Shuster is best known for taking on his party leadership and U.S. President Bill Clinton in the 1990s to keep more of the taxes on motor fuels and air travel in the dedicated federal trust funds they were supposed to go to by law. Shuster won both battles, even though then U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Clinton united to oppose him, wanting to keep the funds available for borrowing for other programs.

Those victories meant during his time as chairman numerous transportation projects were funded, including Interstate 99, the only Interstate highway to have its route number (a violation of the usual Interstate numbering standard) written into law. The route was later named the &quot;Bud Shuster Highway&quot; by Governor Robert Casey. When the transportation authorization bill known by its initials as &quot;BESTEA&quot; was under consideration, his fellow members joked the letters stood for the &quot;Bud E. Shuster Transportation for All Eternity Act&quot; for its many &quot;pork barrel&quot; projects.

In 1996, Shuster was the focus of an ethics investigation by the Congressional Accountability Project stemming from the complex relationship between Representative Shuster and Ann Eppard, a former Shuster aide turned lobbyist, and Rep. Shuster&#x27;s interventions with federal agencies on behalf of a business partner of his sons.

In 1998, Eppard was indicted for taking bribes to influence federal action on Boston&#x27;s Big Dig highway construction project. In addition, she was accused of having embezzled money from Shuster&#x27;s reelection committee when she served as its assistant treasurer. In 1999, Eppard pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor charge of receiving improper compensation and paid a $5,000 fine. Eppard died on December 24, 2005.

==Retirement==
Shuster resigned from Congress on February 3, 2001, just a month after being sworn in for a 15th term. While he claimed health problems, he had also been forced to give up his chairmanship due to a Republican policy of a six-year term limit for committee chairmen. He was succeeded by his son Bill who was elected in a special election that May.

==After politics==
Shuster retired from politics, but he served as Visiting Assistant Professor of Political Science at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania, from which he received an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree. Shuster died at his farm in Everett, Pennsylvania, on April 19, 2023, at the age of 91, from complications of a hip fracture he sustained two weeks earlier.

<text>Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him is the first comedy album recorded by the Firesign Theatre. It was originally released in January 1968 by Columbia Records.

==Synopsis==
The first side of the original LP presented a trilogy of three related plays, presented as continuously connected tracks progressing in time. The second side presented a longer, separate play.

===&quot;Temporarily Humboldt County&quot;===
The first section runs 9 min 14 sec, and satirizes the displacement of the American Indians (David Ossman and Phil Austin), first by Spanish conquistadors, then by American frontiersmen, and finally by the US government forcing them onto a reservation, which it uses as a &quot;cobalt testing range&quot;. The title comes from friends of the Firesign Theatre telling them that the local Indians in Humboldt County, California added &quot;temporarily&quot; to the name as a way of saying no one could really own the land and to give it the initialism THC. The section ends with a bomb explosion, followed by the sound of wind blowing, and the Indians coming out of it portraying a raid in a Hollywood western.

===&quot;W. C. Fields Forever&quot;===
This 7 min 39 sec track segues as the Indians wander silently through the desert and come upon Peter Bergman welcoming them to the &quot;Lazy O Magic Circle Dudes Ranch and Collective Love Farm&quot;, a hippie commune. The commune&#x27;s spiritual leader, the perpetually drunk/stoned &quot;Tiny Doctor Tim&quot; (Proctor), is a parody of Timothy Leary. Philip Proctor&#x27;s impersonation of W. C. Fields actually appeared on the first track, dedicating the cobalt testing range; this track title parodies the Beatles song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

===&quot;Le Trente-Huit Cunégonde&quot;===
This 7 min 19 sec track segues into a future world in which the 1960s hippie counterculture has now replaced the mainstream cultural establishment. Police (Proctor and Bergman) patrol searching for &quot;non-groovy&quot; people &quot;not&quot; in possession of drugs, such as a grandmother (Austin) whom they arrest to be &quot;returned for re-grooving&quot;. A teenager named Malcolm X John Lennon (Austin) is still being breast-fed by his mother (Proctor), and gets in trouble with his school principal (Proctor) for studying instead of hanging out and &quot;relating&quot; with his peers by smoking marijuana. A US senator who sounds like Robert F. Kennedy (Proctor) chairs a committee which also returns people for re-grooving, and the &quot;Secretary of Peace&quot; (Ossman) directs bomber aircraft to drop copies of &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; on Nigeria.

===Side two: &quot;Waiting for The Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot;===
This single, 17 min 48 sec track begins as a Turkish language instruction record, and immediately follows its listener on a Kafkaesque trip overseas. An unnamed innocent (Austin) is manipulated by mysterious strangers and authority figures into situations beyond his control. (In the written script, the character is called simply &quot;P.&quot; for Phil, a reference to Kafka&#x27;s use of &quot;K.&quot; in &quot;The Castle.&quot;)

A highlight of side two is the &quot;Beat the Reaper&quot; sketch, a mock game show in which the contestant (Austin) is injected with a disease and must guess what it is in order to win the antidote; if the contestant fails to self-diagnose, he is sent home with the disease. This segment is also featured on both the &quot;Forward Into The Past&quot; and &quot;Shoes for Industry: The Best of the Firesign Theatre&quot; compilation albums.

==Issues and reissues==
&quot;Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him&quot; was originally released on Mono LP, Stereo LP, and 8-Track.
* Mono LP: Columbia CL-2718
* Stereo LP: Columbia CS-9518
* 8 track: 18C-09518

It has been re-released on CD at least three times

* 1992: Mobile Fidelity MFCD-762
* 2001: Sony
* 2001: Laugh.com LGH1071

Some of the 2001 Sony CDs omit the first 16 seconds of the beginning of track 4 due to a mastering error. The defective Sony re-release and some non-defective copies also end with an un-marked bonus track &quot;The Mantras and The Chakras&quot;. This track, lasting 4:08, is not included on any other Firesign release.

==Cover==

On the cover of the LP the name of the group is rendered &quot;Firesign &quot;Theater&quot;.&quot; On their next album, &quot;How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You&#x27;re Not Anywhere at All,&quot; the name is spelled &quot;Firesign &quot;Theatre&quot;.&quot; The latter spelling has been used consistently since that time.

<text>Messier 26, also known as NGC 6694, is an open cluster of stars in the southern constellation of Scutum. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764. This 8th magnitude cluster is a challenge to find in ideal skies with typical binoculars, where it can be, with any modern minimum aperture device. It is south-southwest of the open cluster Messier 11 and is across. About 25 stars are visible in a telescope with a aperture.

M26 spans a linear size of 22 light years across with a tidal radius of , and is at a distance of 5,160 light years from the Earth. The brightest star is of magnitude 11 and the age of this cluster has been calculated to be 85.3 million years. It includes one known spectroscopic binary system.

An interesting feature of M26 is a region of low star density near the nucleus. A hypothesis was that it was caused by an obscuring cloud of interstellar matter between us and the cluster, but a paper by James Cuffey suggested that this is not possible and that it really is a &quot;shell of low stellar space density&quot;. In 2015, Michael Merrifield of the University of Nottingham said that there is, as yet, no clear explanation for the phenomenon.

<doc id="961147" wikidata="Q3306669" url="?curid=961147" title="Merv Tweed">
<text>Mervin C. Tweed (born August 6, 1955) is a retired politician in Manitoba, Canada. He represented Brandon—Souris in the House of Commons of Canada from 2004 to August 31, 2013. Prior to that he was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1995 to 2004, representing the constituency of Turtle Mountain. He was the president of Omnitrax, the American rail company responsible for the Churchill rail line.

Tweed was born in Medora, Manitoba, and was educated at Brandon University. He operated a used car dealership for seventeen years, and was for a time an executive member of the Killarney and Area Recreation Committee.

==Municipal politician==

Tweed began his political career in municipal politics, serving as a councillor in the rural municipality of Brenda for five years, and as deputy reeve for three. Tweed returned to municipal politics in 2021 after being elected mayor of the Municipality of Killarney-Turtle Mountain

==Provincial politician (1995–2004)==

In 1995, he was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a Progressive Conservative in Turtle Mountain, a safe seat for the party. He served as a parliamentary assistant to a variety of ministers in the government of Premier Gary Filmon before being appointed Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism with responsibility for the Development Corporation Act on February 5, 1999.

Tweed was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election, although the Progressive Conservatives were defeated at the provincial level by the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer. Tweed resigned his cabinet portfolio with the rest of the Filmon ministry.

Despite the NDP&#x27;s landmark election win of 2003, Tweed was again re-elected in Turtle Mountain without difficulty, receiving 3,956 votes against 1,893 for New Democrat Lonnie Patterson.

==Federal politician (2004–2013)==

When federal Conservative MP Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris), announced his retirement in 2004, Tweed resigned his provincial seat and won the Conservative nomination for the riding. He received 18,209 votes in the general election, against 8,522 for Liberal Murray Downing.

Following the 2004 election, Tweed was named opposition critic for Western Economic Diversification by Conservative leader Stephen Harper. In April 2006, Tweed was elected chairperson of House of Commons of Canada&#x27;s Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, a post he held until September 25, 2012 when he was elected chairperson of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. His resignation took effect on August 31, 2013. Tweed went on to work as President of OmniTRAX Canada, which operates, amongst others, the Port of Churchill.

<text>Alba (; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of Piedmont, Italy, in the Province of Cuneo. It is one of the main cities in the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato. The town is famous for its white truffle and wine production. The confectionery group Ferrero is based there. The city joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in October 2017.

== History ==

Alba&#x27;s origins date from before the Roman civilization, connected probably to the presence of Celtic and Ligurian tribes in the area.

The modern town occupies the site of ancient Alba Pompeia, the name given after being officially recognized as a town by the Roman consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo while constructing a road from Aquae Statiellae (Acqui) to Augusta Taurinorum (Turin). Alba was the birthplace of Publius Helvius Pertinax, briefly Roman emperor in 193.

After the fall of the Western Empire, the city was repeatedly sacked by Ostrogoths, Burgundians, Byzantines, Lombards, Franks, Hungarians and Saracens. In the 11th century it became a free commune (or city-state) and was a member of the Lombard League. Montferrat and the Visconti fought over the town; later it became a possession of the Gonzaga. Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy conquered it twice, while later France and Spain battled for its possession. The Treaty of Cherasco (1631) assigned Alba definitively to Savoy. During Napoleonic Wars, it was part of the Republic of Alba (1796) and of the Subalpine Republic, both French clients, before being annexed to the French Empire in 1802. It was an arrondissement center in firstly Tanaro department between 1802 and 1805, later in Stura one between 1805 and 1814 before liberation by Austrian troops. It was returned to the Kingdom of Sardinia (Duchy of Savoy&#x27;s name after gaining Sardinia in 1720) in 1814.

Alba won a Gold Medal for Military Valour for the heroic activity of its citizens in the Italian resistance movement during the course of World War II. On 10 October 1944, the town was liberated by partisans who established a Republic of Alba which for a few weeks was able to maintain its independence from the Fascist Republic of Salò. The republic lasted until 2 November 1944, when the Republic of Salo retook it. French troops finally liberated it on 2 May 1945.

==Geography==
Approximately located at about 50 km from the cities of Turin and Cuneo, Alba is placed on the right side of the river Tanaro. The climate is typically drier than in other lands at the north of the Po river.

== Main sights ==
Of the Roman city, which had a polygonal form, parts of the fortified gate and remains of some edifices with marble and mosaics can still be seen.

Other attractions include:
*Palazzo Comunale (13th century): city hall housing a &quot;Nativity&quot; (1501) by Macrino d&#x27;Alba.
*City towers (14th and 15th centuries): Alba was once known as the &quot;City with hundred towers&quot;.
*Duomo of San Lorenzo (12th-century): Roman Catholic cathedral built in Romanesque style, probably atop an Ancient Roman temple. It was restructured multiple times over the centuries, starting in the 15th century in a reconstruction patronized by bishop Andrea Novelli. The current appearance derives from a controversial 19th-century restoration; however, the three portals and the crypt remain from the original edifice. The church is well known for its wood-carved choir made in 1512 by Bernardino Fossati. The current belfry, from the 12th century, includes the original bell tower entirely.
*San Domenico (13th-14th centuries): Gothic architecture church housing much of the most salient sacred artworks in town. It has a noteworthy portal with a triple arch within a pointed arch, a polygonal apse, and traces of Renaissance frescoes. During the Napoleonic Wars it was used a stable, but reconsecrated on 22 June 1827.
*St John the Baptist (San Giovanni Battista): Baroque architecture church housing a &quot;Madonna of the Graces&quot; (1377) by Barnaba da Modena and a &quot;Madonna with Saints&quot; (1508) by Macrino d&#x27;Alba.
*Santa Maria Maddalena (late-18th century): small late-Baroque church designed by Bernardo Antonio Vittone and housing the relics of Blessed Margaret of Savoy.

The city museums include the Federico Eusebio Civic Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences.

<text>Messier 28 or M28, also known as NGC 6626, is a globular cluster of stars in the center-west of Sagittarius. It was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764. He briefly described it as a &quot;nebula containing no star... round, seen with difficulty in 3-foot telescope; Diam 2′.&quot;

In the sky it is less than a degree to the northwest of the 3rd magnitude star Kaus Borealis (Lambda ). This cluster is faintly visible as a hazy patch with a pair of binoculars and can be readily found in a small telescope with an aperture, showing as a nebulous feature spanning 11.2 arcminutes. Using an aperture of , the core becomes visible and a few distinct stars can be resolved, along the periphery. Larger telescopes will provide greater resolution, one of revealing a dense 2′ core, with more density within.

It is about 18,300 light-years away from Earth. It is about and its metallicity (averaging −1.32 which means more than 10 times less than our own star), coherency and preponderence of older stellar evolution objects, support its dating to very roughly 12 billion years old. 18 RR Lyrae type variable stars have been found within. 

It bore the first discovery of a millisecond pulsar in a globular cluster – PSR B1821–24. This was using the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, England. A total of 11 further of these have since been detected in it with the telescope at Green Bank Observatory, West Virginia. As of 2011, these number the third-most in a cluster tied to the Milky Way, following Terzan 5 and 47 Tucanae.

<text>Messier 29 or M29, also known as NGC 6913 or the Cooling Tower Cluster, is a quite small, bright open cluster of stars just south of the central bright star Gamma Cygni of a northerly zone of the sky, Cygnus. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764, and can be seen from Earth by using binoculars.

M29 is well within the several degrees of the arms and bulge of the Milky Way. It is at least many hundreds of light years short of the yardstick distance to the Galactic Center, as is between 4,000 and 7,200 light years away. A 1998 popular work gives a value within this range. Data from Gaia EDR3 gives a parallactic distance of about 5,240 light years. The uncertainty is due to poorly known absorption of the cluster&#x27;s light. Its extinction greatly is from faint surrounding nebulosity and other foreground interstellar matter of this cross-section of the spiral arms (see Orion–Cygnus Arm, which is our local arm).

According to the Sky Catalogue, M29 is included in the Cygnus OB1 association, and the radial velocity component of three-dimensional motion, by default factoring in the solar system&#x27;s current trajectory, is one of approaching at 28 km/s (noted, thus, as negative). Its age is estimated at 10 million years, as its five hottest stars are all giants of spectral class B0. Kepple and his associates give the apparent brightness of the brightest star as eighth magnitude of in the mid-wavelength (and frequency) &quot;visual&quot; band. 

The cluster&#x27;s absolute magnitude is estimated at −8.2, a luminosity of 160,000 solar luminosities (). The linear diameter was estimated at only 11 light years. Its Trumpler class is III,3,p,n (as it is associated with nebulosity), although Götz gives, differently, II,3,m, and Kepple gives I,2,m,n. The Sky Catalogue lists it with 50 member stars; earlier Becvar estimated 20 members.

North of 47 degrees north, the cluster is for part or all of the day above the horizon. It can be made out in binoculars in a good sky. In telescopes, lowest powers are best. The brightest of its stars form a &quot;stubby dipper&quot;, per Mallas. The four brightest stars form a quadrilateral, and another set a small triangle just north of the northernmost of the four. It is often known as the &quot;cooling tower&quot; due to its resemblance to the hyperboloid-shaped structures. A few fainter stars are around them, but the cluster appears quite isolated, especially in smaller telescopes. In photographs, many faint Milky Way background stars appear.

Messier 29 can be found quite easily as it is about 1.7 degrees south of Gamma or 37 Cygni (Sadr). Angularly close, and almost certainly nearby in space, is diffuse nebulosity.

The especially hot binary Wolf–Rayet star WR 143 (WC4+Be) (HD 195177) can be found near this cluster.

<text>Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc) is a private architecture school in Los Angeles, California. SCI-Arc was founded in 1972 when it was initially regarded as both institutionally and artistically avant-garde. It consists of approximately 500 students and 80 faculty members, some of whom are practicing architects. It is based in the quarter-mile long () former Santa Fe Freight Depot in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles. It also offers community events such as outreach programs, free exhibitions, and public lectures.

== History ==

SCI-Arc was founded in 1972 in Santa Monica by Ray Kappe, Shelly Kappe, Ahde Lahti, Thom Mayne, Bill Simonian, Glen Small, and James Stafford, a group of faculty from the Department of Architecture at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. The founders were frustrated with how the administrators at Cal Poly treated the students and faculty members, and they wanted to address the issue from a more experimental perspective than traditional schools offered.

Originally called the New School, SCI-Arc was based on the concept of a &quot;college without walls,&quot; and it remains one of the few independent architecture schools in the world. Initially, instead of academic hierarchies, the School favoured a horizontal relationship between professors and students, who took responsibility for their own course of study. Kappe, who had founded the Cal Poly department, became the new school&#x27;s first director and served in that position until 1987. He was awarded the AIA/ACSA Topaz Medal for excellence in architecture education in 1990.

Kappe was succeeded as director by Michael Rotondi, one of SCI-Arc&#x27;s original students. Neil Denari became director in 1997; Eric Owen Moss served as director from 2002–2015; Hernán Díaz Alonso was appointed director and chief executive officer effective Sept 1, 2015. Díaz Alonso has been a faculty member at SCI-Arc since 2001. He is known for championing the school&#x27;s push toward a digital future and, prior to his appointment as director, has served as the school&#x27;s graduate programs chair since 2010.

Although SCI-Arc was once unaccredited and its finances unstable—Moss joked, &quot;We used to be considered one step ahead of the IRS, one step ahead of creditors&quot;—the school is now fully accredited, and its finances improved to the point that SCI-Arc was able to pay $23.1 million to buy its campus building in 2011. &quot;The main thing is to figure out a way for SCI-Arc to keep growing without losing its character and pedigree,&quot; Díaz Alonso said in an interview following his appointment as director.

== Campus ==
The school has been based in three locations—the first (1972-1992) a small industrial building in Santa Monica, and later moved into the second, larger (concrete post &amp; beam) industrial building (1992-2000) in Marina del Rey.

In 2001, it moved to its current building, the 60,000-square-foot 1907 Santa Fe Freight Depot designed by Harrison Albright on the eastern edge of Downtown Los Angeles. When SCI-Arc arrived, the building was a stripped-down concrete shell. Today the building is on the National Register of Historic Places and the school has become an anchor for the city&#x27;s Arts District.

The school conducts design projects that engage with under-served members of the community. To these ends, SCI-Arc has been awarded a $400,000 grant by ArtPlace to develop two on-campus public performance/lecture spaces, as well as development for a third public venue in the surrounding arts district. Across the street, &quot;One Santa Fe,&quot; a 438-unit apartment complex designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture (MMA) opened in 2014.

== Academics ==
SCI-Arc offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board and the WASC Senior College and University Commission, including a five-year Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) program, a 3-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 1) open to applicants who hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or equivalent in any field of study, and a 2-year Master of Architecture (M.Arch 2) open to applicants with a prior undergraduate degree in architecture.

In addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, SCI-Arc offers four one-year postgraduate programs in fields including architectural technologies, entertainment and fiction, design of cities, and theory and pedagogy.

SCI-Arc&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs culminate in two public events in which students present their thesis projects to renowned critics from around the world, including Peter Cook, Greg Lynn, and Pritzker Prize recipient Thom Mayne. &quot;SCI-Arc has long been one of this country&#x27;s best experimental labs in which designers speculate about the future of the human-made environment, and its thesis projects are its calling cards.&quot;

A recent program and exhibition, &quot;LA in Wien/Wien in LA,&quot; investigated the architecture of Los Angeles and Vienna and their respective influences on one another in over the last century. It brought together six esteemed international architects—Hitoshi Abe, Peter Cook, Eric Owen Moss, Thom Mayne, Peter Noever, and Wolf Prix of Coop Himmelb(l)au—to share their perspectives and experiences in a discussion led by Anthony Vidler. The full scope of SCI-Arc public programs includes lectures, exhibitions, faculty talks and other opportunities for interaction between the school and the community.

<text>Messier 30 (also known as M30, NGC 7099, or the Jellyfish Cluster) is a globular cluster of stars in the southeast of the southern constellation of Capricornus, at about the declination of the Sun when the latter is at December solstice. It was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764, who described it as a circular nebula without a star. In the New General Catalogue, compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a &quot;remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval.&quot; It can be easily viewed with a pair of 10×50 binoculars, forming a patch of hazy light some 4 arcminutes wide that is slightly elongated along the east–west axis. With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12 arcminutes across graduating into a compressed core about one arcminute wide that has further star density within. 

It is longest observable (opposed to the Sun) in the first half of August.

M30 is centered 27,100 light-years away from Earth with a roughly 2.5% margin of error, and is about 93 light-years across. The estimated age is roughly 12.9 billion years and it forms a mass of about 160,000 times the mass of the Sun (). The cluster is following a retrograde orbit (against the general flow) through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a satellite galaxy rather than forming within the Milky Way. It is in this epoch , from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated for the Sun.

The cluster has passed through a dynamic process called core collapse and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the Sun&#x27;s mass per cubic parsec. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create binary star systems, as well as a type of star called a blue straggler that is formed by mass transfer. A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster.

<doc id="961186" wikidata="Q5265273" url="?curid=961186" title="Destiny Church (New Zealand)">
<text>Destiny Church is a New Zealand Christian fundamentalist organisation variously described as a church, a religious movement, or a cult. Based in South Auckland and with a strong Māori conservative character, Destiny Church&#x27;s direction and ideology is highly personalised around its leader and founder, Brian Tamaki, whose title is &quot;Apostle Bishop&quot;, and his wife Hannah Tamaki. The couple founded Destiny Church in 1998, and quick growth led to it peaking in 2003 with approximately 5,000 members. As of the 2018 New Zealand Census, the organisation has a recorded 1,772 followers, under a third of the 6,000 claimed by Tamaki.

Destiny Church describes itself as an &quot;iwi-tapu&quot; or a &quot;spiritual tribe of God&#x27;s people&quot;. Its structure is Pentecostalist, with Tamaki preaching the prosperity gospel to his largely low-socioeconomic base, who are overwhelmingly Māori and Pasifika. Destiny Church&#x27;s far-right ideology has been described as authoritarian. The group advocates strict adherence to Biblical morality, and has a reputation for its vitriolic position against homosexuality, for its patriarchal views and for its calls for a return to Biblical conservative family values and morals.

In the 2000s, Destiny Church expanded outside of Auckland; this was mostly across the Upper North Island, but there is also a branch in Wellington, two in the South Island, and one in Australia on the Gold Coast in Queensland, which has a very significant Māori population. Rising to prominence in the 2000s, Destiny Church sponsored a nationwide rally against civil unions, attempted to build a commune, and issued a DVD which labelled the Government of New Zealand as &quot;evil&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tamaki incorporated anti-vaccination conspiracy theories into the group&#x27;s ideology, including the denial of the virus&#x27; existence altogether. Tamaki soon became extremely opposed to lockdowns and mask mandates in New Zealand, and the group partook in the 2022 Wellington anti-vaccine protest. Various small political parties split from the group to contest the 2020 and 2023 New Zealand general elections, including Freedoms New Zealand, Vision NZ, and the New Nation Party, none of which gained more than 0.5% of the party vote.

Since the beginning of the Israel–Hamas war, the group has strongly backed Israel and performed haka to show support for the Israel Defence Forces. Tamaki&#x27;s actions and rhetoric have attracted criticism from the New Zealand media and from other public figures. He has been criticised for blaming the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on the &quot;sexual perversion&quot; of gay people, and for holding a gathering of 700 men who swore a &quot;covenant&quot;
oath of allegiance, obedience, and deference to him. For his actions, Tamaki has run afoul of the law, having been imprisoned for breaching bail conditions as he took part in an anti-vaccination protest in Christchurch.
==Organisation==
===Leadership===

Described by Māori religious expert Peter Lineham as &quot;Māori-focused&quot;, Destiny Church is led by Brian Tamaki and his wife Hannah Tamaki, who hold the positions of Visionary and Senior Ministers. The Tamakis established the organisation together in 1998 as a splinter from their previous investment, Lake City Church in Rotorua. Their three adult children Jasmine, Jamie, and Samuel are all actively involved in the church ministry. Samuel and his wife pastor the Destiny church on the Gold Coast in Australia, Jamie and her husband are the CEO of ManUp and Legacy International, Jasmine and her husband facilitate social services within the ManUp and Legacy organisation. Brian and Hannah have 5 generations of their family in Destiny Church. Following a unanimous agreement by the then 19 other pastors of Destiny Churches throughout New Zealand, Tamaki was ordained as a bishop during a ceremony performed by kaumātua and Destiny Pastor, Manuel Renata, on 18 June 2005. The church&#x27;s leadership encourage obedience to its teachings and its rhetoric has sometimes alienated other churches that have different approaches to Christianity. In 2003, Tamaki, in what he described as a prophetic utterance, predicted that Destiny would be &quot;ruling the nation&quot; within five years.

===Ministry===
The church claims to provide not only biblical guidance and teaching but also a range of social services including budget advice, family and parenting advice, support for drug and alcohol abusers, anger management and resolution, provision of food and housing. Church services are energetic and have a Pentecostal worship style. The preaching and teaching is strongly conservative, literalist interpretation of Biblical teachings. Its membership is predominantly Māori and Polynesian, intergenerational, and from all levels of the socio-economic sections of New Zealand society. Māori religious expert Peter Lineham has said of the church&#x27;s followers: &quot;they stem from the endemic Māori struggle to find a secure space in Western capitalist society, although there are obviously huge differences between the rural Māori that Rātana reached out to and the urban Māori community that has flocked to Tamaki. The development of a socially and politically active Christianity was a logical response in both cases.&quot;

===Locations and membership===
Destiny Church is located in South Auckland, New Zealand. The current site is in Wiri, and houses the church auditorium and its administration offices, a chapel, a multipurpose room, a fitness/boxing gym, a medical centre, an early childhood centre and school. The church began in Rotorua as &quot;Lake City Church&quot;, which had a membership of 20 people. Within two years, it had grown to 300 members. Over the years, Destiny churches were established in the following locations:

At its peak in 2003, Destiny Church had a network of 19 church branches throughout New Zealand, with a total membership in excess of 5,000. By June 2012 it had 11 remaining branches, with around 3000 regular attendees. In 2019, Brian Tamaki claimed the church had in excess of 6,000 members. However, in the 2018 census, just 1,772 gave their religion as &quot;Destiny Church&quot;, less than did for the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (4248) and Jediism (20,409), and only slightly more than Zoroastrianism. In the aftermath, NZME described Destiny Church&#x27;s membership as &quot;surprisingly low&quot;, while &quot;The Spinoff&quot; went further, describing Destiny Church as &quot;utterly marginal&quot;. Church branches have closed in Porirua (the second in Wellington, after Petone), Wanganui and Dunedin. By June 2013, Destiny Church Wanganui was no longer listed on the main church website. In addition, other branches such as Kaitaia, Ōpōtiki, Taumarunui, and Hawkes Bay had either closed down or merged with other church branches. Destiny Church has also expanded to Australia, with one branch formerly in Brisbane and a current one on the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast has a very significant Māori population.

===Broadcasting===
Destiny TV, a televangelist ministry, launched in 2001 and produced 30-minute programmes that ran every weekday morning on New Zealand&#x27;s national television broadcaster. The programmes were funded by donations from Destiny Church members. TVNZ ceased to broadcast the programme in late 2004 just after the formation of the Destiny New Zealand political party. , Destiny TV still operates as the video production arm of Destiny Church. Weekly Destiny TV programmes are available for streaming on Destiny Church&#x27;s website.

=== Destiny School ===
The church also operates a composite school (catering for both primary and secondary students), known as Destiny School, which uses the Cambridge education system alongside the New Zealand curriculum.

==History==
===Origins===
The Destiny Church movement was founded in 1998 from 20 members of Lake City Church in Rotorua, initially calling itself City Church Auckland. Destiny Church was founded by Brian Tamaki and his wife Hannah Tamaki, who continue to serve as Visionary and Senior Ministers of Destiny Church. Destiny Church had a close relationship with New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, USA, the church of Bishop Eddie Long. In his autobiography Tamaki described meeting Long, &quot;my spiritual father&quot;, in 2002. Historian Peter Lineham has compared Destiny Church&#x27;s liturgy progression away from orthodox Christianity to the late 1920s Ratana movement&#x27;s divergence and eventual excommunication. Lineham also notes the usages of the historic and strong belief within Christianity in Māoridom to promote his reach and teachings.

===Enough is Enough rally===
Destiny Church has campaigned for a return to what it considers to be &quot;Christian moral values&quot; in New Zealand society, particularly for the &quot;sanctity of marriage between a husband and wife&quot;. In August 2004, Destiny members marched on Parliament under their &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; rally which drew 5000 protesters against civil unions legislation. The rally attracted considerable criticism. The black T-shirts and track-pants worn by many of the marchers prompted negative comparisons with Nazi storm-troopers in the New Zealand media. When the rally was in progress, Tamaki indicated that he did not want to be a politician, saying, &quot;I have a higher calling than a politician, I am a man of God.&quot; A second march occurred in Auckland along with the Christian Life Centre and the City Impact Churches on 5 March 2005.

===Plans for a &quot;Destiny City&quot;===
On 29 October 2008 it was reported that Destiny Church was planning on building a holy city in South Auckland. The report was based on comments made by Brian Tamaki at the church&#x27;s 10th birthday celebration, and released on DVD, where he talks about a site the church had procured, with a budget of $2.4m. He said the community would have its own maraes and medical facilities and that &quot;every child of every member of this church will never go to a state school again&quot;. The church subsequently denied the report, a spokesperson saying they only intended to build a new headquarters and supply &quot;social help&quot; programmes, despite Rotorua&#x27;s &quot;Daily Post&quot; quoting Tamaki as saying Destiny planned to create a &quot;city within a city&quot; in 2006. At the Church&#x27;s 2012 annual conference in Rotorua, Tamaki presented plans including a library, bookshop, early childhood centre, three schools and a university and encouraged tithing, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t care what the media say, I don&#x27;t care what your relatives say, I don&#x27;t care what the world says, nobody should be not tithing.&quot; In December 2012, Destiny Church moved its headquarters to a section in Wiri, South Auckland.

===Momentum conference and pledge of allegiance===
In October 2009, about 700 male members of the church attended a conference called &quot;MoMENtum&quot; in which Tamaki likened himself to King David. Attendees swore a &quot;covenant oath&quot; of loyalty and obedience to Tamaki and were given a &quot;covenant ring&quot; to wear on their right hands. A document entitled &quot;Protocols &amp; Requirements Between Spiritual Father &amp; His Spiritual Sons&quot; contains the oath:

The document asserts Tamaki&#x27;s authority as &quot;Bishop&quot; and &quot;spiritual father&quot; of the church he founded. Another section, &quot;Conduct Towards Bishop&quot;, states that &quot;Bishop is the tangible expression of God&quot;, instructs the &quot;sons&quot; to follow numerous protocols, to defer to Tamaki with unquestioning loyalty and obedience, to follow his dress code, and to never tolerate criticism.

==Public profile==
===Political activities===
Richard Lewis, a member of Destiny Church Auckland, formed the Destiny New Zealand political party in 2003. The party first ran candidates in 2005. Candidates from four different churches joined with candidates who came from Destiny Church. Despite Tamaki&#x27;s prediction that the church would rule New Zealand by 2008, the party&#x27;s 42 candidates gained only 0.6 percent of the vote. This fell well short of the five percent threshold required to enter Parliament without an electorate MP but proved the best performance of any party that failed to enter Parliament. In 2007, City Impact Church and Destiny Church collaborated in the establishment of the &quot;Family Party&quot;, but the latter won just 0.35% of the party vote in New Zealand&#x27;s 2008 general election and dissolved in 2010. Since the outbreak of the Israel–Hamas war on 7 October 2023, Destiny Church has expressed support for Israel and opposition to Hamas and Palestinian solidarity protesters. In November 2023, Tamaki organised pro-Israel counter-protests in Brisbane including an &quot;Anzacs&quot; rally where 200 Destiny supporters performed a haka and controversial Jewish activist Avi Yemini gave a speech. In December 2023 and March 2024, Destiny Church staged pro-Israel counter-protests in Wellington.

===Māori community===
Destiny Church recognises and celebrates Māori as tangata whenua (&quot;People of the Land&quot;). It also regards itself as an &quot;iwi-tapu&quot; or a spiritual tribe of God&#x27;s people set aside as a chosen people and a holy nation, citing a scriptural premise from 1 Peter 2:9. In 2008, Destiny Church sought to claim urban Māori status so that they could serve Māori congregants who were disconnected from their tribes. Māori broadcaster and urban Māori advocate Willie Jackson supported Destiny&#x27;s proposal by arguing that Tamaki and Destiny Church had changed the lives of thousands of former Māori criminals, fraudsters, and drug dealers for the better. Destiny&#x27;s socially conservative position on gay rights and women drew opposition from various sectors including Prime Minister Helen Clark. In October 2008, Destiny Church was awarded Urban Māori Authority status and Te Rūnanga a Iwi o Te Oranga Ake was incorporated to serve as the church&#x27;s service provider arm. In 2011, Destiny Church received funding from the Ministry of Social Development for four Community Max programmes to help 79 youths in Auckland, Waikato, and the Bay of Plenty transition into full-time employment. However, Destiny Church struggled to receive government funding for other projects including a charter school. As a result, the Church has had to fund its own community services programme including the &quot;Man Up&quot; programme to help men become better fathers, husbands, and leaders in their own families and communities.

===ManUp and legacy===
Caine and Jamie Warren, elders of Destiny Church, founded &quot;Man Up&quot; in 2015. It offers a programme developed by Bishop Brian and Pastor Hannah Tamaki. The programme claims success in reducing the over-representation of Maori men in every negative statistic in New Zealand and in restoring the &quot;mana&quot; of men who have lost their sense of identity and purpose. Anecdotal evidence tells of changed individuals. ManUp Director Caine Warren told TVNZ that all men are welcome. ManUp involves everyday men from all walks of life meeting in small groups once a week throughout a 15-week time-commitment. Alongside ManUp, Destiny Church offers similar groups and programmes developed to support, empower and encourage woman (Legacy) and youth (Boys2Men, Legacy Diamonds). In February 2019 Tamaki met with Minister of Justice Andrew Little to discuss giving Destiny Church&#x27;s Man Up programme permission to participate in prison rehabilitation. Tamaki has also sought access to government grants for rehabilitation programs and access to prisoners. In a media interview, Little stated that he did not anticipate Man Up indoctrinating more followers into the church, just as (for example) the Salvation Army and the Presbyterian Church do not. Tamaki clashed with the New Zealand Government in April 2019 over introducing Man Up into prisons, threatening &quot;inmate revolts in every prison&quot; and suggesting that ministers had subjected him to &quot;a political gang rape&quot;. Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis stated that no &quot;independent reputable evidence&quot; endorsed the Man Up programme and that Tamaki had not applied and gone &quot;through a process to get a programme into prisons&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Opposition to homosexuality===
Destiny Church and its leader Brian Tamaki have been known for their vocal opposition to homosexuality. On 23 August 2004, Destiny Church organised a large public rally known as the &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; march in Wellington to oppose the Fifth Labour Government&#x27;s proposed Civil Union Act. For the march, Destiny Church members wore black shirts emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Enough is Enough.&quot; The march generated considerable media and public attention with critics such as Labour MPs Georgina Beyer and David Benson-Pope likening the marchers to Nazis. Bishop Tamaki attracted controversy when he blamed the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes on sinful behaviour such as murder and homosexuality during a sermon on 13 November 2016. These statements preceded the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake by a few hours. Tamaki&#x27;s remarks were condemned by several leading New Zealand public figures including the Mayor of Christchurch Bob Parker, Prime Minister John Key, and the Anglican bishop of Dunedin, Kelvin Wright. One Auckland-based critic Aaron Smithson also organised a Change.org petition calling for the revocation of Destiny Church&#x27;s tax-free status. On Saturday 1 June 2019, Bishop Brian Tamaki formally apologised to all homosexual people for his conduct in the past. The event where this apology took place was at the Stand conference in Destiny Church Auckland. He invited his good friend Jevan Goulter who spoke on the matters as well as influential homosexual figures. Brian stated that all homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender people were welcome to his church.

===Political and religious views===
On his website &quot;New Zealand: A Nation Under Siege&quot; (bishoptamaki.org.nz) Tamaki declared the government of New Zealand to be &quot;inherently evil&quot;, pointing out that some members of Parliament chose not to swear on the Bible, and one (Ashraf Choudhary) swore on the Qur&#x27;an, when being sworn into government. In a June 2005 interview, Tamaki said Destiny was ready to wage war on &quot;secular humanism, liberalism, relativism, pluralism&quot;, on &quot;a Government gone evil&quot;, on the &quot;modern-day witchcraft&quot; of the media, and on the &quot;radical homosexual agenda&quot;. Destiny Church&#x27;s far-right ideology has been described as authoritarian.

===Tithing===
Tithing is common practice in Destiny Church. Media articles using former Destiny Church members as sources have alleged that Tamaki has an outspoken autocratic style and highlighted the church&#x27;s frequent appeals for tithe contributions, and its insular culture. &quot;The Sunday Star Times&quot; highlighted Tamaki&#x27;s visible wealth and personal luxury, questioning its consistency with the church&#x27;s tithing system. Church pastors agree to a restraint of trade that applies in the event that they withdraw as pastors. In March 2010, the church&#x27;s Brisbane pastor resigned over a difference in doctrine. Twenty five members of the congregation followed him out of the church; some expressed their support for him to the media, saying that the church was a money-making cult. On 29 August 2017, Destiny Church co-founder and senior pastor Hannah Tamaki attracted media attention for purchasing a new Mercedes-Benz AMG GLE63 S SUV worth NZ$207,900. This coincided with reports that the Charities Services was considering stripping three of Destiny Church&#x27;s charities of their charitable status for failing to file returns. Some critics have regarded these expenses as extravagant luxuries that come at the expense of church members.

===Cult allegations===
Following members taking a voluntary covenant pledge to Bishop Brian and the cause of Destiny Church, the church was labelled as a cult by several New Zealand media outlets and other observers. In an interview with TVNZ, Mark Vrankovich of Cultwatch criticised the covenant, saying Mr Tamaki was &quot;taking a kingship position&quot;, and
In the same interview following the reports of October 2009, Bishop Tamaki and Richard Lewis defended the pledge on the basis that it was taken willingly, and simply attempted to set standards and codify established practice within the church. Lewis denied the &quot;cult&quot; claims, noting that church services are open to the public. Tamaki denied the existence of a &quot;cult of personality&quot;, saying that he was simply setting a visible example for men to follow; and that the church helps a lot of people from difficult backgrounds. &quot;Campbell Live&quot;, a current affairs program, made use of a covert camera and an unidentified witness to critique church practices and the Momentum conference. The church later issued a response, stating that &quot;a number of comments made by the individual were grossly inaccurate&quot;, that the source was not credible, and the report reflected &quot;poor practice&quot;. In a separate report Peter Lineham, associate professor at Massey University, expressed similar concerns but stopped short of using the word &#x27;cult&#x27;:
Cult allegations resurfaced in 2010, when Cultwatch accused Tamaki of denying the bodily resurrection of Jesus, the claims and Tamaki&#x27;s denial of the cult status generated substantial media coverage.

===Sexual abuse allegations===
In late March 2010, controversy arose over allegations against two adult children of Destiny Church Taranaki Pastors Robyn and Lee Edmonds. Charges were withdrawn by Police as there was no evidence. The pastors resigned from Destiny Church Taranaki leadership. Fourteen years later in May 2024, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that a former Destiny Church youth group leader was the subject of a sexual abuse allegation involving a male teenager in November 2023. After the teenager&#x27;s mother alerted the Police, Destiny Church suspended the youth leader from his volunteer leadership role and banned him from the church. Destiny Church also removed several teenagers who were living with the man. The teenager&#x27;s family had joined Destiny Church in 2018 and subsequently joined the youth group. The boy&#x27;s mother alleged that her son suffered post-traumatic stress disorder following the abuse, manifesting in violent, volatile and suicidal behaviour. The mother also said that Destiny Church had held meetings with her son and the man&#x27;s other alleged abuse victims, without contacting the parents or seeking their permission. She also criticised Police and Destiny Church for their alleged inaction in investigating the former youth leader&#x27;s alleged sexual abuses. The &quot;Herald&quot; also reported that the former youth leader was now involved with a new South Auckland church group. In response, Tamaki expressed sympathy for the alleged victims and their families, and said that he &quot;hopes police investigate the matter quickly.&quot; Tamaki also criticised the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; for exposing the story, describing the report as &quot;another hit-piece &amp; gutter reporting.&quot; Police confirmed that they were investigating historical sex abuse allegations involving a Counties Manukau youth group and said there were multiple alleged victims with the alleged offending spanning several years. In early June 2024, Police had arrested and charged a 29 year old man with six charges of indecent assault against two individuals. Police confirmed that the man was a former Destiny Church disciple involved with a South Auckland youth group. By late August 2024, Police confirmed that the suspect was facing a total of 17 charges of indecent asault and one charge of unlawful sexual connection involving five individuals connected to the South Auckland youth group. Detective Inspector Natalie Nelson said that the historical sexual allegations dated back to at least 2020. Destiny Church issued a statement that the matter was now in the hands of the Police and the courts.

===Revocation of tax-exempt status===
Allegedly more than 100,000 people had signed a petition calling for the New Zealand Government to revoke Destiny Church&#x27;s tax-free status, reports say that this petition was in response to Tamaki&#x27;s remarks blaming gays for the 2010 and 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, and church co-founder Hannah Tamaki&#x27;s purchase of a brand new Mercedes-Benz in mid-August 2017. In early October 2017, the Department of Internal Affairs issued notice to remove two of Destiny Church&#x27;s biggest charities, Destiny International Trust and Te Hahi o Nga Matamua Holdings, of their charitable status. Destiny Church took immediate legal action and subsequently to date they still retain their charitable status with the Department of Internal Affairs. In late October 2019, the High Court restored the charitable status of Destiny International Trust and Te Hāhi o Ngā Mātāmua Holdings. Destiny&#x27;s lawyer Ron Mansfield confirmed that the two charities were complying with the law. In February 2022, the Department of Internal Affairs delisted four Destiny-link charities for failing to file their annual returns by 31 December 2021.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Destiny Church courted media attention when Bishop Tamaki announced that his movement would not close their churches in response to Government directives discouraging large gatherings of more than 100 people. In a statement on 15 March 2020, Tamaki stated that &quot;I&#x27;m not about to let a filthy virus scare us out of having church. To equate fear with common sense is nonsense.&quot; Tamaki&#x27;s stance was criticized by infectious diseases expert Dr Siouxsie Wiles, who remarked that &quot;people like [Tamaki], former politicians, entrepreneurs are all coming out and saying all sorts of nonsense, rather than being supportive of how we&#x27;re going to get through this... Instead of [Tamaki] saying &#x27;how can we help keep New Zealanders safe&#x27;, he&#x27;s just stating stuff when he actually does not know anything.&quot; While Destiny Church held services on 22 March, it took precautionary steps including encouraging the sick and elderly to stay at home, having health checks, and separated 19 rooms into eight zones to manage crowd numbers. As of 28 March, Destiny Church has discontinued physical services but shifted to livestreaming sermons on its website, Facebook Live, and YouTube. In mid–2020, Tamaki announced that Destiny Church would be holding services despite the Government&#x27;s alert level two restrictions limiting private gatherings including religious services to 10 people. Tamaki described the Government as &quot;controlling parents&quot; and called on churches to join him in opposing these restrictions as a breach of rights. In early October 2021, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Destiny Church had received a total of NZ$127,903.20 in wage subsidies including $91,384.80 for its 13 employees in Auckland and $36,518.40 for six in Hamilton. On 2 October, Bishop Tamaki had organised an anti-lockdown protest, which attracted 2,000 people including families with young babies. Tamaki was subsequently charged with breaching the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 and the Alert Level 3 Order. In early November 2021, Destiny Church admitted that it played a central role in leading the anti-lockdown group The Freedoms &amp; Rights Coalition (TFRC), which had organised nationwide anti-lockdown protests, but denied making money from the Coalition&#x27;s merchandise. According to Stuff, the TFRC&#x27;s web domain was owned by Jenny Marshall, the church&#x27;s director of operations and Brian Tamaki&#x27;s assistant. The Coalition&#x27;s website solicited donations and sold merchandise including t-shirts, flags and facemasks emblazoned with anti-lockdown messaging. Marshall also confirmed that Brian Tamaki regarded himself as the &quot;founder and architect&quot; of the movement but claimed that the Coalition&#x27;s merchandising was separate from Destiny Church&#x27;s finances. In addition, Stuff reported that Brian and Hannah Tamaki maintained links with Groundswell NZ&#x27;s Pukekohe and Auckland coordinator Scott Bright, who donated vegetables to the TFRC and participated in an anti-lockdown protest in his personal capacity. In late November 2021, Radio New Zealand reported that Destiny Church had leased its carpark in Wiri, Auckland for the Whānau Ora Community Clinic&#x27;s testing operations. The Whānau Ora clinic, which has vaccinated tens of thousands of people at its Takanini mass vaccination centre, is owned by two prominent Destiny Church members Raewyn Bhana and George Ngatai.

===Opposition to drag queen storytime readings===
Destiny Church has opposed to Drag Queen Story Hour events in New Zealand. On 19 March 2024, the church objected to a proposed drag queen event at Rotorua&#x27;s library by drag performers Sunita Torrance (Coco) and Daniel Lockett (Erika Flash), threatening to protest if the event proceeded. The Rotorua Lakes Council cancelled the storytime event, citing safety concerns about misinformation and violence. On 26 March 2024, members of the local Destiny Church in Gisborne painted over a rainbow crossing to protest against Erika and Coco Flash&#x27;s drag queen event at the town&#x27;s library. Later that day, Destiny Church members protested the reading outside the Gisborne library, where they were met by LGBT counter-protesters. Mayor of Gisborne Rehette Stoltz condemned the vandalism of the rainbow crossing, which was subsequently repainted by the Gisborne District Council. Police later arrested five individuals who attempted to vandalize the rainbow crossing a second time. Police charged two men and a woman with graffiti vandalism in connection to the Gisborne rainbow crossing incident. 

Following the Gisborne protest, an upcoming Erika and CoCo Flash Rainbow Story event in Hastings was cancelled by the Hastings District Council due to safety concerns. In response to Destiny Church&#x27;s actions, the Labour Party&#x27;s rainbow spokesperson Shanan Halbert described the church&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;very disappointing.&quot; While Halbert supported the right to protest, he condemned what he regarded as &quot;vicious discrimination against young people and their families.&quot; On 15 April 2024, Ford O&#x27;Connor, a member of Destiny Church who is married to Tamaki&#x27;s granddaughter, pleaded guilty to vandalizing the Karangahape Road rainbow crossing in central Auckland on 28 March. O&#x27;Connor was fined $16,093 to cover the repair costs for the crossing. During the sentencing, Tamaki expressed support for O&#x27;Connor, saying that &quot;he undertook a political protest against the excessive rainbow-washing that is occurring across New Zealand right now, at the expense of our taxpayers and our ratepayers.&quot; 

In late April 2024, Rainbow Storytime NZ&#x27;s founder Sunita Torrance cancelled a future nationwide tour to focus on a defamation case against Destiny Church. By contrast, Tamaki welcomed the cancellation of the drag queen storytime tour as a victory on social media. In late June 2024, Torrance and fellow drag performer Daniel Lockett filed a lawsuit against the leadership of Destiny Church for allegedly inducing breach of contract, conspiracy to injure, unlawful means conspiracy, and defamation in relation to the disruption of their drag story events. In response, Destiny Church said it would continue to advocate for children&#x27;s well-being and accused the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; of promoting crowdfunding for the drag performers&#x27; legal case.

On 15 February 2025, members of Destiny Church&#x27;s Man Up and Legacy groups disrupted a drag performer&#x27;s show at Te Atatū&#x27;s library, which was attended by 30 adults and young children. Radio New Zealand reported that parents and children were intimidated by the Destiny members&#x27; protest actions. The church members&#x27; actions were condemned by Prime Minister Luxon, Mayor of Auckland Wayne Brown, Acting Waitematā District Commander Inspector Simon Walker, Labour leader Chris Hipkins and Te Atatū MP Phil Twyford. On 17 February, the Police launched an investigation into assault complaints related to the Te Atatū library protest. Twyford also called for the Charities Services to strip Destiny Church of its charitable status. On 21 February, a Niu FM radio host was dismissed by his employers due to his involvement in the Te Atatū Library protest.

===Opposition to transgender rights===
In early May 2024, Tamaki opposed the use of puberty blockers on transgender children and youth undergoing transitioning and the appointment of Dr Sue Bagshaw as the Government&#x27;s lead investigator on the review of the suitability of puberty blockers in New Zealand. On 6 May, he and Pastor Derek Tait led a protest by Destiny Church members against Te Tahi Youth health service in Christchurch, which helps transgender people access healthcare. Destiny supporters were met by counter-protesters while Police monitored the event.

<text>A Hangover You Don&#x27;t Deserve is the fifth studio album by American rock band Bowling for Soup. It was released on September 14, 2004, as their third album with Jive Records. The first single, &quot;1985&quot;, quickly became a Top 40 staple, peaking at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Top 40 chart.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s name came from lead guitarist Chris Burney, who was also the name inspiration for the band&#x27;s previous effort, &quot;Drunk Enough to Dance&quot;.

&quot;Almost&quot; was meant to be the first single off the album. However, the band would receive a call from Butch Walker&#x27;s manager, who suggested the band cover the SR-71 song &quot;1985&quot;. Upon hearing the song, Reddick felt the subject matter didn&#x27;t meet the band&#x27;s criteria, so he asked SR-71 frontman Mitch Allan if he could make changes to the song, to which Allan said yes.

==Critical reception==

Johnny Loftus, writing for AllMusic, praised the catchability of the first three tracks and Jaret Reddick&#x27;s songwriting on songs like &quot;Ohio (Come Back to Texas)&quot;, but was critical of the album containing typical pop punk production (&quot;stuff like piano breaks, compressed vocals, and steppe farm chorus guitars&quot;) that made the band sound too close to similar bands like Goldfinger and Lit, saying that &quot;most of the time it&#x27;s very hard to hear Bowling for Soup around &quot;Hangover&quot;″s radio and video-ready sheen.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Brian Hiatt felt that tracks like &quot;1985&quot; were not enough to sustain a whole album, saying that, &quot;Like a lower-SATs version of Fountains of Wayne, the Texas quartet tries to write silly/clever lyrics to go atop their high-carb pop melodies. But too much of the humor (rhyming &quot;Miss Texas&quot; with &quot;bigger breast-es&quot;?) functions on a Jackass: The Band level.&quot;

==Track listing==
Each version of the album, excluding the DualDisc version, has a number of tracks that are four to five seconds of complete silence, titled &quot;[Blank]&quot;, between the last song and &quot;Ohio (Reprise)&quot;. The number of tracks varies upon the version, but &quot;Ohio (Reprise)&quot; and &quot;Belgium (Boy Band Remix)&quot; are tracks 43 and 44 respectively on all versions.

<text>Disney Springs is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, near Orlando. 

First opened in 1975 as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village, it has been expanded and rebranded over the years as Walt Disney World Village (1977), Disney Village Marketplace (1989), and Downtown Disney (1997), becoming Disney Springs in 2015. A similar complex is being developed on the opposite side of Walt Disney World called Flamingo Crossings.

The complex includes four distinct areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side. Buses and water taxis operated by Disney Transport provide transportation between Disney Springs and other areas of Walt Disney World.

==History==

===Early expansion; multiple rebrandings===

The Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village, which opened on March 22, 1975, was originally envisioned as an area shopping mall. Two years after its opening, the complex was renamed Walt Disney World Village. With the advent of new management under Michael Eisner in 1984, Disney began looking for ways to keep vacationers on Walt Disney World property longer, and prevent them from leaving for entertainment beyond Disney&#x27;s borders.

To compete with the popular Church Street Station clubs in downtown Orlando, Disney announced the addition of Pleasure Island, featuring nightclubs showcasing Disney&#x27;s quality and creativity, to Walt Disney World Village on July 21, 1986. Construction began the following August and Pleasure Island was opened on May 1, 1989, the same day as the Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios theme park. Later that year, the complex was renamed Disney Village Marketplace.

In the mid-1990s, the growth of Walt Disney World created the potential for further expansion, leading to a $1 billion investment in projects across the resort. The first World of Disney store opened October 2, 1996, in Marketplace.

On June 20, 1995, a major enhancements and expansions were announced for the area, with the Disney Village Marketplace and Pleasure Island being combined into a newly branded district named Downtown Disney. The re-branding was introduced on September 7, 1997. On September 15, Downtown Disney West Side, a expansion, opened as a third shopping, dining, and entertainment area featuring venues such as La Nouba (the former Cirque Du Soleil show in residence which closed at the end of 2017), DisneyQuest, and Virgin Megastore. Major changes to the complex also included the conversion of Mickey&#x27;s Character Shop into the World of Disney, becoming the world&#x27;s largest Disney store, in addition to the expansion and upgrade of the AMC Pleasure Island Theatres, as well as the opening of Rainforest Cafe and Planet Hollywood. On September 27, 2008, the Pleasure Island nightclubs closed.

The Downtown Disney Mall Complex gained a sister district in California on January 12, 2001, with the addition of Downtown Disney at the Disneyland Resort. Similar complexes also exist at other Disney resorts: Disney Village, which opened on April 12, 1992, at Disneyland Paris; Ikspiari, which opened on July 7, 2000, at the Tokyo Disney Resort; and Disneytown at Shanghai Disney Resort.

===Renovation, expansion, and renaming===
On March 14, 2013, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts chairman Tom Staggs announced that Downtown Disney would be redesigned and renamed as Disney Springs. The 3-year renovation and expansion project would include 150 new tenants, two parking structures, and a near-doubling of mall area. Prior to this announcement, the last renovation of Downtown Disney had been in 1997.

In order to facilitate the construction of the area and the increase in capacity, two large parking structures were constructed in previous surface parking lot areas. New construction features include new bridges connecting the complex to Disney&#x27;s Saratoga Springs resort, with further bridges connecting The Landing to the Marketplace, The Springs, Town Center and West Side. &quot;High Line&quot; structures were built across the West Side in order to provide both theme and shade. In addition, a new bus terminal, with dedicated bus lanes on Buena Vista Drive, was built; Buena Vista Drive was widened, and a new exit ramp built from Interstate 4 directly to Disney Springs, as part of the traffic upgrade. The complex was renamed Disney Springs on September 29, 2015. Town Center, built just south of The Landing in the surface parking lots, was opened on May 15, 2016, completing the major construction on the project. A third parking garage began construction in 2017 across Buena Vista Drive and opened as Grapefruit Garage on April 16, 2019.

On March 17, 2020, Disney Springs closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Florida. On May 7, 2020, it was announced that Disney Springs would begin a phased reopening on May 20.

On May 24, 2024, a nighttime drone show, Dreams That Soar, began running nightly at Disney Springs, which ran until September 2, 2024. The show was revealed with several other highlights at the Walt Disney World Resort. Disney World had also hosted a five-minute drone show titled Starbright Holidays for the 2016 holiday season.

==Areas==
Disney Springs is divided into four areas: Marketplace, The Landing, Town Center, and West Side. The complex is bordered by Lake Buena Vista to the north and the parking garages and surface lots to the south. Walt Disney Imagineering took inspiration for Disney Springs from real coastal towns found throughout Florida, such as St. Augustine and Coral Gables.

Creative director Dave Hoffman said about the area, &quot;Each neighborhood reflects its function and [the fictional] time period when it was developed.&quot; According to the town&#x27;s fictional history, Disney Springs was settled in the mid-1800s by a cattle rancher who discovered the town&#x27;s namesake springs and the town subsequently expanded from the springs outwards.

===Marketplace===
The Marketplace houses many shops and restaurants reminiscent of the American Craftsman-style of the 1930s. The first restaurant in the Earl of Sandwich chain is located here. T-Rex Cafe is a dinosaur-themed restaurant operated by Landry&#x27;s Restaurants, which features animatronic dinosaurs. It opened on October 14, 2008. Landry&#x27;s Restaurants also operates Rainforest Cafe at this location. A walkway spanning the Village Lake and connecting Rainforest Cafe with the Lego Store—The Marketplace Causeway—was constructed and opened in 2015.

===The Landing===
The Landing depicts the fictional town&#x27;s transportation hub and marina. The Landing features nautical-themed restaurants and shops, including Jock Lindsey&#x27;s Hangar Bar—an aviation-themed dive bar based on the character from the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films—and The Boathouse, which serves as the port for the amphibious automobiles that offer cruises of Lake Buena Vista. The Amphicar is the amphibious vehicle used for the cruises. The area is also home to the Raglan Road Irish Pub and Restaurant.

The Landing was in the site of Pleasure Island, a nighttime entertainment district with two comedy clubs and four dance clubs. These areas closed permanently on September 27, 2008. On November 18, 2010, Disney announced a project named Hyperion Wharf, which was planned to replace the Pleasure Island complex. Pleasure Island would have undergone extensive renovations and re-theming to transform into the early twentieth century wharf-themed entertainment area. New shopping and dining locations would have also been added. In July 2011, it was announced that these plans were delayed. The plans were later canceled because it was deemed better to totally overhaul the Downtown Disney area. With the advent of Disney Springs, the former Pleasure Island was redesigned as The Landing in 2015.

====The &quot;Empress Lilly&quot;====

The structure originally known as the &quot;Empress Lilly&quot; is a static full-size replica of a paddle steamer riverboat on Village Lake. It is 220 feet long and 62 feet wide. Though it resembles a paddle steamer boat, it is actually a boat-shaped building on a submerged concrete foundation.

It opened on May 1, 1977, when it was christened by Walt Disney&#x27;s widow, Lillian Disney, for whom it was named. It originally housed four separate entertainment and dining areas. In the mid-1990s, Levy Restaurants signed a contract to operate the &quot;ship&quot; for 20 years. On April 22, 1995, the &quot;Empress Lilly&quot; closed. The interior was remodeled and the old smokestacks and paddlewheel were removed due to rust and rot. The restaurant opened as Fulton&#x27;s Crab House on March 10, 1996. Fulton&#x27;s Crab House closed for major renovations in 2016 to be remodeled into a new restaurant, Paddlefish. As part of the transformation, the ship received new smokestacks and a new paddlewheel.

===Town Center===
Town Center depicts the fictional town&#x27;s central business district, featuring Spanish Revival architecture from the 1920s. The Town Center area also features the namesake &quot;springs&quot;, which are artificial.

The area debuted in 2016, having been built on former surface parking lots, and features many well known retailers. The area will open in multiple phases, with the first phase having opened on May 15, 2017. Retailers to have opened in the first phase of Town Center include Anthropologie, Uniqlo (the first of its kind in the Southeastern United States), Sephora, L&#x27;Occitane en Provence, Pandora, UGG, Johnston &amp; Murphy, ZARA and Kate Spade and Trophy Room among many others.

===West Side===

West Side depicts the town&#x27;s exposition center, having been developed in the 1950s, according to the town&#x27;s fictional history.

The expansion of the existing &quot;AMC Theatres Pleasure Island 24&quot; venue opened with Downtown Disney West Side in 1997. Renovations began in late 2010, which created theaters offering enhanced food service. The complex was renamed AMC Downtown Disney 24. In 1997, there were plans to open a Planet Movies by AMC entertainment complex at this location by combining the Planet Hollywood restaurant with a re-branded AMC megaplex. These plans were abandoned due to Planet Hollywood&#x27;s continued financial problems. The complex has now been renamed AMC Disney Springs 24. DisneyQuest was located in this area until it closed on July 2, 2017, and was subsequently demolished. The NBA Experience, which was built on the DisneyQuest site, briefly operated for 7 months from August 12, 2019, through March 2020 due to closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 16, 2021, it was confirmed that the location would never reopen, since it was announced that the attraction was permanently closed. On February 19, 2025, it was reported that Level99, an escape room attraction, would replace the NBA Experience.

== Transportation ==

There are 3 parking garages at Disney Springs: the Orange Garage, the Lime Garage, and the Grapefruit Garage. There are also 4 surface parking lots: the Lemon Parking Lot, the Mango Parking Lot, the Strawberry Parking Lot, and the Watermelon Parking Lot. A direct exit exists from westbound Interstate 4 to Disney Springs which is directly connected to the Orange Garage. Parking is free although valet parking is available for a fee of $20. 

Disney Springs is served by Disney Transport buses which serve all Disney resort hotels. There is no direct bus service from Disney Springs to Disney parks. However, direct bus service to Disney Parks is available from the Congress Park bus stop at Saratoga Springs (located near Rainforest Cafe in Disney Springs) and bus service is available from Disney Springs to the Contemporary Resort (near Magic Kingdom) and the Boardwalk, Beach Club and Yacht Club resorts (near Epcot and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios). Ferry service is provided within Disney Springs and from Disney Springs to the Saratoga Springs, Old Key West, and Port Orleans resorts. 

Disney Springs is also served by Lynx bus routes 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 306 and 312 which depart from the bus terminal on the west side of Disney Springs adjacent to the Watermelon Parking Lot. A Brightline train station was planned to be built near Disney Springs which would have provided service to Tampa, Orlando Airport, and Miami, however, on June 28, 2022, Disney announced that the station would not be built nor would the train run on the Walt Disney World park property.

<text>Downtown Disney (officially the Downtown Disney District) is a lifestyle center located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, United States. It opened on January 12, 2001; a component of the Disneyland Resort expansion project alongside the Disney California Adventure theme park and Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa.

==Location and history==
Downtown Disney connects the two Disneyland Resort theme parks with its three resort hotels, running from the western side of the property&#x27;s Esplanade to the Disneyland Hotel. West Street, which bordered Disneyland&#x27;s western side, was rechristened Disneyland Drive and lowered to accommodate a pedestrian bridge that connects much of Downtown Disney to the Disneyland Hotel and Pixar Place Hotel. A Disneyland Monorail System station sits adjacent to the pedestrian bridge.

The area has featured several shops and restaurants, ranging from popular retail brands to many Disney-operated shops including a World of Disney store running beneath much of the Grand California Hotel.

Downtown Disney has featured as many as 30 shops, but there have been changes due to announcements in late 2017. In July 2019, parking for Downtown Disney was relocated to south of Disney&#x27;s Paradise Pier Hotel (known today as Pixar Place Hotel) at the Simba parking lot. In addition, a pedestrian bridge linking the Pixar Pals and Mickey and Friends parking structures to the shopping district was opened on September 13, 2019.

=== Canceled Fourth Hotel and subsequent activities ===
In 2017, plans were announced for a fourth resort hotel at the property. Situated in front of the Disneyland Hotel, the new hotel would displace much of the westernmost portion of Downtown Disney and would have featured 700 rooms. The cost of construction for the hotel would have been offset by up to $267 million in tax rebates over 20 years, allowing the resort to keep a percentage of the transient occupancy tax levied on Anaheim hotels.

In Summer of 2018, several large Downtown Disney tenants closed in preparation for the new hotel&#x27;s construction – an AMC Theatres cinema, Rainforest Cafe and ESPN Zone restaurants, and smaller tenants including Earl of Sandwich and a Starbucks location.

Weeks after the closures took place, growing tensions between Disney and the City of Anaheim over the subsidy and the hotel&#x27;s location led to the project being put on hold. Days after the announcement that the project was postponed, Disneyland requested that the tax subsidies be rescinded. The Anaheim City Council voted to rescind the tax subsidies days later.

After weeks of inactivity at the hotel&#x27;s proposed site, Disney announced in October 2018 that the fourth hotel project had been canceled. In October 2018, Earl of Sandwich and Starbucks reopened. After several years of vacancy, Disney announced that the former Rainforest Café location would become &quot;Star Wars&quot; Trading Post, a retail location selling &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge merchandise, which opened on February 19, 2021. Today, the former ESPN Zone building remains vacant.

On March 14, 2020, the Disneyland Resort, including Downtown Disney, temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Downtown Disney remained closed until July 9, 2020. The district reopened with enhanced safety measures, including mandatory face masks, reduced capacity and temperature screening upon arrival. These measures were lifted on June 15, 2021, following California&#x27;s reopening.
From November 19, 2020, to March 14, 2021, the resort expanded the district temporarily into Buena Vista Street at Disney California Adventure.

In November 2021, Disney announced a reimagining of the West Side of Downtown Disney with new shopping, dining, and entertainment experiences. Construction began with the demolishing of AMC Theatres, Starbucks, and Earl of Sandwich beginning in January 2022. On April 27, 2022, Din Tai Fung was announced to be the anchor for the expansion. The announcement also came with a reimagining of UVA Bar and Catal into separate restaurants named Centrico and Paseo, as well as a mid-century modern design for the district&#x27;s new west end. In addition, Porto&#x27;s Bakery is scheduled to open in 2025.

<text>The Triumph TR4 is a sports car produced by the Triumph Motor Company from 1961 to 1965. Successor to the TR3A, the TR4&#x27;s chassis and drivetrain are closely related to those of its predecessor, but with an updated body designed by Michelotti.

== Development ==
Triumph began planning a successor to the TR3 as early as 1956. At the time, the company was facing a number of challenges. Lack of capital to fund development was partly relieved by the sale of Triumph&#x27;s tractor division to Massey-Harris of Canada. A long overdue refresh of their small sedans was further complicated by the departure of chief stylist Walter Belgrove over a disagreement with the direction of the redesign.

After being introduced to Giovanni Michelotti, Triumph managing director Alick Dick invited the Italian designer to produce a concept car for the British company. Michelotti responded with the Triumph TR3 Speciale, also called the &quot;TR Dream Car&quot;.

Built by Vignale on an unmodified TR3 chassis, Michelotti&#x27;s TR Dream Car incorporated many styling cues from contemporary American practice, including tailfins, a full width grille, lidded headlamps in the tops of the front wings, and a two-tone paint treatment. The TR3 Speciale debuted at the Geneva International Motor Show in March 1957. Triumph deemed the car too expensive to put into production, but did give the job of designing the new Triumph Herald to Michelotti.

Later in 1957 Standard-Triumph commissioned Michelotti to develop a serious proposal for a revised TR. A prototype, code-named &quot;Zest&quot; and built on a TR3A chassis, was complete by 1958. The &quot;Zest&quot; received a full-width body style, with headlamps that were inset from the sides and set high in the grille to stand above the bonnet, which was shaped into cowls over the lamps.

Around this time Triumph&#x27;s Competitions department was working on a new high performance engine with the development label &quot;20X&quot;, later named Sabrina after contemporary British actress Norma Ann Sykes, the 20X is an inline four cylinder engine with dual overhead camshafts, and was expected to develop . To accommodate the engine, a chassis was created that widened the track by four inches and extended the wheelbase by six inches over those of the TR3.

In late 1958 Triumph commissioned Michelotti to create a body for the 20X development chassis. The new shape, named &quot;Zoom&quot;, was a full-width body, with tall doors having wind-down windows, and headlamps moved to the tops of the front wings. Two prototypes were complete by 1959; one convertible and one coupé with a removable roof panel.

The &quot;Zoom&quot; body was used for the three Triumph TRS race cars fielded at the 1960 24 Hours of Le Mans, which were powered by three 20X DOHC engines. The cars staged a formation finish, but were unclassified due to having failed to cover their mandatory distance. The cars were revised and entered again in the 1961 race, where they finished ninth, eleventh, and fifteenth overall, and claimed the manufacturer&#x27;s team prize for Triumph.

By the middle of 1960, Triumph had two potential TR replacements — &quot;Zest&quot; and &quot;Zoom&quot; — with a combined program cost of £676,000. Originally, &quot;Zest&quot; had been conceived as the TR3&#x27;s replacement, while &quot;Zoom&quot; was considered for production as an upmarket model. Having seen &quot;Zoom&quot;, some at Triumph wanted it to become the next TR, but the cost to produce a detuned 20X engine killed the project.

Ultimately management decided that neither &quot;Zest&quot; nor &quot;Zoom&quot; adequately addressed the target market, so the final design for the TR4 was based on &quot;Zest&quot;, but included some features from &quot;Zoom&quot;, including the wider track and hardtop option.

==Features==
===Body and chassis===
The TR4&#x27;s new body, produced in Triumph&#x27;s Speke factory, does away with the cutaway door design and sloping boot lid of the previous TRs. The taller doors allow room for wind-down windows in place of the previous side-curtains, making the TR4 a true convertible. The taller, more squared-off rear body line encloses a capacious boot for a sports car.

The car&#x27;s bonnet has a power bulge or &quot;bubble&quot; offset to one side to clear the engine&#x27;s two carburettors. Early cars have a short bubble, while cars after CT 6429 have a longer bubble.
The TR4 offered an optional hard top consisting of a fixed glass backlight with integral rollbar and a detachable centre panel made of aluminium on the first 500 units, and steel on subsequent cars. Featured on one of the &quot;Zoom&quot; prototypes, this was the first such roof system on a production car, predating the Porsche 911/912 Targa by five years.

On the TR4 the rigid roof panel could be replaced with a vinyl insert and supporting frame. While the rigid panel could not be stowed in the car, the vinyl insert and frame could be. The factory offered the rigid top and backlight assembly as the &quot;Hard Top kit&quot;, and the vinyl insert and frame separately as the &quot;Surrey top&quot;.
The revised interior introduced adjustable fascia ventilation and a collapsible steering column. Features such as these were seen as necessary to keep pace with the competition, particularly in the important US market where the majority of TR4s were sold.

The TR4 uses essentially the same ladder chassis with central cruciform bracing as the TR3. At , the TR4 has the same wheelbase as the earlier car, but its track widths are wider in front and wider in back than the earlier model.

===Powertrain===

The TR4 uses the same Standard wet liner inline-four engine that powered the TR2 and TR3 models, but with displacement increased from 1991 cc to 2138 cc by enlarging the bore from . The cast iron block carries the crankshaft in three main bearings, and the cast iron head has two valves per cylinder driven from a camshaft in the block via pushrods and rocker arms. The 1991 cc engine was a no-cost option for cars whose owners planned to race in the under-two-litre classes of the day. At different times the factory installed either a pair of SU H6 carburettors, or a pair of Zenith-Stromberg CD175s.

The car&#x27;s four speed plus reverse manual transmission has synchromesh on all forward gears, an upgrade from the transmission in the TR3 which did not synchronize first gear. Additionally, the optional Laycock de Normanville electrically operated overdrive could be selected for second, third, and fourth gears, effectively providing the TR4 with a seven-speed close ratio gearbox.

===Running gear===
The TR4&#x27;s front suspension consists of upper and lower wishbones, and telescopic dampers. Running changes to the car included a revised front suspension geometry, indicated by a smooth upper wishbone, and a revised front brake caliper and pad size.

The rear suspension includes a live axle with semi-elliptical springs, and lever-arm dampers.

The TR4 is fitted with rack and pinion steering, replacing the cam and lever system used on the earlier TR models.

The TR4 was originally fitted with 15x4.5&quot; disc wheels. Optional 48-lace wire wheels could be ordered with one of three finishes: painted the same colour as the car&#x27;s bodywork (rare), stove-enamelled (matte silver with chrome spinners, most common) or in matte or polished chrome finishes (originally rare, but now more common). Originally, the tyres most commonly fitted were 590-15 bias ply or optional radial tyres. At one point, American Racing alloy (magnesium and aluminium) wheels were offered in the US as an option, in 15x5.5&quot; or 15x6&quot; size.

==Production and sales==

The first production TR4 was built on 18 July 1961, and received commission number CT1. The last car was built on 6 January 1965, with commission number CT40304. Final assembly of the cars was done at Triumph&#x27;s Canley-Fletchamstead factory near Coventry. TR4s were also assembled from Complete Knock-Down (CKD) kits in Mechelen, Belgium and Borgo Panigale, Italy, the latter in a factory owned by Ducati.

American Triumph dealers were concerned that buyers might not accept the car&#x27;s updated styling, so a brief special run of TR3s, commonly called TR3Bs, was produced for the US market in 1961 and &#x27;62. These cars have the body and chassis of the TR3A, but the 2138 cc engine and fully synchronised gearbox from the TR4.

A small number of TR4s were put to use as &quot;Fast Pursuit Cars&quot; by police departments in places such as Manchester City and the Southend-on-Sea Borough.

Only 40,253 TR4s were built during its 5-year production run, of which 37,661 cars were sold in export markets (primarily the US), and only 2,592 cars sold domestically. In comparison, 8,635 TR2s were sold during its 3-year run from 1953–1955; 74,800 TR3s in an 8-year run from 1955 to 1962; 94,500 TR6s in an 9-year run from 1968–1976, and 111,500 TR7s over a 7-year run from 1975–1981.

As of Q2 2022 there were approximately 953 licensed and 216 SORN TR4s registered with the DVLA.

The TR4 had a number of racing successes in America, primarily through the efforts of Californian engineer Kas Kastner and his top driver, Bob Tullius.

In 1961 the TR4 with commission number CT 7L, driven by George Waltman and Nick Cone, won first in class and thirtieth overall at Sebring. In 1962 the TR4 won the E production national championship, after which the SCCA reclassified the car to D production, which class Tullius won in 1963 and &#x27;64. Soon after the TR4 was introduced, Kastner and with Mike Cook from the advertising department at Triumph in New York City convinced the company to provide three new TR4s to race in the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1963. Preparation of the cars began in September 1962 in California, where Kastner was service supervisor for Triumph. The cars were then flown to Florida for the endurance race in March 1963. Driven by Mike Rothschild and Peter Bolton from England, Bob Tullius, Charlie Gates, Ed Deihl, Bob Cole, Bruce Kellner and Jim Spencer, the cars finished 22nd, 24th, and 35th overall of 65 entries, and first, second, and fourth in the 2.5 GT class. This was the genesis of the Triumph Competition Department led by Kastner for several years and used to publicize and market the TR4. The next year a privateer TR4 finished dead last in the 1964 running of the Sebring 12-hour race. Kastner returned to Sebring in 1966 with four carefully prepared TR4As, three of which finished winning the class. At Sebring in 1966, Tullius threw a piston in the most highly tuned car and did not finish. Perhaps the greatest racing victory for the TR4A was at Daytona, where a Kastner-prepared car driven by Charlie Gates won the 1965 SCCA D modified championship against Ferraris and other prepared race car exotica.

In 1964 the factory-sponsored Team Triumph entered three TR4s in the Canadian Shell 4000 rally. These &quot;works&quot; cars were reportedly built with gussets on the chassis members and aluminium body panels to strengthen and lighten the car. After import, the engines were prepared by Kastner in New York, where they were also fitted with lightweight magnesium wheels. Although they did not place well in the rally, the surviving cars have become quite valuable, one of which is owned by Neil Revington, the proprietor of Revington TR in the UK. Indeed, the TR4 became a celebrated rally car in Europe and the UK during early to mid-sixties, and various replicas are still campaigned by privateers in vintage rally events throughout Europe.

The TR4 continues to be raced in vintage sports car events, and even won an SCCA class championship as late as 1991. In Australia the TR4 was a common sight at hill-climb events and various club rallies and circuit racing events.

==TR4A==

In 1965, the TR4A superseded the TR4. Although appearing nearly identical to the TR4, the TR4A was equipped with a significantly revised chassis, an independent rear suspension (IRS), and a wider front and rear track, as well as numerous changes to the exterior trim and interior fitments. An estimated 25% of TR4As sold in the US were not equipped with IRS but instead reverted to a live axle system similar to the TR4&#x27;s on a slightly modified TR4A chassis.

==Dové GTR4==
A total of 43 Dové GTR4 and GTR4A fixed head coupés were produced at the direction of L. F. Dove Ltd., an auto dealership in Wimbledon, London. The conversions from standard TR4s were done by coachbuilder Harrington Motor Bodyworks, best known for building the Harrington Alpine, a similarly converted Sunbeam Alpine. Conceived as a more weather-proof alternative to the drophead coupé TR4, the Dové provided a way for Dove Ltd. to enter the market for GT automobiles. The company substituted an accented vowel at the end of the Dové name, although it is not typically pronounced.

The cars came with a heater in the engine&#x27;s water jackets to assist cold starts. Tinted swing-down see-through acrylic sun visors were custom fitted. Two jump seats were located behind the driver&#x27;s and passenger&#x27;s seats, covered in material that matched the original TR4 upholstery. A wood-rimmed wheel with riveted perimeter was fitted to some models, along with auxiliary lamps under the front bumper bars. A metallised identifying sticker with &quot;Dové&quot; on it was fitted to the glovebox cover. On the left rear deck below the boot cover was another identifying badge with the Dové logo. The side window glasses were specially shaped, with a flat top edge to fit the new roof line. Some were fitted with a fully balanced motor built by either Jack Brabham Motors or Laystall Engineering in London, which was offered as an option in the sales catalogue. Each Dové was an individual order, with some variations between each car. The cars were priced at an expensive £1250. Although most Dovés were based on the TR4 model, some brochures include pictures of a TR4A-based version.

The aerodynamics of the Dové gave it good acceleration from in comparison with the TR4 drophead coupé. One example was exported for sale through Australian Motor Industries in Melbourne, Australia. A road test of one of these cars was reported in &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine dated 7 June 1963, and in &quot;Autosport magazine on 12 July 1963. Up to a dozen of the cars are known to still exist.

<text>The Shanghai Art Museum () was an art museum in the city of Shanghai, China. In October 2012, the museum was rebranded as the China Art Museum when it moved to the China pavilion at Expo 2010 on the former Shanghai Expo 2010 lands. The Shanghai Art Museum building is the former clubhouse building of the Shanghai Race Club. It sits on the western edge of People&#x27;s Park, north of People&#x27;s Square, which was once the Shanghai race course. The Shanghai Art Museum was the original home of the Shanghai Biennale, founded in 1996 by Fang Zengxian, then director of the museum. The former museum building is being converted to house the Shanghai History Museum, which had been left without a home due to redevelopment since 1999.

==History of the Shanghai Art Museum building==
The Shanghai Art Museum building is located on the south side of Nanjing Road (West). The building has an area of 2,200 sq m.

The building was constructed in 1933, as the clubhouse for the Shanghai Race Club race course. The horse race course was reputed to be the third most profitable industry during the 1930s (during the Republic of China era).

In 1955, the building was renovated and a terrace was constructed on the roof. The goal was mainly to enable the architects to build wider stairs leading to the clock tower, so that youth can easily visit the tower.

The building has one of the most prominent clock towers in the city after the Customs House clock tower on the Bund. The clock tower at the Art Museum has historically been associated with decay and corruption in the city, as it was often inaccurate. However, it was renovated in 2006 and has been accurate since then.

==Events==
Shanghai Art Museum was the home to the Shanghai Biennale, which started from 1996. The Shanghai Biennale is considered one of the most important cultural events in Shanghai. In 2012, the Shanghai Biennale moved to the new Power Station of Art.

<doc id="961216" wikidata="Q2206912" url="?curid=961216" title="Caning (furniture)">
<text>In the context of furniture, caning is a method of weaving chair seats and other furniture, either while building new chairs or in the process of cane chair repair.

Furniture or chair caning may be confused with wicker; chair caning is specifically the craft of applying rattan cane or rattan peel to a piece of furniture such as the backs or seats of chairs, whereas wicker or wicker work is a reference to the craft of weaving any number of materials such as willow or rattan reeds as well as man-made paper based cords.

==Rattan==

In common use, the term &quot;cane&quot; may refer to any plant with a long, thin stem. However, the cane used for furniture is derived from the rattan vine native to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The vines typically grow to in length; most have a diameter less than . Before export, the rattan stems are cut to uniform lengths and the bark is removed in narrow strips of .
Sugar cane and bamboo (sometimes called &quot;cane&quot; in the southern United States) should not be confused with rattan cane.

Rattan vine looks somewhat similar to bamboo but is quite different in that bamboo is hollow and holds itself upright while rattan is a solid flexible vine that needs the support of surrounding structure to elevate itself off the forest floor. It climbs to the top of canopies of the forest to reach sunlight with the help of large rugged thorns that grab hold of surrounding trees. Sometimes much of the length of these rugged vines are draped along the forest floor from tree to tree in search of a suitable structure to climb.

<doc id="961217" wikidata="Q13720" url="?curid=961217" title="Messier 32">
<text>Messier 32 (also known as M32 and NGC 221) is a dwarf &quot;early-type&quot; galaxy about from the Solar System, appearing in the constellation Andromeda. M32 is a satellite galaxy of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and was discovered by Guillaume Le Gentil in 1749.

The galaxy is a prototype of the relatively rare compact elliptical (cE) class. Half the stars concentrate within inner core with an effective radius of . Densities in the central stellar cusp increase steeply, exceeding 3×107 (that is, 30 million) pc−3 (that is, per parsec cubed) at the smallest sub-radii resolved by Hubble Space Telescope, and the half-light radius of this central star cluster is around . Like more ordinary elliptical galaxies, M32 contains mostly old faint red and yellow stars with practically no dust or gas and consequently no current star formation. It does, however, show hints of star formation in the relatively recent past.

==Origins==

The structure and stellar content of M32 are difficult to explain by traditional galaxy formation models.
Theoretical arguments
and some simulations suggest a scenario in which the strong tidal field of M31 can transform a spiral galaxy or a lenticular galaxy into a compact elliptical. As a small disk galaxy falls into the central parts of M31, much of its outer layers will be stripped away. The central bulge of the small galaxy is much less affected and retains its morphology. Gravitational tidal effects may also drive gas inward and trigger a star burst in the core of the small galaxy, resulting in the high density of M32 observed today.
There is evidence that M32 has a faint outer disk, 
and as such is not a typical elliptical galaxy.

Newer simulations find that an off-centre impact by M32
around 800 million years ago explains the present-day warp in M31&#x27;s disk.
However this feature only occurs during the first orbital passage, whereas it takes many orbits for tides to transform a normal dwarf into M32.
The observed colours and stellar populations of M32&#x27;s outskirts do not match the stellar halo of M31,
indicating that tidal losses from M32 are not their source.
Taken together, these circumstances may suggest that M32 already began in its compact state, and has retained most of its own stars.
At least one similar cE galaxy has been discovered in isolation, without any massive companion to thresh it.

Another hypothesis is that M32 is in fact the largest remnant of a former spiral galaxy, M32p, which was then the third largest member of the Local Group. According to this simulation, M31 (Andromeda) and M32p merged about two billion years ago, which could explain both the unusual makeup of the current M31 stellar halo, and the structure and content of M32.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41550-018-0533-x&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distance measurements==
At least two techniques have been used to measure distances to M32. The infrared surface brightness fluctuations distance measurement technique estimates distances to spiral galaxies based on the graininess of the appearance of their bulges. The distance measured to M32 using this technique is 2.46 ± 0.09 million light-years (755 ± 28 kpc). However, M32 is close enough that the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method may be used to estimate its distance. The estimated distance to M32 using this technique is 2.51 ± 0.13 million light-years (770 ± 40 kpc).
For several additional reasons, M32 is thought to be in the foreground of M31, rather than behind.
Its stars and planetary nebulae do not appear obscured or reddened by foreground gas or dust.
Gravitational microlensing of M31 by a star in M32 was observed at the end of November 2000 in one event (with peak on 2 December 2000).

==Black hole==

M32 contains a supermassive black hole.
Its mass has been estimated to lie between 1.5 and 5 million solar masses.
A centrally located faint radio and X-ray source
(now named M32* in analogy to Sgr A*)
is attributed to gas accretion onto the black hole.

<text>Shezmu (alternatively Schesmu and Shesmu) is an ancient Egyptian deity with a contradictory character. He was worshiped from the early Old Kingdom period.

He was considered a god of ointments, perfume, and wine. In this role, he was associated with festivities, dancing, and singing. But he was also considered a god of blood, who could slaughter and dismember other deities. It is thought possible that the ancient Egyptians used red wine to symbolize blood in religious offerings, explaining why Shesmu is associated with both blood and wine.

Shesmu was seldom depicted but when he was he appeared as a man with a lion&#x27;s head holding a butcher&#x27;s knife. In later times he appeared as a lion. If only his name was mentioned it often appeared with the determinative of an oil press, and sometimes only the oilpress was depicted. he was also depicted as a man with the head of a vulture holding butcher knives

== Worship ==
Shesmu was a god with a contradictory personality. On one hand, he was &quot;lord of perfume&quot;, &quot;maker of all precious oil&quot;, &quot;lord of the oil press&quot;, &quot;lord of ointments&quot; and &quot;lord of wine&quot;. He was a celebration deity, like the goddess Meret. Old Kingdom texts mention a special feast celebrated for Shesmu: young men would press grapes with their feet and then dance and sing for Shesmu.

On the other hand, Shesmu was very vindictive and bloodthirsty. He was also &quot;lord of blood&quot;, &quot;great slaughterer of the gods&quot;, and &quot;he who dismembers bodies&quot;. In Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts, several prayers ask Shesmu to dismember and cook certain deities in an attempt to give the food to a deceased king. The deceased king needed the divine powers to survive the dangerous journey to the stars.

However, the interpretation remains open if the word &quot;blood&quot; is to be taken literally, as the ancient Egyptians symbolically offered red wine as &quot;the blood of the gods&quot; to several deities. This association was based simply on the dark red color of the wine, a circumstance that lead to connections of Shesmu with other deities who could appear in red colors. Examples include deities such as Ra, Horus, and Kherty. The violent character of Shesmu made him a protector among the companions of Ra&#x27;s nocturnal barque. Shesmu protected Ra by threatening the demons and brawling with them. In the Pyramid Texts, he does similar things.

It appears that starting in the New Kingdom, Shesmu&#x27;s negative attributes became gradually overshadowed by the positive ones, although on a 21st Dynasty papyri his wine press appears to be filled with human heads in place of grapes (a depiction which was common earlier, on Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts). Then later, on the 26th Dynasty sarcophagus of the Divine Adoratrice Ankhnesneferibre, Shesmu is recorded as a fine oil maker for the god Ra. And even later, during the Greco-Roman period, the manufacture of the finest oils and perfumes for the gods became Shesmu&#x27;s primary role.
== Cult ==
Shesmu&#x27;s main cult center was located at the Fayum. Later, there were further shrines erected at Edfu and Dendera.

<text>TransUnion LLC is an American consumer credit reporting agency. TransUnion collects and aggregates information on over one billion individual consumers in over thirty countries including &quot;200 million files profiling nearly every credit-active consumer in the United States&quot;. Its customers include over 65,000 businesses. Based in Chicago, Illinois, TransUnion&#x27;s 2014 revenue was US$1.3 billion. It is the smallest of the three largest credit agencies, along with Experian and Equifax (known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;).

TransUnion also markets credit reports and other credit and fraud-protection products directly to consumers. Like all credit reporting agencies, the company is required by U.S. law to provide consumers with one free credit report every year.
Additionally a growing segment of TransUnion&#x27;s business is its business offerings that use advanced big data, particularly its deep AI-TLOxp product.

==History==
TransUnion was originally formed in 1968 as a holding company for Union Tank Car Company, making TransUnion a descendant of Standard Oil through Union Tank Car Company. The following year, it acquired the Credit Bureau of Cook County, which possessed and maintained 3.6 million credit accounts. In 1981, a Chicago-based holding company, The Marmon Group, acquired TransUnion for approximately $688 million.

In 2010, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Advent International acquired it from Madison Dearborn Partners. In 2014, TransUnion acquired Hank Asher&#x27;s data company TLO. On June 25, 2015, TransUnion became a publicly traded company for the first time, trading under the symbol TRU.

TransUnion eventually began to offer products and services for both businesses and consumers. For businesses, TransUnion updated its traditional credit score offering to include trended data that helps predict consumer repayment and debt behavior. This product, referred to as CreditVision, launched in October 2013.

Its SmartMove™ service facilitates credit and background checks for landlords. The service also provides credit and background checks for partner companies, such as RentSpree. 

In September 2013, the company acquired eScan Data Systems of Austin, Texas, to provide post-service eligibility determination support to hospitals and healthcare systems. The technology was integrated into TransUnion&#x27;s ClearIQ platform, which tracks patients demographic and insurance related information to support benefit verification.

In November 2013, TransUnion acquired TLO LLC, a company that leverages data in support of its investigative and risk management tools. Its TLOxp technology aggregates data sets and uses a proprietary algorithm to uncover relationships between data. TLOxp also allows licensed investigators and law enforcement professionals to access personally identifiable information from credit header data.

In 2014, a TransUnion analysis found that reporting rental payment information to credit bureaus can positively affect credit scores. As a result, TransUnion initiated a service called ResidentCredit, making it easy for property owners to report data about their tenants on a monthly basis. These reports include the amount each tenant pays, the timeliness of their last payment, and any remaining balance the tenant currently owes. As a result, some companies have started reporting rent payment information to TransUnion.

In 2015, TransUnion acquired Trustev, a digital verification company specializing in online fraud for $21 million, minus debts.

In 2017, TransUnion acquired FactorTrust, a consumer reporting agency specializing in alternative credit data.

In mid-April 2018, TransUnion announced it intended to buy UK-based CallCredit Information Group for $1.4 billion, subject to regulatory approval.

In December 2021, TransUnion completed the acquisitions of Neustar, initially announced in September 2021 for $3.1 billion, and Sontiq which included IdentityForce, initially announced in October 2021 for $638 million.

In February 2023, TransUnion announced it was rebranding its &quot;thousands of existing B2B products into seven business lines.&quot; These include: TruAudience, TruValidate, TruContact (all based on former offerings from Neustar), TruVision, TruIQ, TruEmpower, and TruLookup.

In January 2025, TransUnion has been observed in buying a majority stake in its Mexican arm in a deal worth around $560 million. TransUnion&#x27;s stake in Trans Union de Mexico is said to be shot up around 94%, from a current 26%. 

==Legal and regulatory issues==

In 2003, Judy Thomas of Klamath Falls, Oregon, was awarded $5.3 million in a successful lawsuit against TransUnion. The award was made on the grounds that it took her six years to get TransUnion to remove incorrect information in her credit report.

In 2006, after spending two years trying to correct erroneous credit information that resulted from being a victim of identity theft, a fraud victim named Sloan filed suit against all three of the US&#x27;s largest credit agencies. TransUnion and Experian settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. In Sloan v. Equifax, a jury awarded Sloan $351,000. &quot;She wrote letters. She called them. They saw the problem. They just didn&#x27;t fix it,&quot; said her attorney, A. Hugo Blankingship III.

TransUnion has also been criticized for concealing charges. Many users complained of not being aware of a $17.95/month charge for holding a TransUnion account.

In March 2015, following a settlement with the New York Attorney-General, TransUnion, along with other credit reporting companies, Experian and Equifax, agreed to help consumers with errors and red flags on credit reports. Under the new settlement, credit-reporting firms are required to use trained employees to respond when a consumer flags a mistake on their file. These employees are responsible for communicating with the lender and resolving the dispute.

In January 2017, TransUnion was fined $5.5 million and ordered to pay $17.6 million in restitution, along with Equifax, by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The federal agency fined the companies &quot;for deceiving consumers about the usefulness and actual cost of credit scores they sold to consumers&quot;. The CFPB also said the companies &quot;lured consumers into costly recurring payments for credit-related products with false promises&quot;. Credit bureaus had the most complaints of all companies filed with the CFPB by consumers in 2018, with 34% of all complaints directed at TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian that year.

In June 2017, a California jury ruled against TransUnion with a $60 million verdict in the largest Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) verdict in history.
The San Francisco federal court jury awarded $60 million in damages to consumers who were falsely reported on a government list of terrorists and other security threats. The plaintiffs&#x27; team of attorneys at Francis &amp; Mailman, P.C. partnered with another California-based firm in the class action.
Following up on this, in April 2022, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said TransUnion is &quot;incapable of operating its businesses lawfully&quot;.

==Security issues==
On 13 October 2017, the website for TransUnion&#x27;s Central American division was reported to have been redirecting visitors to websites that attempted drive-by downloads of malware disguised as Adobe Flash updates. The attack had been performed by hijacking third-party analytics JavaScript from Digital River brand FireClick.

On 17 March 2022, TransUnion South Africa disclosed that hackers breached one of their servers and allegedly stole data of 54 million customers, demanding a ransom to not release it, the group N4ughtysecTU claims responsibility.

<text>In music, unified field is the &#x27;unity of musical space&#x27; created by the free use of melodic material as harmonic material and vice versa.

The technique is most associated with the twelve-tone technique, created by its &#x27;total thematicism&#x27; where a tone-row (melody) generates all (harmonic) material. It was also used by Alexander Scriabin, though from a diametrically opposed direction, created by his use of extremely slow harmonic rhythm which eventually led to his use of unordered pitch-class sets, usually hexachords (of six pitches) as harmony from which melody may also be created.

It may also be observed in Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s Russian period, such as in &quot;Les Noces&quot;, derived from his use of folk melodies as generating material and influenced by shorter pieces by Claude Debussy, such as &quot;Voiles&quot;, and Modest Mussorgsky. In Béla Bartók&#x27;s Bagatelles, and several of Alfredo Casella&#x27;s &quot;Nine Piano Pieces&quot; such as No. 4 &#x27;In Modo Burlesco&#x27; the close intervallic relationship between motive and chord creates or justifies the great harmonic dissonance.

<text>Roger William Byrne (8 September 1929 – 6 February 1958) was an English footballer who played as a full-back and captain of Manchester United. He died at the age of 28 in the Munich air disaster. He was one of the eight Manchester United players who lost their lives in the disaster on 6 February 1958. He made 33 appearances for the England national team.

==Biography==

Byrne was born on 8 September 1929 in the Gorton district of Manchester, the only child of William Henry Byrne (1894–1972) and Jessie Byrne (1899–1986). Byrne undertook two years of National Service in the Royal Air Force, where he was not considered good enough to play football and played rugby instead. While playing for Ryder Brow, Byrne came to the attention of United scout Joe Armstrong and was offered amateur terms at the club, turning professional soon after, becoming the first of what would come to be known as the Busby Babes.

Byrne was captain of Manchester United from the 1955–56 season onwards. He captained the side through the legendary Busby Babes era, playing as a left-sided full-back of the traditional style. He had previously been fielded at wing half and outside left and it was a testament to his versatility that, despite being naturally right sided, he should have been a success in a variety of positions.

Byrne was never considered the most gifted of footballers. His tackling could be suspect and his aerial ability was described as no better than average, but his incredible work ethic and footballing intelligence allowed him to position himself and react to danger swiftly. Innovatively, he was also adept at making forward runs and joining attacks at a time when full-backs were expected only to stand back and defend. Perhaps his best asset was his ability to inspire players with his charismatic leadership. Even more than 60 years after his death, he is still regarded as one of Manchester United&#x27;s greatest captains. He earned league-winner&#x27;s medals in 1952, 1956 and 1957, and was an FA Cup runner-up to Aston Villa in 1957. He also helped United reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1957, when they were the English Football League&#x27;s first entrants into the competition.

Byrne was also a regular member of Walter Winterbottom&#x27;s England team during the 1950s and was considered a possible captain of the national team after the retirement of the incumbent captain, Billy Wright, whose career continued until 1959. His total of 33 England caps were all won in consecutive fixtures. He appeared in every England international from his debut against Scotland in April 1954 to his last match against France in November 1957. This remains a record. Byrne never scored a goal for England; he took two penalties during his England career, but both were missed against Brazil and Yugoslavia in 1956.

He died in the Munich air disaster at the age of 28. Byrne was the oldest of the eight players who perished at Munich. On arriving home he would have received the news that his wife Joy was expecting their first child. They had only married the previous year. He was also survived by both of his parents at that time. Byrne&#x27;s funeral service was held at Flixton parish church and his body was cremated.

He was in the side which ousted Red Star Belgrade in the quarter-finals of the European Cup.

Eight months after Byrne&#x27;s death (7 October 1958), Roger Jr. was born. During the late 1960s and early 1970s he was a ball boy at Old Trafford. Roger Jr. died of cancer in December 2011 at age 53. He was living in Swindon, Wiltshire, and had been working in a senior role for the local council. He was survived by his mother, Joy, who by this stage was well into her seventies.

Some years after his death, a street on a new housing development in Newton Heath near Manchester city centre was named after him – Roger Byrne Close. Other roads and paths on the estate include Tommy Taylor Close, Eddie Colman Close, Mark Jones Walk, Billy Whelan Walk and David Pegg Walk, as well as a housing complex called Duncan Edwards Court, all of which are named after other players who died at Munich.

A biography, &quot;Roger Byrne, Captain of the Busby Babes&quot;, written by Iain McCartney, was published on 2 December 2000. The 2011 television drama &quot;United&quot; centred on the successes of the Busby Babes and the decimation of the team in the Munich air disaster, wrongly named Mark Jones as the captain of the team, while Byrne was not mentioned as a member of the team.

<text>Mark Jones (15 June 1933 – 6 February 1958) was an English footballer and one of eight Manchester United players to lose their lives in the Munich air disaster. Jones was born in Wombwell, near Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire in 1933, the third of seven children born to miner Amos Jones (1894–1968) and his wife Lucy (1896–1957). He was the club&#x27;s first-choice centre-half for much of the 1950s and collected two League Championship winner&#x27;s medals.

==Career==

Jones signed for Manchester United as an apprentice on leaving school in 1948, and also worked an apprentice bricklayer for a while afterwards. He made his first two senior appearances for United in the 1950–51 season, aged 17, and by the time of United&#x27;s title glory in 1955–56 he was a regular first team player, although he often found himself out of the team in favour of Jackie Blanchflower (who was originally a wing-half or an inside-forward), having previously been understudy to the veteran Allenby Chilton. By the time United won the league title in 1956, he was a regular member of the first team, and collected another league title medal the following year.

He missed the 1957 FA Cup Final defeat to Aston Villa because of an eye injury, although he did collect a second successive league title medal that season and helped United reach the semi-finals of the European Cup. He played a total of 120 first team games for United (103 of them in the league), and scored once. He was selected in an England senior squad once, but did not take to the field. Many observers believe that he would have been capped by England had he not died at Munich. He came close to international action, having been selected on the substitutes&#x27; bench, but his hopes of a breakthrough were not helped by the fact that his career coincided with that of Billy Wright. He was seen by many observers as a likely successor to Wright in the centre of the England defence.

==Legacy==
Jones is buried in Wombwell near Barnsley, his birthplace. He had moved from there in the early 1950s after turning professional with Manchester United and moving to Flixton. For the last two years of his life he lived in Firswood, Stretford.

Jones was often nicknamed Dan Archer by his teammates, in reference to his pipe-smoking habit similar to that of the character in the radio serial &quot;The Archers&quot;.

He was portrayed in a 2011 BBC film, &quot;United&quot;, by actor Thomas Howes. The producers mistakenly cast him as the team captain, when in fact Roger Byrne was captain of the United side at the time.

<text>Edward Colman (1 November 1936 – 6 February 1958) was an English football player who played as an wing-half and one of the eight Manchester United players who died in the Munich air disaster.

== Biography ==
Colman was born on Archie Street in Ordsall, Salford, Lancashire, the only child of plate player Richard Colman and his wife Elizabeth.

He joined Manchester United&#x27;s youth team on leaving school in the summer of 1952. He became a first-team member at right-half during the 1955–56 season, ousting Jeff Whitefoot to play alongside Duncan Edwards. He finished the season with a Football League First Division title medal. He collected another league championship medal the following season, and also helped United reach the European Cup semi-finals. He played in the FA Cup final that season, but only collected a runners-up medal as United lost 2–1 to Aston Villa.

He made 108 first-team appearances for United, scoring two goals, the second of which came in the first leg of the fateful European Cup quarter-final tie against Red Star Belgrade. He died on 6 February 1958 in the crash at Munich airport after the plane stopped to refuel on the return flight.

In his time at United, he was nicknamed &quot;Snakehips&quot; for his trademark body swerve.

Aged 21 years and 3 months, he was the youngest of the 23 people to die. An accommodation building at the University of Salford is named after him – the Eddie Colman Court is a block of flats located near the main campus.
A statue of Colman was erected at his graveside in Weaste Cemetery, Weaste, Salford, after his death, but it was badly damaged by vandals within a few years and after being repaired was placed in the home of his father Dick. Dick, who died in October 1986 at the age of 76, is buried alongside Eddie and Eddie&#x27;s mother Elizabeth, who died in November 1971 at the age of 62.

Twenty-seven workers at a Manchester boxmaking firm were dismissed from their jobs for leaving work to attend Colman&#x27;s funeral, but were all soon reinstated.

<text>Thomas Taylor (29 January 1932 – 6 February 1958) was an English footballer, who played as a centre-forward and was known for his aerial ability. He was one of the eight Manchester United players who died in the Munich air disaster.

==Career==

Taylor was born in Smithies, near Barnsley, Yorkshire, on 29 January 1932, one of six children born to Charles and Violet Taylor. He did not pass the eleven-plus and ended up as a pupil at Raley Secondary Modern School, leaving in 1947. He began his football career playing for a team at the colliery where he worked. Two years later, he signed for Barnsley. He made his first-team debut at the age of 18 on 7 October 1950, in a 3–1 home win against Grimsby Town. In his next match, on 4 November 1950, he scored a hat-trick in a 7–0 victory against Queens Park Rangers. In all he scored seven goals in twelve appearances in 1950–51. While playing for Barnsley, he carried out national service in the British Army. It would not be long before Taylor was attracting the interest of First Division clubs.

After scoring 26 goals in 44 games for Barnsley, who had been unable to progress beyond the Second Division, Taylor was transferred to defending First Division champions Manchester United in March 1953 for the unusual fee of £29,999. Matt Busby did not want to burden the 21-year-old Taylor as being a &quot;£30,000 player&quot;, so he took a £1 note from his wallet and handed it to the lady who had been serving tea during the negotiations. At the time, he was one of the most expensive players in British football and had also been subject of interest from clubs including Sheffield Wednesday, Derby County and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

He got off to a great start, scoring twice on his debut. By the end of the 1952–53 season, Taylor had scored seven goals in his first 11 games for United. He played a key role in United winning the First Division title 1955–56 and 1956–57 and scored in the 1957 FA Cup final, when United were denied the Double as they lost 2–1 to Aston Villa (winners of the competition for a then record seventh time). He also helped United reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in the 1956–57 season, when they were the Football League&#x27;s first entrants into Europe&#x27;s premier club competition.

Such was Taylor&#x27;s worth that Matt Busby decided to reject an offer of £65,000 for him from Internazionale in the summer of 1957. Had the deal gone through, it would have been one of the most expensive transfer fees in world football at the time.

At the time of his emergence, many saw Taylor as the perfect eventual replacement for Nat Lofthouse in the England side. In all, he played 19 times for England, scoring 16 goals. His first cap came on 17 May 1953 and a week later he found the net for the first time at senior international level in a 2–1 friendly win over Chile. He managed two hat-tricks for the England team, the first in a 5–2 win over Denmark on 5 December 1956, the second in a 5–1 win over Republic of Ireland on 8 May 1957. His last appearance for England came on 27 November 1957 against France, in which he scored twice in a 4–0 win.

Taylor died in the Munich air disaster, aged 26, on 6 February 1958. He had recently become engaged to his fiancée Carol.

He is buried at Monk Bretton Cemetery in his hometown Barnsley.

Taylor holds the all-time Manchester United league goal strike record of 0.67 goals per game.

On 8 July 2011, a blue plaque was unveiled at 22 Great Stone Road in Stretford. This was a boarding house in the 1950s and Manchester United used it as lodgings for their unmarried players – particularly the ones whose families did not live locally. Taylor lived there with players including David Pegg and Mark Jones until these players were killed at Munich, by which time Jones had already married and left the house. A number of players who survived the crash or who were not on the plane also lodged at this house. The landlady was Margaret Watson.

The plaque is sponsored by Stretford High School (which is only 50 yards away) and came about as a result of a local history project undertaken by the pupils at the school. The plaque was unveiled by the cricket umpire Dickie Bird, who was at school with Taylor in Barnsley.

<text>William Augustine Whelan (1 April 1935 – 6 February 1958), known as Billy Whelan or Liam Whelan, was an Irish footballer who played as an inside-forward. He died at the age of 22, as one of eight Manchester United players who were killed in the Munich air disaster.

Whelan was born in Dublin. He was one of seven children born to John and Elizabeth Whelan. His father John was an accomplished centre half-back for Dublin club Brunswick and was instrumental in winning the FAI Junior Shield in 1924. His mother was an avid Shamrock Rovers supporter. His father died in 1943 when Whelan was just eight years old. He was not a confident flyer and just before the aeroplane took off from Munich, he was heard to say: &quot;This may be death, but I&#x27;m ready.&quot;

He played Gaelic games, winning a medal for St Peter&#x27;s of Phibsboro. Dublin GAA club Naomh Fionnbarra successfully had a railway bridge situated near the place of Whelan&#x27;s birth renamed after him in 2006, while the Naomh Fionnbarra clubhouse also has Whelan&#x27;s Manchester United membership card.

==Club career==

Whelan began his career with Home Farm before joining Manchester United as an 18-year-old in 1953. He was capped four times for the Republic of Ireland national team (including a surprising 4–1 victory against Holland in Rotterdam in 1956) but did not score. His brother John played for Shamrock Rovers and Drumcondra and his eldest brother Christy played for Transport.

He made his first appearance for United during the 1954–55 season and quickly became a regular first-team player, and went on to make 98 first-team appearances in four seasons at United, scoring 52 goals. He was United&#x27;s top scorer in the 1956–57 season, scoring 26 goals in the First Division and 33 in all competitions as United won their second successive league title and reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. He also gave a commanding display in the 1957 FA Cup final despite losing 2–1 to Aston Villa. Such was the strength of the competition in the United first team that he was soon being kept out of the side by Bobby Charlton. He travelled with the United team to Belgrade for the fateful European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade, the day before the Munich air disaster, but did not play in the game.

==Legacy==
On 8 December 2006, the railway bridge on Fassaugh Road/Dowth Avenue junction in Cabra, Dublin 7, close to Dalymount Park was renamed in his honour. The campaign to have the bridge renamed was initiated and organised by members of the Cabra GAA club, Naomh Fionbarra and sanctioned by Dublin City Council in early 2006. It is close to St Attracta Road, the street in which he was born. The unveiling ceremony was performed by Whelan&#x27;s Manchester United teammate at the time of the air crash, Sir Bobby Charlton.

On 4 February 2008, the Irish national postal body An Post issued a 55c postage stamp for the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster showing a photo of Liam Whelan.

Whelan is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery.

<text>David Pegg (20 September 1935 – 6 February 1958) was an English footballer who played as an outside-left and one of the eight Manchester United players who died in the Munich air disaster on 6 February 1958.

== Career ==

He signed for United on leaving school in 1950 and made his first team debut in the Football League First Division against Middlesbrough on 6 December 1952, at the age of 17, and by the age of 20 he was a regular member of the first team. In 1956, at the age of 21, he collected a First Division title medal. The following season, he picked up another league title medal and also helped United reach the semi-finals of the European Cup, also collecting a runners-up medal in the FA Cup.

He was the club&#x27;s first-choice outside left until the final few months before the disaster (when he was displaced by Albert Scanlon) and had collected two League Championship winner&#x27;s medals in the two seasons leading up to the Munich air disaster. He also helped them reach the European Cup semi-finals twice. His performance against Real Madrid in the 1956-57 semi-finals reportedly inspired the Spanish giants to sign a new right-back specifically to combat Pegg&#x27;s talents in the future, although his death less than a year later meant that he never played against them again.

He was capped once for the England national football team, his solitary appearance coming in 1957, and was tipped by many to succeed Tom Finney, who was nearing the end of his international career, in the England team as England&#x27;s regular left winger.

== Legacy ==
Pegg&#x27;s sister, Irene Beevers, contributed to a 1998 ITV documentary, &quot;The Busby Babes: End of a Dream&quot;, which commemorated the 40th anniversary of the tragedy. She, Pegg&#x27;s brother and Pegg&#x27;s other sister, Doreen Robinson (who now lives in Australia) visited the scene of the Munich air crash in September 2005, on what would have been his 70th birthday, to pay tribute to their brother.

== Personal life ==
He was born in Highfields, a village located in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, in September 1935, one of three children born to miner William Pegg and his wife Jessie. His father also played amateur football to a high standard during the 1930s, winning a number of trophies with local football teams.

Aged 22 when he died, he was one of the youngest of the 23 who died at Munich. He was buried in the nearby Redhouse Cemetery. A memorial chair was dedicated in his memory at St. George&#x27;s Church in Highfields and when that church was closed the chair was moved to All Saints&#x27; Church in Woodlands which now serves both villages.

He was also outlived by both of his parents, though they have both since died; his father died in 1980 and his mother in 2006. They are both buried alongside him.

<doc id="961258" wikidata="Q2324566" url="?curid=961258" title="Geoff Bent">
<text>Geoffrey Bent (27 September 1932 – 6 February 1958) was an English footballer who played as a left back for Manchester United from 1948 until 1958. He was one of the Busby Babes, the young team formed under manager Matt Busby in the mid-1950s. Bent only made twelve first-team appearances for Manchester United, who already had an international-quality left back in Roger Byrne. Modern writers speculate that at most other teams Bent would have been a regular starter, and he was the subject of interest from fellow First Division clubs, but Busby refused to let him leave. He was one of eight Manchester United players who died in the Munich air disaster, when their aircraft crashed on its third attempt to take off from a slush-covered runway at Munich-Riem Airport after a European Cup match in Belgrade.
==Early life==
Geoffrey Bent was born on 27 September 1932 at Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height in Salford, Lancashire. He was the only child of Clifford Bent, a at Sandhole Colliery, and his wife Clara (née Dunning). He grew up in a matriarchal working-class family; his father was the sole money earner, but his mother ran the household and had more influence on her son. The family lived in a small house in Jackson&#x27;s Buildings, Salford, at the back of a shop; the only entrance was from a side alley, and the house had no indoor toilet. Bent received his education in Swinton; he first attended St John&#x27;s Junior School, and then was awarded a scholarship to Tootal Road Grammar School. He was a member of both the Boy Scouts and the Boys&#x27; Brigade, and a keen swimmer. In 1946, aged 13, Bent saved another child from drowning in the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal, and was awarded a medal by his local Humane Society.

Although Bent was encouraged to play rugby league by both his father, who supported the local Swinton club, and one of his teachers, he was only ever interested in playing association football. Bent began as a forward, playing at inside left, but later moved into the defence, first as a half back and then left back. He played for Barton Villa in local league football, and in the 1946–47 season, he captained the Salford Schoolboys team to victory in the English Schools Trophy, beating a Leicester team in the final. His performances for Salford drew the attention of several prominent clubs. Bent&#x27;s mother did not want him to leave home, and she swayed him to sign a contract with Manchester United. At the time, players were not allowed to sign a professional contract with a team until the age of 17, so like many of his teammates, Bent also took on an apprenticeship as a joiner, a trade he continued during the summer breaks between football seasons. After signing for Manchester United, a teenage Bent met Marion Mallandaine, initially when he had been dating her younger sister, Betty. His relationship with Betty did not last very long, and he married Marion on 27 June 1953 in Pendlebury, and the couple later moved into one of the football club&#x27;s houses on King&#x27;s Road, not far from the club&#x27;s home ground of Old Trafford.

==Manchester United career==
Bent initially joined Manchester United as a trialist in August 1948, then as an amateur alongside his apprenticeship in May 1949. Over the following few years, he played for United&#x27;s youth and reserve teams, where he excelled. Manchester United had a nucleus of young, upcoming players, so these teams were often very strong; Bent appeared alongside players such as Bobby Charlton, Wilf McGuinness, David Pegg and Duncan Edwards. In April 1951, aged 18, Bent signed a professional contract with the club.

Bent had been expected to replace John Aston Sr. at left back in the Manchester United first team; Aston was one of the older players in the team and injuries led to his retirement at the end of the 1953–54 season. Bent&#x27;s teammate Roger Byrne, who had deputised for Aston to make his Manchester United debut in 1951, had made it clear early in the 1952–53 season that he wanted to play at left back, requesting a transfer when the Manchester United manager Matt Busby played him on the left wing instead. Busby relented, and Byrne returned to left back. Byrne became Manchester United captain in February 1954, and it was clear that Bent would not be preferred for the position.

Bent made his first-team debut for Manchester United in December 1954 against Burnley, in place of Byrne, who had a neck injury. He appeared once more that season, when Byrne was on international duty for England in April. Bent&#x27;s appearances were again sporadic in the 1955–56 season, deputising for either Byrne or Bill Foulkes; he played three times in October, and then once in April. Modern commentators suggest that at almost any other First Division club, Bent would have been a regular member of the first team, and he twice requested a transfer. On both occasions, Busby turned down the request, explaining that he was too valuable for the club to lose. His wife, Marion, believed that several other First Division teams were interested in Bent, including Wolverhampton Wanderers, who along with Manchester United were one of the most successful English clubs of the 1950s. In 1956–57, Bent played six times, each time standing in for either Byrne or Foulkes.

Despite his infrequent first-team appearances, Bent was well thought of, both within the club, as evidenced by Busby&#x27;s refusal to sell him, and beyond. In an article published in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 1955, Byrne described the positive effect that having strong reserve players such as Bent, who he called a &quot;valuable prospect&quot;, had on the team, specifying that; &quot;I for one have really got to strive to keep my position&quot;. Foulkes later echoed claims that Bent would have been a first-team regular for most other clubs, and went on to describe him as being &quot;quiet and more studious&quot; than many of his teammates. Wilf McGuinness rated Bent as good enough to play at senior level for England. In his history of the victims of the Munich air disaster, Jeff Connor describes Bent as &quot;tall, well built and a strong tackler&quot;, and his biography in &quot;The Official Manchester United Illustrated Encyclopedia&quot; calls him a &quot;good tackler and accurate passer&quot;.

==Munich air disaster==

Bent did not play any first-team games during the 1957–58 season, having been on the sidelines for several months with a broken foot, the second such injury he had suffered during his time with the club. He was on crutches when visiting hospital in September 1957 for the birth of his daughter, Karen.

By February 1958, Bent was fully recovered, and had returned to action for the reserve team. He was not initially included in the travelling party for the second leg of the European Cup quarter-final against Red Star Belgrade. Bent did not enjoy flying, suffering from nose bleeds and requiring ear drops when he did so, and Ronnie Cope was going to travel with the team as a reserve for the experience of a European away fixture. In the days leading up to the trip, Byrne complained of an injury niggle, and so Busby called up Bent for the trip in case Byrne could not play. Bent complained to his wife about the trip, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why they&#x27;re taking me, because I&#x27;m sure Roger will be fit.&quot; Ultimately, Bent was proved right; Byrne recovered and played through the match which United drew 3–3. As they had won the first leg 2–1, United won the two-legged tie and progressed to the semi-finals.

Snow had been falling for most of the game in Belgrade, but the weather was better for the team&#x27;s flight home the next morning, 6 February. As the aircraft approached Munich-Riem Airport, the snow worsened once more. The plane landed safely, and the players disembarked while the plane was refuelled. A short time later, with the passengers back on board, the plane made two aborted attempts to take off, each time suffering from apparent engine problems. The passengers were asked to disembark again while the pilots discussed the issue with the ground crew, and fifteen minutes later they were ready to try again. On the third attempt, the plane reached , the plane&#x27;s takeoff decision speed, the speed above which take off can no longer safely be aborted, but then hit slush on the runway, and dropped speed. The plane failed to take off, and crashed off the end of the runway, through the barrier fencing, and across a road. Different parts of the plane hit a tree, a house and a wooden hut which exploded. Bent was one of 21 people who died at the scene —a death toll which included eight journalists and seven Manchester United players. Two more died from their injuries over the following few weeks, taking the total number of fatalities to twenty-three. Bent&#x27;s funeral and interment were held on 13 February at St John&#x27;s Church in Pendlebury.

==Legacy==
Although he was not a regular starter, Bent was considered to be one of the Busby Babes, the young team formed at Manchester United under manager Matt Busby in the 1950s which won the First Division in both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons. Bent&#x27;s name, along with the others who died in Munich, appears on a memorial plaque at Old Trafford, and there is also a memorial stone in Munich, near the site of the crash. The neglected state of his grave has been a regular press story; in 1988 the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; ran a story, in which Bent&#x27;s widow said she could not afford to maintain the grave. Similar stories appeared in 2005 and 2015; in each instance Manchester United said they would look to provide regular maintenance.

<text>Messier 18 or M18, also designated NGC 6613 and sometimes known as the Black Swan Cluster, is an open cluster of stars in the constellation Sagittarius. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764 and included in his list of comet-like objects. From the perspective of Earth, M18 is situated between the Omega Nebula (M17) and the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud (M24).

This is a sparse cluster with a linear diameter of 8.04 pc, a tidal radius of 7.3 pc, and is centrally concentrated with core radius of 0.012 pc. It has a Trumpler class of . The cluster is 33 million years old with an estimated mass of . It has one definite Be star and 29 B-type stars in total. There are three supergiant stars, all of class A or earlier. The brightest component (lucida), designated HD 168352, is a B-type giant star with a class of B2 III and a visual magnitude of 8.65.

Messier 18 is 1,296 kpc from the Earth and 6,830 kpc from the Galactic Center. It is orbiting the Milky Way core with a period of 186.5 million years and an eccentricity of 0.02. This carries it to as close as 6.5 kpc to, and as far as 6.8 kpc from the galactic core. It passes vertically through the galactic plane once every 27.4 million years, ranging no more than 80 pc above or below.

As of January 2022, Messier 18 is one of the few remaining objects within the Messier Catalog to not have been photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.

<doc id="961262" wikidata="Q2246080" url="?curid=961262" title="Matthias Koehl">
<text>Matthias Koehl Jr. (January 22, 1935 – October 9, 2014) was a U.S. Marine, neo-Nazi politician and writer. He succeeded George Lincoln Rockwell as the longest serving leader of the American Nazi Party, from 1967 to 2014.

Koehl was heavily influenced by the occultism of the Greek–French writer Savitri Devi and was also a close friend of the Dutch World War II Nazi collaborator Florentine Rost van Tonningen.

==Early life==
Born on January 22, 1935, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Hungarian immigrants of German descent, Koehl studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and played violin with the civic opera. A teenage antisemitic activist, Koehl worked with hate groups on the East Coast and the South before joining George Lincoln Rockwell&#x27;s American Nazi Party and the Marine Corps.

==Politics==
Koehl joined James Madole&#x27;s National Renaissance Party, the United White Party and the National States&#x27; Rights Party, where he first met George Lincoln Rockwell as they worked on the campaign of John G. Crommelin, before joining Rockwell’s American Nazi Party in 1960.

In 1953, he claimed to have met with the poet and fascist activist Ezra Pound during Pound&#x27;s imprisonment at St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, DC. In 1957, he became secretary-treasurer of the committee to Free Ezra Pound. Pound gave Koehl several signed volumes of his poetry during this period, signing them &quot;Matthias Koehl / HEIL / Ezra Pound / 1953&quot;.

In August 1967, formerly a deputy commander, Koehl succeeded the assassinated Rockwell as commander of the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party, known until December 1966 as the American Nazi Party. During Koehl’s leadership of the group he backed away from their attacks on other racial groups to instead focus on “positive” aspects of the Neo-Nazi ideology. In 1983, Koehl renamed the organization &quot;New Order&quot; and made it more overtly religious than political, espousing that Hitler had been sent down to Earth by a divine entity, reflecting his inspiration from Savitri Devi. Koehl did, however, still feature extremist anti-minority speech within the organisation; Urban Milwaukee pointed to a line on the website from 2007 saying that trusted supporters must &quot;be non-Jewish, white, and not a fugitive, drug addict or homosexual&quot;.

At the end of his life, Koehl was the leader of the World Union of National Socialists, despite his affiliation with Esoteric Nazism having alienated some members. He and the Order came under heavy financial troubles in the 1980s from both the IRS and the cost of living in Washington, D.C., which culminated in him dispersing the Order to Wisconsin and Michigan. Although he maintained a low public profile, Koehl granted an interview to the mainstream writer William H. Schmaltz in Arlington, Virginia, in April 1996 during the preparation of Schmaltz&#x27; biography of Rockwell.

==Death==
Koehl died in the night between October 9 and 10, 2014, at the age of 79 of complications related to cancer.

<text>Equifax Inc. is an American multinational consumer credit reporting agency headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and is one of the three largest consumer credit reporting agencies, along with Experian and TransUnion (together known as the &quot;Big Three&quot;). Equifax collects and aggregates information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide. In addition to credit and demographic data and services to business, Equifax sells credit monitoring and fraud prevention services directly to consumers.

Equifax operates or has investments in 24 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. With over 14,000 employees worldwide, Equifax has nearly US$5 billion in annual revenue and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol EFX.

==History==
Equifax was founded as the Retail Credit Company by Cator and Guy Woolford in Atlanta, Georgia, as Retail Credit Company in 1899. By 1920, the company had offices throughout the United States and Canada. By the 1960s, Retail Credit Company was one of the nation&#x27;s largest credit bureaus, holding files on millions of American and Canadian citizens. Even though the company continued to do credit reporting, the majority of its business was making reports to insurance companies when people applied for new insurance policies, such as life, auto, fire and medical insurance. RCC also investigated insurance claims and made employment reports when people were seeking new jobs. Most of the credit work was then being done by a subsidiary, Retailers Commercial Agency.

Retail Credit Company&#x27;s information holdings and willingness to sell its information attracted criticism in the 1960s and 1970s. These included that it collected &quot;...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors ... about virtually every phase of a person&#x27;s life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities.&quot; The company was also alleged to reward its employees for collecting derogatory information on consumers. This led to discrimination against queer people and people of color. 

In 1970, after the company had computerized its records, which led to wider availability of the personal information it held, the U.S. Congress held hearings that led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This legislation gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks. It is alleged that the hearings prompted the Retail Credit Company to change its name to Equifax in 1975 to improve its image.

Equifax expanded into commercial credit reports on companies in the United States, Canada and the UK, where it came into competition with companies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Experian. The insurance reporting was phased out. The company also had a division selling specialist credit information to the insurance industry but spun off this service, including the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) database as ChoicePoint in 1997. Equifax formerly offered digital certification services, which it sold to GeoTrust in September 2001. Also in 2001, Equifax spun off its payment services division, forming the publicly listed company Certegy, which subsequently acquired Fidelity National Information Services in 2006. Certegy effectively became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial as a result of this reverse acquisition merger &quot;(See Certegy and Fidelity National Information Services for further information)&quot;.

In October 2010, Equifax announced it was acquiring Anakam, an identity verification software company headquartered in San Diego, California, which invented and pioneered SMS (text-message based) two-factor authentication. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Equifax purchased eThority, a business intelligence (BI) company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina, in October 2011. eThority is partnering with TALX, a St. Louis-based business unit of Equifax, and remained in Charleston.

In February 2016, Equifax acquired the Australasian company Veda, the largest credit reference agency in Australia at the time. Veda had previously acquired the Australian market research and opinion polling company ReachTEL in September 2015, which continues to produce opinion polls in Australia.

Equifax was the subject of more than 57,000 consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from October 2012 to September 17, 2017, with most complaints relating to incomplete, inaccurate, outdated, or misattributed information held by the company.

In September 2017, Equifax announced a cyber-security breach, which it claims to have occurred between mid-May and July 2017, where cybercriminals accessed approximately 145.5 million U.S. Equifax consumers&#x27; personal data, including their full names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and driver license numbers. Equifax also confirmed at least 209,000 consumers&#x27; credit card credentials were taken in the attack. On March 1, 2018, Equifax announced that 2.4 million additional U.S. customers were affected by the breach, increasing the number of affected to 147.9 million Americans. The company claims to have discovered evidence of the cybercrime event on July 29, 2017. Residents in the United Kingdom (15.2 million) and Canada (about 19,000) were also impacted. The vulnerability which Chinese hackers leveraged was ; the hackers managed to stay in Equifax&#x27;s systems undetected for approximately 134days.

In March 2018, the Security and Exchange Commission accused Jun Ying, Equifax&#x27;s former CIO, of illicit insider trading, by selling company stock before the breach was publicly disclosed. After an investigation by the FBI, Ying pleaded guilty, was sentenced to four months of prison plus a year of supervised release, and was fined $55,000.00 and ordered to pay restitution of $117,117.61 in June 2019. An Equifax manager, Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, also pleaded guilty to insider trading and received a sentence of 8 months of home confinement.

In July 2019, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot; and other media reported Equifax had agreed to pay approximately $650 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to resolve investigations by several state attorneys general, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the FTC, and a consumer class-action lawsuit related to the data breach.

By September 2019, however, Equifax had added qualifications and &quot;hurdles&quot; to its claims process which put in doubt whether the previously announced cash settlement of $125 per affected consumer would actually be awarded.

On 19 December 2019, a federal judge in Atlanta awarded class-action attorneys representing consumers approximately $77.5 million, suggesting that individual consumers might expect to receive around six or seven dollars.

In July 2020, Equifax reported that, after purchasing Ansonia Credit Data (Ansonia), a major source of consumer credit, payments, and invoice receivables (AR) data used by financial companies and other borrowers and businesses in the shipping and logistics sectors, the firm has expanded its position in commercial payment technology solutions.

On 2 August 2022, a week after its CEO Mark Begor was deemed &quot;uniquely qualified to lead the Company&quot; and was granted a $25 million bonus package by Equifax&#x27;s board, the Wall Street Journal reported that Equifax had sent millions of incorrectly calculated credit scores to lenders. Equifax acknowledged reporting inaccurate credit scores, but insisted the errors had affected only a few people. The following day, a class-action lawsuit was filed by Jacksonville, Florida resident Nydia Jenkins against Equifax alleging she had received a &quot;substantially pricier car loan&quot; (resulting in an additional loan payment of $2,352 more per year) due to Equifax reporting her credit score 130 points off from what it should have been.

In February 2023, it was announced Equifax had acquired the Barueri-headquartered credit bureau, Boa Vista Serviços for $596 million, starting to trade on the B3 in São Paulo, under the symbol EFXB31.

==Products==
Equifax primarily operates in the business-to-business sector, selling consumer credit and insurance reports and related analytics to businesses in a range of industries. Business customers include retailers, insurance firms, healthcare providers, utilities, government agencies, as well as banks, credit unions, personal and specialty finance companies and other financial institutions. Equifax sells businesses credit reports, analytics, demographic data, and software. Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan. Credit grantors use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports containing financial and non-financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), an exchange of non-credit data including consumer payment history on telecommunications and utility accounts.

In 1999, Equifax began offering services to the credit consumer sector in addition, such as credit fraud and identity theft prevention products. Equifax and other credit monitoring agencies are required by law to provide US residents with one free credit file disclosure every 12 months; the Annualcreditreport.com website incorporates data from U.S. Equifax credit records.

Equifax also offers fraud prevention products based on device fingerprinting such as &quot;FraudIQ Authenticate Device.&quot;

Equifax also offers a credit protection service, called Equifax Protect.

== Security failings ==
According to senator Michael Crapo, &quot;The amount of data that the private industry and Government collect and store is very concerning. There is intrinsic vulnerability in collecting and storing personal financial information, and we need to have a meaningful discussion on how to protect and limit access to it.&quot;

=== 2016 advance-warnings of insecure systems ===
According to an October 2017 report from Motherboard, around December 2016, a security researcher examining Equifax&#x27;s servers found that an online portal, created for Equifax employees only, was accessible to the open Internet.

The same types of sensitive private information of American consumers (names, birth dates, social security numbers, etc.) were exposed as in the May–July breach, according to Motherboard. Additionally, the security researchers said they were able to gain shell access on Equifax&#x27;s servers and discovered and reported to Equifax additional vulnerabilities. According to the reporting, despite receiving this warning from the security researcher, the affected portal was not closed until six months later in June, well after the March and May–July breaches had begun. Moreover, the employee portal was reportedly not the same server targeted in the later breaches, which Motherboard speculates may suggest multiple breaches by more than one party may have occurred.

===March 2017 security breach===
On September 18, 2017, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that Equifax had been the victim of a &quot;major breach of its computer systems&quot; in March 2017, and that in early March it had begun &quot;notifying a small number of outsiders and banking customers&quot; about this attack.

According to Bloomberg, a person familiar with the breach believed this early-March intrusion may have been carried out by the same party that breached Equifax&#x27;s computer systems again in May. According to Bloomberg, Equifax enlisted Mandiant (owned by FireEye, Inc.) to assist in investigating the March attack. The same cybersecurity firm was hired following the May–July breach.

===May–July 2017 data breach===

Between May and July 2017, currently unidentified hackers were able to use a known exploit on one of Equifax&#x27; web servers that had yet to be updated to access the credit records of more than 140 million Americans as well as some British and Canadian citizens before the breach was detected and shut down. Equifax disclosed the breach on September 7, 2017, after determining the means and scope of the breach. The event was considered &quot;one of the biggest data breaches in history.&quot;

Several consumers filed lawsuits in small-claims court against Equifax due to the breach, while Equifax later came to a $575 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to offer either a cash payment or credit monitoring for those affected by the breach. The data from the breach has yet to be seen on black markets or the dark web by security experts, making it difficult to identify the origin of the breach. However, in February 2020, the United States Department of Justice indicted four members of China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army on nine charges related to the breach, which China has denied.

===2017 exposure of Argentine consumer data===
In September 2017, Brian Krebs revealed that the Argentine arm of Equifax had left private data from approximately 14,000 consumers, and more than 100 staff members, available to anyone who entered &quot;admin&quot; as both the username and password for one of its online systems.

===2017 withdrawal of vulnerable mobile apps===
On September 7, 2017, the same day as Equifax announced a large security breach, Equifax removed its official mobile apps from the Apple App Store and from Google Play. While these apps themselves were not reportedly connected to that breach, they had security flaws of their own, being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks owing to some parts using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

===2017 exposure of American salary data===
On October 8, 2017, Krebs reported that The Work Number, a website operated by Equifax&#x27;s TALX division, exposed the salary histories for employees of tens of thousands of US companies to anyone in possession of the employee&#x27;s Social Security Number and date of birth. For roughly half the US population, both of the latter pieces of data are known to be in possession of criminals, following Equifax&#x27;s May–July 2017 security breach. In July 2019, Equifax settled with the Federal Trade Commission for $700 million. This number contains a $380,500,000 consumer restitution fund, part of the class action lawsuit.

===Website malware===
On October 12, 2017, Equifax&#x27;s website was reported to have been offering visitors malware via drive-by download. The malware was disguised as an update for Adobe Flash. At that time, only 3 out of 65 top anti-malware products provided protection against the particular malware, meaning that many visitors were at risk of having their computers infected when visiting the Equifax website.

On October 13, 2017, the attack was revealed to have been performed by hijacking third-party analytics JavaScript from Digital River brand FireClick.

Also on October 13, 2017, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was reported to have suspended a $7.2 million contract with Equifax as a result of the attack.

==Criticism==
In 1982, Retail Credit Company was criticized for collecting &quot;...facts, statistics, inaccuracies and rumors... about virtually every phase of a person&#x27;s life; his marital troubles, jobs, school history, childhood, sex life, and political activities.&quot;
The company was charged with rewarding its employees for collecting negative information on consumers in the 1970s. There was a consent decree. In 1975 the company changed its name to &quot;Equifax&quot;—reportedly to counteract its tarnished reputation.

==Lawsuits and fines==
The company has been fined by the Federal Trade Commission on two occasions for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act (&quot;FCRA&quot;). In 2000, Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, was fined $2.5 million for blocking and delaying phone calls from consumers trying to get information about their credit. In 2003, the FTC took Equifax to court for the same reason and settled its lawsuit with the company for a fine of $250,000.

In July 2013, a federal jury in Oregon awarded $18.6 million to Julie Miller of Marion County against Equifax for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In her lawsuit, Miller alleged Equifax had merged her credit reports with another person with a different Social Security number, date of birth, and address. Miller contacted Equifax repeatedly in writing and over the telephone, but Equifax refused to delete dozens of false collection accounts from Miller&#x27;s credit report. The award included $18.4 million in punitive damages, and $180,000 in compensatory damages. Miller&#x27;s lawyer, Justin Baxter, explained that the false reporting damaged Miller&#x27;s reputation, she was denied credit, and her private information was given to businesses Miller had no relationship with. The jury&#x27;s verdict is believed to be the largest award in an individual case under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. An Equifax spokesperson said that Equifax is considering appealing the jury&#x27;s verdict. A federal judge reduced the award to $1.62 million in 2014.

In 2014, Equifax and Heartland Bank were sued by Kimberly Haman of the St. Louis area for reporting she was dead. A Heartland Bank spokesperson said the bank &quot;immediately investigated and contacted the credit reporting agencies after Haman reported&quot; she was still alive. An Equifax &quot;spokesperson told the Post-Dispatch that Equifax blocked the Heartland account information from appearing on Haman&#x27;s credit report after a reporter&#x27;s inquiry.&quot;

In April 2014, Equifax was sued in New York federal court by God Gazarov, who claimed the company erroneously reports him as having no credit history because of his unusual first name. Gazarov settled his lawsuit in May 2015, with Equifax agreeing to enter his name into their database.

On November 4, 2017, it was reported that a group of five Oklahomans had sued the company, claiming that Equifax &quot;violated laws which require financial institutions to protect the security of their customers&#x27; personal information.&quot; Equifax selected the law firm DLA Piper to work on the case in D.C. It had turned to Edelman for earlier crisis control after the October 2017 privacy breach.

Consumer lawsuits claiming damages under the FCRA have been successful in small claims court.

Equifax software engineer Sudhakar Reddy was charged with insider trading for purchasing options prior to the disclosure of the 2017 data breach.

In January 2020, Equifax agreed to a global settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and 50 U.S. states and territories. For those that were affected by the data breach, there were open suggestions to file claims against it. The settlement includes up to $425 million to help people affected by the data breach. Equifax ultimately reached a settlement with regulators for up to $700 million.

In October 2023, the UK&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority fined Equifax more than £11 million for failing to secure UK customer data.

In May 2024, mortgage lenders First Financial Lending and Greystone Mortgage filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Equifax, accusing the company of monopolizing the market for electronic income and employment verification services, allegedly leading to higher prices.

<text>The Shankill Road () is one of the main roads leading through West Belfast, in Northern Ireland. It runs through the working-class, predominantly loyalist, area known as the Shankill.

The road stretches westwards for about from central Belfast and is lined, to an extent, by shops. The residents live in the many streets which branch off the main road. The area along the Shankill Road forms part of the Court district electoral area.

In Ulster-Scots it is known as either &quot;Auld Kirk Gate&quot; (&quot;Old Church Way&quot;), or as &quot;Auld Kirk Raa&quot; (&quot;Old Church Road&quot;). In Irish, it is known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;the road of the old church&quot;).

==History==

The first Shankill residents lived at the bottom of what is now known as Glencairn: a small settlement of ancient people inhabited a ring fort, built where the Ballygomartin and Forth rivers meet.

A settlement around the point at which the Shankill Road becomes the Woodvale Road, at the junction with Cambrai Street, was known as Shankill from the Irish &quot;Seanchill&quot; meaning &quot;old church&quot;. Believed to date back to 455 AD, it was known as the &quot;Church of St Patrick of the White Ford&quot; and in time had six smaller churches, known as &quot;alterages&quot;, attached to it across the west bank of the River Lagan. The church was an important site of pilgrimage and it is likely that the ford of the River Farset, which later became the core of Belfast, was important because of its site on the pilgrimage route. It was in ruins by the 17th century and had disappeared entirely by the 19th, leaving only its graveyard. Its font, an ancient bullaun stone, resides at St Matthew&#x27;s on Woodvale Road, and is said to hold the power to heal warts.

As a paved road the Shankill dates back to around the sixteenth century as at the time it was part of the main road to Antrim, a role now filled by the A6. The lower sections of the Shankill Road were in former times the edge of Belfast with both Boundary Street on the lower Shankill and Townsend Street in the middle Shankill taking their names from the fact that at the time they were built they marked the approximate end of Belfast.

The area expanded greatly in the mid to late 19th century with the growth of the linen industry. Many of the streets in the Shankill area, such as Leopold Street, Cambrai Street and Brussels Street, were named after places and people connected with Belgium or Flanders, where the flax from which the linen was woven was grown. The linen industry, along with others that had previously been successful in the area, declined in the mid-20th century leading to high unemployment levels. The Harland and Wolff shipyard was also a traditional employer for the area, and it too has seen its workforce numbers decline in recent years.

The area was also a regular scene of rioting in the nineteenth century, often of a sectarian nature after Irish Catholic areas on the Falls Road and Ardoyne emerged along with the city&#x27;s prosperity. One such riot occurred on 9 June 1886 following the defeat of the Government of Ireland Bill 1886, when a crowd of around 2,000 locals clashed with the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) who were attempting to stop the mob from looting a liquor store. Local law enforcement officers had to barricade themselves in Bower&#x27;s Hill barracks where a long siege followed. Bower&#x27;s Hill was a name applied to the area of the road between Agnes Street and Crimea Street.

The West Belfast Division of the original Ulster Volunteer Force organised on the Shankill and drilled in Glencairn and some of its members saw service in the First World War with the 36th (Ulster) Division. A garden of remembrance beside the Shankill Graveyard and a mural on Conway Street commemorate those who fought in the war. Recruitment was also high during the Second World War and that conflict saw damage occur to the Shankill Road as part of the Belfast Blitz when a Luftwaffe bomb hit a shelter on Percy Street, killing many people. The site of the destruction was visited by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester soon after the attack.

===The Troubles===

During the Troubles, the Shankill was a centre of loyalist activity. The modern Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had its genesis on the Shankill and its first attack occurred on the road on 7 May 1966 when a group of UVF men led by Gusty Spence petrol bombed a Catholic-owned pub. Fire also engulfed the house next door, killing seventy-seven-year-old Protestant widow, Matilda Gould, who lived there. This was followed on 27 May by the murder of John Scullion, a Catholic, as he walked home from a pub. On 26 June a Catholic civilian, Peter Ward, a native of the Republic of Ireland, was killed and two others wounded as they left a pub on the Shankill&#x27;s Malvern Street. Shortly after this attack, Spence and three others were arrested and later convicted. The UVF continued to be active on the Shankill throughout the Troubles, most notoriously with the Shankill Butchers led by Lenny Murphy, as well as the likes of William Marchant and Frankie Curry, the latter a member of the Red Hand Commando.
Similarly, the Ulster Defence Association, established in September 1971, began on the Shankill when vigilante groups such as John McKeague&#x27;s Shankill Defence Association and the Woodvale Defence Association merged into a larger structure. Under the leadership of Charles Harding Smith and Andy Tyrie, the Shankill Road became a centre of UDA activity. Leading members such as James Craig, Davy Payne and Tommy Lyttle lived in the area. The Shankill was covered by the West Belfast Battalion of the UDA, which was divided into three companies: A (Glencairn and Highfield), B (middle Shankill), and C (lower Shankill). During the 1990s, C Company under Johnny Adair became one of the most active units in the UDA, with gunmen such as Stephen McKeag responsible for several murders. C Company would later feud with both the UVF and the rest of the UDA until 2003 when they were forced out. Following the exile of Adair and his supporters, as well as the murder of Alan McCullough, the lower Shankill UDA was once again brought into line with the rest of the movement under former Adair supporter Mo Courtney.
The Greater Shankill and its residents were also subjected to a number of bombings and shootings by Irish republican paramilitaries. During 1971 two pub bombings took place on the Shankill, one in May at the Mountainview Tavern, at which several people were injured, and a second at the Four Step Inn in September, which resulted in two deaths. A further bomb exploded at the Balmoral Furnishing Company on 11 December that same year, resulting in four deaths, including two infants. The Mountainview Tavern was attacked again by Republicans on the 5 April 1975 in a gun &amp; bomb attack which resulted in the deaths of four Protestant civilians &amp; a UDA member, 60 people were injured in the attack. Another pub attack followed on 13 August 1975 when the IRA opened fire on patrons outside the Bayardo Bar and then left a bomb inside the crowded bar area, killing four civilians and one UVF member. Brendan McFarlane was given a life sentence for his part in the attack.

The Shankill Road bombing occurred on 23 October 1993. A bomb exploded in Frizzell&#x27;s Fish Shop, below the UDA&#x27;s Shankill headquarters. The bomb exploded prematurely as it was being planted. Nine people were killed in addition to one of the bombers, Thomas Begley. None of the loyalist paramilitaries targeted were hurt, as they had postponed a planned meeting. Begley&#x27;s accomplice, Sean Kelly, survived and was imprisoned.

Eight months after the Fish shop bombing, volunteers from the Republican paramilitary group the Irish National Liberation Army shot &amp; killed three UVF volunteers and injured a civilian outside the headquarters of Progressive Unionist Party, killing a UVF commander Trevor King.

==Areas of the Shankill Road==

===Lower Shankill===
The Shankill Road begins at Peter&#x27;s Hill, a road that flows from North Street in Belfast city centre and quickly merges into the Shankill itself at the Westlink. Peter&#x27;s Hill is adjacent to Carrick Hill, a small nationalist area to the north of the city centre. The area of housing on the lower Shankill around Agnes Street was known colloquially as &quot;The Hammer&quot;, one of a number of nicknames applied to districts that included &quot;the Nick&quot;. The Hammer name is recalled in the Hammer Sports Complex, the home ground of amateur football side Shankill United F.C. The Lower Shankill has been redeveloped in recent years although during the 1960s the housing was ranked as the worst in Belfast. A Lower Shankill Community Association is active in the area whilst the Shankill Leisure Centre is also located here. The Shankill Women&#x27;s Centre, a women&#x27;s educational initiative established by May Blood (later Baroness Blood) in 1987, is also located on the lower Shankill. George McWhirter, a writer and first Poet Laureate of Vancouver, B.C., Canada, also came from the area originally.
Several streets link the Shankill Road to the neighbouring Crumlin Road with the area around North Boundary Street formerly the stronghold of Johnny Adair&#x27;s C Company. Several members of C Company who have died are commemorated on murals around the area, notably Stephen McKeag, William &quot;Bucky&quot; McCullough, who was killed by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) in 1981 as part of a series of tit for tat murders between that group and the UDA and Jackie Coulter, killed by the UVF during a loyalist feud in 2000. The area links to the neighbouring Falls Road at Townsend Street and Northumberland Street where there are gates in the peace line that are opened in daytime.

The Lower Shankill is home to many loyalist pubs, the most notable being the &quot;Royal Bar&quot;, associated with the UVF, and the &quot;Diamond Jubilee&quot; – a UDA haunt which became notorious as the main meeting place of &quot;C Company&quot; during the early 1990s. The &quot;Long Bar&quot; and the &quot;Windsor Bar&quot;, both frequented by the UVF in the 1970s, have since vanished. According to investigative journalist Martin Dillon, the latter was used a centre of operations for a UVF platoon led by Anthony &quot;Chuck&quot; Berry.

===Middle and upper Shankill===

Although there is no precise dividing line between the Lower, Middle and Upper Shankill locally it is usually said that the lower Shankill ends at Agnes Street. The area was redeveloped some time before the lower Shankill leading to feelings locally that those in the upper part of the road were better off compared to the &quot;Apaches&quot; of the lower Shankill as they were colloquially known. A number of Protestant churches are situated in this area including the West Kirk Presbyterian Church, the Shankill Methodist church and the independent Church of God.

The West Belfast Orange Hall is located near the top of the road. This building, which houses the No. 9 District Orange Lodge, has been revamped by Belfast City Council. The same is true of the nearby Shankill Cemetery, a small graveyard that has received burials for around 1000 years. The graveyard is noted for a statue of Queen Victoria as well as the adjacent memorial to the members of the 36th Ulster Division who died at the Battle of the Somme. Amongst those buried in the Shankill Graveyard is Rev Isaac Nelson, a Presbyterian minister who was also active in nationalist politics. Nelson lived at Sugarfield House on the Shankill, which has since given its name to Sugarfield Street. Also buried here is 2nd Private W.A. Sterling on 5 November 1918 at the age of 14.

The area includes Lanark Way, one of the few direct links to the neighbouring nationalist areas, which leads directly to the Springfield Road (although the street is gated close to the Springfield Road end and these are locked at night). A regular route for UDA gunmen seeking access to the Falls during the Troubles, it was dubbed the &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot; by Stephen McKeag and his men.

A number of pubs frequented by UVF members were located in the area. These included the &quot;Berlin Arms&quot; at the Shankill and Berlin Street junction, and the &quot;Bayardo&quot;, which was situated on the corner of Shankill and Aberdeen Street. The pub was close to &quot;The Eagle&quot; where the UVF &quot;Brigade Staff&quot; had their headquarters in rooms above a chip shop bearing the same name at the Shankill and Spiers Place junction. The &quot;Brown Bear&quot; pub which loyalist Lenny Murphy used as his headquarters to direct his notorious murder gang – the Shankill Butchers – was located on the corner of the Upper Shankill and Mountjoy Street. The pub, which went out of business, has since been demolished. Another drinking den in the area used by Murphy and his gang was the &quot;Lawnbrook Social Club&quot; in Centurion Street. The &quot;Rex Bar&quot; on the middle Shankill is one of the oldest pubs on the Shankill Road and frequented by members of the UVF. This bar was attacked by members of the UDA&#x27;s C Company in 2000 to launch a loyalist feud between the two groups.
===Greater Shankill===
The term, &quot;Greater Shankill&quot;, is used by a number of groups active in the area, most notably the Greater Shankill Partnership, to refer to both the Shankill Road and the unionist/loyalist areas that surround it. The main areas identified within this area are Woodvale, Glencairn, and Highfield. The Greater Shankill as a whole has a population of around 22,000.

====Woodvale====
The Woodvale area begins after Lanark Way, when the road changes from Shankill Road to Woodvale Road. As well as extensive housing the Woodvale area contains the Woodvale Presbyterian Church, which building on the corner of the Woodvale and Ballygomartin Roads dates back to 1899. The area takes its name from Woodvale Park, a public gardens and sports area that was opened in 1888.

Also found locally is St. Matthew&#x27;s Church of Ireland, which was rebuilt in 1872 and is named after the original church which had sat in the grounds of the Shankill graveyard. The architecture of this church is called trefoil, which means it is built in the shape of a shamrock. The oldest stone in the Shankill graveyard was known locally as the &quot;Bullaun Stone&quot; and was traditionally said to cure warts if the affected area were rubbed on the stone. It was removed to the grounds of St Matthews in 1911.

====Glencairn====

Glencairn is an area based around the Ballygomartin Road, which runs off the Woodvale Road, as well the Forthriver Road. It is bordered by the Crumlin Road. As well as a large housing estate the area also includes Glencairn Park, a large woodland area at the bottom of Divis Mountain. Previously the estate of the Cunningham family the area was open to the public in 1962. The park features Fernhill House, the ancestral family home, which was not only used by Edward Carson to drill his Ulster Volunteers but was also the setting for the announcement of the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) ceasefire on 13 October 1994. It subsequently became a museum but closed down in late 2010-early 2011. A further area of housing, known as the Lyndhurst area after a number of local streets, lies to the west of Glencairn Park (with the Glencairn estate to the east of the woodland area). The Ballygomartin Road extends as far as the Upper Whiterock Road although after Springmartin the area is mainly countryside.

The estate was the scene of the killings of two prominent loyalists. In 1982 Lenny Murphy was shot and killed by the Provisional IRA close to his girlfriend&#x27;s house on the estate. In 2001 William Stobie was killed on Forthriver Road by members of the UDA, a group to which Stobie had formerly belonged, after intimating that he would testify at a public inquiry into the death of Pat Finucane.

====Highfield====

Highfield is a housing estate situated around the West Circular and Springmartin Roads, both of which run off the Ballygomartin Road. Highfield comes close to the nationalist Springfield Road and there is access between the two areas through West Circular and Springmartin. Due to its location parts of the area are sometimes known as the Springmartin estate. Highfield is seen as an enclave and has been the scene of sectarian tension. As a consequence the Springmartin Road is home to an peace line that runs for the length of the road from the junction with the Springfield Road until near that with the Ballygomartin Road. In May 1972 the area was the scene of a two-day gun battle between republican and loyalist paramilitaries and the British Army. The peace line ensured that such open conflict was not repeated later in the Troubles.

==Politics==

The Shankill has been traditionally unionist and loyalist, albeit with some strength also held by the labour movement. Belfast Shankill, covering the north-west part of the Shankill Road, was established as a constituency of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1929 and existed until the body was abolished in 1973. During that time the seat was held by three men, Tommy Henderson (1929–1953), Henry Holmes (1953–1960) and Desmond Boal (1960–1973). Of these only Holmes belonged to the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party for the entirety of his career with Boal a sometime member who also designated as both independent Unionist and Democratic Unionist Party and Henderson always an independent who for a time was part of the Independent Unionist Association. Henderson was a native of Dundee Street on the Shankill.

A Belfast Shankill constituency also returned a member to the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1918–1922, with Labour Unionist Samuel McGuffin holding the seat. The areas south of the road were covered by the Belfast Woodvale seat at Westminster and a seat of the same name at Stormont. Robert John Lynn of the Irish Unionist Alliance represented the seat at Westminster for the entirety of its existence (1918–1922). The Stormont seat was held by John William Nixon (independent Unionist) from 1929 to 1950, Ulster Unionists Robert Harcourt (1950–1955) and Neville Martin (1955–1958), Billy Boyd of the Northern Ireland Labour Party until 1965 then finally John McQuade, who was variously Ulster Unionist, independent Unionist and Democratic Unionist until the seat was abolished in 1972.

The Shankill is currently part of the Belfast West constituencies for the Northern Ireland Assembly and Westminster. At the Assembly the Shankill is represented by four Sinn Féin MLAs and one from the People Before Profit Alliance. At Westminster, since 1966, when the seat was lost by the last sitting unionist member Jim Kilfedder, it has also always had a nationalist or republican MP. The abstentionist policy of Sinn Féin MP Gerry Adams, who was West Belfast&#x27;s MP until his resignation in 2011, led to an attempted legal challenge by local councillor Frank McCoubrey who argued that Shankill residents were being denied their right to representation. The case was not a success.

On Belfast City Council the Greater Shankill area is covered by the Court electoral area. At the 2019 election the six councillors elected were Frank McCoubrey, Brian Kingston and Nicola Verner of the Democratic Unionist Party, Claire Canavan and Tina Black of Sinn Fein and the Progressive Unionist Party&#x27;s Billy Hutchinson.

Robert McCartney, who led his own UK Unionist Party and represented North Down at Westminster, is also originally from the Shankill.

==Education==
Secondary schools serving the Shankill area include the Belfast Boys&#x27; Model School and Belfast Model School for Girls due to their location in the Ballysillan area of the neighbouring Crumlin Road. Pupils from the area also attend Hazelwood College or Malone College which are both integrated schools, as well as Victoria College and the Royal Belfast Academical Institution both of which are grammar schools. Prior to its closure, and before several changes of name, Cairnmartin Secondary School also served the greater Shankill area. Famous pupils include footballer Norman Whiteside and boxer Wayne McCullough. The school, by then known as Mount Gilbert Community College, closed permanently in 2007 after a fall in pupil numbers.

Primary schools in the greater Shankill area included Forth River Primary School on the Ballygomartin Road. Established in 1841, the original building was cramped and inspection reports over the years commented on the high standard of teaching despite the inadequacy of the building. During the 1980s and 1990s, closure and amalgamation were both suggested and vehemently opposed by everyone connected with the school. Ultimately a new £1.4m state-of-the-art school was announced as a replacement for the old building and this new school, which is on the adjacent Cairnmartin Road, was officially opened by Prince Andrew, Duke of York in 2005. Others primary schools in the area include three on the Shankill Road itself in Glenwood Primary School, established in 1981, Edenbrooke Primary School on Tennent Street and Malvern Primary School as well as Black Mountain Primary School and Springhill Primary School on Springmartin Road.

==Sport==
Wayne McCullough, a gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games and a world champion in the Bantamweight division and an Olympic silver medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics representing Ireland is a native of the Shankill. He is one of a number of boxers from the area to be featured on a mural on Gardiner Street celebrating the area&#x27;s strong heritage in boxing. The image has since been moved to Hopewell Crescent. McCullough trained in the Albert Foundry boxing club, located in the Highfield estate where he grew up. Other locals to make an impact in the sport have included Jimmy Warnock, a boxer from the 1930s who beat world champion Benny Lynch twice, and his brother Billy.

Football is also a popular sport in the area with local teams including Shankill United, Albert Foundry, who play on the West Circular Road, Lower Shankill, who share the Hammer ground with United and Woodvale who won the Junior Cup in 2011. All four clubs are members of the Northern Amateur Football League. The main club in the area however is Linfield with a Linfield superstore trading on the Shankill Road despite the club being based on the Lisburn Road in south Belfast. A Linfield Supporters and Social Club is situated on Crimea Street. An Ulster Rangers social club is also open on the road, with the Glasgow team widely supported amongst Northern Irish Protestants. Norman Whiteside, the ex-Northern Ireland and Manchester United midfielder, lived on the Shankill. Whiteside also lends his name to the Norman Whiteside Sports Facility, a community sports area used by Woodvale F.C. The facility is located on Sydney Street West between the Shankill and the neighbouring Crumlin Road. George O&#x27;Boyle, who had a long career in Scottish football, is also a Shankill native.

The Ballygomartin Road is also home to a cricket ground of the same name which in 2005 hosted a List-A match between Canada and Namibia in the 2005 ICC Trophy. The ground is the home of Woodvale Cricket Club, established in 1887.

==Transport==
Belfast was served by a network of trams in the first half of the 20th century and the Shankill was the last part of the city to see this service removed in the 1950s. Public transport is now provided by the Metro arm of Translink with the Shankill forming the eleventh of the company&#x27;s twelve corridors. Buses link Belfast City Centre to the estates at the top of the Shankill as well as the Ballysillan area of the Crumlin Road.

==Employment==
Mackies engineering was once at the heart of Belfast industry, employing thousands of men and women.

==Shankill graveyard==

The Shankill Graveyard is one of the oldest cemeteries in the Greater Belfast Area. It was used for active burials for more than 1,000 years, but is no longer an active burial site. George McAuley who died in 1685 has one of oldest legible headstones in the cemetery.

<text>Tieguanyin (; Standard Chinese pronunciation ) is a variety of Chinese oolong tea that originated in the 19th century in Anxi in Fujian province. Tieguanyin produced in different areas of Anxi have different gastronomic characteristics.

==Name==
The tea is named after the Chinese Goddess of Mercy Guanyin, Guanyin is an embodiment of Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. Other spellings and names include &quot;Ti Kuan Yin&quot;, &quot;Tit Kwun Yum&quot;, &quot;Ti Kwan Yin&quot;, &quot;Iron Buddha&quot;, &quot;Iron Goddess Oolong&quot;, and &quot;Tea of the Iron Bodhisattva&quot;. It is also known in its abbreviated form as &quot;TGY&quot;.

==Legends==

There are two legends behind this tea: Wei and Wang.

===Wei legend===
In Fujian&#x27;s Anxi County, there was a run-down temple which held an iron statue of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion. Every day on the walk to his tea fields, a poor farmer named Wei would pass by and reflect on the temple&#x27;s worsening condition. &quot;Something has to be done,&quot; he thought.

Being poor, Wei did not have the means to repair the temple. One day, he brought a broom and some incense from his home. He swept the temple clean and lit the incense as an offering to Guanyin. &quot;It&#x27;s the least I can do,&quot; he thought to himself. And he did this twice a week for many months.

One night, Guanyin appeared to him in a dream, telling him of a cave behind the temple where a treasure awaited. He was to take the treasure and share it with others. In the cave, the farmer found a tea shoot. He planted it in his field and nurtured it into a large bush, from which the finest tea was produced. He gave cuttings of this rare plant to all his neighbors and began selling the tea under the name Tieguanyin, Iron Bodhisattva of Compassion.

Over time, Wei and all his neighbors prospered; the run-down temple of Guanyin was repaired and became a beacon for the region. From this time onwards Mr. Wei took joy in the daily trip to his tea fields, never failing to stop in appreciation of the beautiful temple.

===Wang legend===
Wang was a scholar who accidentally discovered the tea plant beneath the Guanyin rock in Xiping. He brought the plant back home for cultivation. When he visited the Qianlong Emperor in the 6th year of his reign, he offered the tea as a gift from his native village. The emperor was so impressed that he inquired about its origin. Since the tea was discovered beneath the Guanyin Rock, he decided to call it the Guanyin tea.

==Processing of Tieguanyin tea==

The processing of Tieguanyin tea is complex and requires expertise. Even if the tea leaf is of high raw quality and is plucked at the ideal time, if it is not processed correctly, its true character will not be shown. This is why the method of processing Tieguanyin tea was kept a secret.

* &quot;Jade Tieguanyin&quot; (lightly baked Tieguanyin) is a newer type of Tieguanyin developed in the 1990s and has a light green jade color. It produces a very flowery aroma and taste. It is more similar to green tea than Oolong.
* &quot;Thoroughly baked Tieguanyin&quot; is the original style. It has a more complex taste profile and warm aroma, but the traditional baking technique has not been passed on well, so quality ones of this style are less seen in the market than &quot;moderately baked&quot; and &quot;lightly baked&quot; versions.
* &quot;Moderately baked Tieguanyin&quot; is a new breed that some argue has a good balance of floral aroma and complex taste, but it stores poorly.
By harvest time:
* &quot;Spring Tieguanyin&quot; is harvested around Li Xia (Start of Summer) and has the best overall quality.
* &quot;Autumn Tieguanyin&quot; is harvested in the autumn and has strong aroma but less complex taste.
* &quot;Summer Tieguanyin&quot; is harvested in summer and is considered lower quality. Summer Tieguanyin can be further divided into two types: one harvested in June to July, one harvested in August.
* &quot;Winter Tieguanyin&quot; is harvested in winter. Production of Winter Tieguanyin is very low.
Other categories:
* &quot;Guanyin Wang&quot; (Guanyin &quot;King&quot;) is the best of Jade Tieguanyin and Autumn Tieguanyin.

==Types==
Based on the different roasting methods and locations, there are various types of Tieguanyin.

*Anxi Tieguanyin Tea () – Recently, this oolong is typically close to a green tea, with only a little oxidation. With a very flowery and fresh delicate aroma character, the tea liquid is golden yellow. In the past, the tea was traditionally more heavily roasted.
*Muzha Tieguanyin Tea () – This traditional oolong is roasted and has a stronger taste and with roast nutty character; the tea liquid is reddish brown.

In Taiwan, Iron Goddess Tea describes oolong tea that is roasted using the Iron Goddess Tea method, regardless of the type of tea leaves used. 

==Market value==
The top varieties of Tieguanyin rank among the most expensive tea in the world, with one variety reportedly sold at around 3000 USD per kilogram. According to one source, it set the record for most expensive tea ever sold in the United Kingdom. However, that variety of Tieguanyin did not outsell a rarer Da Hong Pao oolong, which is the most expensive tea sold on the global market.

<doc id="961291" wikidata="Q898356" url="?curid=961291" title="Glycocalyx">
<text>The glycocalyx (: glycocalyces or glycocalyxes), also known as the pericellular matrix and cell coat, is a layer of glycoproteins and glycolipids which surround the cell membranes of bacteria, epithelial cells, and other cells.

Animal epithelial cells have a fuzz-like coating on the external surface of their plasma membranes. This viscous coating is the glycocalyx that consists of several carbohydrate moieties of membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins, which serve as backbone molecules for support. Generally, the carbohydrate portion of the glycolipids found on the surface of plasma membranes helps these molecules contribute to cell–cell recognition, communication, and intercellular adhesion.

The glycocalyx is a type of identifier that the body uses to distinguish between its own healthy cells and transplanted tissues, diseased cells, or invading organisms. Included in the glycocalyx are cell-adhesion molecules that enable cells to adhere to each other and guide the movement of cells during embryonic development. The glycocalyx plays a major role in regulation of endothelial vascular tissue, including the modulation of red blood cell volume in capillaries.

The term was initially applied to the polysaccharide matrix coating epithelial cells, but its functions have been discovered to go well beyond that.

==In vascular endothelial tissue==

The glycocalyx is located on the apical surface of vascular endothelial cells which line the lumen. When vessels are stained with cationic dyes such as Alcian blue stain, transmission electron microscopy shows a small, irregularly shaped layer extending approximately 50–100 nm into the lumen of a blood vessel. Another study used osmium tetroxide staining during freeze substitution, and showed that the endothelial glycocalyx could be up to 11 μm thick. It is present throughout a diverse range of microvascular beds (capillaries) and macrovessels (arteries and veins). The glycocalyx also consists of a wide range of enzymes and proteins that regulate leukocyte and thrombocyte adherence, since its principal role in the vasculature is to maintain plasma and vessel-wall homeostasis. These enzymes and proteins include:
*Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (endothelial NOS)
*Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3)
*Angiotensin converting enzyme
*Antithrombin-III
*Lipoprotein lipase
*Apolipoproteins
*Growth factors
*Chemokines

The enzymes and proteins listed above serve to reinforce the glycocalyx barrier against vascular and other diseases. Another main function of the glycocalyx within the vascular endothelium is that it shields the vascular walls from direct exposure to blood flow, while serving as a vascular permeability barrier. Its protective functions are universal throughout the vascular system, but its relative importance varies depending on its exact location in the vasculature. In microvascular tissue, the glycocalyx serves as a vascular permeability barrier by inhibiting coagulation and leukocyte adhesion. Leukocytes must not stick to the vascular wall because they are important components of the immune system that must be able to travel to a specific region of the body when needed. In arterial vascular tissue, the glycocalyx also inhibits coagulation and leukocyte adhesion, but through mediation of shear stress-induced nitric oxide release. Another protective function throughout the cardiovascular system is its ability to affect the filtration of interstitial fluid from capillaries into the interstitial space.

The glycocalyx, which is located on the apical surface of endothelial cells, is composed of a negatively charged network of proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. Along the luminal surface of the vascular glycocalyx exists an empty layer that excludes red blood cells.

==Disruption and disease==

Because the glycocalyx is so prominent throughout the cardiovascular system, disruption to this structure has detrimental effects that can cause disease. Certain stimuli that cause atheroma may lead to enhanced sensitivity of vasculature. Initial dysfunction of the glycocalyx can be caused by hyperglycemia or oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which then causes atherothrombosis. In microvasculature, dysfunction of the glycocalyx leads to internal fluid imbalance, and potentially edema. In arterial vascular tissue, glycocalyx disruption causes inflammation and atherothrombosis.

Experiments have been performed to test precisely how the glycocalyx can be altered or damaged. One particular study used an isolated perfused heart model designed to facilitate detection of the state of the vascular barrier portion, and sought to cause insult-induced shedding of the glycocalyx to ascertain the cause-and-effect relationship between glycocalyx shedding and vascular permeability. Hypoxic perfusion of the glycocalyx was thought to be sufficient to initiate a degradation mechanism of the endothelial barrier. The study found that flow of oxygen throughout the blood vessels did not have to be completely absent (ischemic hypoxia), but that minimal levels of oxygen were sufficient to cause the degradation. Shedding of the glycocalyx can be triggered by inflammatory stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Whatever the stimulus is, however, shedding of the glycocalyx leads to a drastic increase in vascular permeability. Vascular walls being permeable is disadvantageous, since that would enable passage of some macromolecules or other harmful antigens.

Other sources of damage to the endothelial glycocalyx have been observed in several pathological conditions such as inflammation, hyperglycemia, ischemia-reperfusion, viral infections and sepsis.

Some key components of the glycocalyx such as syndecans, heparan sulphate, chondroitin sulphate and hyaluronan can be shed of the endothelial layer by enzymes. Hyaluronidase, hepararanse/heparinase, matrix and membrane-type matrix metalloproteases, thrombin, plasmin and elastase are some examples of enzymes that can induce shedding of the glycocalyx and these sheddases can therefor contribute to degradation of the glycocalyx layer in several pathological conditions. Research shows that plasma hyaluronidase activity is decreased in experimental as well as in clinical septic shock and is therefore not considered to be a sheddase in sepsis. Concomitant, the endogenous plasma inhibition of hyaluronidase is increased and could serve as a protection against glycocalyx shedding.

Fluid shear stress is also a potential problem if the glycocalyx is degraded for any reason. This type of frictional stress is caused by the movement of viscous fluid (i.e. blood) along the lumen boundary. Another similar experiment was carried out to determine what kinds of stimuli cause fluid shear stress. The initial measurement was taken with intravital microscopy, which showed a slow-moving plasma layer, the glycocalyx, of 1 μm thick. Light dye damaged the glycocalyx minimally, but that small change increased capillary hematocrit. Thus, fluorescence light microscopy should not be used to study the glycocalyx because that particular method uses a dye. The glycocalyx can also be reduced in thickness when treated with oxidized LDL. These stimuli, along with many other factors, can cause damage to the delicate glycocalyx. These studies are evidence that the glycocalyx plays a crucial role in cardiovascular system health.

==In bacteria and nature==

A glycocalyx, literally meaning &quot;sugar coat&quot; (&quot;glykys&quot; = sweet, &quot;kalyx&quot; = husk), is a network of polysaccharides that project from cellular surfaces of bacteria, which classifies it as a universal surface component of a bacterial cell, found just outside the bacterial cell wall. A distinct, gelatinous glycocalyx is called a capsule, whereas an irregular, diffuse layer is called a slime layer. This coat is extremely hydrated and stains with ruthenium red.

Bacteria growing in natural ecosystems, such as in soil, bovine intestines, or the human urinary tract, are surrounded by some sort of glycocalyx-enclosed microcolony. It serves to protect the bacterium from harmful phagocytes by creating capsules or allowing the bacterium to attach itself to inert surfaces, such as teeth or rocks, via biofilms (e.g. &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; attaches itself to either lung cells, prokaryotes, or other bacteria which can fuse their glycocalices to envelop the colony).

==In the digestive tract==

A glycocalyx can also be found on the apical portion of microvilli within the digestive tract, especially within the small intestine. It creates a meshwork 0.3 μm thick and consists of acidic mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins that project from the apical plasma membrane of epithelial absorptive cells. It provides additional surface for adsorption and includes enzymes secreted by the absorptive cells that are essential for the final steps of digestion of proteins and sugars.

==Other generalized functions==
*Protection: Cushions the plasma membrane and protects it from chemical injury
*Immunity to infection: Enables the immune system to recognize and selectively attack foreign organisms
*Defense against cancer: Changes in the glycocalyx of cancerous cells enable the immune system to recognize and destroy them.
*Transplant compatibility: Forms the basis for compatibility of blood transfusions, tissue grafts, and organ transplants
*Cell adhesion: Binds cells together so that tissues do not fall apart
*Inflammation regulation: Glycocalyx coating on endothelial walls in blood vessels prevents leukocytes from rolling/binding in healthy states.
*Fertilization: Enables sperm to recognize and bind to eggs
*Embryonic development: Guides embryonic cells to their destinations in the body

<text>Messier 34 (also known as M34, NGC 1039, or the Spiral Cluster) is a large and relatively near open cluster in Perseus. It was probably discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects in 1764. Messier described it as, &quot;A cluster of small stars a little below the parallel of γ (Andromedae). In an ordinary telescope of 3 feet one can distinguish the stars.&quot;

Based on the distance modulus of 8.38, it is about away. For stars ranging from 0.12 to 1 solar mass (), the cluster has about 400. It spans about 35′ on the sky which translates to a true radius of 7.5 light years at such distance. The cluster is just visible to the naked eye in very dark conditions, well away from city lights. It is possible to see it in binoculars when light pollution is low.

The age of this cluster lies between the ages of the Pleiades open cluster at 100 million years and the Hyades open cluster at 800 million years. Specifically, comparison between noted stellar spectra and the values predicted by stellar evolutionary models suggest 200–250 million years. This is roughly the age at which stars with half a solar mass enter the main sequence. By comparison, stars like the Sun enter the main sequence after 30 million years.

The average proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is termed the metallicity by astronomers. This is expressed by the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen, compared to the same proportion in the Sun. For M34, the metallicity has a value of [Fe/H] = +0.07 ± 0.04. This is equivalent to a 17% higher proportion of iron compared to the Sun. Other elements show a similar abundance, save for nickel which is underabundant.

At least 19 members are white dwarfs. These are stellar remnants of progenitor stars of up to eight solar masses () that have evolved through the main sequence and are no longer have thermonuclear fusion to generate energy. Seventeen of these are of spectral type DA or DAZ, while one is a type DB and the last is a type DC.

<text>The Maltese cross is a cross symbol, consisting of four &quot;V&quot; or arrowhead shaped concave quadrilaterals converging at a central vertex at right angles, two tips pointing outward symmetrically.

It is a heraldic cross variant which developed from earlier forms of eight-pointed crosses in the 16th century. Although chiefly associated with the Knights Hospitaller (Order of St. John, now the Sovereign Military Order of Malta), and by extension with the island of Malta, it has come to be used by a wide array of entities since the early modern period,
notably the Order of Saint Stephen, the city of Amalfi, the Polish Order of the White Eagle (1709), the Prussian order &quot;Pour le Mérite&quot; (1740), and the Bavarian Military Merit Order (1866).

Unicode defines a character named &quot;Maltese cross&quot; in the Dingbats range at code point U+2720 (✠); however, most computer fonts render the code point as a cross pattée.

==History==

The Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades used a plain Latin cross. 
Occasional use of the modern form straight-edged &quot;eight-pointed cross&quot; by the order begins in the early 16th century.
This early form is a cross moline (ancrée) or cross branchée ending in eight points, not yet featuring the sharp vertex of the modern design. 
The association of the eight-pointed cross with the southern Italy coastal town of Amalfi may go back to the 11th century, as the design is allegedly found on coins minted by the Duchy of Amalfi at that time.

Eight-pointed crosses appear on coins minted by the Grand Masters of the order, first shown as a bolsini-type cross embroidered on the left arm of the robe of the kneeling Grand Master on the obverse of a coin minted under Foulques de Villaret (r. 1305–1319)
In 1489, the statutes of the order require all knights of Malta to wear &quot;the white cross with eight points&quot;.

Emergence of the sharp vertex of the modern &quot;four-arrowhead&quot; design is gradual, and takes place during the 15th to 16th century. The &quot;Rhodian cross&quot; of the early 16th century had almost, but not quite, achieved the &quot;sharp arrowhead appearance&quot;.
The fully modern design is found on a copper coin dated 1567, minted by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette (r. 1557–1568).
In 1577, Alonso Sanchez Coello painted Archduke Wenceslaus of Austria as Grand Prior of the Order of Malta wearing the emblem on his robes.

The design appears again on coins minted in the late 17th to 18th centuries. It is shown on a copper coin dated 1693, minted under Grand Master Adrien de Wignacourt.
From the end of the 17th century, it is also occasionally displayed as alternative heraldic emblem of the order.
Its depiction on the facade of San Giovannino dei Cavalieri dates to 1699.

==Symbolism==
The Maltese cross as defined by the constitution of the Order of St. John remains the symbol of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, of the Order of Saint John and its allied orders, of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and of their various service organisations. 
Numerous other modern orders of merit have used the eight-pointed cross. 
The British colony of Queensland, Australia, adopted the Maltese cross as the state badge and on the flag in 1876 for reasons unknown, its use continuing through to statehood.

The eight points of the eight-pointed cross have been given a number of symbolic interpretations, 
such as representing the eight Langues of the Knights Hospitaller (Auvergne, Provence, France, Aragon, Castille and Portugal, Italy, Germany, and the British Isles).
or alternatively the &quot;eight obligations or aspirations&quot; of the knights.

Websites operated by both the German Order of Saint John (&quot;Johanniterorden&quot;) and the British Venerable Order of St John associate the eight points with the Eight Beatitudes.
An undated leaflet published by The Venerable Order&#x27;s main service organisation, St John Ambulance, has also applied secular meanings to the points as representing the traits of a good first aider.

==Modern use==

===Republic of Malta===

The Maltese cross is displayed as part of the Maltese civil ensign, the Maltese naval jack and presidential standard has a Maltese cross in each corner. The Maltese euro coins of 1- and 2-euro denomination carry the Maltese cross. It is also the trademark of KM Malta Airlines, Malta&#x27;s national airline.

The Maltese cross was depicted on the two-mils coin in of the Maltese lira in 1972, and on the reverse of one- and two-Euro coins introduced in January 2008.

===Military and civil orders===

===Aviation===
In 1967, laboratory tests, and flight tests at Fort Rucker and Fort Wolters, were conducted to determine the most highly visible and effective way to mark a helipad.

Twenty-five emblem designs were tested, but the emblem depicting four blurred rotor blades, referred to as the &quot;Maltese cross&quot;, was selected as the standard heliport marking pattern by the Army for military heliports, and by the FAA for civil heliports.

However, in the late 1970s, the FAA administrator repealed this standard when it was charged that the Maltese cross was antisemitic. In the United States today, some helipads still remain bearing their original Maltese cross emblems.

The eight-pointed cross is also used to identify the final approach fix on FAA published approach plates. This is used on both precision and non-precision approaches.

===Maritime===
The vessel classification society for the United States, the American Bureau of Shipping, will assign the Maltese cross symbol to vessels and offshore units for which the hull construction and/or the manufacture of its machinery and components and any associated required testing, as applicable, is carried out under ABS survey.

===Medical===
Several orders that are descended from the original Order of St John set up first aid and ambulance services. These also incorporated the Maltese cross into their logos:

*The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps.
*The Johanniter-Unfall-Hilfe and the Malteser Hilfsdienst, the respective Protestant and Catholic ambulance services in Germany, have an eight-pointed cross in their emblems.
*Emergency medical services in Australia. This is due to the role of St John Ambulance, who continue to run the primary ambulance service in some states.
*The Bombeiros da Cruz de Malta (Maltese Cross Fire Brigade), a volunteer fire and medical emergency corps in Lisbon, Portugal, founded by Portuguese members of the Order of Malta.

=== UK railway ticketing ===

On the National Rail network, tickets marked with a Maltese cross are valid for travel on London Underground, Docklands Light Railway and Thameslink between two London Terminals, allowing passengers to make journeys that cross London. Passengers can break their journey at any intermediate station but cannot then resume their journey by Tube, DLR or Thameslink using their cross-London ticket.

Passengers holding tickets to a London fare zone marked with a Maltese cross can make one journey from the London Terminal at which they arrived to the zone in question.

==Eponymy==
The &quot;Maltese cross flower&quot; (&quot;Lychnis chalcedonica&quot;) is so named because its petals are similarly shaped, though its points are more rounded into &quot;heart&quot;-like shapes. The flower &quot;Tripterocalyx crux-maltae&quot; was also named for the Maltese cross. 
The Geneva drive, a device that translates a continuous rotation into an intermittent rotary motion, is also sometimes called a &quot;Maltese cross mechanism&quot; after the shape of its main gear.

==Similar crosses==


Eight-pointed crosses were adopted for use by the French Order of Saint Lazarus in the mid-16th century. The use of the green eight-pointed cross by the Order was retained right through to the 19th century and after the secular organization of the Order after 1910.

It has been the official badge (combined with an ellipsoid in the center) of the Delta Phi fraternity since 1833. 
A similar cross is also used by the Veterans of Foreign Wars organization.

A variant of the Maltese cross, with three V-shaped arms instead of four, was used as the funnel symbol of the Hamburg Atlantic Line and their successors German Atlantic Line and Hanseatic Tours in 1958–1973 and 1991–1997.

A five-armed variant is the &quot;Cross&quot; of the French Legion of Honour (&quot;Croix de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;).

A seven-armed variant, known as the &quot;Maltese asterisk&quot;, is used as the basis of Britain&#x27;s Order of St Michael and St George.

Other crosses with spreading limbs are often mistakenly called &quot;Maltese&quot;, especially the cross pattée. The royal warrant which created the Victoria Cross prescribed a Maltese cross, but the medal has always in fact been a cross pattée. The official symbol of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity is the cross pattée, though the organization&#x27;s founder thought it was a Maltese cross when the organization was formed in 1865. The Nestorian cross also is very similar to both of these. The Unicode Character “✠” (U+2720) is called a Maltese Cross, but is in fact a cross pattée.

The Firefighter&#x27;s Cross is often confused with the Maltese cross (for example, the New York City Fire Department so calls it); although it may have eight or more points, it also has large curved arcs between the points. The Philadelphia Fire Department, among others, incorporates the Firefighter&#x27;s Cross into its insignia, as does the International Association of Fire Fighters.

The Maltese cross should not be mistaken for the George Cross, awarded to Malta by George VI of the United Kingdom in 1942, which is depicted, since 1964, on the national flag of Malta. The Maltese cross is depicted on the civil ensign of Malta, shown above.

<text>An S-layer (surface layer) is a part of the cell envelope found in almost all archaea, as well as in many types of bacteria.
The S-layers of both archaea and bacteria consists of a monomolecular layer composed of only one (or, in a few cases, two) identical proteins or glycoproteins. This structure is built via self-assembly and encloses the whole cell surface. Thus, the S-layer protein can represent up to 15% of the whole protein content of a cell. S-layer proteins are poorly conserved or not conserved at all, and can differ markedly even between related species. Depending on species, the S-layers have a thickness between 5 and 25 nm and possess identical pores 2–8 nm in diameter.

The terminology “S-layer” was used the first time in 1976. The general use was accepted at the &quot;First International Workshop on Crystalline Bacterial Cell Surface Layers, Vienna (Austria)&quot; in 1984, and in the year 1987 S-layers were defined at the European Molecular Biology Organization Workshop on “Crystalline Bacterial Cell Surface Layers”, Vienna as “Two-dimensional arrays of proteinaceous subunits forming surface layers on prokaryotic cells” (see &quot;Preface&quot;, page VI in Sleytr &quot;et al. 1988&quot;). For a brief summary on the history of S-layer research see &quot;References&quot;&quot;.&quot; 

== Location of S-layers ==

* In Gram-negative bacteria, S-layers are associated to the lipopolysaccharides via ionic, carbohydrate–carbohydrate, protein–carbohydrate interactions and/or protein–protein interactions.
* In Gram-positive bacteria whose S-layers often contain surface layer homology (SLH) domains, the binding occurs to the peptidoglycan and to a secondary cell wall polymer (e.g., teichoic acids). In the absence of SLH domains, the binding occurs via electrostatic interactions between the positively charged N-terminus of the S-layer protein and a negatively charged secondary cell wall polymer. In Lactobacilli the binding domain may be located at the C-terminus.
* In Gram-negative archaea, S-layer proteins possess a hydrophobic anchor that is associated with the underlying lipid membrane.
* In Gram-positive archaea, the S-layer proteins bind to pseudomurein or to methanochondroitin.

== Biological functions of the S-layer ==
For many bacteria, the S-layer represents the outermost interaction zone with their respective environment. Its functions are very diverse and vary from species to species. In many archaeal species the S-layer is the only cell wall component and, therefore, is important for mechanical and osmotic stabilization. The S-layer is considered to be porous, which contributes to many of its functions. Additional functions associated with S-layers include:
* protection against bacteriophages, Bdellovibrios, and phagocytosis
* resistance against low pH
* barrier against high-molecular-weight substances (e.g., lytic enzymes)
* adhesion (for glycosylated S-layers)
* stabilization of the membrane (e.g. the SDBC in &quot;Deinococcus radiodurans&quot;) 
* resistance against electromagnetic stress (e.g. ionizing radiations and high temperatures) 
* provision of adhesion sites for exoproteins
* provision of a periplasmic compartment in Gram-positive prokaryotes together with the peptidoglycan and the cytoplasmic membranes
* anti-fouling properties
* biomineralization
* molecular sieve and barrier function
A great example of a bacterium which utilizes the biological functions of the S-layer is &quot;Clostridioides difficile.&quot; In &quot;C. difficile&quot;, the S-layer has helped with biofilm formation, host cell adhesion, and immunomodulation through cell signaling of the host response.

==S-layer structure ==
While ubiquitous among Archaea, and common in bacteria, the S-layers of diverse organisms have unique structural properties, including symmetry and unit cell dimensions, due to fundamental differences in their constituent building blocks. Sequence analyses of S-layer proteins have predicted that S-layer proteins have sizes of 40-200 kDa and may be composed of multiple domains some of which may be structurally related. Since the first evidence of a macromolecular array on a bacterial cell wall fragment in the 1950s S-layer structure has been investigated extensively by electron microscopy and medium resolution images of S-layers from these analyses has provided useful information on overall S-layer morphology. High-resolution structures of an archaeal S-layer protein (MA0829 from &quot;Methanosarcina acetivorans&quot; C2A) of the Methanosarcinales S-layer Tile Protein family and a bacterial S-layer protein (SbsB), from &quot;Geobacillus stearothermophilus&quot; PV72, have recently been determined by X-ray crystallography. In contrast with existing crystal structures, which have represented individual domains of S-layer proteins or minor proteinaceous components of the S-layer, the MA0829 and SbsB structures have allowed high resolution models of the &quot;M&quot;. &quot;acetivorans&quot; and &quot;G&quot;. &quot;stearothermophilus&quot; S-layers to be proposed. These models exhibit hexagonal (p6) and oblique (p2) symmetry, for &quot;M&quot;. &quot;acetivorans&quot; and &quot;G&quot;. &quot;stearothermophilus&quot; S-layers, respectively, and their molecular features, including dimensions and porosity, are in good agreement with data from electron microscopy studies of archaeal and bacterial S-layers.

In general, S-layers exhibit either oblique (p1, p2), square (p4) or hexagonal (p3, p6) lattice symmetry. Depending on the lattice symmetry, each morphological unit of the S-layer is composed of one (p1), two (p2), three (p3), four (p4), or six (p6) identical protein subunits. The center-to-center spacing (or unit cell dimensions) between these subunits range from 4 to 35 nm.

== Self-assembly ==

=== In vivo assembly ===
Assembly of a highly ordered coherent monomolecular S-layer array on a growing cell surface requires a continuous synthesis of a surplus of S-layer proteins and their translocation to sites of lattice growth. Moreover, information concerning this dynamic process were obtained from reconstitution experiments with isolated S-layer subunits on cell surfaces from which they had been removed (homologous reattachment) or on those of other organisms (heterologous reattachment).

=== In vitro assembly ===
S-layer proteins have the natural capability to self-assemble into regular monomolecular arrays in solution and at interfaces, such as solid supports, the air-water interface, lipid films, liposomes, emulsomes, nanocapsules, nanoparticles or micro beads. S-layer crystal growth follows a non-classical pathway in which a final refolding step of the S-layer protein is part of the lattice formation.

== Application ==
Native S-layer proteins have already been used three decades ago in the development of biosensors and ultrafiltration membranes. Subsequently, S-layer fusion proteins with specific functional domains (e.g. enzymes, ligands, mimotopes, antibodies or antigens) allowed to investigate completely new strategies for functionalizing surfaces in the life sciences, such as in the development of novel affinity matrices, mucosal vaccines, biocompatible surfaces, micro carriers and encapsulation systems, or in the material sciences as templates for biomineralization.

<text>Lawyer Marzell Milloy (born November 14, 1973) is an American former professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons. He played college football for the Washington Huskies, and earned unanimous All-American honors. He was selected by the New England Patriots in the second round of the 1996 NFL draft, and also played for the Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Falcons, and Seattle Seahawks of the NFL. He was a four-time Pro Bowl selection, a two-time All-Pro, and a member of the Patriots&#x27; Super Bowl XXXVI championship team that beat his hometown team, the St. Louis Rams.

==College career==
Milloy attended the University of Washington in Seattle, where he played for the Huskies under head coach Jim Lambright from 1993 to 1995. He was the only sophomore in the Pacific-10 Conference to earn all-conference honors in 1994 as he led UW and finished third in the Pac-10 with 106 tackles (67 solos); he became the first Husky defensive back to lead the team in tackles since Tony Bonwell recorded 142 tackles in 1972, and he was also credited with an interception, two forced fumbles and one recovered fumble. Milloy started all year at free safety as a junior, leading the team in tackles for the second consecutive season with 115 stops, in addition to tallying three forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, and one interception. He was recognized as a unanimous All-American in 1995, having earned first-team honors from the Associated Press, the Walter Camp Foundation, UPI, the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and the &quot;Football News&quot;. Milloy also earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors and was awarded the Jim Thorpe Award in 1995.

Milloy was drafted by the Cleveland Indians as a pitching prospect out of high school and lettered three seasons in baseball at Washington. He was later selected in the 1995 draft, by the Detroit Tigers in the 19th round. In 1994, the Huskies advanced to the NCAA regional finals (Sweet 16), one round from the College World Series, but lost two straight in Wichita to Georgia Tech, led by future major leaguers Jason Varitek and Nomar Garciaparra.

==Professional career==
During the pre-draft process, Milloy met with the New England Patriots&#x27; secondary coach Bill Belichick. 
Milloy was projected to be a first or second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was considered to be one of the top three safety prospects available in the draft, along with Memphis safety Jerome Woods and Texas Tech safety Marcus Coleman.

===New England Patriots===
The New England Patriots selected Milloy in the second round (36th overall) of the 1996 NFL draft. Milloy was the second safety drafted in 1996, behind Memphis safety Jerome Woods (28th overall).

====1996====
Throughout training camp, Milloy competed to be the starting strong safety against Terry Ray. Milloy impressed the Patriots&#x27; coaching staff during the preseason and was able to make a case for the starting role. Defensive backs coach Bill Belichick lobbied for Milloy to be the starter, but head coach Bill Parcells opted to name Terry Ray the starting strong safety to begin the regular season instead.

He made his professional regular season debut in the New England Patriots&#x27; 24–10 loss at the Miami Dolphins. On September 15, 1996, Milloy recorded five combined tackles during a 31–0 win against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3. Milloy made his first career tackle on Cardinals&#x27; wide receiver Frank Sanders in the second quarter. Milloy surpassed Terry Ray on the depth chart and earned the starting strong safety position after Week 7. On October 20, 1996, Milloy earned his first career start and recorded seven combined tackles and forced the first fumble of his career in the Patriots&#x27; 27–9 win at the Indianapolis Colts in Week 8. On November 17, 1996, Milloy collected a season-high 12 combined tackles and made his first career interception during a 34–8 loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 12. Milloy made his first career interception off a pass by Broncos&#x27; quarterback John Elway, that was originally intended for running back Terrell Davis, and returned it for a 14-yard gain in the third quarter. In Week 15, he recorded three combined tackles and made his first career sack during a 34–10 win against the New York Jets. Milloy made his first career sack on Jets&#x27; backup quarterback Glenn Foley for a seven-yard loss in the third quarter. He finished his rookie season in 1996 with 82 combined tackles, two interceptions, two forced fumbles, and a sack in 16 games and ten starts.

The New England Patriots finished first in the AFC East with an 11–5 record and earned a first-round bye. On January 5, 1997, Milloy started in his first career playoff game and made five combined tackles and an interception as the Patriots defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 28–3 in the AFC Divisional Round. Milloy intercepted a pass by Steelers&#x27; quarterback Mike Tomczak, that was intended for wide receiver Andre Hastings, in the third quarter. The following week, he made seven combined tackles as the Patriots defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 20–6 in the AFC Championship Game. On January 26, 1997, Milloy played in Super Bowl XXXI and recorded eight tackles during the Patriots&#x27; 35–21 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

====1997====
On February 11, 1997, it was reported that New England Patriots&#x27; head coach Bill Parcells had accepted the General Manager/Head coaching position with the New York Jets after both teams agreed to a deal. Head coach Pete Carroll named Milloy the starting strong safety to start the regular season, alongside free safety Willie Clay and cornerbacks Jimmy Hitchcock and Ty Law. On November 16, 1997, Milloy collected a season-high 12 combined tackles during a 27–7 at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 12. The following week, he tied his season-high of 12 combined tackles as the Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins 27–24 in Week 13. He started in all 16 games in 1997 and recorded 112 combined tackles, 
three interceptions, and forced two fumbles.

The New England Patriots finished atop the AFC East with a 10–6 record in their first season under Pete Carroll. On January 3, 1998, Milloy recorded ten combined tackles in the Patriots&#x27; 7–6 loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Divisional Round.

====1998====
Head coach Pete Carroll retained Milloy and Willie Clay as the starting safeties in 1998. On September 20, 1998, Milloy recorded nine combined tackles and returned an interception for his first career touchdown during a 27–16 win against the Tennessee Oilers in Week 3. Milloy intercepted a pass by Oilers&#x27; quarterback Steve McNair, that was intended for Yancy Thigpen, and returned it for a 30-yard touchdown to seal the Patriots&#x27; victory in the fourth quarter. In Week 16, he collected a season-high 14 combined tackles during a 24–21 win against the San Francisco 49ers. He started all 16 games in 1998 and recorded 120 combined tackles, a career-high six interceptions, a sack, and a touchdown. Milloy was selected to the 1999 Pro Bowl which marked the first Pro Bowl selection of his career.

====1999====
Head coach Pete Carroll named Milloy and Chris Carter the starting safeties in 1999, alongside cornerbacks Ty Law and Steve Israel.
On October 24, 1999, Milloy collected a season-high 14 combined tackles during a 24–23 win against the Denver Broncos in Week 7. Milloy started in all 16 games in 1999 and recorded 120 combined tackles, made four interceptions, and two sacks. Milloy was selected to the 2000 Pro Bowl and was widely regarded as the top safety in the league during the season.

====2000====
On January 3, 2000, the New England Patriots fired head coach Pete Carroll after the Patriots finished with an 8–8 record the previous season. On January 27, 2000, the New England Patriots announced former New York Jets&#x27; defensive coordinator Bill Belichick as their new head coach. The Patriots traded three draft picks to the New York Jets in order to hire Belichick who was supposed to be the successor at head coach for the New York Jets after Bill Parcells. Belichick was Milloy&#x27;s position coach as a rookie and was instrumental in the Patriots&#x27; decision to draft Milloy in 1996. Milloy was asked about Belichick by Patriots&#x27; owner Robert Kraft and stated he admired him and highly recommended Kraft hire him as the new head coach as he thought Belichick could be a great coach and could take the organization where it needed to go. Belichick also served as defensive coordinator in 2001 and hired Eric Mangini to be the defensive backs coach.

On February 10, 2000, the New England Patriots signed Milloy to a seven-year, $35 million contract that included a signing bonus of $6 million. His contract made him the highest paid safety in the league.

Head coach Bill Belichick named Milloy the starting strong safety to start the season, alongside free safety Tebucky Jones. On November 19, 2000, Milloy collected a season-high 13 combined tackles, forced a fumble, and also made an interception during the Patriots&#x27; 16–13 win against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 12. Milloy intercepted a pass by Bengals&#x27; quarterback Scott Mitchell, that was intended for tight end Tony McGee, and returned it for two-yards before being tackled by offensive tackle Willie Anderson. He started in all 16 games in 2000 and made a total of 117 combined tackles, three forced fumbles, and two interceptions.

====2001====
The New England Patriots hired former Cleveland Browns&#x27; defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel as their defensive coordinator in 2001. Crennel opted to retain Milloy and Tebucky Jones as the starting safeties. Milloy and Jones started alongside cornerbacks Ty Law and Otis Smith in 2001.

In Week 6, he collected a season-high ten combined tackles (nine solo) during a 38–17 victory at the Indianapolis Colts. On November 25, 2001, Milloy tied a season-high of ten combined tackles (five solo), deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass by Saints&#x27; quarterback Aaron Brooks as the Patriots defeated the New Orleans Saints 34–17 in Week 11. In Week 14, he recorded a game-high eight combined tackles, broke up a pass, and made an interception off a pass by Bills&#x27; quarterback Alex Van Pelt during a 12–9 overtime victory at Buffalo Bills. Milloy was selected to play in the 2002 Pro Bowl, which became his third Pro Bowl selection. Milloy started in all 16 games in 2001 and recorded 113 combined tackles (77 solo), three sacks, three pass deflections, and two interceptions.

The New England Patriots finished atop the AFC East with an 11–5 record and earned a first round bye. Milloy recorded five combined tackles as the Patriots began their playoff run by defeating the Oakland Raiders 16–13 in the AFC Divisional Round. On January 27, 2002, Milloy recorded three solo tackles, deflected a pass and made an interception during a 24–17 win at the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. Milloy intercepted a pass by Steelers&#x27; quarterback Kordell Stewart, that was originally intended for wide receiver Plaxico Burress, and sealed the Patriots&#x27; victory in the fourth quarter. On February 3, 2002, Milloy started in Super Bowl XXXVI and recorded seven combined tackles and led the team with three pass deflections as the Patriots defeated the St. Louis Rams 20–17. Milloy earned his first and only Super Bowl ring of his career.

====2002====
Head coach Bill Belichick retained the starting secondary in 2002. On December 16, 2002, Milloy collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (nine solo) during a 24–7 loss at the Tennessee Titans in Week 15. He started in all 16 games in 2002 and recorded 94 combined tackles (65 solo) and five pass deflections. He was selected in the 2003 Pro Bowl, which became his fourth and last Pro Bowl selection of his career.

====2003====
On September 2, 2003, the New England Patriots released Milloy after he declined to take a pay cut to remain with the team. The Patriots cleared $5.86 million in cap space for 2003 with his release. Milloy was supposed to earn $4.50 million in 2003 and still had four years remaining on his contract. Milloy wasn&#x27;t scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent until after the 2006 season.
===Buffalo Bills===
On September 3, 2003, the Buffalo Bills signed Milloy to a four-year, $15 million contract that included a signing bonus of $5 million.

Head coach Gregg Williams named Milloy the starting strong safety to start the regular season, alongside starting free safety Izell Reese and cornerbacks Nate Clements and Antoine Winfield.

His first game with the Buffalo Bills took place five days after his release against his former team, the New England Patriots. He finished the Bills&#x27; 31–0 victory with five combined tackles and sacked Patriots&#x27; quarterback Tom Brady. On December 14, 2003, Milloy collected a season-high 14 combined tackles (12 solo) during a 28–26 loss at the Tennessee Titans in Week 15. On December 30, 2003, the Buffalo Bills fired head coach Gregg Williams after they finished the 2003 season with a 6–10 record. He started all 16 games in 2003 NFL season and recorded 104 combined tackles (69 solo), eight pass deflections, three sacks, and two forced fumbles. Milloy also extended his consecutive starts streak to 122 games.

====2004====
Head coach Mike Mularkey named Milloy the starting strong safety to begin the season, alongside free safety Izell Reese and cornerbacks Terrence McGee and Nate Clements. On August 28, 2004, Milloy broke his forearm during a 30–17 loss at the Indianapolis Colts in their third preseason game. Milloy was inactive for the Buffalo Bills&#x27; first five games (Weeks 1–6) due to his broken forearm. On November 14, 2004, he collected a season-high 15 combined tackles (ten solo) during a 29–6 loss at the New England Patriots in Week 10. The following week, Milloy recorded six solo tackles and made a career-high three sacks on Rams&#x27; quarterback Marc Bulger during the Bills&#x27; 37–17 win against the St. Louis Rams in Week 11. He started all 11 games he was active and recorded 61 combined tackles (39 solo), five pass deflections, four sacks, and two interceptions.

In Week 10, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (nine solo) during the Bills&#x27; 14–3 win against the Kansas City Chiefs. Milloy started in all 16 games in 2005 and recorded 106 combined tackles (75 solo), four pass deflections, a sack, and an interception.

====2006====
On March 1, 2006, the Buffalo Bills released Milloy and defensive tackle Sam Adams in a salary cap purge that freed up an estimated $9.1 million in cap space. Milloy was set to account for $3.75 million in salary cap space in 2006. Milloy visited the Cincinnati Bengals, Seattle Seahawks, and Atlanta Falcons during free agency.

===Atlanta Falcons===
On March 17, 2006, the Atlanta Falcons signed Milloy to a three-year, $6.01 million contract that included a signing bonus of $2.50 million. Head coach Jim Mora named Milloy the starting strong safety to start the regular season, alongside free safety Chris Crocker and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Jimmy Williams.

On October 15, 2006, Milloy collected a season-high 11 combined tackles (nine solo) during a 27–14 loss to the New York Giants in Week 6. He started in all 16 games in 2006 and recorded 98 combined tackles (72 solo), five pass deflections, and two sacks.

====2007====
On January 2, 2007, the Atlanta Falcons fired head coach Jim Mora after the Falcons did not qualify for the playoffs and finished with a 7–9 record in 2006. Head coach Bobby Petrino retained Milloy and Chris Crocker as the starting safety duo in 2007. They started in the secondary alongside cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Houston.

In Week 6, he collected a season-high 11 solo tackles in the Falcons&#x27; 31–10 win against the New York Giants.

====2009====
On September 6, 2009, the Seattle Seahawks signed Milloy to a one-year, $845,000 contract. Head coach Jim L. Mora named Milloy the backup free safety, behind Jordan Babineaux, to start the regular season. On December 27, 2009, Milloy collected a season-high six combined tackles in the Seahawks&#x27; 48–10 loss at the Green Bay Packers in Week 16. Milloy finished the 2009 season with 34 combined tackles (27 solo) and two pass deflections in 16 games and one start.

====2010====
On April 30, 2010, the Seattle Seahawks signed Milloy to a one-year, $845,000 contract. Head coach Pete Carroll named Milloy the starting strong safety to begin the regular season in 2010, alongside free safety Earl Thomas and cornerbacks Marcus Trufant and Kelly Jennings. In Week 3, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (seven solo) during a 27–20 win against the San Diego Chargers. On October 17, 2010, Milloy recorded three solo tackles and a season-high two sacks during the Seahawks&#x27; 29–20 win at the Chicago Bears in Week 6. His two sacks against the Bears earned him a spot in the 20/20 club. Milloy started in all 16 games in 2010 and recorded 88 combined tackles (67 solo), four sacks, three pass deflections, and a forced fumble.

The Seattle Seahawks finished first in the NFC West with a 7–9 record and earned home-field advantage in the wild-card round of the playoffs. The Seahawks upset the favored New Orleans Saints 41–36 in the NFC Wildcard Game. On January 16, 2011, Milloy recorded seven solo tackles as the Seahawks were defeated 35–24 at the Chicago Bears in the NFC Divisional Round. Despite interest in returning, Milloy was not re-signed by the Seahawks for the 2011 season, due to the emergence of 2010 draft picks Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor.

<doc id="961340" wikidata="Q5329168" url="?curid=961340" title="East Point Business Park">
<text>East Point Office Park () in the docklands area of Dublin, Ireland is one of the country&#x27;s largest business parks, being the place of employment for thousands of people. It is situated in the East Wall area on reclaimed land.

There are over 50 companies in the park with 6,000 employees.

==History==

The park is situated on land reclaimed from Dublin Bay and the River Tolka estuary. The first phase of the park was opened for business around 1996. 
The site where EastPoint is located was intended to be a location for a new City Airport in Dublin, similar to London City Airport. When this plan ultimately proved impractical, the site was acquired by Earlsfort Centre Developments.

Earlsfort engaged Scott Tallon Walker to design the Park and the buildings and the landscaping was designed by Charles Funke.
It became necessary, because of the route of the Dublin Port Tunnel, to construct a new bridge and causeway from Alfie Byrne Road to access the Park.

The success of the initial phase of EastPoint led to Earlsfort and Dublin Port Company entering a joint venture to develop a further phase. This brought the size of the Park to Circa with Circa 140,000 square meters (1.5 m square feet) of mainly offices in 37 buildings. This also provided a further entrance to the Park from Bond Road thus enhancing access from the South City.

==Major companies==

Major companies based in East Point Office Park include among others Cisco, Google, Oracle, Enterprise Ireland, Deutsche Bank, Cloud Software Group, QuintilesIms, Ergo, FINEOS and Virgin Media Ireland.

Enterprise Ireland leased one of the buildings within the park to serve as its new head office, in a move aimed at merging its four Dublin offices together at one central location, from the end of 2007.

==Location and transport==

EastPoint is Dublin&#x27;s only central office park, located less than 2 kilometres from the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), the purpose-built Convention Centre Dublin overlooking the River Liffey, and other landmarks such as the 3Arena (formerly known as The O2) venue at the Point Village.

The park is not served directly by any public transport. To alleviate this, a shuttle bus fleet provide free-of-charge service to Clontarf Road railway station during railway operating hours; and to near the Point Village stop on the Luas red line during peak hours.

<text>Hurricane Ivan was a large, long-lived, and devastating tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in the Caribbean and United States. The ninth named storm, the sixth hurricane, and the fourth major hurricane of the active 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, Ivan formed in early September and reached Category 5 strength on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS). Ivan caused catastrophic damage in Grenada as a strong Category 3 storm, heavy damage in Jamaica as a strong Category 4 storm, and then severe damage in Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands, and the western tip of Cuba as a Category 5 hurricane. After peaking in strength, the hurricane moved north-northwest across the Gulf of Mexico to strike Pensacola/Milton, Florida and Alabama as a strong Category 3 storm, causing significant damage. Ivan dropped heavy rain on the Southeastern United States as it progressed northeastward and eastward through the Eastern United States, becoming an extratropical cyclone on September 18. The remnant low of the storm moved into the western subtropical Atlantic and regenerated into a tropical cyclone on September 22, which then moved across Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, and then into Louisiana and Texas, causing minimal damage. Ivan degenerated into a remnant low on September 24, before dissipating on the next day.

Ivan caused an estimated US$26.1 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damage along its path, of which $20.5 billion occurred in the United States.

==Meteorological history==
On September 2, 2004, Tropical Depression Nine formed from a large tropical wave southwest of Cape Verde. As the system moved to the west, it strengthened gradually, becoming Tropical Storm Ivan on September 3, and reaching hurricane strength on September 5, to the east of Tobago. Later that day, the storm intensified rapidly, and by 5 p.m. EDT (UTC−4), Ivan became a Category 4 hurricane with winds of . The National Hurricane Center said that the rapid strengthening of Ivan on September 5 was unprecedented at such a low latitude in the Atlantic basin.
As it moved west, Ivan weakened slightly because of wind shear in the area. The storm passed over Grenada on September 7, battering several of the Windward Islands. As it entered the Caribbean Sea, Ivan reintensified rapidly and became a Category 5 hurricane, just north of the Windward Netherlands Antilles (Curaçao and Bonaire) and Aruba on September 9, with winds reaching . Ivan weakened slightly as it moved west-northwest towards Jamaica. As Ivan approached the island late on September 10, it began a westward jog that kept the eye and the strongest winds to the south and west. However, because of its proximity to the Jamaican coast, the island was battered with hurricane-force winds for hours.

After passing Cuba, Ivan resumed a more northerly track and regained Category 5 strength. Ivan&#x27;s strength continued to fluctuate as it moved west on September 11, and the storm attained its highest 1-minute maximum sustained winds of as it passed within of Grand Cayman. Ivan reached its peak strength with a minimum central pressure of on September 12. Ivan passed through the Yucatán Channel late on September 13, while its eyewall affected the westernmost tip of Cuba. Once over the Gulf of Mexico, Ivan weakened slightly to Category 4 strength, which it maintained while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. When Ivan entered the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory ocean-floor pressure sensors detected a freak wave, which was caused by the hurricane. The wave was around high from peak to trough, and around long. Their computer models also indicated that waves may have exceeded in the eyewall.
Just before it made landfall in the United States, Ivan&#x27;s eyewall weakened considerably, and its southwestern portion almost disappeared. Around 2 a.m. CDT (UTC−5) on September 16, Ivan made landfall on the U.S. mainland in Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 3 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained winds of . Some hurricane information sources put the winds from Hurricane Ivan near (Category 4) upon landfall in Alabama and northwestern Florida. Ivan then continued inland, maintaining hurricane strength until it was over central Alabama. Ivan weakened rapidly that evening and became a tropical depression on the same day, still over Alabama. Ivan lost tropical characteristics on September 18 while crossing Virginia, becoming an extratropical storm. Later that day, the remnant low of Ivan drifted off the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast into the Atlantic Ocean, and the low-pressure disturbance continued to dump rain on the United States.

On September 20, Ivan&#x27;s remnant surface low completed an anticyclonic loop and moved across the Florida peninsula. As it continued westward across the northern Gulf of Mexico, the system reorganized and again took on tropical characteristics on September 22. On September 22, the National Weather Service, &quot;after considerable and sometimes animated in-house discussion [regarding] the demise of Ivan,&quot; determined that the low was in fact a result of the remnants of Ivan and thus named it accordingly. On the evening of September 23, the revived Ivan made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana as a tropical depression. Ivan weakened into a remnant low on September 24, as it moved overland into Texas. The remnant circulation of Ivan persisted for another day, before dissipating on September 25.

===Records===

Ivan set 18 new records for intensity at low latitudes. When Ivan initially became a Category 1 hurricane on September 3, it was centered 9.5 degrees north from the equator. This is farthest south position on record for a hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Later that day (6 p.m. UTC), when Ivan became a Category 3 hurricane, it was centered near 10.2 degrees north from the equator. This is the most southerly location on record for a major hurricane in the Atlantic basin. Just six hours later, Ivan also became the most southerly Category 4 hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin when it reached that intensity while located at 10.6 degrees north. Finally, at midnight (UTC) on September 9 while centered at 13.7 degrees north, Ivan became the most southerly Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin. The latter record would not be surpassed until Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which reached Category 5 intensity at 13.4 degrees north.

Ivan had held the world record of 33 (with 32 consecutive) six-hour periods of intensity at or above Category 4 strength. This record was broken two years later by Pacific Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke, which had 36 (33 consecutive) six-hour periods at Category 4 strength. This contributed to Ivan&#x27;s total Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) of 70.38. The tornado outbreak associated with Ivan spawned 127 tornadoes, more than any other tropical cyclone worldwide.

Scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory at Stennis Space Center, Mississippi have used a computer model to predict that, at the height of the storm, the maximum wave height within Ivan&#x27;s eyewall reached .

==Preparations==
===Caribbean===
By September 5, a hurricane watch was posted for Barbados. Early on the following day, a tropical storm watch was issued for Grenada. Later that day, hurricane watches were also put into effect for Saint Lucia, and Martinique. A tropical storm warning was issued for Saint Vincent and Grenadines and Tobago and Grenada. By 3 p.m. UTC on September 6, the hurricane watches and tropical storm watches and warnings were upgraded to a hurricane warning and expanded to: Barbados, Saint Vincent and Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Tobago, and Grenada. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued for Trinidad. On September 7, the hurricane warning in effect for several countries was downgraded to a tropical storm warning. By September, all tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued in the eastern portions of the Windward Islands.

As Ivan continued westward, a hurricane watch was issued for the ABC islands on September 8. Many schools and businesses were closed in the Netherlands Antilles, and about 300 people evacuated their homes on Curaçao.

In the Caribbean, 500,000 Jamaicans were told to evacuate from coastal areas, but only 5,000 were reported to have moved to shelters. 12,000 residents and tourists were evacuated from Isla Mujeres off the Yucatán Peninsula.

=== United States ===
In Louisiana, mandatory evacuations of vulnerable areas in Jefferson, Lafourche, Plaquemines, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, and Tangipahoa parishes took place, with voluntary evacuations ordered in six other parishes. More than one-third of the population of Greater New Orleans evacuated voluntarily, including more than half of the residents of New Orleans itself. At the height of the evacuation, intense traffic congestion on local highways caused delays of up to 12 hours. About a thousand special-needs patients were housed at the Louisiana Superdome during the storm. Ivan was considered a particular threat to the New Orleans area because dangers of catastrophic flooding. However, Plaquemines and St. Bernard Parishes suffered a moderate amount of wind damage. Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans was judged poor. At one point, the media sparked fears of an &quot;Atlantean&quot; catastrophe if the hurricane were to make a direct strike on the city. These fears were not realized, as the storm&#x27;s path turned further east.

In Mississippi, evacuation of mobile homes and vulnerable areas took place in Hancock, Jackson, and Harrison counties. In Alabama, evacuation in the areas of Mobile and Baldwin counties south of Interstate 10 was ordered, including a third of the incorporated territory of the City of Mobile, as well as several of its suburbs. In Florida, a full evacuation of the Florida Keys began at 7 a.m. EDT September 10 but was lifted at 5 a.m. EDT September 13 as Ivan tracked further west than originally predicted. Voluntary evacuations were declared in ten counties along the Florida Panhandle, with strong emphasis in the immediate western counties of Escambia, Santa Rosa, and Okaloosa. Ivan prompted the evacuation of 270 animals at the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The evacuation had to be completed within a couple of hours, with only 28 volunteers available to move the animals.

On September 9, while the hurricane was located off the coast of Venezuela, the National Hurricane Center forecasted Ivan to make landfall in southern Florida as a major hurricane within five days. As such, a mandatory evacuation was issued for all residents and visitors of the Florida Keys. According to newspaper reports, an estimated 50 percent of Monroe County residents evacuated the islands. Its forecast track shifted westward, and by September 10 it was predicted to pass near the Florida Keys before moving ashore near Cedar Key after paralleling the state&#x27;s western coastline; however, uncertainty was noted. On September 12, a tropical storm watch was issued for the Florida Keys from the Dry Tortugas to Seven Mile Bridge.

In the several days prior to Ivan making its first United States landfall, forecasters predicted Ivan to move ashore between Alabama and the western Florida panhandle. On September 13, in response to Hurricane Ivan, a state of emergency was issued for Alabama by Governor Bob Riley. This led to a law against price gouging becoming effective immediately. Mandatory evacuations for Dauphin Island, Gulf Shores, Orange Beach, and Fort Morgan were issued the morning of September 14. Hours later, evacuations in the areas of Mobile and Baldwin counties south of Interstate 10 was ordered, including a third of the incorporated territory of the City of Mobile, as well as several of its suburbs. As a result of the evacuations, all lanes on I-65 were rerouted to go north, successfully allowing more people to leave South Alabama. Ivan prompted the evacuation of 270 animals at the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo in Gulf Shores, Alabama. The evacuation had to be completed within a couple of hours, with only 28 volunteers available to move the animals. A hurricane watch was issued for the entire coastline of Alabama around 51 hours before landfall, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning around 42 hours before landfall. A soccer match in Tuscaloosa between the University of Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham was postponed to a later date.
==Impact==
Ivan killed 64 people in the Caribbean—mainly in Grenada and Jamaica—three in Venezuela, and 25 in the United States, including fourteen in Florida. Thirty-two more deaths in the United States were indirectly attributed to Ivan. While traversing the eastern United States, Ivan spawned 120 tornadoes, striking communities along concentric arcs on the leading edge of the storm. In Florida, Blountstown, Marianna, and Panama City Beach suffered three of the most devastating tornadoes. A Panama City Beach news station was nearly hit by an F2 tornado during the storm. Ivan also caused over $20.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in damages in the United States and $3 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) in the Caribbean.

===Southeastern Caribbean and Venezuela===
Ivan was a large-sized and major hurricane upon moving through the Windward Islands, battering structures, uprooting trees and causing power outages across much of the island chain. Even though it passed well south of Barbados on September 6, potent winds damaged 531 homes to varying degree, while one person drowned due to flooding. Monetary losses on the island surmounted $5 million. The worst of Ivan occurred in Grenada, when it passed directly over the island on September 7 with winds of over . The island, in the words of a Caribbean disaster official, suffered &quot;total devastation.&quot; At least 89% of the small island—or 28,000 of 31,000 homes—experienced damage. The capital, St. George&#x27;s, was severely damaged and several notable buildings were destroyed, including two largest hospitals in Grenada. In all, 41 people lost their lives during the hurricane, damage on the island totaled $830.7 million (equivalent to $ in ), primarily to housing.

Lighter effects occurred in Trinidad and Tobago, with most of the damage confined to the smaller island of Tobago. Twenty villages on that island suffered various forms of damage, and at least 45 homes lost their roofs. One person died from a fallen tree, and damage was estimated at $4.9 million. Further north, large waves and high storm surge battered the coastlines of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, washing away 2 homes, destroying 19 and damaging 40. Significant damage was reported to local banana crop, and losses for the country totaled $40 million. Strong winds and rough surf affected southern portions of Saint Lucia, inflicting $2.6 million worth in damage to homes and crops. High waves from Ivan caused light damage to southwestern Martinique and Guadeloupe, and gale-force winds buffeted Dominica.

As Ivan continued to strengthen, it proceeded about north of the ABC Islands on September 9. High winds blew away roof shingles and produced large swells that battered several coastal facilities. A developing spiral band dropped heavy rainfall over Aruba, causing flooding and $1.1 million worth in structural damage.

===Jamaica===

On September 11–12, the center of Ivan passed near Jamaica, causing significant wind and flood damage. Overall, 17 people were killed in Jamaica and 18,000 people were left homeless as a result of the flood waters and high winds. Most of the major resorts and hotels fared well, though, and were reopened only a few days after Ivan had passed. Damage on Jamaica totaled $360 million (equivalent to $ in ).

===Cayman Islands===

In the Cayman Islands, Governor Bruce Dinwiddy described damage as &quot;very, very severe and widespread.&quot; Despite strict building codes which made the islands&#x27; buildings well able to withstand even major hurricanes, Ivan&#x27;s winds and storm surge were so strong that a quarter or more of the buildings on the islands were reported to be uninhabitable, with 85% damaged to some extent. Much of Grand Cayman still remained without power, water, or sewer services for several months later. After five months, barely half the pre-Ivan hotel rooms were usable. Two people were killed on Grand Cayman, one from drowning and the other from flying debris. Damage across the territory was catastrophic, with losses amounting to $2.86 billion (equivalent to $ in ) or 183 percent of its gross domestic product. The Letter from the Cayman Islands Government Office in the United Kingdom, October 8, 2004, by McKeeva Bush, Leader of Government Business details the intensity, extent of damage, and recovery process during the months that followed.

===Elsewhere in the Caribbean===
There were four deaths in the Dominican Republic. The region&#x27;s Caribbean Development Bank estimates Ivan caused over $3 billion ($ in ) damage on island nations, mostly in the Cayman Islands, Grenada, and Jamaica. Minor damage, including some beach erosion, was reported in the ABC islands.

Even though Ivan did not make landfall on Cuban soil, its storm surge caused localized flooding on Santiago de Cuba and Granma, on the southern part of the island. At Cienfuegos, the storm produced waves of , and Pinar del Río recorded of rainfall. While there were no casualties on the island, the Cuban government estimates that about $1.2 billion ($ in  USD) of property damage were directly due to Ivan.

===United States===

Along with the 14 deaths in Florida, Ivan is blamed for eight deaths in North Carolina, two in Georgia, and one in Mississippi. An additional 32 deaths were reported as indirectly caused by the storm.

As it passed over the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana, Ivan caused the destruction of Taylor Energy&#x27;s Mississippi Canyon 20-A production platform, above 28 producing oil and gas wells drilled in water deep. Waves estimated to be caused tremendous pressures below the surface, causing a landslide that obliterated the platform. Hundreds of gallons of oil per day were still leaking onto the surface of the Gulf fourteen years later. The United States Coast Guard reported that the spill had been contained in 2019.

Ivan caused an estimated $20.5 billion (equivalent to $ in ) in damage in the United States alone, making it the second-costliest hurricane on record at the time, behind only Hurricane Andrew of 1992.

====Florida====
As Ivan made landfall on the U.S. coastline in eastern Alabama, the outer rainbands of Ivan produced a wind gust of on Key West; the winds downed some tree limbs across the Florida Keys, though the number of downed trees was limited by the passage of previous hurricanes Charley and Frances. While passing west of the area, the hurricane produced a storm tide. The mandatory evacuations prevented the delivery of products, which caused widespread fuel and food shortages at commercial establishments. There was heavy damage as observed in Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, Navarre Beach, and Pensacola Beach. Dwellings situated far inland, as much as from the Gulf coast, along the shorelines of Escambia Bay, East Bay, Blackwater Bay, and Ward Basin in Escambia County and Santa Rosa County, and Fort Walton Beach, Florida on the eastern side of the storm. The area just west of Pensacola, including the community of Warrington (which includes Pensacola NAS), Perdido Key, and Innerarity Point, took the brunt of the storm. Some of the subdivisions in this part of the county were completely destroyed, with a few key roads in the Perdido area only opened in late 2005, over a year after the storm hit. Shattered windows from gusts and flying projectiles experienced throughout the night of the storm were common. As of December 2007, roads remained closed on Pensacola Beach because of damage from Ivan&#x27;s storm surge.

In Pensacola, the Interstate 10 Escambia Bay Bridge was heavily damaged, with as much as a quarter-mile (400 m) of the bridge collapsing into the bay. The causeway that carries U.S. Highway 90 across the northern part of the same bay was also heavily damaged. The U.S. 90 causeway reopened first; the I-10 bridge reopened, with temporary repairs, in November. Virtually all of Perdido Key, an area on the outskirts of Pensacola that bore the brunt of Ivan&#x27;s winds and rain, was essentially leveled. High surf and wind brought extensive damage to Innerarity Point.

As the storm moved through the region, an important Major League Baseball series between the Florida Marlins and Montreal Expos was moved to U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. In addition, the season opener between the Tennessee Titans and Miami Dolphins was moved forward a day due to the storm.

On September 26, 2006, over two years after Ivan struck the region, funding for the last 501 FEMA-provided trailers ran out for those living in Santa Rosa and Escambia counties.

====Alabama====

When the hurricane hit it brought strong winds and rain. In Baldwin County, a gust with winds of was reported, along with a storm surge ranging from 16 to 29 feet (5–9 meters) high, and a peak of 10.16 inches (258.064 millimeters) of rainfall. Thousands of homes in Escambia, Baldwin County, and Mobile County were damaged or destroyed. In Orange Beach, 60 percent of all wooden structures were damaged. During the peak of the storm, 825,000 customers lost power. Major damage was reported at the Gulf Shore Zoo, and despite efforts to evacuate all animals, several deers and six alligators escaped after their enclosures were destroyed. The Alabama Forestry Commission reported $610 million in damage to timber over around 2.7 million acres of land. Despite initial reports of Mobile being in the direct path of the hurricane, Ivan made landfall to the east of the city, causing damage to be less severe than initially expected. However, there were still reports of downed trees, power lines, and damaged billboards across the city. Around inches of rain fell in Birmingham over a one day period, the most the city had recorded in over 100 years. Wind also extender far inland. In the city of Demopolis, which is almost 100 miles inland, received wind gusts of up to . Similarly, Montgomery also saw wind gusts of up to .

Hurricane Ivan caused $18.82 billion in Alabama, which is the costliest ever recorded in the state. 

====Elsewhere in the United States====

Further inland, Ivan caused major flooding, bringing the Chattahoochee River near Atlanta and many other rivers and streams to levels at or near 100-year records. The Delaware River and its tributaries crested just below their all-time records set by Hurricane Diane in 1955. Locations in southern New Hampshire and Massachusetts received over 7 inches of rainfall from the remnants of Ivan, causing flooding and mudslides. In Connecticut, high winds moved in quickly and unexpectedly, and a boater was killed when his trimaran capsized in 50-knot winds on Long Island Sound.

In western North Carolina, many streams and rivers reached well above flood stage in an area that was heavily flood damaged just a week and a half prior from the remnants of Hurricane Frances, causing many roads to be closed. High winds contributed to widespread power outages throughout the mountainous region. The Blue Ridge Parkway as well as Interstate 40 through the Pigeon River gorge in Haywood County, North Carolina, sustained major damage, and landslides were common across the mountains. There was major flooding along the French Broad River and Swannanoa River in Asheville, North Carolina, and along the Pigeon River near Canton, North Carolina. As a result of the rain, a major debris flow of mud, rocks, trees, and water surged down Peek&#x27;s Creek, near Franklin, North Carolina, sweeping away 15 houses and killing five people.

The system also spawned deadly tornadoes as far north as Maryland and destroyed seven oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico while at sea. While crossing over the Mid-Atlantic states, Ivan&#x27;s remnants spawned 117 tornadoes across the eastern United States, with the 40 tornadoes spawned in Virginia on September 17 setting a daily record for the commonwealth. Ivan then moved into the Wheeling, West Virginia and Pittsburgh area, causing major flooding and gusty winds. Pittsburgh International Airport recorded the highest 24-hour rainfall for Pittsburgh, recording of rain. Ivan&#x27;s rain caused widespread flooding. The Juniata River basin was flooded, and the Frankstown Branch crested at its highest level ever. After Ivan regenerated in the Gulf of Mexico, it caused further heavy rainfall up to in areas of Louisiana and Texas.

===Canada===
On the morning of September 21, the remnant mid-level circulation of Ivan combined with a frontal system. This produced a plume of moisture over the Canadian Maritimes for four days, producing heavy rainfall totaling in Gander, Newfoundland. High winds of up to downed trees and caused power outages in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and eastern Nova Scotia. The system produced intense waves of up to near Cape Bonavista. The system killed two when it grounded a fishing vessel and was indirectly responsible for four traffic fatalities in Newfoundland.

==Aftermath==

===Grenada===

Grenada suffered serious economic repercussions following the destruction caused by Ivan. Before Ivan, the economy of Grenada was projected to grow by 4.7%, but the island&#x27;s economy instead contracted by nearly 3% in 2004. The economy was also projected to grow by at least 5% through 2007, but, , that estimate had been lowered to less than 1%. The government of Grenada also admitted that government debt, 130% of the island&#x27;s GDP, was &quot;unsustainable&quot; in October 2004 and appointed a group of professional debt advisors in January 2005 to help seek a cooperative restructuring agreement with creditors.

More than $150 million was sent to Grenada in 2004 to aid reconstruction following Ivan, but the economic situation remains fragile. The International Monetary Fund reports that as &quot;difficult enough as the present fiscal situation is, it is unfortunately quite easy to envisage circumstances that would make it even more so.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;shortfalls in donor financing and tax revenues, or events such as a further rise in global oil prices, pose a grave risk.&quot;

===Jamaica===
By two days after Ivan&#x27;s passage, USAID&#x27;s hurricane recovery program distributed emergency relief supplies for families who were displaced by the storm. During phase one of the recovery program, communities restored three tourist sites, cleared agricultural lands, and completed disaster mitigation. In addition, the U.S. Peace Corps completed thirty small projects in rural communities and low income neighborhoods. 66 health clinics, 25 schools, and 62 water and sanitation systems were repaired during the first phase of recovery. About 1,379 farmers, herders and micro businesses became eligible for grants. By 2005, 55 schools and colleges were repaired, while restoration of 1,560 houses had occurred.

===United States===
On September 27, 2004, President of the United States George W. Bush submitted a budget to the United States Congress which requested over $7 billion (2004 USD) in aid to victims of Hurricane Ivan and Jeanne in the following states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Over half of the $7 billion (2004 USD) was to cover uninsured damage to property and public infrastructure. $889 million was spent to repair Department of Defense facilities. About $600 million was earmarked for emergency repairs to highways and road damaged by Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne. The Small Business Administration (SBA) used $472 million to provide loans for small businesses and homeowners affected by the storm. Approximately $400 million was given by the United States Department of Agriculture to provide financial assistance agricultural producers suffering crop and other losses. Around $132 million was used to repair Federal facilities by several government agencies, including: United States Coast Guard, Federal Bureau of Prisons, the United States Forest Service, and the Federal Aviation Administration. The United States Army Corps of Engineers used $81 million for restoration of coastal areas affected by Ivan. In addition, $50 million of which was for disaster and famine assistance funds Grenada, Jamaica, and Haiti.

Following the storm in Alabama, more than 167,700 people applied for assistance in 65 counties in the state. Over 51 counties in the state became eligible for public assistance. As a result, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Alabama Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) received $735 million, which was spent in disaster assistance, and included: low-interest loans for homeowners and businesses, disaster food stamps, Disaster Unemployment Assistance to those left unemployed as a result of Ivan, &quot;Project Rebound&quot;, and to fill the 5,856 National Flood Insurance Program claims. In addition, there were repairs to public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, utilities, facilities, and parks. 20 Disaster Recovery Centers were opened in 13 counties, which also included the Poarch Creek Indian Reservation. Almost 4,000 linemen were brought into Alabama from outside states to help restore power. Overall, FEMA paid 90% of the $735 million, while the AEMA paid for the other 10%.

Over 400,000 customers in Florida lost power due to the hurricane. This became the third strong hurricane to impact Florida in 2004, the others being Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances. A fourth storm, Jeanne, also impacted Florida just a few days later. After Hurricane Ivan, 4,500 personnel were deployed in Florida, with 3,339 patients being treated, 2.96 million meals distributed, 56 shelters were set up, and $157 million in grants were given. They also completed over 104,000 housing inspections and distributed 97,700 tarps.

Ivan is suspected of bringing spores of soybean rust from Venezuela into the United States, the first ever occurrences of soybean rust found in North America. Since the Florida soybean crop had already been mostly harvested, economic damage was limited. Some of the most severe outbreaks in South America have been known to reduce soybean crop yields by half or more. Following the storm, more than 138,500 residents in 15 counties of the Florida Panhandle applied for federal and state aid. In those counties, a total of $162.6 million was approved by FEMA&#x27;s Individuals and Households Program. In addition, residents of 24 other counties in Florida were eligible for grants and loans. By September 2005, more than $1.4 billion in federal and state assistance was approved for residents and communities in the Florida Panhandle. In addition, the National Flood Insurance Program paid nearly $869 million for more than 9,800 insurance claims after Ivan.

More than $4 million in disaster assistance was approved for Mississippi by FEMA and the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA). In addition, the SBA issued nearly 3,000 applications for low-interest loans to homeowners, renters, landlords, businesses, and non-profit organizations. The loans covered up to $200,000 in real estate repairs/replacements and up to $40,000 in repairs/replacements of personal property.

Residents and business owners in eight parishes of Louisiana became eligible for disaster assistance. By one week before the deadline to apply on November 15, 2004, about 9,527 residents applied for disaster assistance. Overall, FEMA and the Government of Louisiana provided more than $3.8 million to those that requested assistance. In addition, the SBA also allowed applications for loans to repair personal property until that day.

===Retirement===

Because of the severe damage and number of deaths caused by the hurricane in the Caribbean and United States, the name &quot;Ivan&quot; was retired in the spring of 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization and will never again be used in the Atlantic basin. It was replaced with &quot;Igor&quot; for the 2010 season.

===Hydrological records===
Ivan broke multiple hydrological records; it is credited with possibly causing the largest ocean wave ever recorded, a wave that may have been as high as , and the fastest seafloor current, at .
