<text>The origins of rock and roll are complex. Rock and roll emerged as a defined musical style in the United States in the early to mid-1950s. It derived most directly from the rhythm and blues music of the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier blues, the beat-heavy jump blues, boogie woogie, up-tempo jazz, and swing music. It was also influenced by gospel, country and western, and traditional folk music. Rock and roll in turn provided the main basis for the music that, since the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as rock music.

The phrase &quot;rocking and rolling&quot; originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but it was used by the early 20th century, both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still intermittently – in the late 1930s and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; music aimed at black audiences. In 1939 during the April 5th broadcast on “The Fred Allen- Town Hall Tonight- Show” the song “Rock and Roll” appeared as a barber shop quartet lead-in. In May 1942, long before the concept of rock and roll had been defined, a &quot;Billboard&quot; record review described Sister Rosetta Tharpe&#x27;s vocals on the upbeat blues song &quot;Rock Me&quot;, by Lucky Millinder, as &quot;rock-and-roll spiritual singing&quot;.

In 1951, Cleveland-based disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style while popularizing the term &quot;rock and roll&quot; on mainstream radio. As a 2018 BBC article explained, &quot;by the time DJ Alan Freed started using the term to describe ... rhythm and blues ... the sexual component had been dialled down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing&quot;.

Freed was the first radio disc jockey and concert producer who frequently played and promoted rock and roll, including songs by black artists that were considered to be R&amp;B. Various recordings that date back to the 1940s have been named as the first rock and roll record, or at least as precursors of the music.

==The term &quot;rock and roll&quot;==
===Early usage of the phrase===
The alliterative phrase &quot;rocking and rolling&quot; originally was used by s at least as early as the 17th century to describe the combined &quot;rocking&quot; ( and ) and &quot;rolling&quot; (side to side) motion of a ship on the ocean. Examples include an 1821 reference, &quot;... prevent her from rocking and rolling ...&quot;, and an 1835 reference to a ship &quot;... rocking and rolling on both beam-ends&quot;.

The hymn &quot;Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep&quot;, with words written in the 1830s by Emma Willard and tune by Joseph Philip Knight, was recorded several times around the start of the 20th century by the Original Bison City Quartet before 1894, the Standard Quartette in 1895, John W. Myers at about the same time, and Gus Reed in 1908. By that time, the specific phrase &quot;rocking and rolling&quot; was also used by African Americans in spirituals with a religious connotation.

On April 25, 1881, comedian John W. Morton of Morton&#x27;s Minstrels performed a song entitled &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; as part of a repertoire of comic songs at a concert at the Theatre Royal in Victoria, British Columbia. A comic song titled &quot;Rock and Roll Me&quot; was performed by Johnny Gardner of the Moore&#x27;s Troubadours theatrical group during a performance in Australia in 1886, and one newspaper critic wrote that Gardner &quot;made himself so amusing that the large audience fairly rocked and rolled with laughter.&quot;

The earliest known recordings of the phrase were in several versions of &quot;The Camp Meeting Jubilee&quot;, by both the Edison Male Quartet and the Columbia Quartette, recorded between 1896 and 1900. It contained the lyrics &quot;Keep on rockin&#x27; an&#x27; rolling in your arms/ Rockin&#x27; an&#x27; rolling in your arms/ Rockin&#x27; an&#x27; rolling in your arms/ In the arms of Moses.&quot; &quot;Rocking&quot; was also used to describe the spiritual rapture felt by worshippers at certain religious events, and to refer to the rhythm often found in the accompanying music.

At around the same time, the terminology was used in secular contexts, for example to describe the motion of railroad trains. It has been suggested that it also was used by men building railroads, who would sing to keep the pace, swinging their hammers down to drill a hole into the rock, and the men who held the steel spikes would &quot;rock&quot; the spike back and forth to clear rock or &quot;roll&quot;, twisting it to improve the &quot;bite&quot; of the drill. &quot;Rocking&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; were also used, both separately and together, in a sexual context; writers for hundreds of years had used the phrases &quot;They had a roll in the hay&quot; or &quot;I rolled her in the clover&quot;.

===20th century uses===
By the early 20th century the words increasingly were used together in secular black slang with a double meaning, ostensibly referring to dancing and partying, but often with the subtextual meaning of sex.

In 1922, blues singer Trixie Smith recorded &quot;My Man Rocks Me (with One Steady Roll),&quot; first featuring the two words in a secular context. Although it was played with a backbeat and was one of the first &quot;around the clock&quot; lyrics, this slow minor-key blues was by no means &quot;rock and roll&quot; in the later sense.

However, the terms &quot;rocking&quot;, and &quot;rocking and rolling&quot;, were increasingly used through the 1920s and into the late 1940s, especially but not exclusively by black secular blues and jump blues musicians, to refer to either dancing or sex, or both. The term maintained a strong sexual connotation in the blues and R&amp;B genre into the 1950s.

In 1927, blues singer Blind Blake used the couplet &quot;Now we gonna do the old country rock / First thing we do, swing your partners&quot; in &quot;West Coast Blues&quot;, which in turn formed the basis of &quot;Old Country Rock&quot; by William Moore the following year. Also in 1927, traditional country musician Uncle Dave Macon, with his group the Fruit Jar Drinkers, recorded &quot;Sail Away Ladies&quot; with a refrain of &quot;Don&#x27;t she rock, daddy-o&quot;, and &quot;Rock About My Saro Jane&quot;. Duke Ellington recorded &quot;Rockin&#x27; in Rhythm&quot; in 1928, and Robinson&#x27;s Knights of Rest recorded &quot;Rocking and Rolling&quot; in 1930.

In 1932, the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; was heard in the Hal Roach film &quot;Asleep in the Feet&quot;. In 1934, the Boswell Sisters had a pop hit with &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; from the film &quot;Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round&quot;, where the term was used to describe the motion of a ship at sea. In 1935, Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen recorded &quot;Get Rhythm in Your Feet and Music in Your Soul&quot; which included the lyric &quot;If Satan starts to hound you, commence to rock and roll / Get rhythm in your feet...&quot; The lyrics were written by the prolific composer J. Russel Robinson with Bill Livingston. Allen&#x27;s recording was a &quot;race&quot; record on the Vocalion label, but the tune was quickly covered by white musicians, notably Benny Goodman with singer Helen Ward.

Other notable recordings using the words, both released in 1938, were &quot;Rock It for Me&quot; by Chick Webb, a swing number with Ella Fitzgerald on vocals featuring the lyrics &quot;... Won&#x27;t you satisfy my soul, With the rock and roll?&quot;; and &quot;Rock Me&quot; by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a gospel song originally written by Thomas Dorsey as &quot;Hide Me in Thy Bosom&quot;. Tharpe performed the song in the style of a city blues, with secular lyrics, ecstatic vocals and electric guitar. She changed Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;singing&quot; to &quot;swinging,&quot; and the way she rolled the &quot;R&quot; in &quot;rock me&quot; led to the phrase being taken as a double entendre, with the interpretation as religious or sexual.

The following year, Western swing musician Buddy Jones recorded &quot;Rockin&#x27; Rollin&#x27; Mama&quot;, which drew on the term&#x27;s original meaning – &quot;Waves on the ocean, waves in the sea/ But that gal of mine rolls just right for me/ Rockin&#x27; rollin&#x27; mama, I love the way you rock and roll&quot;. In August 1939, Irene Castle devised a new dance called &quot;The Castle Rock and Roll&quot;, described as &quot;an easy swing step&quot;, which she performed at the Dancing Masters of America convention at the Hotel Astor. The Marx Brothers&#x27; 1941 film &quot;The Big Store&quot; featured actress Virginia O&#x27;Brien singing a song starting out as a traditional lullaby which soon changes into a rocking boogie-woogie with lines like &quot;Rock, rock, rock it, baby ...&quot;. Although the song was only a short comedy number, it contains references which, by then, would have been understood by a wide general audience.

When Alan Freed began referring to rock and roll on mainstream radio in 1951 however, &quot;the sexual component had been dialled down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing&quot;.

===&quot;Rock and roll&quot; as a music style===
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, an early use of the word &quot;rock&quot; in describing a style of music was in a review in &quot;Metronome&quot; magazine on July 21, 1938, which stated that &quot;Harry James&#x27; &quot;Lullaby in Rhythm&quot; really rocks.&quot; In 1939, a review of &quot;Ciribiribin&quot; and &quot;Yodelin&#x27; Jive&quot; by the Andrews Sisters with Bing Crosby, in the journal &quot;The Musician&quot;, stated that the songs &quot;... rock and roll with unleashed enthusiasm tempered to strict four-four time&quot;.

By the early 1940s, the term &quot;rock and roll&quot; was being used in record reviews by &quot;Billboard&quot; journalist and columnist Maurie Orodenker. In the May 30, 1942 issue, for instance, he described Sister Rosetta Tharpe&#x27;s vocals on a re-recording of &quot;Rock Me&quot; with Lucky Millinder&#x27;s band as &quot;rock-and-roll spiritual singing&quot;, and on October 3, 1942, he described Count Basie&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Sand, Man!&quot; as &quot;an instrumental screamer.. [which].. displays its rock and roll capacities when tackling the righteous rhythms.&quot; In the April 25, 1945 edition, Orodenker described Erskine Hawkins&#x27; version of &quot;Caldonia&quot; as &quot;right rhythmic rock and roll music&quot;, a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of &quot;Sugar Lump&quot; by Joe Liggins.

A double meaning came to popular awareness in 1947 in blues artist Roy Brown&#x27;s song &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, one of the contenders for the first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record. It was covered in 1948 by Wynonie Harris in a wilder version, in which &quot;rocking&quot; was ostensibly about dancing but was in fact a thinly veiled allusion to sex. Such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves. After the success of &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, many other R&amp;B artists used similar titles through the late 1940s. At least two different songs with the title &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; were recorded in the late 1940s: by Paul Bascomb in 1947 and Wild Bill Moore in 1948. In May 1948, Savoy Records advertised &quot;Robbie-Dobey Boogie&quot; by Brownie McGhee with the tagline &quot;It jumps, it&#x27;s made, it rocks, it rolls.&quot; Another record where the phrase was repeated throughout the song was &quot;Rock and Roll Blues&quot;, recorded in 1949 by Erline &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; Harris. These songs were generally classed as &quot;race music&quot; or, from the late 1940s, &quot;rhythm and blues&quot;, and were barely known by mainstream white audiences.

However, in 1951, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began broadcasting rhythm, blues, and country music for a multi-racial audience. As one source points out, there was some controversy in his selection of recordings: &quot;Freed would play the original singles by the black artists instead of waiting for a white singer to cover them&quot;.

Freed, familiar with the music of earlier decades, used the phrase &#x27;rock and roll&#x27; to describe the music he aired over station WJW (850 AM); its use is also credited to Freed&#x27;s sponsor, record store owner Leo Mintz, who encouraged Freed to play the music on the radio.

Several sources suggest that Freed discovered the term (a euphemism for sexual intercourse) on the record &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; by Billy Ward and his Dominoes. The lyrics include the line, &quot;I rock &#x27;em, roll &#x27;em all night long&quot;. Freed did not acknowledge the suggestion about that source (or the original meaning of the expression) in interviews, and explained the term as follows: &quot;Rock ’n roll is really swing with a modern name. It began on the levees and plantations, took in folk songs, and features blues and rhythm&quot;.

In discussing Alan Freed&#x27;s contribution to the genre, two significant sources emphasized the importance of R&amp;B in its development. After Freed was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, the organization&#x27;s website offered this comment: &quot;He became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music on the radio in the United States and Europe under the name of rock and roll&quot;. Some years later, Greg Harris, then the Executive Director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said to CNN: &quot;Freed&#x27;s role in breaking down racial barriers in U.S. pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, put the radio personality &#x27;at the vanguard&#x27; and made him &#x27;a really important figure&#x27;&quot;.

==Development of the musical style==

Rock and roll music emerged from the wide variety of musical genres that existed in the United States in the first half of the 20th century among different ethnic and social groups. Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. Contributions came from America&#x27;s black population, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of &quot;blue notes&quot; and often using a &quot;call and response&quot; vocal pattern. African music was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk ballad, and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of blues, ragtime, jazz, and gospel music. According to the writer Robert Palmer:&quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle. Bedrock black church music influenced blues, rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the Northern ghettos, blues and black pop influenced jazz, and so on. But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white.&quot;

By the 1930s, African American musicians, such as Cab Calloway, Fletcher Henderson and Duke Ellington, were developing swing music, essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as Count Basie&#x27;s, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as the Harlem Hamfats, and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as Jimmie Rodgers incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, Western swing bands, such as Bob Wills, Moon Mullican and Cliff Bruner combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other&#x27;s music, so styles merged and innovations spread. Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, 78 rpm and later records and jukeboxes, and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new amplification and electronic recording techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the electric guitar, first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by Charlie Christian.
In 1938, promoter and record producer John H. Hammond staged the first &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist Pete Johnson and singer Big Joe Turner, whose recording of &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; helped spark a craze across American society for &quot;boogie woogie&quot; music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier big bands unwieldy; Louis Jordan left Chick Webb&#x27;s orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring &quot;honking&quot; saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This &quot;jump blues&quot; encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by Lionel Hampton.

Increasingly, the term &quot;rocking&quot; was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as Wynonie Harris whose records reached the top of the newly christened &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; charts.

In 1947, blues singer Roy Brown recorded &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word &quot;rocking&quot; and the gospel call &quot;Have you heard the news?&quot;, relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about &quot;rocking&quot;, including &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Rock&quot; by Wild Bill Moore, the first commercially successful &quot;honking&quot; sax record, with the words &quot;We&#x27;re gonna rock, we&#x27;re gonna roll&quot; as a background chant. One of the most popular was &quot;Rock the Joint&quot;, first recorded by Jimmy Preston in May 1949, and a R&amp;B top 10 hit that year. Preston&#x27;s version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen. Marshall Lytle, Haley&#x27;s bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired Alan Freed to coin the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to refer to the music he played.

Freed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community&#x27;s need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as &quot;rocking&quot; rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential &quot;Rocket 88&quot; recorded by Ike Turner and his band but credited to singer Jackie Brenston, the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as &quot;doo-wop&quot;, such as &quot;Gee&quot; by the Crows and &quot;Earth Angel&quot; by the Penguins, became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included Modern, Imperial, Specialty, Atlantic, King and Chess.

According to some, including singer Tony Bennett, the father of the genre was Johnnie Ray, whose first record, &quot;Cry&quot;, reached number 1 on the Billboard chart in 1951. One source states that Ray &quot;opened the way for Elvis and the overt sexual energy of rock and roll ... [and] is credited by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elton John as being a formative influence on their artistic styles&quot;. As well, Ray&#x27;s manager said that Elvis Presley often watched Johnnie&#x27;s concerts.

The adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As Billy Burnette said about his father Dorsey Burnette and uncle Johnny Burnette:

They&#x27;d buy their clothes on Beale Street, at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin&#x27; it, they were just about the first.

Some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years – such as Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, and Fats Domino who had his first R&amp;B hit in 1950 – made the transition into new markets.

Fats Domino was not convinced that his work belonged to a new genre. In 1957, he said: &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I’ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;. In an interview, Ike Turner offered a similar comment but about Rocket 88: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that ‘Rocket 88’ is rock ‘n’ roll. I think that ‘Rocket 88’ is R&amp;B, but I think ‘Rocket 88’ is the cause of rock and roll existing&quot;.

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties&quot;.

Much of the initial breakthrough of rock and roll into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as double tracking, developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in jukeboxes. At the same time, younger black musicians such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era.

By the time of Haley&#x27;s first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, the term and the concept of rock and roll was firmly established.

The Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.

Another white singer, Johnnie Ray, who began to achieve success in the early 1950s, has also been called a major precursor to what became rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, for his jazz and blues-influenced music, and his animated stage personality. Tony Bennett called Ray the &quot;father of rock and roll.&quot; Some historians have noted him as a pioneering figure in the development of the genre. One source states that Ray &quot;opened the way for Elvis and the overt sexual energy of rock and roll ... [and] is credited by the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elton John as being a formative influence on their artistic styles&quot;. As well, Ray&#x27;s manager said that Elvis often watched Johnnie&#x27;s concerts.

==Key recordings==
===1920s===
* &quot;My Man Rocks Me (with One Steady Roll)&quot; by Trixie Smith was issued in 1922, the first record to refer to &quot;rocking&quot; and &quot;rolling&quot; in a secular context.
* Papa Charlie Jackson recorded &quot;Shake That Thing&quot; in 1925.
* &quot;That Black Snake Moan&quot;, a country blues first recorded in 1926 by Blind Lemon Jefferson, contains the lines &quot;That&#x27;s all right mama / That&#x27;s all right for you / Mama, that&#x27;s all right / Most any old way you do&quot;, later famously used by Arthur Crudup for his song &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, subsequently covered by Elvis Presley as his first single.
* &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues&quot;, by Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis foreshadowed &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; a year later, perhaps not coincidentally since Lewis and Pine Top had recently been roommates. Like Pine Top&#x27;s later recording, it contained most of the elements that would be called Rock and Roll thirty years later, except with piano instead of guitar. 
* &quot;Way Down in Egypt Land” by the Biddleville Quintette, a gospel group from Biddleville, Charlotte, North Carolina who recorded for Paramount Records in 1926, has been described as &quot;the earliest recording... featuring a consistent backbeat.&quot;
* &quot;Sail Away Ladies&quot; and &quot;Rock About My Saro Jane&quot; were recorded by Uncle Dave Macon and his Fruit Jar Drinkers on May 7, 1927. &quot;Sail Away Ladies&quot; is a traditional square dance tune, with, in Macon&#x27;s version, a vocal refrain of &quot;Don&#x27;t she rock, daddy-o&quot;, which in other versions became &quot;Don&#x27;t you rock me, daddy-o&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t You Rock Me, Daddy-o&quot; later became a hit in the UK in 1957 for both the Vipers Skiffle Group and Lonnie Donegan. Macon is thought to have learned the song &quot;Rock About My Saro Jane&quot; from black stevedores at Nashville in the 1880s, although Alan Lomax believed that the song dated from the mid-19th century.
* &quot;Jim Jackson&#x27;s Kansas City Blues&quot; by Jim Jackson, recorded on October 10, 1927, was a best selling blues, suggested as one of the first million-seller records. Its melody line was later re-used and developed by Charlie Patton in &quot;Going to Move to Alabama&quot; (1929) and Hank Williams (&quot;Move It on Over&quot;) (1947) before emerging in &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, (1954) and its lyrical content presaged Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Kansas City&quot;. It contains the line &quot;It takes a rocking chair to rock, a rubber ball to roll,&quot; which had previously been used in 1924 by Ma Rainey in &quot;Jealous Hearted Blues&quot;, and which Bill Haley would later incorporate into his 1952 recording &quot;Sundown Boogie.&quot;
* &quot;It&#x27;s Tight Like That&quot; by Tampa Red with pianist Georgia Tom (Thomas A. Dorsey), recorded on October 24, 1928, was a highly successful early hokum record, which combined bawdy rural humor with sophisticated musical technique. With his Chicago Five, Tampa Red later went on to pioneer the Chicago small group &quot;Bluebird&quot; sound, and Dorsey became &quot;the father of black gospel music&quot;.
* &quot;Pine Top&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; by Clarence &quot;Pinetop&quot; Smith, recorded on December 29, 1928, was one of the first hit &quot;boogie woogie&quot; recordings, and the first to include classic rock and roll references to &quot;the girl with the red dress on&quot; being told to &quot;not move a peg&quot; until she could &quot;shake that thing&quot; and &quot;mess around&quot;. Smith&#x27;s tune derives from Jimmy Blythe&#x27;s 1925 recording &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Blues&quot;, and earlier records had been made in a similar style by Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis and others. A hit &quot;pop&quot; version of Smith&#x27;s record was released by Tommy Dorsey in 1938 as &quot;Boogie Woogie&quot;.
* &quot;Crazy About My Baby&quot; by Blind Roosevelt Graves and brother, Uaroy, recorded in 1929, was a rhythmic country blues with small group accompaniment. Researcher Gayle Dean Wardlow has stated that this &quot;could be considered the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll recording&quot;. The brothers also recorded rhythmic gospel music. The Graves brothers, with an additional piano player, later were recorded as the Mississippi Jook Band, whose 1936 recordings including &quot;Skippy Whippy&quot;, &quot;Barbecue Bust&quot; and &quot;Hittin&#x27;the Bottle Stomp&quot; were highly rhythmic instrumental recordings which, according to writer Robert Palmer, &quot;..featured fully formed rock and roll guitar riffs and a stomping rock and roll beat&quot;.

===1930s===

* &quot;Standing on the Corner (Blue Yodel No. 9)&quot; by Jimmie Rodgers, recorded on July 16, 1930, was one of a series of recordings made by the biggest early star of country music in the late 1920s and early 1930s, based on blues songs he had heard on his travels. &quot;Blue Yodel No. 9&quot; was recorded with an uncredited Louis Armstrong (cornet) and Lil Armstrong (piano), foreshadowing later collaborations between black and white musicians but which at the time were almost unprecedented.
* &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; by the Washboard Rhythm Kings (later known as the Georgia Washboard Stompers), recorded in 1932, was a virtually out-of-control performance, with a rocking washboard and unusually high energy. It opens with a repeated one-note guitar lick that would transform into a chord in the hands of Robert Johnson, T-Bone Walker and others. This is just one of many recordings by spasm bands, jug bands, and skiffle groups that have the same wild, informal feel that early rock and roll had. After the original recording by the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1917, &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; had become a jazz standard as well as widely covered in dance band and march orchestrations.
* &quot;Good Lord (Run Old Jeremiah)&quot; by Austin Coleman with Joe Washington Brown, from 1934, was a frenzied and raucous ring shout recorded by John and Alan Lomax in a church in Jennings, Louisiana, with the singer declaiming &quot;I&#x27;m going to rock, you gonna rock ... I sit there and rock, I sit there and rock, yeah yeah yeah.&quot; Music historian Robert Palmer wrote that &quot;the rhythmic singing, the hard-driving beat, the bluesy melody, and the improvised, stream-of-consciousness words... all anticipate key aspects of rock &#x27;n roll as it would emerge some 20 years later.&quot;
* &quot;Oh! Red&quot; by the Harlem Hamfats, recorded on April 18, 1936, was a hit record made by a small group of jazz and blues musicians assembled by J. Mayo Williams for the specific purpose of making commercially successful dance records. Viewed at the time (and subsequently by jazz fans) as a novelty group, the format became very influential, and the group&#x27;s recordings included many with sex and drugs references.
* &quot;I Believe I&#x27;ll Dust My Broom&quot; (recorded on November 23, 1936), &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot; (recorded on November 27, 1936), and other recordings by Robert Johnson, while not particularly successful at the time, directly influenced the development of Chicago blues and, when reissued in the 1960s, also strongly influenced later rock musicians.
* &quot;Rock It for Me&quot; was recorded by Ella Fitzgerald with Chick Webb and His Orchestra in 1937. Its lyrics mentioned a kind of music called &quot;rock and roll&quot;: &quot;Every night/You&#x27;ll see all the nifties/Plenty tight/Swingin&#x27; down the fifties/Now they&#x27;re all through with symphony/Ho ho ho, rock it for me!/Now it&#x27;s true that once upon a time/The opera was the thing/But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme/So won&#x27;t you satisfy my soul/With the rock and roll?&quot;
* &quot;One O&#x27;Clock Jump&quot; by Count Basie, arranged by Eddie Durham and recorded on July 7, 1937, was based on a 12-bar blues that builds in rhythmic intensity and features, like many of Basie&#x27;s other records, the rhythm section of Jo Jones (drums), Walter Page (bass), and Freddie Green (rhythm guitar) that &quot;all but invented the notion of swing through their innovations&quot;. 
* &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot; by Benny Goodman, also from 1937, written by Louis Prima, featured repeated drum breaks by Gene Krupa, whose musical nature and high showmanship presaged rock and roll drumming.
* &quot;Rock Me&quot; by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, recorded on October 31, 1938, was important not only for its lyrical content, but for its style. Many later rock and roll stars, including Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Little Richard, cited Tharpe&#x27;s singing, electric guitar playing, and energetic performance style as an influence. Tharpe performed the song with pianist Albert Ammons at the &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert presented by John Hammond in Carnegie Hall on December 23, 1938. She also re-recorded the song with Lucky Millinder&#x27;s band in 1942, and columnist Maurie Orodenker described her vocals as &quot;rock-and-roll spiritual singing&quot;.
* &quot;Ida Red&quot; by Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, recorded in 1938 by a Western swing band, featuring electric guitar by Eldon Shamblin. The tune was recycled again some years later by Chuck Berry in &quot;Maybellene&quot;.
* &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; by Pete Johnson and Joe Turner, recorded on December 30, 1938, was an up-tempo, non-swung boogie woogie with a hand-clapping backbeat and a collation of blues verses
* &quot;Rocking the Blues&quot; by the Port of Harlem Jazz Men, a group comprising Frank Newton, J.C. Higginbotham, Albert Ammons, Teddy Bunn, John Williams and Sidney Catlett, was an upbeat instrumental issued in 1939 as Blue Note no. 3.

===1940s===
* &quot;Early in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Jivin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, both recorded on May 17, 1940, by &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson, the first of the two musicians who used that name, are examples of the very influential and popular rhythmic small group Chicago blues recordings on Lester Melrose&#x27;s Bluebird label, and among the first on which drums (by Fred Williams) were prominently recorded.
* &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot; by the Will Bradley Orchestra, a smooth rocking boogie number, was recorded in August 1940 with drummer &quot;Eight Beat Mack&quot; Ray McKinley sharing the vocals with the song&#x27;s writer Don Raye. The song would later become a rock and roll standard. The &quot;eight beats&quot; in McKinley&#x27;s nickname and the popular phrase &quot;eight to the bar&quot; in many songs indicate the newness of the shift from the four beats per bar of jazz to boogie woogie&#x27;s eight beats per bar, which became, and remains, characteristic of rock and roll. Bradley also recorded the first version of Raye&#x27;s &quot;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot;, later recorded with greater commercial success by the Andrews Sisters, whose biggest hit &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot; also contains numerous proto-rock and roll elements.
* &quot;Flying Home&quot; was recorded most famously in 1942 by Lionel Hampton and His Orchestra, with tenor sax solo by Illinois Jacquet, recreated and refined live by Arnett Cobb. This became a model for rock and roll solos ever since: emotional, honking, long, not just an instrumental break but the keystone of the song. The Benny Goodman Sextet had a popular hit in 1939 with a more subdued version of the song, featuring electric guitarist Charlie Christian. The book &quot;What Was the First Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Record?&quot; by Jim Dawson and Steve Propes discusses 50 contenders as the &quot;first rock and roll record&quot;, the earliest being &quot;Blues, Part 2&quot; from the 1944 &quot;Jazz at the Philharmonic&quot; live album, also featuring Jacquet&#x27;s saxophone but with an even more &quot;honking&quot; solo.
* &quot;Mean Old World&quot; by T-Bone Walker, recorded in 1942, is an early classic by this hugely influential guitarist, often cited as the first song in which he fully found his sound. B.B. King credits Walker as inspiring him to take up the electric guitar, but his influence extended far beyond the blues to jazz and rock and roll. Among other innovations, &quot;Mean Old World&quot; has a two-string guitar lick where Walker bends notes on the G string up to the notes on the B string, which would be used by Chuck Berry in &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; and other songs.
* &quot;Caldonia&quot; was first recorded by Louis Jordan and then by Erskine Hawkins and others; the Hawkins version was called &quot;right rhythmic rock-and-roll music&quot; by Billboard. (The actual concept of rock and roll had not actually been defined at that time.) Several sources indicate that Little Richard was influenced by Louis Jordan. In fact, the artist said &quot;Caldonia&quot; was the first non-gospel song he learned; and the shriek on the Jordan record &quot;sounds eerily like the vocal tone Little Richard would adopt&quot; in addition to the &quot;Jordan-style pencil-thin moustache&quot;. 
* &quot;Rock Me Mamma&quot; by Arthur &quot;Big Boy&quot; Crudup, recorded on December 15, 1944, was the blues singer&#x27;s first and biggest R&amp;B chart hit, but in later decades became overshadowed by his – at the time, much less successful – 1946 recording of &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;.
* &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot; by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, recorded in 1944 with pianist Sammy Price, was a boogie-woogie flavored gospel song that &quot;crossed over&quot; to become a hit on the &quot;race records&quot; chart, the first gospel recording to do so. It featured Tharpe on an electric guitar and is considered an important precursor to rock and roll.
* &quot;The Honeydripper&quot; by Joe Liggins, recorded on April 20, 1945, synthesized boogie-woogie piano, jazz, and the riff from the folk chestnut &quot;Shortnin&#x27; Bread&quot;, into an exciting dance performance that topped the R&amp;B &quot;race&quot; charts for 18 weeks (a record later shared with Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot;) and also made the pop charts. The lyrics proclaimed urban arrogance and were sexually suggestive – &quot;He&#x27;s a solid gold cat, the honeydripper... he&#x27;s a killer, a Harlem diller...&quot;.
* &quot;Guitar Boogie&quot; by Arthur Smith, originally recorded in 1945 but not a hit until reissued in 1948, was the first boogie woogie played on the electric guitar, and was much imitated by later rock and roll guitarists. The tune was based on &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; from 1929.
* &quot;The House of Blue Lights&quot; by Freddie Slack and Ella Mae Morse was recorded on February 12, 1946. The song was co-written by Slack with Don Raye, and, like Raye&#x27;s &quot;Down the Road a Piece&quot;, was recorded later by many rock and roll singers. Morse was one of the first white singers to perform what would now be regarded as rhythm and blues music. &quot;The House of Blue Lights&quot; was an important precursor to rock and roll.
* &quot;Route 66&quot;, was recorded by the Nat Cole Trio on March 15, 1946. Written by Bobby Troup, the song was a big hit for Cole – who by that time already had 11 top ten hits on the R&amp;B chart, starting with &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Right&quot; in 1942 – and was later widely covered by rock and roll performers, including Chuck Berry. 
* &quot;Boogie Woogie Baby,&quot; &quot;Freight Train Boogie&quot; and &quot;Hillbilly Boogie&quot; by the Delmore Brothers, featuring harmonica player Wayne Raney, were typically up-tempo recordings, heavily influenced by the blues, by this highly influential country music duo, who had first recorded in 1931.
* &quot;Open the Door, Richard&quot; was a novelty R&amp;B record based on a comedy routine performed by Dusty Fletcher, Pigmeat Markham and others. It was first recorded in September 1946 by Jack McVea, and immediately covered by many other artists, including Fletcher, Count Basie, The Three Flames, and Louis Jordan, all of whom had hits with it. It was the precursor of many similar novelty R&amp;B-based records, which became a mainstay of early rock and roll in recordings by groups such as the Coasters.
* &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; by Arthur Crudup, released as a B side in 1946 and featuring Ransom Knowling on string bass and Judge Riley on drums, may be considered a transition song between blues and rock and roll and, arguably, the first rock and roll song according to several sources, including Southeastern Louisiana University rock historian Joseph Burns, who adds that &quot;this song could contain the first ever guitar solo break&quot;. One reliable source states that it &quot;stands as a convincing front-runner for rock ‘n’ roll&#x27;s ground zero&quot;. The song was covered by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his first single but Presley&#x27;s version was &quot;at least twice as fast as the original&quot;. 
* &quot;Move It on Over&quot; by Hank Williams was recorded on April 21, 1947. It was Williams&#x27; first hit on the country music charts, reaching no. 4. It used a similar melody to Jim Jackson&#x27;s 1927 &quot;Kansas City Blues&quot; and was adapted several years later for &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;.

* &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, in separate versions by Roy Brown (1947) on the DeLuxe label and Wynonie Harris (1948), led to a craze for blues with &quot;rocking&quot; in the title. Roy Brown&#x27;s original version was described on the record label as a &quot;Rocking blues&quot;. One source states that the &quot;opening line ... could double as a rallying call for rock ‘n’ roll&quot;.
* &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; by Wild Bill Moore was recorded in 1948 and released in 1949. This was a rocking boogie where Moore repeats throughout the song &quot;We&#x27;re going to rock and roll, we&#x27;re going to roll and rock&quot; and ends the song with the line &quot;Look out mamma, going to do the rock and roll.&quot; Another version of this song (with songwriting credit to Moore) was recorded in 1949 by Doles Dickens. Also related were &quot;Rock and Roll Blues&quot; by Erline &#x27;Rock and Roll&#x27; Harris, a female singer, with the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;ll turn out the lights, we&#x27;ll rock and roll all night&quot; and &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; by Albennie Jones, co-written and produced by Milt Gabler, with the lyrics &quot;We&#x27;re gonna rock and roll at the hole in the wall tonight&quot;. However, the former vice-chairman of Modern Records, does not consider Moore&#x27;s &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; to be the first in the genre.
* &quot;It&#x27;s Too Soon to Know&quot;, written by Deborah Chessler and performed by The Orioles, was number one on the American rhythm and blues charts in November 1948 and is considered by some to be the first &quot;rock and roll&quot; song.
* &quot;Boogie Chillen&#x27;&quot; (or &quot;Boogie Chillun&quot;) is a blues song written by John Lee Hooker and recorded in 1948. It was Hooker&#x27;s debut record release and became a No. 1 Billboard R&amp;B chart hit in 1949. The guitar figure from &quot;Boogie Chillen&#x27;&quot; has been called &quot;the riff that launched a million songs&quot;, inspiring many popular blues and rock songs. It is considered one of the blues recordings most influential on the forthcoming rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.
* &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; by Goree Carter was recorded in April 1949. It has been cited as a contender for the &quot;first rock and roll record&quot; title and a &quot;much more appropriate candidate&quot; than the more frequently cited &quot;Rocket 88&quot; (1951) according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Carter&#x27;s over-driven electric guitar style was similar to that of Chuck Berry from 1955 onward. Critic Rober Palmer also cited &quot; its lyrical instruction to “rock awhile,” and the way the guitar crackled through an overdriven amp&quot;. 
* &quot;Rock the Joint&quot;, recorded by Jimmy Preston in May 1949, was a prototype rock and roll song which was successful in its own right and highly influential in that it was recorded three years later in 1952 by Bill Haley in the same hard rocking style. Although Haley first recorded in 1946, his early recordings, including &quot;Rovin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, were essentially in the Western swing style of country music as was his 1951 cover of &quot;Rocket 88&quot; (see below). &quot;Rock the Joint&quot; became the first of his records in the style that became known as rockabilly.
* &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; by Louis Jordan and his Tympany Five, recorded in August 1949, was at the top of the R&amp;B chart for 11 weeks and crossed-over to reach number 21 on the national pop chart. The song had a &quot;lively jump rhythm, call-and response chorus and double-string electric guitar riffs that Chuck Berry would later admit to copying&quot;. Jordan is described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as &quot;The Father of Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; and &quot;The Grandfather of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. The Hall also states that &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot; is &quot;an early example of rap and possibly the first rock and roll recording&quot;. Chuck Berry was quoted as saying, &quot;To my recollection, Louis Jordan was the first [person] that I heard play rock and roll.&quot;
* &quot;The Fat Man&quot; by Fats Domino was a &quot;rollicking&quot; song, according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;but what made it a rocker was Fats&#x27;s barrelling piano triplets, combined with a solid big beat&quot;. Recorded in New Orleans on December 10, 1949, the song featured Domino on wah-wah mouth trumpet as well as piano and vocals. The insistent backbeat of the rhythm section dominates. &quot;The Fat Man&quot; &quot;is cited by historians as the first rock and roll single and the first to sell more than 1 million copies&quot;. The tune is that of &quot;Junker Blues&quot;, recorded by Champion Jack Dupree in 1940, which was itself derived from an unrecorded original by Willie &quot;Drive &#x27;Em Down&quot; Hall.

===Early 1950s===
* &quot;Boogie in the Park&quot; by Joe Hill Louis, recorded in July 1950 and released in August 1950, featured Louis as a one-man band performing &quot;one of the loudest, most overdriven, and distorted guitar stomps ever recorded&quot; while playing on a rudimentary drum kit at the same time. It was the only record released on Sam Phillips&#x27; early Phillips label before founding Sun Records. Louis&#x27; electric guitar work is also considered a distant ancestor of heavy metal music.
* &quot;Hot Rod Race&quot; recorded by Arkie Shibley and His Mountain Dew Boys in late 1950, another early example of &quot;rockabilly&quot;, highlighted the role of fast cars in teen culture.
* &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; by Billy Ward and the Dominoes, recorded on December 30, 1950, was the first (and most sexually explicit) big R&amp;B hit to cross over to the pop charts, and features guitar playing by René Hall. The group featured the gospel-style lead vocals of Clyde McPhatter (though not on this song), and appeared at many of Alan Freed&#x27;s early shows. McPhatter later became lead singer of the Drifters, and then a solo star.
* &quot;Rocket 88&quot; was recorded on March 5, 1951, by Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats – actually Ike Turner&#x27;s Kings of Rhythm, with Brenston doing the vocals. It was covered later in the year by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen. The original version – produced in Memphis by Sam Phillips and leased to Chess Records – was highly influential for its sound and lyrical content, and was a big hit. Many writers declare it as the first, or among the first, of the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll genre. Turner considered it to be an R&amp;B song. It reached no. 1 on the Billboard Rhythm and Blues chart on June 9, 1951, and set Phillips on the road to success by helping to finance his company Sun Records. Haley&#x27;s version was one of the first white covers of an R&amp;B hit. The song also features an early example of distortion, or fuzz guitar, played by the band&#x27;s guitarist Willie Kizart. Ike Turner offered this comment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that ‘Rocket 88’ is rock ‘n’ roll. I think that ‘Rocket 88’ is R&amp;B, but I think ‘Rocket 88’ is the cause of rock and roll existing&quot;.
* &quot;How Many More Years&quot; recorded by Howlin&#x27; Wolf in May 1951. Robert Palmer has cited it as the first record to feature a distorted power chord, played by Willie Johnson on the electric guitar.
* &quot;Cry&quot; by Johnnie Ray was recorded on October 16, 1951. Ray&#x27;s emotional delivery – he was mistaken for a woman, as well as for a black man – set a template for later vocal styles, and more importantly, showed that music could cross racial barriers both ways by topping the R&amp;B chart as well as the pop chart.
* &quot;Rock and Roll Blues&quot; by Anita O&#x27;Day recorded on January 22, 1952. One of Anita O&#x27;Day&#x27;s few compositions, she was one of the best jazz singers ever, and recorded this blues single on Mercury Records with her own orchestra.
* &quot;Hound Dog&quot; by Willie Mae &quot;Big Mama&quot; Thornton was recorded on August 13, 1952. A raucous R&amp;B song recorded with Johnny Otis&#x27; band (uncredited for contractual reasons), it was written by white teenagers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, covered three years later by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys (Teen Records 101), and then more famously by Elvis Presley. According to Maureen Mahon, a music professor at New York University, Thornton&#x27;s version is &quot;an important beginning of rock-and-roll, especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument&quot;.
* &quot;Love My Baby&quot; and &quot;Mystery Train&quot; were recorded by Junior Parker with his electric blues band, the Blue Flames in 1953, &quot;contributing a pair of future rockabilly standards&quot; that later would be covered by Hayden Thompson and Elvis Presley, respectively. For Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;Mystery Train&quot;, Scotty Moore also borrowed the guitar riff from Parker&#x27;s &quot;Love My Baby&quot;, played by Pat Hare.
* &quot;Gee&quot; by the Crows was recorded on February 10, 1953. This was a big hit in 1954 in the Doo-wop genre, but crossed over to the pop charts, and is credited by rock n&#x27; roll authority Jay Warner, as being among &quot;the first rock n&#x27; roll records&quot;. 
* &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; by Bill Haley and his Comets, recorded in April 1953, was the first of his recordings to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart. This was not a cover, but an original composition, and has been described &quot;the first rock and roll song to be a hit on the pop charts&quot; although the term rockabilly might be more accurate. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame considers the song &quot;an original amalgam of country and R&amp;B that arguably became the first rock and roll record to register on Billboard&#x27;s pop chart&quot;.
* &quot;Mess Around&quot; by Ray Charles was recorded in May 1953, one of his earliest hits. The writing credit was claimed by Ahmet Ertegun, with some lyrics riffing off of the 1929 classic &quot;Pinetop&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Woman&quot;, recorded in November 1954 and first performed when Charles was on tour with T-Bone Walker, was a bigger hit, widely considered to be the first soul song, combining gospel with R&amp;B; its tune was derived from the gospel song &quot;My Jesus Is All the World to Me&quot; by Alex Bradford.
* &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot; by Guitar Slim was recorded on October 16, 1953. It was an electric blues song that had a major impact on rock and roll and featured distorted overtones on the electric guitar a full decade before Jimi Hendrix. It is listed as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.
* &quot;Work with Me, Annie&quot; by Hank Ballard and The Midnighters, was recorded on January 14, 1954. Despite, or because of, its salacious lyrics, it was immediately successful in the R&amp;B market, topping the R&amp;B chart for seven weeks, and led to several sequels, including Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Annie Had a Baby&quot; and Etta James&#x27; first hit &quot;The Wallflower&quot;, also known as &quot;Roll with Me, Henry&quot;. Although the records were banned from radio play and led to calls for rock and roll to be banned, the lyrics were soon rewritten for a more conservative white audience, and Georgia Gibbs topped the pop charts in 1955 with her version &quot;Dance with Me, Henry&quot;.
* &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; by Big Joe Turner was recorded on February 15, 1954, and reached number one on the Billboard R&amp;B chart in June and number 22 on the Billboard singles chart. It was covered early in July by Bill Haley and his Comets; this version, which substantially was different in lyric and arrangement, reached no. 7 in the pop chart at the end of August and predated his much wider success with &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by almost a year. Elvis Presley&#x27;s later 1956 version combined Haley&#x27;s arrangement with Turner&#x27;s lyrics, but was not a substantial hit.
* &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley and His Comets (recorded on April 12, 1954) was the first no. 1 rock and roll record on the US pop charts. It stayed in the Top 100 for a then-record 38 weeks. The record is often credited with propelling rock into the mainstream, at least the teen mainstream. At first it had lackluster sales but, following the success of two other Haley recordings, &quot;Shake Rattle and Roll&quot; and &quot;Dim, Dim the Lights&quot;, was later included in the movie &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; about a raucous high-school, which exposed it to a wider audience and took it to worldwide success in 1955. Eventually, the recording sold a total of 6 million copies. The song itself had first been recorded in late 1953 by Sonny Dae &amp; His Knights, a novelty group whose recording had become a modest local hit at the time Haley recorded his version. 
* James Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; and Pat Hare&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Murder My Baby&quot; (both recorded in May 1954), were electric blues records which feature heavily distorted, power chord-driven electric guitar solos by Pat Hare that anticipate elements of heavy metal music. The other side of Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Crop Blues&quot; single &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot; also featured a heavily distorted guitar sound by Hare that resembles the &quot;distorted tones favored by modern rock players.&quot;
* &quot;That&#x27;s All Right, Mama&quot; by Elvis Presley was recorded on July 5, 1954. This cover of Arthur Crudup&#x27;s tune was Presley&#x27;s first single. The Presley version was not identical to Crudup&#x27;s since it was &quot;at least twice as fast as the original&quot;. Its B-side was a rocking version of Bill Monroe&#x27;s bluegrass song &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;, recognized by various rock singers as an influence on the music. Presley&#x27;s version turned &quot;it from a waltz to a bluesy rocker&quot;.

==Views on the first rock and roll record ==
The identity of the first rock and roll record is one of the most enduring subjects of debate among rock historians. Various recordings dating back to the 1940s and 1950s have been cited as the first rock and roll record. A number of sources have considered the first to be &quot;Rocket 88&quot;, which was recorded in 1951 by Ike Turner&#x27;s band, but credited to his saxophonist and the song&#x27;s vocalist Jackie Brenston. Turner led the band but provided no vocals for &quot;Rocket 88&quot;. The identity of the writer of the song remains in dispute. Brenston said that &quot;they had simply borrowed from another jump blues about an automobile, Jimmy Liggins’ &#x27;Cadillac Boogie. Turner continued to maintain that he wrote the music and that he and the band jointly wrote the lyrics.

According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Joan Anderman, most rock historians cite &quot;Rocket 88&quot; as the first, while &quot;The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and the website of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said that it is &quot;frequently cited&quot; and &quot;widely considered the first&quot;, respectively. People in the music industry have also called it the first, among several others. &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is cited for its forceful backbeat and unrefined, distorted electric guitar. By contrast, writer and musician Michael Campbell wrote that, &quot;from our perspective,&quot; it was not the first rock and roll record because it had a shuffle beat rather than the rock rhythm originally characteristic in Chuck Berry&#x27;s and Little Richard&#x27;s songs, although he added that &quot;Rocket 88&quot; had basic characteristics of rock music such as the emphasis on guitar and distortion. Its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated. Nigel Williamson questions whether it was really an R&amp;B song &quot;with an unusually fast, bottom-heavy eight-to-the bar boogie rhythm and a great lyric about cars, booze and women&quot;.

The music historian Robert Palmer wrote that Goree Carter&#x27;s earlier 1949 song &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; is a &quot;much more appropriate candidate&quot; than &quot;the more frequently cited&quot; &quot;Rocket 88&quot;. 
In Palmer&#x27;s view, that is because of the presence of loud electric guitar work on the former song. Palmer wrote that &quot;Rocket 88&quot; is credited for its raucous saxophone, boogie-woogie beat, fuzzy amplified guitar, and lyrics that celebrate the automobile. However, he regards &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; to be a more appropriate candidate for the &quot;first rock and roll record&quot; title, because it was recorded two years earlier, and because of Carter&#x27;s guitar work bearing a striking resemblance to Chuck Berry&#x27;s later guitar work, while making use of an over-driven amplifier, along with the backing of boogie-based rhythms, and the appropriate title and lyrical subject matter. Roger Wood and John Nova Lomax also have cited &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; as the first rock &amp; roll record. Others have taken the view that the first was Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, or Wynonie Harris&#x27; 1948 version; the song received greater exposure when Elvis Presley covered it in 1954. Sister Rosetta Tharpe&#x27;s 1944 recording of &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot; has also been viewed as among the first.

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame considers Chuck Berry to have been particularly significant in the origins of the genre. &quot;While no individual can be said to have invented rock and roll ... Chuck Berry came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together&quot;.

Most rock historians have cited Bill Haley&#x27;s 1953 song &quot;Crazy Man, Crazy&quot; as the first rock and roll record to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; released in 1954 was the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre. Along with &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, several rock critics also have pointed to Presley&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; from 1954 as a candidate for the first rock and roll record.

The 1992 book &quot;What Was the First Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Record?&quot; by Jim Dawson and Steve Propes discusses 50 contenders, from Illinois Jacquet&#x27;s &quot;Blues, Part 2&quot; (1944) to Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (1956), without reaching a definitive conclusion. In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was set by disc jockey Alan Freed&#x27;s use of the term in his groundbreaking &quot;The Rock and Roll Show&quot; on New York&#x27;s WINS in late 1954, as well as at his &quot;Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls&quot; at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&amp;B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&amp;B style (Bill Haley, Elvis Presley). The artists who appeared at Freed&#x27;s earliest shows included orchestra leader Buddy Johnson, the Clovers, Fats Domino, Big Joe Turner, the Moonglows, Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters, and the Harptones. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by Illinois Jacquet with Jazz at the Philharmonic in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, &quot;Blues, Part 2,&quot; was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on &quot;Blues&quot;, including Les Paul and Nat King Cole, who used the pseudonyms 
Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine respectively.

In 2004, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s All Right Mama&quot; and Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; both celebrated their 50th anniversaries. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that Presley&#x27;s song was the first rock and roll recording. At the time, Presley recorded Big Joe Turner&#x27;s &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot;, later covered by Haley, which was already at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts. &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt that while there were rock and roll records before Presley&#x27;s, his recording was the moment when all the strands came together in &quot;perfect embodiment&quot;. Presley said: &quot;A lot of people seem to think I started this business, but rock and roll was here a long time before I came along.&quot;

Also formative in the sound of rock and roll were Little Richard and Chuck Berry. From the early 1950s, Little Richard combined gospel with New Orleans R&amp;B, heavy backbeat, pounding piano and wailing vocals. Ray Charles referred to Little Richard as being the artist that started a new kind of music, which was a funky style of rock and roll that he was performing onstage for a few years before appearing on record in 1955 as &quot;Tutti Frutti.&quot; Chuck Berry, with &quot;Maybellene&quot; (recorded on May 21, 1955, and which reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart and no. 5 on the US pop chart), &quot;Roll over Beethoven&quot; (1956), &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1957) and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing guitar intros and lead breaks that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. Early rock and roll used the twelve-bar blues chord progression and shared with boogie woogie the four beats (usually broken down into eight eighth-notes/quavers) to a bar. Rock and roll, however, has a greater emphasis on the backbeat than boogie woogie. Bo Diddley&#x27;s 1955 hit &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;, with its B-side &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, introduced a new beat and unique guitar style that inspired many artists without either side using the 12-bar pattern – they instead played variations on a single chord each. His more insistent, driving rhythms, hard-edged electric guitar sound, African rhythms, and signature clave beat (a simple, five-accent rhythm), have remained cornerstones of rock and pop.

Others point out that performers like Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino were recording blues songs as early as 1946 that are indistinguishable from later rock and roll, and that these blues songs were based on themes, chord changes, and rhythms dating back decades before that. Wynonie Harris&#x27; 1947 cover of Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot; is also a claimant for the title of first rock and roll record, as the popularity of this record led to many answer songs, mostly by black artists, with the same rocking beat, during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Big Joe Turner&#x27;s 1939 recording &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; is close to 1950s rock and roll. Sister Rosetta Tharpe also was recording shouting, stomping music in the 1930s and 1940s, including &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot; (1944), which contained major elements of mid-1950s rock and roll. Pushing the date back even earlier, blues researcher Gayle Dean Wardlow has stated that &quot;Crazy About My Baby&quot; by Blind Roosevelt Graves and his brother, recorded in 1929, &quot;could be considered the first rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll recording&quot;.

By contrast, musician and writer Billy Vera argued that because rock and roll was &quot;an evolutionary process&quot;, it would be foolish to name any single record as the first. Writer Nick Tosches similarly felt that, &quot;It is impossible to discern the first modern rock record, just as it is impossible to discern where blue becomes indigo in the spectrum.&quot; Music writer Rob Bowman remarked that the long-debated question is useless and cannot be answered because &quot;criteria vary depending upon who is making the selection.&quot;

Fats Domino was not convinced that he was singing rock and roll music. In 1956, he offered this comment on his work: &quot;What they call rock and roll is rhythm and blues, and I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans.&quot;
Ike Turner offers another perspective, imagining Sam Philips&#x27; plan as follows: if I get me a white boy to sound like a black boy, then I got me a gold mine’, which is the truth&quot;. Ike&#x27;s story continues: &quot;So, that&#x27;s when he got Elvis and he got Jerry Lee Lewis and a bunch of other guys and so they named it rock and roll rather than R&amp;B... and so this is the reason I think rock and roll exists&quot;.

<text>[[Baron]] was a Japanese admiral in the early days of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

==Biography==
Dewa was born as the son of a &quot;samurai&quot; of the Aizu domain (present day Fukushima prefecture). As a youth, he enlisted in the &quot;Byakkotai,&quot; a reserve unit of the Aizu domain&#x27;s official military. The &quot;Byakkotai&quot; was called into action, and Dewa served at the Battle of Aizu in the Boshin War.

Dewa attended the 5th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, graduating 6th out of 43 cadets. He was appointed a midshipman on 16 August 1878, promoted to ensign on 12 August 1880 and promoted to sub-lieutenant on 27 February 1883. He served as a junior officer on several vessels of the early Japanese Navy, including the corvette , ironclad warship , sloop &quot;Hōshō&quot;, ironclad warship , corvette , and cruisers , and . He was promoted to lieutenant on 7 April 1886 and to lieutenant-commander on 16 October 1890. From 1886-1890, he was executive officer on the cruiser . From 1893-1893, he was captain of the gunboats , and and was promoted in rank to captain on 7 December 1894.

During the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), Dewa served as a staff officer of the &quot;Western Seas Fleet&quot;, a defensive force patrolling home waters. In 1893, he became Director of the Personnel Section in the Navy Ministry. He later captained the cruiser in 1898.

Promoted to rear admiral on 20 May 1900, and vice admiral on 6 June 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War he was a commander of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron of the IJN 1st Fleet and took part in the naval Battle of Port Arthur, and the Battle of the Yellow Sea, (where he commanded from the cruiser ). During the decisive Battle of Tsushima he led the Third Squadron from his flagship, the cruiser .

In December 1905, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the IJN 3rd Fleet, and from November 1906 was Director of the Naval Education Bureau.

On 3 December 1907, Dewa was elevated to the peerage with the title of &quot;danshaku&quot; (baron) under the &quot;kazoku&quot; system.

Later, he was successively Commander-in-Chief of the IJN 2nd Fleet, Sasebo Naval District, and the IJN 1st Fleet.

On 9 July 1912, he was promoted to full admiral. Dewa Shigeto was the first non-Satsuma person (and the first Aizu person) to attain the rank of full admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The first person of Aizu background to attain the rank of admiral was Hidematsu Tsunoda, and Matsudaira Morio the son of the former Aizu lord Matsudaira Katamori as a rear admiral.

On the occasion of the Siemens-Vickers Navy Armament Scandal, as Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry he concentrated his efforts on the cleanup of corruption from the Navy. This eventually led to the fall of Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohyōe&#x27;s cabinet in March 1914. Dewa retired from active service in 1925.

In his later years, Dewa was involved with the construction of memorials to the casualties of the Battle of Aizu. His grave is at the Aoyama Cemetery in Tokyo.

<doc id="944651" wikidata="Q2580536" url="?curid=944651" title="William Shawn">
<text>William Shawn (&quot;né&quot; Chon; August 31, 1907 – December 8, 1992) was an American magazine editor who edited &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from 1952 until 1987.

==Early life and education==
Shawn was born William Chon on August 31, 1907, in Chicago, Illinois, to Benjamin T. Chon, a cutlery salesman, and Anna Bransky Chon. He was the youngest of five. His older siblings were Harold (1892-1967), Melba (1894-1964), Nelson (1898-1974), and Myron (1902-1987). His family were non-observant Jews from Eastern Europe. William dropped out of the University of Michigan after two years (1925-1927) and began working.

==Career==

===Early years===
Shawn traveled to Las Vegas, New Mexico, where he worked at the local newspaper, &quot;The Optic&quot;. He returned to Chicago and worked as a journalist. Around 1930 he changed the spelling of his last name to &quot;Shawn&quot;. In 1932, he and his wife, Cecille, moved to New York City, where he tried to start a career as a composer.

===At &quot;The New Yorker&quot;===
Soon after their arrival in New York City, Cecille took a fact checking job at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, and her husband began working there in 1933. His temperament contrasted with that of the magazine&#x27;s founder Harold Ross. Colleagues later described him as &quot;shy&quot;, &quot;deferential&quot;, having a &quot;strange presence&quot;. Lillian Ross recalled that Shawn believed in the value of every life, even that of Hitler. Shawn stayed with the magazine for 53 years.

====As assistant editor====
Shawn rose to assistant editor of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and oversaw the magazine&#x27;s coverage of World War II. He had been trying to get a story out of John Hersey for years. After &quot;Life&quot; magazine rejected Hersey&#x27;s profile of future president John F. Kennedy, Shawn seized the opportunity. The story ran in &quot;The&quot; &quot;New Yorker&quot; and was reprinted in the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of copies were distributed during Kennedy&#x27;s campaigns for the U.S. House of Representatives and the presidency. In 1946, Shawn persuaded Ross to run Hersey&#x27;s story about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima as the entire contents of one issue. He left for a few months shortly after that to write on his own, but soon returned.

====As editor====
A few weeks after Ross died in December 1951, Shawn was named editor. His quiet style was a marked contrast to Ross&#x27;s noisy manner. Whereas Ross constantly wrote letters to his contributors, Shawn hated to share anything, especially on paper. His shyness was office (and New York) legend, as were his claustrophobia and fear of elevators; many of his colleagues maintain that he carried a hatchet in his briefcase, in case he became trapped.

Shawn would buy articles and then not run them for years, if ever. Staff members were given offices and salaries even if they produced little for the magazine; Joseph Mitchell, whose work had appeared regularly during the 1950s and early 1960s, continued to come to his office from 1965 until his death in 1996 without ever publishing another word. Shawn gave writers vast space to cover their subjects, and nearly all of them (including Dwight Macdonald, Hannah Arendt, and England&#x27;s Kenneth Tynan) spoke reverently of him. J. D. Salinger adored him, and dedicated &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; to Shawn.

While &quot;The Addams Family&quot; comics debuted in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1938, Shawn banned them from the publication following the release of the 1964 TV series, as he did not want the image of his publication associated with a mainstream sitcom. The ban remained in effect long after the TV series concluded, persisting until Shawn&#x27;s retirement in 1987.

====Later years====

When Advance Publications bought the magazine in 1985, the new owners promised that the magazine&#x27;s editorship would not change hands until Shawn chose to retire. But speculation about his successor, a longtime topic of publishing-world chatter, grew.

Shawn had been editor for a very long time, and the usual criticism of the magazine—that it had become stale and dull—was growing more pointed. In retrospect, the journalist Joseph Nocera described him as &quot;legendary, if wildly overrated.&quot; Advance chairman S.I. Newhouse forced Shawn out in February 1987, and—after reportedly telling Shawn that he would honor his request to name his deputy Charles McGrath to succeed him—replaced Shawn with Robert Gottlieb, the editor-in-chief at the well-regarded book publisher Alfred A. Knopf.

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; executive producer Lorne Michaels, a longtime admirer, gave Shawn office space in the Brill Building, and he soon took an editorship at Farrar, Straus and Giroux, a largely honorary post that he held until his death in 1992.

==Awards and achievements==
In 1988, Shawn received the George Polk Career Award in recognition of his lifelong achievements.

==Personal life==
Shawn married journalist Cecille Lyon (1906–2005) in 1928, and the couple had three children: writer and actor Wallace Shawn, and twins Allen Shawn and Mary. Mary, who was eventually diagnosed with autism, was sent away from the family when she was eight years old to attend a special school, and later institutionalized. Allen became a composer. In 2007, he published a memoir, &quot;Wish I Could Be There&quot;, centering on his phobias. In 2010, he published a memoir, &quot;Twin,&quot; about his childhood and his relationship with his sister.

In 1996, Shawn&#x27;s longtime &quot;New Yorker&quot; colleague Lillian Ross wrote in a memoir that she and Shawn had had an affair from 1950 until his death, with Lyon&#x27;s knowledge. Ross said that Shawn was also active in raising her adopted son, Erik. The memoir&#x27;s publication was controversial, in part because Shawn deeply valued his privacy.

==Influences and legacy==
* In 1998, Indian author Ved Mehta, who worked with Shawn at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for almost three decades, published a biography of Shawn, &quot;Remembering Mr. Shawn&#x27;s New Yorker: The Invisible Art of Editing&quot;.

==In popular culture==
* Shawn was portrayed in the 2005 film &quot;Capote&quot; by Bob Balaban and in the 2012 film &quot;Hannah Arendt&quot; by Nicholas Woodeson.

<text>The Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts (; , HAZU) is the national academy of Croatia.

HAZU was founded under the patronage of the Croatian bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer under the name Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (, JAZU) since its founder wanted to make it the central scientific and artistic institution of all South Slavs. Today, its main goals are encouraging and organizing scientific work, applying the achieved results, developing of artistic and cultural activities, carrying about the Croatian cultural heritage and its affirmation in the world, publishing the results of scientific research and artistic creativity and giving suggestions and opinions for the advancement of science and art in areas of particular importance to Croatia.

The academy is divided into nine classes; social sciences, mathematical, physical and chemical sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, philological sciences, Literature, Fine Arts, Musical Arts and Musicology, technical sciences. The academy started in 1866 with 16 full members which grew to today&#x27;s 160. Besides full, members can also be honorary, corresponding or associate.

== History ==
The institution was founded in Zagreb on 29 April 1861 by the decision of the Croatian Parliament (Sabor) as the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts. The bishop and benefactor Josip Juraj Strossmayer, a prominent advocate of higher education during the 19th century Croatian national romanticism, set up a trust fund for this purpose and in 1860 submitted a large donation to the then viceroy (ban) of Croatia Josip Šokčević for the cause of being able to
After some years of deliberations by the Croatian Parliament and the emperor Franz Joseph, it was finally sanctioned by law in 1866. The official sponsor was Josip Juraj Strossmayer, while the first chairman of the academy was the distinguished Croatian historian Franjo Rački. Serbian linguist Đuro Daničić was elected secretary general of the academy, where he played a key role in preparing the academy&#x27;s dictionary, the &quot;Croatian or Serbian Dictionary of JAZU&quot;.

The academy&#x27;s creation was the logical extension of the University of Zagreb, the institution initially created in 1669 and also renewed by bishop Strossmayer in 1874. Bishop Strossmayer also initiated the building of the Academy Palace in the Zrinjevac park of Zagreb, and the Palace was completed in 1880. In 1884, the palace also became a host of the Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters that contained 256 works of art (mostly paintings). The same is today one of the most prominent art galleries in Zagreb.

The academy started publishing the academic journal &quot;Rad&quot; in 1867. In 1882, each of the individual scientific classes of the academy started printing their own journals. In 1887, the academy published the first &quot;Ljetopis&quot; as a year book, as well as several other publications in history and ethnology.

Vatroslav Jagić, Baltazar Bogišić, Nikola Tesla, Mihailo Petrović, Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger, Andrija Mohorovičić, Ivan Meštrović, Lavoslav Ružička, Vladimir Prelog, Ivo Andrić, Miroslav Krleža, Ivan Supek and Franjo Tuđman were JAZU/HAZU members.

=== Name changes ===

The academy briefly changed name from &quot;Yugoslav&quot; to &quot;Croatian&quot; between 1941 and 1945 during the Axis client regime of the Independent State of Croatia.

It has again been renamed &quot;Croatian&quot; in 1991 after Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia.

== Departments ==

The academy is divided into nine departments (classes):
* Department of Social Sciences
* Department of Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Sciences
* Department of Natural Sciences
* Department of Medical Sciences
* Department of Philological Sciences
* Department of Literature
* Department of Fine Arts
* Department of Music and Musicology
* Department of Technical Sciences

===The Institute for Historical Sciences===
One of the research units of the academy is the Institute for Historical Sciences. It is located in a Renaissance villa in Dubrovnik, and holds a rich manuscript and library collection. Two peer-reviewed journals are published by the institute, which are fully available online: &quot;Anali&quot; in Croatian and &quot;Dubrovnik Annals&quot; in English.

===The institute for Ornithology===
The Institute for Ornithology houses the Croatian bird ringing scheme, and is a member of the European Union for Bird Ringing (EURING).

== Membership ==

There are four classes of members:

*Full members
*Associate members
*Honorary members
*Corresponding members

The number of full members and corresponding members is limited to 160 each, while the maximum number of associate members is 100. Number of full members per department is limited to 24. Only the full members may carry the title of &quot;academician&quot; (, (male members) or (female members)).

== Chairmen ==
== Criticism ==

The academy has been criticized to the effect that membership and activities are based on academic cronyism and political favor rather than on scientific and artistic merit. In 2006 matters came to a head with the academy&#x27;s refusal to induct Dr. Miroslav Radman, an accomplished biologist, a member of the French Academy of Sciences, and an advocate of a higher degree of meritocracy and accountability in Croatian academia. His supporters within the academy and the media decried the decision as reinforcing a politically motivated, unproductive &quot;status quo&quot;.

Dr. Ivo Banac, a Yale University professor and then a deputy in the Croatian parliament, addressed the chamber in a speech decrying a &quot;dictatorship of mediocrity&quot; in the academy, while &quot;Globus&quot; columnist Boris Dežulović satirized the institution as an &quot;academy of stupidity and obedience&quot;. Dr. Vladimir Paar and others defended the academy&#x27;s decision, averring that it did take pains to include accomplished scientists but that, since Dr. Radman&#x27;s work has mostly taken place outside Croatia, it was appropriate that he remain a corresponding rather than a full member of the academy.

Nenad Ban, a distinguished molecular biologist from ETH Zurich and a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina is only a corresponding member of HAZU. Ivan Đikić, a molecular biologist working at the Goethe University Frankfurt, and also a member of Leopoldina since 2010, has not been able to join HAZU even as a corresponding member, despite being the most cited Croatian scientist, with more citations than the academy&#x27;s 18-member Department of Medical Sciences combined.

From 2005 to 2007, the Department of Philological Sciences at the academy released several declarations on the linguistic situation in Croatia, which were criticised for being nationalistically motivated rather than linguistically based. Despite pressure from members of the Department of Philological Sciences, one journal refused to stop publishing criticism.

In May 2022, the academy published a document outlining conditions for Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s entry into the European Union, calling for a third Croat entity to be implemented in the country due to the rising challenges faced by Croats from &quot;Serbian secessionist and Bosniak unitarist&quot; policies. It also proposed conditions to be fulfilled by Serbia and Montenegro before they joined the EU. It has been criticized by analysts for its ethno-nationalist and political nature and has drawn comparisons to the controversial SANU memorandum.

== Restitution of Nazi-looted art ==
In 2023 the museum restituted to the heirs of Dane Reichsmann artworks that had been looted, including André Derain&#x27;s “Still Life With a Bottle” and Maurice de Vlaminck&#x27;s “Landscape by the Water,” as well as lithographs by Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Paul Cézanne and Pierre Bonnard.

<text>The European Short Course Swimming Championships, variously referred to informally as the &quot;Short Course Europeans&quot; or &quot;European 25m Championships&quot;, are a swimming meet, organized by LEN. The meet features swimmers from Europe, competing in events in a short course (25-meter) pool. The meet has traditionally been held in the beginning of December. Annual until 2013, the event now occurs in odd years.

==History==
The championships were first held in 1996, and were preceded by the &quot;European Sprint Swimming Championships&quot; which were held from 1991 to 1994. The &quot;Sprint&quot; meet featured 14 events: the 50 metres of the strokes, the 100 metres individual medley, and 4 × 50 metres relays (freestyle and medley).

In 1996, the meet expanded to 38 events, adding the 100 metres and 200 metres of each stroke, the 400 metres, the men&#x27;s 1500 metres freestyle and women&#x27;s 800 metres freestyle events, and the 200 and 400 metres individual medley events; and the name was changed from &quot;Sprint&quot; to &quot;Short Course&quot;. LEN also started numbering the championships again, such that 2011&#x27;s meet was the 15th edition. In 2012, the meet expanded to 40 events: 19 for men, 19 for women, and two mixed. Of each 19 events, 17 are individual and two are relays.

<doc id="944674" wikidata="Q13386767" url="?curid=944674" title="Carabinier">
<text>A carabinier (also sometimes spelled carabineer or carbineer) is in principle a soldier armed with a carbine, musket, or rifle, which became commonplace by the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe. The word is derived from the identical French word &quot;&quot;.

Historically, carabiniers were generally (but not always) horse soldiers. The carbine was considered a more appropriate firearm for a horseman than a full-length musket, since it was shorter in length, weighed less, and was easier to manipulate on horseback. Light infantry sometimes carried carbines because they are less encumbering when moving rapidly, especially through vegetation, but in most armies the tendency was to equip light infantry with longer-range weapons such as rifles rather than shorter-range weapons such as carbines. In Italy and Spain, carbines were considered suitable equipment for soldiers with policing roles, so the term &quot;carabinier&quot; evolved to sometimes denote gendarmes and border guards.

Today, the term is used by some countries in military, law enforcement, and gendarmerie roles.

==Background==

Carabiniers differed from army to army and over time, but typically were medium cavalry, similar in armament and tactical role to dragoons.

Napoleon inherited two French carabinier regiments of heavy cavalry (the two most senior cavalry regiments in the army), which gained some prestige in his wars. In 1810, French Carabiniers were equipped like cuirassiers, with helmets and cuirasses (though these were of brass and brass-skinned iron), and they were no longer issued carbines. The French army has no carabinier regiments today. The British army raised regiments of carabiniers in the late 17th century. The descendants of one such regiment survived as the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Dragoon Guards) until 1971, when it was amalgamated with the Royal Scots Greys. Accordingly, no regiment bears the title today, although the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards are sub-titled &quot;Carabiniers and Greys&quot;.

Italy has a famous force of carabiniers, a gendarmerie known by the Italian name &quot;Carabinieri&quot;. Chile also has a force of gendarme carabiniers, the Carabineros de Chile, and the National Police of Colombia has mobile road-based units called Mobile Carabinier Squadrons. The Belgian Land Component includes a &quot;Regiment des Carabiniers&quot;, which saw service against the German invaders in August 1914 still dressed in its 19th century uniform complete with a form of top hat. The Spanish Army formerly maintained a corps of &quot;Carabineros&quot; who served as frontier guards. This force was, however, disbanded following the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939 and replaced by units of the Civil Guard.

==Infantry Carabiniers==
The use of carabinier to refer to infantry troops comes from the French light infantry battalions of 1794, where it denoted troops of the elite company known as grenadiers in line infantry.

Other infantry units with the title of carabiniers included:
* The military of Monaco includes an infantry unit called the &quot;Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince&quot;, which has been active since at least 1817.
* In the Imperial Russian Army during the Napoleonic wars, the sections on the right flank of &quot;yeger&quot; battalions deployed in line were called carabiniers.
** Quite apart from the elite &quot;yeger&quot; platoons, foot carabinier regiments existed for a brief time after 12 February 1816 when the six grenadier-yeger Regiments were renamed as carabiniers. These included the oldest regular infantry regiment in the Russian Army, the Yerivan Leib-Grenadier regiment as the former 7th Carabinier Regiment. Foot Carabinier regiments were renamed rifles () in 1857 following the Crimean War.
* Bavarian Volunteer Jäger Corps in 1813

* The Belgian &quot;Chasseurs&quot; included an infantry &quot;Regiment des Carabiniers&quot;, which saw service against the German Army in August 1914 still dressed in its 19th century uniform complete with a form of top hat. Following a merger in 1992, the unit became the Regiment Carabiniers Prins Boudewijn – Grenadiers.
* Waldeck, Lippe-Detmold, Shaumburg-Lippe contingents in the 2nd battalion, 6th Rheinbund Regiment of the Confederation of the Rhine.
* Nassau 2nd Light Infantry Regiment
* &quot;Legion Irlandaise&quot; (Irish Legion) in French service
* Westphalian &quot;voltigeurs-carabiniers&quot; created by Jérôme Bonaparte, and after 1811 renamed &quot;Jäger Carabinier d&#x27;Elite&quot;
* Papal States &quot;Carabinieri indigeni&quot; formed from Italian recruits, and &quot;Carabinieri esteri&quot; formed from foreign recruits
* Kingdom of Italy under Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais (1805–1814) had &quot;Velites&quot; Carabiniers of the Guard.
* One of the three light infantry battalions of the reorganised Royal Spanish Army in 1812 was called Carabiniers.

==Mounted Carabiniers==

===Royal Spanish carabineros===

Although the Spanish Crown was the first to raise carbine armed cavalry regiments, the Spanish Army is not known for its cavalry carabiniers. The &quot;la Brigada de Carabineros Reales&quot;, though dressed as hussars, did however participate in several of Spain&#x27;s wars, including the Peninsular War against Napoleon (part of the Napoleonic Wars), where they distinguished themselves at Sepúlveda (28 November 1808), along with the Alcántara and Montesa cavalry regiments, against Lasalle&#x27;s French 10th Chasseurs à cheval and 9th Dragoons. One notable officer serving with the brigade was Carlos María de Alvear. The regiment, along with the cavalry of the Spanish Royal Guard, was reformed at Valladolid by General Gregorio García de la Cuesta by which time they were numbered scarcely more than a squadron, and were given the pick of some 5,000 volunteers. They later participated in the Carlist Wars, notably at Bilbao. See also the separate section on the frontier guard Carabineros of the Spanish Army below.

===French Carabiniers-à-Cheval===
In 1690, one company of carabiniers was maintained in each regiment of the French army&#x27;s cavalry. Their duties were analogous to those of grenadiers in infantry regiments: scouting, detached work, and, in general, all duties requiring special activity and address. They fought mounted and dismounted alike, and even took part in siege warfare in the trenches. The French carabiniers were mentioned at the battle of Neerwinden in 1693 commanded by Prince de Conti. Although their original role was that of a mounted police similar to the Gendarmes, as combat troops they first took the form of separate companies within each cavalry regiments on 29 October 1691 under Louis XIV. Only later was an independent regiment or &quot;cavalerie de reserve&quot; established in 1693 under the command of Duc du Maine. However at that time all French cavalry other than the gendarmes were called light cavalry, and their first name was &quot;Corps royal des carabiniers&quot;, organised by brigading of four squadrons commanded by a lieutenant-colonel.

The Corps was enlarged to ten squadrons by the start of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Their depot was in Strasbourg, where it remained for a century. On 13 May 1758, the Corps was renamed &quot;Royal carabiniers de monsieur le Comte de Provence&quot;. By 1762, the Corps was enlarged to five brigades of thirty squadrons, but was reduced to two regiments in 1788. However, the events of the French Revolution affected all of the French Army and the cavalry Arm in particular, and the carabiniers were reduced to two regiments of four squadrons each, later serving in the Army of the Rhine. The regiments retained their distinctive bearskin headwear until 1810 when it was replaced by even more distinctive helmets with scarlet combs. They were also distinguished by Napoleon with a brass overlay on the iron cuirasses after suffering heavy casualties in the 1809 campaign, but were no longer equipped with carbines.

The two Carabiniers regiments, brigaded together and as a part of General of Division Nansouty&#x27;s 1st Heavy Cavalry Division saw action during the Napoleonic wars, including in the Battle of Austerlitz, Battle of Friedland, Battle of Wagram, Battle of Borodino (commanded by General of Brigade Defrance), Battle of Leipzig, Battle of Laon, and Battle of Waterloo. The Carabiniers were restored as a single &quot;régiment de Monsieur&quot; after the second Bourbon restoration.

By 1814, there were two regiments of Carabiniers with their distinctive style of helmet, which was temporarily adopted by the cuirassiers. The Carabiniers were present in Paris in June 1848 for the creation of the Republic, when nine regiments were brought in to maintain peace, the first time in 200 years that carabiniers were again serving as military police. From 1852 the Carabiniers were a part of the Army of the Second French Empire, but did not serve in the Crimean War. In 1870, they saw service again as a single regiment, but now as part of the Imperial Guard. Following the Franco-Prussian War, the Carabiniers were amalgamated with the 11th Cuirassier regiment on 4 February 1871.

The 1-11e Régiment de Cuirassiers of the modern French Army can accordingly trace its origin, in part, to the 19th Century Carabiniers. By coincidence the present day regiment is stationed in Carpiagne within Provence, once the domain of their former commander.

===British Carabiniers===
The Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards) was a cavalry regiment of the British Army. The regiment was descended from the &quot;Ninth Horse regiment&quot;, raised in response to the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s rebellion in 1685, the first year of the reign of King James II. Colonelcy of the Ninth Horse was given to Richard, 2nd Viscount Lumley of Waterford. In accordance with tradition of the time, the regiment became known as &quot;Lord Lumley&#x27;s Horse&quot;. In 1691, during King William&#x27;s Irish Campaign, the regiment distinguished itself, as a result of which it was posted to London and renamed The King&#x27;s Carabiniers. However, in 1741 the regiment became known as the 3rd Regiment of Horse, and in 1756 became the 3rd Horse. Through the Napoleonic Wars period the regiment was called the 6th Dragoon Guards, becoming 3rd Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) in 1826. In 1920, the regiment briefly became known as The Carabiniers (6th Dragoon Guards) again before being amalgamated in 1922. Although the regiment&#x27;s first battle honour is for the Battle of Blenheim, it did not take a notable part in any major battle of the British Army during the Napoleonic Wars, but did serve in the Crimean War. The regiment also served in the Boer Wars, although by far most of its battle honours come from the First World War. Known in the British Army as &quot;The Carbs&quot;, the regiment survived as the 3rd Carabiniers (Prince of Wales&#x27;s Dragoon Guards) until 1971 when it was amalgamated with the Royal Scots Greys during the Palace of Holyrood House parade in July 1971. In attendance was Her Majesty The Queen, who is the regimental Colonel-in-Chief. At the same time the role of the regiment changed from cavalry to mechanised infantry. As a result of the amalgamation, no regiment bears the title of Carabiniers in the British Army today, although the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards are sub-titled &quot;Carabiniers and Greys&quot;.

There also existed the Hampshire Carabiniers as a Yeomanry cavalry regiment that was formed during the French Revolutionary Wars, and remained known as the Carabiniers late in the Victorian era. The regiment served in the Boer Wars, and the First World War, after which the Hampshire Yeomanry was re-roled as an Artillery Regiment and then amalgamated with the Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery to become the 95th (Hampshire Yeomanry) Field Brigade, Royal Artillery.

===Saxon Carabiniers===
The Saxon Carabiniers were formed after the reorganisation of the Royal Saxon Army in 1765, and survived in the Imperial German Army until 1918. The regiment was known to have used lances in its pre-First World War service.

===Prussian carabiniers===
* Life Carabinier Regiment ()
* von der Marwitzsches Volunteer Corps 1807, Carabiniers of the Uhlan Squadron

===Netherlands karabiniers===
The Dutch mounted karabiniers date back to 2nd (Heavy) Cavalry regiment raised in the 1680s, however they briefly ceased to exist during the period of the Batavian Republic.
The Allied order of battle at the Battle of Waterloo included the Netherlands Cavalry Division (Divisie Cavalerie) commanded by Lieutenant-Generaal Jean Alphonse Baron de Collaert, which, in turn, included a brigade of three Karabinier regiments newly raised from the cuirassiers of the Dutch contribution to the Napoleonic La Grande Armée:
*1st Heavy Cavalry Brigade (Brigade Zware Cavalerie) Generaal-Majoor Jonkheer A. D. Trip
: 1st Carabiniers (Regiment karabiniers No. 1) Luitenant-Kolonel L. P. Coenegracht 
: 2nd Carabiniers (Regiment karabiniers No. 2) Kolonel J. B. de Bruijn
: 3rd Carabiniers (Regiment karabiniers No. 3) Luitenant-Kolonel C. M. Lechleitner
All three regiments along with the dragoons of the Guard became dragoons in 1849.

===Russian Karabinery===

Carabiniers first appeared in the Russian Army during the reign of Catherine II in 1763, and eventually numbered sixteen regiments. However, Emperor Paul I, who intensely disliked any reminder of his mother’s reign, renamed six into dragoons and the remainder into cuirassiers. The carabiniers did return to the Russian cavalry after 1803 as the four select marksmen called flankers in each platoon armed with carbines in all cavalry regiments for the first part of Napoleonic wars, before being reinvented as infantry regiments in Nicolas I time.

===Swedish Carabiniers===
Swedish Kungliga Skånska Karabinierregementet (&quot;Cavallerie de Scanie&quot;) were created in 1791 before the Napoleonic Wars by renaming the Skånska Kavalleriregemente and numbered eight squadrons of about 1,000 officers and troopers organised in two battalions serving in the 4th Swedish Division of the Walmoden Corps for the 1813-1814 campaign. The regiment was renamed into the Skånska Hussars by 1914.

===Westphalian Carabiniers===
The short-lived Westphalian army of 1807–14 created by Napoleon as an allied force for service with the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, included a unit of the Royal Guard designated as the &quot; Jäger Carabiniers Battalion&quot;.

===Piedmont-Savoy Carabinieri===
The Carabinieri corps was created by King Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy, with the aim of providing Piedmont with a police corps similar to the French Gendarmerie, which was both a combat regiment and a mounted military police force.

After French soldiers had occupied Turin at the end of the 18th century and later abandoned it to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Savoy, the corps of &quot;Carabinieri Reali&quot; (Royal Carabiniers) was instituted under the &quot;Regie Patenti&quot; (Royal Patents) of July 13, 1814 within the Kingdom of Sardinia Guard.

===Naples Carabiniers===

The Carabiniers of the Kingdom of Naples were a cavalry regiment formed in the early 1820s.

===South African Carabiniers===
Originating from the 1st and 2nd Royal Natal Carabiniers, the South African Carabiniers served during the Boer Wars as mounted infantry, and infantry during the First World War&#x27;s South-West Africa campaign, and later as the 1st Royal Natal Carbineers in the Second World War, notably participating with the 8th Army at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942 as part of the Commonwealth Union Defence Force contingent&#x27;s 1st South African Division and later in the Italian Campaign. The Natal Carbineers saw service in a counter-insurgency capacity in northern Namibia (South West Africa) for three months from August 1976, and thereafter in numerous modular deployments over the next decade until 1989.

===Australian Carbineers===
The Bushveldt Carbineers (BVC) were a short-lived, multinational mounted infantry regiment of the British Army, raised in South Africa during the Second Boer War.

The 320-strong regiment was formed in February 1901 and commanded by an Australian, Colonel R. W. Lenehan. It was based at Pietersburg, 180 miles north of Pretoria, and saw action in the Spelonken region of the Northern Transvaal during 1901-1902. About forty percent of the men in the BVC were Australians, and the regiment also included about forty surrendered Boers who had been recruited from the internment camps.

The unit was made infamous by the trial and execution of Harry &#x27;Breaker&#x27; Morant and Peter Handcock, who were serving members of the unit at the time of their arrest and who were charged with alleged war crimes committed while they were in the unit.

==Law enforcement carabiniers==
===Italian Carabinieri===

The Arma dei Carabinieri (literally &quot;Arm of Carabiniers&quot; or &quot;Arm of Carabineers&quot;) was formerly called the &quot;Corpo dei Carabinieri&quot; as a branch of the Italian Army, but is usually known simply as the Carabinieri performing gendarmerie role. It originates from the amalgamation of the Piedmont-Savoy and Naples Carabinieri corps after unification of Italy, and although they remained a combat cavalry regiment, they were not numbered with the &quot;Cavalleria di Linea&quot; (Cavalry of the Line) after 1871.

Both a military and a police corps, the &quot;Carabinieri&quot; have fought in every conflict in which Italy has been involved in since 1871, suffering heavy losses and being awarded many decorations for gallantry.

The &quot;Carabinieri&quot; is currently a branch of armed forces (alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force), thus ending their long standing role as the &quot;Prima Arma dell&#x27;Esercito&quot; (First Corps of the Army). It is likely that antonomasia by which the Carabinieri will continue to be referred will remain the &quot;Arma&quot;.

In recent years, &quot;Carabinieri&quot; units have been dispatched on peacekeeping missions, including Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In 2003 twelve &quot;Carabinieri&quot; were killed in a suicide bomb attack on their base in Nasiriyah, near Basra, in southern Iraq, in the largest Italian military loss of life in a single action since the Second World War (see 2003 Nasiriyah bombing).

===Spanish Carabineros under the Monarchy and Republic===

This para-military force was created in the 19th century under the Spanish monarchy, performing the role of frontier guards especially in the Pyrenees. They were distinguished by dark blue uniforms with shakos or round forage caps. Under the Spanish Republic the Carabineros were subordinated to the Finance Department of the Home Ministry, and consisted of customs and excise officials numbering some 15,000 by the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. They remained an armed force subject to military discipline. About 8,750 carabineros remained loyal to the Republican Government, providing a core of trained manpower for the Republican forces. After the war the victorious Nationalist Government disbanded the Carabineros and replaced them for frontier duties with units of the Civil Guard.

===Chilean carabineros===
Carabineros de Chile are the uniformed Chilean national military police  force The first policing organization with the name &quot;Carabiniers&quot; was the Corps of Carabiniers, in Spanish &quot;Cuerpo de Carabineros&quot;, formed in 1903 to bring law and order to the historic Araucanía region of Southern Chile. In 1908 the Carabiniers&#x27; School (&quot;Escuela de Carabineros&quot;, currently located in Providencia) was created. On April 27, 1927, President Carlos Ibáñez del Campo merged the Fiscal Police (&quot;Policía Fiscal&quot;), the Rural Police (&quot;Policia Rural&quot;), and the &quot;Cuerpo de Carabineros&quot; into the Carabiniers of Chile, one unified institution under the direction of the national government. The organization still carries the name given to it by Ibáñez, who became the Carabiniers&#x27; first Director General.

In 1973, the Carabiniers, headed by General Cesar Mendoza Duran, later appointed Director General, joined the Chilean coup of 1973 under the leadership of the Army, Navy and Air Forces leaders, that overthrew President Salvador Allende. As such, the Carabiniers&#x27; commander was a formal member of the Military Government Junta (1973–1990).

Today the Carabiniers form part of the Ministry of the Interior.

===Colombian carabineros===
National Police of Colombia has mobile units called Mobile Carabinier Squadrons or Escuadrones Móviles de Carabineros in Spanish (EMCAR). These are specialised units of the Colombian National Police, part of its Directorate of Carabineers and Rural Security (Dirección de Carabineros y Seguridad Rural) The mission of these mobile squadrons is to provide highway security, control traffic and prevent accidents. Among their objectives is to interact and socialize with civilians to create neighborhood watch and collaboration. Formed in 1846 by President Tomas Cipriano de Mosquera, they are the oldest National Police formation.

===Bolivian Carabineros===
The Bolivian National Police became institutionalized on the national level in 1937 with the creation of the National Corps of Carabineers (Cuerpo Nacional de Carabineros) and its professional training school, the Police School (Escuela de Policía), later renamed the National Police Academy (Academia Nacional de Policías). The carabineers constituted a post-Chaco War merger of the Military Police, the Gendarmerie Corps (Cuerpo de Gendarmería), the paramilitary Security Police (Policía de Seguridad), and the army&#x27;s Carabineer Regiment (Regimiento de Carabineros).

Prior to 1952 the Carabineros came under the Ministry of National Defence and were considered an extension of the Bolivian Army. Responsibility for the force subsequently was transferred to the Ministry of the Interior, although the Carabineros remain a force under military discipline and are available as a reserve for the army. Today, the 5,000-member paramilitary National Guard (Guardia Nacional), a branch of the Bolivian National Police, is still referred to as the Carabineros.

The Bolivian Carabineros are the only force having nationwide responsibility for law enforcement, including customs, traffic police and frontier guard responsibilities.

===Moldovan Carabinieri===
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moldova maintains a gendarmerie-type force affiliated with the Moldovan National Army known as the Trupele de Carabinieri, which is the Romanian language name for Carabiniers.

<text>Ranelagh ( , ; , ) is an affluent residential area and urban village on the Southside of Dublin, Ireland in the postal district of Dublin 6.

Ranelagh was originally a village called Cullenswood. It has a history of conflict, including the attack on English inhabitants in 1207 and the Battle of Rathmines in 1649. Incorporated into Dublin in the 19th century, it experienced significant development. Ranelagh Gardens, a popular entertainment venue, was established in the 1770s, and Richard Crosbie famously flew in a hot air balloon from the Gardens in 1785.

In the 1970s and 1980s, areas of Ranelagh were bought for office space development. Today, the district is part of the local electoral area of Pembroke. Ranelagh is home to several primary and secondary schools, including Scoil Bhríde, the first Irish-language school in Ireland, and Ranelagh Multi-Denominational School.

Ranelagh has been the setting for a number of literary and film works, such as Lee Dunne&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye to the Hill&quot; and John McGahern&#x27;s &quot;The Pornographer&quot;. It is also home to the Ranelagh Arts Centre and sports clubs like Ranelagh Gaels. The district is well-connected by public transport, including the Luas Green Line tram and bus routes.

==History==
The district was originally a village known as Cullenswood just outside Dublin, surrounded by landed estates. On Easter Monday in 1207, a celebrating group of English inhabitants of Dublin were attacked here by Irish raiders from county Wicklow. Three hundred people were said to have been killed. In the 1520s and 1530s Cullenswood was held by the de Meones family, who also owned, and gave their name to, nearby Meonesrath, now Rathmines.

In the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1649), the area was the scene of skirmishes culminating in the Battle of Rathmines in August 1649. After the Irish united with the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, an attempt was made to take Dublin. Their army under Ormonde was defeated, many of them killed, and the place where they fell (mainly between Rathmines and Ranelagh) was known for a long time as the Bloody Fields.

The area was incorporated into the expanding city in the 19th century, after which massive development took place. The locality became known as Ranelagh when a popular entertainment venue (now a public park) was established about 1770 and named Ranelagh Gardens after a similar venture of the same name in Chelsea, London. The Gardens were opened in 1766 by William Hollister, a London organ-builder. (The model and the name were also copied in other cities, including Liverpool, New York and Paris). The original Ranelagh Gardens in Chelsea was built on the site of Ranelagh House, the London home of the Jones family, who took their title (Earl of Ranelagh) from lands in County Wicklow that had belonged to Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne sometimes described as Lord Ranelagh, because he was head of the Gabhal Ragnaill branch of the O&#x27;Byrne clan.

In 1785, only two years after the first manned flight in history, Richard Crosbie successfully flew in a hot air balloon from Ranelagh Gardens to Clontarf. The 225th anniversary of his flight was commemorated with a balloon flight from the same gardens on 23 January 2010 although due to adverse weather the balloon did not take off.

In the 1970s and 1980s, areas of Ranelagh were bought up with the intention of developing the sites as office space, during a boom period of such construction in the wider city. One development site, purchased in 1972 by Fergus Morton, was a former builder&#x27;s yard near Athlumney Villas, a terrace of artisan houses. Morton employed Delaney McVeigh and Pike to draw up a plan for two large office blocks on the site. The site was sold with the planning permission a number of times until it was purchased by the Construction Industry Federation, who built the office blocks, completing them in 1983.

==Geography==

The name Ranelagh applies to many geographical features. The stretch of road joining Sandford Road (which begins at the corner of Anna Villa) to Ranelagh Road (which begins at the railway bridge) is known as Ranelagh or Ranelagh Village. The whole surrounding area is also popularly known as Ranelagh, stretching from Charlemont Bridge on the Grand Canal at the northern end of Ranelagh Road down to the junction with Milltown Road at the southern end of Sandford Road, and from Leeson Street to the East towards Rathmines to the West. At the centre of Ranelagh is &quot;Ranelagh Triangle&quot;, semi-officially &quot;the Angle&quot;, which is the junction of Ranelagh Village and Charleston Road at Field&#x27;s Terrace. Nearby restaurant &quot;Tribeca&quot; references these geographical features (i.e., Tri-angle Be-low Ca-nal). To the North of the Triangle is the &quot;Hill Area&quot; of Ranelagh, which was the scene of Lee Dunne&#x27;s novel, &quot;Goodbye to the Hill&quot;. Ranelagh contains many fine Victorian streets such as those surrounding Mount Pleasant Square.

The townlands of Ranelagh North and Ranelagh South are in the civil parish of St. Peter&#x27;s and in the barony of Uppercross. They are bounded on the north by Harcourt Road and Adelaide Road, on the east by Sussex Road and an old irregular boundary from there to Chelmsford Road, on the south by Chelmsford Road, Ranelagh Village, Charleston Road, Oakley Road and Dunville Avenue, and on the west by Beechwood Park, Belgrave Square East, Mountpleasant Avenue Upper, Bessborough Parade, Rathmines Road Lower and Richmond Street South. The area, popularly known today as Ranelagh, also includes parts of the adjoining townlands of Cullenswood, Sallymount and Milltown.

==Electoral area==
Ranelagh is in the local electoral area of Pembroke since 2019. From 2014 to 2019 it was in the Rathgar–Rathmines LEA and prior to that in Pembroke–Rathmines. It is located in the Dáil constituency of Dublin Bay South with effect from the 2016 general election, formerly Dublin South-East.

It was part of the urban district of Rathmines and Rathgar, which was abolished in 1930.

==Education==
There are several primary and secondary schools in the area. Scoil Bhríde, founded in 1917, was the first gaelscoil (Irish-language school) in Ireland. Lios na nÓg, another gaelscoil, is located in Cullenswood House on Oakley Road, where St. Enda&#x27;s School (Scoil Éanna) was set up by Patrick Pearse in 1908. This was the first school in Ireland where pupils were taught in both Irish and English. St. Enda&#x27;s school then moved to Rathfarnham in 1912 leaving the school building, Cullenswood House, unoccupied. In 1998, Lios na nÓg moved in and the school went under a major refurbishment over the period 2008-&#x27;09.

The Ranelagh Multi-Denominational School is another primary school, established in September 1988, and located on the main Ranelagh Road, close to the Luas stop. It is on the site of the old St. Columba&#x27;s national school, which was donated to RMDSA, the school&#x27;s promoting body, by the Church of Ireland. The school won many awards for the architecture of the building, built in the late 1990s.

Other primary schools in the area include Sandford National School, located close to Gonzaga College. Secondary schools include Gonzaga College for boys and Sandford Park School.
==Culture==
Lee Dunne&#x27;s novel &quot;Goodbye to the Hill&quot; is set in Ranelagh.

The cover picture of John McGahern&#x27;s &quot;The Pornographer&quot; is of Mount Pleasant Square.

In March 2013, Lenny Abrahamson, Irish film and television director, filmed part of his movie &quot;Frank&quot; on Cowper Gardens and Park Drive of Ranelagh.

The 1965 movie &quot;Young Cassidy&quot;, starring Maggie Smith and Rod Taylor, was filmed in parts of Ranelagh.

Ranelagh Arts Centre is located on Ranelagh Main Street, across the road from the Luas Station. The centre presents exhibitions by artists from the locality and beyond with regular open calls. As part of the Ranelagh Arts Festival 2021, short films were screened in the Stella Movie Theatre in the Ranelagh hotel, The Devlin Hotel.

==Sport==
Ranelagh Gaels GAA was founded in 2003. The club&#x27;s Ladies&#x27; Gaelic football team won the Dublin Junior E Championship in 2010 and added the Junior D title in 2019. The men&#x27;s Gaelic football team won the Dublin Junior 2 Championship at Parnell Park in 2018. The hurling team lines out in the Dublin Junior H Championship. An underage section was started in 2012.

==Transport==

The Luas Green Line has two stops in the Ranelagh area: &quot;Ranelagh&quot; (on Ranelagh Road) and &quot;Beechwood&quot; (on Dunville Avenue), built on the site of the former &quot;Rathmines and Ranelagh railway station&quot; on the Harcourt Street railway line (the station opened on 16 July 1896, and finally closed on 1 January 1959).

The Dublin Bus 11, 44, 44d, and S2 routes pass through Ranelagh.

Initial plans for the Dublin Metro (later Metrolink) included a proposed upgrade of Ranelagh Luas stop to a metro station. However, as a result of the portal of the tunnel being moved south, to just north of Beechwood, these plans were updated such that the Metro would instead stop at Beechwood and Charlemont Luas stop, just north of Ranelagh. Beechwood would become the southernmost Luas stop, with the line further south being served only by the Metro.

<text>George Cadogan Gardner McKay (June 10, 1932 – November 21, 2001) was an American actor, artist, and author. He is best known for the lead role in the TV series &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, based loosely on the writings of James Michener. His character, Adam Troy, is a Korean War veteran who purchased the two-masted 82-foot (25 m) schooner &quot;Tiki III&quot;, and sailed the South Pacific. The show ran for three seasons on ABC from 1959–1962, for a total of 91 episodes.

==Early life==
Born in New York City, McKay was the son of ad executive Hugh Deane McKay (born 1894) and socialite Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Gardner McKay (born 1904). He was the great-grandson of shipbuilder Donald McKay. The father&#x27;s business took the family to Paris, where McKay attended private schools. The family returned to the United States shortly before the outbreak of World War II; McKay and his older brother, Hugh, lived with grandparents in Lexington, Kentucky. McKay later said that he fell in love with Kentucky and considered it paradise.

He attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York for two years, where he majored in art. He wrote for &quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot; and the campus magazine. He dropped out of school at the age of 19 following the death of his father and moved to Greenwich Village where he worked as a sculptor and writer. McKay also took up photography and saw some of his work published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

McKay&#x27;s sculpting appeared in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and at an exhibit of his work McKay attracted the attention of photographer Richard Avedon. Avedon invited McKay to Paris to shoot a series of photographs with model Suzy Parker, which led to a modeling career. &quot;Town and Country&quot; magazine did a piece on McKay and his sculptures in its Man About Town section, which led to an offer from an agent.

== Career==
McKay impressed Dore Schary, who signed him to a contract with MGM. For that studio he appeared in episodes of &quot;The Thin Man&quot; and appeared in the film &quot;Raintree County&quot;, with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift. The movie was partly filmed in Kentucky.

McKay left MGM and had television guest roles on &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, and &quot;Jefferson Drum&quot;.

In 1957–1958, McKay played United States Army Lieutenant Dan Kelly in the 38-episode syndicated western series &quot;Boots and Saddles&quot;, with co-stars Jack Pickard and Patrick McVey.

McKay screen-tested at 20th Century Fox for a TV series based on &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;, but failed to get the role. The test did, however, net him a long-term contract at the studio.
Dominick Dunne was searching for an actor to star in his planned &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; when he spotted McKay at the studio coffee shop. Dunne later said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know who he was. He was an extraordinarily handsome guy. I said, &#x27;Are you an actor?&#x27; I gave him my card and said, &#x27;If you&#x27;re interested, call me.&#x27;&quot; McKay called, and ten actors were tested for the role. Dunne said of McKay: &quot;His (test) was the worst, but everybody reacted to him, I mean everybody – especially the women.&quot;

Although previously unknown to the public, McKay was featured on the cover of the July 6, 1959 issue of &quot;Life&quot; just two months before the series premiered. The article noted that he had been around boats since childhood and was an experienced seaman.

During the series&#x27; run, McKay had small roles in several Fox films, including &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Right Approach&quot; (1961).

McKay returned to Hollywood in 1963, and had a supporting role in Fox&#x27;s &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; (1964).

McKay&#x27;s final film was the 1968 &quot;I Sailed to Tahiti with an All Girl Crew&quot;, written and directed by Richard L. Bare.

&quot;It took me 100 hours to become a good actor,&quot; said McKay. &quot;Then I committed professional suicide.&quot;

McKay had just decided to end his acting career, when he got a phone call from the noted director George Cukor, offering him the opportunity to star in a romantic comedy film opposite Marilyn Monroe. The film was &quot;Something&#x27;s Got to Give&quot;. McKay had made up his mind and turned it down. Cukor and Monroe were shocked. Monroe phoned him to see if she could get him to change his mind. McKay said, &quot;She was so delightful on the phone, so winning, so seductive in a way,&quot; but he said no. He added &quot;I didn’t belong in acting.&quot; The part went to Dean Martin and the film was never completed. Instead McKay went sailing in the Caribbean and South America for a year and a half. &quot;Not doing anything really,&quot; he said later. &quot;I didn&#x27;t give myself an excuse for being there.&quot; He moved to Paris, where he had lived as a boy.

McKay left Hollywood to pursue his interest in photography, sculpture, and writing. He exhibited his sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, besides holding individual exhibitions. His lifeboat rescue photographs of the &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; were published internationally.

McKay wrote many plays and novels, and was a literary critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; between 1977 and 1982. He taught writing classes at the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Southern California, the University of Alaska, and the University of Hawaii.

He wrote and co-directed a TV film, &quot;Me&quot; (1973), for Hollywood Television Theatre on PBS. He wrote a script for another TV movie, &quot;Sea Marks&quot; (1976), based on his play.

&quot;I&#x27;m through with acting,&quot; he said in 1976. &quot;I&#x27;ll never do a series again. I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a mental mess-up for me. I got all sorts of attention I didn&#x27;t deserve and I was too sensitive to hear things about myself. People loved me and hated me for absolutely no good reasons.&quot;

His play &quot;Toyer&quot; was produced by the Arena Players Repertory Theater in New York in 1993. &quot;Toyer&quot; was produced in London at the Arts Theatre in 2009.

His play &quot;Sea Marks&quot; was produced in New York in 1981 at the Players Theatre; in 2003 at the American Theatre for Actors (Off-Off Broadway), directed by Allen Fitzpatrick and produced by Jonah Productions; and again in 2014, produced Off-Broadway at the Irish Repertory Theatre.

A verse by McKay became the lyrics for the song &quot;Black Bean Soup&quot; sung by the actor and singer David Soul. It was the B-side of the hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Us&quot;. Soul sang it as a duet with actress Lynne Marta. It has sold 1.16 million copies in the UK. It is also part of the soundtrack on two episodes of Soul&#x27;s TV series &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;. He also has two other co-writing credits on Soul&#x27;s eponymous debut album, &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Topanga&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gardner bought a wooded property in Beverly Hills and kept a menagerie of animals including lions, cheetahs, dogs, and a monkey which he brought back from his sojourn to South America.

==Awards==
McKay&#x27;s awards included three National Endowment for the Arts fellowships for playwriting, the Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Play, and the Sidney Carrington Prize. He was a winner in the Canadian Regional Drama Festival, and runner-up in the Hemingway Short Story Contest.

==Final years and death==
McKay settled in Hawaii, where he died from prostate cancer in 2001 at the age of 69. He was survived by his wife Madeleine Madigan, a painter, and two children. McKay is buried in Hebron Cemetery, Brooks, Bullitt Co.,Kentucky. Memorial ID 6001210 Find-a-Grave

<doc id="944685" wikidata="Q729469" url="?curid=944685" title="Old South">
<text>Geographically, the U.S. states known as the Old South are those in the Southern United States that were among the original Thirteen Colonies. The region term is differentiated from the Deep South and Upper South. 

From a cultural and social standpoint, the &quot;Old South&quot; is used to describe the rural, agriculturally-based, slavery-reliant economy and society in the Antebellum South, prior to the American Civil War (1861–65), in contrast to the &quot;New South&quot; of the post-Reconstruction Era.

==Culture==
The social structure of the Old South was made an important research topic for scholars by Ulrich Bonnell Phillips in the early 20th century. The romanticized image of the &quot;Old South&quot; tells of slavery&#x27;s plantations, as famously typified in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, a blockbuster 1936 novel and its adaptation in a 1939 Hollywood film, along with the animated Disney film, &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). 

Historians in recent decades have paid much more attention to the enslaved people of the South and the world they made for themselves. To a lesser extent, they have also studied the poor subsistence farmers, known as &quot;yeoman farmers&quot;, who owned little property and no slaves.

==Politics==
The Old South had a vigorous two-party system, with the Whigs being the strongest in towns, in the business community, and in upscale plantation areas. The slightly more numerous Democrats were strongest among common farmers and poor western districts. After the end of Reconstruction in 1877, black Republicans were largely disenfranchised, leaving the Republican Party a small element based mainly in remote mountain districts within the South. The region was now called &quot;the Solid South&quot;, where Southern states would mainly vote Democrat, and lasted through the 1964 presidential election.

==Religion==
Historians have explored the religiosity of the Old South in some detail. Before the American Revolution, the Church of England was established in some areas, especially Virginia and South Carolina. However, the colonists refused to allow any Anglican bishops, and instead established a practicing layman as head of the vestry in each Anglican church, which then allowed for policy determinations as if the parish were a unit of local government. Thus it handled community issues such as welfare, cemeteries, and local infrastructure.

The Church of England was disestablished during the American Revolution under the leadership of people such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. The 18th century had the First Great Awakening, while the early 19th century saw the Second Great Awakening make a powerful influence across the region, especially with poor whites but also with black slaves. The result was the establishment of many Methodist and Baptist churches. In the antebellum period, large numbers of open air revivals converted new members and strengthened the resolve of established members. By contrast in the North, revivals sparked a strong interest in abolition of slavery, a forbidden topic South of the Mason-Dixon line. Additionally during the antebellum period, social issues such as public schools and prohibition, which grew rapidly in the North, made little headway in the South. Most Southern church members used their religion for intense group solidarity, which often involved intimate examinations of the sins and failures of their fellow parishioners. At a deeper level, religion served as a temporary relief, with a promised permanent relief from all the hardships and oppressions of this world. Missionary activity was a controversial issue in the South, with strong support for missionaries mostly among the Methodists, while the Baptists vacillated between movements for and against missionary activity.

==Honor==
Historian Bertram Wyatt-Brown has emphasized how a very strong sense of honor, rooted in European traditions, shaped ethical behavior for men in the Old South. The rigid unwritten code guided family and gender relationships and helped provide a structure for social control. A highly controversial aspect of the honor system was the necessity to fight in duels, under rigidly prescribed conditions, whenever a man&#x27;s honor was challenged by an equal. If one&#x27;s honor was challenged by an inferior person, it sufficed to beat him up. Men had the duty of protecting the honor of their women as well. Honor became an important ingredient in differentiating manhood versus effeminacy and patriarchy versus companionate marriage. College authorities strictly forbade violent duels. In response, undergraduates revised the code, dropping the duels, and set up a system whereby fellow students would dictate punishment when misconduct violated college rules or the code of honor. By claiming such control over their college environment, students reshaped the honor code and bridged the awkward gap between dependence and independent adulthood. So many talented people were being killed that anti-dueling associations were organized which challenged the honor code.

==Old South Day==
Since 1976, the city of Ochlocknee, Georgia has celebrated &#x27;Old South Day&#x27; in November each year.

<doc id="944694" wikidata="Q987748" url="?curid=944694" title="Malahide">
<text>Malahide ( ; ) is an affluent coastal settlement in Fingal, County Dublin, Ireland, situated north of Dublin city. It has a village centre surrounded by suburban housing estates, with a population of 18,608 as per the 2022 census.

Malahide Castle dates from the 12th century and is surrounded by a large park, part of which incorporates an international cricket ground. The area also features a sandy beach, a marina, a parkrun and a variety of sporting clubs.

==Etymology==
The modern name Malahide comes from &quot;Mullach Íde&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;the hill of Íde&quot; or &quot;Íde&#x27;s sand-hill&quot;; it could also mean &quot;Sand-hills of the Hydes&quot; (from Mullac h-Íde), in turn probably referring to a Norman family from the Donabate area. According to the Placenames Database of Ireland the name Malahide is possibly derived from the Irish &quot;Baile Átha Thíd&quot; meaning &quot;the town of the ford of Thíd&quot;, which may have been a ford at the mouth of the Gaybrook Stream, on the road to Swords. Malahide Bay was anciently called &quot;Inber Domnann&quot;, the &quot;river-mouth of the Fir Domnann&quot;.

==Location and access==

Malahide is situated north of the city of Dublin, lying between Swords, Kinsealy and Portmarnock. It is situated on the southern shore of an estuary where the Broadmeadow River comes to the sea; on the opposite side of the estuary is Kilcrea, and, some way inland, Donabate. To the west of the village, the Gay Brook or Gaybrook Stream passes through Yellow Walls, once a small separate village, to reach the estuary in a marshy area.

The village is served by the DART and some mainline rail services, run by Irish Rail. The Dublin Bus 32, 42 and 102, the 32X and 142 peak hour express services, and the 42N Nite-Link route serve the town from Dublin City Centre. Route 102 serves local areas to/from Dublin Airport (via Swords) and Sutton Station (via Portmarnock).

Malahide is close to the M1 motorway. To travel to Malahide by car, one would exit the M1 at Junction 4, travel along the R132 Swords Bypass, and then finally onto the R106 and into Malahide.

==History==

While there are some remnants of prehistoric activity, Malahide is known to have become a persistent settlement from the coming of the Vikings, who landed in 795 and used Malahide Estuary (along with Baldoyle Bay, where they had a &quot;longphort&quot;) as a convenient base. With the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, the last Danish King of Dublin retired to the area in 1170.

Malahide Castle, which dominates the area, was constructed after Henry II granted an extensive area of land north of Dublin to Sir Richard Talbot in 1176. The castle evolved from this, and remained in the hands of the Talbot family until 1976, aside from a short period where it was seized by Oliver Cromwell. 

There is an ancient covered well, St. Sylvester&#x27;s, on the old main street (Old Street, previously Chapel Street), which used to have a &quot;pattern&quot; to &quot;Our Lady&quot; each 15 August.

In 1475 Thomas Talbot, head of the Talbot family of Malahide Castle, was granted the title &quot;Admiral of the port of Malahide&quot; by King Edward IV, with power to hold admiralty courts and levy customs duties on all merchandise coming into the port. The office was hereditary, and the family&#x27;s right to act as Admiral was confirmed by the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1639.

By the early 19th century, the village had a population of over 1000, and a number of local industries, including salt harvesting, while the harbour continued in commercial operation, with landings of coal and construction materials. By 1831, the population had reached 1223. The area grew in popularity in Georgian times as a seaside resort for wealthy Dublin city dwellers. This is still evident today from the fine collection of Georgian houses in the town and along the seafront, and Malahide is still a popular spot for day-trippers, especially in the summer months.

In the 1960s, developers began to build housing estates around the village core of Malahide, launching the first, &quot;Ard na Mara&quot;, in 1964. Further estates followed, to the northwest, south and west, but the village core remained intact, with the addition of a &quot;marina apartment complex&quot; development, adjacent to the coastal village green.

There are many shops and service outlets in the village core, including a small shopping centre, a supermarket, fashion boutiques, hair and beauty salons, florists, art galleries, book shops, food outlets, and a service station. There are multiple pubs (including Gibney&#x27;s, Fowler&#x27;s, Duffy&#x27;s and Gilbert and Wright&#x27;s), cafés and restaurants, and there is also the historic 203-room &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. Malahide has the highest median household income of any large census town in Ireland, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

==Governance==
Malahide is part of the three-seat Dáil constituency of Dublin Fingal East.

For elections to Fingal County Council, Malahide forms part of the seven-seat local electoral area of Howth–Malahide.

Malahide is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock within the traditional County Dublin.

==Leisure and organisations==
Near to the village itself is a regional park formed from Malahide Castle and its demesne, including gardens. This was once the estate of the Baron Talbot of Malahide family. Aside from Malahide Castle Demesne, there are a number of smaller parks (with further spaces planned, for example, at &quot;Robswall&quot; and &quot;Seamount&quot;). There are several golf courses nearby, and GAA, soccer, tennis, rugby, yacht clubs and Sea Scouts. Malahide also has a substantial marina.

The Malahide area has more than twenty residents&#x27; associations, sixteen of which, as of May 2007, worked together through the Malahide Community Forum, which publishes a quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Malahide Guardian&quot;.

There is a Lions club, a camera club, a musical and drama society, the Enchiriadis choirs, a chess club and a photography group which has published calendars. The Malahide Pipe Band was established in 1954 and still practices in the same area, in Yellow Walls, today. The band comprises pipers and drummers playing the bagpipes and snare, tenor and bass drums, and plays at various events locally, and in competitions around the country in the summer months. The band has also been involved in running a Pipe Band Competition on the grounds of Malahide Castle for a number of years.

In 1990, Malahide won the Irish Tidy Towns Competition.

===Historical society and museum===
Malahide Historical Society collects materials of local and general historical interest, arranges talks, and operates a museum on the grounds of Malahide Castle. The museum first opened in the cottage at the main vehicular entrance to Malahide Demesne, in 1988. It moved to the Craft Courtyard in 2007 but closed in 2012, with the collection being stored. It reopened in a new format in some rooms in the Steward&#x27;s House, by the coach parking, and offers free access.

===Malahide Sea Scouts===
Malahide Sea Scouts (9th Port of Dublin) was founded in 1919 and has 635 members making it the largest Scout Group in Ireland and largest Scout Group in Europe. Malahide Sea Scouts offers a Sea Scouting programme to boys and girls of 6 to 26 years of age from the Scout Den on James&#x27;s Terrace, and Sea Scouts can be seen sailing, rowing, paddling, swimming and powerboating. It has had several notable members including; Adam Clayton, Dave Evans (Edge), Richard (Dik) Evans, John Kilraine, Mark Little, Philip Quinn, Richard Burrows, Scott Flanigan, Eamon Falvey, Karl Deeter, Kevin Dundon, Philip Walton. In 2019, Malahide Sea Scouts celebrated its centenary.

==Sport==
There are also a wide variety of sports clubs within the Malahide area. Rugby, soccer, GAA sports, sailing, hockey, golf, cricket, tennis and basketball are all well represented.

===Rugby===
Malahide Rugby Club is located in a modern clubhouse and sports ground opposite the scenic Malahide estuary on Estuary Road. Founded in 1922, Malahide Rugby Club had to disband during World War II due to a lack of available players. However, in 1978 the club was reformed. It now fields three senior men&#x27;s teams, one women&#x27;s team, four youth teams and six &quot;mini&quot; rugby teams.

===Soccer===
Malahide United AFC was founded in 1944 and currently fields 60 schoolboy/girl teams, from Under 7 to Under 18, and 4 senior teams. They have an academy catering for 5-, 6- and 7-year-olds. With over 1,000 registered players, Malahide United is one of the largest clubs in Ireland. The home ground is Gannon Park, which comprises two 11-a-side pitches, one 7-a-side pitch, one 11-a-side floodlit all-weather pitch, one floodlit 5-a-side/warm-up all-weather pitch and full clubhouse facilities. Further pitches are used in Malahide Castle (two 7/9-a-sides and three 11-a-sides) with a further 11-a-side pitch in Broomfield, Malahide.

===Tennis===
There are two tennis clubs in the area: Malahide Lawn Tennis &amp; Croquet Club, founded in 1879, is one of the oldest tennis clubs in Ireland. The club is situated in the centre of Malahide village, overlooking the outer Broadmeadow estuary. Grove Lawn Tennis Club is a grass court tennis club.

===Gaelic games===
St Sylvesters is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club. The club was founded in 1903 and last won the Dublin Men&#x27;s Senior Football Championship in 1996. The club plays hurling, camogie and Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Gaelic football. In 1996, they became the only Fingal to win the Dublin Senior Football championship when under former Galway midfielder, Brian Talty, they defeated Erins Isle in the final.

===Golf===
Malahide Golf Club opened in 1892, moving to a new location in 1990. It has a 2-storey clubhouse completed in May 1990, with 1,000 square metres (10,000 sq. ft.), including bars, a restaurant, a conference room and a snooker room. The 17th is a notoriously difficult hole known to locals as &quot;Cromwell&#x27;s Delight&quot;, due to its narrow fairways and dominant bunkers.

===Sailing===
There are two sailing clubs situated on the estuary; Swords Sailing &amp; Boating Club and Malahide Yacht Club. 
The inner, Broadmeadow estuary is often considered as Irelands &#x27;premier&#x27; dinghy sailing location with its sheltered and non-tidal waters making it an extensively accessible home to many sailing Olympians. While sailing in Malahide has been enjoyed and competed in for hundreds of years, Malahide Yacht Club as it is known today was established in the 1950s. With an award-winning and state-of-the-art facilities, Malahide Yacht Club is the only sailing club in the British Isles that operates out of two permanent club house under two distinctive bodies of water. The sheltered &#x27;Upper&#x27; non-tidal estuary for dinghy performance, and the coastal tidal &#x27;Lower&#x27; Estuary for keelboat activity and cruising.

===Hockey===
Malahide Fingal Hockey Club was formed from the amalgamation of Malahide Hockey Club and Fingal Hockey Club (formerly Aer Lingus). An all-female club, they currently field four senior teams and have a junior section of nine teams aged between 7 and 16. All teams for play and train in Broomfield Malahide.

===Cricket===
Malahide Cricket Club was founded in 1861 and the ground is situated within Malahide Castle demesne, near the railway station. The ground has hosted Test cricket and One Day Internationals.

===Basketball===
Malahide Basketball Club was formed in 1977, and as of 2024, fields 2 senior ladies&#x27; teams, 4 senior men&#x27;s teams and 18 junior girls and boys teams (from under 10 to under 20). They train and play their home matches at Malahide Community School and Holywell Community Centre.

==Education==
There are five schools in the environs of Malahide, four primaries (Pope John Paul II National School, St. Andrews National School, St. Oliver Plunkett Primary School, and St. Sylvester&#x27;s Infant School) and one secondary (Pobal Scoil Iosa, Malahide).

==Religion==

Malahide has two Catholic parishes, St. Sylvester&#x27;s and Yellow Walls, and one Church of Ireland parish (St. Andrews), and also forms part of a Presbyterian community, with a church built in 1956 as the first Presbyterian church in the Republic of Ireland since 1922 (it is one of two churches of the Congregation of Howth and Malahide).

==Transport==

===Trains===
Malahide railway station opened on 25 May 1844. It is now one of the northern termini of the DART system, (the other being Howth). The station features a heritage garden and a decorative ironwork canopy, which contains the monogram of the Great Northern Railway (&#x27;GNR&#x27;), who operated the route prior to the nationalisation of the railways.

The railway crosses the Broadmeadow estuary on the Broadmeadow viaduct, known locally as &quot;The Arches&quot;. The original viaduct was a wooden structure built in 1844, which was replaced with an iron structure in 1860 and a pre-cast structure in 1966–7.

====Viaduct collapse====

On 21 August 2009, the 18:07 train from Balbriggan to Connolly was passing over the 200-year-old viaduct when the driver noticed subsidence and the embankment giving way on the northbound track. The train passed over the bridge before it collapsed and the driver alerted authorities. An inquiry was to investigate the possibility that seabed erosion was the primary cause of the collapse. 
A member of Malahide Sea Scouts, Ivan Barrett, had contacted Iarnród Éireann five days before the collapse about possible damage to the viaduct and a change in water flow around it.

The championships brought together the European Championships in swimming (long course), open water swimming, diving and synchronised swimming.

<text>David Raphael Moscow (born November 14, 1974) is an American actor, producer and activist. He is best known for his role as young Josh Baskin in the 1988 film &quot;Big&quot; and as David Jacobs in the 1992 musical film &quot;Newsies.&quot;

==Career==

In 1988, Moscow played young Josh Baskin in &quot;Big&quot;, in which his character was magically transformed into an adult played by Tom Hanks. Moscow next played the role of David Jacobs in the 1992 musical film &quot;Newsies&quot;, co-starring opposite Christian Bale. Moscow also appeared in a leading role opposite Jessica Alba in the film &quot;Honey&quot; and starred on several network television series including &quot;Zoe, Duncan, Jack &amp; Jane&quot;. He also featured on the television series &quot;Seinfeld&quot; as the character Lomez Jr in the episode &quot;The Van Buren Boys&quot;.

Moscow has appeared in leading roles on Broadway, including the role of Artie in the production &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong with This Picture&quot; at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre. He co-developed and co-produced Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x27;s first production of &quot;In the Heights&quot; with his ex-fiance, actress Kerry Washington. As a producer, his 2012 project, &quot;Hellbenders&quot;, was acquired by Lionsgate for North American and foreign distribution; and his film, the psychological thriller &quot;Desolation&quot;, was his directorial debut and was partially funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign. &quot;Desolation&quot; was screened and honored at film festivals around the world including the Wroclaw Festival in Poland. Recent producing projects include &quot;Sylvio&quot;, &quot;The Jingoist&quot;, &quot;Blind&quot;, &quot;Easy Living&quot; and &quot;Thirst Street&quot;. He launched a Kickstarter campaign to help fund post-production with a video reenactment of the Zoltar &quot;wish&quot; scene from &quot;Big&quot;. The campaign raised more than $70,000.

With his father Jon, Moscow created &quot;From Scratch&quot;, a food show in which he travels to source all the ingredients to cook a recipe. The first two seasons screened on the History and FYI channels, the third and fourth on Tastemade, with the fifth season set to air on &quot;Tastemade&quot; in April 2025. In 2022, they published a book based on the series, called &quot;From Scratch: Adventures in Harvesting, Hunting, Fishing, and Foraging on a Fragile Planet,&quot; which became a gold winner in the 2023 Nautilus Book Awards. Kirkus Reviews praised it as &quot;Unadulterated, smart, beautifully rendered, and often thrilling... This is delicious, adventuresome entertainment for the mind, soul, heart, and stomach.&quot;

Moscow has a long history as an activist, which began in 1992 after he dropped out of college to track wolves for the Round River Conservations Studies. He built a mixed-income green housing facility in Harlem in 2006. In 2007, the magazine &quot;Time Out New York&quot; reported Moscow&#x27;s involvement in developing sustainable and economic housing in Harlem.

==Personal life==
Moscow was born in the Bronx, the son of Patricia (née Sterner) and Jon Moscow. His mother&#x27;s family is from Montana. His father is Jewish, and his mother is Mormon, but he was not raised in either religion. He attended Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in the 1990s.
Moscow is married to Karen Moscow. Moscow was engaged to actress Kerry Washington from October 2004 to March 2007.

<text>Administrative resource is the ability of political candidates (and parties) to use their official positions or connections to government institutions to influence the outcome of elections.

The term is widely used in Russia and other former USSR countries, because the practice is widespread, is well known and is openly discussed by public and media. In these countries, the administrative resource is one of the major factors in most elections. Although similar practices of corruption are conducted throughout the world in countries with fragile democracies, the term administrative resource is ascribed almost exclusively to Russia. Moreover, the utilization of administrative resources is generally not considered to be a democratic form of electioneering but in fact as a tool used to undermine democracy.

The administrative resource is only one part that determines the election outcome. Two other major factors are the ideology (candidate&#x27;s agenda) and the use of political technologies (PR, campaign organisation, etc.).

Among many different ways the administrative resource can be applied are:
* Mobilisation of organisational and financial resources. The authorities can easily pressure businessmen to fund preferred candidates and parties. Before Russian parliamentary elections the money is often used to create &quot;authorities parties&quot;, based not on a particular ideology but on affiliation with the government and easy access to money.
* The laws can be selectively applied to assist friendly candidates, by hindering their competition. The authorities can use frequent tax inspections, police searches and arrests to punish businessmen who fund the competing candidates.
* The authorities can use the election laws to their advantage, for example, by creating a pretext for appealing the results later if the unfavourable candidate is winning. Another option is to stop from voting some groups of people who are likely to vote against the preferred candidate.
* Government controlled organisations, such as the army, prisons, hospitals, public schools, etc. can be mobilised for signature collection and other goals. They can also pressure their employees and customers for voting for particular candidates and exercise control over votes by housing the polling stations.
* Redistribution of budget funds. The authorities can bribe the electorate indirectly by repaying pension debts, indexing salaries, etc. The federal government can control governors by measuring donations to their regions.
* Controlling the mass media. The heads of states or regions can easily create news topics for media, getting free publicity and circumventing the limits for TV advertisements imposed on all candidates. This method was used with particular effectiveness in 2004 Russian presidential election.
* Falsifying the election results. Additional ballots can be introduced under the names of those who didn&#x27;t vote, ballots for &quot;wrong&quot; candidate can be invalidated by damaging them, ballots can be replaced. The authorities can also control the staff of the election committees and prevent control by independent observers.

<text>Thomas Larkin Malloy (September 24, 1954 – September 29, 2016) was an American soap opera actor, voice-over artist and acting teacher.

== Early life ==
Malloy was born in New York City, the third child of John and Theresa (née Larkin) Malloy, both Irish immigrants. He had one older brother, Patrick Malloy, and one older sister, Maureen Malloy.

== Career ==
Malloy began his acting career in 1974 while he attended Iona College and acted in Off-Off-Broadway plays.

His first major television role was wealthy playboy Schuyler Whitney (and his impostor) on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from 1980 to 1984. Malloy next played businessman Kyle Sampson opposite Kim Zimmer on the CBS soap &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1984 to 1987.

While on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, Malloy was hit by a car on Park Avenue in New York City. He was temporarily replaced by James Horan, who Malloy would later replace as Clay Alden on &quot;Loving&quot; in 1992.

In later years, Larkin worked as a voice-over artist and acting teacher.

== Personal life ==
Malloy died on September 29, 2016, in New York City, from complications of a heart attack he suffered on his 62nd birthday.

<doc id="944758" wikidata="Q1550938" url="?curid=944758" title="Monocentridae">
<text>Pinecone fishes are small and unusual marine fish of the family Monocentridae. The family contains just four species in two genera, one of which is monotypic. Their distribution is limited to tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific. Pinecone fishes are popular subjects of public aquaria, but are both expensive and considered a challenge for the hobbyist to maintain.

== Description ==
These fish are aptly named; their rounded, compressed bodies are completely covered (with the exception of the caudal peduncle) with very large, strong, platelike scales called scutes, which are fortified with prominent ridges. The first dorsal fin is composed of four to seven strong, disunited spines which vary in length; the second dorsal fin and anal fin are small, spineless and rounded, situated far back of the convex head. The pectoral fins are somewhat elongate and the caudal fin is truncate.

Coloration is typically a yellow to orange, with the scales dramatically outlined in black. The eyes are relatively large, and the mouth is oblique and subterminal. On either side of the lower jaw is a bioluminescent organ called a photophore: a pale light is produced by symbiotic bacteria within the organ, and the color of the light varies with ambient light levels—orange by day and blue-green at night.

The pineapplefish, &quot;Cleidopus gloriamaris&quot;, is the largest species, reaching up to in length. Sexual dimorphism is not apparent.

== Life history ==
Pinecone fishes inhabit the sublittoral zone, and are associated with ledges and caves, rocky and (occasionally) coral reefs over a hard bottom. Found at 10–200 m deep (with juveniles frequenting the shallower end of this range), pinecone fishes are nocturnal and form schools.

The photophores are thought to play a role in attracting the zooplankton upon which the fish feed; intraspecific communication may also be a use for the light. Little is known of their reproductive biology, but they are assumed not to guard their brood.

<doc id="944769" wikidata="Q1951898" url="?curid=944769" title="Muhammad bin Ladin">
<text>Muhammad bin Ladin (; – 3 September 1967) was a Yemeni-born Saudi billionaire business magnate working primarily in the construction industry. He founded what is today the Saudi Binladin Group and became the wealthiest non-royal Saudi, establishing the wealth and prestige of the bin Ladin family. He is the father of Osama bin Laden, who is known for planning the September 11 attacks.

== Life ==
Muhammad bin Ladin was born on the Hadramawt coast of south Yemen to Awad, a Kindite Hadrami tribesman from al-Rubat, a village in Wadi Doan. His year of birth is often given as 1908, although this is an approximation at best, as no central government had solidified control over the area at the time and no birth registry existed. Muhammad&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Abud, the son of Ali, one of four brothers (the others being Ahmad, Mansur, and Zayd) from whom the four Banu Laden clans trace their ancestry.

Poor and uneducated, his family emigrated to Tihamah before World War I. According to Eric Margolis, he initially worked as a porter in Jeddah, like many other impoverished Yemenite emigrants of that time. However, Salon.com reports that his first job was as a bricklayer with Aramco. In 1931, he started his own construction business and after coming to the attention of Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, the first monarch of Saudi Arabia, he eventually achieved such success that his family became known as &quot;the wealthiest non-royal family in the kingdom.&quot;

Muhammad bin Ladin strategically built strong ties with the Saudi royal family by actively participating in King Abdel Aziz&#x27;s public meetings. Recognizing the aging king&#x27;s mobility challenges, Muhammad took the initiative to construct a ramp at the palace in Jeddah, allowing the monarch to easily move between the floors in his car.

Muhammad&#x27;s remarkable financial success was ascribed to a shrewd business sense, fealty to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s rulers, reliability, and a willingness to offer the lowest bid on construction contracts. By undercutting local construction firms, he had become a multi-millionaire by the 1940s. He cultivated a sizable workforce involved in projects across Saudi Arabia. In 1948, Muhammad scored a major breakthrough by securing a commission to build a palace for the future King Saud. In the early 1950s, when a British company withdrew from a contract to construct a crucial road from Jeddah to Medina, Muhammad stepped in to fill the void, solidifying his role as a key player in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s construction landscape.

As the &quot;royal builder,&quot; Muhammad bin Ladin maintained close relationships with the royal family, particularly Prince Faisal of Saudi Arabia. In 1964, Prince Faisal deposed his half-brother, King Saud, and began rebuilding the kingdom after the wasteful excesses of the Saud era. King Faisal accepted Muhammad bin Ladin&#x27;s offer of financial assistance to support the national economy and as a reward, King Faisal issued a royal decree awarding all future construction projects to Muhammad bin Ladin&#x27;s construction company. As a result, bin Laden&#x27;s company eventually amassed assets in excess of US$5 billion.
He made his initial fortune from exclusive rights to all mosque and other religious building construction in Saudi Arabia and several other Arab countries. Until 1967, Muhammad bin Ladin held exclusive responsibility for restorations at the Jami Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem.

Despite his royal associations and great wealth, Muhammad bin Ladin lived a relatively simple and devout life, demanding that his children observe a strict religious and moral code. In his later years, the bin Laden corporate network diversified its activities beyond construction, largely in foreign investment and oil.

== Religion ==

He was reportedly raised as a Wahhabi Muslim, noted for his religious devotion and boasted that he could fly by private helicopter to pray at Mecca, Medina and al-Aqsa (in Jerusalem) in the same day.

== Wives and children ==

He fathered a total of 52 children by 22 wives. He had three wives who mostly remained the same, but would divorce and frequently change his fourth wife. This practice kept within the bounds of Islamic guidance of polygyny, which permits men to have up to four wives at one time.

His widely-known son is the founder of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Ladin (), although the two seldom saw each other and only once had a one-on-one meeting together. Osama&#x27;s mother, Hamida al-Attas, () was born and raised in Syria before marrying Muhammad bin Ladin and moving to Saudi Arabia. She was non-traditional, known more for wearing Chanel trouser suits rather than the veiled, conservative attire typical of Saudi women. She was neither Wahhabi nor Saudi, and her foreign origin diminished her status within the conservative Saudi family where she became known as &quot;the slave wife&quot;. 

According to Carmen bin Ladin, Muhammad was planning to wed a 23rd wife the night he died, and was heading there when his plane crashed.

== Death ==
On 3 September 1967, Muhammad bin Ladin was killed when his airplane, a Beechcraft G18S, crashed during landing in Usran, &#x27;Asir Province, in southwest Saudi Arabia. Following the crash, Muhammad&#x27;s body was carefully retrieved and prepared for burial.

At dawn the next day, a somber procession conveyed his body from the palace to a family plot in a nearby cemetery. The news of his passing brought profound sadness, as Muhammad was highly esteemed both within the bin Ladin family and amongst the people of Jeddah. The funeral procession drew an immense crowd, with nearly ten thousand people lining the route to the cemetery. King Faisal, deeply affected by the loss, was a close friend of Muhammad. After the funeral, King Faisal met with the bin Ladin family and informed the children that he was placing them under royal protection. He assured them that they would receive their fair share of the inheritance when they reached the age of 21. With the loss of Muhammad as their unifying figure, Muhammad&#x27;s many wives, ex-wives, and children began to disperse to different parts of the kingdom, although they still maintained their family connection with the Saudi Binladin Group. Muhammad&#x27;s eldest son, Salem bin Ladin, took over the family business and eventually expanded it into an international company.

== Legacy ==
Following Muhammad bin Ladin&#x27;s death, his eldest sons, principally Salem bin Laden, renamed the organization, &quot;Binladen Brothers for Contracting and Industry&quot; and continued to expand their late father&#x27;s company until it employed more than 40,000 people. Salem bin Laden died in the United States in 1988 when his ultralight aircraft collided with power lines. Many members of the bin Ladin family have moved away from Saudi Arabia and settled in Europe and the US.

In May 1990, the company was renamed the Saudi Binladin Group under the leadership of Bakr bin Laden. The Saudi Binladin Group as it is now known, is involved in construction, engineering, manufacturing, and telecommunications. Construction projects include airports, housing complexes, tunnels, and bridges. The group is also involved in city planning and real estate development. The Saudi Binladin Group is Egypt&#x27;s largest private foreign company and negotiated with the Lebanese government to rebuild part of central Beirut under a US $50 million contract.

In 2009, the bin Ladin family was listed as the 5th wealthiest Saudi family by Forbes magazine, with a reported net worth of $7 billion.

Muhammad bin Ladin is portrayed by Tim Seyfi in the 2019 OCS/Netflix miniseries &quot;The Spy&quot;.

<doc id="944781" wikidata="Q243761" url="?curid=944781" title="Scarlet macaw">
<text>The scarlet macaw (Ara macao) also called the red-and-yellow macaw, red-and-blue macaw or red-breasted macaw, is a large yellow, red and blue Neotropical parrot native to humid evergreen forests of the Americas. Its range extends from southeastern Mexico to Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Honduras, and Brazil in lowlands of (at least formerly) up to , the Caribbean island of Trinidad, as well as the Pacific island of Coiba. Formerly, the northern extent of its range included southern Tamaulipas. In some areas, it has suffered local extinction because of habitat destruction, or capture for the parrot trade, but in other areas, it remains fairly common. It is the national bird of Honduras. Like its relative the blue-and-yellow macaw, the scarlet macaw is a popular bird in aviculture as a result of its striking plumage. It is the third most common macaw species in captivity after the Blue and Gold and Greenwing Macaw respectively. In recent years it has become much rarer in captivity and much more expensive due to its placement on CITES Appendix I.

==Taxonomy==
The scarlet macaw was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Psittacus macao&quot;. The scarlet macaw is now placed in the genus &quot;Ara&quot; (Lacépède, 1799), one of 6 genera of Central and South American macaws.

The two subspecies can be recognized by size and color detail in the feathers on the wings:
* &quot;Ara macao macao&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758): South American scarlet macaw, the nominate subspecies. In the wings the medium and secondary coverts have green tips.
* &quot;A. m. cyanopterus&quot; Wiedenfeld, 1995: North Central American scarlet macaw. The Central American scarlet macaw is larger and has blue on its wings instead of green.

=== Genetics ===
In May 2013, it was announced that a team of scientists, led by Dr. Christopher M. Seabury and Dr. Ian Tizard of Texas A&amp;M University had sequenced the complete genome of the scarlet macaw. Based on this genome, species-specific microsatellite genetic markers were developed to aid genetic studies throughout the range of the species. These genetic markers were later validated on the trace amount of DNA acquired from feathers, and applied to study red-and-green macaws in a tropical landscape where DNA can degrade very quickly. These markers were proven to be useful to study their population genetics and identification of individuals in the landscape of the Peruvian Amazon.

== Description ==
It is about long, of which more than half is the pointed, graduated tail typical of all macaws, though the scarlet macaw has a larger percentage of tail than the other large macaws. The average weight is about . The plumage is mostly scarlet, but the rump and tail-covert feathers are light blue, the greater upper wing coverts are yellow, the upper sides of the flight feathers of the wings are dark blue as are the ends of the tail feathers, and the undersides of the wing and tail flight feathers are dark red with metallic gold iridescence. Some individuals may have green in the wings. The central american subspecies is larger and averages 89 cm or (35 in) in length.

There is bare white skin around the eye and from there to the bill. Tiny white feathers are contained on the face patch. The upper mandible is mostly pale horn in color and the lower is black. Juveniles have dark eyes; adults have light yellow eyes.

It is frequently confused with the slightly larger green-winged macaw, which has more distinct red lines in the face and no yellow in the wing.

Scarlet macaws make very loud, high and sometimes low-pitched, throaty squawks, squeaks and screams designed to carry many kilometers to call for their groups.

The scarlet macaw can live up to 75 or even 90 years in captivity, although a more typical lifespan is 40 to 50 years.

== Behavior ==
A typical sighting is of a single bird or a pair flying above the forest canopy, though in some areas flocks can be seen. They often gather at clay licks. Scarlet macaws communicate primarily through raucous honks; however, vocal communication is highly variable, and captive macaws are known to be adept mimics of human speech.

=== Feeding ===
Wild scarlet macaws feed on fruits, nuts, seeds, flowers and nectar.

As with smaller parrot species, there are reports of their consumption of insects, larvae, and snails; however, this seems to be rare for macaws and is not a major component of their diet. Seeds of &quot;Cnidoscolus&quot; and &quot;Schizolobium&quot; are thought to be the main sources of protein for nestling scarlet macaws.

In Costa Rica&#x27;s Central Pacific they have learned to feed on introduced Teak trees (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;) and Almond Beach Trees. Local non-profit organizations have planted hundreds of those trees along the coastline from the Tárcoles River basin to Esterillos Beach which had helped increase the population drastically. The combined efforts and the correct ecotourism also have an important role in the conservation of such majestic birds. Tour companies along the Tarcoles River and its mangroves have bet on the importance of birdwatching as an asset for the growth on its population.

=== Breeding ===

While comparatively docile at most times of the year, scarlet macaws may be formidably aggressive during periods of breeding. Scarlet macaws are monogamous birds, with individuals remaining with one partner throughout their lives. The hen lays two or three white eggs in a large tree cavity. The female incubates the eggs for about five weeks, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 90 days after hatching and leave their parents about a year later. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at five years of age.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The scarlet macaw inhabits primarily humid, lowland subtropical rain forests, open woodlands, river edges, and savannas. In some regions, they are known to periodically visit natural mineral deposits (or &#x27;licks&#x27;), typically in areas rich in clay and sediment, which the macaws will eat for digestive purposes and to glean vital nutrients, including sodium and calcium. The species&#x27; South American range is extensive, spanning much of the Amazon basin and rainforest of the northern half of the continent, extending as far south as Peru (east of the Andes) and Bolivia. In Bolivia, it is quite common in the Aquicuana Reserve, in the northeastern Beni Department (near the city of Riberalta, the capital of the Bolivian Amazon region).
In (southern) North and Central America, the species&#x27; range extends from the Yucatán Peninsula (extreme southeastern Mexico and Belize) and southward through Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, as well as the island of Coiba. It is seen infrequently on the mainland of Panamá, but is known in Costa Rica from isolated regions on the Pacific coast, mainly near the Nicoya Peninsula, Carara National Park and Peninsula de Osa.

In Florida, United States, scarlet macaws have escaped captivity at various times throughout history, either inadvertently due to hurricanes or other inclement weather events, or being deliberately released by humans; however, there is no evidence to suggest that this population is established and breeding, and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes. These non-native birds are likely sustained off of deliberate feeding by residents who enjoy seeing them in their yards. The species also occurs as an introduced species in Puerto Rico.

A small introduced population exists in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, having been introduced to the area around 2010. This population, which includes a number of related blue-and-yellow macaws, was introduced to the village around 2010; they are trained to fly freely around the area, returning to a conservation centre for food and shelter in the evenings.

== Conservation status ==
The habitat of scarlet macaws is also considered to have the greatest latitudinal range for any bird in the genus &quot;Ara&quot;, as the estimated maximum territorial range covers 6,700,000 km2. Nevertheless, the scarlet macaw&#x27;s habitat is fragmented, and the bird is mostly confined to tiny populations scattered throughout its original range in Middle America. However, as they still occur in large numbers over most of their original range in South America, the species is classified by IUCN as least concern. Its wild population is currently estimated to be between 50,000 and 499,999 individuals.

Commercial international trade in the species (including parts and derivatives) is prohibited by the bird&#x27;s listing under CITES Appendix 1 due to poaching for the pet trade.

The northern subspecies, &quot;A. m. cyanopterus&quot;, is listed as endangered by the USFWS. The USFWS estimates that only 2,000–3,000 birds of the northern subspecies remain in the wild.

== Aviculture ==
The scarlet macaw is an early example of a parrot breeding in captivity. Captive breeding occurred in Northern Mexico at Paquime (also called Casas Grandes) and very likely Southwest New Mexico Mimbres Valley in the 11th century. Breeding pens, perches, bones, and eggshell fragments have been uncovered. The straightforward nature of scarlet macaw breeding and the value of their plumes in trade created a market for trade wherein the animals were used in religious rites north to the Colorado Plateau region.

Today the scarlet macaw is found worldwide in captivity, but is best represented in captivity in the Americas. Captive techniques developed from the pet trade have positively affected wild populations: in areas with low macaws populations, the &quot;extra&quot; babies that typically die in the nest may be reared by human hands and released into the wild to bolster the population, as has been done by the Tambopata Macaw Project. Their captive diet, egg incubation, assisted hatching, hand rearing, co-parenting, parent-rearing, fledgling, maturation, and breeding are well understood within the avicultural community (AFA Watchbird magazine).

<text>Goesan County () is a county in North Chungcheong Province, South Korea.

==Demographics==
As of 2021, Goesan-gun has a population of about 40,000 people. The area has been affected strongly by the graying of the South Korean population, and more than a third of residents are over the age of 65. Schools have closed as urbanization and falling birthrates in Korea have resulted in a declining number of children to attend them. One school, to prevent closure due to low enrollment, offers free housing to families with school-age children.

==Tourist spot==
* Sanmagi-yetgil
Sanmagi-yetgil is a road that extends from Sao-rang-maeul village (Oe-sa-ri, Chilseong-myeon, Goesan-gun, Chungbuk) to Sanmagi village in the mountains. It is a stroll path restored to resemble the traditional mountain road with a picturesque landscape.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Goesan is twinned with:

<text>The Drevlians, Derevlians or Derevlianians ( or , ) were a tribe of East Slavs between the 6th and the 10th centuries, which inhabited the territories of Polesia and right-bank Ukraine, west of the eastern Polans and along the lower reaches of the rivers Teteriv, Uzh, Ubort, and Stsviha. To the west, the Drevlians&#x27; territories reached the Sluch River, where the Volhynians (related to the territory of Volhynia) and Buzhans (related to the name of Southern Bug) lived. To the north, the Drevlians&#x27; neighbors were the Dregoviches.

==Ethnonym==
Their name is derived from Slavic &quot;drevo/древо&quot; or &quot;derevo/дерево&quot;, meaning &quot;wood&quot; and &quot;tree&quot;, because they lived in the forests. Their name may be rendered &quot;the dwellers in the forest&quot;. They possibly were mentioned as &quot;Forsderen-Liudi&quot; by Bavarian Geographer in the 9th century. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; (PVL) mentioned that those Slavs who settled in open fields had been called &quot;Polyani&quot; (after the Slavic &quot;pole/поле&quot;, meaning &quot;field&quot;), and those in forest areas &quot;Drevlyani&quot;.

==Settlements==
The Drevlians left many archaeological traces, such as agricultural settlements with semi-dugouts (or earth-houses), moundless burial grounds and barrows, fortified towns like Vruchiy (present-day Ovruch), Horodske, site of an ancient settlement near Malyn (supposedly, a residence of the Drevlian prince Mal), and others. The principal city of the Drevlians was Iskorosten (today&#x27;s Korosten), where one can still see a group of compact ancient settlements. After the Kievan Rus&#x27; conquered the Drevlians, Iskorosten was burned to the ground and the capital transferred to Ovruch. By the end of the first millennium, the Drevlians already had well-developed farming and handicrafts.

==History==
The Drevlians initially fervently opposed the Kievan Rus&#x27;. According to a number of chronicles, in the times of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv (supposedly, founders of Kiev) the Drevlians had their own princely rule and were frequently at war with the &quot;Polyani&quot;. In 883, Prince Oleg of Novgorod made the Drevlians pay tribute to Kiev. In 907, the Drevlians took part in the Kievan military campaign against the Eastern Roman Empire. 
After Oleg&#x27;s death in 912 the Drevlians stopped paying tribute. The Varangian warlord Sveneld made them pay tribute to himself. Oleg&#x27;s successor Igor attempted to levy the tribute after Sveneld, but the Drevlians revolted and killed him in 945. Igor&#x27;s widow Olga avenged her husband&#x27;s death in an extremely harsh manner, killing Drevlian ambassadors and nobility, burning their capital of Iskorosten to the ground and leveling other towns. After having subjugated the Drevlians, Olga transformed their territories into a Kievan appanage with the center in Vruchiy.
The last contemporary mention of the Drevlians occurred in a chronicle of 1136, when Grand Prince Yaropolk Vladimirovich of Kiev gave their lands to the Church of the Tithes.

== In literature ==
The Drevlians are depicted in works dedicated to Kniaz Igor and Kniaginia Olga, including:
* Leopold von Sacher-Masoch&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Wedding in Kiev&quot;, 1866;
* Petro Haivoronskyі&#x27;s &quot;The Kniahynia&#x27;s Comb&quot;, 2015

<text>Chien-Chi Chang (; born 1961) is a photographer and member of Magnum Photos.

==Life and work==
Chang was born in Taichung, Taiwan. He received an MS from Indiana University, Bloomington and a B.A. from Soochow University, Taipei.

He joined Magnum Photos in 1995 and was elected as a full member in 2001.

He lives in Taichung, Taiwan, and Graz, Austria.

Chang focuses on the abstract concepts of alienation and connection. &quot;The Chain&quot;, a collection of portraits made in a mental asylum in Taiwan, was shown at Venice Biennale (2001) and the São Paulo Art Biennial (2002). The nearly life-sized photographs of pairs of patients chained together resonate with Chang&#x27;s look at the less visible bonds of marriage.

At São Paulo Art Biennial he was involved in the Thomann controversy.

Chang has treated marital ties in two books—&quot;I Do I Do I Do&quot; (2001), a collection of images depicting alienated grooms and brides in Taiwan, and in &quot;Double Happiness&quot; (2005), a depiction of the business of selling brides in Vietnam. The ties of family and of culture are also the themes of a project begun in 1992. For 21 years, Chang has photographed and videoed the bifurcated lives of Chinese immigrants in New York&#x27;s Chinatown, along with those of their wives and families back home in Fujian. Still a work in progress, &quot;China Town&quot; was hung at the National Museum of Singapore in 2008 as part of a mid-career survey and at Venice Biennale (2011) as well as at International Center of Photography, New York (2012). Chang&#x27;s investigation of the ties that bind one person to another draws on his own divided immigrant experience in the United States. In 2014, he was named one of the &quot;30 Most Influential Photographers in Asia&quot; by IPA. Other Taiwanese photographers who made the list included Chang Chao-Tang (張照堂) and Chang Tsai (張才).

<doc id="944796" wikidata="Q7090839" url="?curid=944796" title="On-line Guitar Archive">
<text>The On-line Guitar Archive (OLGA) was the first Internet library of guitar and bass tablature, or &quot;tabs&quot;. Born from a collection of guitarist internet-forum archives, it was a useful resource for musicians of all genres for over a decade.

==History==
The website began its life in the newsgroups &quot;rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature&quot; and &quot;alt.guitar.tab&quot;, where users would post tabs they had written or requests for tabs of certain songs or artists. The problem was that after a few days, the contents of the forum would be &quot;aged&quot; (i.e. removed). Around 1992 the posts were collected together by James Bender at UNLV into an ftp site that later became www.OLGA.net. In 1994 Cathal Woods took over the project as archivist.

In 1996, EMI Publishing filed a complaint with UNLV, claiming that the archive was in breach of copyright law with songs they had the rights to. Although OLGA was never threatened directly, UNLV kicked the project off its server. Then in 1998, after a new home for the site was found, OLGA received a similar copyright complaint from the Harry Fox Agency (HFA). As a result, OLGA was forced to shut down, re-emerging later as &quot;OLGA incorporated&quot;, a registered non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the archive and providing for its bandwidth. The site prior to this final move was preserved as &quot;the old archive,&quot; and contributions since the move were stored in &quot;the new archive&quot;.

In June 2006 they received a take down letter from lawyers representing the NMPA and the MPA, although by this time temporary clones of the archive had started to appear on sites such as Renegade Olga.

On March 27, 2007, HFA announced a licensing agreement with Musicnotes which &quot;authorize[d] a newly launched Musicnotes guitar tab download website that utilizes the copyrighted music of HFA’s participating music publishers on a commission free basis.&quot; Though the announcement did not specifically mention where this site would be available, the contact information for the Musicnotes representative also mentioned MXTabs.net.

Musicnotes is an internet-based sheet music retailer and publisher, offering over 400,000 pieces of digital sheet music and guitar tablature.

==Contributions==
To be a candidate for the archive, a file was required to be the author&#x27;s own work (i.e., interpretation of how to play the song) and cannot have been derived from a published music book, otherwise inclusion in OLGA would have constituted a copyright violation.

==Current status==
In 2006, the Archive removed all 34,000 tablatures on the site. A note posted on the site indicated that those running the site had received &quot;a &#x27;take down&#x27; letter from lawyers representing the National Music Publishers Association and the Music Publishers Association&quot;, according to the linked letter on the front page. In the letter it is stated that OLGA &quot;makes available tablature versions of copyrighted musical compositions owned or controlled by members of the NMPA and MPA&quot; 

Although originally a notice on the site suggested that the shutdown would only be temporary while OLGA attempted to resolve legal issues, the long time archivist for the site has indicated that the situation is permanent. On a personal web site he stated, &quot;For twelve years I ran OLGA - the On-Line Guitar Archive. RIP.&quot;

As of October 2019, the site appears to have been taken offline.

<doc id="944823" wikidata="Q283447" url="?curid=944823" title="Lambert of Maastricht">
<text>Lambert of Maastricht, commonly referred to as Saint Lambert (; Middle Dutch: &quot;Sint-Lambrecht&quot;; ; 636 – c. 705), was the bishop of Maastricht-Liège (Tongeren) from about 670 until his death. Lambert denounced Pepin&#x27;s liaison with his mistress or bigamous wife Alpaida, the mother of Charles Martel. The bishop was murdered during the political turmoil that developed when various families fought for influence as the Merovingian dynasty gave way to the Carolingians. He is considered a martyr for his defence of marriage. His feast day is September 17.

==Life==
Very little is known about the life of Lambert. According to the 14th-century chronicle-writer Jean d&#x27;Outremeuse he was the son of Apre, lord of Loon, and his wife Herisplindis, both from noble families of Maastricht. The child was baptized by his godfather, the local bishop Remaclus, and educated by Landoald, archpriest of the city and head of the noble abbey school in Wintershoven. Lambert was related to the seneschal Hugobert, the father of Plectrude, who was Pepin of Herstal&#x27;s lawful wife. He was thus an in-law of hereditary mayors of the palace who controlled the Merovingian kings of Austrasia.

Lambert appears to have frequented the Merovingian court of King Childeric II, and was a protégé of his uncle, Theodard, who succeeded Remaclus as bishop of Maastricht. He is described by early biographers as “a prudent young man of pleasing looks, courteous and well-behaved in his speech and manners, well-built, strong, a good fighter, clear-headed, affectionate, pure and humble, and fond of reading.” When Theodard was murdered soon after 669, the councillors of Childeric made Lambert bishop of Maastricht. 

After Childeric himself was murdered in 675, the faction of Ebroin, &quot;majordomo&quot; of Neustria and the power behind that throne, expelled him from his see, in favor of their candidate, Faramundus. Lambert spent seven years in exile at the recently founded Abbey of Stavelot (674–681). With a change in the turbulent political fortunes of the time, Pepin of Herstal became mayor of the palace and Lambert was allowed to return to his see. 

In company with Willibrord, who had come from England in 691, Lambert preached the gospel in the lower stretches of the Meuse, in the area to the north. In conjunction with Landrada he founded a convent at Munsterblizen. Lambert was also the spiritual director of the young noble Hubertus, eldest son of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine. Hubertus would later succeed Lambert as bishop of Maastricht.

Lambert seems to have succumbed to the political turmoil that developed when various clans fought for influence as the Merovingian dynasty gave way to the Carolingians. Historian Jean-Louis Kupper says that the bishop was the victim of a private struggle between two clans seeking to control the Tongres-Maastricht see. Lambert is said to have denounced Pepin&#x27;s adulterous liaison with Alpaida, who was to become the mother of Charles Martel. This aroused the enmity of either Pepin, Alpaida, or both. The bishop was murdered at Liège by the troops of Dodon, Pepin&#x27;s &quot;domesticus&quot; (manager of state domains), father or brother of Alpaida. The year of his death varies between sources, but is taken to be between 705 and 709. Lambert came to be viewed as a martyr for his defence of marital fidelity. Lambert&#x27;s two nephews, Peter and Audolet, were also killed defending their uncle. They too, were viewed as saints. Many historians however question the accuracy of the relationship between Alpaida and Dodon, due to that claim appearing much later. 

Although Lambert was buried at Maastricht, his successor as bishop, Hubertus, translated his relics to Liège, to which the see of Maastricht was eventually moved. To enshrine Lambert&#x27;s relics, Hubertus built a basilica near Lambert&#x27;s residence which became St. Lambert&#x27;s Cathedral That cathedral was torn down starting in 1794 (its site is the modern &quot;Place Saint-Lambert&quot;), with Lambert&#x27;s tomb being relocated to the Liège Cathedral, in which it still resides.
==Patronage==
Lambert is the patron of the city of Liège and of Freiburg im Breisgau, where a relic of his head is located since 1190.

His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church calendar is 17 September. The &quot;Lambertusfest&quot; in Münster has long been a folk holiday, celebrated for two weeks culminating on the eve of 17 September. Children build &quot;Lambertus pyramids&quot; of branches, decorated with lanterns and lamps around which they dance and sing traditional songs (known as &quot;Lambertussingen&quot; or &quot;Käskenspiel&quot;).

A few churches in Germany and Belgium are dedicated to Saint Lambert.

==Relics==
Lambert&#x27;s relics in Liège are kept in four glass jars, which in turn are held in a red box, which also holds documents related to previous examinations of the relics (done in 1896, 1938 and 1985, according to the Liège diocese). In October of 2023, they were opened again, and this time a medical investigation was to be done as well.

<doc id="944836" wikidata="Q6592390" url="?curid=944836" title="List of North American broadcast station classes">
<text>This is a list of broadcast station classes applicable in much of North America under international agreements between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Effective radiated power (ERP) and height above average terrain (HAAT) are listed unless otherwise noted.

All radio and television stations within of the US-Canada or US-Mexico border must get approval by both the domestic and foreign agency. These agencies are Industry Canada/Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) in Canada, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US, and the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) in Mexico.

== AM ==
===Station class descriptions=== 
All domestic (United States) AM stations are classified as A, B, C, or D. 

* A (formerly I) — clear-channel stations — 10 kW to 50 kW, 24 hours. 
**Class A stations are only protected within a radius of the transmitter site. 
**The old Class I was divided into three: Class I-A, I-B and I-N. NARBA distinguished between Class I-A, which were true clear-channel stations that did not share their channel with another Class I station, and Class I-B, in which a station operated with 50 kW at night but shared its channel with at least one other I-B station, requiring directional operation. This distinction was superseded by the Regional Agreement for the Medium Frequency Broadcasting Service in Region 2 (Rio Agreement), which instituted the current class system.
**The former Class I-As are omnidirectional, with the exception of 870 WWL New Orleans and 1030 WBZ Boston, which use directional antennas to put a better signal over their largest population areas. 
**Most former Class I-Bs are directional at night, although a few are also directional during days. (A handful of I-Bs did not have to use directional antennas: 680 KNBR San Francisco, 810 WGY Schenectady, 850 KOA Denver, 940 XEQ Mexico City, 1070 KNX Los Angeles and 1070 CBA Moncton. KNX and CBA were far enough apart that both could operate without using a directional antenna. XEQ is far enough from Montreal that it did not need a directional antenna. KNBR and KOA are the only Class Is on their frequency but share those frequencies with several Class II-Bs.)
**Former Class I-N stations exist only in Alaska, where they are too remote to interfere with other clear-channel stations in the contiguous 48 states. They are only held to Class B efficiency standards (although higher efficiency is acceptable).
**No new Class A stations are licensed in the conterminous United States, although the FCC states it may be possible to license additional Class A stations in Alaska.
* B (formerly II and III) — regional stations — 250 W to 50 kW, 24 hours. 
**Stations on the AM expanded band, 1610 kHz to 1700 kHz, are limited to 10 kW days and 1 kW nights, non-directionally.
**Several expanded band stations operate DA-N or even DA-2 with up to 10 kW during all hours, after providing proof that such operations will not cause co- or adjacent-channel interference. 
**If under 250 W at night, the antenna must be efficient enough to radiate more than 140.82 mV/m at 1 km.
* C (formerly IV) — local unlimited-time stations — 250 W to 1 kW, 24 hours. 
**Class C stations that were licensed at 100 W are grandfathered. 
**Rare Class Cs operate with directional arrays, such as KYPA and KHCB.
* D (formerly II-D, II-S, III-S) — current and former daytimers — Daytime 250 W to 50 kW, nighttime under 250 W or off-air.
**Field strength is limited to 140 mV/m (millivolts per meter) at 1 km. 
**No new class D stations are licensed, with the exception of Class B stations that are downgrading their nighttime operations to Class D (i.e., less than 250 W). The station&#x27;s daytime operation is then also reclassified as Class D.
**If a Class D station is on the air at night, it is not protected from any co-channel interference.
* TIS/HAR — travelers&#x27; information stations / highway advisory radio stations — Up to 10 W transmitter output power. Stations within US national parks are licensed by NTIA and not the FCC.
* Unlicensed broadcasting — (see low-power broadcasting) — 100 mW DC input to final amplifier with a maximum length radiator, no license needed, may be measured at edge of campus for school stations and neighborhood broadcasters.

Notes:
* In the Western Hemisphere (ITU region 2), medium wave AM broadcasts are on channels spaced 10 kHz apart from 530 kHz to 1700 kHz, with certain classes restricted to subsets of the available frequencies.
* With few exceptions, Class A stations can be found only on the frequencies of 540 kHz, 640 to 780 kHz, 800 to 900 kHz, 940 kHz, 990 to 1140 kHz, 1160 to 1220 kHz, and 1500 to 1580 kHz. The exceptions are cited in relevant international treaties.
* While US and Canadian Class A stations are authorized to operate at a maximum of 50,000 watts day and night (and a minimum of 10,000 watts at night, if grandfathered), certain existing Mexican Class A stations, and certain new Cuban Class A stations are authorized to operate at a higher power. Certain Mexican Class A stations are authorized to operate at less than 50,000 watts at night, if grandfathered, but may operate at up to 100,000 watts during the day.
* Class B and D stations can be found on any frequencies from 540 kHz to 1700 kHz except where frequencies have been reserved for Class C stations.
* Class C stations can be found in the lower 48 US states on the frequencies of 1230 kHz, 1240 kHz, 1340 kHz, 1400 kHz, 1450 kHz, and 1490 kHz (commonly known as &quot;graveyard&quot; frequencies). Other countries may use other frequencies for their Class C stations.
* American territories in ITU region 3 with AM broadcasting stations (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) use the 9 kHz spacing customary to the rest of the world. All stations are class B or lower. 
* Canada also defines Class CC (Carrier Current, restricted to the premises) and LP. (less than 100 watts)
* TIS stations can be found on any frequency from 530 kHz to 1700 kHz in the US, but may only carry non-commercial messages without music. There is a network of TISs on 1710 in New Jersey.
* Low-power AM stations located on a school campus are allowed to be more powerful, so long as their signal strength does not exceed roughly 14 to 45 μV/m (microvolts per meter) (depending on frequency) at a distance of 30 meters (98.4 ft) from campus.

====Former system====
AM station classes were previously assigned Roman numerals from I to IV in the US, with subclasses indicated by a letter suffix. Current class A is equivalent to the old class I; class B is the old classes II and III, with class D being the II-D, II-S, and III-S subclasses; and class C is the old class IV.

The following conversion table compares the old AM station classes with the new AM station classes:

=== AM station classes and clear channels listed by frequency ===
The following chart lists frequencies on the broadcast company band, and which classes broadcast on these frequencies; Class A and Class B, 10,000 watt and higher (full-time) stations in North America which broadcast on clear-channel station frequencies are also shown.

By international agreement, Class A stations must be 10,000 watts and above, with a 50,000 watt maximum for the US and Canada, but no maximum for other governments in the region. Mexico, for example, typically runs 150,000 to 500,000 watts, but some stations are grandfathered at 10,000 to 20,000 watts at night; by treaty, these sub-50,000 watt Mexican stations may operate with a maximum of 100,000 watts during the daytime.

Because the AM broadcast band developed before technology suitable for directional antennas, there are numerous exceptions, such as the US use of 800 (kHz) and 900 non-directionally in Alaska, limited to 5 kW at night; and 1050 and 1220, directionally, in the continental US, and without time limits; each of these being assigned to specific cities (and each of these being Mexican Class I-A clear channels). In return for these limits on US stations, Mexico accepted limits on 830 and 1030 in Mexico City, non-directionally, restricted to 5 kW at night (both of these being US Class I-A clear channels).

===Station class description===


Notes:
* Canada protects all radio stations out to a signal strength of 0.5mV/m (54dBu), whereas only commercial B stations in the US are. Commercial B1 in the US is 0.7mV/m (57dBu), and all other stations are 1.0mV/m (60dBu). Noncommercial-band stations (88.1 to 91.9) are not afforded this protection, and are treated as C3 and C2 even when they are B1 or B. C3 and C2 may also be reported internationally as B1 and B, respectively.
* Class C0 is for former C stations, demoted at request of another station which needs the downgrade to accommodate its own facilities.
* In practice, many stations are above the maximum HAAT for a particular class, and correspondingly must downgrade their power to remain below the reference distance. Conversely, they may &quot;not&quot; increase power if they are &quot;below&quot; maximum HAAT.
* All class D (including L1 and L2 LPFM and translator) stations are secondary in the US, and can be bumped or forced off-air completely, even if they are not just a repeater and are the only station a licensee has.
* The United States is divided into regions that have different restrictions for FM stations. Zone I (much of the US Northeast and Midwest) and I-A (most of California, plus Puerto Rico) is limited to classes B and B1, while Zone II (everything else) has only the C classes. All areas have the same classes for A and D.
* Power and height restrictions were put in place in 1962. A number of previously existing stations were grandfathered in, such as KRUZ in Santa Barbara, California, and WLFP in Memphis, Tennessee.

The following table lists the various classes of FM stations, the reference facilities for each station class, and the protected and city grade contours for each station class:

Historically, there were local &quot;Class A&quot; frequencies (like AM radio&#x27;s class C stations) to which only class A stations would be allocated &amp; the other frequencies could not have a class A. According to the 1982 FCC rules &amp; regulations, those frequencies were: 92.1, 92.7, 93.5, 94.3, 95.3, 95.9, 96.7, 97.7, 98.3, 99.3, 100.1, 100.9, 101.7, 102.3, 103.1, 103.9, 104.9, 105.5, 106.3 &amp; 107.1. Stations on those twenty frequencies were limited to having equivalent signals no greater that 3KW at above average terrain.

=== FM zones ===

The US is divided into three zones for FM broadcasting: I, I-A and II. The zone where a station is located may limit the choices of broadcast class available to a given FM station.

Zone I in the US includes all of Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. It also includes the areas south of latitude 43.5°N in Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont; as well as coastal Maine, southeastern Wisconsin, and northern and eastern Virginia.

Zone I-A includes California south of 40°N, as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

Zone II includes the remainder of the continental US, plus Alaska and Hawaii.

In Zones I and I-A, there are no Class C, C0, or C1 stations. However, there are a few Class B stations with grandfathered power limits in excess of 50 KW, such as WETA (licensed for Washington DC in zone I, at a power of 75 kW ERP), WNCI (Columbus, Ohio in zone I, at 175 kW ERP), KPFK (Los Angeles in zone I-A, at 110 KW ERP), and the most extreme example being WBCT (Grand Rapids, Michigan, in zone I, at 320  kW ERP).

== TV ==

=== Full-power stations in the US ===
* VHF low (2-6): 100 kW video analog at in Zone I and in Zone II and Zone III above average terrain; 10 kW in Zone I and 45 kW in Zone II and Zone III digital at above average terrain
* VHF high (7-13): 316 kW video analog at in Zone I and in Zone II and Zone III above average terrain; 30 kW in Zone I and 160 kW in Zone II and Zone III digital at above average terrain
* UHF (14-36): video analog at above average terrain; digital at above average terrain

Notes:

All full-power analog television station transmissions in the US were terminated at midnight Eastern Daylight Time on June 12, 2009. Many broadcasters replaced their analog signal with their digital ATSC signal on the same transmission channel at that time.

* All US digital stations received a -DT suffix during the analog-to-digital transition. At analog shutdown, the FCC assigned to each digital station the call sign its associated analog station had used. (with a -TV suffix if the analog station had this suffix, without the -TV suffix if the analog station didn&#x27;t have it). Stations could optionally choose to keep the -DT suffix. Most stations did not keep the -DT suffix.
* For US analog stations, the -TV suffix was required if there was a radio station with the same three- or four-letter callsign. Stations not required to use the -TV suffix may optionally request it if desired.
* Analog audio power was limited to 22% of video.

=== Full-power stations in Canada ===
* Class A: UHF, 10 kW video/ EHAAT
* Class B: UHF, 100 kW video/ EHAAT
* Class C: UHF, video/ EHAAT (?)
* Class D: UHF, more than / EHAAT
* Class R: VHF, 100 kW low-band (channels 2–6), 325 kW high-band. (channels 7-13)
* Class S: VHF, more than 100 kW low-band/325 kW high-band.

Notes:
* Official definitions of these classes are difficult to locate. The values above are inferred from the Industry Canada database. There is some ambiguity about the difference between Classes C and D.
* Power-level limitations are not firmly enforced in Canada, and Industry Canada has been known to license stations for power levels much higher than the generally accepted limits. For example, CFRN-TV in Edmonton, Alberta operated on Channel 3 at over 600 kW but was not subject to international co-ordination due to its location north of the border.
* In Canada, the callsigns of all private TV stations have the -TV suffix. Most CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé TV callsigns end in the letter T and have no suffix. A few Radio-Canada stations, purchased by the CBC from private owners, retain the old -TV callsigns.
* Canadian digital stations all receive the -DT suffix. (this includes CBC and Radio-Canada stations) The Industry Canada database shows -PT suffixes for the channel allotments for permanent post-transition digital operation but when licences are issued for these permanent digital stations, -DT callsigns are used.

=== Low-power TV (US) ===

LPTV (secondary) (suffix: -LP, or a sequential-numbered callsign in format W##XX with no suffix for analog or with -D suffix for digital, or -LD for low-power digital stations):
* VHF: 3 kW analog video; 3 kW digital 
* UHF: 150 kW analog video; 15 kW digital
* Experimental
* Unlicensed: not allowed except for medical telemetry, and certain wireless microphones

The LPTV (low-power television) service was created in 1982 by the FCC to allocate channels for smaller, local stations, and community channels, such as public access stations. LPTV stations that meet additional requirements such as children&#x27;s &quot;E/I&quot; core programming and Emergency Alert System broadcasting capabilities can qualify for a Class A (-CA) license.

Broadcast translators, boosters, and other LPTV stations are considered secondary to full-power stations, unless they have upgraded to class A. Class A is still considered LPTV with respect to stations in Canada and Mexico.

==== Class A television (US) ====

Class-A stations (US) (suffix: -CA or -CD for digital class A):
* VHF: 3 kW analog video; 3 kW digital
* UHF: 150 kW analog video; 15 kW digital

The class-A television class is a variant of LPTV created in 2000 by the FCC to allocate and protect some low-power affiliates. Class-A stations are still low-power, but are protected from RF interference and from having to change channel should a full-service station request that channel.

Additionally, class-A stations, LPTV stations, and translators are the only stations currently authorized to broadcast both analog and digital signals, unlike full-power stations which must broadcast a digital signal only.

=== Low-power TV (Canada) ===
In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is considered broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada considers that a low power digital television undertaking &quot;shall not normally extend a distance of 20 km in any direction from the antenna site,&quot; based on the determined noise-limited bounding contour.

=== Mexico ===
All digital television stations in Mexico have -TDT callsign suffixes. Analog stations, which existed until December 31, 2016, had -TV callsign suffixes.

The equivalent of low power or translator service in Mexico is the &quot;equipo complementario de zona de sombra&quot;, which is intended only to fill in gaps between a station&#x27;s expected and actual service area caused by terrain; a station of this type shares the callsign of another station. In analog, these services often were broadcast on the same or adjacent channels to their parent station, except in certain areas with tight packing of television stations (such as central Mexico). In digital, these services usually operate on the same RF channel as their parent station, except for those with conflicting full-power applications (XHBS-TDT Cd. Obregón, Son., channel 30 instead of 25), in certain other cases where it is technically not feasible (XHAW-TDT Guadalupe, NL, channel 26 instead of 25) or to make way for eventual repacking on upper UHF (XHPNW-TDT has four shadows on 33, its post-repacking channel, instead of 39).

&quot;Equipos complementarios&quot; can relay their parent station, or a station that carries 75% or more of the same programming as its parent station.

Stations of either type may have unusually low or high effective radiated powers. XHSMI-TDT in Oaxaca is licensed for two watts in digital. The highest-powered shadows are XEQ-TDT Toluca and XHBS-TDT Ciudad Obregón, both at 200 kW.

<text>Vitaly Venediktovich Scherbo (born 13 January 1972) is a Belarusian former artistic gymnast. One of the most successful gymnasts of all time, he is the only male gymnast ever to have won a world title in all 8 events (individual all-around in 1993, team in 1991, floor in 1994, 1995 and 1996, horizontal bar in 1994, parallel bars in 1993 and 1995, pommel horse in 1992, rings in 1992, vault in 1993 and 1994). He was the most successful athlete at the 1992 Summer Olympics, winning 6 of 8 events – team, all-around, and 4 of the 6 event finals.

==Career==
His first international performances were in 1990–1991, when he competed for the USSR team at the World Championship and the World Cup. He was the 1991 World All-Around silver medalist behind teammate Grigori Misutin; scored a perfect 10.0 on the vault at the European Championships in 1990; and starred at the Goodwill Games in Seattle. He had occasional bouts of inconsistency and as the 1992 Barcelona Olympics approached, the Unified Team coaches regarded him as less of a medal prospect than his more experienced and reliable teammates. In one of the most dominant performances in history, Scherbo won six out of the possible eight awarded gold medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. His golds came in the team event, the all-around, pommel horse (tie), rings, vault, and parallel bars.

Scherbo and his wife Irina relocated to the United States, settling in State College, Pennsylvania. The move enabled them to take advantage of Scherbo&#x27;s Olympic success. He followed up on his Olympic accomplishments placing first in the 1993 World All-Around title, third place in 1994 and second place in 1995&#x27;s World All-Around title.

On 13 December 1995, Scherbo&#x27;s wife Irina was involved in a single car accident, in which she skidded off a road, and slammed into a tree. She suffered multiple fractures to her ribs and pelvis, lapsed into a coma, and her internal injuries were so severe that doctors told her husband that she only had a 1 in 100 chance of surviving. Scherbo stopped his training altogether. He gained 15 pounds, and began abusing alcohol. After a month, Irina finally woke up from her coma, and insisted that her husband resume his training for the upcoming Olympic season. As his wife made a recovery, Scherbo similarly began to regain peak physical condition, winning yet another World title in 1996. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, his performances reflected his lack of preparation time, both due to his wife&#x27;s accident and a recent shoulder surgery.

Scherbo had planned to compete in the 1997 World Championships but broke his hand in a motorcycle accident before then and retired soon after.

== Alleged rape ==
In October 2017, former Ukrainian Olympic champion gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused Scherbo of violently raping her when she was 15, when they were at the USSR national team training camp in 1991.

==Eponymous skills==
Scherbo (vault) – a Yurchenko-style vault defined by its unique entry, specifically a full twist within the back-handspring between the springboard and the vaulting table.

<doc id="944846" wikidata="Q838108" url="?curid=944846" title="Volatile (computer programming)">
<text>In computer programming, a value is said to be volatile if it can be read or modified asynchronously by something other than the current thread of execution. 
The value of a codice_1 variable may spontaneously change for reasons such as:
sharing values with other threads; 
sharing values with asynchronous signal handlers;
accessing hardware devices via memory-mapped I/O (where you can send and receive messages from peripheral devices by reading from and writing to memory).
Support for these use cases varies considerably among the several programming language that have the codice_1 keyword.
Volatility can have implications regarding function calling conventions and how variables are stored, accessed and cached.

==In C and C++==

In C and C++, codice_1 is a type qualifier, like codice_4, and is a part of a type (e.g. the type of a variable or field). 

The behavior of the codice_1 keyword in C and C++ is sometimes given in terms of suppressing optimizations of an optimizing compiler: 1- don&#x27;t remove existing codice_1 reads and writes, 2- don&#x27;t add new codice_1 reads and writes, and 3- don&#x27;t reorder codice_1 reads and writes. However, this definition is only an approximation for the benefit of new learners, and this approximate definition should not be relied upon to write real production code.

In C, and consequently C++, the codice_1 keyword was intended to:
*Allow access to memory-mapped I/O devices.
*Allow preserving values across a codice_10.
*Allow sharing values between signal handlers and the rest of the program in codice_1 codice_12 objects.

The C and C++ standards allow writing portable code that shares values across a codice_10 in codice_1 objects, and the standards allow writing portable code that shares values between signal handlers and the rest of the code in codice_1 codice_12 objects. Any other use of codice_1 keyword in C and C++ is inherently non-portable or incorrect. In particular, writing code with the codice_1 keyword for memory-mapped I/O devices is inherently non-portable and always requires deep knowledge of the specific target C/C++ implementation and platform. 

=== Multi-Threading ===
It is a common misconception that the codice_1 keyword is useful in portable multi-threading code in C and C++. The codice_1 keyword in C and C++ has &quot;never&quot; functioned as a useful, portable tool for &quot;any&quot; multi-threading scenario. Unlike the Java and C# programming languages, operations on codice_1 variables in C and C++ are not atomic, and operations on codice_1 variables do not have sufficient memory ordering guarantees (i.e. memory barriers). Most C and C++ compilers, linkers, and runtimes simply do not provide the necessary memory ordering guarantees to make the codice_1 keyword useful for &quot;any&quot; multi-threading scenario. Before the C11 and C++11 standards, programmers were forced to rely on guarantees from the individual implementations and platforms (e.g. POSIX and WIN32) to write multi-threading code. With the modern C11 and C++11 standards, programmers can write portable multi-threading code using new portable constructs such as the codice_24 templates. 

===Example of memory-mapped I/O in C===
In this example, the code sets the value stored in codice_25 to codice_26. It then starts to poll that value repeatedly until it changes to codice_27:
static int foo;

void bar(void) {
 foo = 0;

 while (foo != 255)
}
An optimizing compiler will notice that no other code can possibly change the value stored in codice_25, and will assume that it will remain equal to codice_26 at all times. The compiler will therefore replace the function body with an infinite loop similar to this:
void bar_optimized(void) {
 foo = 0;

 while (true)
}
However, the programmer may make codice_25 refer to another element of the computer system such as a hardware register of a device connected to the CPU which may change the value of codice_25 while this code is running. (This example does not include the details on how to make codice_25 refer to a hardware register of a device connected to the CPU.) Without the codice_1 keyword, an optimizing compiler will likely convert the code from the first sample with the read in the loop to the second sample without the read in the loop as part of the common loop-invariant code-motion optimization, and thus the code will likely never notice the change that it is waiting for.

To prevent the compiler from doing this optimization, the codice_1 keyword can be used:
static volatile int foo;

void bar (void) {
 foo = 0;

 while (foo != 255)
}
The codice_1 keyword prevents the compiler from moving the read out of the loop, and thus the code will notice the expected change to the variable codice_25.

===Optimization comparison in C===
The following C programs, and accompanying assembler language excerpts, demonstrate how the codice_1 keyword affects the compiler&#x27;s output. The compiler in this case was GCC.

While observing the assembly code, it is clearly visible that the code generated with codice_1 objects is more verbose, making it longer so the nature of codice_1 objects can be fulfilled. The codice_1 keyword prevents the compiler from performing optimization on code involving volatile objects, thus ensuring that each volatile variable assignment and read has a corresponding memory access. Without the codice_1 keyword, the compiler knows a variable does not need to be reread from memory at each use, because there should not be any writes to its memory location from any other thread or process.

=== Standards Defects ===
While intended by both C and C++, the current C standard fails to express that the codice_1 semantics refer to the lvalue, not the referenced object. The respective defect report &quot;DR 476&quot; (to C11) is still under review with C17.

=== Compiler Defects ===
Unlike other language features of C and C++, the codice_1 keyword is not well supported by most C/C++ implementations - even for portable uses according to the C and C++ standards. Most C/C++ implementations are buggy regarding the behavior of the codice_1 keyword. Programmers should take great care whenever using the codice_1 keyword in C and C++.

==In Java==
In all modern versions of the Java programming language, the codice_1 keyword gives the following guarantees:

* codice_1 reads and writes are atomic. In particular, reads and writes to codice_48 and codice_49 fields will not tear. (The atomic guarantee applies only to the codice_1 primitive value or the codice_1 reference value, and &quot;not&quot; to any Object value.)
* There is a single global ordering of all codice_1 reads and writes. In other words, a codice_1 read will read the current value (and not a past or future value), and all codice_1 reads will agree on a single global order of codice_1 writes.
* codice_1 reads and writes have &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; memory barrier semantics (known in the Java standard as happens-before). In other words, codice_1 provides guarantees about the relative order of codice_1 and non-codice_1 reads and writes. In other words, codice_1 basically provides the same memory visibility guarantees as a Java synchronized block (but without the mutual exclusion guarantees of a synchronized block).

Together, these guarantees make codice_1 into a useful multi-threading construct in Java. In particular, the typical double-checked locking algorithm with codice_1 works correctly in Java. 

=== Early Versions Of Java ===
Before Java version 5, the Java standard did not guarantee the relative ordering of codice_1 and non-codice_1 reads and writes. In other words, codice_1 did not have &quot;acquire&quot; and &quot;release&quot; memory barrier semantics. This greatly limited its use as a multi-threading construct. In particular, the typical double-checked locking algorithm with codice_1 did &quot;not&quot; work correctly.

==In C#==

In C#, codice_1 ensures that code accessing the field is not subject to some thread-unsafe optimizations that may be performed by the compiler, the CLR, or by hardware. When a field is marked codice_1, the compiler is instructed to generate a &quot;memory barrier&quot; or &quot;fence&quot; around it, which prevents instruction reordering or caching tied to the field. When reading a codice_1 field, the compiler generates an &quot;acquire-fence&quot;, which prevents other reads and writes to the field from being moved &quot;before&quot; the fence. When writing to a codice_1 field, the compiler generates a &quot;release-fence&quot;; this fence prevents other reads and writes to the field from being moved &quot;after&quot; the fence.

Only the following types can be marked codice_1: all reference types, codice_72, codice_73, codice_74, codice_75, codice_76, codice_77, codice_78, codice_79, codice_80, and all enumerated types with an underlying type of codice_74, codice_75, codice_76, codice_77, codice_78, or codice_79. (This excludes value structs, as well as the primitive types codice_87, codice_88, codice_89 and codice_90.)

Using the codice_1 keyword does not support fields that are passed by reference or captured local variables; in these cases, codice_92 and codice_93 must be used instead.

In effect, these methods disable some optimizations usually performed by the C# compiler, the JIT compiler, or the CPU itself. The guarantees provided by codice_92 and codice_93 are a superset of the guarantees provided by the codice_1 keyword: instead of generating a &quot;half fence&quot; (ie an acquire-fence only prevents instruction reordering and caching that comes before it), codice_97 and codice_98 generate a &quot;full fence&quot; which prevent instruction reordering and caching of that field in both directions. These methods work as follows:
*The codice_93 method forces the value in the field to be written to at the point of the call. In addition, any earlier program-order loads and stores must occur before the call to codice_98 and any later program-order loads and stores must occur after the call.
*The codice_92 method forces the value in the field to be read from at the point of the call. In addition, any earlier program-order loads and stores must occur before the call to codice_97 and any later program-order loads and stores must occur after the call.

The codice_92 and codice_93 methods generate a full fence by calling the codice_105 method, which constructs a memory barrier that works in both directions. In addition to the motivations for using a full fence given above, one potential problem with the codice_1 keyword that is solved by using a full fence generated by codice_105 is as follows: due to the asymmetric nature of half fences, a codice_1 field with a write instruction followed by a read instruction may still have the execution order swapped by the compiler. Because full fences are symmetric, this is not a problem when using codice_105.

==In Fortran==
codice_110 is part of the Fortran 2003 standard, although earlier version supported it as an extension. Making all variables codice_1 in a function is also useful finding aliasing related bugs.

integer, volatile :: i ! When not defined volatile the following two lines of code are identical
write(*,*) i**2 ! Loads the variable i once from memory and multiplies that value times itself
write(*,*) i*i ! Loads the variable i twice from memory and multiplies those values
By always &quot;drilling down&quot; to memory of a VOLATILE, the Fortran compiler is precluded from reordering reads or writes to volatiles. This makes visible to other threads actions done in this thread, and vice versa.

Use of VOLATILE reduces and can even prevent optimization.

The three deities who are most commonly referred to as the &quot;Capitoline Triad&quot; are Jupiter, the king of the gods; Juno (in her aspect as &quot;Iuno Regina&quot;, &quot;Queen Juno&quot;), his wife and sister; and Jupiter&#x27;s daughter Minerva, the goddess of wisdom. This grouping of a male god and two goddesses was highly unusual in ancient Indo-European religions, and is possibly derived from the Etruscan trio of Tinia, the supreme deity, Uni, his wife, and Menrva, their daughter and the goddess of wisdom.

In some interpretations, this group replaced an original Archaic Triad made up of Jupiter, the farming/war god Mars and war/farming god Quirinus. 

===The Capitolia===

Jupiter, Juno and Minerva were honored in temples known as &quot;Capitolia&quot;, which were built on hills and other prominent areas in many cities in Italy and the provinces, particularly during the Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods. Most had a triple &quot;cella&quot;. The earliest known example of a outside Italy was at Emporion (now Empúries, Spain). According to Ovid, Terminus also had a place there, since he had a shrine there before it was built and, as the god of boundary stones, refused to yield.

Although the word &quot;Capitolium&quot; (pl. &quot;Capitolia&quot;) could be used to refer to any temple dedicated to the Capitoline Triad, it referred especially to the temple on the Capitoline Hill in Rome known as &quot;aedes Iovis Optimi Maximi Capitolini&quot; (&quot;Temple of Jupiter Best and Greatest on the Capitoline&quot;). The temple was believed to have been built under the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome prior to the establishment of the Roman Republic. Although the temple was shared by Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, each deity had a separate &quot;cella&quot;, with Juno Regina on the left, Minerva on the right, and Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the middle. It included a podium and a tetrastyle (four-columned) pronaos (porch).

Another shrine (&quot;sacellum&quot;) dedicated to Jupiter, Juno Regina and Minerva was the Capitolium Vetus on the Quirinal Hill. It was thought to be older than the more famous temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, and was still a landmark in Martial&#x27;s time, in the late 1st century.

<text>Herbert Marsh (10 December 1757 – 1 May 1839) was a bishop in the Church of England.

==Life==
The son of Richard Marsh (1709–1779), Vicar of Faversham in Kent, Marsh was born there and educated at Faversham Grammar School, the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA as second wrangler and was elected a fellow of St John&#x27;s in 1779, the year of the death of his father. He won prizes in 1780 and 1781, proceeded to MA in 1782 and to Bachelor of Divinity in 1792.

While retaining his fellowship at St John&#x27;s, Marsh studied with J. D. Michaelis at Halle in Prussia and learned the higher criticism. When he returned to England, he translated Michaelis&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to the New Testament&quot; and added to it his own hypothesis on the problem of the Synoptic Gospels. Arguing from textual analysis, he advanced a proto-gospel hypothesis, a variant and modification of the contemporary claim by Johann Gottfried Eichhorn. His &quot;Dissertation&quot; (1801) deduced that there had been an original Aramaean gospel-narrative which had been translated into Greek, and had been circulated in copies into which additional information was afterwards added or interpolated. St Mark (he claimed) had had access to two such copies containing variant additions (some of which had been interpolated into those texts), and drew upon both copies when compiling his own Gospel. These same two copies each then independently received further additions (from a &quot;Gnomology&quot; or Hebrew document of sayings and precepts of Christ), before one of them was employed by St Matthew, and the other by St Luke, when compiling their Gospels. He drew in the claim that St Matthew&#x27;s Gospel had originally been written in Hebrew, and that when it was afterwards translated into Greek the translator was able to make use of passages for which he found existing Greek versions in St Mark and St Luke. His hypothesis, now itself superseded, in its time offered a challenge to the conventional or received explanations. It brought him under attack from the conservatives of his church, and into a published debate with John Randolph, then Bishop of Oxford and Regius Professor of Greek in the University of Oxford.

He was Junior Bursar of St John&#x27;s for the year 1801–1802. In 1805 he began to preach against Calvinism in a series of sermons &quot;in which he denounced the doctrines of justification by faith without works, and of the impossibility of falling from grace, as giving a license to immoral living&quot;, which brought him into conflict with the Evangelicals, such as Charles Simeon and Isaac Milner. In 1807 he resigned his fellowship at St John&#x27;s on being elected as the Lady Margaret&#x27;s Professor of Divinity at Cambridge and began presenting lectures there on Higher Criticism. He was the first person in the theological school there to give his lectures in English rather than the traditional Latin. In 1808 he was awarded the Oxford degree of Doctor of Divinity, before in 1816 he was appointed the bishop of Llandaff in Glamorgan, where he succeeded Bishop Richard Watson. Watson was more tolerant than Marsh toward seceding Methodist clergy. Marsh was anti-methodist and &quot;made life difficult for any of his clergy with methodist tendencies.&quot; In 1819 he was translated to Peterborough.

As a bishop, Marsh was controversial for preaching against the Evangelicals and for refusing to license clergy with Calvinist beliefs (for which he incurred the ire of Sydney Smith). He was a rigorous proponent of strict ecclesiastical conformity.

Marsh&#x27;s library, consisting of 1346 lots, was sold at auction by Edmund Hodgson on 3 July 1839 (and three following days). A copy of the catalogue is in Cambridge University Library (Munby.c.115[11]).

<doc id="944866" wikidata="Q740085" url="?curid=944866" title="Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal">
<text>The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (GWOT-EM) is a United States Armed Forces award created by George W. Bush on 12 March 2003, through Executive Order 13289. The medal recognizes those military service members who have deployed overseas in direct service to the War on Terror from 11 September 2001 to a date to be determined. Prior to 30 April 2005, the medal was awarded for service within Iraq and Afghanistan, but has been replaced with the Iraq Campaign Medal and Afghanistan Campaign Medal and serves primarily as recognition for personnel who have deployed in support of the War on Terror to locations beyond Iraq and Afghanistan. In a similar fashion the Inherent Resolve Campaign Medal is issued for service in the fight against ISIS, with eligibility retroactive to 15 June 2014.

The War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal was designed by John Sproston of the Army&#x27;s Institute of Heraldry.

==Operations and devices==
The following are the approved operations and respective dates for the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal (retroactive to 11 September 2001) 

Note: Enduring Freedom name is still in operational use today for deployments to the Middle East, OEF encompasses Operation JUNIPER SHIELD, OCTAVE SHIELD and SPARTAN SHIELD.
Examples of campaign stars worn on the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal service ribbon:
The following ribbon devices are authorized for wear on the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal:

* Campaign stars (all branches)
* Arrowhead device (Army, Air Force, and Space Force)
* Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia (Navy personnel assigned to a Marine Corps unit in combat)

==Criteria==
To be awarded the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal a military service member must perform duty in a deployed status and must participate in designated anti-terrorism operation for a period of either 30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days of duty. For those who were engaged in combat, killed, or wounded in the line of duty, the time requirement is waived. The term &quot;deployed status&quot; indicates either temporary or permanent orders to a duty station outside the borders of the United States of America with such duty being in direct support of anti-terrorism operations. For a service member to receive the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the deployment must also have taken place in a nation which is currently recognized as a base for anti-terrorism operations by the United States Department of Defense.

On 30 April 2005, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal was discontinued for service within Iraq and Afghanistan, with such service recognized with the Iraq Campaign Medal or Afghanistan Campaign Medal. Personnel who received the GWOT-EM for previous service in these two regions may elect to exchange the GWOT-EM or retain the original award.

On February 9, 2015, the Defense Department authorized service stars to be worn on the GWOT-EM to represent different operations the recipient participated in.

The GWOT-EM is a Defense Department expeditionary medal. Award of this medal does not prevent award of other types of recognition (such as decorations) normally associated with deployment. This medal may be awarded posthumously.

The Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal may be awarded for approved operations performed in any of the following geographical areas:

* Service stars - effective 9 February 2015, to recognize individual participation in each of the approved operations that a service member participates in, a inch bronze service star is worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal, with a inch silver star being worn in lieu of five bronze stars.
* Fleet Marine Force Combat Operation Insignia - for qualified Navy service members such as hospital corpsmen assigned to Marine Corps units that participate in combat during the assignment.

==Expeditionary Medal and Service Medal==
A similar medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal (GWOT-SM), was created under the same Presidential Order that authorized the GWOT Expeditionary Medal. The primary difference between the two awards is that the service medal is intended for those who performed support duty within the United States, while the expeditionary medal recognizes those who were deployed to foreign countries. For those participating in multiple operations, both the GWOT Service and GWOT Expeditionary Medal may be authorized, but both medals can no longer be bestowed for the same qualifying period of service. The only exception is for service personnel who served in Iraq or Afghanistan prior to 30 April 2005. These personnel were awarded both the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.

<doc id="944870" wikidata="Q1094499" url="?curid=944870" title="ALGOL 58">
<text>ALGOL 58, originally named IAL, is a member of the ALGOL family of computer programming languages. It was an early compromise design soon superseded by ALGOL 60. According to John Backus:

The Zurich ACM-GAMM Conference had two principal motives in proposing the IAL: (a) To provide a means of communicating numerical methods and other procedures between people, and (b) To provide a means of realizing a stated process on a variety of machines...

ALGOL 58 introduced the fundamental notion of the compound statement, but it was restricted to control flow only, and it was not tied to identifier scope in the way that Algol 60&#x27;s blocks were.

==Name==
Bauer attributes the name to Hermann Bottenbruch, who coined the term &quot;algorithmic language&quot; (algorithmische Sprache) in 1957, &quot;at least in Germany&quot;.

==History==
There were proposals for a universal language by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and also by the German Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (&quot;Society of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;) (GAMM). It was decided to organize a joint meeting to combine them. The meeting took place from May 27 to June 2, 1958, at ETH Zurich and was attended by the following people:
* Friedrich L. Bauer, Hermann Bottenbruch, Heinz Rutishauser, and Klaus Samelson (from the GAMM)
* John Backus, Charles Katz, Alan Perlis, and Joseph Henry Wegstein (from the ACM).
The language was originally proposed to be called IAL (International Algebraic Language) but according to Perlis,
this was rejected as an &quot;&#x27;unspeakable&#x27; and pompous acronym&quot;. ALGOL was suggested instead, though not officially adopted until a year later. The publication following the meeting still used the name IAL.

By the end of 1958 the ZMMD-group had built a working ALGOL 58 compiler for the Z22 computer. ZMMD was an abbreviation for Zürich (where Rutishauser worked), München (workplace of Bauer and Samelson), Mainz (location of the Z22 computer), Darmstadt (workplace of Bottenbruch).

ALGOL 58 saw some implementation effort at IBM, but the effort was in competition with FORTRAN, and soon abandoned. It was also implemented at Dartmouth College on an LGP-30, but that implementation soon evolved into ALGOL 60. An implementation for the Burroughs 220 called BALGOL evolved along its own lines as well, but retained much of ALGOL 58&#x27;s original character.

ALGOL 58&#x27;s primary contribution was to later languages; it was used as a basis for JOVIAL, MAD, NELIAC and ALGO. It was also used during 1959 to publish algorithms in &quot;CACM&quot;, beginning a trend of using ALGOL notation in publication that continued for many years.

===Time line of implementations of ALGOL 58 variants===
==ALGOL 58&#x27;s influence on ALGOL 60==
* IAL introduced the three-level concept of reference, publication and hardware language, and the concept of &quot;word delimiters&quot; having a separate representation from freely chosen identifiers (hence, no reserved words). ALGOL 60 kept this three-level concept.
* The distinction between assignment (codice_1 representing a left-facing arrow) and the equality relation codice_2 was introduced in IAL and kept in ALGOL 60.
* Both IAL and ALGOL 60 allow arrays with arbitrary lower and upper subscript bounds, and allow subscript bounds to be defined by integer expressions.
* Both IAL and ALGOL 60 allow nesting of procedure declarations and the corresponding identifier scopes.
* The IAL report described parameter substitution in much the same terms as the ALGOL 60 report, leaving open the possibility of call by name. It is unclear if this was realized at the time.
* IAL allows numeric statement labels, that ALGOL 60 kept.
* The possibility of including non-ALGOL code within a program was already hinted at, in the context of parameters to procedures.
* Both IAL and ALGOL 60 have a &quot;switch designator&quot;, unrelated, however, to the switch statement in C and other languages.
* In-line functions of the form codice_3; were proposed in IAL but &quot;dropped&quot; in ALGOL 60.
* IAL procedure declarations provide separate declaration lists for input and output parameters, a procedure can return multiple values; this mechanism was &quot;replaced&quot; in ALGOL 60 with the value declaration.
* Variable declarations in IAL can be placed &quot;anywhere&quot; in the program and not necessarily at the beginning of a procedure. In contrast, the declarations within an ALGOL 60 block should occur &quot;before&quot; all execution statements.
* The -statement has the form codice_4, directly resembling the loop of Rutishauser&#x27;s programming language &quot;Superplan&quot;, replacing codice_2with codice_1, and replacing its German keyword codice_7 with the direct English translation codice_8; ALGOL 60 replaced the parentheses with the word delimiters codice_9 and codice_10, such that the previous statement instead would be codice_11.
* The IAL -statement does not have a -clause or -clause; it rather guards the succeeding statement. IAL provides an -statement that cleanly allows testing of multiple conditions. Both were replaced by ALGOL&#x27;s - construct, with the introduction of the &quot;dangling-&quot; ambiguity.
* IAL provides macro-substitution with the -statement; this was dropped in ALGOL 60.
* IAL allows one or more array subscripts to be omitted when passing arrays to procedures, and to provide any or all arguments to a procedure passed to another procedure.
* IAL&#x27;s infix Boolean operators are all of the same precedence level. Exponents are indicated with paired up and down arrows, which removed any confusion about the correct interpretation of nested exponents; ALGOL 60 replaced the paired arrows with a single up-arrow whose function is equivalent to FORTRAN&#x27;s **.
* The IAL report does not explicitly specify which standard functions were to be provided, making a vague reference to the &quot;standard functions of analysis.&quot; The ALGOL 60 report has a more explicit list of standard functions.

<text>Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen (3 December 1760, Giessen – 30 November 1806, Darmstadt) was a German naturalist and forester. He took part in the production of &quot;&quot; by Johann Conrad Susemihl.

He received his education in Giessen, and in 1796 started work as an assessor at the forestry office in Darmstadt. In 1800, he attained the title of &quot;Kammerrat&quot;, followed by a role as counselor at the Oberforsthaus Collegium in 1804.

As a botanist, he was the taxonomic author of Alliaceae and Asclepiadaceae as well as the circumscriber of numerous plant genera and species.

<text>John Wishart (28 November 1898 – 14 July 1956) was a Scottish mathematician and agricultural statistician.

He gave his name to the [[Wishart distribution]] in statistics.

== Life ==
Wishart was born in Perth, Scotland on 28 November 1898, the son of Elizabeth Scott and John Wishart of Montrose. His father was a bootmaker. The family moved from Montrose to Perth around 1903, living at 36 Robertsons Buildings on Barrack Street. He was educated at Perth Academy.

In the First World War he was conscripted into the Black Watch in 1917 and served two years in France.

He studied mathematics at the University of Edinburgh under Edmund Taylor Whittaker, graduating with an MA and BSc. He then went on to study at the University of Cambridge where he gained a further MA. He then gained a doctorate (DSc) at the University College London under Karl Pearson. After a year of teacher training at Moray College of Education in Edinburgh he then worked for some years as a Mathematics Teacher at West Leeds High School.

In 1927 he joined Rothamsted Experimental Station with Ronald Fisher, and then (from 1931) as a Reader in Statistics in the University of Cambridge where he became the first Director of the Statistical Laboratory in 1953. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1931, his proposers being Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Malcolm Laurie, Alexander Craig Aitken and Robert Schlapp.

He edited &quot;Biometrika&quot; from 1937. In 1950 he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He first formulated a generalised product-moment distribution named the Wishart distribution in his honour, in 1928.

In the Second World War he first served as a Captain in the Intelligence Corps then in 1942 became assistant secretary at the Admiralty.

Wishart drowned at the age of 57 in July 1956, having suffered a stroke while swimming in the sea at Revolcadero Beach, Acapulco. He was in Acapulco as a representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization, and on a mission to set up a research centre.

<text>Vettor Pisani (132413 August 1380) was a Venetian admiral.

==Career==

He was in command of the Venetian fleet in 1378 during the war against the Genoese, whom he defeated off Capo d&#x27;Anzio; subsequently he recaptured Cattaro, Sebenico and Arbe, which had been seized by the Hungarians, the allies of the Genoese. But the Genoese fleet completely defeated Pisani at Pola in May 1379, and on his return to Venice he was thrown into prison.

The Genoese then pressed home their victory, and besieged and captured Chioggia, whereby Venice itself was in danger. The people thereupon demanded the liberation of Pisani, in whose skill they had the fullest confidence.

The government gave way and appointed the aged commander admiral of the fleet once more. Through his able strategy and daring he recaptured Chioggia, defeated the Genoese and threatened Genoa itself until that republic agreed to peace terms.

Pisani died in 1380 while on his way to Manfredonia with a squadron to ship provisions. He is buried in the Basilica of San Giovanni e Paolo, Venice.

Several ships have borne his name, including &quot;Vettor Pisani&quot;, an armored cruiser built in the 1890s and the submarine &quot;Vettor Pisani&quot;, which operated during World War II.

A statue of him is #14 at the Prato della valle, Padua. His home in Venice is believed to have been in a building which is now part of the Hotel Saturnia.

<text>The 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment is a field artillery battalion assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. Carrying the lineage of Battery C, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, the battalion carries campaign streamers from World War I, World War II, and Vietnam, and has served with the 4th Infantry Division and 8th Infantry Division. The unit&#x27;s nickname is &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, and their motto is &quot;Macte Nova Virtute&quot; (Go Forth With New Strength). The battalion is composed of a headquarters and headquarters battery (HHB), three cannon batteries (Batteries A, B, and C), and has an attached Forward Support Company, Company F, 15th Brigade Support Battalion.

==History==
Constituted on 1 July 1916 in the Regular Army as Battery C, 16th Field Artillery, the unit was organized on 21 May 1917 at Camp Robinson, Wisconsin. On 19 November 1917, the 16th Field Artillery was assigned to the 4th Division. The unit was inactivated on 21 September 1921 at Camp Lewis, Washington. The 16th Field Artillery was relieved on 24 March 1923 from assignment to the 4th Division and assigned to the 8th Division.

On 13 January 1941, the battalion was reorganized and redesignated as Battery C, 16th Field Artillery Battalion. In June 1942, the battalion was again reorganized and redesignated as Battery C, 16th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, an element of the 9th Armored Division. The 16th Armored Field Artillery Battalion was activated on 10 November 1950 at Fort Hood, Texas.

On 1 July 1957, the battalion was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery.

The battalion was assigned to the 8th Infantry Division at Baumholder, Germany in the 1970s. Batteries at the time included HQ, Service, A, B, and C.

In late 1982, the entire 8-in C battery was folded into A, and B batteries to make room for the first Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) battery in Europe.

On 15 December 1995, the battalion was activated as the 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery at Fort Hood, Texas and assigned to the 4th Infantry Division.

The 16th Field Artillery Regiment has a very distinguished history. To its credit, the battalion participated in numerous campaigns during World War 1, to Include the Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, Meuse-argonne, and Champagne 1918.

During World War II, the 16th Artillery served in Rhineland, Ardennes-alsace and Central Europe. During the Vietnam War, the 16th Field Artillery is credited with participation in the Counteroffensive, Phase I, Tet Counteroffensive, Tet 69 Couteroffensive and the Sanctuary Counteroffensive. The battalion&#x27;s decorations include the Presidential Unit Citation and the Republic of Vietnam Cross-of Gallantry with Palm. Additionally, a battery was awarded the Valorous Unit Award for participation in the Quang Tin Province.

The Ivy Leaf on the battalion&#x27;s insignia represented its long standing relationship with the 4th Infantry Division. The 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery continued this relationship as the command and control headquarters for &quot;Task Force Thunder&quot;, an element of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion remained prepared to deploy anywhere in the world to synchronize and provide fires in support of sustained, decisive full spectrum operations to achieve assigned objectives.

Upon arriving at the port in Kuwait, the soldiers of the Rolling Thunder battalion went into action and downloaded all of its equipment in a record manner. Once downloaded, the equipment was moved to the staging area for forward movement to Camp Udairi, 22 km south of the Iraqi border. While at Udairi, the Thunder battalion prepared for its follow-on mission. The battalion conducted live fire weapons calibration and verified all small arms and crew served weapons systems.

The first element of the Rolling Thunder battalion to cross the Kuwait – Iraq border was B battery on 27 April 2003. The remaining elements of the battalion crossed the border of Kuwait and Iraq on 4 May 2003 at approximately 0520 hours. The battalion&#x27;s wheel convoy was provided MP escort for added security. The battalion was en route to AA Horse just south of Baghdad to marry up with its tracked vehicles. Once the battalion linked up with its equipment, the call forward order was received and the battalion continued its march to its base position at the Baqubah airfield in northern Iraq. Here, the battalion was to join the lead elements of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Warhorse Brigade. Upon arrival, the soldiers immediately begin to establish their base camp – Thunder Land.

B battery was tasked to the DIVARTY headquarters as part of Task Force Gunner. Their mission was to assist in securing the Taji Airfield. A and C batteries were further task organized to Task Force 2–8 Infantry (Talon) and Task Force 3–67 Armor (Hounds of Hell) respectively. A battery was given the mission to secure a weapons and munitions site north of the Tigris River Dam. Apache comes under hostile fire nightly. The soldiers of Cyclone were given the mission to provide direct artillery support to 3–67 Armor as it sought to secure the main MEK compound 75 km north of Baqubah. Additionally, Cyclone manned a checkpoint north of the compound in an effort to disarm freedom fighters and secure the area around the MEK compound. The Headquarters Service battery remained at Thunder Land at the Baqubah airfield, to provide logistical and administrative support to the batteries.

The locations of the batteries spread the Thunder battalion over a 100 km radius.

On 25 May 2003, C battery was released from its direct support role with Task Force 3–67 and became the primary element of Task Force Thunder. The mission of the task force was to secure and disarm the town of Balad 60 km northwest of Baqubah. Immediately, the soldiers of Task Force Thunder established and manned checkpoints to confiscate weapons. On 31 May, checkpoint 4 of C battery came under hostile enemy fire from small arms and RPGs. Injuries were minor and the soldiers fought off the attackers. On 2 June 2003, at approximately 1147 hours, the soldiers of checkpoint No. 1 came under attack from hostile forces, and the soldiers again fought valiantly and fought off their attackers. This time the injuries were much more severe and resulted in the first casualty for the Warhorse Brigade and Rolling Thunder. SGT Anatancio Haro of 3rd Howitzer section was killed while engaging the attackers. The battalion conducted a memorial service in his honor on 4 June 2003.

On 15 June 2003, C Battery and TF Thunder received a change of mission and were relieved by 3–7 Cav 3ID. C Battery and TF Thunder were ordered to reorganize and received a new mission with duty in the cities Al Husseinia, Ar Rashidiyah and Khan Bani Sad, north of Baghdad just east of the Tigris River. It was during this time that TF Thunder succeeded in creating security and stability for over 750,000 Iraqis and conducted the first CPA (Coalition Provisional Authority) sanctioned democratic elections in the Baghdad Province in December 2003. In addition to numerous civil affairs projects to help the Iraqis in the region, TF Thunder was known for being willing to use force, but being judicious in its application. This gained tremendous respect among the local Iraqis and set the conditions for no further soldiers killed in action during this deployment.

On 1 August 2004, the 4th Infantry Division (Mech) was ordered to restructure and reorganize under the U.S. Army&#x27;s concept of modularity. This would set the division to become the Army&#x27;s first fully digitized modular division. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team would lead the conversion and become the Army&#x27;s first modular Brigade Combat Team – &quot;Unit of Action&quot;. Under the restructure, the Thunder Battalion reorganized and became the first modular &quot;fires battalion&quot;. This meant the battalion would no longer be assigned to the Division Artillery but would fall under the total control of the 2 Brigade. On 1 January 2005, the Thunder Battalion completed its conversion with the activation of its support company, G Company, 204th Support Battalion. The unit&#x27;s mission was to maintain warfighting readiness and, on order, deploy by land, sea, or air to conduct combat operations by coordinating fire support that provides safe, timely, and lethal fires in support of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.

As of January 2006, OIF 05-07, the 3rd Battalion – 16th Field Artillery Regiment was deployed to Forward Operating Base Duke, located in Najaf, Iraq, as well as Forward Operating Base Kalsu and FOB Falcon in Southern Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most of the unit, along with the rest of the 2nd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division was tasked with training Iraqi Security Forces so that they can conduct operations independently of coalition troops, with the exception of 2 squads from B Battery, guns (M109A6 PALDIN) B15 and B18 who conducted live counter-fire operations in support of 1-67 Armour and 2-8 Infantry (Mechanized), both of 2nd BCT, 4ID.

<doc id="944886" wikidata="Q317583" url="?curid=944886" title="Gerald Wallace">
<text>Gerald Jermaine Wallace (born July 23, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed &quot;Crash&quot;, he was named an NBA All-Star and voted to the NBA All-Defensive First Team while with the Charlotte Bobcats in 2010. He played college basketball for the Alabama Crimson Tide.

== High school and college career ==
Wallace attended Childersburg High School in Childersburg, Alabama, where he had a very successful career. For his senior season efforts, he was named the Naismith Prep Player of the Year, an honor given to the best high school basketball player.

Wallace attended the University of Alabama for one season before declaring himself eligible for the 2001 NBA draft. Wallace was drafted in the first round as the 25th overall pick. In 2000–01, he averaged 9.8 points and 6.0 rebounds per game.

==Professional career==

===Sacramento Kings (2001–2004)===
In three seasons with the Sacramento Kings, Wallace rarely played, but in his brief appearances, he made himself known for his versatility and extraordinary athleticism. In the 2002 Slam Dunk Contest, Wallace finished second to two-time winner Jason Richardson. On December 1, 2002, Wallace led Sacramento in scoring with a then-career-high 21 points, and grabbed eight rebounds, during a 103–84 win over the Houston Rockets. During his tenure with the Kings, Wallace was the odd man out in a deep roster that included All-Stars Chris Webber, Peja Stojaković, and Vlade Divac.

===Charlotte Bobcats (2004–2011)===
Wallace was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats as part of the 2004 NBA Expansion Draft. In his first season he averaged 11.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.3 blocks a game. He continued to improve in 2005–06, before getting injured in January, averaging 14.5 points and 7 rebounds, and ranking in the top 10 in the NBA in field goal percentage (54.142), blocks (2.19), and steals per game (2.44). Since the NBA began counting blocks as a statistic in 1973, only two other players (David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) in league history have averaged over 2.0 blocks and 2.0 steals per game in a single season.

Wallace was known for his somewhat reckless style of play that led to frequent injuries and earned him the nickname &quot;Crash&quot;. He missed a total of 39 games in his first two years with the Bobcats, but his energetic and sometimes dangerous behavior that may have caused his injuries was also what contributed to his gaudy defensive stats. Coach Bernie Bickerstaff said of Wallace, &quot;Gerald can only play one way and be effective. Energy – that&#x27;s his game.&quot; In 2006, Wallace attempted to refine his game in order to avoid being injured, and as a result his numbers suffered. The first month of the season, Wallace had only five total blocks (an average of .3 per game) and his averages were down across the stat line from 2005. Wallace improved his play in the second month of the season, but he went down with a separated shoulder in a December game against the Indiana Pacers. When he returned, Wallace continued his fine play finishing the season averaging 18.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists, 2 steals, and 1 block in 72 games.
Wallace appeared opposite Tim Duncan in the March 2008 &quot;SLAM-UP&quot; centerfold for &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot;.

Wallace suffered a Grade 3 concussion on February 23, 2008, after taking an unintentional elbow to the face from Sacramento&#x27;s Mikki Moore. It was his fourth concussion in as many seasons with the Bobcats. It was not clear when he would return, although Grade 3 concussions are defined by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons as ones that &quot;involve post-traumatic amnesia for more than 24 hours or unconsciousness for more than five minutes. Players who sustain this grade of brain injury should be sidelined for at least one month, after which they can return to play if they are asymptomatic for one week.&quot; He returned later on in the season, finishing the year with a new career high in points, assists, and minutes.

He suffered a partially collapsed lung and a fractured rib after being flagrantly fouled while driving for a layup by Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; Andrew Bynum on January 27, 2009, and was forced to miss seven games. He also was unable to fly and instead crossed the United States en route back to Charlotte by bus.

Wallace was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game in Dallas, becoming the first and only Charlotte Bobcat to do so (with the Bobcats changing their name back to their original Hornets name after reclaiming the Charlotte NBA history originally owned by the Pelicans franchise in 2014). Wallace was also selected to participate in the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend Slam Dunk Contest. He was also selected to the 2010–2012 USA Basketball Men&#x27;s National Team to represent the United States in the 2010 FIBA World Championship along with a possible trip with the team to the 2012 Olympics.

In the first-ever playoff game for the Bobcats, Wallace led the team with 25 points. This franchise playoff single game scoring record lasted until game 2 of the series, when Stephen Jackson broke the record by scoring 27 points.

In 2010, Wallace was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team. During the 2010–2011 season as a Bobcat, he averaged 15.6 points per game, 8.2 rebounds per game, and 2.4 assists per game in 39 minutes per game. He played 48 games with the team during the season.

Wallace is one of three players in NBA history (the others being David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon) to average at least two steals and two blocks per game over the course of an entire season.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2011–2012)===
On February 24, 2011, Wallace was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Joel Przybilla, Dante Cunningham, Sean Marks, and two future draft picks. He provided help for the team while Brandon Roy was injured. The Trail Blazers finished 48–34, good for the playoffs. They lost in the opening round to the Dallas Mavericks in 6 games. In the next season as a Trail Blazer, Wallace averaged 13.3 points per game, 6.6 rebounds per game, and 2.7 assists per game in 35.8 minutes per game. He played 42 games with the team that season.

===New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets (2012–2013)===

On March 15, 2012, Wallace was traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Shawne Williams, Mehmet Okur and a 2012 top-3 protected 1st round draft pick (which became Damian Lillard). On April 8, 2012, Wallace injured his left leg on a put back dunk and played only two more games that season. Wallace played in 16 total games for the Nets that season and averaged 15.2 points per game. On July 11, 2012, Wallace re-signed with the Nets. The contract was reportedly worth $40 million for four years. In the first game of the season Wallace injured his left ankle. With just 27 seconds left on the game clock, Wallace got hurt trying to block a shot by Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry. After the game the team announced it was a sprained left ankle. Wallace missed six games before making his return. Wallace got injured again when the Nets played the Phoenix Suns on January 11, 2013. Wallace injured his ribs after the Phoenix Suns player P. J. Tucker fouled him hard while attempting a fast break dunk early in the first quarter. Wallace landed awkwardly on the floor and remained on the court for several moments before being helped to get on his feet and to the locker room. He did not return to the game. Wallace missed two games.

===Boston Celtics (2013–2015)===
Wallace was traded to the Boston Celtics on July 12, 2013, in a multi-player deal that sent Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry to the Nets.

On February 28, 2014, Wallace was ruled out for the rest of the season after an MRI revealed a torn meniscus in his left knee.

On July 27, 2015, Wallace was traded, along with Chris Babb, to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for David Lee. Four days later, Wallace was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, along with cash and draft considerations, in exchange for Jason Thompson. On September 27, 2015, he was waived by the 76ers.

Wallace&#x27;s final NBA game was Game 4 of the 2015 Eastern Conference First Round on April 26, 2015, against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Boston lost the game 93 – 101 with Wallace recording 1 rebound and no other stats in 3 and half minutes of playing time.

<doc id="944888" wikidata="Q1258585" url="?curid=944888" title="Alvise Vivarini">
<text>Alvise or Luigi Vivarini (1442/1453–1503/1505) was an Italian painter, the leading Venetian artist before Giovanni Bellini. Like Bellini, he was part of a dynasty of painters. His father was Antonio Vivarini and his uncle, with whom he may have trained, was Bartolomeo Vivarini. Another uncle, on his mother&#x27;s side, was the artist known as Giovanni d&#x27;Alemagna, who worked with his brother-in-law Antonio. Alvise may have trained Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari.

It has sometimes been supposed that, besides the Luigi who was the latest of this pictorial family, there had also been another Luigi who was the earliest (i.e. Antonio&#x27;s father), this supposition being founded on the fact that one picture is signed with the name, with the date 1414. There is good ground, however, for considering this date to be a forgery of a later time.

The works of Vivarini show an advance on those of his predecessors, and some of them are productions of high attainment; one of the best was executed for the Scuola di San Girolamo in Venice, representing the saint caressing his lion, and some monks decamping in terror. The architecture and perspective in this work are superior.

Many churches in Venice have examples. Other works by Vivarini are in Treviso, Milan and the National Gallery, London. He painted some remarkable portraits.

The &quot;Adoration of Christ&quot; dated 1476, in the sacristy of the church of Montefiorentino, is one of his early productions. In 1480 he painted a &quot;Virgin and Saints&quot; for San Francesco, Treviso, now in the Venice Accademia. To about this date belong the &quot;SS. Matthew and John the Baptist&quot;, in the same collection; and the fresco of &quot;Christ Carrying His Cross&quot; in Santi Giovanni e Paolo. In 1488, Alvise Vivarini wrote a letter to the Signory of Venice, requesting permission to share with Bellini in the commission to decorate the Hall of Great Council in the Doge&#x27;s Palace. To this he received a favorable reply, and thereupon executed two paintings, which were burned in the fire of 1577. The subjects, Vasari tells us, were &quot;Otho promising to mediate between Venice and Barbarossa&quot; and &quot;Barbarossa receiving his Son&quot;. The Council were so pleased with the pictures that, in 1492, Alvise was named &quot;Depentor in Gran Conseio&quot;, with a salary of five ducats a month. Notwithstanding this work for the State, he continued to paint altar-pieces for private patrons. The &quot;Apotheosis of St. Ambrose&quot; (1503) in the Cappella Milimesi of the Frari, Venice, was probably the last production of Alvise, as the inscription tells us that it was completed after his death by Marco Basaiti, one of his pupils.

<text>Dresdner Bank AG () was a German bank, founded in 1872 in Dresden, then headquartered in Berlin from 1884 to 1945 and in Frankfurt from 1963 onwards after a postwar hiatus. Long Germany&#x27;s second-largest bank behind Deutsche Bank, it was eventually acquired by Commerzbank in May 2009.

==1872-1933==
The Dresdner Bank was established on through the conversion of , a Dresden-based private bank founded in 1771, on the advice of banker Eugen Gutmann. The bank&#x27;s founding consortium of investors consisted of (Leipzig), Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft (Berlin), (Frankfurt), (Frankfurt) and (Hamburg), with an initial capital of 8 million Thalers (24 million Marks) and 30 employees in Wilsdruffer Strasse in Dresden. Gutmann became chairman of the new entity&#x27;s board and led it until his retirement in 1920.

In the 1870s, the Dresdner Bank acquired smaller regional institutes and several banks. In 1881, it opened a branch in Berlin, whose activity quickly exceeded the nominal head office in Dresden. Therefore, the registered office moved to Berlin in 1884, while the place of jurisdiction remained in Dresden until 1950. In 1889, together with Deutsche Bank and others, the Dresdner Bank participated in the creation of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai, and in 1894 of Banca Commerciale Italiana in Milan. It also developed its own overseas-oriented network by opening branches in Hamburg (1892, when it absorbed the Anglo-Deutsche Bank), Bremen (1895), and London (1901).

In 1905 Dresdner formed a close alliance with J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. of New York, for joint action in international finance and issue operations, particularly the absorption of American securities by German investors. Operations in the orient and South America were carried on jointly in cooperation with the A. Schaaffhausen&#x27;scher Bankverein, including the establishment in 1905 of Deutsche Orientbank which also involved the Nationalbank für Deutschland. 

By end-1908, Dresdner Bank was the second-largest German joint-stock bank by total deposits, with a total of 225 million Marks surpassed only by Deutsche Bank (489 million) and well ahead of Disconto-Gesellschaft (219 million) and Darmstädter Bank (109 million). At that time, Dresdner Bank was referred to as one of the four &quot;D-Banks&quot; (all of which had names starting with a D) that dominated German commercial banking, together with Darmstädter Bank, Deutsche Bank, and Disconto-Gesellschaft.

During the First World War, the London branch was forced to close; however, the branch network itself expanded.

By 1930, Dresdner Bank was Germany&#x27;s third-largest joint-stock bank by total deposits with 2.3 billion Reichsmarks, behind Deutsche Bank und Disconto-Gesellschaft (4.8 billion) and Danat-Bank (2.4 billion), and ahead of Commerz- und Privatbank (1.5 billion), Reichs-Kredit-Gesellschaft (619 million), and Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft (412 million).

As a consequence of state intervention during the banking crisis of 1931, the German Reich owned 66% and Deutsche Golddiskontbank owned 22% of Dresdner Bank shares; the total government stake in Dresdner Bank reached 97 percent, and (unlike at Deutsche Bank) resulted in significant interference in the bank&#x27;s management. As part of the same restructuring, Dresdner Bank acquired full ownership of the former Danat-Bank, of Mercurbank in Vienna, and of Deutsche Orientbank in Istanbul. Its deputy director was Hjalmar Schacht, soon-to-be Minister of Economy under Nazism. 

==Nazi era==

Following Adolf Hitler&#x27;s assumption of power in 1933, the Dresdner Bank, which had been founded by a Jewish banker, Eugen Gutmann, fired all 600 Jewish employees, including board members as well as bank clerks, and cancelled or confiscated their pensions. In May of 1933, &quot;Nazi brownshirts swarmed into the lobby of the Dresdner headquarters and smashed the bronze bust of Eugen to the ground.&quot; The bank was declared &quot;Judenrein&#x27; (&quot;cleansed&quot; of Jews) and became a tool of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi regime.

The &quot;Aryanized&quot; bank fully participated in the Nazi regime&#x27;s aryanization of Jewish businesses and became known as the bank of choice for Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s SS. As with other banks that had been nationalized to various degrees in 1931, Dresdner Bank was reprivatised in stages in 1936-1937.

After the Nazi Anschluss in 1938, Dresdner Bank on acquired ownership of Vienna-based Länderbank through its local subsidiary the Mercurbank, in a transaction forced under duress. The Prague-based Živnostenská Banka&#x27;s Austrian subsidiary was simultaneously subsumed in the merged entity, renamed . The new Länderbank had 33 branch offices in Vienna (36 after acquisition of the Austrian business of in 1939), in comparison to 24 for the rival Creditanstalt-Bankverein that had come under control of Deutsche Bank. 

Later in 1938 following the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland, Dresdner Bank, through , took over the former branches of the Böhmische Escompte-Bank in the South Moravian towns of Břeclav (), Mikulov () and Znojmo (). In subsequent years, most of the Länderbank&#x27;s resources were used to finance the Nazi war effort, while in March 1939, Dresdner Bank acquired control of Böhmische Escompte-Bank. 

During World War II, Dresdner Bank took over the Böhmische Escompte-Bank in Prague, the Societatea Bancară Română in Bucharest, the Handels- und Kreditbank in Riga, and the Kontinentale Bank in Brussels. It also maintained majority control of the Kommerzialbank in Kraków, Deutsche Handels- und Kreditbank in Bratislava, Banque Bulgare de Commerce in Sofia, and founded the Handelstrust West N. V. in Amsterdam. Following the invasion of Yugoslavia and proclamation of the Independent State of Croatia, Dresdner Bank took a 53 percent stake in Jugoslavenska Banka, renamed by court order of . Also in 1941, Dresdner Bank took over management control of the Bank of Athens during the Axis occupation of Greece, without however taking ownership out of consideration for Italian sensitivities. In September 1941, Dresdner Bank appropriated a block of shares owned by , an affiliate of the French Schneider-Creusot group, in the Hungarian General Credit Bank. 

Dresdner Bank helped to finance concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The bank was closely involved in the occupation of Europe, &quot;essentially acting as the bank of the SS in Poland&quot;.

As a result of World War II 80% of the bank&#x27;s buildings were destroyed, costing the bank 162 offices in 56 locations.

==1945-2002==


Following the end of World War II in Europe, the chairman of the bank&#x27;s supervisory board, , was arrested by the American occupation forces and held in custody until late 1947. Karl Rasche, the bank&#x27;s former chief executive () since 1942, was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to seven years&#x27; imprisonment. The Deutsche Orientbank, Dresdner Bank&#x27;s Turkish subsidiary, was liquidated in 1946.

On 30 July 1977 in Oberursel (Taunus), Jürgen Ponto, the chairman of the board of directors of Dresdner Bank, was shot in his home during an attempted kidnapping by the RAF. Ponto later died from his injuries.

Dresdner Bank expanded its network with acquisition and opening new offices not only in Europe but also in the United States, Singapore, Canada, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and China. Dresdner Bank was the first to open its own office in former eastern Germany in Dresden on 2 January 1990. After the acquisition of Kleinwort Benson in 1995 to form its investment-banking arm Dresdner Kleinwort, Dresdner Bank took over the American investment bank Wasserstein Perella Group Inc., New York in 2000. This investment banking unit was then renamed Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.

In 1999, Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) proposed a merger but Allianz, a major shareholder of Dresdner Bank, opposed the merger. AXA, a major shareholder in BNP, is a rival of Allianz.

==Takeover by Allianz==

In 2002 Dresdner Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance corporation Allianz. In July 2006 Dresdner Kleinwort, dropped Wasserstein from their name and went through a re-organization of corporate bank, capital markets and investment bank. The arm made up of capital markets and investment banking.

In 2008 it was reported that Allianz was looking to dispose of Dresdner Bank. British banking group Lloyds TSB were amongst those rumoured to be interested. However, by July that year Lloyds TSB had denied any interest in making a bid.

==Takeover by Commerzbank==

On August 31, 2008, Commerzbank announced that it would acquire Dresdner Bank for EUR 9.8 billion. Dresdner Bank was legally merged with Commerzbank on 11 May 2009 and ceased to be an independent entity.

In 2009, Deutsche Bank announced it will integrate the Dresdner Agency Security Lending business into its trust and securities services (TSS) business in global transaction banking (GTB).

Dresdner Bank attempted to get a banking operating license in Saint Petersburg, where former KGB agent Vladimir Putin was in charge of foreign economic relations. Dresdner Bank appointed Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi agent and Vladimir Putin&#x27;s former KGB contact, to negotiate with Putin. The office was opened in 1991. Warnig became chairman of the board of directors of Dresdner Bank ZAO, Dresdner Bank Russian subsidiary which was located in the massive former German embassy on St. Isaac&#x27;s Square and was a joint venture with Banque nationale de Paris (BNP).

The bank has had a lucrative business relationship with Gazprom and the state oil company Rosneft. The bank advised on the forced sale of Yukos assets.

In 2017, Frankfurt prosecutors, together with federal crime police and tax officials, conducted searches of Commerzbank offices as well as the flats of three suspects in Frankfurt and nearby Hanau about a &quot;tax evasion probe in which several current and former managers are suspected of evading 40 million euros ($47 million) in taxes via dividend stripping, also known as &quot;cum-ex&quot; transactions&quot;. The investigation also extends to trades in 2008 at Dresdner Bank, which was taken over by Commerzbank in 2009.

<doc id="944906" wikidata="Q6002286" url="?curid=944906" title="Image server">
<text>An image server is web server software which specializes in delivering (and often modifying) images. However, not all image servers support HTTP or can be used on web sites.

While traditional web servers generally supply clients with static copies of image files, image servers usually perform additional image processing before serving the file. These functions may include frame/format selection, resizing, cropping, alpha blending, compositing source images, rotating, color adjustment, and filtering.

A major use of image servers is to support browser-based pan-and-zoom viewers. port/1188

== Concepts ==

=== Single-source imaging ===
The proliferation of mobile devices, screen resolutions, and pixel densities has forced web designers to create an ever-increasing number of image variations.
Image servers capable of dynamic image resizing can produce the required sizes and variations on demand, eliminating repetitive work and the room for human error.

=== Declarative vs imperative ===
Declarative APIs (such as RIAPI) allow the client to describe resulting characteristics of the image, such as desired size, aspect ratio, rotation, fit modes, etc. Command order is not important - ?width=200&amp;height=100 will produce the same result as ?height=100&amp;width=200. The server is free to coalesce compatible operations to improve performance.

Imperative APIs, (such as IIP or IIIF) describe the operations to apply to the image in order, offering the user more control, but also more responsibility for calculations.

== Uses ==

=== Dynamic tile-based delivery ===

Browser-based viewers for high resolution images enable a responsive pan and zoom experience by requesting small tiles (typically square JPEGs or PNGs at 256x256 or 512x512 pixels) generated from the high resolution source. Only those tiles required to render the user&#x27;s current viewport and zoom level are loaded, with more requested on demand as the user zooms in to particular areas. This tile generation can be done in advance and stored on the server file system as an Image Pyramid. However, this results in potentially thousands of small JPEG files with associated storage and management overhead. An Image server can respond dynamically to HTTP requests for the tiles, generating HTTP responses (the tile images) on the fly. The server requires only the single high resolution source image.

=== E-commerce ===

The simplest product viewers usually require at least 3 versions of an image: a 100x100 thumbnail, a 400x300 medium &#x27;in-page, selected&#x27;, and a 1200x900 &#x27;zoomed&#x27; version. Combined with the original file, this results in 4 separate images that must be stored, updated, and linked to.

In e-commerce, image servers are qualified by their abilities to scale to hundreds of thousands of images, to multiple CPUs or load-balanced server machines, and to the quantity and quality of their image processing functionalities, such as resizing, compositing, zoom and 3D viewers, and the addition of dynamic data to the images in the form of overlaid text or graphics.

Dynamic compositing is also extremely useful for merchants who permit product customization. Many vehicle manufacturers use dynamic compositing to let the visitor visualize their customizations.

=== Large image sets, mapping, and geospatial use ===
Geospatial or mapping has particular need for specialized &quot;image servers&quot;. Aerial and satellite images are georeferenced and can be hundreds or thousands of gigabytes in size. Traditional mechanisms for serving this data have proved inadequate. The first specialized image server for geospatial image data was Image Web Server, released in 1999. Image Web Server, among other protocols, supports ECWP (ERDAS Compressed Wavelet Protocol) that &quot;streams&quot; large images to a user&#x27;s application, rather than sending a regular image over HTTP. The well known standard for a distributed architecture of geospatial data is Web Map Service.

=== Responsive web design &amp; mobile support ===
Responsive web design has driven the creation of dozens of new image servers which often integrate device or resolution detection.

To prevent resampling artifacts, it&#x27;s important that images display at native resolution - one image pixel per device display pixel.

To accomplish this, a large number of variations must be created for each screen resolution. An image server can solve that by dynamically adjusting the size of the image according to the user&#x27;s browser settings.

=== Backwards compatibility ===
Old versions of Internet Explorer have trouble displaying PNG and MNG images, but an image server could detect the user&#x27;s browser version and send the image in a supported format such as GIF instead.

Image servers may enable early adopters to begin using WebP before all browsers implement support.

== Standards and specifications ==
* RESTful Image API (RIAPI) - 2012 - Draft specification for a simple, declarative, querystring-based image API. Browser-compatible.
* Internet Imaging Protocol (IIP) - 1997 - (optionally) HTTP-based imperative protocol for image editing; heavily tied to the FlashPix file format. Authored by the International Imaging Industry Association
* ECWP (ERDAS Compressed Wavelet Protocol)
* Web Map Service

<doc id="944920" wikidata="Q3183505" url="?curid=944920" title="Jonathan Z. Smith">
<text>Jonathan Zittell Smith (November 21, 1938 – December 30, 2017), also known as J. Z. Smith, was an American historian of religions. He was based at the University of Chicago for most of his career. His research included work on such diverse topics as Christian origins, the theory of ritual, Hellenistic religions, Māori cults in the 19th century, and the mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana, as well as methodological studies on such common scholarly tools as description, comparison, and interpretation. An essayist, his works include &quot;Map Is Not Territory, Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown,&quot; &quot;To Take Place: Toward Theory in Ritual,&quot; &quot;Drudgery Divine: On the Comparison of Early Christianities and the Religions of Late Antiquity,&quot; &quot;Relating Religion: Essays in the Study of Religion,&quot; and a collection of his writings on pedagogy, &quot;On Teaching Religion&quot;.

==Life and career==
Smith was born on November 21, 1938, in Brooklyn, New York City, and grew up in Manhattan. As a teenager, he desired to become an agrostologist. He graduated from Haverford College in 1960 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy. He also earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale Divinity School and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in the history of religions from Yale University in 1969, where he was their first degree candidate in this field; with a thesis on anthropological thought, focused on Sir James George Frazer, &quot;The Glory, Jest and Riddle: James George Frazer and The Golden Bough&quot;. After holding positions at Dartmouth College and UC Santa Barbara, he began teaching at the University of Chicago, where he served as Dean of the College from 1977 to 1982 and was appointed Robert O. Anderson Distinguished Service Professor of the Humanities. He still held that position , and remained active in undergraduate teaching at least as recently as the autumn quarter 2011, teaching the course titled &quot;Introduction to Religious Studies&quot;. He was elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2000, and served as president of the Society of Biblical Literature in 2008.

While at the College of the University of Chicago Smith also wrote on pedagogy and the reform of undergraduate education in the United States. This emphasis on teaching also affected Smith&#x27;s output in another way—up until that point, much of his written work began as lectures, and most of his publications were essays. Smith&#x27;s research focused on Western theories of difference ranging from contemporary accounts of alien abduction to Greek and Roman ideas about the way climate shapes human character.

Smith never used a computer. He typed or hand-wrote all of his papers. Furthermore, he despised the telephone and thought the cell phone was &quot;an absolute abomination.&quot;

Smith died of lung cancer on December 30, 2017. He was survived by his wife Elaine, daughter Siobhan, and son Jason. After the news of Smith&#x27;s death was announced, scholars of religion soon began more explicitly to reflect on the effects of his writings and work. The blog of the UK-based quarterly, &quot;Bulletin for the Study of Religion&quot; began an ongoing series of posts, from international scholars, concerning what they understood themselves to have learned from Smith.

== Comparison of religions ==
Intellectually, Smith was influenced by neo-Kantian thinkers, especially Ernst Cassirer and Émile Durkheim. He was also influenced by Claude Lévi-Strauss. Smith&#x27;s dissertation focused on James Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; and the method that Frazer used in the comparison of different religions. Later, much of Smith&#x27;s work focused on the problem of comparison and how best to compare data taken from societies that are very different from one another. His most influential essay on this topic is perhaps &quot;In Comparison a Magic Dwells&quot;.

<text>Slow River is a science fiction novel by British writer Nicola Griffith, first published in 1995. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel and the Lambda Literary Award. The novel received critical praise for its writing and setting, while its use of multiple narrative modes was criticised.

==Summary==

The novel features three narrative strands. The first in the internal chronology tells of Lore Van Oesterling, the scion of a rich and powerful family, being trained for a high-ranking position in its industry of genetically modified bacteria. Lore has to contend with her abusive family members at the same time. In the second, Lore is kidnapped, and her family refuses to ransom her. After an escape attempt, she turns to making a living from sex shows and scamming the wealthy, in the company of a woman, Spanner, who gives her shelter. In the final thread, Lore separates from Spanner and works in a sewage treatment plant, before eventually confronting her family.

==Reception==
The novel was first published in 1995. It won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1997, and the Lambda Literary Award in 1996. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; directed praise at Griffith&#x27;s setting, writing that her &quot;grim near-future&quot; was convincing. Describing the book as an &quot;explicitly lesbian drama&quot;, the review added that Griffith wrote with &quot;skill and charm&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was critical of the switches between first- and third-person narratives, noting that it was &quot;refreshing at first&quot;, but led to increasing confusion: this criticism was echoed by &quot;Kirkus&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; added that the viewpoint switches were Griffith&#x27;s &quot;only miss-step&quot;, and that the novel was &quot;exceptionally well-written&quot;. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; wrote that the plot was &quot;humane but at times contorted&quot;, and noted the depth in which Griffith explored her fictional near-future setting.

Scholar Pia Møller described the book as both a thriller and a romance, and noted that this may have led to it receiving less attention from critics, particularly as Griffith may have &quot;compromised character development for suspense&quot;. Møller noted that the book&#x27;s status as a lesbian romance, in particular, may have led to it being marginalised. She added that the story featured a &quot;sophisticated depiction of environmental management&quot;, and praised Griffith for writing a book that made sociological themes accessible to a wide audience.

<text>The Red Angus is an international breed of beef cattle characterised by a reddish-brown coat colour. It derives from the Scottish Aberdeen Angus population and is identical to it in all but coat colour. Red Angus are registered separately from black Angus cattle in Australia, Canada, and the United States.

== History ==

The Scottish Angus is usually black, but red individuals occur; this may be the consequence of cross-breeding in the eighteenth century of the small Scottish cattle with larger English Longhorn stock, aimed at increasing their draught power.

In the United States, these red individuals could until 1917 be registered in the herdbook of the American Angus Association. From about 1945, some herds consisting only of red-coated stock were formed. In 1954 a breeders&#x27; association, the Red Angus Association of America, was established at a meeting in Fort Worth, Texas. The registered population in 2008 numbered about head, making it the fifth beef breed by number in the United States; American Angus, Charolais, Hereford and Simmental were more numerous.

In Australia, breeders of the red variant proposed a scheme for registration of their stock with the Angus Society of Australia; it was not accepted, and in 1970 they formed the Red Angus Society of Australia. 

The Red Angus is reported to DAD-IS by Australia, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Slovenia and the United States; its global conservation status is &quot;not at risk&quot;.

== Use ==

The Red Angus is a beef breed, and is reared only for that purpose. Comparative trials have not identified any commerciallysignificant difference between it and the American Angus. Bulls have been used as sires for crossbreeding. The Red Angus is a parent breed to the Regus (cross-breeding with Hereford) and to the RX3 (a mixture of Hereford, Red Angus and Red Holstein).

<text>The Challenge 1932 was the third FAI International Tourist Plane Competition (), that took place between 12 and August 28, 1932, in Berlin, Germany. The four Challenges, from 1929 to 1934, were major aviation events in pre-war Europe.

==Overview==
Germany organized the contest, because German pilot Fritz Morzik won the previous Challenge in 1930. The number of aircraft that took part in the 1932 Challenge was smaller - 43 compared to 60, because the contest was getting much more difficult with time, demanding high pilotage skills and more advanced aircraft. This time, most countries developed new aircraft specifically for the Challenge. There were 67 entries reported, but as much as 24 aircraft did not show up, partly because of unfinished development or crashes during tests.

Teams from six countries entered the Challenge in 1932: Germany (16 crews), France (8 crews), Italy (8 crews), Poland (5 crews), Czechoslovakia (4 crews) and Switzerland (2 crews). English aviator Winifred Spooner entered the contest in the Italian team, being the only woman among the pilots. One Canadian (John Carberry) and one Romanian pilot (Alexander Papana) entered the contest in the German team.

The opening ceremony was on August 12, 1932, at Berlin-Staaken airfield. The contest consisted of three parts: technical trials, a rally around Europe and a maximum speed test. Since one of the aims of the Challenge was to stimulate progress in aircraft development, it was not only pilots&#x27; competition, but technical trials also included a construction evaluation that promoted more advanced designs.

==Aircraft==
The Challenge was to be a contest of tourist aircraft, so competing aircraft had to be able to take at least two persons aboard, take off and land on a short field and cover a distance with a good cruising speed. In fact, Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Italy developed modern sports aircraft specifically to meet the demands of the Challenge. Before the contest, a favourite was German Messerschmitt&#x27;s BFW M.29, offering the highest performance, but due to two crashes during training, all BFWs were withdrawn. Their place as German favourites was taken by six fast Heinkel He 64s. Most numerous German aircraft was the three-seater Klemm Kl 32 (7 plus one in Swiss team). Both were wooden low-wing monoplanes. Italy and Czechoslovakia developed similar strutted low-wing monoplanes, the Breda Ba.33 and Praga BH-111. Poland developed a high-wing RWD-6 and an all-metal low-wing monoplane PZL.19. All these aircraft had enclosed crew cabins, fixed landing gear and advanced wing mechanization (flaps and slat). The other aircraft, especially French, modified from serial designs, were less modern and had lower chances in technical trials.

Aircraft participating were: Klemm Kl 32 (8), Breda Ba.33 (8), Heinkel He 64 (6), Praga BH-111 (3), PZL.19 (3), RWD-6 (2), Potez 43 (2), Farman 234 (2), Farman 353 (1), Darmstadt D-22a (1), Raab-Katzenstein RK-25/32 (1), Breda Ba.15S (1), Monocoupe 110 (1), Guerchais T.9 (1), Caudron C.278 (1), Mauboussin M.112 (1), Comte AC-12 (1).

The German aircraft had starting numbers from a range: A4-A9, B1-B9, C2-C8, E1-E2, French: K1-K8, Italian: M1-M8, Polish: O1-O6, Swiss: S1-S2, Czechoslovak: T1-T4 (numbers were placed on fuselages in a black square frame).

==Technical trials==
On August 13 the technical evaluation of the competing planes&#x27; construction took place. Since it was a tourist plane contest, features such as: a comfortable cabin with a good view, seats placed side-by-side, a rich set of controls, modern construction, safety devices and folding wings were also awarded points. Most points were given to the Polish designs (86 points to the RWD-6 and 84 points to the PZL.19), behind them the Italian Breda Ba.33 (83 points) and Praga BH-111 (80 points). This gave them more than ten points&#x27; advantage over most feared German designs (Kl 32 - 71-72 points, He 64c - 66 points), and placed them as favourites from this point. Worst planes scored 44 points (Caudron C.278 biplane and Mauboussin M.12).

The first trial was a minimal speed trial, to evaluate the aircraft safety, which was new in &quot;Challenge&quot; contests. Flying on the edge of stalling, Franciszek Żwirko was the slowest with 57.6 km/h speed, the second was another Pole flying an RWD-6, Tadeusz Karpiński. Behind them were the Italians, the German He 64s and the French Raymond Delmotte (C.278) with good results ranging from 61.2 to 65.7 km/h, and then the rest. The regulations did not expect such low speeds and therefore all seven results below 63 km/h were awarded with 50 points.

Next there were trials of a short take off and landing, carried out in groups until 17 August 1932. The short take-off trial required the crews to fly over an 8-m high gate. The German pilot Wolfram Hirth (Kl 32) was the best, taking off from the closest distance (91.6m - 40 pts), two Italians Colombo and Lombardi scored 40 points as well, other Klemms and Bredas were also at the head. Polish RWD-6s scored 37 points (111.5 and 115 m).

Next, a short landing trial followed, from behind an 8 m high gate. The best result, 92.4 m (40 pts), was achieved by Winifred Spooner. Good results were scored by Klemms, Bredas, RWD-6s and French Potez 43s. After the technical evaluation and these two trials, the leaders in the general classification were: the Italian Ambrogio Colombo and the Pole Franciszek Żwirko on the RWD-6. The next places were taken by an Italian team, then by the Germans and Poles, then the rest.

August 16 saw a trial of quick folding of wings, which was a feature to save place in hangars, and then a trial of quick engine starting. The general classification changed little after these trials, with Żwirko and Colombo holding on to a joint lead with 222 points each.

A fuel consumption trial on a 300 km distance was held on August 19, and the German aircraft won in that category. After all technical trials, Ambrogio Colombo led the general classification, with Franciszek Żwirko second, Italy&#x27;s Francesco Lombardi third.

Before the next part, Winifred Spooner was forced to land near Berlin due to sabotage of her fuel, and she decided to withdraw.

==Rally over Europe==

The second part of the Challenge was a 7363 km rally over Europe, on a path: Berlin - Warsaw - Kraków - Prague - Brno – Vienna - Zagreb - &quot;Postumia&quot; (checkpoint) - Vicenza - Rimini - Rome - Florence - Bellinzona - Torino – &quot;Albenga&quot; (checkpoint) – &quot;Imperia&quot; (checkpoint) - Cannes - Lyon - St. Gallen - Stuttgart - Bonn - Paris - Deauville – Rotterdam - Dortmund – Hamburg - Copenhagen – &quot;Laholm&quot; (checkpoint) - Gothenburg - Laholm (checkpoint) - Copenhagen - Hamburg – Berlin. 39 aircraft took part in the race. Main waypoints were Rome and Paris. Longest section was Berlin – Warsaw (518 km), the shortest - Brno – Vienna (106.4 km).

The rally started on August 21. From the beginning, the German crews tried to take advantage of faster aircraft and make up for the points lost in the technical trials. The Italians tried to be the first in Rome, racing against the Germans. On the other side, the Poles, with slower planes, tried to keep a good cruise speed and flight regularity, which were awarded with points in the rally. On the first day, most crews reached Vienna or Zagreb, while the Italians reached Vicenza. Ambrogio Colombo and three Germans (von Massenbach, Seidemann and Marienfeld) got as far as Rimini. Three crews withdrew on the way due to breakdowns.
On August 22, the competitors landed in Rome, but the German pilot Hans Seidemann was first. Only 33 crews reached Rome, three had forced crash landings (among others, the Romanian Aleksander Papana flying Monocoupe 110).

On August 23, the competitors took off from Rome. On that day, two Italian Bredas crashed due to weak wing construction (one mechanic died bailing out). As a result, Italy decided to withdraw all the Italian teams from the Challenge, Ambrogio Colombo being the leader by then. On August 24, the 25 remaining crews reached Paris. On August 27, the competitors finished in Berlin. The first pilot in Berlin, and the fastest in the whole race, was the German Hans Seidemann with a cruise speed of 213 km/h, flying the Heinkel He 64b. The next seven results were also German. Franciszek Żwirko arrived in 11th place, with a cruise speed of 191 km/h.
After the technical trials and the rally, Franciszek Żwirko held first place in the general classification with 456 points, with Reinhold Poss in second with 451 pts, Wolf Hirth in third with 450 pts and Robert Fretz (Suiss) in fourth with 448 pts. Fritz Morzik was fifth with 444 pts.

==Maximum speed trial==
The last part of the Challenge was a maximum speed trial, on a 300 km triangular course. The beginning and landing was on August 28 at the Berlin-Staaken airfield.

The fastest was the German Fritz Morzik (He 64c) with 241.3 km/h. The next four places were also occupied by Heinkels. Żwirko&#x27;s closest rival, Reinhold Poss flying a Klemm Kl 32, was in 7th position (220.7 km/h). The fastest Pole was Tadeusz Karpiński (8th position, 216.2 km/h, RWD-6), while Franciszek Żwirko took the 13th position with 214.1 km/h.

Due to a handicapping system, contestants took off in order of general classification, with proper intervals, and a number of points given in the speed trial meant that the first on the finish line would be the winner of all contest. As a result, minutes could decide the final victory in the Challenge. Taking off 12 minutes after Żwirko, Morzik landed 83 seconds after him - if he had overrun Żwirko, he would have won. Poss, starting five minutes after the leader, was 2 minutes 30 seconds short.

==Results==
A closing ceremony was held after the maximum speed test on August 28. The winners were the Polish crew: pilot Franciszek Żwirko and mechanic Stanisław Wigura, with 461 points. Their success was not only a result of their aviation skills, but also of the technical features of their Polish-designed RWD-6 (which Wigura had co-designed). Due to Żwirko&#x27;s victory, the next Challenge 1934 was organized in Warsaw.

The second and third place was occupied jointly by Germans: Fritz Morzik (Heinkel He 64c, the winner of the Challenge 1930) and Reinhold Poss (Klemm Kl 32V) with 458 points. The 5th place was taken by Switzerland&#x27;s Robert Frenz flying German Klemm Kl 32. Tadeusz Karpiński flying the other RWD-6, took the 9th place. The best Czech, Josef Kalla, took 16th place, the best French contestant, Raymond Delmotte - 20th place. The Challenge was completed by only 24 crews out of 43 (12 German, 4 Polish, 4 French, 3 Czechoslovak and 1 Swiss).

The first prize in the Challenge was 100,000 French franc, the 2nd - 50,000 FRF, the 3rd - 25,000 FRF, the 4th - 13,000 FRF, 16 other crews would get 7,000 FRF.

Less than a month after the Challenge, Franciszek Zwirko and Stanislaw Wigura died in an accident, flying their RWD-6 to Czechoslovakia in a storm on September 11, 1932. Reinhold Poss also died in an accident in 1933. Winifred Spooner died the same year.

<text>Arabic, particularly the Algerian Arabic dialect, is the most widely spoken language in Algeria, but a number of regional and foreign languages are also spoken. The official languages of Algeria are Arabic and Berber, as specified in its constitution since 1963 for the former and since 2016 for the latter. Berber has been recognized as a &quot;national language&quot; by constitutional amendment since 8 May 2002. In February 2016, a constitutional resolution was passed making Berber an official language alongside Arabic. Arabic is spoken by about 81% of Algerians, while Berber languages are spoken by 27%. French, though it has no official status, is still used in media (some newspapers) and education due to Algeria&#x27;s colonial history. Kabyle, with 3 million speakers, is the most spoken Berber language in the country, is taught and partially co-official (with a few restrictions) in parts of Kabylie.

The 1966 Algerian census, the last to include a question about the mother tongue, showed that 81.5% of the population spoke Arabic as a native language, with about half of the Berber population also speaking it as a second language, while 17.9% spoke Berber languages natively.

Malika Rebai Maamri, author of &quot;The Syndrome of the French Language in Algeria,&quot; said &quot;The language spoken at home and in the street remains a mixture of Algerian dialect and French words.&quot; Due to the number of languages and complexity involving those languages, Maamri argued that &quot;[t]oday the linguistic situation in Algeria is dominated by multiple discourses and positions.&quot;

==Currently spoken languages==

===Arabic===
According to Canadian ethnolinguist (*1943), 72% of Algerians in 2008 spoke Arabic: 60% spoke Algerian Arabic (83% of Arabic speakers); 11.3% of Arabic speakers spoke Hassaniyya; 0.4% spoke Moroccan Arabic; 0.1% spoke Saharan Arabic; a smaller number spoke Egyptian Arabic or Iraqi Arabic. Non-native speakers learn Literary Arabic at school, and as such a relative majority of the population understands Standard Arabic or the Algerian Arabic dialect. Algerian Arabic (or &quot;derja&quot;) is spoken by 60% of the total population (83% of Arab speakers).

The 1963 constitution of Algeria made Arabic the official language, and this was retained in the 1976 constitution. The 1976 constitution states in Article 3 &quot;Arabic is the national and official language&quot;. Neither constitution mentions Berber. The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) stated &quot;Arabic was chosen at the outset as the language which was to represent Algeria’s identity and religion, and official attitudes towards both Berber and French have been largely negative.&quot; The PCGN stated that French, not Arabic, is the actual lingua franca of Algeria. Arabic is not commonly used in the Kabylie region.

In Algeria, as elsewhere, spoken Arabic differs very substantially from written Arabic; Algerian Arabic has a much-simplified vowel system, a substantially changed vocabulary and does not have the case endings of the written Arabic. Algerian Arabic does not necessarily stem from written Arabic. Within Algerian Arabic itself, there are significant local variations; Jijel Arabic, in particular, is noteworthy for its pronunciation of &quot;qaf&quot; as &quot;kaf&quot; and its profusion of Berber loanwords, and the dialects of some ports show influence from Andalusi Arabic brought by refugees from al-Andalus. Algerian Arabic is part of the Maghrebi Arabic dialect continuum, and fades into Moroccan Arabic and Tunisian Arabic along the respective borders.

In the Sahara, more conservative Bedouin dialects, grouped under the name Saharan Arabic, are spoken; in addition, the many Sahrawi refugees at Tindouf speak Hassaniya Arabic. Most Jews of Algeria once spoke dialects of Arabic specific to their community, collectively termed Judeo-Arabic.

After Algeria became independent in 1962, it tried to improve fluency by importing Arabic teachers from Egypt and Syria. Martin Regg Cohn of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; said that many of the instructors were unqualified. In 1963, of the 1,300,000 literate people in Algeria, an estimate of 300,000 read literary Arabic. Mohamed Benrabah, author of &quot;Language maintenance and spread: French in Algeria,&quot; said that during that year, &quot;linguistic competence in Standard Arabic was relatively low.&quot; Malika Rebai Maamri, author of &quot;The Syndrome of the French Language in Algeria,&quot; said that as of 2009, &quot;classical Arabic is still not mastered even at higher educational levels&quot; and that &quot;dialectical Arabic cannot express things in writing.&quot;

As of 2012, remaining generations educated under the French colonial system are unable to read or write Arabic.

===Berber===

The Berber languages are considered the native language of Algeria since antiquity. They are spoken in five major dialects in many parts of the territory, but mainly in Kabylia, in the Awras, and in the Algerian Sahara desert (by Algerian Tuaregs).

Before, during and after Phoenician settlers&#x27; arrival, Berber remained spoken throughout ancient Algeria (Numidia), as later attested by early Tifinagh (or Libyco-Berber) inscriptions, and as understood from Latin and Greek historical sources. Despite the presence or growth of Latin, and later Arabic, in some urban areas, Berber remained the majority language of Algeria since ancient times until well after the French invasion in 1830.

Arabic remained Algeria&#x27;s only official language until 2002, when Berber was recognized as a second national language. And in 2016 Berber was recognized as a second official language of Algeria.

The 1963 constitution and the 1976 constitution do not mention Berber and French. The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) stated &quot;official attitudes towards both Berber and French have been largely negative&quot; and &quot;The Algerian authorities have even at times rejected use of the very word “Berber”, either on the secular grounds that the term undermines national unity, or on the religious grounds that it is a term hostile to Identity and prefer to call it Tamazight another name for Berber.&quot; Berber and French are the two languages commonly used in the Kabylie region.

The Berber languages/dialects spoken in Algeria include:

====In the north====
* Kabyle, about 3 million speakers mostly in Kabylie and surrounding regions.
* Shawiya (also called &quot;Tachawit&quot;, Chawi) in the Aurès, with about 2 million speakers.
* Shenwa, in the Dahra region, particularly of Jebel Chenoua in Algeria, just west of Algiers near Tipaza province and Cherchell and the Chlef., estimated 56,300 speakers. Two main dialects: Beni Menacer, west and south of Mount Chenoua area, in the Mount Chenoua area, 55,250 speakers.
* The Tamazight of Blida, traditionally spoken in the wilaya of Blida.
* The Matmata dialect, spoken in some villages of the Ouarsenis region.

====In the extreme northwest====
* Beni Snous and Beni Said, dialects of Berber spoken in various villages of the wilaya of Tlemcen.

====In the Sahara====
*Mozabite (Tumẓabt) in the M&#x27;zab
*language of Touat-Gourara (called &quot;Taznatit&quot; by the Ethnologue, but that name is used for most of the Zenati languages)
*language of Touggourt and Temacine
*Tamahaq, among the Tuareg of the Hoggar (see Tuareg languages)

===French===

The CIA World Factbook states that French is a lingua franca of Algeria. The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) states &quot;In reality, French is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Algeria&quot;, and that despite government efforts to remove French, it has never ceased being the lingua franca. Algeria is the second largest Francophone country in the world in terms of speakers. In 2008, 11.2 million Algerians (33%) could read and write in French.

The 1963 and 1976 constitutions do not mention Berber and French. The PCGN stated &quot;official attitudes towards both Berber and French have been largely negative&quot;. French and Berber are the two languages commonly used in the Kabylie region.

French is a part of the standard school curriculum, and is widely understood (18 million Algerians can write and read French, which is 50% of the population, and the figure is higher if those who can only speak and understand it are included; Ethnologue estimates indicate that 10 200 people in Algeria speak it as their native language, mostly pied-noirs who stayed behind and people raised in French-speaking households.) Some two-thirds of Algerians have a &quot;fairly broad&quot; grasp of French, and half speak it as a second language. French is widely used in media and commerce. French is widely used and spoken in everyday life in Algeria&#x27;s larger cities, in diglossic combination with Algerian Arabic. Malika Rebai Mammri, author of &quot;The Syndrome of the French Language in Algeria,&quot; said &quot;French continues to be the dominant language in business and professional circles&quot; and that &quot;certain aspects of formal education and research are still carried in the French language and a great part of the economic and industrial sectors and press still use French extensively.&quot;

French is the most widely studied foreign language in the country, and a majority of Algerians can understand it and speak it. Since independence, the government has pursued a policy of linguistic Arabization of education and bureaucracy, which has resulted in limiting the use of Berber and the Arabization of many Berber-speakers. The strong position of French in Algeria was little affected by the Arabization policy. All scientific and business university courses are still taught in French. Recently, schools have begun to incorporate French into the curriculum as early as children are taught written classical Arabic. French is also used in media and business. After a political debate in Algeria in the late 1990s about whether to replace French with English in the educational system, the government decided to retain French. English is taught in the first year of middle schools.

In spite of its widespread use of French, Algeria has not joined the &quot;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&quot;, an international organization of French-speaking countries. Although not a member, they attend for it.

In 2014, 76% of Facebook users in Algeria posted in French, while 32% posted in Arabic. In 2016 68% used Facebook in French, while 43% used it in Arabic.

===English===

According to the Algerian envoy to India, only five percent of the population are able to speak &quot;good English&quot;. That led the Government to invite Indians to teach the language in Algerian universities in 2012. Some 100 institutes affiliated to 13 Algerian universities needed nearly 250 English teachers in early 2012.

===Korandje===
The Korandje language of the Saharan oasis of Tabelbala is a heavily Berber-influenced variety of Songhay. A Nilo-Saharan language, it is more widely spoken far to the south in Niger.

===Sign languages===
Algerian Sign Language is used in Algeria by the deaf; it has sometimes been used on national TV.

==Formerly spoken languages==

===Phoenician===
Phoenician, particularly in its North African Punic form, was brought to Algeria by Carthage&#x27;s influence, it was an influential language in the region; Augustine learned it, and quotes occasional phrases. However, by his time the language was losing ground to Latin, and no trace of it survives now (apart from occasional names of places).

===Latin===
Latin (which later developed into the brief-existent, little-known African Romance language) was the language of the Roman occupation; it became widely spoken in the coastal towns, and Augustine attests that in his day it was gaining ground over Punic. However, it continued to flourish until the 11th century especially in towns and in Tunisia. It died out in the 14th century.

===Ottoman Turkish===
Ottoman rule after the 16th century brought a dominant minority of Turks to Algeria, particularly concentrated in the large cities; for a while, Ottoman Turkish became a major governmental language. However, over time these Turks gradually assimilated, and, while many families of partial Turkish descent remain in Algeria, none speak the language.

===Other===
*Ladino was formerly spoken by some Algerian Jews, particularly around Oran, in the Tetuani dialect; however, most shifted to French during the colonial period.
*The Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a mixture of many Mediterranean languages, was once widespread as a means of communication with foreigners in the ports, including the slaves of the bagnios and the European renegades that joined the Barbary pirates; after 1830, it gradually disappeared, its functions taken over by French.
*Spanish has a long history in Oran, which was occupied by Spain for long periods between 1509 and 1790; it has left some traces in that city&#x27;s dialect. It was also spoken by pied-noirs immigrating from the Spanish Mediterranean. Spanish is also spoken by the Sahrawis living in refugee camps in the area of Tindouf. As of 2020, there are two Instituto Cervantes in Algiers and Oran, promoting the study and the teaching of Spanish language and culture.
*Patuet is a Catalan dialect with French and Arabic influences spoken by pied-noirs from Catalan-speaking areas.

==Languages used in the Algerian government==
Mohamed Benrabah, author of &quot;Language maintenance and spread: French in Algeria,&quot; said that as of 2007, &quot;Arabization is either complete or almost complete&quot; in the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Religious Affairs and registry offices in Algerian town halls. He also said that the Ministry of Education had been affected to a &quot;lesser extent.&quot; Official documents of ministries which had not been affected partially or fully to Arabization are often written in French, and Arabic translations of these documents are provided when needed. Benrabah said that as of 2007 &quot;the use of French in a number of higher domains has diminished since the colonial era when the language held an unassailable position in the media, education, government, and administration.&quot;

In 1968 the Algerian government decreed that all civil positions use the Arabic language. In 1990 the government ruled that Arabic is the only language to be used in institutions and public service, and imprisonment was a penalty for violating this law. Around 1997 the Algerian government had passed laws prohibiting officials from speaking any language other than Arabic publicly. The government laws called for a fine for officials who prepared government documents not in Arabic. The government mandated that all textbooks and lectures must be Arabic, with French ones being phased out. The laws also stated that all television broadcasts must be in Arabic only. In 1997, Slimane Chikh, the Minister of Education, said that French needed to be phased out because it was preventing Arabic from reaching prominence and because it was leading Algerians away from English, the primary international language of commerce, computers, and science.

Of the documents submitted by the Algerian government to the sessions of the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names and the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, all were in French, and the government used French in its participation in almost all of the conferences associated with these groups.

==Languages used in Algerian education==
As of 2007, Arabization has mainly affected primary and secondary education, while in university education French retained a higher social prestige and class and is the language used in scientific studies. As of 2002, French was taught as a foreign language from the fourth year of primary school until the final year of secondary school. French is used in the high school level in the exact sciences, the medical sciences, and technology studies. Some specialized fields offer courses in French and courses in Arabic. Almost all students prefer the French courses in those fields. Over 60% of university students in Algeria are educated in French. In graduate programmes in social sciences, French is used.

===History of languages in Algerian education===
The first President of Algeria, Ahmed ben Bella, introduced Arabization in the education system in 1962. The Arabic language was introduced in all levels and all programmes in the 1963–1964 period. As time passed, the time in the educational system spent on French gradually declined. In 1964–1965 primary grade one was fully Arabized with all other levels each receiving ten hours of Arabic per period. The plans were complicated by the flight of 25,000 European teachers from Algeria and the illiteracy rate of 90%. The demographics also complicated the plans. Of 10 million Algerians, about 300,000 were fluent in Modern Standard Arabic while 1 million were able to read French and 6 million were able to speak French. To remedy this, the Algerian government hired 10,988 academic monitors. C. F. Gallagher, author of &quot;North African problems and prospects: Language and identity&quot;, said that the monitors&#x27; &quot;intellectual horizons [were] at times only slightly less limited than their pupils&quot;. In 1963 the government recruited 1,000 Egyptians as Arabic teachers. Mohamed Benrabah, author of &quot;Language-in-Education Planning in Algeria: Historical Development and Current Issues&quot;, said &quot;Most of these teachers turned out to be unqualified for teaching and totally ignorant of the Algerian social reality&quot; and that &quot;Their spoken Egyptian Arabic was incomprehensible to Algerians in general and Tamazight-speaking populations in particular and their traditional pedagogy (learning by rote and class recitation, physical punishment and so on) proved inadequate&quot;. In addition the teachers were members of the Muslim Brotherhood and introduced Islamist thought in Algeria. In September 1967 Minister of Education Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi completely Arabized primary level two, so many parents delayed registration of their children in school until grade three when they could have a higher educational quality and where the French language was still dominant.

The Algerian government had plans to totally Arabize the university sector effective December 1980. In all levels of education, bilingual education ended in 1985. In that period many Algerian elites practiced &quot;elite closure&quot; by sending their own children to schools controlled by the French government while promoting Arabization for the masses, so their own children would learn French and have access to jobs open to those with French knowledge. Since most young Algerians had a poor command of French and were in Arabized school streams, they enrolled in Arabic-language university departments such as Islamic law and Arabic literature and were exposed to Islamist points of view. Algiers had many unofficially bilingual primary and secondary schools and Benrabah said that the elite closure practice was &quot;most visible in Algiers&quot;. The Algerian government, in 1988, officially prohibited Algerian nationals and children of mixed Algerian and French people from attending &quot;French Mission of Algeria&quot; schools. President Chadli Bendjedid ruled that Algerian nationals were not permitted to attend all-French schools. The Algiers French lycée moved from one neighbourhood to another. The &quot;Lycée Cheikh Bouamama&quot; (), originally called the &quot;Lycée Descartes&quot;, took in students from the &quot;tchitchi&quot; (children of wealthy) backgrounds instead of &quot;bohi&quot; (&quot;rejects&quot;). When it was nationalized it served members of the educational, military, and political elites. After Chadli&#x27;s decree, the school had a secret program which placed higher emphasis on French than other Algerian secondary schools did. Many students in the programme attended universities abroad after graduation.

In 1999 the Algerian authorities conducted a survey which stated that 75% of the population supported teaching scientific school subjects in the French language. In the middle of March 2001 the National Commission for the Reform of the Educational System (CNRSE according to its French name) proposed that French would be reintroduced in grade two of the primary cycle, serving 6–7 year olds, instead of grade four, serving 8–9 year olds, and that scientific subjects in secondary school should be taught in French. Therefore, students would be biliterate in French and Arabic instead of having French as a subject. In 2002 the opponents to the bilingual educational proposal declared a &quot;fatwa&quot; against the pro-bilingual supporters. The reforms were intended to be implemented in September 2001 but the Ministry of the Interior suspended them on 3 September 2001.

By 2008 the Algerian government began reintroducing French in the school system.

<doc id="944951" wikidata="Q433990" url="?curid=944951" title="Alexander Povetkin">
<text>Alexander Vladimirovich &quot;Sasha&quot; Povetkin (; born 2 September 1979) is a Russian former professional boxer who competed from 2005 to 2021. He held the World Boxing Association (WBA) (Regular version) heavyweight title from 2011 to 2013; the World Boxing Council (WBC) (Interim version) heavyweight title from 2020 to 2021; and challenged twice for the unified heavyweight championship in 2013 and 2018.

As an amateur, Povetkin won gold medals in the super-heavyweight division at the 2002 and 2004 European Championships, 2003 World Championships, and 2004 Olympics. After turning professional in 2005, he defeated Ruslan Chagaev to claim the inaugural WBA (Regular) title in 2011. After performing five consecutive defenses, he challenged Klitschko for the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, and &quot;The Ring&quot; titles in 2013, suffering his first professional career loss by unanimous decision. In 2018, Povetkin would challenge again for the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO titles, this time against Joshua, and suffered a seventh-round technical knockout loss.

He was rated in the top ten annual heavyweights by BoxRec from 2006 to 2020, and rated in the top five annual heavyweights from 2007 to 2020, except for 2019.
He is a one-time winner of the WBC KO of the Year (2020) and Premier Boxing Champions Knockout of the Year (2020).

==Amateur career==
After a successful amateur kickboxing career that included winning World Junior championship in 1997, a World title in 1999 and a European professional kickboxing title in 2000, Povetkin won his first major boxing tournament at the Russian Championships in 2000 at the age of 21. This would be the beginning of several major amateur tournaments Povetkin would go on to win including; the Good Will Games in Brisbane, Australia in 2001; the 34th European Championship in 2002; the XII World Championship in 2003 held in Thailand; and the 35th European Championship in 2004. His amateur success would culminate in winning the gold medal at super-heavyweight (&gt;91 kg) boxing at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, in a walkover match over Egyptian Mohamed Aly.
After taking Olympic Gold, he concluded his amateur career with a record of 125–7, with all losses avenged.

==Professional career==

=== 2005-2007: Early career ===
Povetkin&#x27;s early career was without renown. He first pulled notice when, after compiling a perfect record of 12–0, he defeated veteran Larry Donald on 30 June 2007 by unanimous decision in Moscow in his 13th professional fight.

===2007–2011: IBF heavyweight title tournament===
The win over Donald was considered solid, and Povetkin continued his emergence as a promising heavyweight boxing contender.

On 27 October 2007 Povetkin met Chris Byrd, who had lost his title to Klitschko the year before. Povetkin won by way of an 11th-round TKO victory. Byrd put up more resistance than Donald, but ultimately was overwhelmed, and his corner threw in the towel.

Less than a week later, Eddie Chambers won a split decision victory over former title challenger Calvin Brock. This advanced Povetkin and Chambers to the final round of the tournament. On 26 January 2008, after initial problems Povetkin defeated Chambers by unanimous decision to become the mandatory challenger for Klitschko. On 19 July 2008, Povetkin knocked out Taurus Sykes in the fourth round.

===2011–2013: WBA (Regular) heavyweight champion===

====Povetkin vs. Chagaev====
After Wladimir Klitschko unified his WBO and IBF titles with David Haye&#x27;s WBA title, Klitschko was upgraded to &quot;Super Champion&quot; by the WBA, thus making the &quot;Regular Champion&quot; title vacant. On 6 July 2011 negotiations for Povetkin to fight former WBA champion Ruslan Chagaev (27-1-1, 17 KOs) for the vacant title began between Sauerland, who promote Povetkin, and Chagaev&#x27;s promoter Universum. Two days later, Povetkin&#x27;s trainer confirmed the fight would take place on 27 August. At the time of the bout, Povetkin was ranked No.3 heavyweight contender by &quot;The Ring&quot;, while Chagaev was ranked No.4 contender by the same publication. There were concerns about Chagaev&#x27;s health state, due to him being diagnosed with hepatitis B and the possibility of him infecting Povetkin. Chagaev, however, insisted that the medical examination had confirmed that his opponents (Povetkin included) weren&#x27;t in danger of being infected. Most observers expected the fight to be close, giving Povetkin the edge in youth and athletic ability, while also giving Chagaev an advantage in terms of experience. Both fighters were given an even chance to win. Former WBA world champion Nikolai Valuev predicted Povetkin to win by decision or knockout in the championship rounds. The card was televised by Das Erste.

With Teddy Atlas in his corner, Povetkin bested Chagaev by unanimous decision to capture the WBA (Regular) heavyweight title. Both fighters were active from the opening bell, with Povetkin appearing to have the upper hand in the first half of the fight, frequently closing the distance and working Chagaev&#x27;s body, while blocking most Chagaev&#x27;s shots with arms and gloves. Povetkin staggered Chagaev with an uppercut in the third round. Chagaev regained composure in the middle rounds, hurting tired Povetkin several times with clubbing left hooks. Povetkin withstood Chagaev&#x27;s attacks and re-established his pressure going into the championship rounds, while Chagaev appeared to be saving energy for the last rounds. The twelfth round saw both fighters trading shots.
 The bout went full twelve rounds, with Povetkin being declared the winner by unanimous decision. The scores were 116–112 (twice) and 117–113, all in favor of Povetkin. According to CompuBox, Povetkin landed 152 punches out of 533 thrown (28.5%) with 112 landed power shots (39.6%), while Chagaev landed 72 punches out of 416 thrown (17.1%) with 62 power punches (35.2%). Povetkin landed more shots in every round and also landed more power punches in all but the first two rounds (2nd round being even).

Following the fight, 48 year old former world champion Evander Holyfield entered the ring to congratulate Povetkin. Holyfield also attended the post-fight press conference and made the intention of challenging Povetkin for the WBA&#x27;s secondary title. Povetkin announced his first defence would be in December 2011, possibly in Zurich, Switzerland.

====Povetkin vs. Boswell====
On 16 October 2011, a fight between Povetkin and 42 year old American heavyweight contender Cedric Boswell (35-1, 26 KOs) was close to being confirmed for 3 December at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki. Boswell was on a 14-fight win streak since his sole defeat to former four-time world title challenger Jameel McCline. The fight was originally offered to former WBC champion Hasim Rahman, who asked for more money than Sauerland Event&#x27;s could offer. Povetkin&#x27;s team then spoke to the WBA about possible opponents. Most of the ranked fighters were not willing to travel to fight Povetkin, where as some contenders were not available. French heavyweight Jean Marc Mormeck turned down the opportunity to fight Povetkin because he was being lined up to challenge then-unified world champion Wladimir Klitschko. On 21 October, Boswell confirmed that he had signed the deal and a day later, a heavyweight double-header was announced for 3 December, with the other fight being Robert Helenius vs. Derek Chisora. Povetkin already started his training with Kostya Tszyu and cruiserweight contender Denis Lebedev and in mid-October, Teddy Atlas joined the training camp. Povetkin won the fight by 8th-round KO. At the time of the stoppage, Povetkin was ahead 70–63, 69–64, and 70–63 on the scorecards. Povetkin came alive in the fight at the midway point, rocking Boswell a few times with some hard punches. In the 8th round, Povetkin connected with a combination that dropped Boswell and eventually counted out. Boswell managed to get to his feet after the count had finished, only to fall back down.

==== Povetkin vs. Huck ====
In December 2011, a deal was reached for Povetkin to make his second defence against then WBO cruiserweight champion Marco Huck (34-1, 25KOs) on 25 February 2012 at Porsche Arena in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg. Huck made the challenge in the post fight press conference of Povetkin&#x27;s win over Boswell. It was noted that Huck would not vacate his WBO title, until after the fight, where he would assess the situation. Huck stated if he was to win the title, he would likely remain at heavyweight to challenge one of the Klitschko brothers, but would be given 10 days by the WBO to decide. Huck reached out to David Haye and Evander Holyfield to help with sparring. In January 2012, the promoters of Huck, Povetkin and Rahman attended a meeting where they discussed the winner of Povetkin vs. Huck would defend the WBA title against Rahman next. During this time, trainer Teddy Atlas was in contract for Povetkin to come train in the USA but Povetkin refused, then Teddy Atlas announced he had parted ways with Povetkin. Russian trainer Alexander Zimin stepped in on short notice. For his debut at heavyweight, Huck weighed 209.4 pounds and Povetkin weighed 229.2 pounds.

Povetkin won the fight via majority decision. The fight proved to be a tough test for Povetkin. One judge scored the fight a 114–114 draw, whilst the remaining two judges scoring the fight 116–113, and 116–112 in favour of Povetkin. All three ringside announcers from EPIX scored the fight in favour of Huck. Chisora and Dimitrenko, who were sat ringside, scored the fight a draw. Arthur Abraham and Tomasz Adamek scored the fight clearly for Huck. The opening round started off slow however Povetkin started taking over the fight landing body shots and using his straight rights. In round 4, Huck began to let his hands go and found his range, even rocking Povetkin. Huck controlled the championship rounds as Povetkin began to show signs of fatigue. Huck came close to dropping Povetkin in the final round. After the fight, Povetkin admitted, &quot;I underestimated him. Perhaps I didn&#x27;t take this fight seriously enough.&quot; Huck said, &quot;A lot of people who saw this fight see me as the winner.&quot; It was reported that Huck had injured his right between rounds 6 and 7. The verdict was met with boos around the arena.

====Povetkin vs. Rahman, Wawrzyk====
Despite rematch called for Povetkin vs. Huck, Team Sauerland firmly stated that as previously negotiated, a fight with former WBC world champion Hasim Rahman (50-7-2, 41 KOs) would be next. It was originally for 14 July 2012 at Upton Park in West Ham, London, with David Haye vs. Derek Chisora as the main event. The venue was later changed to Alsterdorfer Sporthalle in Alsterdorf, Hamburg. On 28 June, Rahman pulled out with a hand injury. The fight was rescheduled for 29 September with Kubrat Pulev vs. Alexander Ustinov for the European title as co-feature. The opening round saw very little action between both fighters. Round 2 saw Povetkin come out throwing and landing at will with Rahman spending most of the round against the ropes. Rahman did not throw back and eventually referee Gustavo Padilla stepped in to stop the fight. At the same time, Rahman&#x27;s corner appeared to be on the ring apron with a towel. The fight was slated as a miss-match. After the fight, Povetkin said, &quot;I&#x27;m ready to fight everybody. When (my handlers) say it&#x27;s time to fight Klitschko, I will be ready. He&#x27;s the best heavyweight in the world and I will be ready to fight him.&quot; According to CompuBox Stats, Povetkin landed 42 of 85 punches thrown (49%), this included 33 power punches and Rahman landed 10 of his 44 thrown (23%), 2 of which were power shots.

In April 2013, prior to a big showdown with Wladimir Klitschko, Povetkin chose to fight Andrzej Wawrzyk (27-0, 13 KOs) on 17 May, in a voluntary title defence. Team Sauerland revealed as part of the deal, if Wawrzyk pulled an upset, he would sign with Sauerland Event on a 3-fight deal. The fight took place at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow. Like most of Povetkin&#x27;s fights, the first round had very little action. Povetkin dropped Wawrzyk in round 2 with a right hand. Wawrzyk beat the count and barely made it to the end of the round. In round 3, Povetkin carried on landing big punches, dropping Wawrzyk a further two times before the referee intervened to stop the fight. In the post-fight, Povetkin said, &quot;I just wanted to show some offensive arsenal. I trained for a longer fight but, well, it has ended pretty fast. We didn&#x27;t plan to win by a TKO.&quot;

====Povetkin vs. Klitschko====
At the end of 2012, the World Boxing Association ordered its super-champion Wladimir Klitschko (60-3, 52 KOs) to fight regular-champion Povetkin by 24 February 2013, but the two sides couldn&#x27;t reach an agreement. WBA let Klitschko have another voluntary title defence before taking on Povetkin, but there should have been a signed contract with Povetkin before 28 February, with a new deadline for their bout no later than 31 July.

Promoter Vladimir Hryunov won the right to promote Klitschko vs. Povetkin with a purse bid of $23,333,330 and Russian businessman Andrey Ryabinsky putting up the money. Failed bids made were from K2 Promotions ($7,130,000) and Povetkin&#x27;s promoter Sauerland Event ($6,014,444). It allowed Ryabinsky to dictate the location of the fight and guaranteed the fighters the biggest purses of their careers. Based on being entitled to 75 percent of the winning bid, Klitschko got $17,499,997, while Povetkin received $5,833,333. The Klitschko camp were said to be surprised by the bid. The fight was expected to generate around 100 million viewers in Europe. It was reported that the President of Russia Vladimir Putin was going to attend the fight.

The fight took place in October 2013, Klitschko&#x27;s third consecutive undefeated opponent. The bout was marred with over 160 clinches, most initiated by Klitschko, followed by several repeated roughhouse tactics throughout the match. This included Klitschko&#x27;s leaning on his opponent and pushing his head down and throwing Povetkin away to prevent Povetkin from clinching, which resulted in the referee scoring some of Povetkin&#x27;s fallings as knockdowns, as well as Povetkin&#x27;s punching after referee&#x27;s break command and leaning his head too low. Klitschko won by unanimous decision scoring a knockdown in round 2 from a quick left hook, and 3 knockdowns in round 7 including one prompted from a straight right hand. All 3 judges scored it 119–104 on the scorecards. Klitschko landed 139 of 417 punches (33%) and Povetkin connected on 59 of 283 (21%). After the fight, Klitschko told in the interview that he had little desire to go for the knockout as the Russian crowd would be disappointed, which lead to speculations about the alleged agreement between the champion and organisers to let the bout go the distance, which Klitschko later denied. With 9.2 rating, the fight became the most popular sporting event on Russian television in 2013, as well as the most watched TV programme of the year in the capital of Russia with 13.9 rating, surpassing the Moscow Victory Day Parade.

===2014–2015: Return victories===

====Povetkin vs. Charr, Takam====
Povetkin bounced back in 2014, completely changing his training routine and diet. On 2 May 2014, it was confirmed that he would fight former world title challenger, WBC #7 ranked Manuel Charr (26-1, 15 KOs) on 30 May. Povetkin claimed the vacant WBC International title after stopping Charr in 7 rounds. Both fighters started off strong with Charr landing his jab, however at the same time, Povetkin managed to land big uppercuts. Over the next three rounds, both fighters continued to press on the attack. At the end of round 4, Charr had managed to only win one round on all three judges scorecards. In round 7, Povetkin landed a three-punch combination which dropped Charr, flat on his back. Referee Massimo Barrovecchio did not count and stopped the fight immediately at 1 minute and 9 seconds.

In August 2014 it was announced a deal was close to being reached which would see Povetkin challenge French-Cameroonian contender Carlos Takam (30-1-1, 23 KOs) for his WBC Silver heavyweight title. A few days later, World of Boxing promoter Andrei Ryabinsky stated the contracts had been signed for the fight to take place on 24 October at the Palace of Sports in Luzhniki. In what was considered a back and forth fight and potential fight of the year, Povetkin scored a round 10 KO win to secure the WBC Silver title. At the end of round 4, two judges had Takam ahead 39–37 and 39–38, whilst the remaining judge had Povetkin ahead 39–37. From round 8, Povetkin began to increase the number of punches he was throwing and in round 9, referee Kenny Bayless issued a standing 8-count to Takam after Povetkin landed some unanswered shots, which had Takam held up by the ropes. Takam failed to recover and in round 10, Povetkin landed a left hook to his chin, dropping Takam. Bayless waved the fight off immediately. BoxingScene.com voted the final punch as their knockout of the year for 2014.

====Povetkin vs. Perez, Wach====
It was announced that Povetkin&#x27;s next fight against Irish based Cuban contender Mike Perez (21-1-1, 13 KOs) would take place on 22 May 2015 and serve as a final eliminator for the WBC heavyweight title, held by American boxer Deontay Wilder. Due to the winner potentially being next in line to challenge Wilder, ESPN announced they would air the fight live on ESPN3.com. Povetkin earned a mandatory title shot by knocking out Perez in the first round in devastating fashion. The fight lasted just 91 seconds. Povetkin sent the southpaw Perez down with three right hands. Perez beat the count, then took a beating on the ropes, ending the contest.

In August 2015, a deal was reached for Povetkin to fight once beaten former world title challenger Mariusz Wach (31-1, 17 KOs) in Kazan, Russia 4 November 2015. Wach had previously gone 12 rounds with Wladimir Klitschko. The fight would be the main event of a packed Russian card that featured multiple world title fights. After the fight was announced, Povetkin spoke of his disappointment of not being able to land Wilder on the same date. Wach started off the fight with success, keeping the smaller Povetkin at range with his jab. But as the rounds went on, Povetkin was able to find his range and begin to push Wach around the ring with combinations on the inside. Towards the end of the fight, with both participants cut, Povetkin urged the referee stoppage as he deemed Wach, who was being hit at will essentially, unable to continue. On the morning of the fight, the WBC approved another voluntary defence for Wilder, which would likely take place in January 2016. This meant the potential Wilder vs. Povetkin fight would take place around May 2016. Wach allegedly only received 10% of his purse, due to his ongoing difficulties with his promoter Jimmy Burchfield. In December, it was reported that Wach failed a post-fight drug test.

===2016: WBC heavyweight title contention===

====Povetkin vs. Wilder, cancellation====
It was announced that Povetkin would fight WBC World Champion Deontay Wilder (36-0, 35 KOs) in Moscow, Russia, on a date set to yet be announced at the Megasport Arena. It was originally set for May 21, 2016. However, on May 14, it was reported that Povetkin had failed a drug test. The fight has been put in jeopardy after he tested positive for the banned substance meldonium. Promotor Andrei Ryabinsky added that Povetkin did take meldonium last year, but stopped before it was banned, and only &quot;leftover traces of meldonium at a very low concentration&quot; were found in a blood sample given by the 36-year-old last month. It was reported on May 15, that the assertion from Povetkin&#x27;s promoter that it was in his system only because he took it late last year, before it was banned, appeared untrue. The WBC announced on May 15, a week before the fight that it would be postponed. On May 31, it was announced on Sky Sports by Povetkin&#x27;s promoters that new drug test results prove the Povetkin is a clean athlete. The new doping test, taken May 17, showed no traces of meldonium. This was reported by VADA.

====Povetkin vs. Stiverne, cancellation====
With Wilder out until early 2017, the WBC ordered mandatory challenger Povetkin to fight former world champion Bermane Stiverne for the interim WBC heavyweight title. Stiverne previously held the WBC title losing his first defence to Wilder. The winner would eventually go on to challenge Wilder upon his return for the full version of the title. A purse bid was scheduled for October 10. The purse bid was won by World of Boxing promoter Andrey Ryabinsky. The winning bid was $3.165 million, beating out the two other bids, one from Don King for $2.1 million and another from Eye of the Tiger promotions for $542,000. Povetkin and Stiverne are due to earn a base purse of $1,424,250 each due to a 50–50 split, with the winner receiving the remainder $316,500 as a bonus.

On November 11, the WBC were told by VADA that Stiverne had tested positive on a drug test. It was said that the banned substance was methylhexaneamine, which is also known as dimethylamylamine or &#x27;DMAA&#x27;. Povetkin&#x27;s camp confirmed the fight will still go ahead. Stiverne claimed he ingested a post-workout supplement called SUPERPHARM without knowing it included dimethylamylamine, but under VADA’s rules an athlete is responsible for whatever goes into their body. The WBC took into account that it was Stiverne’s first offence when making its ruling and fined him $75,000. Just 20 hours before the fight was to take place, the WBC withdrew its sanction of the fight stating Povetkin had failed another drug test, this time for Ostarine. The test was taken of December 6. Stiverne later made a statement to tell everyone he will be heading home to Las Vegas and did not want to fight if the sanction was off, as that was the whole reason for him training and taking the fight in Russia. Following the cancellation, Stiverne&#x27;s promoter Don King stated he would be filing a lawsuit against World of Boxing promoter Andrey Ryabinsky, just as Ryabinsky did against King when Lebedev pulled out of his scheduled rematch against Guillermo Jones, after Jones tested positive for a second time. At that time, Ryabinsky was awarded $1.6m in damages. On December 23, Ryabinsky stated that Povetkin&#x27;s sample from December 13 came back negative. Ryabinsky claimed that the test where he had tested positive contained 0,00000000001g traces of ostarine and a previous random test in November also came back negative.

====Povetkin vs. Duhaupas====
After Stiverne withdrew himself from the title claiming he would be heading home, there was ongoing talks for WBC Silver heavyweight champion Johann Duhaupas (34-3, 21 KOs) to step in and fight Povetkin instead. Hours later it was confirmed that the fight would take place on short notice with no titles at stake. Povetkin dominated and knocked out Duhaupas in the 6th round. Povetkin had Duhaupas hurt in the 4th round after connecting with a right hand to the head. The end came when Povetkin hurt Duhaupas with two left hooks to the head in round 6 to knock him down and out. The fight was halted by the referee, as Duhaupas was badly hurt from the left hands. The official time of the stoppage was at 2:59 of the 6th round.

=== 2017–2018: Rebuilding career ===

====Fine and suspension====
On March 3, 2017, Povetkin was handed a fine of $250,000 and banned indefinitely by the World Boxing Council for failing drug tests. Their ban meant they would no longer sanction his fights. It was also noted on the documents presented by the WBC that Povetkin would be allowed to apply in March 2018 to be included in the rankings. The lifetime ban was lifted by the WBC on 8 December 2017. it was announced that Povetkin would be inserted back into the WBC rankings from January 2018.

====Povetkin vs. Rudenko====
On 16 May 2017 it was confirmed that Povetkin would return to the ring on 1 July in Moscow. In a statement, Povetkin said: &quot;I do not care with who I fight with. I&#x27;m sure my team will pick me a good interesting opponent, with whom we will have a spectacular fight. My job is to train and show good boxing ability. I&#x27;m ready to fight against any opponent.&quot; His promoter, Andrei Ryabinsky was in talks with several candidates. On 24 May, it was announced that Povetkin would fight Andriy Rudenko (31-2, 19 KOs), who was ranked 9th by the WBO; and 13th by the WBC and IBF. The fight was being billed as a &quot;Battle of Russia vs. Ukraine&quot;, despite the fact that Rudenko was relatively unknown in Ukraine, where the fight was featured on rather smaller TV channel XSPORT instead of Inter. Rudenko was on a seven-fight winning streak following back-to-back losses to Lucas Browne and Hughie Fury. On 14 June, the WBO decided to sanction the bout and announced that the vacant WBO International heavyweight title would be at stake.

Soon after the fight began Rudenko had problems right away. The fight almost came to an end in the first round after Povetkin accidentally hit Rudenko in the back of his neck with an overhand punch in the middle of a clinch. Rudenko spent five minutes complaining that he had injured his neck while Povetkin waited patiently in the corner to resume but fans in attendance began to whistle in displeasure at Rudenko whom they saw as feigning injury. The ringside doctor determined that Rudenko had a spasm and that Rudenko wanted to pull out of the fight. However the referee eventually persuaded Rudenko to continue. During the interval between rounds eight and nine Rudenko again wanted to stop the fight but his corner firmly insisted on continuing. Povetkin went on to control every round winning a one-sided fight on all three judges scorecards 120–109, 120–108, and 120–108. Along with the WBO International title Povetkin also won the WBA Continental title. Following the win the IBF re-instated Povetkin into the rankings for July 2017. He was placed at No. 13 ranking.

====Povetkin vs. Hammer====

On 10 October 2017, it was revealed that Povetkin would return to fight at the DIVS in Yekaterinburg on 15 December. It was rumoured that his opponent would be No. 2 WBO Christian Hammer (22-4, 12 KOs) in a title eliminator. #4 WBO Tom Schwrtz was also considered. Povetkin&#x27;s promoter, World of Boxing stated the WBO International title would be at stake. At the time, Hammer was on a five-fight win streak since his last loss, to the hands of Tyson Fury in February 2015. On 23 October, Alexei Titov, executive director of RCC Boxing Promotions who were working to organise the event, stated that he would attend WBO&#x27;s annual convention in the next week and ask them to sanction the bout as a final eliminator. On 31 October, Hammer&#x27;s promoter Erol Ceylan of EC Boxpromotion confirmed the bout. A month prior to the fight, Povetkin&#x27;s manager announced that former cruiserweight contender BJ Flores (34-3-1, 21 KOs), who had previously called out Povetkin, would be on standby as a replacement in case Hammer withdrew or could not make the fight. A deal could not be reached with Flores, and instead Japanese contender Kyotaro Fujimoto (18-1, 10 KOs) signed the contract to become the back-up. On 8 November, the WBC announced that they would be lifting the lifetime ban effective immediately from 7 December 2017. From this date, WBC would start a probation period which would end on 6 December 2018. The ruling also stated that Povetkin would be re-instated in the WBC rankings in January 2018. Povetkin outworked a survival-oriented Hammer to win a lopsided 12 round unanimous decision, in what was a final eliminator to the WBA title, held by Anthony Joshua. The three judges&#x27; scores were 120–107, 120–108, and 118–108. The referee had warned Hammer repeatedly to stop putting Povetkin in headlocks, but he did not stop, eventually having a point deducted in round 7. Hammer came alive towards the end of each round, landing some big shots, at times knocking Povetkin off balance. After the fight, promoter Andrey Ryabinskiy said, “I have confirmation from WBA that Anthony Joshua must fight the winner of Povetkin-Hammer.”

==== Povetkin vs. Price ====
On 16 January 2018, after unification fight Anthony Joshua vs. Joseph Parker was announced, promoter Eddie Hearn offered Povetkin an opportunity to fight on the undercard, which would take place on 31 March at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. Contenders Derek Chisora and David Price were mentioned as potential opponents. The next day, Price spoke to Sky Sports stating they accepted Hearn&#x27;s offer and would be willing to fight Povetkin. On 30 January, Hearn told a reporter a deal was close being done after Povetkin also agreed to the fight. Three days later, the fight was officially confirmed. Povetkin won the fight via knockout in round 5. Povetkin badly hurt Price with a right hand, who was then defenceless, Povetkin finished off with a left hook that put Price down flat on the canvas. Without a count, referee Howard John Foster halted the fight. The official time of the stoppage was at 1:02 of round 5. In round 3, Povetkin knocked Price down with a right hand to the head. Price got up and came back strong landing some hard punches of his own. Price hurt Povetkin late in round 3 with a left hook which resulted in Povetkin falling backwards towards the ropes. The referee ruled it a knockdown due to the ropes holding Povetkin up. Price did not take advantage of the knockdown, but it looked as though he had tired himself out. With the win, Povetkin was now in position to become Anthony Joshua&#x27;s mandatory challenger from the WBA and WBO. Joshua picked up the WBO title in defeating Joseph Parker in the main event. Dillian Whyte, who at the time was ranked WBC #1 stated he would fight Povetkin.

==== Povetkin vs. Joshua ====
From April up until the end of June 2018, both camps of Anthony Joshua (21-0, 20 KOs) and Deontay Wilder were in deep talks around the super fight to finally take place. The main hurdles were split, date and venue. At one point Wilder had agreed to fight Joshua in the UK, however there was slight confusions in the contracts that were being sent back and forth. At the same time, Hearn was also working a deal out for Joshua to fight WBA mandatory challenger Povetkin. The WBA initially ordered the fight after Povetkin knocked out David Price on the Joshua-Parker undercard. Negotiations took a turn on 26 June when the WBA gave Joshua&#x27;s camp 24 hours to finalise a deal with Povetkin. With Joshua closer to fighting Povetkin in September 2018, Hearn stated the Joshua-Wilder fight would still take place in April 2019 at Wembley Stadium. Hearn later explained that the WBA would have granted an exemption, had Wilder signed a deal to fight Joshua.

On 5 July, Hearn announced the Wembley Stadium in London would host Joshua&#x27;s next two fights on 22 September 2018 and again on 13 April 2019. On 16 July, Joshua vs. Povetkin for the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles was officially announced for 22 September on Sky Box Office. Many British pundits and trainers spoke around how Joshua should not underestimate Povetkin and how he would pose a big threat to Joshua.

In front of nearly 80,000 in attendance, Joshua overcame a short struggle, eventually coming out with a victory in round 7 through TKO to retain his world titles. Using his movement and coming in and out, Povetkin had Joshua hurt early on with his big shots. In round 2, Joshua&#x27;s nose began to bruise. From round 5, Povetkin began to tire. Joshua dropped Povetkin with a left hand to the head in round 7. Povetkin got back up but Joshua was straight back in with a flurry of hard shots, before the referee mercifully stopped the fight. At the time of stoppage, the three judges scorecards were 58–56, 58–56, and 59–55 in favour of Joshua.

In the post-fight interview, Joshua stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve got my knockout streak back and I found my right hand again. Alexander Povetkin is a very tough challenge. He provided that, he was good with left hook. I realized he was strong to the head but weak to the body so I was switching it up. Every jab takes a breath out of you and I slowed him down.&quot; He then announced he would post a poll on Twitter asking the fans who they would like to see him fight next. Compubox Punch stats showed that Joshua landed 90 of 256 punches thrown (35%), with 53 of them landed being jabs. Povetkin landed 47 of his 181 thrown (26%). Povekin connected with 43 power shots compared to the 37 Joshua landed. There was also a huge size advantage in favour of Joshua, who weighed 246 pounds to Povetkin&#x27;s 222 pounds. It was reported that Joshua would earn around £20 million and Povetkin would earn around £6 million for the fight.

In November 2018, according to his promoter Andrei Ryanbinsky, Povetkin would retire after two more fights.

=== 2019–2021: Later career ===
By the end of December 2018, Povetkin recovered from elbow operations following his loss to Joshua and stated he would start a training camp in January 2019, hoping for a fight in April. Povetkin expected his return to the ring would take place in either the UK or US. A few names had been reported such as Dillian Whyte and Oleksandr Usyk. On 4 March, it was reported that Usyk would fight either Povetkin or Carlos Takam on 18 May 2019 in Chicago, Illinois. Two days later it was reported, whilst a potential Usyk-Povetkin fight could take place in 2019, both boxers would take interim bout first.

==== Povetkin vs. Fury ====
Povetkin scored a twelve-round unanimous decision against Hughie Fury on 31 August 2019 at The O2 Arena in London on the Vasyl Lomachenko vs. Luke Campbell undercard. All of the officials had the bout exactly the same – 117–111 for Povetkin, who turned 40 two days later.

==== Povetkin vs. Hunter ====
Povetkin faced Michael Hunter on 7 December on the undercard of Andy Ruiz Jr. vs. Anthony Joshua II built Diriyah Arena in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia. Both shared a split decision draw after twelve rounds, the first draw of each fighter&#x27;s career. In the ring following the fight, Povetkin and Hunter spoke about their desire for a rematch to settle the score.
The fight began at a furious pace as Hunter came out fast and rocked Povetkin multiple times in the first round. The two relatively small heavyweights traded hooks and did not hang around before jumping in close. Hunter&#x27;s speed continued to trouble Povetkin in the second as he wobbled the Russian again, who stood firm and refused to wilt early on. Povetkin appeared to have somewhat weathered the storm by the third and fourth rounds as Hunter&#x27;s punches had less of an effect on him and he returned fire with shots of his own. The tables turned for a moment in the fifth as Povektin rocked Hunter with a left hook. The 31-year-old staggered backwards and was seemingly kept up by the ropes, though no knockdown was given. Action died down slightly in the sixth but reignited in the seventh as both men traded in the middle of the ring and appeared to hurt one another with their respective power punches. As the bout drew deeper into the second half, the pair simply could not maintain the pace of some of their earlier exchanges and things became scrappy at times. Hunter appeared to be landing the cleaner shots, catching Povetkin as he came charging forwards before utilising his own effective aggression. By the tenth, Povetkin appeared to have expended all of his energy and in the eleventh he began to grab hold of Hunter while being repeatedly caught with right hands. Come the final session, the result seemed to be heading in the American&#x27;s favour, but his lackluster efforts in the last minutes proved to cost him as the result was read out as a split decision draw: 115–113 Povetkin, 115–113 Hunter, and 114–114 draw. Hunter said post-fight: &quot;I don&#x27;t make the scores so there&#x27;s nothing I can say on it. I think I&#x27;ve done enough, but obviously the judges didn&#x27;t think so, I hope I get the chance to fight him again.&quot; Povetkin replied: &quot;I think it was a 50/50 fight. Absolutely, I will do it again for sure.&quot;

==== Povetkin vs. Whyte ====

Povetkin was scheduled to face WBC interim heavyweight champion Dillian Whyte on 2 May 2020, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the date was pushed back to 22 August. Whyte, installed as the pre-fight betting favourite, started off well and controlled the fight in the first four rounds, knocking Povetkin down twice in the fourth. However, 30 seconds into the following round, Povetkin landed an uppercut which left Whyte laid flat on his back, prompting the referee to call a halt to the contest. With a knockout of the year contender, Povetkin was announced the winner of the bout by fifth-round knockout. According to official viewing figures, the fight accumulated 222,000 PPV buys on Sky Sports Box Office.

==== Povetkin vs. Whyte II ====
Povetkin&#x27;s first defence of his WBC interim heavyweight title consisted of an immediate rematch against Dillian Whyte in Gibraltar. The fight had originally been scheduled to take place in November 2020, but was postponed to 27 March 2021 when Povetkin contracted COVID-19. With a mainly pro-Whyte crowd of 500 fans present at the Europa Point Sports Complex, Povetkin lost the fight by way of fourth-round technical knockout, a result that saw Whyte regain the WBC interim title at Povetkin&#x27;s expense. After the fight, Russian promoter Andrey Ryabinsky said he would try to &quot;persuade him [Povetkin] to end his career&quot;, citing concerns about the fighter&#x27;s health.

=== Retirement ===
On 13 June 2021, Povetkin announced his retirement from boxing aged 41, citing lingering injuries that require treatment: &quot;The years take their toll, I have all kinds of injuries that still need to be treated. The time has come for me to end my career.&quot;

==Personal life==
Povetkin has a daughter named Arina with his ex-wife, Irina. In July 2013, Alexander married Yevgenia Merkulova in the Czech Republic. He also has a brother, Vladimir Povetkin, who fights as a professional light heavyweight. Both fighters were trained by Valery Belov.

<text>CFRA is a news/talk formatted radio station in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, owned by Bell Media. The station broadcasts on the assigned frequency of 580 kHz. CFRA&#x27;s studios are located in the Bell Media Building on George Street in Downtown Ottawa&#x27;s ByWard Market, while its 4-tower transmitter array is located near Manotick.

==History==
Frank Ryan founded the station, which began broadcasting with a 1,000-watt transmitter at 560 kHz on May 3, 1947. The first studios were located at the Ottawa Auditorium on O&#x27;Connor Street, where the station spent its first ten years. In 1962, the station moved to its current frequency of 580 kHz and increased its daytime power to 50 kW, and nighttime power to 10 kW.

After Ryan&#x27;s death in 1965, ownership of the station passed to his wife Kathleen, who subsequently sold CFRA and sister station CFMO-FM to CHUM Limited in 1968.

Between 1980 and 1984, on Saturday afternoons from 2 to 5pm, CFRA aired an oldies show hosted by American announcer and comedian Gary Owens, formerly of the &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; TV show. it was entitled Soundtrack Of The Sixties, where song requests were offered by postcard to the station as an entry towards the yearly-end prize.

CFRA played pop music until the mid-1980s as Ottawa&#x27;s leading Top 40 music station, known in the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s for its hugely popular and controversial evening host Mark Elliot. So popular was Elliot at his peak that he was tapped to be a presenter at the Juno Awards in 1985. Much of Elliot&#x27;s wildness on the air could be attributed to the fact that he was suffering from drug and alcohol addictions at the time. One of Elliot&#x27;s most eyebrow-raising behaviors came in 1986 when he quit on the air after a switch to an oldies-based format (see below) was announced. After a short time at competitor CFGO (where his addictions and erratic behaviour cost him his job), Elliot went into rehab and managed to kick his addictions; he later became the host of a talk show for people recovering from addictions on Toronto radio.

On August 18, 1986, CFRA changed formats to &quot;Favourites of Yesterday and Today,&quot; describing itself as a gold-based adult contemporary station (and mirroring a similar change from Top 40 to gold-based AC that same year at sister station CHUM in Toronto). In 1991, CFRA changed the format again to an all-oldies station, before changing to the current news/talk format in June 1993. Many believe that CJMJ-FM&#x27;s launch in 1991 (co-owned with CFRA since 1999) led to the demise of CFRA&#x27;s adult contemporary format. In 2002, CFRA&#x27;s slogan became &quot;left on the dial, right on the issues&quot;, as a tribute to its conservative talk political leanings. The current studios have been located at CHUM&#x27;s downtown Market Media Mall since 2000. In 2007, CFRA, along with the other CHUM stations, were sold to CTVglobemedia.

In January 2012, Bell Media applied to increase nighttime power to 30 kW noting that co-channel stations in Antigonish (CJFX-FM), Baie-Comeau (CHLC-FM) and Thunder Bay (CKPR-FM) have all switched to FM. On September 26, 2012, Bell Media&#x27;s application received CRTC approval to increase CFRA&#x27;s night-time power from 10 to 30 kW and by modifying its antenna pattern (improving reception towards Montreal), resulting in changes to its authorized contours. All other technical parameters would remain unchanged. CFRA would remain on 580 kHz.

==Programming==
Notable personalities include Bill Carroll and The Morning Rush producer Katherine Colbert who also does the popular What’s Trending segment.

Newsroom staff is made up of anchors/producers, Ted Raymond, Zach McGibbon, Dylan Dyson, and Sara Cimetta. Most weekday newscasts are read by CTV&#x27;s Graham Richardson, Trisha Owens, and Matt Skube.

CFRA also broadcasts syndicated talk radio shows such as Viewpoints with Todd van der Heyden overnight and on weekends. Since April 2012, the audio feed of CTV affiliate and sister television station CJOH-DT&#x27;s 6 PM newscast is simulcast on CFRA.

==Lowell Green CBSC complaints==
A complaint against Lowell Green was launched in 2008 after a provocative show on December 4, 2008 about the Muslim faith. The topic began with Green speaking about a school which had named a teddy bear Muhammad. Green then led a discussion on whether the Muslim faith was radical and violent. Lowell himself took the view that it was radical and violent at its core. The complaint to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) was launched in December 2008. The CBSC responded that no standards had been broken and there was no obligation for Green to be uncritical of the topic at hand.

The Ontario Regional Panel of the CBSC reviewed the case again after the complainant reiterated his points and did not accept the original decision. Then CBSC then decided that the December 4th Lowell Green show had violated clause 2 (Human Rights) and clause 6 (Full, Fair and Proper Presentation) of the CBSC code of ethics.

A previous complaint had been made to the CBSC in 2006 after a May 18 episode in which Green spoke about the Muslim faith and the Qur&#x27;an.

Both complaints resulted in CFRA not being obligated to agree with the complainant but to respond to the complainant in a timely and thorough manner. A response was written by the news director but ultimately, the complainant was not satisfied with the result. The complaint was then sent to the adjudicating panel of the CBSC but no further action was required.

<text>All the Real Girls is a 2003 American romantic drama film written and directed by David Gordon Green, and starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel, Shea Whigham and Patricia Clarkson. It is about the romance between a young, small-town womanizer and his best friend&#x27;s sexually inexperienced younger sister. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2003. It was well-received by critics and was nominated for several film festival awards, with Green winning a Special Jury Prize at Sundance.

==Plot==
Paul is a young womanizer who lives in a small Southern town and earns a living fixing cars for his uncle. He still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital.

Paul often hangs out with his friends: self-proclaimed partner-in-crime Tip, Bo, and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies&#x27; man, and is not known for being involved in long-term relationships; most of his romances last only a few weeks, and he has slept with nearly every girl in town.

Paul begins to reach a point where he would like to lead a different life when he meets Noel, Tip’s teenage sister who has returned home after attending boarding school. Noel is more thoughtful and mature than the girls Paul is used to. They begin a relationship in private. When Tip hears rumors of Paul and Noel being together, he furiously confronts Paul and wants to know if he is having sex with Noel. Paul refuses to answer, and when their friends try to pull them away from fighting, Tip takes out his anger by beating up another guy.

Paul continues to see Noel despite the rift with Tip. After they make out on a bed one night, Noel wants to go further but Paul stops her. He gets off the bed and tells her that he does not want to hurt her like he has hurt so many other girls. He tenderly expresses to her that he did not expect to like her so much after she returned, but he feels he can be real with her, and he is worried about what she thinks of his reputation. She tells him she is a virgin, and she trusts him.

Later, Noel asks Paul if they can spend the night in a motel. She emotionally tells him about a set of scars on her side: a few years earlier, her dad had let her drive their boat on a lake, but she was careless and ran over a boy in the water. She fell on the deck in horror and began clawing at her skin with a fishhook. Noel says she just wanted to feel pain for what she had done, and Paul comforts her. They go out swimming near the motel that night, then return to the room and make a tent with the sheets on the bed. When he returns home, Paul&#x27;s mother is waiting by her bed, disappointed because he forgot to return her car, causing her to ride her bike to a disabled child&#x27;s party tardily.

Paul later finds Tip sitting along the river in town. He asks Paul to do right by Noel, withholding his anger at how much the two of them used to sleep with women without a care. Then he reveals that he got a local girl pregnant, which has sent him on a drinking bender. Paul asks if he loves the girl, and Tip guesses he does. Meanwhile, Bust-Ass, who has an interest in Noel, starts becoming friendly with her. Noel tells Paul that she will be spending the weekend at a friend&#x27;s lake house.

When Noel returns, she has come back with a short new haircut. When Paul notices she has a hesitant air about her, she says something happened while she was away. She painfully admits she slept with another guy, and Paul is heartbroken, resulting in a breakup.

At the bar one night, a drunken Paul sees Noel come in with Bust-Ass. They are just friends, but the sight of them together incenses Paul and he causes a scene. Noel is annoyed with Paul’s behavior, but after he apologizes she takes him back to her place and they have sex.

Some time later, Paul and Noel are no longer seeing each other but remain on friendly terms. Paul still has some lingering heartache over his first love, but has emerged out of the relationship a better person thanks to Noel and tries to move on.

==Production==
===Development===
Feeling unseen by the romance films released at the time, David Gordon Green and Paul Schneider conceived and began writing &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; during the late 90s. Green sought to make a film that was both &quot;contemporary&quot; and &quot;how it feels when you get your gut in a knot&quot;. After working on &quot;George Washington&quot;, Green had several projects he intended to pursue, including a science fiction film and a western film. However, when funding failed to come through for either project, Green got a job at a doorknob factory before turning back to &quot;All the Real Girls&quot;, a movie he felt &quot;obligated&quot; to make while in his youth and &quot;while these feelings were still fresh and these wounds were still bleeding&quot;. Before partnering with Jean Doumanian and Lisa Muskat, a studio had offered Green a larger budget to produce the film. Green would pass due to the studio wanting to cast Freddie Prinze Jr. instead of Schneider.

===Pre-production===
The crew for &quot;All the Real Girls&quot; was mostly the same as that of &quot;George Washington&quot;, most members of which were colleagues from University of North Carolina School of the Arts. Schneider, whose background was mostly in editing, takes on the film&#x27;s leading role. Feeling closely related to the character of Paul, he said, &quot;All you need to do is to have grown up in North Carolina and had your heart broken, and you&#x27;re good to go.&quot; For the character of Noel, Green and Schneider strived to get the casting &quot;right&quot;. Zooey Deschanel was cast, after Green and Schneider felt she embodied how they envisioned the character, and for elevating the material they had written for her. Danny McBride, who served as a second unit director on &quot;George Washington&quot;, was cast in the supporting role in his acting debut in this film.

===Filming===
Principal photography for the film was underway in the fall of 2001 in Marshall and Asheville, North Carolina. During production, Green allowed the actors to take scenes in different directions from where the script initially went. This led to the film to take on a new &quot;life of its own&quot;. Green also felt to stray away from genre cliches and scenes that had largely been done before. Instead he opted to focus on &quot;unique magical moments&quot;. These decisions resulted in the first forty pages of the script being discarded from the final film, including a scene where Paul and Noel meet for the first time.

==Reception==
=== Box office ===

&quot;All the Real Girls&quot; was given a limited release on February 14, 2003. It played in six theaters, bringing in $39,714 in its opening weekend. It grossed $579,986 on a $1 million budget.

=== Critical response ===
The film received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 71%, based on 115 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Has enough honest moments to warrant a look.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a score of 71 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot; said “Green is 27, old enough to be jaded, but he has the soul of a romantic poet. Wordsworth, after all, was 36 when he published, ‘The Rainbow comes and goes and lovely as the Rose.’ How many guys that age would have that kind of nerve today?” He gave the film a four out of four star rating.

=== Awards and nominations ===

The film was nominated for awards at several different film festivals globally. Green was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and ended up winning the Special Jury Prize for Emotional Truth, as did Patricia Clarkson for Outstanding Performance. Zooey Deschanel was nominated for Best Female Lead at the 2004 Independent Spirit Awards and Best Actress at the 2004 Mar del Plata Film Festival.

<text>The Montreal Crystals (&quot;Crystal Hockey Club&quot;) were an ice hockey team based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada that existed from 1884 to 1895. One of the first established ice hockey teams, the Crystals played various challenges against other clubs in the early days of ice hockey competition. They won the Canadian championship in 1886, defeating Quebec, which withdrew due to numerous injuries in the final game. Later that year the Crystals helped to found the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada where they played the first five seasons. The club won the championship in 1887, defeating the Montreal Victorias in the last challenge of the season. The team played further challenges for the championship from 1888 to 1891. 
For the 1890 season, the club became known as the Montreal Dominions (&quot;Dominion Hockey Club&quot;). In 1891 they became known as the Montreal Crescents (&quot;Crescent Hockey Club&quot;). The team sat out the 1892 season. In 1893 they returned to the league and returned to their original name of Montreal Crystals.

In February 1895, the Crystals were purchased by the &quot;Shamrocks Amateur Athletic Association&quot;, and were merged into the dormant Montreal Shamrocks Hockey Club, who were then revived replacing the Crystals in the AHAC.

The club took their various names from the rinks they played in. The Crystal Palace Skating Rink from 1884–1889. &quot;The Dominion Rink&quot; in 1890, and the &quot;Crescent Skating Rink&quot; in 1891. When the team moved to the Victoria Skating Rink in 1893, they reverted to their original name of Montreal Crystals, since they were unable to use the Victoria name because of the Montreal Victorias.

==Junior teams==

Outside of the senior club, the Montreal Crystals had two lower-tier teams as well.
A junior team called the Montreal Jr Crystals (&quot;Junior Crystals Hockey Club&quot;) debuted in 1887 in the JAHAC (Junior Amateur Hockey Association of Canada) and played until 1895 (with the exceptions of the 1890 and 1892 seasons).
In 1894, an intermediate version of the Montreal Crystals played in the IAHAC (Intermediate Amateur Hockey Association of Canada). This team only played that one season.

<doc id="944965" wikidata="Q7241482" url="?curid=944965" title="National security directive">
<text>National security directives are presidential directives issued for the National Security Council (NSC). Starting with Harry Truman, every president since the founding of the National Security Council in 1947 has issued national security directives in one form or another, which have involved foreign, military and domestic policies. National security directives are generally highly classified and are available to the public only after &quot;a great many years&quot; have elapsed. Unlike executive orders, national security directives are usually directed only to the National Security Council and the most senior executive branch officials, and embody foreign and military policy-making guidance rather than specific instructions.

==Names for national security directives by administration==
Presidents have issued such directives under various names.
===Truman and Eisenhower administrations===
National security directives were quite different in the early period of the Cold War. A 1988 General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation into national security directives left out the directives from the Truman and Eisenhower years because &quot;they were not structured in a way to allow categorization.&quot; The study nevertheless made note of two types of directives. The first was &quot;policy papers&quot; which &quot;could&quot; contain policy recommendations, in which case the president might decide to approve the policy by writing his signature. A famous example of such a policy paper is NSC 68. GAO also noted another type of directive called &quot;NSC Actions&quot;, which were &quot;numbered records of decisions that were reached at NSC meetings.

===Kennedy and Johnson administrations===
The Kennedy administration which took office in 1961 reorganized the NSC and began issuing National Security Action Memoranda (NSAMs). Many NSAMs were signed in Kennedy&#x27;s name by National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, although Kennedy sometimes signed them personally. Lyndon B. Johnson continued issuing NSAMs where Kennedy left off, although issuing only 99 directives as compared to Kennedy&#x27;s 273.

===Reagan administration===
A 1986 National Security Decision Directive gave the State Department authority and responsibility to coordinate responses to international terrorism across government agencies including the CIA, DoD, and FBI. This was intended to reduce interagency conflicts which were observed in the response to the hijacking of the &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; cruise ship. The State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Counterterrorism continues this coordinating function.

== Homeland Security Presidential Directive ==
After September 11, 2001, George W. Bush issued Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPDs), with the consent of the Homeland Security Council. These directives were sometimes issued concurrently as national security directives.

== Secrecy ==
Regarding the secrecy of presidential directives, Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists&#x27; Project on Government Secrecy stated in February 2008 that:

Of the 54 National Security Presidential Directives issued by the (George W.) Bush Administration to date, the titles of only about half have been publicly identified. There is descriptive material or actual text in the public domain for only about a third. In other words, there are dozens of undisclosed Presidential directives that define U.S. national security policy and task government agencies, but whose substance is unknown either to the public or, as a rule, to Congress.
However, in an unprecedented development, the first Trump administration ordered their national security directives to be published in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;.

<text>[[Zimbabwe]] competed at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s seventh consecutive appearance at the Olympics, after gaining its independence from the former Rhodesia.

The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC) sent a total of twelve athletes, nine men and three women, competing only in athletics, shooting, swimming, and tennis. They marched in the middle of the parade of nations as the 53rd nation due to the use of the Greek alphabet, instead of the penultimate position, just before the host nation, as it has usually been placed. Notable athletes featured tennis siblings Cara (women&#x27;s singles) and Wayne Black (men&#x27;s doubles), and sprinters Brian Dzingai and Young Talkmore Nyongani, who became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Zimbabwe left Athens with a full set of three Olympic medals for the first time in history since the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. This full set was officially awarded to swimmer Kirsty Coventry, who took home the gold in the 200 m backstroke, silver in the 100 m backstroke, and bronze in the 200 m individual medley.

==Medalists==
==Athletics==

Zimbabwean athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<text>Uruguay competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its full support to the United States boycott.

The Uruguayan Olympic Committee (, &quot;COU&quot;) sent a total of 15 athletes to the Games, 13 men and 2 women, to compete in 6 different sports. Four athletes from the Uruguayan team had previously competed in Sydney, including track cyclist Milton Wynants, who won the bronze in the men&#x27;s points race, and backstroke swimmer Serrana Fernández, who later carried the nation&#x27;s flag in the opening ceremony.

<doc id="944987" wikidata="Q1871280" url="?curid=944987" title="Lotus Éclat">
<text>The Lotus Éclat (Type 76 and Type 84) is a sports car built from 1975 to 1982 by British automobile manufacturer Lotus Cars. It was based on the Elite but had a fastback body style which offered more practicality with storage in the boot, albeit with less headroom above the rear seats. The car was initially to be called the &quot;Elite Coupe&quot;. The lower half of the fibreglass bodywork was identical to that of the Elite.

==Description and history==
The Éclat Series 1 (1975–1980) was announced in October 1975. It used a Lotus 907 Inline-4 engine. Later cars (1980–1982) used a larger Lotus 912 engine, however, because of emission regulations modifications the power output remained the same as the early engine. It did, however, produce more torque and thus improved the car&#x27;s performance. Both were versions of the 900 engine series.

Early cars either had a four speed Ford gearbox or the five speed gearbox derived by Lotus from Austin Maxi components. Later cars used a Getrag five speed gearbox. A three-speed automatic gearbox was optional. The Éclat had disc brakes at the front, and inboard drum brakes at the rear. Air conditioning and power steering were offered as options. The different equipments of the Series 1 cars were called 520, 521, 522, 523, and 524. The 520 has a four-speed transmission, a Ford bolt pattern, steel wheels, and smaller brakes. The remainder of the range have a 114.3 mm bolt pattern, the same disc brakes as the Elite, and GKN alloy wheels. They also received a twin exhaust and various other comfort items such as a clock and a cigar lighter. The 522 added power steering and the 523 also received air conditioning. The 524 is like the 523 but with the automatic transmission. Some other cars were also fitted with the automatic, and Lotus accommodated a variety of changes to the cars. There were also sporty versions of the 520 and 521 called the Eclat Sprint, with a black-and-white paint job, an oil cooler, and a variety of other performance upgrades. Approximately 1,500 examples of the Eclat were produced.

===Chassis===
The original mild steel chassis fitted by Lotus had a strip of felt fitted between body and the steel crossmember of the chassis. In damp climates, the felt became a water trap and caused structural corrosion, resulting in a crumbling of the chassis from the rear. Chassis replacement was initially not cost effective on the Eclat and Elite, and in consequence resale values suffered. Series 2 cars were fitted with a galvanised chassis as standard and a large number of Series 1 vehicles have had replacements fitted, which are usually galvanised.

==Reception==
The car was well received by the motoring press, which praised the car&#x27;s handling and grip. The fuel consumption was also considered reasonable at the time, in comparison with the larger and multi cylinder engines used in competitor GT cars.

==Éclat Riviera==
In 1981 Lotus introduced the Type 84, called the Lotus Éclat S 2.2 Riviera. This model, which was available for two years, came with a removable roof panel, vinyl roof, vented bonnet and a rear spoiler. Production totaled 73 units out of the 223 series 2.2 eclats.

==Éclat Excel==
In 1982, the Éclat was developed into the Éclat Excel (later badged simply as the Lotus Excel), which used the same engine, but a modified version of the chassis, altered bodywork, a Toyota gearbox, driveline, and brakes.

<doc id="944992" wikidata="Q384831" url="?curid=944992" title="Slovakia men's national ice hockey team">
<text>The Slovakia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of Slovakia and is controlled by the Slovak Ice Hockey Federation. A successor to the Czechoslovakia national team, it is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in the world. The team&#x27;s general manager is Miroslav Šatan and their head coach is Craig Ramsay.

Slovakia has won four medals at the World Championships, including a gold medal in 2002 in Sweden and a bronze medal at the 2022 Winter Olympics.

==History==
The Slovak national team was formed following the breakup of Czechoslovakia, as the country was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Although the Czechs were allowed to compete in the highest pool (A), the IIHF ruled that because fewer players of the former Czechoslovak team were Slovaks, Slovakia would be required to start international play in pool C. However, Slovakia&#x27;s play in the lower pools won back-to-back promotions to pool A by 1996.

Slovakia&#x27;s first appearance in an elite ice hockey competition was at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. With a lineup led by star Peter Šťastný, the Slovaks finished first in their group with three wins and two ties before losing to Russia in overtime in the quarterfinals. In the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano and 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the Slovak team did not use its National Hockey League (NHL) players in the preliminary round due to a scheduling conflict. This affected all of the smaller countries, but devastated the Slovaks as most of their best players were from NHL teams. The NHL only shut down its schedule in time for the second group stage, and thus Slovakia failed to qualify among the final eight teams both times. This turn of events was troubling to the entire hockey community, and the rules were changed for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy.

Following the successful years for the Slovaks in the early 2000s at the World Championships, when they won the silver in St. Petersburg at the 2000 edition after a loss to the Czechs, winning the only title so far in Goteburg at the 2002 edition and securing bronze in Helsinki (2003), the results of Slovakia worsened and Slovakia began to drop out in the quarterfinals. The closest Slovakia came to relegation into Division I was in 2008, when they avoided relegation only thanks to two victories over Slovenia in the Relegation Round. These were followed by three subsequent eliminations in the qualifying round (round of 12), including one at a 2011 edition Slovakia hosted in Bratislava and Košice for the first time since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.

However, Slovakia unexpectedly received silver medal at the 2012 edition, again won in Helsinki. This was the first tournament after the introduction of the new tournament format, followed by the quarterfinals. Due to the surprise this medal was after a number of unsuccessful tournaments, it was regarded as with a value of a triumphal gold. Moreover, the following year, Slovakia failed to repeat medal successes again or even qualify for the quarterfinals, except 2013.

In the following years, the team narrowly missed out on a quarterfinal spot for three consecutive years. In 2017, Slovakia recorded its worst tournament in history by placing 14th, narrowly escaping elimination thanks to an overtime victory against Italy. After the unsuccessful World Championships, Craig Ramsay was appointed as the head coach with the goal of improving the results and playstyle of the national team. Despite missing out on the quarterfinals again in 2018 in Denmark and one year later on home ice, the overall appearance of the team looked much better than the years prior.

In the Winter Olympic Games, Slovakia&#x27;s highest achievement prior to 2022 was fourth place in Vancouver 2010. In the tournament, it won against favourites Russia and Sweden, and lost against Canada in the semi-finals and against Finland in the bronze medal game. In 2022, the Slovaks claimed their first ever Olympic medal after defeating Sweden 4–0 in a bronze medal game.

<text>The Victoria Hockey Club of Montreal, Quebec, Canada was an early men&#x27;s amateur ice hockey club. Its date of origin is ascribed to either 1874, 1877 or 1881, making it either the first or second organized ice hockey club after McGill University. The club played at its own rink, the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal. The club was winners of the Stanley Cup in 1895 and held it until 1899, except for a period in 1896. The club remained amateur, splitting from the ranks of teams turned professional in 1908. The club was the first winner of the Allan Cup and continued to play until 1939, when it folded after its 65th season. The club often also fielded junior and intermediate teams.

==Team history==
Interest in ice hockey at the Victoria Skating Club in Montreal, dates to at least 1874, and is attributed to the efforts of James Creighton then a judge of skating at the club, in organizing his friends to play on the rink with sticks and skates from his home province of Nova Scotia. In 1875, the first recorded organized hockey game took place at its rink, the Victoria Skating Rink, which had opened in 1862, between skating club members and McGill University students. Until 1883, there was only exhibition matches against other teams in Montreal. Tournaments would begin in 1883 at the Montreal Winter Carnival.

On January 10, 1882, the Victoria Hockey Club held what was described as its &#x27;first annual meeting&#x27;, whereby it elected its president James G. Monk. Other directors included George W. Gardner as vice-president, secretary-treasurer was Charles Lamothe. Hockey was played with both balls and pucks during this period. According to McGill hockey club member W. L. Murray, by 1881 it was normally played with a square puck, made by slicing a rubber ball. According to Murray, the Victoria club of the 1880s is credited with eliminating the square edges and playing with a round puck.

In 1886, the club helped to found the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC). The team played in this league from 1887–1898. It was during this period that the team had its greatest success, winning the Stanley Cup in 1895, December 1896, 1897, 1898 and February 1899. They also won the AHAC league in 1895, 1896, 1897 and 1898. In 1894, the team participated in the first Stanley Cup playoff, losing 3–2 to Montreal in the semi-final.

The team resigned from the AHAC in 1898 over the proposal to allow the Ottawa Capitals into the league, and helped form the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL) in which they played from 1899–1905. The CAHL itself folded in 1905 and the team helped found the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association. The league allowed amateurs and professionals to play against each other openly. The Victorias played in the league for two years as a purely amateur team leaving the ECAHA after the 1908 season to focus on amateur play.

In 1908, the new Allan Cup was awarded to the Victorias as the top amateur team at the time. The Victorias remained active in senior-league amateur play in the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union until 1913. From 1913–1923, the club was a member of the Montreal City Hockey League. The club then joined the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey League. Later the team played in the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association.

In 1924, as a part of a 50th anniversary, the Victorias played an exhibition match against the Parkdale Canoe Club of Toronto at the then-new Montreal Forum. The game was the first amateur ice hockey game at the new venue. The game was held on December 13, 1924 and was a fund-raising event for the Club. The Victoria Skating Rink was closed in 1925 and the Victorias moved to Mount Royal Arena and the Forum.

In 1927, the Victorias became the first North American club team to tour in Europe. In Stockholm, Sweden, the club played exhibition games against an all-Sweden team, winning 17–1. Next, the Victorias defeated IK Göta 5–0, Djurgårdens IF 6–2, Södertälje SK 6–0 and IK Göta again 19–3. The team next played in Södertälje, defeating Södertälje IF 8–1. The club then played in Berlin, Germany, defeating an all-Czechoslovakia team 8–0 and Berliner SC 13–0. The team then moved to Vienna, Austria, where it defeated Wiener EV 8–0 and 7–0. In Milan, Italy, the club defeated a combined team of HC Davos and EHC St. Moritz 18–0 and defeating HC Milano 15–2. In Davos, Switzerland, the team played Davos again, winning 9–0. The final stop on the tour was London, England, where the Victorias defeated an all-England side 14–1.

The club was an Allan Cup finalist in 1928, losing to the University of Manitoba team.

The Victoria Hockey Club ceased activities in 1939.

===Logo and uniforms===
The team&#x27;s logo was that of the Victoria Skating Club, a yellow or white &#x27;V&#x27; in cursive. The team&#x27;s sweaters were maroon in colour, and the team was sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Maroons&quot; by the Montreal Gazette in its reporting.

==Season by season record==
Except for 1887–88, season play prior to 1892–93 was arranged in challenges. The Victorias also participated in exhibitions or tournaments.

<text>Gauge is an American pornographic actor and feature dancer.

==Career==
After having appeared in about 140 movies, Gauge left the pornographic film industry in 2005 due to a contract dispute with her management company. She was certified as a surgical technologist, but she reported that she was often turned down for jobs because of her adult film career. She retrained as a makeup artist, but suffered similar issues.

While Gauge was studying to become a surgical technician, an anesthesia student recognized her as a pornographic actor, word spread among the staff and, when she was set to graduate, no one would sign off on her required hours. Later, while working at a hospital, her boss sexually harassed her and the hospital&#x27;s complaints department did not believe her so she resigned.

<doc id="945024" wikidata="Q1004175" url="?curid=945024" title="Groupe Bull">
<text>Bull SAS (also known as Groupe Bull, Bull Information Systems, or simply Bull) is a French computer company headquartered in Les Clayes-sous-Bois, in the western suburbs of Paris. The company has also been known at various times as Bull General Electric, Honeywell Bull, CII Honeywell Bull, and Bull HN. Bull was founded in 1931, as H.W. Egli - Bull, to capitalize on the punched card technology patents of Norwegian engineer Fredrik Rosing Bull (1882–1925). After a reorganization in 1933, with new investors coming in, the name was changed to Compagnie des Machines Bull (CMB). Bull has a worldwide presence in more than 100 countries and is particularly active in the defense, finance, health care, manufacturing, public, and telecommunication sectors.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

On 31 July 1919, Norwegian engineer Fredrik Rosing Bull filed a patent for a &quot;combined sorter-recorder-tabulator of punch cards&quot; machine that he had developed with financing from the Norwegian insurance company Storebrand. Storebrand integrated his device into its operations in 1921. The following year Bull sold his second machine to the Danish insurer Hafnia who had learned of the technology through an article in an insurance trade magazine. At the time of Bull&#x27;s death from cancer in 1925 at the age of 43, a dozen of his machines had been sold to different companies throughout Europe. The commercial and technical development of the machines continued under the direction of Bull&#x27;s childhood friend and long-time collaborator Reidar Knutsen along with his brother Kurt Andréas Knutsen.

As the business grew, several outside investors were brought in, leading to the incorporation of the company H.W. Egli Bull in 1931. In 1933, more investors joined and the company changed its name to Compagnie des Machines Bull, a name it would keep until 1964.

=== Growth ===
The company has undergone many takeovers and mergers since its formation. In particular, it has had various ownership relations with General Electric, Honeywell, and NEC from the 1960s through the 1980s; and with Motorola, Debeka, and France Télécom more recently. It acquired Honeywell Information Systems in the late 1980s, and later also had a share of Zenith Data Systems and Packard Bell. Bull was nationalised in 1982 and was merged with most of the rest of the French computer industry.

Groupe Bull bought Zenith Electronics in late December 1989. It kept Zenith Data Systems&#x27; headquarters and plants in Chicago and St. Joseph, Michigan. In 1993 the French Government initiated the process of privatization, which was completed in the period 1995-97 when the company was re-privatised.

In August 2014, the French IT company Atos announced that it had acquired a controlling stake in Bull SA through a tender offer launched in May. Atos announced plans in October, 2014 to buy out or squeeze out the remaining share and bondholders.

Bull launched the Hoox m2, the first integrally secured European smartphone, which in June 2014 was approved for use with data classified as &quot;Restricted Information&quot; (&quot;Diffusion Restreinte&quot;) by the Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d&#x27;information (ANSSI). The Hoox range of secure mobiles and smartphones ensures confidentiality of voice, SMS, e-mail and data communication.

==Amesys controversy==

Amesys, a Groupe Bull subsidiary specializing in defense and aerospace-related systems and software, became embroiled in controversy in 2011 when it was revealed that it had sold an internet monitoring system to the Muammar Gaddafi regime of Libya in 2007. The &quot;Eagle System&quot; was used by the Gaddafi regime to spy on citizens and foreign journalists. On 12 March 2013 Reporters Without Borders named Amesys as one of five &quot;Corporate Enemies of the Internet&quot; and &quot;digital era mercenaries&quot; for selling products that have been or are being used by governments to violate human rights and freedom of information. A judicial inquiry was opened by the French government in May 2012 following allegations of complicity in torture by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). In March 2012 Groupe Bull divested itself of the Eagle System, selling it for 4 million euros to Nexa Technologies, a company run by a former Amesys CEO.

<doc id="945029" wikidata="Q1141746" url="?curid=945029" title="Analyze This">
<text>Analyze This is a 1999 American crime comedy film directed by Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Kenneth Lonergan and Peter Tolan. The plot follows a crisis-stricken mafioso (Robert De Niro) who solicits the assistance of a reluctant psychiatrist (Billy Crystal).

&quot;Analyze This&quot; was given a wide release by Warner Bros. Pictures and Roadshow Entertainment on March 5, 1999, grossing $176.9 million worldwide, and received positive reviews. Due to its success, it was followed by the sequel &quot;Analyze That&quot; in 2002.

==Plot==
Mob boss Paul Vitti and his &quot;consigliere&quot; Manetta are discussing an upcoming meeting and the Mafia&#x27;s present-day problems over lunch. Just as Manetta warns Paul to look out for Primo Sindone (an up-and-coming mafioso who wants to be &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;), gunmen drive past and kill Manetta.

Psychiatrist Ben Sobel is disillusioned with his life: his son from his first marriage spies on his sessions, his patients are not challenging enough, and his wedding to Laura MacNamara is upcoming. Ben accidentally rear-ends a car belonging to Paul, and the trunk opens, revealing a hostage bound and gagged inside, which Ben and his son overlook. Jelly, one of Paul&#x27;s men, takes the blame, but Ben gives Jelly his business card if he changes his mind regarding compensation.

During a meeting, Paul has a panic attack and tells Jelly that he needs to see a psychiatrist, but it has to be kept a secret. Jelly recommends Ben. Paul visits Ben, claiming his friend needs therapy, but Ben deduces his lie. As he realizes Paul is talking about himself, it impresses Paul enough to want to see him permanently, to Ben&#x27;s chagrin. Ben flies to Miami for his wedding and Paul, Jelly, and the crew follow him. Paul explains he has been suffering from erectile dysfunction, and Ben suggests the source of the problem might be stress.

The next day, Paul has another panic attack and demands to see Ben. Paul explains his history with his father to him, who thinks this might have something to do with Paul&#x27;s anxiety. The wedding is interrupted when an assassin is killed by Jelly. Ben confronts Paul and causes him to lose his temper. Ben suggests he resolve his anger by calling Primo and telling him how he feels. Paul then phones Primo and threatens to kill him if he makes one more murder attempt on Paul.

Ben and his family return to New York, where they discover a fountain in their garden, a gift from Paul. The FBI arrive and request Ben inform on Paul, but he refuses despite the FBI&#x27;s threats. He changes his mind when the FBI play a tape in which Paul reveals his intention to kill Ben after the meeting (which the FBI had doctored: Paul was actually saying he would kill anyone who harmed Ben).

At his next meet-up with Paul, Ben wears a wire, but discards it when he learns that, as a child, Paul witnessed his father being murdered. Paul, informed that Ben was working with the FBI, takes him to a secluded place to kill him. They get into a heated argument, and Paul begins sobbing as he admits that he blames himself for his father&#x27;s death. Just then, two hitmen arrive to kill Paul, but Jelly kills them both. Paul apologizes for planning to kill Ben, and the two go their separate ways.

The day of the meeting arrives, but Paul has a severe emotional breakdown. Jelly interrupts Ben&#x27;s wedding, requesting Ben attend the meeting as Paul&#x27;s &quot;consigliere&quot;. Ben is nervous at first, but eventually grows into his role and ends up offending Primo so much that he pulls a gun at Ben. Paul arrives, orders Primo to stand down, and announces he knows a traitor in his own family killed Dominic but will not seek revenge as he instead will retire from the Mafia. Outside, a standoff ensues between Paul&#x27;s and Primo&#x27;s men, during which Ben sacrifices himself for Paul. The FBI intervenes, the mobsters are arrested, and Ben is taken to the hospital.

Ben visits Paul in prison, and Paul thanks Ben for his help before informing him that Primo is dead. At home, Ben dances with his new wife as Tony Bennett serenades them.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Analyze This&quot; was co-produced and co-financed by the American Warner Bros. and the Australian Roadshow Entertainment.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Analyze This&quot; opened in 2,518 theaters and earned an average of $7,017 per location, for an estimated $18 million opening, putting it at number 1 at the box office for that weekend; it exceeded the $13 million debut of Crystal&#x27;s &quot;City Slickers&quot; in 1991. It would also break &quot;Ronin&quot;″s record for having the largest opening weekend for a Robert De Niro film. The film held this record until the release of &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; in October 2000. The opening weekend audience skewed older, with 75% over the age of 25, and audience demographics being 54% female to 46% male. The film went on to earn $107 million at the domestic box office and a further $70 million at the international box office, for a worldwide total of $177 million.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 69% from 107 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;&quot;Analyze This&quot; is a satisfying comedy with great performances by De Niro and Crystal.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A-.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, saying the film would be thought of in terms of the two leads, but also praised Joe Viterelli for his subtle performance that holds the film together. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s review highlighted the film as a &quot; sometimes funny situation comedy in which the mechanics of the situation eventually overwhelm the comedy.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, David Hunter stated that &quot;Analyze This has multiple personalities and hits the audience with a few fresh jokes but far too many 1970s mafia movie cliches&quot; and found the performances in the film lacking, with both De Niro and Crystal not fully realizing the comic potential of the premise and certain moments falling short of authenticity. Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; described the comedy as &quot;heavy&quot; and the use of the actors as &quot;lazy and cliched&quot;.

&quot;Analyze This&quot; drew several comparisons by journalists to the mafia show &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, which had premiered two months earlier in January, due to its plot about mobster Tony Soprano seeing a psychiatrist after suffering a panic attack. The film is also mentioned in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist&#x27;s Office...&quot;

<text>Phlomis is a genus of over 100 species of herbaceous plants, subshrubs and shrubs in the mint family Lamiaceae, native from the Mediterranean region east across central Asia to China.

The name &quot;Phlomis&quot; derives from a Greek word for &quot;flame&quot;, and may refer to the leaves&#x27; use in ancient times as lamp wicks. Common names include Jerusalem sage and lampwick plant.

== Description ==
The overall size varies between species from 30 cm tall up to 2 m tall (12–79 in). The leaves are entire, opposite and decussate (each leaf pair at right angles to the next) and rugose or reticulate veined. The bracts (floral leaves) are similar or different from the lower leaves. All parts are frequently covered with hairs. The bracteoles are ovate, lanceolate or linear. The flowers are arranged in whorls called verticillasters which encircle the stems. The stems are usually square in section with rounded corners, although tomentum on the stems can make them appear circular. The colour of the flowers varies from yellow to pink, purple and white. The calyx is tubular or campanulate with five or ten veins visible. Five teeth, either all equal or with the outer two longer than the others. The upper lip is hood shaped and laterally compressed (&quot;P. tuberosa&quot;, however, has an uncompressed lip with a dense bearded edge). The lower lip is &quot;trifid&quot;, the central lobe being larger than the lateral ones. There are four stamens ascending under the upper lip. Anther with forked end, the upper fork being shorter than the lower. The fruits are four three-sided nutlets, and sometimes topped with hair, sometimes glabrous. The root system can be very extensive; roots of 6-week-old seedlings have been measured at 0.7 m.

&quot;Phlomis&quot; species are the only host plants of the moths &quot;Coleophora phlomidella&quot; and &quot;C. phlomidis&quot;.

<doc id="945031" wikidata="Q5273032" url="?curid=945031" title="Dick Hubbard">
<text>Richard John Hubbard (born 18 November 1946) is a New Zealand businessman and politician, founder and former principal of Hubbard Foods in Auckland, and mayor of Auckland City from 2004 to 2007. He was elected mayor of Auckland City on 9 October 2004, succeeding John Banks, who in turn succeeded Hubbard as mayor on 13 October 2007.

==Early life and family==
Born in Paeroa on 18 December 1946, Hubbard is the son of Colin Hubbard and Margaret Hubbard (née Syme). He was educated at Paeroa College from 1960 to 1964, and then studied at Massey University from 1965 to 1969, graduating with a Bachelor of Technology (Food).

In 1970 Hubbard married Diana Reader, and the couple went on to have two children, including the transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard.

==Business interests==
Hubbard is the founder of Hubbard Foods. His management of Hubbard Foods gained some prominence for its participation in and promotion of socially responsible business perspectives. Hubbard also spent a few years managing the Food Processing Factory in Niue, processing mainly lime, passionfruit and papaya. He was the principal until he sold the business in 2018 to Harry and Graeme Hart.

Hubbard founded New Zealand Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR) (now the Sustainable Business Network) and became chairman of the New Zealand National Parks &amp; Conservation Foundation. He has been a supporter of Outward Bound in New Zealand.

==Mayoral term==
Hubbard was elected as part of a broad swing to the centre-left in the 2004 Auckland City local government elections, predicated on concerns about the style of the previous mayor, and proposals to construct a major new multi-laned road through the city&#x27;s relatively affluent eastern suburbs. Although formally independent, Hubbard&#x27;s support on Auckland&#x27;s council was derived from the centre-left leaning City Vision, Labour, and Action Hobson tickets.

===Re-election bid, 2007===

Hubbard was defeated by John Banks in the 2007 local body elections, by a margin of 10,000 votes. Hubbard won 35,314 of the votes compared to Bank&#x27;s 45,387 votes in an election marked by low voter turn-out.

==Political positions==
Hubbard endorsed the Labour Party prior to the 2017 general election, appearing in a series of promotional videos and donating $15,000 to the campaign. He stated that he regarded himself as a swing voter and had voted for both National and Labour previously, but was &quot;very concerned about our slow progress on climate&quot; under the incumbent government. Hubbard donated $100,000 to the Labour Party in May 2023.

==Honours and awards==
In 1984 Hubbard was elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Food Science and Technology. Hubbard was conferred an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Massey University in 1999. In the 2001 New Year Honours, he was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to business and the community.

<text>Adventure Comics is an American comic book series published by DC Comics from 1938 to 1983 and revived from 2009 to 2011. In its first era, the series ran for 503 issues (472 of those after the title changed from &quot;New Adventure Comics&quot;), making it the fifth-longest-running DC series, behind &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Batman&quot;. The series was revived in 2009 through a new &quot;#1&quot; issue by artist Clayton Henry and writer Geoff Johns. It returned to its original numbering with #516 (September 2010). The series ended again with #529 (October 2011) prior to a company-wide revision of DC&#x27;s superhero comic book line, known as &quot;The New 52&quot;.

==Publication history==

&quot;Adventure Comics&quot; began its nearly 50-year run in December 1935 under the title New Comics, which was only the second comic book series published by National Allied Publications, now DC Comics. The series was retitled New Adventure Comics with its 12th issue in January 1937. Issue #32 (November 1938) saw the title changed again to &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, which would remain the book&#x27;s name for the duration of its existence.
Originally a humor comic, it evolved into a serious adventure series. In issue #12, while the series was briefly re-titled &quot;New Adventure Comics&quot;, Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel introduced the first version of the character Jor-L as a science fiction detective in the far future; the character would eventually become the alien father of Superman, although the first Superman story, in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, would not appear until more than a year after Jor-L&#x27;s first appearance. The series&#x27; focus gradually shifted to superhero stories starting with the debut of the Sandman in issue #40. Other superheroes who appeared in the early days of &quot;Adventure&quot; included Hourman (from #48 to #83); Starman created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Jack Burnley in issue #61 (April 1941) (#61–102); and Joe Simon and Jack Kirby&#x27;s Manhunter replacing a similarly named business-suited investigator beginning with #73 (April 1942) until #92.

A pivotal issue of the series was #103 (April 1946), when Superboy, Green Arrow, Johnny Quick, and Aquaman moved to the series from their previous home in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot;, which was itself converted to a humor format. Starman&#x27;s and Sandman&#x27;s series were canceled to make room for the new features, while Genius Jones moved to the comic the new arrivals had just vacated. Superboy became the star of the book, and would appear on each cover into 1969 (counting Superman on the covers of issues #354–355). Superboy&#x27;s popularity in &quot;Adventure&quot; resulted in the character receiving his own title in 1949, when superhero titles in general were losing popularity. Krypto the Superdog debuted in issue #210 (March 1955) in a story by Otto Binder and Curt Swan.

In issue #247 (April 1958), by Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, Superboy met the Legion of Super-Heroes, a team of super-powered teens from the future. The group became popular, and would replace &quot;Tales of the Bizarro World&quot; as the &quot;Adventure&quot; backup feature with #300, and soon be promoted to its lead. Lightning Lad, one of the Legion&#x27;s founding members, was killed in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #304 (January 1963) and revived in issue #312. Issue #260 (May 1959) saw the first Silver Age appearance of Aquaman. In &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #346 (July 1966), Jim Shooter, 14 years old at the time, wrote his first Legion story. Shooter wrote the story in which Ferro Lad died – the first &quot;real&quot; death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before) – and introduced the Fatal Five. The Legion feature lasted until issue #380. With the next issue, Supergirl migrated from the backup slot in &quot;Action Comics&quot; to the starring feature in &quot;Adventure&quot; and ran until issue #424. The series reached its 400th issue in December 1970 and featured a Supergirl story written and drawn by Mike Sekowsky.

As of #425 (December 1972), the book&#x27;s theme changed from superhero adventure to fantasy/supernatural adventure. That issue debuted one new feature along with three non-series stories, the pirate saga &quot;Captain Fear&quot;. The next edition added a semi-anthology series, &quot;The Adventurers&#x27; Club&quot;. Soon, editor Joe Orlando was trying out horror-tinged costumed heroes such as the Black Orchid, and then the Spectre. Before long, conventional superheroes returned to the book, beginning behind the Spectre, first a three-issue run of Aquaman (issues #435–437, an early assignment for Mike Grell) and then a newly drawn 1940s Seven Soldiers of Victory script (issues #438–443). Aquaman was promoted to lead (issues #441–452), and backing him up were three-part story arcs featuring the Creeper (#445–447), the Martian Manhunter (#449–451), bracketed by issue-length Aquaman leads. He was awarded his own title and Superboy (#453–458) took over &quot;Adventure&quot; with Aqualad (#453–455) and Eclipso (#457–458) backups. Following this was a run as a Dollar Comic format giant-sized book (issues #459–466), including such features as the resolution of &quot;Return of the New Gods&quot; (cancelled in July–August 1978), &quot;Deadman&quot;, and the &quot;Justice Society of America&quot;.

The standard format returned (issues #467–478), split between a new Starman named Prince Gavyn and Plastic Man. With an increase in the story-and-art page count, the last four issues also included one more run of Aquaman. All three were dropped simultaneously to make way for a new version of an old feature, &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; (issues #479–490). Issue #490 (February 1982) saw the comic&#x27;s cancellation. &quot;Dial &#x27;H&#x27; for Hero&quot; was moved to &quot;New Adventures of Superboy&quot; as of that series&#x27; issue #28. &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; was soon rescued. As of the September issue it was revived as a digest-sized comic. This format lasted from issues #491–503, with most stories during this period being reprints (featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, from the beginning and in chronological order, and others), and with new stories featuring the Marvel Family and the Challengers of the Unknown including a new five-issue retelling of their origin. The long-running title was discontinued with the September 1983 issue.

===&quot;80-Page Giant&quot;===
An &quot;Adventure Comics 80-Page Giant&quot; was released in 1998.

===&quot;Justice Society Returns&quot;===
DC published an &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #1 as part of the company&#x27;s &quot;Justice Society Returns&quot; event in 1999.

===&quot;Adventure Comics Special Featuring the Guardian&quot;===
As part of the 2008 &quot;&quot; story arc, a special issue of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; was published, titled &quot;Adventure Comics Special Featuring the Guardian&quot; #1 (cover dated January 2009). Jimmy Olsen continues to delve into the mystery surrounding the American government&#x27;s safeguards against the new Kryptonian population.

==Revival==
The five-issue miniseries &quot;Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds&quot; led into an all-new volume of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, featuring the revived Conner Kent/Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes. The main creative team of Geoff Johns and Francis Manapul debuted in a backup story in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #0 (April 2009). A secondary feature starring the Legion of Super-Heroes was co-written with Mike Shoemaker and drawn by Clayton Henry. The first issue of the new run of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; was released on August 12, 2009, and features watermarked numbering marking it as both #1 &quot;and&quot; #504, thus continuing the original numeration of the series concurrently with the volume 2 numeration. For the variant incentive cover editions, the original numeration was dominant on the cover while the vol. 2 numeration was the watermarked numbering marking. The indicia of the comic book also reflects this dual numbering. The title officially returned to its original vol. 1 numbering with #516 (cover dated September 2010), until #529 when it was finally ended prior to DC&#x27;s The New 52 company reboot.

===Main feature===
====Superboy: The Boy of Steel (former)====
The revived ongoing title &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; features Conner as the headlining character for the first six issues in the story arc entitled, &quot;Superboy: The Boy of Steel&quot;. It begins as Conner settles back into his life in Smallville, Kansas. Returning to live with Martha Kent, who is thrilled to take the young boy in after her husband&#x27;s death, Conner returns to Smallville High School and begins keeping a journal of everything Superman has done as a costumed hero, going down a checklist titled, &quot;What Did Superman Do?&quot; He and the also recently returned Bart Allen supposedly rejoin the Teen Titans, and Conner symbolizes the team being &quot;stacked&quot; again by destroying his memorial statue outside of Titans Tower West.

====Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes====
After the Johns and Manapul run, writer Paul Levitz took over the series. It was renumbered with its previous numbering and highlighted Clark Kent&#x27;s years as Superboy as well as the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27; past. Starting with issue #523, the Legion Academy, by Levitz and Phil Jimenez, became the major feature.

===Second feature===
====Long Live the Legion (former)====
The Legion of Super-Heroes appeared as the second feature in issues #504–514 before taking over as the lead feature in issue #515 (August 2010).

====Atom====
Following this was the one-shot &quot;Brightest Day: Atom&quot;, written by Jeff Lemire with art by Mahmud Asrar. The same team was to create a ten-part, ten-page &quot;Atom&quot; co-feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, but DC ended all its second features and reduced its titles to twenty pages of story. Issue #521 was the last issue to feature the Atom.

<text>Holt International Children&#x27;s Services (HICS) is a faith-based humanitarian organization and adoption agency based in Eugene, Oregon, United States, known for international adoption and child welfare. The nonprofit works in thirteen countries, including: Cambodia, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Mongolia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam, and the United States. This work includes a range of services for children and families including efforts in nutrition, education, family strengthening, orphan care, foster care, family reunification, and child sponsorship. The organization&#x27;s stated mission is to seek a world where every child has a loving and secure home.

==History==
In 1954, Harry (1904–1964) and Bertha Holt (1904–2000) were busy raising their six children on a farm near the small Willamette Valley city of Creswell. In addition to farming, Harry ran a lumber company. Bertha, trained as a nurse, was a homemaker and mother.

After seeing a documentary film about &quot;G.I. babies&quot; of the Korean War in orphanages in Korea, the Holts decided they would adopt some of the children who needed families. Harry began preparations to go to Korea, and Bertha asked a friend how to go about adopting eight children from another country. Learning that it would be possible only if both houses of Congress passed a law allowing it, Bertha Holt decided to push for such a law.

Two months later, the &quot;Holt Bill&quot; was passed, and in October 1955, Harry Holt and eight children arrived at Portland International Airport. The resulting publicity stirred interest among many families in the United States. The Holts set about helping others to adopt, leading to the creation of the foundation. 

In recent years, the Holt agency was accused of illegal activities involving the Brothers Home between the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Moller, an adoptee from Denmark, discovered that his mother was alive and demanded an inquiry into illegal adoptions between the 1960s and 1980s by the Truth and Reflection commission. Additionally, Adam Crapser, who was adopted into an abusive home, found out that his citizenship was obtained illegally. The agency faced criticism in 2014 when a 3-year-old, Madoc Hyunsu O&#x27;Callaghan, was murdered by his adoptive father, Brian O&#x27;Callaghan. Before the adoption, Hyunsu&#x27;s foster mother had requested to adopt him, but Holt did not allow it. Furthermore, his adoptive father had concealed his PTSD during the screening process. 16-month-old Jeong-in was murdered by her adoptive parents in 2020, after being matched with them by Holt. This incident, along with the death of Sherin Mathews in Texas, led to the Indian government suspending ties with the agency. in September 2024, The Associated Press reported that Holt Agency and illegal adoption took away Korean children. 

==Awards==
In the year 2000, Bertha Holt was awarded the Kellogg&#x27;s Child Development Award from the World of Children Award for her work with the Holt International Children&#x27;s Services.

<text>Senegal competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eleventh appearance at the Olympics.

The Senegalese National Olympic and Sports Committee () sent a total of sixteen athletes to the Games, six men and ten women, to take part in six different sports. For the second consecutive time in the nation&#x27;s Olympic history, Senegal was represented by more female than male athletes. Five Senegalese athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including hurdler Mame Tacko Diouf and breaststroke swimmer Malick Fall, who carried the nation&#x27;s flag in the opening ceremony. There was only a single competitor in judo, table tennis, and wrestling.

Senegal, however, failed to win its first Olympic medal since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, where Amadou Dia Bâ won silver for the track hurdles.

==Athletics==

<text>Charles John Pedersen (, &quot;Yasui Yoshio&quot;, October 3, 1904 – October 26, 1989) was an American organic chemist best known for discovering crown ethers and describing methods of synthesizing them during his entire 42-year career as a chemist for DuPont at DuPont Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, and at DuPont&#x27;s Jackson Laboratory in Deepwater, New Jersey. Often associated with Reed McNeil Izatt, Pedersen also shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 with Donald J. Cram and Jean-Marie Lehn. He is the one of three Nobel Prize laureates born in Korea, along with Peace Prize laureate Kim Dae-jung and Literature laureate Han Kang.

Pedersen made many other discoveries in chemistry, such as discovering and developing metal deactivators. His early investigations also led to the development of a dramatically improved process for manufacturing tetraethyl lead, an important gasoline additive. He also contributed to the development of neoprene.

== Early life and education ==

Born on October 3, 1904, in Busan, Korea, Charles J. Pedersen was the youngest of three children. His father, Brede Pedersen, was a Norwegian marine engineer who immigrated to Korea in order to join the Korean customs service after leaving home due to family issues. Later, he worked as a mechanical engineer at the Unsan County mines in present-day North Korea. His Japanese mother, Takino Yasui, immigrated from Japan to Korea with her family and established a successful line of work by trading soybeans and silkworms located close to the Unsan County mines, where the couple ultimately met. Although not much is mentioned about his elder brother, who died of a childhood disease before Pedersen was born, he had an older sister named Astrid, who was five years older than him. In Japan, he used the Japanese given name Yoshio (良男), which he spelled using the kanji for &quot;good&quot; and &quot;man&quot;. According to Pedersen in a separate autobiographical account of his childhood, he had been born prior to the Russo-Japanese War and because his mother had still been grieving over the then-recent death of his older brother, he did not feel welcomed as a child.

Despite living in what is now South Korea, because Pedersen lived in the vicinity of the American-owned Unsan County mines, which spanned approximately 500 square miles in area, he grew up speaking primarily English.

At around 8 years old, Pedersen was sent by his family to study abroad in Nagasaki, Japan and then later transferred to St. Joseph College in Yokohama, Japan.

After successfully completing his education at St. Joseph College, due to the close ties his family had with the Society of Mary (Marianists), Pedersen decided to attend college in America at the University of Dayton in Ohio.

While spending his undergraduate life in 1922 studying chemical engineering at the University of Dayton in Ohio, Pedersen had been a well balanced student who immersed himself in the sports, academic and social aspects of his college. With a passion for the sport of tennis, Pedersen played on his school&#x27;s varsity tennis team under Coach Frank Kronauge, a former University of Dayton tennis captain. Playing for all four years of his undergraduate years, Pedersen became captain for both of his junior and senior seasons on the team. Furthermore, Pedersen spent his time as both the vice-president of the Engineers&#x27; Club as well as in charge of Literary in the Daytonian Editorial Department. Graduating from the University of Dayton in 1926 with a degree in chemical engineering, he was dedicated for his time at the university as well as the various accomplishments he made while studying as an undergraduate.

Earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering, Pedersen decided to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in order to obtain a master&#x27;s degree in organic chemistry. Although his professors at the time encouraged him to stay and pursue a PhD in organic chemistry, Pedersen decided to start his career instead, partially because he no longer wanted to be supported by his father. He is one of the few people to win a Nobel Prize in the sciences without having a PhD.

=== Du Pont ===
After leaving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Pedersen became employed at the DuPont Company in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1927 through connections from his research advisor, Professor James F. Norris. While at DuPont, Pedersen was able to begin research at the Jackson Laboratory under William S. Calcott and finished his career with DuPont at the Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware. As a young chemist at DuPont, Pedersen witnessed and gained inspiration many flourishing chemists such as Julian Hill and Roy J. Plunkett, and also breakthroughs in polymers and work in the field of organic chemistry. Pedersen had a particular interest in industry as he started his focus on his chemical career, which influenced the direction of problems he set out to solve as a chemist. As Pedersen began working on problems as a new chemist, he was free to work on whatever problems fascinated him and he quickly became interested in oxidative degradation and stabilization of substrate. Pedersen&#x27;s papers and work expanded beyond this, however it was a major influence to his eventual Nobel Prize awarded research.

Retiring at the age of 65, his work resulted in 25 papers and 65 patents, and in 1967, he published two works describing the methods of synthesizing crown ethers (cyclic polyethers). The donut-shaped molecules were the first in a series of extraordinary compounds that form stable structures with alkali metal ions. In 1987, he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in this area with Donald Cram and Jean-Marie Lehn, whom expanded upon his original discoveries. In the whole process of the Nobel Prize winning, the Dupont Company fully supported Pedersen by providing him a full-time public relations man, and a part-time secretary. DuPont Company also utilized their own corporate aircraft to accompany Pedersen and his family, as he could not travel on commercial aircraft.

== Discovery of the crown ethers ==
At around 1960, Pedersen went back to research in the field of Coordination Chemistry, focusing on the synthesis of multidentate ligands. It was recommended by his colleague Herman Schroeder to work on the coordination chemistry of vanadium before working on the polymerization and oxidative catalytic activity of vanadium. It was while working on this research that Pedersen made his discovery of crown ether. Through studying the bio[2-(o-Hydroxyphenoxy)Ethyl] ether, Pedersen accidentally discovered an unknown substances described as a &quot;goo&quot; while purifying the compound. Using ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy to study its reactions with phenol groups, after treating the samples with alkali, although the absorption curve initially showed no changes, it was observed to have shifted to higher absorption readings if one or more of the hydroxy groups were unpaired. Basing further research on this observation, Pedersen then dipped the unknown product in methanol and sodium hydroxide. Although the solution was not soluble in methanol, it became alkaline when in contact with the sodium hydroxide.

Due to not being soluble in methanol, Pedersen then proceeded to treat the methanol with soluble sodium salts, to which the unknown substance became soluble, allowing him to conclude that the solubility was due to sodium ions instead of alkalinity. Since the behavior of this substance mirrored that of 2,3-benzo-1,4,7-trioxacyclononane, with twice the molecular-weight, the unknown molecule was then coined as dibenzo-18-crown-6, the first of the aromatic crown compounds discovered.

== Associations with other chemists ==

=== Reed M. Izatt ===
In 1968 Izatt was on a train ride home when he stopped in Chicago to meet with the physiologist George Eisenman who informed Izatt about Pedersen&#x27;s paper on crown ethers published only months earlier. Izatt was looking forward to the possibilities of studying these crown ethers with his thermionic titration technique. Izatt called Pedersen and was the first scientist not at DuPont to meet with Pedersen about his discovery and Pedersen supplied him with a sample of his new crown ether compound. Izatt&#x27;s work on molecular recognition was greatly influenced by his interaction with Pedersen. In Izatt&#x27;s last visit with Pedersen prior to his death in 1988 he found a personal letter written by Pedersen that stated, &quot;Most men achieve &#x27;Immortality&#x27; through their progeny. I have no child of my own. Possibly, the crown ethers will serve, in a small way, to mark my footprint on earth&quot; and Izatt believing this too shares Pedersen&#x27;s message.

=== Donald J. Cram ===
Cram shared the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Pedersen but expanding on Pedersen&#x27;s monumental discovery in macrocyclic chemistry of crown ethers. Pedersen&#x27;s work was in two-dimensional structures but Cram was able to synthesize similar molecules in three-dimensional space. Cram&#x27;s synthesis of these three-dimensional molecules provided large gains in the production of enzymes made in labs as these structures have selectivity based on complementary structures.

=== Jean-Marie Lehn ===
Lehn was the other scientist who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Pedersen and was fundamental in starting the field of Supramolecular chemistry. Lehn&#x27;s work specifically identified in his recognition for the Nobel Prize was in his work on cryptands.

== Miscellaneous research ==
Although minimal research has been conducted on this compound, Pedersen observed that it had potential to work as a deactivator for copper. Nevertheless, it was the first of the many metal deactivators, which function by converting an inactive complex from an otherwise catalytic metal ion.

== Personal life ==
Pedersen was married to Susan J. Ault in 1947 and the couple then moved to Salem, New Jersey, where they resided until Ault died on February 8, 1983, at 72 years old. Pedersen was diagnosed with myeloma in 1983, and though he was becoming increasingly frail, he traveled to Stockholm to accept the Nobel Prize in late 1987. Shortly thereafter, he was awarded a medal for excellence by the DuPont Research Fellows. He died on 26 October 1989 in Salem, New Jersey.

== Legacy ==
Following Pedersen&#x27;s breakthrough in realizing his accidental product and structure of dibenzo-18-crown-6, huge advancements have been made in the fields of macrocyclic and supramolecular chemistry. Pedersen devoted the rest of his research career to studying these molecules and started one of the largest growths recently seen in a specific field of chemistry. This growth in Pedersen&#x27;s field of work following his momentous discovery for macrocyclic compounds can be seen in the work of the 2016 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry for molecular motors where Pedersen&#x27;s work allowed for the insight in how to create the molecular specific structures. The molecular machines were recognized as the focus of the 2016 Nobel Prize Winners, which were produced by connecting molecules to various molecular rings.

<doc id="945049" wikidata="Q5610027" url="?curid=945049" title="Henry Clinton (British Army officer, born 1771)">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton (9 March 1771 – 11 December 1829) was a British Army officer who served in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. He came from a family of soldiers. His elder brother was William Henry Clinton and his father was General Sir Henry Clinton the British Commander-in-Chief in North America during the American Revolutionary War, and his grandfather was Admiral of the Fleet George Clinton (1686–1761).

==Early military career==
Clinton first went to sea as a midshipman in 1786 in with Captain Erasmus Gower who was flag captain to Commodore John Elliot. Elliot was commander-in-chief and governor of Newfoundland from 1786 to 1788. Clinton suffered from severe seasickness and left the navy at the completion of three years with Captain Gower in Newfoundland.

He received his officer&#x27;s commission in 1787. He went on to serve in the Flanders campaign as an aide-de-camp to the Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, starting in 1793. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1795. Captured by the French, he was a prisoner in 1796–1797. During the 1799 campaign in northern Italy, he was a liaison officer with Alexander Suvarov&#x27;s Russian army. He went to India as adjutant general from 1802 to 1805.

At the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Clinton was the British military attaché to the Russian army. He commanded the garrison of Syracuse in Sicily in 1806–1807.

==Parliamentary career==
He became a member of parliament for Boroughbridge in 1808, holding the seat for the next 10 years.

==Peninsula==
During the campaign and Battle of Corunna in 1808–1809, he served as Sir John Moore&#x27;s adjutant general and was promoted to major-general in 1810.

During the remainder of the Peninsular War he commanded an infantry division under the Marquess of Wellington (later the Duke of Wellington). He was first appointed to command the 6th Division on 9February 1812. During the Battle of Salamanca, his division played a key part by defeating French General Bertrand Clausel&#x27;s counterattack. He then led his division in the Siege of Burgos campaign. From 26January to 25June 1813, Clinton was absent and Edward Pakenham took over the 6th Division. For his conduct at the Vitoria campaign, Clinton was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

He was absent again from 22July to October, when he again assumed command of the 6th Division. He was given the local rank of lieutenant general in 1813. He took part in the subsequent victories at the battles of the Nivelle, the Nive, Orthez and Toulouse. At the end of the Peninsular War he was made a lieutenant general and inspector-general of infantry, and was awarded the Army Gold Cross with one clasp.

==Waterloo==
In 1815 during the Battle of Waterloo, Clinton led the 2nd Division which Wellington posted in reserve behind his right flank. The 2nd Division included the 3rd British Brigade (Maj-Gen Frederick Adam), the 1st King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) Brigade (Col Du Plat), the 3rd Hanoverian Brigade (Col Hugh Halkett) and Lieut-Col Gold&#x27;s two artillery batteries (Bolton RA and Sympher KGL). His troops helped to defeat and pursue Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard at the end of the battle.

==Later life==
In 1815 he was made Colonel of the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), a position he held until his death.

He died at his country residence in Ashley, Hampshire on 11 December 1829. He had married Susan, the daughter of Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho. They had no children.

<doc id="945051" wikidata="Q722196" url="?curid=945051" title="Robert Conrad">
<text>Robert Conrad (born Conrad Robert Falk; March 1, 1935 – February 8, 2020) was an American film and television actor, singer, and stuntman. He is best known for his role in the 1965–1969 television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, playing the sophisticated Secret Service agent James T. West. He also portrayed private investigator Tom Lopaka in &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; (1959–1963) and World War II ace Pappy Boyington in &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; (1976–1978) [later syndicated as &quot;Black Sheep Squadron]&quot;.

In addition to acting, he was a singer and recorded several pop/rock songs in the late 1950s and early 1960s as Bob Conrad. He hosted a weekly two-hour national radio show (&quot;The PM Show with Robert Conrad&quot;) on CRN Digital Talk Radio beginning in 2008.

== Early life ==
Conrad was born Conrad Robert Falk in Chicago. His father, Leonard Henry Falk, was 17 years old at the time of Conrad&#x27;s birth and was of German descent. His mother, Alice Jacqueline Hartman (daughter of Conrad and Hazel Hartman), was 15 years old when she gave birth, and named her son after her father. She became the first publicity director of Mercury Records, where she was known as Jackie Smith. She married twice, including once to Chicago radio personality Eddie Hubbard in 1948. Eddie Hubbard and Jackie Smith reportedly had a child together (born ) before splitting up in 1958.

Conrad attended Chicago schools including South Shore High School, Hyde Park High School, the YMCA Central School, and New Trier High School. He dropped out of school at age 15 to work full-time, including loading trucks for Consolidated Freightways and Eastern Freightways, and driving a milk truck for Chicago&#x27;s Bowman Dairy.

After working in Chicago for several years and studying theater arts at Northwestern University, Conrad pursued an acting career. One of his first paying roles was a week-long job posing outside a Chicago theater where the film &quot;Giant&quot; (1956) was screened; Conrad bore a resemblance to the film&#x27;s lead, actor James Dean, so his mother used her entertainment industry contacts to help him get the part intended as a publicity stunt to boost attendance at the theater. Conrad also studied singing; his vocal coach was Dick Marx, the father of singer Richard Marx.

==Career==
===Early performances===
In 1957, Conrad met actor Nick Adams while visiting James Dean&#x27;s gravesite in Fairmount, Indiana. They became friends and Adams suggested that Conrad move to California to pursue acting.

Adams got a bit part for Conrad in the film &quot;Juvenile Jungle&quot; (1958). Adams was supposed to appear in it, but withdrew so he could take a part in a different movie. Conrad&#x27;s brief non-speaking role in &quot;Juvenile Jungle&quot; enabled him to join the Screen Actors Guild. He had a small role in the film &quot;Thundering Jets&quot;, also in 1958.

=== Warner Bros. ===

Conrad was soon signed to an acting contract by Warner Bros. He also sang, and released several recordings with Warner Bros. Records on a variety of LPs, EPs, and SPs 33-1/3 and 45 rpm records during the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1961, he had a minor &quot;Billboard&quot; hit song in &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; which reached No. 113.

At Warner, he appeared in the second season of the James Garner series &quot;Maverick&quot; (episode: &quot;Yellow River&quot;, 1959). He was featured in other shows, either for Warner or Ziv Television, including &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Colt .45&quot; (playing Billy the Kid), &quot;Sea Hunt&quot;, &quot;The Man and the Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Lock Up&quot;.

===&quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;===
Warner Brothers had a big success with its detective show &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, then made &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, a follow-up series. Conrad starred as detective Tom Lopaka. He was introduced on &quot;Strip&quot;, then spun off into a series that ran from 1959 to 1963, both in the U.S. and overseas. During the series&#x27; run, Conrad appeared on an episode of the Warner Brothers series &quot;The Gallant Men&quot;. After &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; was over, Conrad starred in &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; (1963).

In Mexico, Conrad signed a recording contract with the Orfeon label. He released two albums with a few singles sung in Spanish. In 1964, he guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Temple Houston&quot;, then performed in the comedic film &quot;La Nueva Cenicienta&quot; (also known as &quot;The New Cinderella&quot;). The next year, he was in the episode &quot;Four into Zero&quot; of &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, and portrayed Pretty Boy Floyd in &quot;Young Dillinger&quot; alongside his old friend Nick Adams.

===&quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;===
 
In 1965, Conrad began his starring role as government agent James West on the weekly series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, which aired on CBS until its cancellation in 1969. He made $5,000 a week. He did most of his own stunts and fight scenes during the series, and while filming the season four episode &quot;The Night of the Fugitives&quot;, he was injured and rushed to the hospital after he dove from the top of a saloon staircase, lost his grip on a chandelier, fell 12 feet, and landed on his head.

In addition to starring in &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, Conrad found time to work on other projects. He went to Mexico in 1967 to appear in &quot;Ven a cantar conmigo&quot; (&quot;Come, sing with me&quot;), a musical. He also formed his own company, Robert Conrad Productions, and under its auspices he wrote, starred in, and directed the Western film &quot;The Bandits&quot; (also 1967).

===Paul Ryan and Jake Webster===
Conrad appeared in episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In 1969, he signed a three-picture deal with Bob Hope&#x27;s Doan Productions. The first two films were slated to be &quot;Keene&quot; then &quot;No Beer in Heaven&quot;, but only the first movie was ever produced.

In 1969, he debuted as prosecutor Paul Ryan in the TV movie &quot;D.A.: Murder One&quot; (1969). He reprised the movie in &quot;D.A.: Conspiracy to Kill&quot; (1971) and the short-lived 1971 series &quot;The D.A.&quot;. In 1971, He also played Deputy D.A. Paul Ryan on &quot;Adam-12&quot;, (Episode: The Radical) and in a compilation of several of the 1/2 hour &quot;The D.A&quot; episodes into a TV movie syndicated as &quot;Confessions of a D.A. Man.&quot; He was also in such made-for-television movies as &quot;Weekend of Terror&quot; (1970) and &quot;Five Desperate Women&quot; (1971). He tried another TV series as American spy Jake Webster in &quot;Assignment Vienna&quot; (1972), which lasted only eight episodes. He was a murderous fitness franchise promoter in a fourth season episode of &quot;Columbo&quot; (&quot;An Exercise in Fatality&quot;, 1974). Conrad starred in the feature films &quot;Murph the Surf&quot; (1975) and &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (1977).

===&quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;===
Conrad briefly returned to series TV from 1976 to 1978 as legendary tough-guy World War II fighter ace Pappy Boyington in &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot;, retitled for its second season and in later syndication as &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot; in a re-tooling that failed to keep the series on the air. He directed three episodes.

Despite the show&#x27;s struggles in the ratings, Conrad went on to win a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Actor and a Golden Globe nomination for his performance. He followed it with a lead part in the television miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot; (1978).

===&quot;The Duke&quot; and &quot;A Man Called Sloane&quot;===
In 1978, Conrad starred in the short-lived TV series &quot;The Duke&quot; as Duke Ramsey, a boxer turned private eye. Conrad directed some episodes. In the late 1970s, he served as the captain of the NBC team for six editions of &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot;. Around this time he reprised the role of West in a pair of made-for-TV films which reunited him with his &quot;West&quot; co-star, Ross Martin, &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot; (1979) and &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; (1980).

Conrad was identified in the late 1970s with his television commercials for Eveready batteries, particularly his placing of the battery on his shoulder and prompting the viewer to challenge its long-lasting power: &quot;Come on, I dare ya&quot;. The commercial was parodied frequently on American television comedies such as Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

Conrad made the occasional feature such as &quot;The Lady in Red&quot; (1979) for Roger Corman&#x27;s New World Pictures, where he played John Dillinger from a script by John Sayles. Conrad later played a modern-day variation of James West in the short-lived series &quot;A Man Called Sloane&quot; in 1979. Conrad directed some episodes.

=== 1980s: Producer ===

Conrad spent most of the 1980s starring in television movies. He played a paraplegic coach in &quot;Coach of the Year&quot; (1980), and the title role in &quot;&quot; (1982). Both were for his own company, A Shane Productions.

In 1984 Conrad and his production company produced the film, &quot;Hard Knox&quot;, an unsold pilot for a proposed TV series. He played the lead role of retired U.S. Marine Colonel Joseph Knox, who returns to his childhood home of Mount Carroll, Illinois, to teach at his alma mater, a local military prep academy. The film was shot in Mount Carroll at the former Shimer College.

Conrad played a Police Chief in the theatrically released comedy film &quot;Moving Violations&quot; (1985), and appeared in the TV movies &quot;The Fifth Missile&quot; (1986), &quot;Assassin&quot; (1986) and &quot;Charley Hannah&#x27;s War&quot; (1986).

In 1986, Conrad served as special guest referee for the main event of WrestleMania 2 between Hulk Hogan and King Kong Bundy in a Steel Cage Match for the WWF Championship.

In 1987, he starred as Jesse Hawkes in the short-lived TV series &quot;High Mountain Rangers&quot; with his sons Shane Conrad and Christian Conrad, about a family of wilderness rescue and law enforcement officers in Lake Tahoe. The series was canceled after 13 episodes, but was reworked for the 1989 series &quot;Jesse Hawkes,&quot; which saw Hawkes and his sons becoming bounty hunters in San Francisco. The series was canceled after 6 episodes.

=== 1990s ===

Conrad appeared in the music video for Richard Marx&#x27;s &quot;Hazard&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit in 13 countries including the United States. He had a supporting role in &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; (1996) with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Conrad&#x27;s later credits include an episode of &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; and the film &quot;Dead Above Ground&quot; (2002).

Conrad appeared in the movie &quot;Samurai Cowboy&quot; in 1994. The following year, he essentially rebooted &quot;High Mountain Rangers&quot;, reteaming with his sons Shane and Christian, and his second wife LaVelda Fann, in the TV movie pilot &quot;High Sierra Search and Rescue&quot;, which led to a short-lived TV series that was canceled after only eight episodes. 

=== 2000s–2010s ===

In 2005, he ran for President of the Screen Actors Guild. In 2006, Conrad recorded audio introductions for every episode of the first season of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; for its North American DVD release on June 6. The DVD set also included one of Conrad&#x27;s Eveready battery commercials; in his introduction, Conrad stated he was flattered to be parodied by Carson. He was inducted into the Hollywood Stuntmen&#x27;s Hall of Fame for his work on &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; series.

Beginning in 2008, he hosted a weekly two-hour national radio show (&quot;The PM Show with Robert Conrad&quot;) on CRN Digital Talk Radio. He appeared in the documentary film &quot;Pappy Boyington Field&quot; (released in July 2010 on DVD) where he recounted his personal insights about the legendary Marine Corps aviator he portrayed in the television series. His last appearance on the radio show was July 18, 2019, and Mike Garey was his co-host.

==Personal life and death==
Conrad and his first wife Joan were married for 25 years and had five children. They divorced amicably in 1977. That same year he met his second wife LaVelda Ione Fann. He was 43 when he emceed the Miss National Teenager Pageant, which she won. Their marriage produced three children before their divorce in 2010. His two families were said to &quot;get along famously&quot;. Conrad was joined on some television shows by his sons, Shane and Christian, and his daughter, Nancy. Another daughter, Joan, became a television producer.

In a 2008 interview, Conrad described Chicago Outfit associate and burglar Michael Spilotro as his &quot;best friend&quot;. Spilotro&#x27;s murder was featured in the movie &quot;Casino&quot;. In 1984, Conrad was awarded a star on the Walk of Western Stars in Newhall, California (now a part of Santa Clarita).

Conrad was involved with a volunteer organization in Bear Valley, California, known as Bear Valley Search and Rescue, which later formed the basis for &quot;High Mountain Rangers&quot;.

On March 31, 2003, while on Highway 4 in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada foothills near his Alpine County home, Conrad drove his Jaguar over the center median and slammed head-on into a Subaru driven by 26-year-old Kevin Burnett. Both men suffered serious injuries. As a result, Conrad faced felony charges to which he pleaded no contest. His plea was accepted, and he was convicted of drunk driving.

He was sentenced to six months of house confinement, alcohol counseling, and five years&#x27; probation. A civil suit filed by Kevin Burnett against Conrad was settled the following year for an undisclosed amount. In 2005, Burnett died at age 28 from perforated ulcers; his family attributed them to his difficult recovery from the crash. Conrad suffered severe nerve injuries from the crash, leaving his right side partially paralyzed.

Conrad died of heart failure in Malibu, California, on February 8, 2020, at age 84.

<doc id="945052" wikidata="Q733330" url="?curid=945052" title="Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics held in London, England, 26 athletics events were contested, all for men only. A total of 79 medals (27 gold, 27 silver, 25 bronze) were awarded.

Each nation was allowed to enter up to 12 competitors in most of the events. In the team races (the medley relay and the 3 mile team race), each nation entered one team. The medley relay was run by four athletes, with four alternates allowed. In the 3 mile team race, five athletes from each nation ran with only three counting.

The competition was restricted to amateurs, and was held under the rules of the British Amateur Athletic Association.

==Medal summary==
==Medal table==
==Events==
The 1908 Games were the first to feature race walking, with two different events held. Two different forms of javelin throwing also appeared, introducing the new throwing apparatus to the programme. The 60 metre short sprint was dropped from the programme, as was the middle hurdle distance. Steeplechasing was done at 3200 metres instead of the 2500 metres that had been included at the previous two editions; the team race also had its distance shortened. A short track relay event was added. The multi-discipline triathlon and decathlon events that had been held at the 1904 Games were both absent. An event featuring the discus, which had become a staple of Olympic athletics, was held in which throwers had to follow a very specific throwing style. Overall there was one more event on the 1908 programme than there had been in 1904.

<text>Lloyds Bank Canada was a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary of Lloyds Bank Plc of the United Kingdom from 1986 to 1990. Its headquarters were in Toronto, and it had 53 branches throughout Canada. It functioned as a member of the Lloyds Bank Group, whose overseas domestic banking interests also included the National Bank of New Zealand.

Lloyds Bank International opened two new offices in Canada in 2009, offering its international mortgage.

==History==
Lloyds Bank Canada was chartered in 1986, when Lloyds Bank acquired 90 per cent of the assets and most of the liabilities of the Continental Bank of Canada. Continental Bank had been formed earlier in the 1980s, when Niagara Finance Company, later IAC Limited, decided to expand the scope of operations.

In 1989, after several years of losses, agreement was reached for the sale of Lloyds Bank&#x27;s interest in the whole of the issued share capital of the Canadian operation to the Hongkong Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of London-based HSBC Holdings, for a consideration of CAD 190 million. In 1999, HBC changed its name to HSBC Bank Canada, consistent with its parent&#x27;s strategy of creating a global brand.

<text>Scott Scovell Hamilton (born August 28, 1958) is a retired American figure skater and Olympic gold medalist. He won a gold medal in the 1984 Winter Olympics, four consecutive World Championships (1981–84) and four consecutive U.S. championships (1981–84). His signature move, the backflip, a feat few other figure skaters could perform at the time, is against U.S. Figure Skating and Olympic competition rules. Yet, he would include it in his exhibition routines as an amateur to please the crowd. Later, he also used the backflip in his professional competition routines. He is widely recognized for his innovative footwork sequences. In retirement, he has been involved in charitable work and is the author of three books.

==Early life and education ==
Hamilton was born on August 28, 1958, in Bowling Green, Ohio. He was adopted at the age of six weeks by Dorothy (née McIntosh), a professor, and Ernest S. Hamilton, a professor of biology, and raised in Bowling Green, Ohio. He has two siblings, older sister Susan (his parents&#x27; biological daughter) and younger brother Steven (who was also adopted). He attended Kenwood Elementary School. When Hamilton was two years old, he contracted a mysterious illness that caused him to stop growing. After numerous tests and several wrong diagnoses (including a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis that gave him just six months to live), the disease began to correct itself. His family physician sent him to Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital to see Dr. Shwachman. He was told the doctor had no idea what was wrong and to go home and stop the diets in order to live a normal life. Years later, it was determined that a congenital brain tumor was the root cause of his childhood illness. At the peak of his amateur career Hamilton weighed and was tall, but eventually grew to a height of .

At age 13, Hamilton began training with Pierre Brunet, a former Olympic champion. In 1976, however, he was almost forced to quit skating because the cost of training was too high and he enrolled in college. However, Helen and Frank McLoraine stepped in to provide financial support for Hamilton to continue his training. Hamilton would later work with the McLoraines in continuing philanthropic support for figure skating. Hamilton attended Bowling Green State University in Ohio. The former First Street in Bowling Green was named Scott Hamilton Avenue in his honor.

==Skating career==
In 1980, Hamilton finished third in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, earning him a place on the U.S. Olympic team. At this time, Don Laws was coaching him. He finished in fifth place at the 1980 Winter Olympics, where he also had the honor of carrying the American flag in the opening ceremony. His breakthrough performance was in the 1981 U.S. Championships. He performed flawlessly and the audience began a standing ovation several seconds before the end of the performance. He never lost an amateur competition again. In 1981 he won gold in the World Figure Skating Championships. During the long program, he received scores of 5.8s and 5.9s for technical merit and 5.7s at 5.9s for artistic impression out of a perfect score of 6.0. He started the long program off with a triple Lutz jump, his most consistent and hardest jump. He performed a strong program in spite of a minor flub. He won gold again in 1982 and 1983 at the U.S. and World Championships.

At the 1984 Olympics, he won the compulsory figures and placed second in the short program. For the long program, he planned five jumps: a triple Lutz, a triple flip, a triple toe loop in combination with a double loop, a triple toe walley and a triple Salchow. He completed only three of them, missing the triple flip and the triple Salchow. For technical merit, the nine judges gave him three 5.6&#x27;s, two 5.7&#x27;s, three 5.8&#x27;s and a 5.9. For artistic impression, he received four 5.8&#x27;s and five 5.9&#x27;s. Brian Orser won the long program and Hamilton was second, but Hamilton won the gold medal because Orser was too far back in the overall standings to catch Hamilton after placing 7th in the compulsory figures, which at the time accounted for 30% of the total score. Hamilton&#x27;s victory ended a 24-year gold medal drought for US men in Olympic figure skating. He did not attempt the triple Axel jump, a more difficult jump which other skaters in the competition landed. He won that year&#x27;s World Championships and then turned professional in April 1984.
Figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, in her critique of male figure skating, called the costumes Hamilton wore during the 1984 Olympics an attempt to mitigate the &quot;erotic affect&quot; of the one-piece, Disco-influenced outfits popular with many male skaters at the time. She described Hamilton&#x27;s costumes as &quot;simple stretch suits in one color ornamated only by a simple geometic shape in a contasting color&quot;, which resembled a warm-up or speed skating suit that emphasized the &quot;acceptable male sport aspect&quot; of figure skating.

After turning professional, Hamilton toured with the Ice Capades for two years, and then created &quot;Scott Hamilton&#x27;s American Tour,&quot; which later was renamed Stars on Ice. He co-founded, co-produced and performed in Stars on Ice for 15 years before retiring from the tour in 2001 (though he still returns for occasional guest performances).

As a professional, Hamilton often performed his signature backflip, a movement that is sanctioned by the International Skating Union (ISU), the organization that governs figure skating. Kestnbaum states that it was &quot;an acknowledgement of the illegality of the move&quot; to the ISU .

He has been awarded numerous skating honors, including being the first solo male figure skater to be awarded the Jacques Favart Award (in 1988). In 1990 he was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame.

==Career in media==
===Broadcasting career===
Hamilton was a skating commentator for CBS television for many years, beginning in 1985. He has also worked for NBC television. In 2006 he was the host of the FOX television program &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot;. He currently serves on the board of directors for Special Olympics International.

===Television appearances===
Hamilton voiced the dog dancing commentator on the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;Dances with Dogs&quot;. He was also seen in the 2008 &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot; episode &quot;The Fairy Oddlympics&quot; as Timmy Turner&#x27;s co-host.

He appeared on the August 26, 2008 episode of &quot;Wanna Bet?&quot;, where he finished 2nd, losing to Bill Engvall. In 2009, he appeared in the second season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;.

He made a small appearance on &quot;Roseanne&quot; as himself, participating in a mock linoleum skating competition credit sequence. He also made a brief appearance in the film &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;.

On March 8, 2010, &quot;Scott Hamilton: Return to the Ice&quot; premiered on the Bio Channel. The two-hour television special chronicled Hamilton&#x27;s return to skating after battling cancer.

===Book authorship===
In 1999, Hamilton wrote the book &quot;Landing It&quot;, in which he talks about his life on &amp; off the ice. In 2009, Hamilton wrote the book &quot;The Great Eight&quot;, which shared the secrets to his happiness and how he overcame numerous challenges and disappointments throughout his life. In 2018, he wrote the book &quot;Finish First: Winning Changes Everything&quot; (publisher: Thomas Nelson), about the value of competition.

==Personal life==
===Family===
On November 14, 2002, he married Tracie Robinson, a nutritionist. The couple welcomed their first son in 2004 and a second son in 2008. Later in 2013, the couple adopted two orphaned brothers from Haiti. The family resides in Franklin, Tennessee.

===Faith===
Hamilton is a Christian and has said about his faith, &quot;I understand that through a strong relationship with Jesus you can endure anything... God is there to guide you through the tough spots. God was there every single time, every single time.&quot;

===Illnesses===
In 1997, Hamilton had a much-publicized battle with testicular cancer. Hamilton was initially concerned that he may have been rendered infertile following his cancer treatment, but later went on to father two children. He made a return to skating after his treatment and his story was featured in magazines and on television. It was announced on November 12, 2004, that Hamilton had a benign brain tumor, which was treated at the Cleveland Clinic.

On June 23, 2010, Hamilton had brain surgery to prevent the recurrence of the benign tumor discovered in 2004. Called craniopharyngioma, the tumor could have caused blindness if left untreated. The surgery was successful. In November 2010, Hamilton was in the hospital again. During the removal of the tumor, an artery in the brain was &quot;nicked&quot;. The bleeding stopped, but an aneurysm formed days later. Hamilton came through the surgery well.

In 2016, Hamilton announced that he had received his third brain tumor diagnosis. In late March 2017, he stated that the tumor had shrunk without chemo.

===Charitable work===
In 1990, as the Make-A-Wish Foundation honored its 10th birthday, Hamilton was recognized as the Foundation&#x27;s first ever &quot;Celebrity Wish Granter of the Year.&quot;

He founded the Scott Hamilton Cares Foundation to assist with cancer patient support. He has been a longtime volunteer with the Special Olympics and currently serves as a Special Olympics Global Ambassador. Hamilton has also helped benefit St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital and the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, of which he is an honorary board member.

<text>Pierre Brassard (born April 24, 1966) is a French-Canadian actor, comedian, television personality, and radio broadcaster. He is associated with CKOI-FM in Montreal and known for his phone call hoaxes.

In one publicized incident, Brassard, thinly disguised as a television reporter, encountered former Canadian prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau at the 1993 Montreal Film Festival. After Brassard asked a series of absurd questions, Trudeau ripped off Brassard&#x27;s fake beard, slapped the prankster in the face, and aimed a kick at his groin.

In 2021 he was a competitor on &quot;Chanteurs masqués&quot;, the Quebec adaptation of the &quot;Masked Singer&quot; franchise. He sang Les B.B.&#x27;s &quot;Fais attention&quot; in costume as a speckled trout, but was the second person eliminated from the competition.

<doc id="945077" wikidata="Q119160" url="?curid=945077" title="Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture">
<text>The Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture (MoDA) was a museum in North London, England, housing one of the most comprehensive collections of 19th- and 20th-century decorative arts for the home. 

The collections included the Silver Studio collection of designs for wallpapers and textiles, the Charles Hasler collection, and the Crown Wallpaper Archive.

In 2008 the Silver Studio Collection was Designated as being of outstanding national and international quality and significance by Arts Council England.

The museum was part of Middlesex University. 
Between 2000 and 2011 the museum was located at Cat Hill, Barnet, on Middlesex University&#x27;s art and design campus. Exhibitions included: Purl (2004) The Suburban Landscape: 200 Years of Gardens and Gardening (2008); Japantastic: Japanese-inspired patterns for British homes, 1880-1930 (2010), and Petal Power (2011).

From 2011 to 2023 the MoDA Collections Centre was based at Beaufort Park in Colindale, close to Middlesex University&#x27;s Hendon campus in the London Borough of Barnet. During this time the museum ran several innovative research projects including The Hasler Gallery (2015); Katagami in Practice (2016-18), funded by Arts Council England; and Exploration of Social Sharing (2022), with support from the Art Fund. The museum also published a podcast &#x27;That Feels Like Home&#x27; before and during the pandemic. 

The museum closed to visitors in September 2023 with a plan to end all remaining operations by July 2024.

== The Silver Studio Collection ==
The Silver Studio (run by the Silver family) was a commercial design practice, based in West London, which between 1880 and 1963 completed more than 20,000 schemes for items such as furnishing fabrics, wallpapers, tablecloths, rugs and carpets. The Studio employed a number of designers, some of whom, such as Archibald Knox, were well known in their own right. There were many others whose work remained anonymous.

The Silver Studio&#x27;s customers were retailers and manufacturers of wallpapers and textiles at all levels of the market, both in Britain and abroad. Designs for wallpapers were sold both to manufacturers producing cheap papers for the mass market, such as Lightbown Aspinall and Potters of Darwen, as well as those selling high quality products for the top end of the market, such as Essex &amp; Co, John Line, and Sandersons. Silver Studio designs were bought by all the leading British textile manufacturers, including Stead McAlpin, Alexander Morton, and AH Lee, to name just a few. Clients included well known producers of high quality fabrics, such as Turnbull &amp; Stockdale and the famous department store, Liberty.

Because the majority of the Silver Studio&#x27;s clients were mass producers, Silver Studio designs found their way into numerous British homes. The Studio&#x27;s influence on British interiors over a remarkable length of time can be seen in the huge number of their designs that went into production.

After it closed in the early 1960s, the contents of the Silver Studio were given to the Hornsey College of Art, which subsequently became part of what is now Middlesex University.

Silver Studio designs found their way into many British homes over a long period, because most of its clients were mass producers. The significance of the Silver Studio as a design practice was acknowledged in 1981 with the awarding of an English Heritage blue plaque to 84 Brook Green, Hammersmith, the building that was both the Studio and the Silver family home.

While it was part of the Museum of Domestic Design and Architecture, Middlesex University, the Silver Studio Collection was both a resource for historians interested in the history of domestic interiors, and a visual resource for students and creative practitioners.

== Charles Hasler Collection ==

This material was the working collection of designer and typographer, Charles Hasler (1908-1992). Hasler played a significant role in many high-profile exhibitions, displays, poster campaigns and book publishing in Britain from the mid-1930s to the mid-1980s.

Between 1942 and 1951, Hasler was an exhibition designer for the Ministry of Information and the Central Office of Information. He worked on displays such as ‘Dig For Victory’, ‘Make Do and Mend’ and ‘Nation and the Child’. After the war, he became a senior designer and chairman of the Typographic Panel for the Festival of Britain of 1951.

Hasler designed and produced the influential Specimen of Display Letters for use by Festival architects and designers. Throughout his career, Hasler lectured in typographic design and history and was involved with the education and professional development of print and graphic designers

Hasler was interested in the newly emerging field of packaging and branding and in the role of typographical design. His collection reflects his keen interest in all kinds of printed material and includes postcards, playbills, sheet music, packaging and posters dating from the nineteenth century onwards.

In May 2024 ownership of the Charles Hasler Collection was transferred to the University of Reading Special Collections. The Charles Hasler Collection will make a great contribution to Reading’s existing holdings, that include the Archive of British Publishing and Printing.

== Sir James Richards Library ==
MoDA previously held the Sir James Maude Richards Library on long-term loan. This was a collection of architectural books and journals collected by Sir JM Richards (1907-1992), a leading spokesman and theorist of the Modern Movement in architecture in Britain.

The collection was returned to its owner in February 2024.

== Crown Wallpaper Archive ==
MoDA&#x27;s Crown Wallpaper Collection consisted of around 5,000 wallpaper albums and samples dating from the early 1950s to the late 1960s, donated to the museum by Crown Wallpapers in 1989.

Along with the wallpapers of MoDA&#x27;s Silver Studio Collection, this collection represents one of the country&#x27;s finest bodies of non-elite wallpapers of the late nineteenth to the mid twentieth centuries. The majority of the wallpapers held here were intended for the mass market, not for ‘high-end’ consumers, and could therefore be seen as a barometer of British taste over a long period.

The majority of items from the Crown Wallpaper collection were divided between the Whitworth Art Gallery and Sanderson Design Group when the museum closed.

== The Domestic Design Collection 1870–1960 ==
This collection consisted of over 4,000 books, journals, magazines and trade and retail catalogues relating to all aspects of home furnishing, household management, cookery, house building, DIY, home crafts and gardening.

A particularly important element was the material relating to the growth of North London suburbia between around 1900 and 1939. It consisted of posters, brochures and other publicity material produced by property developers, builders and estate agents. This material complemented the other items relating to domestic decoration and furnishing from the same period.

== Dispersal of the Collections ==

The closure of the museum in 2024 meant that items from the Crown Wallpaper collection and Domestic Design Collection were split and distributed among various institutions: 

&lt;li&gt;The suburbia-related material mainly went to Enfield Local Studies Archive and Ealing Local Studies Archive.

&lt;li&gt;The University of Brighton Design Archives received material relating to the Festival of Britain, the Council of Industrial Design, and also designs and textiles by Enid Marx and designs by Laurence Scarfe.

&lt;li&gt; Manchester Metropolitan University Special Collections Museum and Buckinghamshire New University each accepted a proportion of the collection of trade and retail catalogues 

&lt;li&gt; the Knitting Reference Library at Winchester School of Art accepted a number of knitting patterns and related magazines.

&lt;li&gt; Gunnersbury Park and Museum received tiles and ephemera designed by ceramic tile designer and artist, Eleanor Greeves

&lt;li&gt; A collection of paint charts and ephemera relating to Ripolin went to Tate Archive 

&lt;li&gt; A collection of cookery books was transferred to the Food Museum

&lt;li&gt; Sanderson Design Group and The Whitworth Art Gallery each accepted a proportion of the collection of wallpapers and textiles 

&lt;li&gt; Lancaster City Museums and Kirkcaldy Galleries each received linoleum-related material

&lt;li&gt; Braintree District Museum received Bardfield wallpapers by Bawden and Aldridge

&lt;li&gt; Oral histories and images of home interiors donated by members of the public were transferred to the Mass Observation Archive at The Keep, along with the Location Finder collection of images of homes and domestic buildings compiled by a TV and film location scout between 1980-2000

<text>Ottobrunn () is a municipality southeast of Munich, Bavaria, Germany, founded in 1955. Ottobrunn consists of mainly semi-detached and detached houses, as well as extensive garden areas. Ottobrunn is also the German Headquarters of Airbus Defense and Space (former European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS)), with the majority of Airbus DS grounds situated in the neighbouring community of Taufkirchen. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, the municipality is the second-most densely populated in all of Germany, trailing only Munich, and ahead of Berlin.

==History==
The town&#x27;s center was established in the mid-1980s with the town hall (1983) and the community centre (1986). The community centre was named after the German-Italian composer Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari who lived in Ottobrunn between 1915 and 1931.

There is a memorial Doric order column, called the Ottosäule, made by the chiseler Anton Ripfel, commemorating the day in 1832 when Otto of Greece traveled past the present community area on his way to become king of Greece. It was originally situated exactly from the center of Munich, marking the exact spot on the route where Otto of Greece&#x27;s father left his son. The column was moved, however, southwest, to make room for widening the Rosenheimer Landstrasse.

<text>Grenada competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

Grenada Olympic Committee sent a total of five athletes (three men and two women), competing only in athletics and swimming. Track runner and world indoor champion Alleyne Francique was appointed by the committee to become the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. A top favorite in the men&#x27;s 400 metres, Francique narrowly missed a chance to grab the nation&#x27;s first ever Olympic medal with a fantastic fourth-place finish.

==Athletics ==

Grenadan athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).
