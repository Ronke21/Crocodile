<text>ABC Signature was an American television production studio and the flagship production arm of ABC, which is a subsidiary of Disney Television Studios, a sub-division of the Disney Entertainment business segment and division of The Walt Disney Company. The studio&#x27;s banner was also used by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for its distribution of the studio&#x27;s shows on home video starting 2008.

Established in 1950 as the television unit of the company under the name Walt Disney Productions, it was renamed Walt Disney Network Television in 1983 and was merged with a separate studio known as the first incarnation of Touchstone Television, which was established in 1985. Disney rebranded the studio as ABC Studios in 2007 in an in-house push to drop secondary brands. It was then renamed to its current name on August 10, 2020, after it merged with another separate studio, ABC Signature Studios. It was folded into 20th Television, which had been acquired by Disney in 2019.

== Background ==
=== Walt Disney Productions (television unit) ===
In the 1930s, Walt Disney had no interest in television, but that changed by 1950 when he did an hour-long special on NBC, followed up a year after by a special on CBS. Both of these programs received excellent ratings. Disney eventually got into full series production when &quot;Disneyland&quot; debuted on ABC in 1954.

Following the success of &quot;Disneyland&quot;, in 1957, Disney was producing another primetime series for ABC, the western show &quot;Zorro&quot;. It did not last long in the ratings and was cancelled in 1959.

In 1961, Disney severed its terms with ABC and moved its weekly program to NBC, where it stayed for nearly 20 years until 1981. For years, Disney&#x27;s lone television show on primetime was the eponymous anthology series.

After NBC axed the program, in 1981, it struck an agreement with CBS to take the anthology program there. In 1982, Disney produced the first prime-time show since the cancellation of &quot;Zorro&quot; in 1959, &quot;Herbie the Love Bug&quot;. It was cancelled after only one season. It was followed by three more programs as part of an agreement with CBS, &quot;Gun Shy&quot;, &quot;Small &amp; Frye&quot; and &quot;Zorro and Son&quot;. These were sitcoms, and were cancelled after one season.

== History ==
=== Walt Disney Television/Touchstone Television ===
After the cancellation of the three prime-time series on CBS in 1983, Disney ventured back into primetime television. The Touchstone Films banner was used for television by then-new Disney CEO Michael Eisner in the 1984–1985 television season, with the short lived western &quot;Wildside&quot;. By 1985, Disney signed an agreement with sitcom producers Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions. In the next season, Disney&#x27;s television production unit produced a hit in &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; using the Touchstone Films brand. The Touchstone name would be used for more mature shows, while the Disney name would be used for more family friendly series.

By the 1986-1987 television season, Disney was producing two shows for the fall season, &quot;Sidekicks&quot;, produced under the Walt Disney Television label; and &quot;The Ellen Burstyn Show&quot;, produced under the Touchstone Television label. Both were cancelled after the fall 1986 season, to be followed up by two more shows produced by Touchstone, the ABC show &quot;Harry&quot;, and the Fox show &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;. In 1987, Randy Reiss was named president of both television units. In the fall of 1987, Disney sold its third television drama, &quot;The Oldest Rookie&quot;, to CBS. In late 1988, after Witt/Thomas/Harris pulled out of the TeleVentures production unit (they were co-founders along with Tri-Star Pictures and Stephen J. Cannell Productions), Disney began selling, marketing and distributing Witt/Thomas programs exclusively. It was renewed two years later in 1990; the duo left to sign with rival Warner Bros. Television in 1992.

On April 18, 1989, Walt Disney Television and Touchstone Television were grouped together under Garth Ancier, the then-president of network television for Walt Disney Studios. The following week, Disney struck development deals with upstart Wind Dancer Productions (headed by &quot;Roseanne&quot; alumnus Matt Williams), and KTMB Productions (backed by &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; writers Kathy Speer, Terry Grossman, Barry Fanaro and Mort Nathan). The first projects were Wind Dancer&#x27;s &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; and KTMB&#x27;s &quot;The Fanelli Boys&quot;, both of which aired on NBC. That same year, Disney signed a long-term contract with producer Michael Jacobs and his production company. Among the first projects under the collaboration was &quot;Singer &amp; Sons&quot;, for NBC in 1990. The company also had a contract with producer Terry Louise Fisher, after she quit &quot;L.A. Law&quot; due to disputes with co-creator Steven Bochco and studio 20th Television, then-known as 20th Century Fox Television. Later that year, Disney signed a deal with Neal Marlens and Carol Black, creators of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, to produce three series for ABC.

With difficulties of selling in the off-network syndicated market, Disney television executives decided in late September 1990 that &quot;Hull High&quot;, then on NBC, or a potential NBC mid-season replacement in &quot;Disney Action-Adventure Hour&quot;, would be its last hour-long drama. &quot;High&quot;&#x27;s pilot cost the company $4.5 million. The company also had another drama in collaboration with Stephen J. Cannell, &quot;The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage&quot;, which was produced under the Walt Disney TV label. In 1991, Disney collaborated with Michael Jacobs and Jim Henson Productions on a primetime sitcom with puppets by Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, which debuted on ABC. In 1992, the Touchstone TV label moved into producing longer forms for TV, focusing on more adult-oriented fare with its first telefilm for CBS about Edna Buchanan, a Miami Herald crime reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize. The company would eventually sign a deal with ABC to develop 5 television movies for the 1993–94 and 1994-95 TV seasons.

In 1992, KTMB Productions left Disney for Paramount. Eventually the team split into two separate production companies, one led by Speer and Grossman, the other led by Fanaro and Nathan. Within that same year, Wind Dancer Productions had received an exclusive deal with the ABC television network, with Disney serving as distributor of their series. And also that year, Michael Jacobs had renewed his deal with the studio. In 1993, Disney had reached a deal with comedian Sinbad and his David &amp; Golitah Productions company for a film and TV deal.

On August 24, 1994, with Jeffrey Katzenberg&#x27;s resignation, Richard Frank became head of Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications, a new group taking in Touchstone Television and other TV units of the Disney studios. In 1995, they returned to producing dramas with &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;. That same year, Wind Dancer was signed to a new deal with Disney, following the expiration of their contract with ABC.

In April 1996, with the ongoing post-Disney-CC/ABC merger and the retirement of its president, Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications&#x27; divisions were reassigned to other groups, with Walt Disney Television and Touchstone Television transferred to The Walt Disney Studios. In 1997, Disney struck a deal with Imagine Entertainment to launch a television venture. On November 1, 1997, David Neuman assumed the presidency of Touchstone TV while retaining his post as president of Walt Disney Network Television. In March 1998, Touchstone TV was placed under Buena Vista Television Productions, a newly formed group under chairman Lloyd Braun, along with Walt Disney Network Television. In June 1998, former ABC chief Greer Shephard and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; director Michael M. Robin launched a production company with an exclusive agreement at the studio. In May 1999, J.J. Abrams, who created &quot;Felicity&quot; at that time, signed a film and television deal with the studio. By June 1999, Neuman left for the Digital Entertainment Network. In 1999, after Disney&#x27;s &quot;Smart Guy&quot; was cancelled, all Disney shows for primetime would be produced under the Touchstone Television label.

=== Touchstone Television (ABC subsidiary) ===
In late 1999, Walt Disney Television Studios (also called Buena Vista Television Group or Buena Vista Television Productions), were transferred from the Disney Studios to the ABC Television Network to merge with ABC&#x27;s primetime division, ABC Entertainment, forming the ABC Entertainment Television Group. By then, the Walt Disney Television label was dropped and all primetime programming produced by Disney would use the &quot;Touchstone Television&quot; name. Shortly afterwards, writer Seth Kurland struck a deal with the studio to produce shows. Following Kurland&#x27;s deal, writer Don Reo, formerly of &quot;Lenny&quot; and &quot;Blossom&quot; when Witt-Thomas was producing for Disney also struck a deal with the studio. Around the same time, Touchstone Television sold the series, &quot;Daddio&quot; to NBC. The program lasted only nine episodes before NBC cancelled it.

In 2000, Touchstone Television created two departments for comedy in September, and a department for drama in December. Touchstone Television had infamously left the production of the CBS series &quot;&quot; in 2000, fearing it was a flop and sold Disney&#x27;s interest in the series to Alliance Atlantis. By 2001, Steve McPherson signed on as president of the television unit. While two of their pilots were in consideration to be picked up by ABC in April 2003, Tollin/Robbins Productions signed a two-year development deal with Touchstone Television, which included a two-year option, shares in profits and outside sales.

In 2004, &quot;Alias&quot; creator J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot production company had struck a development deal with Touchstone Television to produce television series. Also that year, Marc Cherry signed a development deal at the studio. The following year, the Russo brothers has struck a two-year deal with the studio, with veteran writer and producer Steven Bochco, who had produced several shows for ABC, signing a deal with the studio that same year to produce future shows. In 2006, Marti Noxon struck a deal with the studio to produce shows.

=== ABC Studios ===

In February 2007, Disney announced that Touchstone Television would be renamed ABC Television Studio as part of Disney&#x27;s push to drop secondary brands like Buena Vista in favor of the Disney, ABC and ESPN brands. By the time the name change was implemented that fall, the new name had been modified to ABC Studios.

On August 4, 2008, Lionsgate completed a deal with Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment, the distributor of ABC Studios/Touchstone Television shows on DVD, to acquire the distribution rights to several shows including &quot;According to Jim&quot;, &quot;Reaper&quot;, &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; and &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. At the same time, new DVDs of ABC and ABC Family shows phased out the Buena Vista Home Entertainment logo at the beginning of the disc and replaced it with the ABC Studios and ABC Family logos, respectively.

In June 2009, ABC Entertainment announced a new organization, effective immediately as ABC Entertainment Group, while consolidating back office functions like business affairs, distribution and scheduling of ABC Studios and ABC Entertainment and retaining separate creative units. In January 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced it was cutting 5% of its workforce. In October 2012, ABC Studios formed its Signature unit to sell to outside networks.

In early 2016, ABC Studios International (also referred to as ABC International Studios) was set up with the appointment of Keli Lee as its managing director of international content and talent, combined with her move to London. The unit, announced at MIPCOM in October 2016, would allow more overseas local productions, leveraging fellow Disney Media Network expertises in distribution and production for the local and international co-productions, IP reinventions, and original format acquisitions and productions. This would add to Disney-ABC&#x27;s international productions in Latin America, where the company has 16 years of producing local content. In April 2017, the international unit greenlit its first co-production, the Australian series &quot;Harrow&quot;. Lee signed a first look deal with Hoodlum Entertainment, the co-producers of &quot;Harrow&quot;, by February 2018. With ABC picking up the international unit&#x27;s &quot;Reef Break&quot; in August 2018, ABC Studios started co-producing.

In August 2017, Ryan Seacrest Productions left CBS at the end of their deal to move over to ABC Studios. Following the expansion of its cable/streaming unit, ABC Studios launched a new alternative division for the full range of unscripted work, from documentaries to game shows to social experiment series. The former executive vice president of development and production at Ryan Seacrest Productions, along with Fernando Hernandez, the former head of Universal Television Alternative Studios, were hired by the studio to lead the division around January 2018. This division was announced in October 2018 with a small slate under production executive Gareth Provan, and an in-house development group called The Originals Group. The division is tapping existing production companies with deals at ABC Studios, including Ryan Seacrest Productions, Larry Wilmore&#x27;s Wilmore Films and Bob Sertner Productions, in addition to partnerships that Hernandez has developed, including those with Mission Control Media, Parker Paige Media, INE Entertainment, and Party Pit Productions.

==== ABC Signature Studios ====

ABC Studios was moving to sell to outside networks. As the studios have placed the former ABC comedy &quot;Cougar Town&quot; at TBS, and &quot;Devious Maids&quot; at Lifetime, Signature was set up in October 2012 to continue the trend. In 2013, ABC Studios vice president of drama Tracy Underwood was appointed senior vice president of ABC Signature. Signature was incorporated on .

Signature developed &quot;Mistresses&quot;, which was included in ABC&#x27;s summer schedule and renewed for another season. In October 2013, the division placed its first outside project, &quot;Benched&quot;, for USA, with a pilot order that finished shooting by December. Other projects were in the works with A&amp;E, WE tv and TBS. In the works with ABC, Signature has a possible straight-to-series Stephen King story adaptation called &quot;Grand Central&quot;, based on &quot;The New York Times at Special Bargain Rates&quot;. Corporate sibling Freeform picked up &quot;Rated P For Parenthood&quot; for development as its first program from Signature in June 2014.

In April 2015, Signature and ABC Studios signed a two-year first-look with Black Label Media, started by Molly Smith, Trent Luckinbill and Thad Luckinbill three years prior as a finance and production company. McG&#x27;s Wonderland Sound &amp; Vision signed a two-year overall production agreement with Signature, Freeform and ABC Studios in October 2015. This follows two productions from McG on Freeform/ABC Family. Signature signed &quot;SMILF&quot; creator, executive producer and star Frankie Shaw to a two-year overall deal in July 2018. In March 2019, the deal was suspended following an investigation into allegations of misconduct against Shaw on the set of &quot;SMILF&quot;.

In April 2016, Freeform greenlit &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; with a straight-to-series order, as Marvel Television&#x27;s first co-production with Signature. Another co-production with Marvel Television was greenlit in August 2016, with &quot;Runaways&quot; confirmed for the Hulu streaming service. Signature also put a live-action Mighty Ducks series in development beginning in January 2018, which later ended up as a Disney+ original series called &quot;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers&quot;.

Signature is teaming with John Grisham, Hulu and Michael Seitzman&#x27;s Maniac Productions to create a Grisham Universe set of series. The franchise would begin with two series, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; and &quot;Rogue Lawyer&quot;, based on Grisham&#x27;s books, with a potential to grow to additional series. Hulu had dropped out of the Grisham Universe by September 5, 2019, with the pair being shopped given other interested outlets.

From its pilot, Signature&#x27;s &quot;The Wilds&quot;, a young adult drama, was picked up in May 2019 by Amazon, its first from the company. Underwood was promoted in February 2020 to the new position of executive vice president, creative affairs of ABC Studios to oversee development at ABC Studio in addition to managing ABC Signature.

=== Under Disney Television Studios ===
After the acquisition of 21st Century Fox completed on March 20, 2019, ABC Studios and ABC Signature Studios both became part of Disney Television Studios. In July 2019, Disney TV Studios announced a reorganization in executive leadership. Fox TV executives Jonnie Davis and Josh Sussman have replaced Patrick Moran and Howard Davine as president and executive vice president of business affairs of ABC Studios respectively. It was also announced that Amy Hartwick, the studio&#x27;s head of the comedy department, has exited. In September 2019, ABC Studios&#x27; alternative division head Hernandez exited the post, with ABC indicating that they would remain in the businesses.

ABC Studios International produced the anthology series &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; which was in development while the company was launching ABC Discover to find more British talent. In December 2019, an exodus of the international unit&#x27;s top executives including managing director Keli Lee occurred. However, no replacements have been named given a re-assessing of the unit is taking place.

On August 10, 2020, ABC Studios and ABC Signature were merged into one unit as part of a restructuring plan by Disney regarding their television production units; the merged company took on the latter&#x27;s name. Meanwhile, Fox 21 Television Studios was renamed Touchstone Television, restoring that brand name after a thirteen-year dormancy (only to be folded into 20th Television on December 1 that year), and 20th Century Fox Television was renamed 20th Television (the former name of that entity&#x27;s domestic syndication division, which in turn was absorbed into Disney–ABC Domestic Television).

On August 18, 2021, writers Jordan Reddout and Gus Hickey signed an overall deal with the studio. On October 29, 2021, writer-producer Lila Byock also signed an overall deal with the studio. Matt Lopez, creator/executive producer of &quot;Promised Land&quot;, also signed an overall deal with the studio the same year on November 17.

=== Shutdown ===
On October 1, 2024, Eric Schrier, president of Disney Television Studios &amp; Business Operations, announced that ABC Signature would be dissolved effective immediately, with its operations folded into sister company 20th Television. As a result, senior vice president Erin Wehrenberg will leave the company, with president Tracy Underwood transitioning to an overall producing deal with Disney Television Studios; multiple employees will be transferred to 20th Television.

<text>Vadims Vasiļevskis (born 5 January 1982) is a retired Latvian track and field athlete who competed in the javelin throw. He won silver at the 2004 Summer Olympics. His personal best throw of 90.73 m, set in 2007, is the Latvian record. In 2008, Vasiļevskis was awarded the Latvian Order of the Three Stars for his achievements in athletics.

== Career ==

He has been coached by Valentīna Eiduka. In his early career he finished eighth at the 2000 World Junior Championships and competed at the 2002 European Championships without reaching the final.

Vasiļevskis was the Latvian flag bearer at the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was the biggest surprise among Latvia&#x27;s medal winners in 2004 Olympics. Latvia had three competitors in javelin throw: Vasiļevskis, Ēriks Rags and Voldemārs Lūsis, with Vasiļevskis being the youngest and the least known of the three. In Olympics, Vasiļevskis was the best of the three, throwing for 84.95 metres, two and a half meters further than his previous personal best and good enough to win a silver medal.

After the Olympic silver he finished eighth at the 2004 World Athletics Final. After an unsuccessful 2005 World Championships where he did not reach the final round, he stood fourth in the 2006 European Championships, the 2006 World Athletics Final and the 2007 World Championships. He won a gold medal at the 2007 Summer Universiade, and finished ninth at the 2008 Olympic Games. He was the Latvian flag bearer at the 2008 Summer Olympics as well.

<text>William Meyers Colmer (February 11, 1890 – September 9, 1980) was an American politician from Mississippi.

Colmer was born in Moss Point, Mississippi, and attended Millsaps College. He served in the military during World War I.

Colmer was elected Jackson County attorney in 1921, becoming district attorney in 1928.

In 1932, Colmer was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat from Mississippi&#x27;s 6th District, located on the Gulf Coast. He was reelected 19 times. His district was renumbered the 5th after the 1960 Census, when Mississippi&#x27;s declining proportion of the US population due to the Great Migration cost it a congressional seat.

Originally elected as a supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal, Colmer became increasingly conservative as the years passed. He became disenchanted as the national Democratic Party began to support the Civil Rights Movement. After the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) decision by the United States Supreme Court, ruling that public school segregation was unconstitutional, Colmer helped to get Southern Democratic congressmen to sign the &quot;Southern Manifesto&quot; declaring their resistance. Colmer voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Colmer endorsed the unpledged electors slate in 1960, Republican Party presidential candidates Barry Goldwater in 1964, and Richard Nixon in 1972. Because of his seniority, he advanced to the position as chairman of the Rules Committee, serving from 1967 to 1973.
Colmer did not run for reelection in 1972. He endorsed his administrative assistant, Trent Lott, as his successor, although Lott ran as a Republican. Colmer served longer in the U.S. House of Representatives than anyone in Mississippi&#x27;s history except Jamie Whitten, who served 54 years in Congress from 1941 to 1995. (Fellow Mississippian John Stennis would serve over 41 years in the U.S. Senate from late 1947 until early 1989.)

<doc id="945453" wikidata="Q657972" url="?curid=945453" title="The Miracle Workers">
<text>The Miracle Workers were a rock and roll band in the 1980s, who began as a garage rock revival band in Portland, Oregon.

==Background==

The Miracle Workers were formed in January 1982 by Gerry Mohr (vocals), and Joel Barnett (bass guitar). The original guitarist and drummer, who were friends of Gerry&#x27;s, left the band early on. Matt Rogers, a friend of Joel&#x27;s, became the guitarist. Ron Sheridan became the drummer, though would later leave to pursue a business career. The band stabilized in 1984, with the addition of Dan Demiankow (guitar, organ), and Gene Trautmann (drums).

The Miracle Workers lineup in 1987 became Gerry Mohr (vocals), Matt Rogers (guitar), Robert Butler (bass), and Gene Trautmann (drums).

==Recording career==
Several songs on compilation LPs, with the band line up being Gerry, Matt, Joel, and Ron. Recordings from 1982.

*&quot;Miracle Workers&quot;, was a four-song EP on Moxie Records, released in 1984. Line up was Gerry Mohr, Joel Barnett, Matt Rogers, Danny Demiankow, and a short term drummer, Jeff Grassi.
*&quot;A Thousand Micrograms of the Miracle Workers&quot;, on Sounds Interesting Records, 1984, 6 song EP, marked Gene Trautmann&#x27;s recording debut with the band.
*&quot;Inside Out&quot;, Voxx/Bomp 1985 LP, was recorded in Los Angeles. This is the band&#x27;s most successful LP, and received critical acclaim in North America and Europe. It has since been re-issued on CD. Of all the recordings it is the easiest to find.

These recordings, and the band&#x27;s style was in line with contemporary garage rock revival acts, such as The Chesterfield Kings and Lyres.

The Miracle Workers&#x27; liking for harder edged, late-sixties/early-seventies bands such as the MC5, The Stooges, and Flamin&#x27; Groovies came to the fore. Their sound became very influenced by this and it can be heard on their LPs &quot;Live at the Forum&quot;, &quot;Overdose&quot;, &quot;Primary Domain&quot;, and &quot;Roll out the Red Carpet&quot;, with the first two being especially notable, regarding that influence.

The 1989 LP on Get Hip Records, &quot;Moxie&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, supplemented this period with outtakes and unreleased recordings.

==Los Angeles==
In the Spring of 1986, the band decided to move to Los Angeles. Joel Barnett left the band at that time. Robert Butler, from The Untold Fables, became the bass player and Dan Demiankow quit over musical differences. Due to internal problems within the band, they split up in 1992. The band came together back in Portland to record &quot;Anatomy of a Creep&quot; a year later. The Triple xxx recording would be their last, produced by Thee Slayer Hippie (Steve Hanford/Drummer Poison Idea) and involved original drummer Gene Trautmann, replacing Aaron Sperske who was relieved of duties near the time of recording &quot;Anatomy of a Creep&quot;.

==Break up and slow fade==
Gene Trautmann quit the band circa 1990 and was replaced on drums by Aaron Sperske. Aaron Played on the &quot;Roll Out the Red Carpet&quot; album. The Miracle Workers split in the early 1990s, but before calling it quits they returned to Portland and recorded a new CD, &quot;Anatomy of a Creep&quot;, for their label, Triple X. Gene Trautmann resumed drumming duties. This record was apparently issued, but in small quantities, as it is difficult to find.

Members of the group resurfaced in Portland, Oregon in the mid-1980s and in Switzerland in the late 1990s, in several bands playing blues, psychobilly, and garage rock, such as The Bo Diddley Headhunters; Cavemannish Boys; The Wicked Ones; The Get Lost and Queens of the Stone Age. In LA the band incorporated more hard rock and alternative rock influences paralleling the grunge scene in Seattle. The Miracle Workers were amongst the founding bands of the stoner rock movement.

In the late 1980s, alternative cartoonist Joe Sacco followed the band on their Europe tour, as T-shirt salesman and chronicling comics journalist. These comics have been collected in the compilation &quot;But I Like It&quot;, published by Fantagraphics in 2006.

<doc id="945454" wikidata="Q147541" url="?curid=945454" title="Lithuania at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Lithuania competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixth appearance at the Summer Olympics. The National Olympic Committee of Lithuania (, &quot;LTOK&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. A total of 59 athletes, 47 men and 12 women, competed in 13 sports, including the men&#x27;s basketball team as the nation&#x27;s team-based sport.

The Lithuanian squad featured returning Olympic medalists: discus thrower Virgilijus Alekna, trap shooter Daina Gudzinevičiūtė, and the men&#x27;s basketball team, being led by team captain Saulius Štombergas, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Along with Alekna, Stombergas, and Gudzineviciute, road cyclists and twin sisters Jolanta and Rasa Polikevičiūtė and javelin thrower Rita Ramanauskaitė made their third Olympic appearances as the most experienced members of the team. Other notable Lithuanian athletes included Stombergas&#x27; teammate and NBA basketball star Darius Songaila, track cyclist Simona Krupeckaitė, and two-time world champion Andrejus Zadneprovskis in men&#x27;s modern pentathlon.

Lithuania left Athens with a total of three medals (one gold and two silver), the lowest in its Summer Olympic history since the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. Discus thrower Alekna was originally placed in a silver medal spot, but eventually defended his Olympic title at the time of the medal ceremony, when Hungary&#x27;s Róbert Fazekas committed an anti-doping violation for failing to submit a proper urine sample during the test, which ended up in a disqualification. Meanwhile, heptathlete Austra Skujytė and modern pentathlete Zadneprovskis rounded out the Olympic podium with a silver medal each for the Lithuanian team.

==Athletics==

Lithuanian athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

Virgilijus Alekna was originally placed in a silver medal position in the men&#x27;s discus throw. A few days before the medal ceremony took place, Hungary&#x27;s Róbert Fazekas committed an anti-doping violation by failing to submit a proper urine sample during the test, and was eventually expelled from the Games, lifting Alekna&#x27;s position to a gold medal and more importantly, a defense for his Olympic title.

<doc id="945457" wikidata="Q1985737" url="?curid=945457" title="Cluemaster">
<text>The Cluemaster (Arthur Brown) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman as well as a recurring enemy of Tim Drake, the third Robin. Cluemaster first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #351 (May 1966) and was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino.

A failed game show host, the character became a criminal who leaves clues to his crimes, but unlike the Riddler&#x27;s clues, they are not in the form of riddles. He is also the father of Stephanie Brown who became the vigilante Spoiler and later the fourth Robin and third Batgirl.

Cluemaster appeared in the second season of the Arrowverse series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, portrayed by Rick Miller. Ethan Embry portrayed Arthur Brown in &quot;Gotham Knights&quot;.

==Publication history==
Cluemaster first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #351 (May 1966) and was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino.

==Fictional character biography==
The Cluemaster starts his criminal campaign by a daring but unsuccessful attempt to learn Batman&#x27;s identity and gain a fighting edge. He returns to Gotham for a rematch with Batman, then appears in several supervillain crowd scenes over the years.

With several other villains, Cluemaster becomes a member of the Injustice League, a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, when banding together, become even less successful than they have been in their individual careers. The Injustice League have been defeated time and again by the Justice League International, at least when they are not making laughingstocks of themselves. Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the equally laughable hero team Justice League Antarctica. They help out the Justice League when JLI liaison Maxwell Lord lies in a coma, but again later reform as the Injustice League as henchmen of Sonar.

Cluemaster reappears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #647 by Chuck Dixon and Tom Lyle. In this three-issue story, Cluemaster has reformed and been released from Blackgate Penitentiary. Cured of his compulsion to leave clues, Cluemaster originally joins a gang and plans their heists in exchange for 10 percent of their winnings. He later kills the leader by suffocating him with a strong polymer over his mouth and nose, and begins to plan a master heist.

During this time, it is revealed Arthur Brown has a daughter named Stephanie through a woman named Crystal Brown, but rarely spends any time with her due to long periods of incarceration. Stephanie is furious when she discovers that he has returned to crime without his need to leave clues behind. Making a costume for herself, she calls herself The Spoiler, finds out her father&#x27;s plans, and leaves clues so that the police and Batman can stop him. Robin spots Spoiler on the rooftops during a police bust of Cluemaster&#x27;s apartment and unmasks her, though she incapacitates Robin by hitting him in the face with a brick. Robin tracks her down and Batman, Robin and Spoiler set a plan in motion to take down Cluemaster. Spoiler was forbidden from going to the bust because she was only motivated by revenge. Catching Cluemaster at his mall heist whilst he hauls a giant glass canister of money away by air, Stephanie is then held hostage by Cluemaster atop the canister, holding a vial of acid to her face as Batman tries to stop him. Batman tells Cluemaster to stop and Cluemaster, thinking Batman will only lecture him about how it is morally wrong to disfigure a child, is taken aback when Batman simply reveals Spoiler is his daughter. Spoiler uses the shock of the revelation to gain the upper hand and uses one of the chains attached to the Gunship lifting the canister to strangle Cluemaster, but Batman prevents this. Cluemaster is taken back to Blackgate.

Each time the Cluemaster escapes or start some new plan, Stephanie dons her costume again to foil him. Eventually, she realizes she enjoys being a hero, and begins regular patrols as Spoiler. For a brief period of time she even replaces her boyfriend, Tim Drake, as Robin.

===Apparent death===

Cluemaster and his teammates in the Injustice League volunteer to join the second Suicide Squad, a group sanctioned by the US government, in return for a full pardon of his crimes. The Cluemaster also hopes to make Stephanie proud of him. During the mission, which involves dealing with terrorists and a lovesick genetic experiment, Cluemaster sees his friends, Big Sir, Clock King and Multi-Man die (though Multi-Man has the power to be reborn). In the resulting chaotic battle, Cluemaster seemingly saves Major Disaster&#x27;s life twice, though the Major admits the situation was confusing. Cluemaster is seen shot many times through the chest. He survives this incident, with a year&#x27;s recuperation in the hospital and many, many scars. He is encouraged by thoughts of his daughter.

When he escapes and discovers that his daughter has been killed, he takes on the secret identity Aaron Black and creates the &quot;Campaign for Culpability&quot;, blaming Batman for his involvement in Stephanie&#x27;s death, saying that she was not the first child working with Batman to die, and that Batman should be brought to justice.

It is later revealed that Stephanie survived the incident that everyone believed had killed her, and spent some time recuperating overseas.

&quot;Robin&quot; (vol. 2) #177 was planned by Chuck Dixon intended to feature Cluemaster, but Dixon&#x27;s abrupt exodus from DC meant the issue was scrapped.

Cluemaster finally reappears after Stephanie Brown has become the new Batgirl. He is revealed to be a sponsor of the Reapers, a group of young supervillains who have been battling Batgirl.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, as part of the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Cluemaster is among the villains that the Crime Syndicate of America recruited to join the Secret Society of Super Villains.

Cluemaster appears as a villain in &quot;&quot;, plotting with several other minor villains when interrupted by his daughter, Stephanie Brown, who overhears part of the plotting by her father and his associates. This is Cluemaster&#x27;s first full appearance in the New 52 continuity. He is later revealed to be the final mastermind behind the systematic attack on Batman by various villains; inspired by an old theory he had when talking with other lower-grade villains that they could take action while Batman was occupied with the bigger criminals, he sent out invitations to other big-league foes to take action after the fall of Commissioner Gordon, and then all he had to do was slip a basic mind-control drug into Gordon&#x27;s coffee to make him see a threat that wasn&#x27;t there and let the other villains do what they wanted, guessing correctly that Batman would never think to look at a small-timer when so many bigger villains were playing a part in the scheme. Although Brown manages to capture and unmask Batman, Bruce is able to escape his bonds and fight back, but he has taken such a beating over the course of the storyline that Cluemaster manages to overpower him, only for Lincoln March to show up behind Cluemaster and slit his throat, revealing that he funded Cluemaster&#x27;s plans solely so that he could kill Batman at this point in secret.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. During &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot;, Cluemaster is seen as a member of Joker&#x27;s team. After Batman joins the war on the side of the Riddler and begins taking out Joker’s allies one by one, Cluemaster suggests to Kite Man that they let themselves be beaten rather than flee and face the wrath of both kingpins. However, he is then gassed by the Scarecrow, one of Riddler’s allies, and taken out of the conflict.

In a three-issue story arc beginning in &quot;Batgirls&quot; #13 (February 2023) Cluemaster kidnaps Stephanie but is thwarted by Cassandra Cain.

==Powers and abilities==
Unlike most of Batman&#x27;s villains, Cluemaster is completely sane, which gives him a unique relationship with Batman. Cluemaster has no metahuman powers or abilities. He has a number of plasti-glass pellets attached to the front of his uniform. The pellets contain various offensive weaponry including: blinding incendiary flares, smoke, incapacitating gas, and explosives.

<text>Marketing communications (MC, marcom(s), marcomm(s) or just simply communications) refers to the use of different marketing channels and tools in combination. Marketing communication channels focus on how businesses communicate a message to their desired market, or the market in general. It can also include the internal communications of the organization. Marketing communication tools include advertising, personal selling, direct marketing, sponsorship, communication, public relations, social media, customer journey and promotion.

MC are made up of the marketing mix which is made up of the 4 Ps: Price, Promotion, Place and Product, for a business selling goods, and made up of 7 Ps: Price, Promotion, Place, Product, People, Physical evidence and Process, for a service-based business.

==Overview==

Marketing communications include advertising, promotions, sales of products, Branding , advertising campaign, events, and online promotions. The process allows the public to know or understand a brand and get a clear idea of what the brand has to offer. Brand awareness is the first stage, then brand preference over its competitors is the desired outcome. With growing technology and techniques, the direct participation of customers is made. This is done by including their ideas and creations in product development and brand promotion. Successful branding involves targeting audiences who appreciate the organization&#x27;s mission and vision, business values and marketing program.

Advertising is a small but important part of marketing communications; the marketing communications mix is a set of tools that can be used to deliver a clear and consistent message to target audiences. It is also commonly called the promotional mix. Crosier (1990) states that all terms have the same meaning in the context of the 4ps: product, price, place and promotion. Price can send a message to the target audience. For example, comparing a $50 bag to a $10 bag, the former may be viewed as a luxury or more durable item. The higher goal of advertising is to establish a relationship between the brand and its target market.

The marketing plan identifies key opportunities, threats, weaknesses, and strengths, sets objectives, and develops an action plan to achieve marketing goals. Each section of the 4P&#x27;s sets its own objective; for instance, the pricing objective might be to increase sales in a certain geographical market by pricing their own product or service lower than their competitors. This creates a significant change in the market because more people in the target market would aim to do business with your organization than with your competitors because pricing is one of the most significant aspects of marketing that can change the whole market positively or negatively.

==Definitions==
*Communication barriers: Communication barriers are factors that hinder the objectives of marketing communication. Major communication barriers are Noise and clutter, consumer apathy, brand parity, and weak information design, creative ideas, or strategies. Noise is an unrelated sensory stimulus that distracts a consumer from the marketing message (for example, people talking nearby making it hard to hear a radio advertisement). Clutter is the high number and concentration of advertisements presented to a consumer at any time. As attention cannot be divided, there is a limit to how much can be taken in and processed, which means that strong marketing communication needs to stand out from the clutter and be heard above the noise.
**&quot;Consumer apathy&quot; is the tendency of a consumer to avoid marketing communications. The consumer may not be interested, or consider themselves &quot;in the market,&quot; and as such attempt to shut out the irrelevant marketing stimuli; this is known as selective attention. Alternatively, a consumer may be &quot;in the market,&quot; yet not be aware of the brand or product&#x27;s existence or prevalence. Consumers tend to purchase familiar brands, and will not be inspired to investigate alternatives. One approach marketers use to overcome apathy is to create incentives, such as competitive pricing or loyalty rewards.
**Brand parity means a brand is not significantly different from its competition. Without a distinct value proposition, consumers do not develop brand preference or associations and instead purchase purely based on price. This is not ideal, as effective marketing communication increases brand equity. One important objective of marketing communications is to develop a strong, unique brand identity that allows the brand to be positioned separately from its competition.
*Marketing mix is the most important part of marketing strategy, which is &quot;the framework to manage marketing and incorporate it within a business context&quot;. 
*Marketing strategy: how a business achieves its marketing objectives. The initial step to achieve a marketing strategy is to identify the market target and build up a business plan.
*Marketing Research does not involve a proven order of steps resulting in an ultimate inference. It is a repeated process that requires a broader outlook. At times, projects may require going in-depth and changing the entire process. Let us take the example of Nokia when they were preparing themselves to compete against the smartphone market. In November 2011, they decided on coming up with something new, especially targeting the youth, who were switching over to the Finnish Smartphones. This switchover required several changes, starting from brand fundamentals to training in-house teams, from targeting to product advancement, and from hiring talented marketing people to new innovations.

==Communications==
Communication is one important aspect of the marketing mix. Marketing communication is often the largest component of communication within a company, which may be to present company values, objectives or specific products and services to investors, customers or the general public. In the 21st century, communications objectives focus on more customized messages, targeting customer groups or individuals to create high responses and greater brand interaction.

As business becomes increasingly global with greater access to the Internet, mobile phones and social media, new challenges exist to inform people in targeted foreign markets. Shifts in the global economy and access to new markets lead also to greater demands for product shipping and associated services. To be effective, marketing communications must be tailored to its channels. For example: the public relations messaging set is customized to its target audience which is media and the industry, the messaging will be about data proofed achievements, whereas in social media messaging content is more friendly and about the brand&#x27;s soft qualities. communication strategies must converge with marketing objectives while also accounting for local languages, dialects and cultural norms. 

External communications might involve market research questionnaires, an office website, guarantees, company annual reports and presentations for investors. Internal communication can be marketing materials, price lists, product catalogs, sales presentations and management communications. On the other hand, each market demands different types of communications. For example, the industrial market demands more personal communication but the consumer market demands non-personal communication.

=== Types of communication ===
There are also 4 different fundamental types of communication.
*One-to-many: this kind of communication is the most original communication. It is &quot;generated from a single broadcast point and then available over airwaves or in mass print runs&quot;. This type of communication is usually adapted to news distribution that is not specific, not even interactive. Such as in an urgent notice play over airwave from broadcast in an industry, it is helpful for the general announcement.
*Many-to-one: many-to-one is usually connected to the one-to-many communication. For example, a reply button in your email box, a prepaid number bought from Spark. All the communication techniques proceeded to the public with bi-directional communication from mass communications.
*One-to-one: this is the most intensive and interactive communication at a one-to-one level. There are so many examples like a sales presentation; a negotiation in the market or direct delivery is based on one-to-one communication. Most of this communication is face-to-face. But with the development of the Internet, email and online shopping are taking the chance to be face to face with people. Which provided the chance for sellers and buyers to talk more directly. Another important is instant message &#x27;chat&#x27; channels like Wechat and Facebook, which are becoming extremely popular in business.
*Many-to-many: on the background of the highly developed Internet, the many-to-many communication has been growing up such as online chat rooms, &#x27;blogging&#x27; websites. The many-to-many communication stands for the participants being able to exchange their ideas and experiences.

One-to-one is more immediate, while the many-to-many channels tend to be less urgent but with greater longevity.

===Psychology of communication===
One of the primary goals of marketing communication is to persuade consumers or businesses, by either changing their perception of a brand, product, or service or persuading them to purchase (or feel motivated / tempted to purchase) a product or service. The &quot;Elaboration Likelihood Model&quot; is used to demonstrate how persuasion occurs. When a marketing communication message is sent out, first it must be acknowledged and attended by the receiver. By giving their attention to marketing communication, consumers will begin to process and comprehend the message. There are two routes to persuasion: Central and peripheral. Central route processing is used in high-involvement purchase decisions. These are infrequent, high-risk purchases, usually involving large amounts of money and a significant amount of time (for example, purchasing a house or car). Because these purchase decisions are high risk, a large cognitive effort is expended in order to rationally select the most logical and valuable option available. In these marketing messages, information about the product or service itself is most valuable. 
Peripheral route processing is employed in low involvement purchase decisions. These are frequent, low-risk purchases, generally of a low or medium cost in which choices are made more on affective (or emotion-based) values rather than cognitive (or rational) values. Because of this, marketing messages will employ more storytelling and imagery, focusing on how the product or service makes one feel, and the associations it has, rather than the attributes and specifications it possesses.

==== Linguistic devices and modes of persuasion ====
A big part of marketing is how companies communicate, whether that be with clients and potential customers or internally with other departments within the business. When companies advertise, they can utilize linguistic devices to persuade the targeted audience; Different devices can produce differing effects. One of the linguistic device categories is a simple language. The different devices under simple language include phonetic symbolism, numbers, sound repetition, and pronunciation. All four devices use the cognitive effort of automatic processing. Phonetic symbolism is &quot;a non-arbitrary relation between sound and meaning, and suggests that the sound of a word can convey meaning apart from its definition&quot;. Back vowels and consonants are lower in pitch due to the positioning of the tip of the tongue being further back in the throat. These sounds are associated with heaviness, masculinity, and psychological distance. Conversely, front vowels and consonants are higher in pitch and associated with closeness, femininity, and light. The sound of a brand name can influence the perception of the brand from the consumers&#x27; perspective along with product attitude and product recommendations. This being said, when a brand name sound preference is in alignment with the consumers&#x27; preference, the perception of the preferred attributes is enhanced.

==Communication process==
Communication can be defined as the process of using, word, sound, or visual cues to supply information to one or more people. A communication process is defined as information that is shared with the intent that the receiver understands the message that the business intended to send. The communication process was once thought of as having the source of the message, which is then encoded, put through the chosen communication channel, which is then decoded by the recipient and then received. Throughout the middle of the channel there is the potential for noise to distort the message being sent. Once the receiver has the message they then give feedback to the original source, where they then find out whether the campaign has been successful or not.

With the prevalent use of technology, customers are seeking out information about brands, products, and businesses prior to purchase. This means that there is a need for an additional channel within the communication process, so it is a more accurate representation of the current business environment. Businesses are now having to take into consideration both opinion leaders and opinion formers who have a great influence over today&#x27;s society and their perceptions. So they have to be included in the communication process before the recipient of the message receives it.

This model is more effective when there is common ground between the senders and receivers so they can communicate effectively. Choosing the appropriate source helps develop the message and appeal to the targeted audience. The source will be more effective if they are relatable to the target audience. This realm of understanding is represented by overlapping circles. The more knowledge the source has about who they are targeting, the better they can understand how the receiver may interpret or react to the message.

The components of the transactional model are:
*Source: The source is an individual or organization that has information to share. The source (or sender) creates and sends the information to another person or group of people. The source may be an individual (e.g. a salesperson or spokesperson) or a non-personal identity (e.g. a corporation or organization). The communication process begins with the source, marketers must carefully choose a source as it affects how the message will be perceived by the target audience.
*Encoding: This is transposing the intended meaning of the message with words, symbols, or pictures to show a message. Encoding is the development of the message that contains the information the source hopes to convey. It is putting together the thoughts, ideas, and information into a symbolic form that can be transmitted and understood by the receiver. Encoding the message is the second step in the communication process. The encoding process leads to the development of a message that contains the information or meaning the source hopes to convey. Encoding is extremely important, it is a brain activity that takes effect when the receiver makes sense of a brand message or idea used to convey meaning: words, color, pictures, signs, symbols, or even music. The message may be verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, or symbolic (e.g. the sound of a brass band being redolent of simpler times or heritage). or it can often include &#x27;cues&#x27; such as the Nike &#x27;swoosh&#x27; which indicates success. Often things can get in the way of the &quot;correct&quot; encoding and the interpretation of the intended message (decoding). There are methods the sender can use to make sure the receiver interprets the message correctly, these methods include; channels, consumer insights, having similarities with the receiver, and frame of reference (e.g. age, values, culture). Finally, it is extremely important for the sender to get to know its receiver and this is accomplished through research for targeting strategy. These concepts help craft the intended message in the minds of the consumer.
*Message: The message comes from the encoding process, it is the content, meaning, or information the sources hope to convey. The message can be in many forms such as verbal, non-verbal, oral, written, or symbolic.
*Channel: The channel is the method by which the communication travels from the source or sender to the receiver. There are two types of channels, personal and non-personal. Personal channels of communication are direct and target individual groups. Personal communication channels are connected with two or more persons who communicate directly with each other face-to-face, person-to-person through telephone, email, or fax. Social channels also fall under the category of personal communications. Friends, neighbors, associates, co-workers, or family members are all means of social channels. Carrying a message without interpersonal contact between sender and receiver is known as non-personal channels of communication. Mass media or mass communications are examples of non-personal channels since the message is sent to many individuals at one time. Non-personal channels of communication are made up out of two main types, the first being print. Print media includes newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and billboards. The second type is broadcast; broadcast media includes radio and television.
*Decoding: The receiver unravels the symbols to interpret what is being communicated. Transforming the sender&#x27;s message back into thought. This is influenced greatly by the receiver&#x27;s frame of reference (or realm of understanding) which involves their values, attitudes and state of mind when receiving the message. For the model to be effective the decoding by the receiver would match the encoding by the source, meaning they correctly understand the message that was sent. Decoding is the process of interpreting messages and relies on correct encoding and the ability of the receiver to deconstruct transmitted meaning. Decoding occurs when the message reaches one or more of the receiver&#x27;s senses. Consumers both hear and see television ads, others consumers handle (touch) and read (see) an advertising offer (e.g. coupon). According to Belch &amp; Belch this process is deeply influenced by the receiver&#x27;s frame of reference or field of experience, which refers to the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and values he or she brings to the communication situation. For effective communication to occur, the message decoding process of the receiver must match the encoding of the sender. Over this entire means the receiver comprehends and correctly translates what the source is trying to communicate. Effective communication is more likely to emerge when there is some common ground between the two parties. The more familiarity the sender has about the receivers, the better the sender can understand their needs, communicate with them, and overall communicate more effectively.
*Receiver: The individual (s) that the source shares thoughts or information with. The receiver hears, sees or reads the message and decodes it.
*Noise: Noise is any external interference during this communication process. Any external factors that create unplanned distortion. This distortion can make it difficult for the receiver to interpret or assign meaning to a message as it was intended by the source. Examples of noise in the encoding of the message could be lack of radio or television signal. Noise can also occur when the sender and receivers fields of experience do not overlap, if there is no common ground between them, which may result in a misunderstanding in the meaning of the message. Throughout the communication process, the message is subject to irrelevant factors that can distort or interfere with its reception. Noise is the physical or Psychological fundamentals either from inside or outside of the process of communication. Noise acts as a barrier as it makes the message less accurate, less productive and unclear. It may even prevent the message from ever reaching the receiver. Physical noise is often triggered by badly made images or messages (e.g. poor print quality) or elements of distraction (e.g. consumer scrolling through TV advertisements). Psychological noise could be mixed meanings, poor credibility of source or the insignificance of the message to the consumer requirements. Not having a connection with the receiver and lacking in common ground usually cause this. This may result in unsuitable encoding of the message such as; using a sign, symbol, or word that is unfamiliar or has a different meaning to the receiver (e.g. sending a message in a foreign language that is not understood by the receiver). The more common ground there is between the sender and the receiver, the less likely it is for noise and barriers to interrupt a message.
*Response/Feedback: The receiver&#x27;s reaction to the message provides feedback to the sender. This is the set of reactions after seeing, hearing or reading the message. The receiver&#x27;s response is the feedback and lets the sender know how the message was decoded and received. A form of feedback in an interpersonal selling situation could be questions, comments or any reactions (such as expressions) about the message. In mass media, an indication of how the marketing communications were perceived is the amount of sales after the message has been sent. There are many different ways such as attitude change, store visits and inquiries that provide feedback in mass media. Feedback can help to improve the communication process and the success of future messages. The receiver&#x27;s particular type of reaction after seeing, hearing, or reading a message is known as a response. Receivers&#x27; responses can range from either non-noticeable actions or noticeable actions. Non-noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response. Receiving feedback can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check coupon redemption, use reply cards and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments.

===Opinion leaders and opinion formers===
Opinion leaders are consumers who have large influence over the purchasing behavior of other consumers. These can be peers or celebrities, and often represent a &quot;desired state&quot; in the eye of the influenced consumer. By following the consumption patterns of opinion leaders, consumers aspire to achieve a similar status or lifestyle, and project a similar image. Because of this, opinion leaders are powerful factors in marketing communications. Having opinion leaders endorse a brand can increase brand awareness and sales. Due to this, large companies pay highly influential celebrities to endorse their products.

You can receive the opinion leaders&#x27; thoughts or feelings towards the product/service through paid advertising, social media, blogs, or any other form of written media. These can be direct, or indirect influences.

Opinion formers are consumers who are regarded by their peers as being highly knowledgeable and trustworthy. They are considered experts in selecting the highest quality products due to their extensive knowledge, and as such are able to influence the purchasing behavior of other consumers despite lacking the celebrity status of an opinion leader. They have specialized knowledge about the area which corresponds with the product, service or business. For example, this could be a doctor sponsoring a form of medication, or a personal trainer recommending a sports brand to the customer. This means that both opinion leaders and opinion formers have a large influence on the consumer and their perceived view of the business, product, or service provided. If a brand is specializing in the sale and manufacturing of makeup products, the business would want to look at someone who is both known for their knowledge about makeup and also someone who they know is popular within that community, so that the message is as widespread throughout their target market as possible.
Opinion leaders add another link in the communication process, acting as a &quot;meaning filter&quot; for the receivers of the message. The message is sent from the sender and the opinion leaders share their opinions with the targeted audience.

==Mass media==
===Television===

Television has since its inception dominated the advertising media scene, due to its combination of visual and aural stimulation, allowing for greater attention grabbing and more effective transmission of messages than other forms of media. It has a few disadvantages: television commercials suffer from being &quot;zipped&quot; and zapped&quot;. &quot;Zipping&quot; is the term given to fast forwarding commercial break sessions during the pre-recording of programs. Often viewers will record programs purely so they can be viewed without the commercial breaks. &quot;Zapping&quot; is the term given to the habit of many consumers to change channels during commercial breaks. This is also done to avoid watching advertisements. Using television advertisements is beneficial due to its wide reach and the degree to which content can be segmented according to the intended target market. Advertisements are carefully paired with time segments and / or linked with appropriate programming, known as &quot;media vehicles&quot;. This helps to ensure the intended audience is being reached with the marketing message.

While initial production costs of a television advertisement are high, it is likely to reach a mass audience and, therefore, maintains a low cost per viewer, making it an efficient communication platform.

===Radio===

Radio by definition is the broadcasting of sound programs to the public and today can be live streamed through a broadband connection or digitally transmitted into people&#x27;s cars or homes. Despite being the oldest form of media transmission still being used, marketing via radio remains a popular and effective choice due to its relatively lower cost and convenience (radio exposure can occur during transit, at work, and during recreational activities). Due to the lack of a visual aspect, radio advertising attempts to create imagery in the consumer&#x27;s mind. Radio advertising is also extremely effective at reinforcing messages encountered in other channels (such as television). A familiar jingle or voice associated with a brand enhances brand and ad awareness, ultimately increasing brand equity. This is an example of &quot;Integrated Marketing Communications&quot;, in which multiple marketing channels are simultaneously utilized to increase the strength and reach of the marketing message. Like television, radio marketing benefits from the ability to select specific time slots and programs (in this case in the form of radio stations and segments within).

Fill et al. argue that radio communication promotes &quot;emotional consumer–centric associations&quot; as each listener is forced to construct a visual representation of the words and sounds such as music in their minds. A common technique used by companies is known as imagery transfer, where a complementary visual television advertisement is used alongside a one-dimensional radio advertisement featuring a similar audio track to stimulate a visual association between the two. Research suggests this sub-conscience relational thought process greatly benefits future brand recognition and awareness.

Radio infomercials are often a simple script that is read out by the presenter. This is quick and does not require extensive lead times due to minimal production efforts.

===Print===
Printed media is the most basic form of media advertising. It is the most challenging to create strong imagery with, due to its lack of sensory stimulation, but can be effective in efficient, clear information communication and message delivery. Where a consumer may miss a message in video promoted by ads or audio (A loud noise interrupts, or someone blocks their view) in print the message remains visible indefinitely. Aspects such as size, color and style can be used to increase effectiveness relative to other print advertisements, which is important as despite being a basic media communication channel, print is the second largest medium after television.

Traditionally, marketing communications practitioners focused on the creation and execution of printed marketing collateral. Traditional media, or as some refer to as old media, has been used within the marketing and advertising world for many years. Traditional media encompasses conventional forms of advertising media, such as television, magazines, newspapers, radio, and direct mail and outdoor. For many decades, these forms of communication have been the main source for marketers to reach both consumers and other companies. In a world with no internet and the vast world of social media, roots of advertising and promotion lie within traditional media, where there is a more direct, physical way of advertising.

Advertising in the form of print is used by businesses in the form of billboards and posters, as well as magazines and newspapers, to get their message across to the target audience. Businesses will usually place a billboard in areas where it can be easily seen and where the target audience will spend their daily activities. Newspapers, magazines and posters are smaller in size and can be found in numerous places allowing the general public to read them. Depending on the product or service that is being advertised, marketers may specify where the majority of their prints may go to, such as advertisements of a new shampoo promoting more common within salons.

Print media are highly customizable, varying in print size, font, positioning and color combination. Newspapers commonly use coarse paper and tend to have poor reproduction quality, while magazines can enhance the appearance of a certain product due to the heavy weight gloss paper used which translates color well and offers a long lasting quality and likeability. Magazines function as a frame, a psychological device which manipulates perspective and judgement. For example, Vogue, a leading paid circulation fashion magazine, publishes advertising efforts alongside beautiful imagery and elegant photography, the association of the two communicates respectability and sophistication and promotes the credibility of the brands which appear in the same publication. Due to the high-quality reproduction, magazines tend to last longer and are often found in hair salons and waiting rooms. Consumers often cut out individual images which further prolongs the message and increases potential exposure. Although the relevance of the message may be lost during this extended time, brand awareness may still be raised.

Magazines are often segmented by subjects such as women&#x27;s health, automotive or fashion and therefore effectively reach a particular target market. Newspapers focus on geographical regions which tend to appeal to a broad representative population sample, offering low impact in selectivity. Newspapers are often run on a weekly schedule offering up-to-date information and coverage of local events and businesses as a lower cost alternative to other forms of media. Such advertisements are in smaller typeface and are black and white.

===Decline===
Past forms of media are said by many to be gradually losing effectiveness as more contemporary forms become more popular. This change is driven by two key factors: audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content. Television, radio, magazines, and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more selective audiences. The rapid growth of communication due to interactive messaging, particularly the internet, had caused the changes in the use of communication throughout promotion mediums, with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods. Consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication. Many marketers believe that traditional techniques of advertising have become too expensive and not cost-effective compared to modern ones. Older forms of marketing communications such as TV and newspaper advertising are one way in nature, whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions.

==Modes of communication and advertisement==
Communication platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, Skype, or other types of media have become an extremely important means of communication. Although there are other methods of communications that aren&#x27;t related to social media, people can be hugely influenced by their peers. This process is known as social mediation. Marketing communication platforms personalizes and expends marketing contents in an automated fashion based on the profile of the recipients.

A platform functions as a similar principle in marketing communications, providing awareness and information about a specific brand or product. Strategic selection of various communication platforms is known as a media strategy which aims to engage an audience in a conversation and, as a result, attempt to create a lasting relationship. Modern technology has expanded the use of platforms and ways in which consumers and the brand can interact. As a result, the context of platforms and how they are defined has changed. There are various platforms by which communication is transmitted, and these can be categorized as paid, owned, earned, or shared, formally named as the integrated communication triangle by Grönroos and Lindberg-Repo. The model acknowledges that communication must be credible and trustworthy to be effective. Studies reveal that many consumers look at review forums and ask friends or peers whom they trust for ratings on products before making a purchase decision. Therefore, effective communication relies on an integrated approach of one dimensional and interactive platforms.

Explicitly planned market content is shared through non-personal communication platforms. The brand controls the platform, message content, frequency and repetition of the communication message. These factors are typically accomplished through traditional paid platforms, such as print, electronic, outdoor and alternative media, that aims to target a mass segment of the market.

Other aspects of noise decrease the effectiveness of message penetration. For example, most paid communication platforms, print, and electronic media are filled with marketing and advertising messages and are subject to clutter, often forcing brands to compete for attention. To eliminate noise, brands often choose to include inserts such as samples and scent strips within magazines while newspapers utilize &quot;call to action&quot; inserts such as coupons which encourage consumers to visit or try a local service or good.

===Social media===
Social media&#x27;s market penetration is rising thanks to services like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Snapchat and TikTok. Companies are using these external platforms to engage existing and future customers, reinforce brand messaging, influence customer opinions, provide target offers, and serve customers more efficiently. Social media are flexible communication tools that go beyond the traditional means of advertising and allow brands to interact with their audience personally or professionally.

Influencer Marketing used to be focused on applying celebrity endorsement to help to influence audiences. Nowadays, with the growing outreach of social media, &quot;common people&quot; like bloggers are becoming popular and are connected with brands and products as influencers. Companies are beginning to invest time and money creating influence through resonance and reach. Return on Influence is not metrically trackable like Return on Investment is, but mechanisms such as links with UTM parameters can be created to track conversion behavior of influence.

=== The internet ===
The Internet features both non-personal and personal forms of communication. It has become one of the most dominant sources of information for most consumers. Belch &amp; Belch explained that the internet is mostly a non-personal form of communication as consumers absorb information online with no personal contact between the consumer and the organizations that are providing the information on their websites. However, as the internet develops, it is including personal communication as consumers interact with marketers online as well as communicate and share information with one another through the use of social media.

The Internet allows multimedia documents to be shared among its users. approximately 30 million websites have been registered worldwide and 650 million were connected to the Internet. The Internet as a marketing tool can be used to reach and inform customers directly, create brand loyalty, and build relationships. Online advertising includes elements such as: graphic images as website banners, pop-up advertisements, homepage restyling and anchor deals (co-operation between two organizations ).

====Interactivity====
Interactivity is a characteristic feature of the Internet that was described in 1996 by John Deighton. He argued that in the then-new Internet business environment, clients rather than the marketers usually start the interaction, by actively looking for the information that they need. Moreover, personal responses of customers will be collected by corporations and their individual demands will be met according to their desires.

On the one hand, traditional media are &quot;push&quot; formats where marketers broadcast their messages to customers, but do not allow direct feedback. The interaction between the two parties is few and far between. On the other hand, Internet media have the attribute of &quot;pull&quot; where customers have the freedom to search for whatever they wish. For instance, whenever a consumer types &quot;flower&quot; Google&#x27;s search engine, an advertisement of a specific flower shop might be placed on the top or bottom of the search result page by the Google AdWords program. Google makes use of the client&#x27;s search history and location to place an appropriate ad. The traditional one-way &quot;push&quot; communication is supplanted by the more productive two-way &quot;push and pull&quot; interaction.

====Individualization====
Compared with the traditional media where the same information is received by all consumers, As another advantage of two-way interaction, internet media can carry information &quot;tailored&quot; to the needs of a specific consumer. One of the first and most prominent examples is the personalized service provided by Amazon in which consumers are called by their names and &quot;tailored&quot; recommendations are provided according to their previous purchase records. Furthermore, besides &quot;tailored&quot; individual service, with the accumulation of consumers&#x27; information on the Internet, mass customization becomes possible in which companies provide &quot;tailored&quot; content to particular segments of consumers with similar interests. Douban is a Chinese social networking service website that allows its users to rate movies, TV dramas, music and concerts. It rapidly grew to 200 million registered users in 2013 (founded in 2005). In addition, people who like the same TV drama, like &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, or fans of the same movie star, such as Tom Cruise, will group together to discuss and share their feelings. This allows companies to take advantage of mass customization to sell products or reinforce their brand equity in suitable target groups. By doing so, the interaction and co-operation of companies and consumers are deepening, widening and multiplying in a variety of ways.

====Industry restructuring====
Restructuring followed by disintermediation and reintermediation is one of the essential features of the transition from traditional to Internet marketing communications. The Internet may force traditional distributors or retailers out of business simply because Internet transactions are less costly. JD.com significantly impacted the distribution channels for personal computers in China as of 2009 by allowing consumers to order different parts of the computers that were then assembled by the online business, leaving tens of thousands of retailers in that field out of their jobs. In 2015, JD.com accounted for 22.9% of the Chinese online shopping&#x27;s market share. Again, according to &quot;Financial Times&quot;, with the shifting trend of using mobile phones for online purchase in China, the people using cellphones to log on to the Internet outnumbered those using PC, the next wave of restructuring faced by JD.com and its major competitors like Alibaba. In 2014, JD.com&#x27;s orders deriving from mobile phones increased by 543%, compared with the last year&#x27;s quarter of the same period. Haoyu Shen, the chief executive of the JD.com, ascribed this result to its own company&#x27;s app rather than the co-operation with Tecent, the Chinese second largest online corporation, although it invested in JD.com in March 2014. As an ecommerce business, JD.com has been constantly facing challenges and opportunities of reintermediation with the rapid shifts of the technology development of the Internet.

===Email===
Email marketing is directly marketing a commercial message to a group of people using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database. Broadly, the term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.

===In-product communication===
Another channel for direct digital marketing is in-product communication (or in-product marketing), which delivers marketing content directly to a user&#x27;s internet-connected device or software application. In-product marketing content is often very similar to that of email marketing campaigns, but the segmentation and delivery is more targeted. Because email has become a standard tool in the digital marketing toolkit, the email channel often is overloaded and overused, leading to much lower open rates, lower engagement rates, lower click-through rates (CTR), and lower conversion rates. The rise of internet-connected (IOT) devices is enabling a growing number of consumer products manufacturers to take advantage of this channel of marketing communications, to supplement other digital marketing channels.

==Guerrilla marketing==
Due to the rise in advertising clutter, there has been a push for non-traditional media such as guerrilla marketing. Guerrilla marketing is usually a low-cost way of generating buzz through creative or unexpected communication platforms. Outdoor settings provide potential ground to gain attention from a large audience. An example is customizing street infrastructure or creating an event such as a flash mob. Research rates guerrilla advertising as having a higher perceived value compared to other communication platforms, which tends to result in a positive consumer response. An example of successful guerrilla marketing was created by Volkswagen (VW) in their promotional &quot;driven by fun&quot; campaign, where consumers could use VW &quot;fast lane&quot; slide instead of the escalator to get to the bottom of the stairs faster.

==Touch points==
Every point of contact is a form of communication and it is, therefore, necessary to consider touch points as a communication platform. Touch points can be either physical or a human interaction between a brand and the consumer which influence customer decision-making process during pre-purchase, purchase and post-purchase.

There are many ways in which a customer may interact with a business. Interactions occur through direct customer service exchanges, a company website, the point of purchase environment and product packaging or performance. These all contribute to consumer perceptions of a particular brand. For instance, the service-scape of a purchase touch point such as a retail store can influence the perception of quality and service through lighting and layout or other sensory touch points, for example, smell. Fast fashion retailers such as Topshop maintain a white store interior and exterior which is perceived as luxurious. Likewise, the higher price point and packaging of Ferrero Rocher may communicate sophistication and better quality. Visual appearance can have a significant effect on purchase decision, companies such as Coke a Cola and Pepsi provide a free fridge to distributors to control how products are displayed at the point of purchase.

==Multiplier effect==
While boarding a United Airlines flight, Dave Carroll saw baggage handlers on the tarmac damage his Taylor guitar. After failed attempts to solve the issue through customer service, Carroll uploaded a humorous YouTube video titled &quot;United breaks guitars&quot;, which experienced over 15 million views. Carroll&#x27;s YouTube video is an example of the multiplier effect, and how consumer experiences are shared through user-generated content (UGC) networks and word of mouth communication. Research shows customers are more likely to pass on negative experiences, and therefore, such interactive platforms have a significant impact on purchase decisions and brand outlook.

This highlights a trend in integration of consumer behavior with marketing communications, where technology has facilitated social group communication. Communication has changed from one direction with companies in control of their message to a dialogue where businesses interact with consumer feedback. As Andy Lark, Commonwealth Bank CMO states &quot;the power has shifted, we are now entering a transparent age where there are no secrets&quot;.

Traditional models viewed paid media platforms as the primary source of information. However, technology has enabled dialogue within a consumer-centric communication platform. This flow of information allows a many-to-many exchange through UGC, which includes all types of creative content online through blogs, chats, forums, online platforms for product reviews and social media websites such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, which are known as earned and shared media.

=== Co-creation ===
Co-creation takes place when customers not only buy the company&#x27;s products but also help in designing and developing them. Nike built an example of co-creation and customer empowerment through earned and shared media. Nike ID is an online application that allows customers to design their shoe and therefore &quot;Just do it online&quot;. Market-generated media remain an important communication platform and information source. Consumers tend to consider both market-generated and UGC when making a purchase decision, particularly, for higher involvement product like vinyl record albums. The transition from traditional media to various forms of online and UGC marketing is increasing. Academics recognize that marketing communication is an open system and customers are influenced by multiple communication platforms. Ultimately positive brand encounters manifest brand supporters who contribute to positive earned and shared media, through product recommendations online and offline.

===Direct marketing===
In direct marketing the producer communicates directly with potential customers, instead of through third-party media. Individual customer&#x27;s responses and transactions are recorded. Direct marketing is a growing form of marketing communication. It is designed to build the relationship between the customer and the brand, known as customer relationship management (CRM). Organizations use customer accounts in order to monitor and understand their needs. They manage detailed information about the customer&#x27;s touch points with the objective to maximize satisfaction and loyalty. The communication can be in person, by telephone, mail, email or website. The interaction between the organization and the customer is usually a two-way communication. Direct marketing relies on CRM databases that contain valuable customer information. Good quality databases can provide a competitive advantage and increase profitability. Treating the customer database as an expense rather than an investment, or not continuously maintaining or updating them can be detrimental.

===Direct mail===
Direct mail is a letter, card, catalog, or sample sent through post, email, fax, or courier. This communication is most effective when the recipient has shown interest in or has previously purchased from the organization. Advantages of direct mail are personalization, careful targeting, creativity and flexibility. Email is low-cost, but can be lost through spam and junk email filters. Direct mail is dependent on accurate databases.

===Telemarketing===
Telemarketing is marketing communication via telephone. There are two types of telemarketing: outbound and inbound. Outbound telemarketing is used by organizations to reach out to potential customers, generate sales, make appointments with salespeople and introduce new products. Inbound telemarketing is where people call the organization to complain or inquire about products. Both outbound and inbound can be used as a customer service strategy to boost sales and receive suggestions for improvement. Advantages of telemarketing include targeted communications, flexible and direct interaction between the organization and the customer, it can be an effective personal selling partner and it is cost-effective compared to face-to-face contact. A disadvantage is that call centers are usually used to handle outbound and inbound telemarketing, which need to be implemented, managed and financed.

===Mail order===
Mail order marketing is a catalog of products that customers can order to receive in the mail. This form of direct marketing dates back over 100 years. Home shopping, online shopping and teleshopping now accompany it. With current technology mail order has improved. Now there can be a larger range in catalog, delivery is faster, and complaints are dealt with professionally. Mail order exerts less pressure on the customer than telemarketing and sales are easy to manage, however costly infrastructure is required in maintaining the back-end.

===Direct-response advertising===
Direct-response advertising is partially direct marketing. It is a message transmitted through traditional communications media that requires the reader, viewer, listener or customer to respond directly to the organization. The audience may respond to receive more information or to purchase a product. A common example of direct response advertising is in television &quot;home shopping immediately to receive a particular deal or discount. Disadvantages are that focus can be lost because of the medium of communication and the targeting can be less narrow compared to direct mail. Organizational messages can get cluttered and crowded.

====Cellular marketing====
Cellular marketing uses the audience&#x27;s mobile phone and SMS to promote a product or brand. Advantages are a high level of flexibility and easy integration through computer systems using the Internet to send mass text messages. This marketing communications platform allows organizations to directly target customers to remind them to renew subscriptions, give exclusive product discounts, or build brand reputation through competitions or sweepstakes. 
The disadvantage is that some customers are charged to receive SMS, so opt-in permission is required.

====CD/DVD technology====
CD and DVD discs can be used as part of e-communications. Entire marketing presentations, catalogs, brochures and price lists can be stored on a CD. CDs are small and simple to hand out to target audiences and most modern computers have CD drive readers, however, most of the same information can be presented on a website or email.

==Integrated marketing communications==
Integrated marketing communications (IMC) is the use of marketing strategies to optimize the communication of a consistent message of the company&#x27;s brands to stakeholders. Coupling methods together improves communication as it harnesses the benefits of each channel, which when combined, builds a clearer and vaster impact than if used individually. IMC requires marketers to identify the boundaries around the promotional mix elements and to consider the effectiveness of the campaign&#x27;s message.

In the mid to late 1980s, the marketing environment was undergoing profound environmental changes with implications for marketing communications. Media proliferation, audience fragmentation, globalization of markets, the advent of new communications technologies, the widespread use of databases meant that the old methods, and practices used in mass marketing were no longer relevant. In particular, the rise of digital and interactive media meant that marketers were relying less on advertising as the dominant form of marketing communications. Amongst practitioners and scholars, there was an increasing recognition that new approaches to marketing communications were required. That new approach would become known as &quot;integrated marketing communications.&quot; A number of empirical studies, carried out in the early 1990s, found that the new IMC was far from a &quot;short-lived managerial fad,&quot; but rather was a very clear reaction by advertisers and marketers to the changing external environment.

Integrated marketing communications is a holistic planning process that focuses on integrating messages across communications disciplines, creative executions, media, timing and stakeholders. An integrated approach has emerged as the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs and has been described as a &quot;paradigm shift.&quot;

IMC unifies and coordinates an organization&#x27;s marketing communications to promote a consistent brand message. Coordinating a brand&#x27;s communications makes the brand seem more trustworthy and sound, as it is seen as a &#x27;whole&#x27; rather than a mixture of different messages being sent out. The IMC perspective looks at the &#x27;big picture&#x27; in marketing, advertising and promotions.

===History===
The impetus to rethink marketing communications came from a number of environmental changes that were becoming increasingly apparent throughout the mid to late 1980s. Media was proliferating and at the same time converging, audiences were fragmenting and many new communications disciplines were emerging. Few advertising agencies provided the full suite of services in terms of the varied communications disciplines. Companies were reliant on a multiplicity of service providers for assistance with advertising, public-relations, branding, packaging, sales promotion, event organizers and other promotional activities. Each of these communications disciplines was treated as a &quot;silo&quot;; with little thought to the synergies between them, with the result that many different stakeholders involved in presenting the company&#x27;s external image throughout the breadth and length of a campaign. In that environment, both practitioners and theorists recognized the potential for confusing or inconsistent brand images to develop across media and across different communications disciplines. The fragmentation of audiences presented marketers with particular challenges. No longer were they able to communicate with mass markets via mass media; instead they needed to communicate with increasingly tightly defined market segments, using highly specialist media and communications disciplines. New media and the use of databases were enabling marketers to communicate with customers on a one-to-one basis. The old methods and practices associated with mass communications were failing to serve the realities of the new era. The imperative to present a clear, coherent and unified narrative in both internal and external communications was becoming increasingly apparent by the late 1980s.

In 1989, two discrete events served to draw attention to the fact that industry attitudes to marketing communications were shifting. Firstly, the consulting firm, Shearson-Lehman Hutton published a report on the subject of consumer advertising, signaling that a number of market-place changes would force packaged goods marketers to adopt a more integrated approach to marketing communications. Their report also noted that high-end manufacturers (e.g. automobiles) and up-market services (e.g. cruise vacations) were more inclined to use integrated promotions. Secondly, the American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A&#x27;s), instituted a task-force to investigate integrated marketing communications (IMC), with the result that the first official definition was published. The AAAA defined IMC as, &quot;a concept of marketing communications planning that recognizes the added value of a comprehensive plan that evaluates the strategic roles of a variety of communication disciplines (e.g. general advertising, direct response, sales promotion, and public relations) and combines these disciplines to provide clarity, consistency, and maximum communication impact.&quot; At this stage, the development of IMC, focused primarily on the need for organizations to offer more than just standard advertising and to integrate the various communications disciplines. The 4As originally coined the term the &quot;new advertising&quot;; however, this title did not appropriately incorporate many other aspects included in the term &quot;IMC&quot; – most notably, those beyond traditional advertising process aside from simply advertising.
In 1991, the faculty of Medill School of Journalism, Northwestern University in conjunction with the AAAA, began the first empirical research study designed to investigate how IMC was being used. The study focused around understanding the concept and the importance of IMC and also to analyze the extent in which IMC was practiced in all major U.S advertising agencies. This initial study was then replicated by other studies with a view to examining how IMC was being used in other countries; New Zealand, UK, US, Australia, India, Thailand, South Africa and the Philippines, etc. The findings from these studies demonstrated that the new IMC was far from a &quot;short-lived managerial fad&quot; but rather was &quot;a very clear reaction by advertising agencies and their clients as they are affected by a multitude of factors such as new forms of information technology including development and usage of databases, media fragmentation, client desires for interaction/synergy, and global and regional coordination.&quot; This was the second stage of IMC&#x27;s development, where the focus shifted to documenting the practice of IMC as a global phenomenon. In other words, researchers were attempting to codify practices that had been used for some time.

In 1993, Don Schultz and his team published the first text-book dedicated to IMC. Their work, simply entitled, &quot;Integrated Marketing Communications,&quot; described IMC as a totally new way of looking at the whole of marketing communications, rather than looking at each of the parts separately. And, in the same year, the Medill School at Northwestern University changed their curriculum to include a focus on this new idea of integrated marketing communications rather than the traditional program which had emphasized advertising. IMC emerged from an &quot;academic department that, for several decades, had been recognized as the number one advertising program. Since the mid-1990s, virtually every text-book on the subject of marketing communications has adopted an integrated perspective or has added chapters on IMC in new editions of standard works. Collectively these books focus on the IMC planning processes and this represents the third distinct stage in the evolution of IMC – an emphasis on managing and organizing IMC.

Over time, scholars have advanced different definitions of IMC, with each definition exhibiting a slightly different emphasis. Yet, in spite of the variety of definitions in circulation, there is general consensus that integrated marketing communications should be viewed as a planning process. Some scholars have pointed out that because IMC is both a process and a concept, it is exceedingly difficult to define.

Some of the key definitions that have been advanced during IMC&#x27;s evolution are outlined here:

* &quot;IMC is the process of all sources and information managed so a consumer or prospect is exposed which behaviorally moves the customer more towards a sale.&quot;
* &quot;The strategic coordination of all messages and media used by an organization to influence its perceived brand value.&quot;
* &quot;The process of strategically controlling or influencing all messages and encoring purposeful dialogue to created and nourish profitable relationships with consumers and other stakeholders.&quot;
* &quot;[A three-pronged definition] One-voice marketing communications is integration that creates a clear and consistent image, position, message, and/or theme across all marketing communication disciplines or tools. Integrated communications refers to the creation of both a brand image and a behavioral response that emanate directly from marketing communications materials such as advertisements. Coordinated marketing communications associates &#x27;integrated&#x27; with the concept of &#x27;coordination&#x27;.
* &quot;IMC is a strategic business process used to plan, develop, execute and evaluate coordinate measurable persuasive brand communication programs over time with consumers, customers and prospects, and other that are targeted, relevant internal and external audiences.&quot;
* &quot;IMC is the concept and process of strategically managing audience-focused, channel-centered, and results-driven brand communication programs over time.&quot;
* &quot;An IMC program plans and executes various marketing activities with consistency so that its total impact exceeds the sum of each activity. It is a strategy in which different communication tools like advertising, public relations, sales promotion, direct marketing and personal selling work together to maximize the communication impact on target consumers.&quot; (Saeed et al., 2013)
* &quot;IMC is the planning and execution of all types of advertising-like and promotion-like messages selected for a brand, service, or company, in order to meet a common set of communication objectives, or more particularly, to support a single ‘ positioning’.&quot;

Today, there is general agreement amongst both practitioners and scholars that the emergence of IMC represents &quot;a significant example of development in the marketing discipline... [that] has influenced thinking and acting among all types of companies and organizations facing the realities of competition in an open economy.&quot; Belch and Belch argue that IMC has become the dominant approach used by companies to plan and execute their marketing communication programs while other scholars have described IMC as a &quot;paradigm shift.&quot; Larry Percy argues that &quot;the planning and execution of &quot;all&quot; marketing communication should be &quot;integrated&quot;&quot;.

===Meaning of integration===
Within the literature there is no absolute agreement about the meaning of &quot;integration&quot; in the concept, &quot;integrated marketing communications&quot;. The concept of IMC has evolved during its brief history, and with that different ideas around the meaning of integration have been advanced. The diverse views surrounding IMC and its meaning can be explained by the early state of theoretical development and research on IMC which gives rise to a multiplicity of different perspectives. As the discipline matures, these different views are expected to converge.

The marketing and advertising literature identifies many different types of integration:

====Functional integration====
Functional integration refers to the capacity of the different promotional tools to complement each other and deliver a unified, coherent message. Each of the communications disciplines (advertising, PR, personal selling, sales promotion etc.) has its own strengths and weaknesses. For instance, it is generally recognised that straight advertising is very effective at creating brand awareness, but much less effective at converting awareness into actual sales. As consumers approach the actual purchase, they may turn to other types of promotion such as personal selling or direct marketing. A carefully planned communications program will include a blend of tools in a way that the messages move the customer through the various stages of the purchase decision – from need recognition through to purchase and post-purchase stages. Integrating the communications disciplines addresses the question of how the strengths of one discipline can be used to overcome the weaknesses of a different discipline.

====Message integration====
Message integration is also known as &quot;image integration&quot; or &quot;creative integration&quot;. A key task for IMC is ensuring consistency in executions within and across the different types of marketing communications, as well as over time. Everything connected with an IMC campaign should have a similar &#x27;look and feel&#x27;, irrespective of the medium or tool. Message integration does not imply that messages need to be identical. Rather it means that every piece of promotion – from advertising to direct mail to collateral materials to packaging to posters to corporate vehicles to business cards and office stationery – should be immediately recognizable as part of the same livery.

Clearly, media releases which are often part of a PR program are very different to persuasive messages used in advertising. However, messages should include a similar tone and at least some common elements so that each message looks like it is part of a coherent, integrated campaign. Every execution is part of the brand&#x27;s identity. Consistent executions facilitate brand awareness. People associate the &#x27;look&#x27; of the brand&#x27;s marketing communication with the brand itself. Consistent executions are more of a &#x27;feeling&#x27; that ties everything together; a unique look or feel so that the target audience recognizes a brand&#x27;s marketing communication even before they see the brand name. The key to consistency is the visual feel. This is because the visual memory for the imagery associated with the brand actually elicits faster brand identification than the brand name itself.

====Media integration====
Much IMC planning is concerned with coordinating different media channels to optimize the effectiveness of marketing communications programs. If brand communications &quot;reflect implied brand values and imagery that are consistent throughout differing media channels, then clearly these channels act in a mutually reinforcing way with each successive consumer engagement.&quot; Certain messages may not translate into other media. For instance, messages containing &#x27;sex appeals&#x27; may work well on TV because movement lends itself to eroticism, but may become &quot;flat&quot; in a static medium such as print. In such cases it is important that the secondary media support the primary media and that messages harmonize.

Research studies suggest that consumers learn more quickly when exposed to messages via different media. The explanation for this is that slight variations in execution create a slight mental perturbation which grabs attention, and results in more elaborate encoding of the main message argument. By exposing consumers to the same message through multiple media, there are more opportunities to engage with consumers. In short, a multimedia strategy is more effective.

====Integration of timing====
Integration of timing refers to the timing messages so that they operate to support each other and reach potential customers at different junctures, depending on when they are most receptive to different types of message or depending on the consumer&#x27;s readiness to buy.

====Other types of integration====
Other types of integration include:
:Coordinated integration refers to the ways that different internal and external agencies (e.g. web designers, advertising agencies, PR consultants, graphic designers) coordinate to provide a consistent message.
:Stakeholder integration refers to the way that all stakeholders (e.g. employees, suppliers, customers and others) cooperate to communicate a shared understanding of the company&#x27;s key messages and values. 
:Relationship integration refers to the way that communications professionals (e.g. marketing managers, advertising managers) contribute to the company&#x27;s overall corporate goals and quality management.

===Criticisms===
Both practitioners and scholars agree that IMC makes practical &quot;good sense&quot;. Consequently, the discipline has relatively few critics. Nevertheless, researchers have pointed to areas that are in need of further research, and highlight some of the discipline&#x27;s deficiencies:

*Some practitioners and scholars argue that IMC is not new. Skeptics point out that the more experienced communications managers, especially national brand managers, have always practiced integration.
*A more serious criticism of IMC concerns the problem of measurement. The value of IMC activities has proved very difficult to measure due to the interactions of different communications tools. A growing number of scholars agree that the lack of rigorous measurement metrics and methods represents a major challenge for the discipline.
*Studies have shown that, while managers are familiar with the IMC concept in theory, it is not widely practiced. Such findings suggest that IMC is easy to understand, but difficult to do. One possible explanation for the slow uptake is that organizational barriers to implementation may have become entrenched and are difficult to overcome. A number of organizational characteristics have been cited as possible barriers to implementation. These factors include: a mind-set that has been built up over the years which promotes specialization rather than integration; organizational structure which has been designed to manage specialisms (e.g. advertising, PR as separate branches); manager ability and lack of skills in integration; agency remuneration systems and the adequacy of budgets.

===Marketing communications framework===
The marketing communications planning framework (MCPF) is a model for the creation of an ICM plan. Created by Chris Fill, senior examiner for the Chartered Institute of Marketing, the MCPF is intended to solve the inadequacies of other frameworks.

=== Integrated marketing communications planning approaches ===
====Inside–out approach====
An “inside-out” approach is the traditional planning approach to marketing communication. Planning begins &quot;inside&quot; the organization by identifying the goals and objectives which are often based around what has always been done. Communication&#x27;s task then becomes a process of &quot;selling&quot; the organization&#x27;s message to the &quot;outside&quot; or external stakeholders.

The inside–out approach to integrated marketing communications has been criticized as a one sided view point, since it combines the elements of communication and marketing to create a single unified message. Porcu and his team point out that many of the first, tentative attempts to practice IMC were primarily concerned with integrating the message, so that the organization appeared to speak with &quot;one voice,&quot; but failed to adopt a more rounded customer orientation. The inside–out approach is weak due to the stagnant, outdated method.

====Outside–in approach====
The outside–in approach of integrated marketing communications seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer. In addition to the previous category, this approach establishes significant progression. Organizations can gain in-depth knowledge based on consumers and therefore can accommodate the way they approach to fulfill their requirements. Relationship marketing aids in building up a history of frequent conversation between organizations and stakeholders which contributes to trust. Communication builds rapport that could prove to be profitable as they retain clientele. The outside-in approach offers a unique way to plan, as it operates backwards by concentrating on customers first, then determining the most effective course of marketing and communication methods to implement. Effectively managing the strategic business process is crucial as it defines the steps to follow which ensure brand value is upheld.

====Cross-functional planning approach====
Cross-functional planning approach of integrated marketing communications diverges away from the other two categories, it does not center around the concept of marketing promotional elements, instead the focus has shifted toward restructuring the organization to increase a customer-centric environment. This approach recognizes that messages do not just come from the marketing department, but can come from virtually any department within the organization. Investing for the reorganization sparks change where all departments interconnect to work cohesively toward managing and planning all stages of brand relationship. As a unified organization, the cross-functional process is a competitive advantage as they can achieve profitable relationships with customers and stakeholders. This can be achieved through improving the relation amongst messages sent from all departments through channels to the receivers. By sending strategic messages and monitoring any external reaction, organizations gain feedback data from consumers which can be used to inform subsequent planning or fine-tuning of the communications strategy. The process is circular, not linear, at the beginning organization and consumer communicate by interacting and dialogue which ignites the relationship, over time trust is earned and the consumer may continue to purchase, which in turn increases sales and profitability for the organization and finally, the relationship is strong and the organization retains clientele. Interactive communication is advantageous for a cross-functional approach as the business and consumer are both involved in brand communication. Implementing IMC is a flexible process due to the changing nature of the marketing dynamics therefore by eliminating borders within the organization it allows for this notion.

===Barriers to implementation===
The barriers to implementation have been cited as one of the main reasons for the failure to adopt holistic approaches to IMC. The key barriers cited in the literature are:

No support from senior management

It is vital for an organization who implements integrated marketing communications to have the commitment from all levels of employees, including senior management. The union between both marketing and corporate goals should coincide and support simultaneously. The lack of involvement from senior management could lead to IMC being deprived of resources which prevent the full potential IMC can deliver for the organization to benefit from. Higher levels of the business need to coincide with the efforts of staff in the strategic planning to grasp that IMC&#x27;s program is valuable.

Clients are confused about the concept

Some companies such as advertising agencies could possibly take advantage of the integrated marketing communications model, due to the stress they receive from clients and budgets being reduced. The introduction of new technology broadens the boundaries for advertising elements to endeavor with such avenues like the internet. Their focus may stray from the core principles of IMC which is to integrate the elements together, as they&#x27;re less effective individually. Also, their clients may not grasp the IMC concept as an essential attribute, therefore, they perceive IMC as saving money due to the strategic juxtaposition.

Organization is too specialized 

One of the core fundamentals of integrated marketing communications is that the focus aspires toward a customer orientation. In spite of that, the purpose of some organizations have not adopted the framework and are still task orientated. Examples include public relations, direct marketing and advertising.

Conflict within organization 

Trying to implement integrated marketing communications into strong hierarchy structured organizations may cause staff resistance due to the nature of horizontal communication causing disagreements amongst staff. Staff may not perform their tasks and functions which jeopardizes the work environment. For IMC to be successful the culture of the organization needs to accommodate an open perspective where communication amongst the varying departments are managed tactically. Individuals reactions toward the new restructure will differ, as some become custom to the process and enjoy the borderless integration, on the other hand, some may feel threatened from the absence of control that once maintained order and power within the previous structured organization (Vladmir, Miroslav, &amp; Papic, 2012). A corporate structure may not necessarily invite IMC due to their culture being incompatible for the integration.

====Removing barriers====
Integrated marketing communication is the process of communicating an idea in order to attract customers using an array of tools. It is the process of sending out a message to a receiver (Communications, 2016). Depending on the company values and the type of product or service they offer, the most appropriate message to deliver will depend on the brand and consumer. To understand how integrated marketing communication can benefit a business, three main areas will be discussed. These areas being who the Sender is? Who is the Receiver? And what tools can the sender use in order to pass a message on to the receiver?

Practical solutions towards improving marketing strategies by using ICM can be done through two differing marketing concepts: the four P&#x27;s or the four C&#x27;s. Also, the uses of encoding and decoding should be followed, all of which intertwine to form growth in sales financially for a business.

A sender is someone who is aiming to communicate an idea to a receiver, which might be an individual or a group. Marketers must first understand who they receive in order to successfully implement marketing communications. For example, Staples seeks to identify itself as a &#x27;one-stop&#x27; shop for all office needs. It advertises a wide variety of office supplies, safe and on-time delivery, competitive pricing and excellent customer service. Staples focuses its marketing efforts on advertising those values. Their slogan &quot;To make more happen, every day&quot;. This theme is the most appropriate because it attracts its target audience. Workers have little time on their hands, the product they offer will give them the ability to make life easier; by doing so, they save time. In today&#x27;s fast-paced lifestyle, if a service is convenient, customers will most likely use the product. Staples have successfully taken the necessary steps in order to communicate their values to their customers. They have done this by understanding who they are and who they should be targeting.

==4C&#x27;s==
Originally, marketing was focused around the 4P&#x27;s (product, price, place and promotion) which concentrated on companies&#x27; internal concepts. The idea of integrated marketing communications was first raised in 1993 by Don E. Schultz, who changed the 4P&#x27;s concept into the 4C&#x27;s model. The four parts include consumer, communication, convenience and cost, taking into consideration the needs and wants of consumers. Integrated marketing communications accomplished synergy when each element was executed in accordance with the overall vision of the organization&#x27;s campaign, which allows the message to be executed efficiently. Finding out who the target market is to answer the 4C&#x27;s: knowing what products they&#x27;re willing to purchase, the amount of money they are willing to spend for it, how the product will fulfil their needs and wants, the accessibility of the product and how easily correct information is transmitted. Changing the emphasis on what consumers desire leads to a higher success being attained through IMC, as it is being influenced by not only internal stakeholders but also external ones.

==Communication-based relationship marketing==
Expanding from this, Tom Duncan and Sandra E. Moriarty formed the concept of communication-based relationship marketing. This model diverged from the concept of the general one way, business influencing consumers what to believe scenario. However, Duncan and Moriarty argued that communication between business and consumers was the key to developing a strong establishment for consumer oriented marketing endeavors. The process of IMC through communication-based marketing goes through a sequential three stage process. Organizations begin with choosing an effective mixture of communication methods; then, the marketing methods are selected; thereafter, the best of each element is fused and integrated together which thence is channeled from the organization to the audience. Subsequently, these findings shaped modern marketing, focusing on an interactive two-way approach that builds rapport with stakeholders. Developments from integrated marketing communications have evolved into three categories: inside-out approach, outside-in approach and cross-functional strategic approach.

==Branding==

Branding goes beyond having a logo; it is how businesses communicate on behalf of their company, verbally and visually. A brand is a conversation it is how people talk about your company when you are not in the room. Consumers are constantly interacting and meeting with brands. This can be through television or other media advertisements such as event sponsorships, personal selling and product packaging. Brand exposure such as this is known as a brand touch point or brand contact whereby the organization can try impressing its consumer. Without branding, consumers wouldn&#x27;t be able to decipher between products and decide which one they like most. People may not be able to even tell the differences between some of the brands, they would have to try each brand several times before being able to judge which one was best. In order to help with purchase decisions, marketing communications try to create a distinct image for the brand. Brand associations are made to encourage linkages with places, personalities or even emotions which creates a sophisticated brand personality in the minds of the consumers. This shows how brand communications add value to products and why branding is a crucial aspect to the communication platform.

=== Consumer–brand relationship constructs ===
To build brand loyalty is to build a trusting relationship with a brand so strong that you will repeatedly buy from them due to an emotional commitment to the brand. There are many CBR constructs but five of the main ones in the literature are brand love, brand attachment, self-brand connection, brand identification, and brand trust. All five of these constructs are not exclusive and firm, but can overlap each other. Brand attachment is the emotional connection a customer has with a brand. Brand love is the measurement of that emotional commitment to a specific brand from a satisfied customer. Self-brand connection is the degree to which a brand has become an important aspect of one&#x27;s self-identity. In other words, this brand accurately represents their self-concept. Over the years, researchers argue that self-brand connection is the most important of all the CBR constructs. Brand identification is the consumer&#x27;s perceived unity and oneness with the brand. Lastly, brand trust is the consumers perceived feelings of safety and assurance in the brand&#x27;s products and company.

==Focus==
Marketing communications are focused on the product/service as opposed to corporate communications where the focus of communications work is the company/enterprise itself. Marketing communications are primarily concerned with demand generation and product/service positioning while corporate communications deal with issue management, mergers and acquisitions, litigation, etc.

==Customer-focused versus customer-centric==
A recent revelation in integrated marketing communication is the change in the role of the customer within the business world. Due to the fast-paced growth of technology, customers are rapidly gaining more power through forums such as word of mouth; now with capabilities of reaching a much wider audience through the use of social media. Recognizing this power shift, organizations have begun to re-evaluate their typical marketing strategies and customer approaches from the traditional customer-focused attitude to the wide-spreading customer-centric method in order to develop a more integrated strategy.

A customer-focused approach can be defined as &quot;when an organization learns more about the habits of the customer so that they can identify opportunities for cross-selling&quot;. While this type of approach can be viewed as entirely satisfactory, Kliatchko (2008) introduced a contrasting concept which concentrates on &quot;working from the outside in&quot; and promotes a different perspective on organizations. When an organization adopts a customer-centric technique, they forgo the view that customers are only passive receivers of marketing techniques and focus on listening to what their needs are and striving to satisfy them; integrating the customer into the process. Many organizations are yet to relinquish such control, as shown by research conducted by &quot;Campaign&quot; magazine, which can only be suspected to be due to the fear that it could potentially diminish the marketing profession.

<doc id="945462" wikidata="Q1903625" url="?curid=945462" title="Martin Dies Jr.">
<text>Martin Dies Jr. (November 5, 1900 – November 14, 1972), also known as Martin Dies Sr., was a Texas politician and a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives. He was elected as a Democrat to the Seventy-second and after that to the six succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1931 – January 3, 1945). In 1944, Dies did not seek renomination to the Seventy-ninth Congress, but was elected to the Eighty-third and to the two succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1953 – January 3, 1959). Again, he did not seek renomination in 1958 to the Eighty-sixth Congress. In 1941 and 1957, he was twice defeated for the nomination to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate. Dies served as the first chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities from 1937 through 1944 (Seventy-fifth through Seventy-eighth Congresses).

==Background==
He was born in Colorado City, Texas, on November 5, 1900, to Martin Dies Sr., who was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1909 to 1919. He studied at the University of Texas and obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree at the National University School of Law, Washington, DC.

==Career==
Dies worked as an attorney in Marshall, Texas and Orange, Texas and eventually became a district judge. In 1931, Dies was elected from Texas 2nd District to the House of Representatives, a constituency that his father represented for a decade, thus becoming a second generation Democratic U.S. congressman.

After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Dies wrote in the Chicago &quot;Herald-Examiner&quot; that the &quot;large alien population is the basic cause of unemployment.&quot;

Due to the support of fellow Texan John Nance Garner, he became a member of the important House Rules Committee. At the beginning, Dies fully supported the New Deal as it aimed to provide relief for the distressed rural areas, which he represented in Congress. However, being a conservative Southerner, he turned against it after the 1936 election, when labor unions started to play a much bigger role in national politics.

In 1938, he started as a chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities and remained at its helm until 1944. At ease with newsmen, Dies was frequently in the national media spotlight.

===House Committee Investigating Un-American Activities===

Dies and Samuel Dickstein created the House Committee Investigating Un-American Activities, initially nicknamed the Dies Committee, later becoming HUAC in 1946. Dies was its first chairman, serving for seven years from 1938 to 1944, and declaring a crusade against right-wing and left-wing subversives in the government, and other organizations nationwide. Dies&#x27; committee mainly targeted communist infiltrators and sympathizers. Samuel Dickstein was named in the 1990s as a Soviet agent in the Venona project materials.

====Dies Committee and the KKK====

In pre-war years and during World War II, HUAC was known as the Dies Committee. Its work was aimed at investigating fascist and communist subversive activities. Dies targeted German American involvement in Nazi and Ku Klux Klan activity, such as the German American Bund. As to investigations into the activities of the Klan, some members of the Committee showed reluctance to investigate. When HUAC&#x27;s chief counsel Ernest Adamson announced that: &quot;The committee has decided that it lacks sufficient data on which to base a probe,&quot; committee member John E. Rankin added: &quot;After all, the KKK is an old American institution.&quot; However, Dies himself personally berated Imperial Wizard James A. Colescott for the Klan&#x27;s anti-Catholicism.

As chairman, Dies pursued Nazis, labor unions, New Deal agencies, and communist or communist-affiliated groups, from which he gained a national reputation and even published a book about his exploits, &quot;The Trojan Horse of America&quot; (1940).

====Shirley Temple and Hollywood====

While there had been earlier Congressional hearings on communist and Nazi activity, such as by Hamilton Fish in 1932 and McCormack and Dickstein in 1934, the Dies Committee hearings captured greater public attention and scrutiny. In 1938, the committee was criticized for including Shirley Temple, who was 10 years old at the time, on a list of Hollywood figures who sent greetings to the leftist Communist-owned French newspaper, &quot;Ce Soir&quot;. The Roosevelt Administration mentioned the attacks when Harold Ickes, Secretary of the Interior, stated: &quot;They have found dangerous radicals there led by little Shirley Temple.&quot; Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins added that Shirley Temple was born an American citizen and should not have to debate such &quot;preposterous revelations&quot;. The Committee responded to these attacks via an NBC broadcast, in which the testimony of Dr. J. B. Matthews, which launched the Shirley Temple outcry was read . In this testimony, Dr. Matthews stated: The Communist Party relies heavily on the carelessness or indifference of thousands of prominent citizens in lending their names for its propaganda purposes. For example, the French newspaper &quot;Ce Soir&quot;, which is owned outright by the Communist Party, featured hearty greetings from Clark Gable, Robert Taylor, James Cagney, and even Shirley Temple. ... No one, I hope, is going to claim that any one of these persons in particular is a Communist. 

====Backlash====

Dies was criticized for using his Committee to further his personal campaign to undermine the New Deal agenda during the late 1930s and early 1940s. For example, Michigan Governor Frank Murphy lost his re-election bid in 1938 after being labeled &quot;a Communist or a Communist dupe&quot; during testimony before the committee. Roosevelt himself labeled this incident as a &quot;flagrantly unfair and un-American attempt to influence an election.&quot; The Labor Department, the WPA Federal Theatre Project and Writers&#x27; Project, and the National Labor Relations Board were subjected to similar denunciations. While the Committee ostensibly investigated both suspected Communists and Fascists, Dies was concerned primarily with a supposed Communist conspiracy, as reflected in his own book, &quot;The Trojan Horse in America&quot;. In 1940, Congressman Frank Eugene Hook sought to discredit the committee, and Dies personally, by presenting evidence linking Dies to the agitator and spiritualist William Dudley Pelley; but Dies was able to show that the documents cited by Hook were forged.

Dies articulated concerns of the &quot;racial question&quot; as it related to minimum wage provision under the Fair Labor Standards Acts, stating, &quot;What is prescribed for one race must be prescribed for the others, and you cannot prescribe the same wages for the black man as for the white man.&quot;

Encouraged by his victory over Hook and a quadrupling of his Committee&#x27;s budget, Dies&#x27; accusations became progressively more scurrilous. In March 1942, he wrote a letter to Vice President Henry Wallace claiming that 35 members of the Board of Economic Warfare, which Wallace chaired, had been members of Communist organizations. He singled out one member in particular, Maurice Parmelee, as both a Communist sympathizer and a nudist, based on Parmelee&#x27;s 1926 book, &quot;The New Gymnosophy&quot;. Parmelee was indeed an advocate for gymnosophy, a form of asceticism originated by two German nudist activists, but its relevance to American national security was never convincingly explained.

Dies&#x27; public charges and rumor-mongering after June 1941 came at a time when the USSR was a member of the allied nations resisting the Nazi offensive in Europe and North Africa. Rather than assisting the effort to ferret out Nazi spies during World War II, Dies continued his pre-war fixation and focused almost entirely on Communist spies in the U.S. government—a precursor to the McCarthy era during the 1950s.

===Later life===

Dies was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate in a special election held in late June, 1941 to fill the seat vacated by the death of Senator Morris Sheppard. Dies finished a distant fourth, losing to the sitting Governor, Pappy O&#x27;Daniel who narrowly beat Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson in Johnson&#x27;s first run for the Senate.

Dies was a critic of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, having found 280 salaried CIO organizers within its ranks funded by the Soviet-backed Communist Party of the USA. Dies retired from the House in 1944 (or 1945) after the CIO began a voter registration drive in his district and found a candidate to oppose him. Dies supported the anti-Roosevelt Texas Regulars in the 1944 presidential election.

Dies was reelected to the House in 1952 in an at-large seat when Texas received another seat through reapportionment. In 1957, he ran for the Senate again in a special election to finish the term of Price Daniel, who left the Senate to become governor of Texas. Dies finished with 30 percent of the vote, second to Ralph Yarborough, who led with 38 percent. Republican Thad Hutcheson, a Houston lawyer, finished third with 23 percent. No runoff was then required in Texas special elections, though Dies and Hutcheson collectively held 53 percent of the vote. Yarborough hence took the Senate seat, which he held until January 3, 1971. Dies was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Dies retired again from the House in January 1959. From 1953 to 1959, &quot;he held no important positions.&quot;

Dies returned to Texas to practice law.

==Death and legacy==
In 1920, Dies married Myrtle McAdams and had three sons: Robert, Jack, and Martin Jr., who became a Texas state senator and Secretary of State of Texas.

Dies died November 14, 1972, of an apparent heart attack at the age of 72.

<text>Idiotville is a ghost town in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States, near the mouth of Idiot Creek on the Wilson River, on the route of Oregon Route 6. Idiotville&#x27;s elevation is .

==Background==
It is in the Tillamook State Forest, along the Tillamook-Washington county line, approximately west northwest of Portland. Nothing remains at the site.

The nearby stream was named Idiot Creek after the community and was added to the official United States Board on Geographic Names list in 1977. About a up Idiot Creek was a logging camp called Ryan&#x27;s Camp, which was part of the salvage operations following the Tillamook Burn. Since the spot was so remote, it was said that only an idiot would work there, so the camp was popularly known as Idiotville. The name was eventually applied to the stream. Idiotville has been noted for its unusual name.

<doc id="945474" wikidata="Q1352680" url="?curid=945474" title="Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW100">
<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW100 aircraft engine family is a series of turboprops manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada dominates the turboprop market with 89% of the turboprop regional airliner installed base in 2016, leading GE Aviation and Allison Engine Company.

==Development==
The engine was first introduced as a technology demonstrator in 1977. The PW100 was first tested in March 1981, made its initial flight in February 1982 on a Vickers Viscount testbed aircraft, and then entered service in December 1984 on a Dash 8 regional aircraft for NorOntair.

The PW150 engine was introduced on 24 April 1995, when Bombardier selected the engine for the launch of its de Havilland Dash 8-400 regional turboprop. The PW150 was a higher-power version of the PW100 series, with the low-pressure compressor changed from a single-stage centrifugal compressor to a three-stage axial compressor, and the turbine modified to have improved cooling. The power rating was increased from in the PW127 to in the PW150, although the engine was thermodynamically capable of .

At the 2021 Dubai Air Show, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada introduced the PW127XT (extended-time-on-wing) series. The PW127XT, which is intended to replace the PW127M variant, reduces the number of engine overhauls within 10 years to two from three. The engine maintenance interval (time-on-wing) is increased from 14,000 hours to 20,000 hours and would use three percent less fuel than the PW127M. The engine series will premiere as the standard powerplant on all new ATR 42 and ATR 72 aircraft, with a launch order from Air Corsica using the PW127XT-M engine model. The PW127XT-N variant, which is designed for the ATR 72-600, has the same mechanical power rating as the PW127XT-M but has a higher thermodynamic power rating.

==Design==
Originally called the PT7, the PW100 uses a relatively unusual three-shaft engine configuration. In the PW100, a centrifugal low-pressure (LP) impeller (except for the PW150, which uses a 3-stage axial LP compressor), driven by a single-stage LP turbine, supercharges a contra-rotating centrifugal high-pressure (HP) impeller, driven by a single-stage HP turbine. Power is delivered to the offset propeller reduction gearbox through a third shaft, connected to a two-stage free (power) turbine. The gearbox has two stages, yielding a reduction ratio between 15.4 and 17.16. The first stage uses double helical gears, followed by a second stage with straight spur gears.

==Variants==

The last two digits of each variant model number represent the nominal power at takeoff, in hundreds of horsepower.


=== Other variants ===
; PW119
: , no longer in service.
; PW124
: , no longer in service.
; PW124A
: No longer in service.
; PW125
: No longer in service.
; PW125A
: No longer in service.
; PW127TS

; PW127XT-S
: Selected to power the Deutsche Aircraft D328eco in June 2022.
; PW130
: Unsuccessfully offered for the Saab 2000 and IPTN N-250 aircraft. Proposed for the unbuilt Fokker 50-400 aircraft.
; PW150 Twin Pack
: Proposed powerplant for the Airbus A400M. Two PW150-based engines would be used to drive a single propeller. The powerplant was eliminated from contention by Airbus in early June 1999, since it was short of providing the required to drive the eight-bladed propeller at the time, and its specific fuel consumption (SFC) was excessive.
; PW150B
: Proposed powerplant for the Shaanxi Y-8F-600. Abandoned in December 2008 when the United States government barred a U.S.-based subcontractor from exporting the engine control software for the PW150B.
; PW150C
: Proposed powerplant for the Xian MA700. Includes a third-stage power turbine, larger-diameter propellers, modified reduction gearbox, and optimized low-pressure compressor. Has higher thrust, higher speed, and extended range compared to the PW150A. Blocked from an export license by the Canadian government in 2020, because of the Chinese government&#x27;s retaliatory detention of Canadian citizens (the &quot;two Michaels&quot;) starting in 2018.
; ST18M
: Marine application for the PW100.
; ST40
: PW150 derivative adapted for the Bombardier JetTrain, which was proposed for use in high-speed train travel in North America.
; ST40M
: Marine application for the PW150A.

<text>Sega Smash Pack (Sega Archives from USA in Japan) is a series of video game compilations developed and published by Sega. It features mostly Sega Genesis games.

==Pack 1 (Windows) ==
The first pack titled &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot; (&quot;Sega Archives from USA Vol. 1&quot; in Japan) featured eight games.
==Pack 2 (Windows)==
The second pack titled &quot;Sega Puzzle Pack&quot; (&quot;Sega Archives from USA Vol. 2&quot; in Japan) featured three games.

* &quot;Columns III: Revenge of Columns&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot; (1993)
* &quot;Lose Your Marbles&quot; (1997)

==Pack 3 (Windows)==
The third pack titled &quot;Sega Smash Pack 2&quot; (&quot;Sega Archives from USA Vol. 3&quot; in Japan) featured eight games.
==Console (Dreamcast)==
The console version of &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot; was released for Dreamcast titled &quot;Sega Smash Pack Volume 1&quot; and featured the following twelve games:

Jeff Gerstmann from GameSpot gave the console version a 4.5/10. He criticised the console version for its patchy performance and poorly emulated music.

The Genesis emulator built inside the compilation gained popularity with homebrew groups, as Echelon released a kit that allowed users to add and load their own Genesis ROMs. Gary Lake, the programmer, had himself deliberately left a documentation of the built-in emulator, with the documentation seemingly intended at them due to the filename (ECHELON.TXT). Additionally, &quot;Sega Swirl&quot; and &quot;Virtua Cop 2&quot; were the only non-Genesis games in the compilation.

==Handheld (Game Boy Advance)==
The handheld version of &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot; was released for Game Boy Advance simply titled &quot;Sega Smash Pack&quot; and featured three games, two of which had been included in the first Smash Pack. While &quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Sonic Spinball&quot; were developed using the original source code, &quot;Golden Axe&quot; had to be recreated from scratch.

*&quot;Ecco the Dolphin&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Golden Axe&quot; (1989) 
*&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball&quot; (1993)

Craig Harris from IGN gave the handheld version a 6/10. He criticised the handheld version for several technical issues and lack of cooperative multiplayer in &quot;Golden Axe&quot;. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Most Disappointing Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; award, which went to &quot;The Revenge of Shinobi&quot;.

<text>Basic oxygen steelmaking (BOS, BOP, BOF, or OSM), also known as Linz-Donawitz steelmaking or the oxygen converter process, is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon-rich molten pig iron is made into steel. Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into low-carbon steel. The process is known as &quot;basic&quot; because fluxes of calcium oxide or dolomite, which are chemical &quot;bases&quot;, are added to promote the removal of impurities and protect the lining of the converter.

The process was invented in 1948 by Swiss engineer Robert Durrer and commercialized in 1952–1953 by the Austrian steelmaking company VOEST and ÖAMG. The LD converter, named after the Austrian towns Linz and Donawitz (a district of Leoben) is a refined version of the Bessemer converter where blowing of air is replaced with blowing oxygen. It reduced capital cost of the plants and smelting time, and increased labor productivity. Between 1920 and 2000, labor requirements in the industry decreased by a factor of 1,000, from more than 3 man-hours per metric ton to just 0.003. By 2000 the basic oxygen furnace accounted for 60% of global steel output.

Modern furnaces will take a charge of iron of up to 400 tons and convert it into steel in less than 40 minutes, compared to 10–12 hours in an open hearth furnace.

==History==
The basic oxygen process developed outside of the traditional &quot;big steel&quot; environment. It was developed and refined by a single man, Swiss engineer Robert Durrer, and commercialized by two small steel companies in allied-occupied Austria, which had not yet recovered from the destruction of World War II.

In 1856, Henry Bessemer had patented a steelmaking process involving oxygen blowing for decarbonizing molten iron (UK Patent No. 2207). For nearly 100 years commercial quantities of oxygen were not available or were too expensive, and steelmaking used air blowing. During WWII German (Karl Valerian Schwarz), Belgian (John Miles) and Swiss (Durrer and Heinrich Heilbrugge) engineers proposed their versions of oxygen-blown steelmaking, but only Durrer and Heilbrugge brought it to mass-scale production.

In 1943, Durrer, formerly a professor at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin), returned to Switzerland and accepted a seat on the board of Roll AG, the country&#x27;s largest steel mill. In 1947 he purchased the first small 2.5-ton experimental converter from the US, and on April 3, 1948 the new converter produced its first steel. The new process could conveniently process large amounts of scrap metal with only a small proportion of primary metal necessary. In the summer of 1948, Roll AG and two Austrian state-owned companies, VÖEST and ÖAMG, agreed to commercialize the Durrer process.

By June 1949, VÖEST developed an adaptation of Durrer&#x27;s process, known as the LD (Linz-Donawitz) process. In December 1949, VÖEST and ÖAMG committed to building their first 30-ton oxygen converters. They were put into operation in November 1952 (VÖEST in Linz) and May 1953 (ÖAMG, Donawitz) and temporarily became the leading edge of the world&#x27;s steelmaking, causing a surge in steel-related research. Thirty-four thousand businesspeople and engineers visited the VÖEST converter by 1963. The LD process reduced processing time and capital costs per ton of steel, contributing to the competitive advantage of Austrian steel. VÖEST eventually acquired the rights to market the new technology. Errors by the VÖEST and the ÖAMG management in licensing their technology made control over its adoption in Japan impossible. By the end of the 1950s, the Austrians lost their competitive edge.

In the original LD process, oxygen was blown over the top of the molten iron through the water-cooled nozzle of a vertical lance. In the 1960s, steelmakers introduced bottom-blown converters and developed inert gas blowing for stirring the molten metal and removing phosphorus impurities.

In the Soviet Union, some experimental production of steel using the process was done in 1934, but industrial use was hampered by lack of efficient technology to produce liquid oxygen. In 1939, the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitsa perfected the design of the centrifugal turboexpander. The process was put to use in 1942–1944. Most turboexpanders in industrial use since then have been based on Kapitsa&#x27;s design and centrifugal turboexpanders have taken over almost 100% of industrial gas liquefaction, and in particular the production of liquid oxygen for steelmaking.

Big American steelmakers were late adopters of the new technology. The first oxygen converters in the US were launched at the end of 1954 by McLouth Steel in Trenton, Michigan, which accounted for less than 1% of the national steel market. U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel introduced the oxygen process in 1964. By 1970, half of the world&#x27;s and 80% of Japan&#x27;s steel output was produced in oxygen converters. 

In the last quarter of the 20th century, use of basic oxygen converters for steel production was gradually, partially replaced by the electric arc furnace using scrap steel and iron. In Japan the share of LD process decreased from 80% in 1970 to 70% in 2000; worldwide share of the basic oxygen process stabilized at 60%.

==Process==


Basic oxygen steelmaking is a primary steelmaking process for converting molten pig iron into steel by blowing oxygen through a lance over the molten pig iron inside the converter. Exothermic heat is generated by the oxidation reactions during blowing.

The basic oxygen steel-making process is as follows:

# Molten pig iron (sometimes referred to as &quot;hot metal&quot;) from a blast furnace is poured into a large refractory-lined container called a ladle.
# The metal in the ladle is sent directly for basic oxygen steelmaking or to a pretreatment stage where sulfur, silicon, and phosphorus are removed before charging the hot metal into the converter. In external desulfurizing pretreatment, a lance is lowered into the molten iron in the ladle and several hundred kilograms of powdered magnesium are added and the sulfur impurities are reduced to magnesium sulfide in a violent exothermic reaction. The sulfide is then raked off. Similar pretreatments are possible for external desiliconisation and external dephosphorisation using mill scale (iron oxide) and lime as fluxes. The decision to pretreat depends on the quality of the hot metal and the required final quality of the steel.
# Filling the furnace with the ingredients is called &quot;charging&quot;. The BOS process is autogenous, i.e. the required thermal energy is produced during the oxidation process. Maintaining the proper &quot;charge balance&quot;, the ratio of hot metal from melt to cold scrap is important. The BOS vessel can be tilted up to 360° and is tilted towards the deslagging side for charging scrap and hot metal. The BOS vessel is charged with steel or iron scrap (25–30%), if required. Molten iron from the ladle is added as required for the charge balance. A typical chemistry of hotmetal charged into the BOS vessel is: 4% C, 0.2–0.8% Si, 0.08%–0.18% P, and 0.01–0.04% S, all of which can be oxidised by the supplied oxygen except sulfur (which requires reducing conditions).
# The vessel is then set upright and a water-cooled, copper tipped lance with 3–7 nozzles is lowered into it to within a few feet of the surface of the bath and high-purity oxygen at a pressure of is introduced at supersonic speed. The lance &quot;blows&quot; 99% pure oxygen over the hot metal, igniting the carbon dissolved in the steel, to form carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, causing the temperature to rise to about 1700 °C. This melts the scrap, lowers the carbon content of the molten iron and helps remove unwanted chemical elements. It is this use of pure oxygen (instead of air) that improves upon the Bessemer process, as the nitrogen (an undesirable element) and other gases in air do not react with the charge, and decrease the efficiency of the furnace.
# Fluxes (calcium oxide or dolomite) are fed into the vessel to form slag, to maintain basicity of the slag – the ratio of calcium oxide to silicon oxide – at a level to minimise refractory wear and absorb impurities during the steelmaking process. During &quot;blowing&quot;, churning of metal and fluxes in the vessel forms an emulsion that facilitates the refining process. Near the end of the blowing cycle, which takes about 20 minutes, the temperature is measured and samples are taken. A typical chemistry of the blown metal is 0.3–0.9% C, 0.05–0.1% Mn, 0.001–0.003% Si, 0.01–0.03% S and 0.005–0.03% P.
# The BOS vessel is tilted towards the slagging side and the steel is poured through a tap hole into a steel ladle with basic refractory lining. This process is called &quot;tapping&quot; the steel. The steel is further refined in the ladle furnace, by adding alloying materials to impart special properties required by the customer. Sometimes argon or nitrogen is bubbled into the ladle to make the alloys mix correctly.
# After the steel is poured off from the BOS vessel, the slag is poured into the slag pots through the BOS vessel mouth and dumped.

==Variants==

Earlier converters, with a false bottom that can be detached and repaired, are still in use. Modern converters have a fixed bottom with plugs for argon purging. The energy optimization furnace (EOF) is a BOF variant associated with a scrap preheater where the sensible heat in the off-gas is used for preheating scrap, located above the furnace roof.

The lance used for blowing has undergone changes. Slagless lances, with a long tapering copper tip, have been employed to avoid jamming of the lance during blowing. Post-combustion lance tips burn the CO generated during blowing into  and provide additional heat. For slag-free tapping, darts, refractory balls, and slag detectors are employed. Modern converters are fully automated with automatic blowing patterns and sophisticated control systems.

<text>In the Japanese writing system, are variant forms of hiragana.

== Description ==
In contrast to modern Japanese, originally hiragana had several forms for a single sound. For example, while the hiragana reading &quot;ha&quot; has only one form in modern Japanese (は), until the Meiji era (1868–1912) it was written in various forms, including , , and . The shift to using only one character for each sound occurred as part of the 1900 script reform, which also included other changes to the written language to standardize spelling (and was part of a larger project to westernize the country).

Because the selection of which hiragana glyphs would become standardized was instituted by the government at the time (rather than as a natural evolution of the writing system) variant kana are effectively unused in modern Japan, save for some limited situations such as signboards, calligraphy, place names, and personal names. Today, those hiragana glyphs not used in school education since 1900 as a result of the script reform are called &quot;hentaigana&quot;.

== History ==

Hiragana, the main Japanese syllabic writing system, derived from a cursive form of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana,&quot; a system where Chinese ideograms (kanji) were used to write sounds without regard to their meaning. Originally, the same syllable (more precisely, mora) could be represented by several more-or-less interchangeable kanji, or different cursive styles of the same kanji. However, the 1900 script reform determined that only one specific character be used for each mora, with the rest being called &quot;hentaigana&quot; (&quot;variant characters&quot;). 

The 1900 standard included the hiragana ゐ, ゑ, and を, which historically stood for the phonetically distinct moras /wi/, /we/, and /wo/ but are currently pronounced as /i/, /e/, and /o/, identically to い, え, and お. The を kana is still commonly used in the Japanese writing system, instead of お, for the direct object particle /-o/. These characters were deprecated by the 1946 spelling reform. 

&quot;Hentaigana&quot; are still used occasionally today in some contexts, such as store signs and logos, to achieve the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; look.

Katakana also has variant forms, such as (ネ) and (ヰ). However, katakana&#x27;s variant forms are fewer than hiragana&#x27;s. Katakana&#x27;s choices of &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; segments had stabilized early on and established – with few exceptions – an unambiguous phonemic orthography (one symbol per sound) long before the 1900 script regularization.

== Standardized &quot;hentaigana&quot; ==
Before the proposal which led to the inclusion of &quot;hentaigana&quot; in Unicode 10.0, they were already standardized into a list by Mojikiban, part of the Japanese Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA).

To view &quot;hentaigana&quot;, special fonts need to be installed that support Hentaigana such as

* BabelStone Han
* IPA MJ Mincho (Version 5.01 and later)
* Hanazono Mincho
* Hanazono Mincho AFDKO
* UniHentaiKana
* Nishiki-teki
* Noto Serif Hentaigana

The glyph for example Hiragana &quot;wu&quot; (𛄟) also needs a special font to display such as

== Sources ==
&quot;Hentaigana&quot; are adapted from the reduced and cursive forms of the following &quot;man’yōgana&quot; (kanji) characters. Source characters for the kana are not repeated below for &quot;hentaigana&quot; even when there are alternative glyphs; some are uncertain.


















==In Unicode==

286 &quot;hentaigana&quot; characters are included in the Unicode Standard in the Kana Supplement and Kana Extended-A blocks. One character was added to Unicode version 6.0 in 2010, 𛀁 (U+1B001 HIRAGANA LETTER ARCHAIC YE which has the formal alias HENTAIGANA LETTER E-1), and the remaining 285 &quot;hentaigana&quot; characters were added in Unicode version 10.0 in June 2017.

The Unicode block for Kana Supplement is U+1B000–U+1B0FF:

The Unicode block for Kana Extended-A is U+1B100–U+1B12F:

==Modern usage==

While &quot;hentaigana&quot; started out as handwritten cursive variants of hiragana, they were used well into the modern era in printed books during the Meiji era, albeit with inconsistency. They occur sporadically in hiragana-heavy text. Some books were typeset with regular hiragana and their &quot;hentaigana&quot; variants on the same line. Here is a text sample from an 1893 book:

In this sample, is a variant of , and of , of , and of . Another book was typeset with two different spellings for the same phrase &quot;tatoe-ba&quot;: and . The same word, &quot;nashi&quot;, can be spelt with regular hiragana () and hentaigana () on the same page.

The choice between different hiragana and hentaigana could be contextual. For example, , and may be used at the beginning of a word, while , and may be used elsewhere, while was used extensively specifically for the topic particle.

&quot;Hentaigana&quot; are now considered obsolete, but a few marginal uses remain. For example, &quot;otemoto&quot; (chopsticks), is written in hentaigana on some wrappers and many soba shops use &quot;hentaigana&quot; to spell &quot;kisoba&quot; on their signs. (See also: &quot;Ye Olde&quot; for &quot;the old&quot; on English signs.)

&quot;Hentaigana&quot; are used in some formal handwritten documents, particularly in certificates issued by classical Japanese cultural groups (e.g., martial arts schools, etiquette schools, religious study groups, etc.). Also, they are occasionally used in reproductions of classic Japanese texts, akin to blackletter in English and other Germanic languages to give an archaic flair. Modern poems may be composed and printed in &quot;hentaigana&quot; for visual effect.

However, most Japanese people cannot read &quot;hentaigana&quot; nowadays, only recognizing a few from their common use in shop signs, or figuring them out from context.

<text>Quzhou is a prefecture-level city in western Zhejiang province, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Sitting on the upper course of the Qiantang River, it borders Hangzhou to the north, Jinhua to the east, Lishui to the southeast, and the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi and Anhui to the south, southwest and northwest respectively. Its population was 2,276,184 inhabitants as of the 2020 census of whom 902,767 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of Qujiang and Kecheng urban Districts.
Chinese actress and singer Zhou Xun was born in Quzhou.

==History==
=== Descendants of Confucius ===
During the Southern Song dynasty the descendant of Confucius at Qufu, the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in the north appointed Kong Duanyou&#x27;s brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. From that time up until the Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs, once in the north in Qufu and the other in the south at Quzhou. An invitation to come back to Qufu was extended to the southern Duke Yansheng Kong Zhu by the Yuan dynasty Emperor Kublai Khan. The title was taken away from the southern branch after Kong Zhu rejected the invitation, so the northern branch of the family kept the title of Duke Yansheng. The southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day. Confucius&#x27;s descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000. The Hanlin Academy rank of Wujing boshi () was awarded to the southern branch at Quzhou by a Ming Emperor while the northern branch at Qufu held the title Duke Yansheng. Kong Ruogu () aka Kong Chuan () 47th generation was claimed to be the ancestor of the Southern branch after Kong Zhu died by Northern branch member Kong Guanghuang. The leader of the southern branch is Kong Xiangkai ().

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, Imperial Japanese army used bacteriological weapons in Quzhou, spreading plague, typhoid and other diseases in Quzhou, as well as in Ningbo and Changde. As a result, between 1940 and 1948 more than 300,000 Chinese civilians in the area contracted the plague and other diseases, and an estimated 50,000 died in Quzhou alone.

On April 18, 1942, hours after bombing Tokyo, six US Army B-25 bombers crash landed near Quzhou after running out of fuel, including the leader of the raid, Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.

The highest point in the city is at Dalong Gang (), which rises to 1,500 m above sea level.

70.7% of the land is covered with forest. The rest is densely irrigated and farmed, producing citrus fruits, tea and mulberry leaves.

The north China plain is an important grain-producing areas is also the key area of nitrogen loss, Quzhou nitrogen loss in 2017 about 9000 tons, through effective to improve crops (wheat, corn, vegetables and animal (pig, eggs) in the production of reasonable management to further improve the Quzhou has been the development of the north China plain green agriculture.

<text>The Pattern 1800 Infantry Rifle, better known as the Baker rifle, was a flintlock rifle designed by English gunsmith Ezekiel Baker and used by the British Armed Forces from 1801 to 1837. First seeing action during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, it was the first British-made firearm to be issued as a service rifle to all soldiers in the British Army&#x27;s rifle units. The rifle was also used in the War of 1812, the Brazilian War of Independence and the Texas Revolution.

==History and design==
The British Army had learnt the value of rifles from their experience in the American Revolutionary War. However, existing rifle designs were considered too cumbersome, slow-firing, fragile or expensive to be put to use on any scale beyond irregular companies. Rifles had been issued on a limited basis and consisted of parts made to no precise pattern, often brought in from Prussia. The war against Revolutionary France resulted in the employment of new tactics, and the British Army responded, albeit with some delay. Prior to the formation of an &quot;Experimental Rifle Corps&quot; in 1800, a trial was held at Woolwich by the British Board of Ordnance on 22 February 1800 in order to select a standard rifle pattern; the rifle designed by Ezekiel Baker was chosen. During the trial, of the twelve shots fired, eleven were placed in a circular target at a distance of .

Colonel Coote Manningham, responsible for establishing the Rifle Corps, influenced the initial designs of the Baker. The first model resembled the British infantry musket (&quot;Brown Bess&quot;), but was rejected as too heavy. Baker was provided with a German Jäger rifle as an example of what was needed. The second model he made had a .75 caliber bore, the same caliber as the infantry musket. It had a 32-inch barrel, with eight rectangular rifling grooves; this model was accepted as the Infantry Rifle, but more changes were made until it was finally placed into production. The third and final model had the barrel shortened from 32 to 30 inches, and the caliber reduced to .653, which allowed the rifle to fire a .625 caliber carbine bullet, with a greased patch to grip the now-seven rectangular grooves in the barrel.

The rifle had a simple folding rear sight with the standard large lock mechanism (initially marked &quot;Tower&quot; and &quot;G.R.&quot; under a crown; later ones after the battle of Waterloo had &quot;Enfield&quot;), with a swan-neck cock as fitted to the &quot;Brown Bess&quot;. Like the German Jäger rifles, it had a scrolled brass trigger guard to help ensure a firm grip and a raised cheek-piece on the left-hand side of the butt. The stocks were made of walnut and held the barrel with three flat captive wedges. The rifle also had a metal locking bar to accommodate a 24-inch sword bayonet, similar to that of the Jäger rifle. The Baker was 45 inches from muzzle to butt, 12 inches shorter than the infantry musket, and weighed almost nine pounds. Although Infantry Muskets were not issued with cleaning kits, the Baker rifle had a cleaning kit, greased linen patches and tools, stored in the &quot;butt-trap&quot; or patch box; the lid of this was brass, and hinged at the rear so it could be flipped up. It was needed because, without regular cleaning, gunpowder fouling built up in the rifling grooves, and the weapon became much slower to load and less accurate.

After the Baker entered service, more modifications were made to the rifle and several variations were produced. A lighter and shorter carbine version for the cavalry was introduced, and a number of volunteer associations procured their own models, including the Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s Corps of Sharpshooters, which ordered models with a 33-inch barrel, in August 1803. A second pattern of Baker Rifle was fitted with a &quot;Newland&quot; lock that had a flat-faced ring neck cock. In 1806, a third pattern was produced that included a &quot;pistol grip&quot; style trigger guard and a smaller patch box with a plain rounded front. The lock plate was smaller, flat, and had a steeped-down tail, a raised semi-waterproof pan, a flat ring neck cock, and a sliding safety bolt. With the introduction of a new pattern Short Land Pattern Flintlock Musket (&#x27;Brown Bess&#x27;) in 1810, with its flat lock and ring-necked cock, the Baker&#x27;s lock followed suit for what became the fourth pattern. It also featured a &quot;slit stock&quot;—the stock had a slot cut in its underpart just over a quarter-inch wide. This was done after Ezekiel Baker had seen reports of the ramrod jamming in the stock after the build-up of residue in the ramrod channel, and when the wood warped after getting wet.

The rifle is referred to almost exclusively as the &quot;Baker Rifle&quot;, but it was produced by other manufacturers and sub-contractors from 1800 to 1837. Most of the rifles produced between 1800 and 1815 were not made by Ezekiel Baker, but under the Tower of London system, and he sub-contracted the manufacture of parts of the rifle to over 20 British gunsmiths. It was reported that many rifles sent to the British Army inspectors were not complete, to the extent of even having no barrel, since the rifle was sent on to another contractor for finishing. Ezekiel Baker&#x27;s production during the period 1805–1815 was 712 rifles.

The Board of Ordnance, both of its own volition and at the behest of Infantry Staff Officers, ordered production modifications during the rifle&#x27;s service life. Variations included a carbine with a safety catch and swivel-mounted ramrod, the 1801 pattern West India Rifle (a simplified version lacking a patch box), the 1809 pattern, which was .75 (musket) caliber, and the 1800/15, which was modified from existing stocks to use a socket bayonet. The most common field modification was the bent stock: riflemen in the field found that the stock was not bent sufficiently at the wrist to allow accurate firing, so stocks were bent by steaming. As this technique produces temporary results (lasting approximately five years), no examples found today exhibit this bend.

==Use==
During the Napoleonic Wars the Baker was reported to be effective at long range due to its accuracy and dependability under battlefield conditions. In spite of its advantages, the rifle did not replace the standard British musket of the day, the Brown Bess, but was issued officially only to rifle regiments. In practice, however, many regiments, such as the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welch Fusiliers), and others, acquired rifles for use by some in their light companies during the time of the Peninsular War. These units were employed as an addition to the common practice of fielding skirmishers in advance of the main column, who were used to weaken and disrupt the waiting enemy lines (the French also had a light company in each battalion that was trained and employed as skirmishers but these were only issued with muskets). With the advantage of the greater range and accuracy provided by the Baker rifle, the highly trained British skirmishers were able to defeat their French counterparts routinely and in turn disrupt the main French force by sniping at officers and NCOs.

The rifle was used by what were considered elite units, such as the 5th battalion and rifle companies of the 6th and 7th Battalions of the 60th Regiment of Foot, deployed around the world, and the three battalions of the 95th Regiment of Foot that served under the Duke of Wellington between 1808 and 1814 in the Peninsular War, the War of 1812 (3rd Batt./95th (Rifles), at Battle of New Orleans), and again in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo. The two light infantry Battalions of the King&#x27;s German Legion as well as sharpshooter platoons within the Light Companies of the KGL Line Bns also used the Baker. Each of the Portuguese &quot;Caçadores&quot; battalions included an &quot;Atiradores&quot; (sharpshooters) company equipped with the Baker rifle. The rifle was also supplied to or privately purchased by numerous volunteer and militia units; these examples often differ from the regular issue pattern. Some variants were used by cavalry, including the 10th Hussars. The Baker was also used in Canada in the War of 1812. It is recorded that the British Army still issued Baker rifles in 1841, three years after its production had ceased.

The rifle was used in several countries during the first half of the 19th century; indeed, Mexican forces at the Battle of the Alamo are known to have been carrying Baker rifles, as well as Brown Bess muskets. They were also supplied to the government of Nepal; some of these rifles were released from the stores of the Nepali Army in 2004, but many had deteriorated beyond recovery.

==Performance==
===Rate of fire===

For accurate firing, a Baker rifle could not usually be reloaded as fast as a musket, as the slightly undersized lead balls had to be wrapped in patches of greased leather or linen so that they would more closely fit the lands of the rifling. The tight-fitting patched ball took considerable force and hence more time to seat properly inside a rifle&#x27;s barrel, especially after repeated firing had fouled the barrel, compared to a loose fitting musket ball which could easily roll down. Initially, each rifleman was provided with a small mallet to help seat the ball inside the muzzle, but this later was abandoned as unnecessary.

A rifleman was expected to be able to fire two aimed shots a minute, compared to the four shots a minute for the Brown Bess musket in the hands of a trained infantryman. The average time to reload a rifle is dependent on the level of training and experience of the user, with twenty seconds (or three shots a minute) being possible for a highly proficient rifleman. Using a hand-measured powder charge for accurate long-range shots could increase the load time to as much as a minute.

Accuracy was of more importance than the rate of fire when skirmishing. The rifleman&#x27;s primary battlefield role was to utilize cover and skirmish (frequently against enemy skirmishers), whereas his musket-armed counterparts in the line infantry fired in volley or mass-fire. This could further reduce the firing rate of the rifle compared to the musket during battle.

Troops issued with the Baker rifle were also occasionally required to &quot;stand in the line&quot; and serve as regular infantry if the situation called for it. The higher rate of fire (and therefore the volume of fire) of the musket was required when deployed as line infantry, even if this came with a significant loss in accuracy. For this reason, ammunition was issued in two forms: one, loose balls, in standard carbine caliber with greased patches for accurate shooting, with loose powder inside a flask equipped with a spring-loaded charger to automatically measure out the correct amount of powder; and two, paper cartridges similar to regular musket ammunition. The requirement for the Baker armed troops to be able to perform regular infantry tasks, such as form square against cavalry, or resist a bayonet attack, led to the rather cumbersome 23½-inch-long sword-bayonet which, when fitted, made the rifle-bayonet length some 65 inches, nearly the same as a bayonet-fitted musket. There were talks early in the rifle&#x27;s adoption of additionally equipping the riflemen with short pikes instead of bayonets, but this impractical idea was never put into actual use.

===Accuracy and range===
The rifle as originally manufactured was expected to be capable of firing at a range of up to 200 yards (183 meters) with a high hit rate. The Baker rifle was used by skirmishers facing their opponents in pairs, sniping at the enemy either from positions in front of the main lines or from hidden positions in heights overlooking battlefields.

The accuracy of the rifle in capable hands is most famously demonstrated at the Battle of Cacabelos (during Moore&#x27;s retreat to Corunna in 1809) by the action of Rifleman Thomas Plunkett (or &quot;Plunket&quot;) of the 1st Battalion, 95th Rifles, who shot French General Colbert at an unknown but long range (as much as according to some sources). He then shot Colbert&#x27;s aide-de-camp, Latour-Maubourg, who went to the aid of his general, suggesting that the success of the first shot was not due to luck.

That rifleman Plunkett and others were able to regularly hit targets at ranges considered to be beyond the rifle&#x27;s effective range speaks for both their marksmanship and the capabilities of the rifle.

<text>Gerald Sheindlin (born November 19, 1933) is an American author, television personality, jurist and attorney. He spent many years as a trial judge serving the New York Supreme Court.

== Life and career ==
After serving in the Army during the Korean War, Sheindlin received a B.A. from Long Island University and a L.L.B from Brooklyn Law School, in 1959. He is the author of two books, &quot;Genetic Fingerprinting: The Law and Science of DNA Evidence&quot; and &quot;Blood Trail&quot;.

Following his career as a trial judge, Sheindlin became a television arbitrator when he replaced former New York City Mayor Ed Koch as the presiding judge on &quot;The People’s Court&quot; in the fall of 1999. This put him in competition with his wife Judith Sheindlin, a fellow former judge who presided over top-rated court show &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, which ran for 25 seasons from 1996 to 2021 and led to spin-off courtroom streaming series &quot;Judy Justice&quot;. Jerry presided over &quot;The People’s Court&quot; for the 1999–2000 season and most of the 2000–2001 season, after which he left the series and was replaced by Marilyn Milian.

== Personal life ==
He is married to Judy Sheindlin, better known as Judge Judy (so named after her court TV series). The two married in 1978, a second marriage for both. They were divorced in 1990, but they remarried in 1991. Sheindlin has 3 children (Gregory, Jonathan and Nicole), 2 stepchildren (Jamie and Adam Levy), 13 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. Jonathan A. Sheindlin is a retinal surgeon and Greg, Adam and Nicole are lawyers.

<doc id="945504" wikidata="Q144130" url="?curid=945504" title="Togo at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Togo competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its seventh appearance in the Summer Olympics since its debut at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, West Germany. The delegation included two track and field athletes and a single canoeist; Jan Sekpona in the men&#x27;s 800 metres, Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni in the women&#x27;s 400 metres, and Benjamin Boukpeti in the men&#x27;s K-1. Both Sekpona and Thiébaud-Kangni were eliminated in the first round of their competitions, while Boukpeti progressed to the semi-finals.

==Background==
Togo participated in seven Summer Olympics between its debut at the 1972 Summer Games in Munich, West Germany, and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The only occasions in that period which they did not attend was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Soviet Union. On both occasions, it was because they had joined with international boycotts of the events. In 1976, they joined with other African nations in a boycott following the inclusion of the New Zealand team at the Games despite the breach of the international sports boycott of South Africa by the nation&#x27;s rugby union team shortly prior. In 1980, Togo joined with the United States led boycott over the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.

As of 2004, the highest number of Togolese participating at any one Games was seven at the nation&#x27;s debut games in 1972. As of the 2004 Games, Togo had not yet won a medal. The first medal was won by Benjamin Boukpeti at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

The Togolese team for the 2004 Athens Games featured canoeist Boukpeti competing in the men&#x27;s K-1. This was his debut at an Olympic Games, although he would later return for both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Boukpeti had competed for France as a junior, but switched allegiance in adulthood to Togo since his father was born there. Boukpeti had only ever visited the country once, as a child. Boukpeti had changed his national allegiance in order to make Olympic qualification easier. He was the only competitor for an African national at the 2004 Games in the events held at the Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium.

In athletics, Togo entered one male and one female athlete. Jan Sekpona made his only Olympic appearance, competing in the men&#x27;s 800 metres, and Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni made the first of two Olympic appearances for Togo, in the women&#x27;s 400 metres. The two runners each qualified for the 2004 Games through the use of wildcard places, since their season best time fell outside of the &quot;B&quot; qualifying standards. Sekpona was Togo&#x27;s flag bearer during the opening ceremony.

==Athletics==

Jan Sekpona competed in the men&#x27;s 800 metres on 25 August in the third heat. He finished in one minute and 54.25 seconds, resulting in him finishing last of the eight competitors in the heat, behind Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Jasmin Salihović (one minute and 49.59 seconds). The top two athletes automatically qualified for the following round, along with Jean-Patrick Nduwimana from Burundi (one minute and 45.38 seconds) and Brazil&#x27;s Osmar dos Santos (one minute and 45.90 seconds), who each qualified as some of the fastest runners-up across all heats. Sekpona did not advance and was eliminated from Olympic competition after the first heat.

The sole female Togolese athlete at the 2004 Games, Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni, competed in the 400 metres. She ran in the fifth heat on 21 August, finishing in a time of 52.87 seconds in seventh position. This was only ahead of Sri Lanka&#x27;s Damayanthi Dharsha (54.58 seconds), but was outside the time of Mireille Nguimgo from Cameroon (51.90 seconds), who was the slowest qualifier from the heat. Thiébaud-Kangni did not progress to the following round.

;Track &amp; Road events
==Canoeing==

The sole Togolese canoeist, Benjamin Boukpeti competed in the men&#x27;s K-1 competition. He competed in the qualifying round on 19 August, finishing in 9th place during the first run with a time of 96.99 seconds. He finished his second run in 101.93 seconds, placing him in 21st place. This gave him an overall total of 198.92 seconds, which put him in 15th place. Since the top 20 finishers qualified for the semi-final, Boukpeti made his way into the next round. There was a single run for the semi-final on 20 August, with Boukpeti&#x27;s time of 102.42 seconds resulting in him finishing in 18th position out of the 20 canoeists. This was ahead of Pierpaolo Ferrazzi of Italy (103.07 seconds) and Switzerland&#x27;s Michael Kurt (103.20 seconds). Only the top ten competitors qualified for the final, ending Boukpeti&#x27;s competition.

<doc id="945508" wikidata="Q5104019" url="?curid=945508" title="Michael Flanagan (American politician)">
<text>Michael Patrick Flanagan (born November 9, 1962) is a former captain in the United States Army, a practicing attorney, and a Republican Party politician from Chicago, Illinois.

Flanagan is best known for his victory over eighteen-term Congressman Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski in the 1994 United States midterm elections. His was one of 58 Republican victories (for a net gain of 54 seats) in the House of Representatives that allowed the party to take control of both houses of Congress, as part of the Republican Revolution.

==Early life and education==
Flanagan was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 9, 1962, the second of five sons in a family of Irish-descent. He graduated from Lane Technical High School, and he earned a B.A. from Loyola University in 1984 and a J.D. from Loyola University School of Law in 1988. He served in the United States Army as a field artillery officer from 1984 to 1988 (), and from1991 to 1992 (during the Gulf War), achieving the rank of captain.

Flanagan was admitted to the Illinois State Bar Association in 1991.

==Political career==
Flanagan was elected to represent the fifth district of Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994, defeating 18-term Congressman and former Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski, becoming the first Republican to represent a significant portion of Chicago since 1975 and the first to represent this district since 1909. Rostenkowski was under indictment during the election.

The election result was a considerable upset, considering that Flanagan was, according to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;a political neophyte who was underfunded, understaffed and unknown.&quot; Due to his victory, Flanagan earned the nicknames of &quot;the accidental congressman&quot; and &quot;the Rosty-slayer.&quot;

During his tenure in Congress, Flanagan served on the House Judiciary Committee, the House Government Reform Committee, and the Joint Committee on Telecommunications. He had a conservative record in the House, opposing abortion and gun control, while supporting the death penalty. He also condemned then-President Clinton&#x27;s national healthcare plan for its government takeover of the healthcare system.

While the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; both endorsed Flanagan for reelection in 1996, he was regarded as a heavy underdog against the Democratic challenger, State Representative Rod Blagojevich, being a conservative Republican in a strongly Democratic district. Before Flanagan&#x27;s election, the district and its predecessors had been in Democratic hands for all but one year since 1909. As expected, the district reverted to form; Blagojevich soundly defeated Flanagan, and Bill Clinton easily carried the district. Flanagan&#x27;s loss was one of the 12 seats first-term Republican candidates lost in the 1996 election. Proving just how Democratic this district was and still is, no Republican has tallied more than 35 percent of the vote since Flanagan left office. As of 2024, he is the last Republican to represent a significant part of Chicago in the U.S. House.

Flanagan worked in Iraq for two years for the U.S. State Department, as part of a team sent to help set up democratic institutions in the country.

<doc id="945521" wikidata="Q6058862" url="?curid=945521" title="Fatty liver disease">
<text>Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.

The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly &quot;non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&quot; (NAFLD)) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), with the category &quot;metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease&quot; (metALD) describing an overlap of the two.

The primary risks include alcohol, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Other risk factors include certain medications such as glucocorticoids, and hepatitis C. It is unclear why some people with NAFLD develop simple fatty liver and others develop nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is associated with poorer outcomes. Diagnosis is based on the medical history supported by blood tests, medical imaging, and occasionally liver biopsy.

Treatment of NAFLD is generally by dietary changes and exercise to bring about weight loss. In those who are severely affected, liver transplantation may be an option. More than 90% of heavy drinkers develop fatty liver while about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis. NAFLD affects about 30% of people in Western countries and 10% of people in Asia. NAFLD affects about 10% of children in the United States. It occurs more often in older people and males.

== Classification ==
Fatty liver disease was classified into:
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) made up of:
** Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) or simple fatty liver
** Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
* Alcoholic liver disease (ALD).
In 2023, a new nomenclature was chosen, with the classifications including:
* Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), including:
** Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)
* Metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease (metALD). Describes those with MASLD who consume greater amounts of alcohol per week but not enough to be categorized as ALD)
* Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD)
* Specific aetiology SLD (including drug-induced, monogenic diseases and others)

==Signs and symptoms==
Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen.

===Complications===
Fatty liver can develop into hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis or liver cancer. For people affected by NAFLD, the 10-year survival rate was about 80%. The rate of progression of fibrosis is estimated to be one per 7 years in NASH and one per 14 years in NAFLD, with an increasing speed. There is a strong relationship between these pathologies and metabolic illnesses (diabetes type II, metabolic syndrome). These pathologies can also affect non-obese people, who are then at a higher risk.

Less than 10% of people with cirrhotic alcoholic FLD will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults, but up to 45% people with NASH without cirrhosis can develop hepatocellular carcinoma.

The condition is also associated with other diseases that influence fat metabolism.

==Causes==

Fatty liver (FL) is commonly associated with metabolic syndrome (diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia), but can also be due to any one of many causes:
;Alcohol: Alcohol use disorder is one of the causes of fatty liver due to production of toxic metabolites like aldehydes during metabolism of alcohol in the liver. This phenomenon most commonly occurs with chronic alcohol use disorder.
;Metabolic: abetalipoproteinemia, glycogen storage diseases, Weber–Christian disease, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, lipodystrophy
;Nutritional: obesity, malnutrition, total parenteral nutrition, severe weight loss, refeeding syndrome, jejunoileal bypass, gastric bypass, jejunal diverticulosis with bacterial overgrowth
;Drugs and toxins: amiodarone, methotrexate, diltiazem, expired tetracycline, highly active antiretroviral therapy, glucocorticoids, tamoxifen, environmental hepatotoxins (e.g., phosphorus, mushroom poisoning)
;Other: celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV, hepatitis C (especially genotype 3), and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency

==Pathology==

The fatty change represents the intracytoplasmatic accumulation of triglycerides (neutral fats). At the beginning, the hepatocytes present small fat vacuoles (liposomes) around the nucleus (microvesicular fatty change). In this stage, liver cells are filled with multiple fat droplets that do not displace the centrally located nucleus. In the late stages, the size of the vacuoles increases, pushing the nucleus to the periphery of the cell, giving a characteristic signet ring appearance (macrovesicular fatty change). These vesicles are well-delineated and optically &quot;empty&quot; because fats dissolve during tissue processing. Large vacuoles may coalesce and produce fatty cysts, which are irreversible lesions. Macrovesicular steatosis is the most common form and is typically associated with alcohol, diabetes, obesity, and corticosteroids. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy and Reye&#x27;s syndrome are examples of severe liver disease caused by microvesicular fatty change. The diagnosis of steatosis is made when fat in the liver exceeds 5–10% by weight.
Defects in fatty acid metabolism are responsible for pathogenesis of FLD, which may be due to imbalance in energy consumption and its combustion, resulting in lipid storage, or can be a consequence of peripheral resistance to insulin, whereby the transport of fatty acids from adipose tissue to the liver is increased.
Impairment or inhibition of receptor molecules (PPAR-α, PPAR-γ and SREBP1) that control the enzymes responsible for the oxidation and synthesis of fatty acids appears to contribute to fat accumulation. In addition, alcohol use disorder is known to damage mitochondria and other cellular structures, further impairing cellular energy mechanism. On the other hand, non-alcoholic FLD may begin as excess of unmetabolised energy in liver cells. Hepatic steatosis is considered reversible and to some extent nonprogressive if the underlying cause is reduced or removed.
Severe fatty liver is sometimes accompanied by inflammation, a situation referred to as steatohepatitis. Progression to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) depends on the persistence or severity of the inciting cause. Pathological lesions in both conditions are similar. However, the extent of inflammatory response varies widely and does not always correlate with degree of fat accumulation. Steatosis (retention of lipid) and onset of steatohepatitis may represent successive stages in FLD progression.

Liver disease with extensive inflammation and a high degree of steatosis often progresses to more severe forms of the disease. Hepatocyte ballooning and necrosis of varying degrees are often present at this stage. Liver cell death and inflammatory responses lead to the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which play a pivotal role in hepatic fibrosis. The extent of fibrosis varies widely. Perisinusoidal fibrosis is most common, especially in adults, and predominates in zone 3 around the terminal hepatic veins.

The progression to cirrhosis may be influenced by the amount of fat and degree of steatohepatitis and by a variety of other sensitizing factors. In alcoholic FLD, the transition to cirrhosis related to continued alcohol consumption is well-documented, but the process involved in non-alcoholic FLD is less clear.

==Diagnosis==


Most individuals are asymptomatic and are usually discovered incidentally because of abnormal liver function tests or hepatomegaly noted in unrelated medical conditions. Elevated liver enzymes are found in as many as 50% of patients with simple steatosis. The serum alanine transaminase (ALT) level usually is greater than the aspartate transaminase (AST) level in the nonalcoholic variant and the opposite in alcoholic FLD (AST:ALT more than 2:1). Simple blood tests may help to determine the magnitude of the disease by assessing the degree of liver fibrosis. For example, AST-to-platelets ratio index (APRI score) and several other scores, calculated from the results of blood tests, can detect the degree of liver fibrosis and predict the future formation of liver cancer.

Imaging studies are often obtained during the evaluation process. Ultrasonography reveals a &quot;bright&quot; liver with increased echogenicity. Pocket-sized ultrasound devices might be used as point-of-care screening tools to diagnose liver steatosis. Medical imaging can aid in diagnosis of fatty liver; fatty livers have lower density than spleens on computed tomography (CT), and fat appears bright in T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Magnetic resonance elastography, a variant of magnetic resonance imaging, is investigated as a non-invasive method to diagnose fibrosis progression. Online calculators have been developed to assist in evaluating hepatic steatosis using CT and MRI findings. Histological diagnosis by liver biopsy is the most accurate measure of fibrosis and liver fat progression as of 2018. Conventional imaging methods, such as ultrasound, CT and MRI, are not specific enough to detect fatty liver disease unless fat occupies at least 30% of the liver volume.

==Treatment==
Decreasing caloric intake by at least 30% or by approximately 750–1,000 kcal/day results in improvement in hepatic steatosis. For people with NAFLD or NASH, weight loss via a combination of diet and exercise was shown to improve or resolve the disease. In more serious cases, medications that decrease insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and those that induce weight loss such as bariatric surgery as well as vitamin E have been shown to improve or resolve liver function.

Bariatric surgery, while not recommended in 2017 as a treatment for FLD alone, has been shown to revert FLD, NAFLD, NASH and advanced steatohepatitis in over 90% of people who have undergone this surgery for the treatment of obesity.

In the case of long-term total-parenteral-nutrition-induced fatty liver disease, choline has been shown to alleviate symptoms. This may be due to a deficiency in the methionine cycle.

==Epidemiology==
NAFLD affects about 30% of people in Western countries and 10% of people in Asia.
In the United States, rates are around 35% with about 7% having the severe form NASH. NAFLD affects about 10% of children in the United States. Recently the term Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has been proposed to replace NAFLD. MAFLD is a more inclusionary diagnostic name as it is based on the detection of fatty liver by histology (biopsy), medical imaging or blood biomarkers but should be accompanied by either overweight/obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic dysregulation. The new definition no longer excludes alcohol consumption or coexistence of other liver diseases such as viral hepatitis. Using this more inclusive definition, the global prevalence of MAFLD is an astonishingly high 50.7%. Indeed, also using the old NAFLD definition, the disease is observed in up to 80% of obese people, 35% of whom progress to NASH, and in up to 20% of normal weight people, despite no evidence of excessive alcohol consumption. FLD is the most common cause of abnormal liver function tests in the United States. Fatty liver is more prevalent in Hispanic people than white, with black people having the lowest prevalence.

In the study Children of the 90s, 2.5% born in 1991 and 1992 were found by ultrasound at the age of 18 to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; five years later transient elastography found over 20% to have the fatty deposits on the liver, indicating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; half of those were classified as severe. The scans also found that 2.4% had a degree of liver fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.

After the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, a study demonstrated that 48% of patients with liver steatosis gained weight, while 16% had a worsened steatosis grade. Weight gain was associated with poor adherence to the suggested diet, reduced levels of physical activity, and increased prevalence of homozygosity for the &quot;PNPLA3&quot; rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism. &quot;PNPLA3&quot; rs738409 is already a known risk factor for NAFLD.

== Research ==
A systematic review and meta-analysis, published in 2024, found that growth hormone therapy may help in the management of fatty liver disease.

==In animals==
Fatty liver disease can occur in pets such as reptiles (particularly turtles) and birds as well as mammals like cats and dogs. The most common cause is overnutrition. A distinct sign in birds is a misshapen beak. Fatty livers can be induced via gavage in geese or ducks to produce foie gras. Fatty liver can also be induced in ruminants such as sheep by a high-caloric diet.

<text>Uzbekistan competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third consecutive appearance at the Olympics. The National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan sent a total of 70 athletes to the Games, 52 men and 18 women, to compete in 13 different sports, tying its delegation record with Sydney four years earlier. There was only a single competitor in road cycling, artistic and trampoline gymnastics, and table tennis.

Seventeen athletes from the Uzbek team had previously competed in Sydney, including artistic gymnast and three-time Olympic medalist Oksana Chusovitina (who transferred to Germany in 2002 to treat her ailing son Alisher from leukemia), freestyle wrestler Artur Taymazov, who won silver in men&#x27;s super heavyweight, sprint freestyle swimmer and Asian Games champion Ravil Nachaev, trampoline gymnast Ekaterina Khilko, and heavyweight judoka Abdullo Tangriev, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. At age 15, backstroke swimmer Olga Gnedovskaya set a historical milestone for Uzbekistan as the youngest ever athlete in history to compete at the Olympics. Other notable Uzbek athletes featured road cyclist and world junior champion Sergey Lagutin, canoeist Anton Ryahov, who later competed for the Russian at his subsequent Olympics, and swimming siblings Danil Bugakov and Mariya Bugakova.

Uzbekistan left Athens with a total of five medals, two golds, one silver, and two bronze, being considered its most successful Olympics in history since the post-Soviet era. Three of these medals were awarded to the athletes in wrestling, including a prestigious gold from Taymazov in men&#x27;s super heavyweight freestyle. Meanwhile, boxers Bahodirjon Sultonov and Utkirbek Haydarov managed to claim bronze medals in their respective weight classes.

<doc id="945530" wikidata="Q7259676" url="?curid=945530" title="Pulse-forming network">
<text>A pulse-forming network (PFN) is an electric circuit that accumulates electrical energy over a comparatively long time, and then releases the stored energy in the form of a relatively square pulse of comparatively brief duration for various pulsed power applications. In a PFN, energy storage components such as capacitors, inductors or transmission lines are charged by means of a high-voltage power source, then rapidly discharged into a load through a high-voltage switch, such as a spark gap or hydrogen thyratron. Repetition rates range from single pulses to about 104 per second. PFNs are used to produce uniform electrical pulses of short duration to power devices such as klystron or magnetron tube oscillators in radar sets, pulsed lasers, particle accelerators, flashtubes, and high-voltage utility test equipment.

Much high-energy research equipment is operated in a pulsed mode, both to keep heat dissipation down and because high-energy physics often occurs at short time scales, so large PFNs are widely used in high-energy research. They have been used to produce nanosecond-length pulses with voltages of up to 106–107 volts and currents up to 106 amperes, with peak power in the terawatt range, similar to lightning bolts.

==Implementation==
A PFN consists of a series of high-voltage energy-storage capacitors and inductors. These components are interconnected as a &quot;&quot;ladder network&quot; that behaves similarly to a length of transmission line. For this reason, a PFN is sometimes called an &quot;artificial, or synthetic, transmission line&quot;&quot;. Electrical energy is initially stored within the charged capacitors of the PFN by a high-voltage DC power supply. When the PFN is discharged, the capacitors discharge in sequence, producing an approximately rectangular pulse. The pulse is conducted to the load through a transmission line. The PFN must be impedance-matched to the load to prevent the energy reflecting back toward the PFN.

==Transmission-line PFNs==
A length of transmission line can be used as a pulse-forming network. This can give substantially flat-topped pulses at the inconvenience of using of a large length of cable.

In a simple charged transmission-line pulse generator (animation, right) a length of transmission line such as a coaxial cable is connected through a switch to a matched load &quot;R&quot;L at one end, and at the other end to a DC voltage source &quot;V&quot; through a resistor &quot;R&quot;S, which is large compared to the characteristic impedance &quot;Z&quot;0 of the line. When the power supply is connected, it slowly charges up the capacitance of the line through &quot;R&quot;S. When the switch is closed, a voltage equal to &quot;V&quot;/2 is applied to the load, the charge stored in the line begins to discharge through the load with a current of &quot;V&quot;/2&quot;Z&quot;0, and a voltage step travels up the line toward the source. The source end of the line is approximately an open circuit due to the high &quot;R&quot;S, so the step is reflected uninverted and travels back down the line toward the load. The result is that a pulse of voltage is applied to the load with a duration equal to 2&quot;D&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is the length of the line, and &quot;c&quot; is the propagation velocity of the pulse in the line. The propagation velocity in typical transmission lines is generally more than 50% of the speed of light. For example, in most types of coaxial cable the propagation velocity is approximately 2/3 the speed of light, or 20 cm/ns.

High-power PFNs generally use specialized transmission lines consisting of pipes filled with oil or deionized water as a dielectric to handle the high power stress.

A disadvantage of simple PFN pulse generators is that because the transmission line must be matched to the load resistance &quot;R&quot;L to prevent reflections, the voltage stored on the line is divided equally between the load resistance and the characteristic impedance of the line, so the voltage pulse applied to the load is only one-half the power-supply voltage.

=== Blumlein transmission line===
A transmission line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse equal to the power-supply voltage &quot;V&quot;, was invented in 1937 by British engineer Alan Blumlein and is widely used today in PFNs. In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal-length transmission lines, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the right line is charged through the impedance of the load). To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits the line at the power-supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance &quot;Z&quot;0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance &quot;R&quot;L, the voltage step is half-reflected and half-transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite-polarity voltage steps, which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of &quot;V&quot;/2 − (−&quot;V&quot;/2)= &quot;V&quot; across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge-line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2&quot;D&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is the length of the individual transmission lines. A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high-voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics.

==Uses of PFNs==
Upon command, a high-voltage switch transfers the energy stored within the PFN into the load. When the switch &quot;&quot;fires&quot; (closes), the network of capacitors and inductors within the PFN creates an approximately square output pulse of short duration and high power. This high-power pulse becomes a brief source of high power to the load.

Sometimes a specially designed pulse transformer is connected between the PFN and load. This technique improves the impedance match between the PFN and the load so as to improve power-transfer efficiency. A pulse transformer is typically required when driving higher-impedance devices such as klystrons or magnetrons from a PFN. Because the PFN is charged over a relatively long time and then discharged over a very short time, the output pulse may have a peak power of megawatts or even terawatts.

The combination of a high-voltage source, PFN, HV switch, and pulse transformer (when required) is sometimes called a &quot;power modulator&quot; or &quot;pulser&quot;.

<text>MillionPlus, formerly known as million+, the Campaign for Mainstream Universities, and the Coalition of Modern Universities (CMU), is a membership organisation, which aims to promote the role of &quot;modern universities&quot; in the UK higher education system; it describes itself as &quot;The Association for Modern Universities in the UK&quot;. MillionPlus is not for profit and funded by subscriptions from its members, currently 23 UK universities. While all of the member institutions are &quot;new&quot; universities, many have long histories as colleges and polytechnics.

==Overview==
Formed in 1997 as the Coalition of Modern Universities, the name was changed in 2004 to the Campaign for Mainstream Universities. In November 2007, the organisation was rebranded to million+. This name was chosen to reflect the fact that the member institutions educate over a million students. In April 2016, the organisation rebranded again to MillionPlus.

MillionPlus is involved in the political debate about the role and contribution of universities to the economy and society, where it is seen as representing the post-1992 universities, known as &#x27;new&#x27; or &#x27;modern&#x27;. As such, it is frequently quoted in the media on higher education topics, such as the Government&#x27;s green paper on higher education reform, reform of the external examination system, and the economic diversity of the student population.

The group is chaired by Professor Rama Thirunamachandran, Vice-Chancellor of Canterbury Christ Church University.
The Chief Executive is Rachel Hewitt.

<doc id="945547" wikidata="Q142745" url="?curid=945547" title="Uganda at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Uganda competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twelfth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, because of the African boycott. The Ugandan Olympic Committee sent a total of eleven athletes to the Games, nine men and two women, to compete in four different sports. Half of these athletes had been participating in boxing, including Joseph Lubega, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. There was only a single competitor in swimming and weightlifting.

Uganda left Athens without a single Olympic medal, since the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where John Akii-Bua won the gold in the men&#x27;s 400 m hurdles. The nation&#x27;s best result came with a fourth-place finish from Boniface Kiprop in the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres.

==Athletics==

Ugandan athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard).

<doc id="945562" wikidata="Q1131060" url="?curid=945562" title="Interstate 471">
<text>Interstate 471 (I-471) is a Interstate Highway, linking I-71 in Downtown Cincinnati, Ohio, to I-275 in Highland Heights, Kentucky. South of I-275, the expressway continues south to U.S. Route 27 (US 27) as unsigned Kentucky Route 471 (KY 471).

==Route description==

The southern terminus of I-471 is at an interchange with I–275 and US 27. I-471 heads northwest, then turns northeast, having an interchange with US 27 in Southgate. After US 27, I-471 turns back northwest, heading toward Cincinnati. On the way to Cincinnati, I-471 passes through the east side of Newport. On the east side of Newport, I-471 has an interchange with KY 8. I-471 crosses the Ohio River using the Daniel Carter Beard Bridge, a Cincinnati landmark. After the Ohio River crossing, I-471 has an interchange with US 50. After the interchange with US 50, I-471 has an interchange with I-71 northeast of Downtown Cincinnati. The northern terminus of I-471 is at the interchange with I-71.

==History==
I-471 was first envisioned in 1961 as an east–west connector between I-71/I-75 in Covington, Kentucky, with I-71 in Cincinnati, Ohio, crossing the Ohio River at a spot close to the current location. In effect, this connection would have provided for an alternative to I-71, creating an inner loop system that would span both Ohio and Kentucky. Since this freeway would have hugged the southern riverfront, I-471 would have prevented access to the Ohio River from Kentucky.

By 1967, the freeway was planned for a new alignment, much like the one seen today, connecting Cincinnati, Ohio, with Newport, Kentucky. On December 10, 1967, plans called for a north–south, freeway that would connect I-71 with I-275 near the interchange with US 27. I-471 would have three lanes in each direction (which has since been reworked into four lanes in each direction due to a construction project).

The bridge between Newport and Cincinnati was constructed between November 1971 and September 1976 and named after Covington native Daniel Carter Beard, the founder of the Boy Scouts of America. It developed the nickname of the &quot;Big Mac Bridge&quot; because its massive yellow arches over the river resemble the golden arches of McDonald&#x27;s restaurants. The Daniel Carter Beard Bridge was fully dedicated in 1981.

Subsequent construction extended the freeway south from the bridge in phases, with the last segment of I-471 opening in 1980 at its junction with US 27 south of I-275. In 1981, the cost to construct the freeway and bridge was calculated to be $85 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Kentucky Route 471 was originally assigned to the road from US 25W in Jellico to US 25W in Saxton. This was renumbered to KY 1804 in 1961 when I-471 was designated.

<doc id="945565" wikidata="Q1027067" url="?curid=945565" title="Calkin algebra">
<text>In functional analysis, the Calkin algebra, named after John Williams Calkin, is the quotient of &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), the ring of bounded linear operators on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;, by the ideal &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) of compact operators. Here the addition in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is addition of operators and the multiplication in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is composition of operators; it is easy to verify that these operations make &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) into a ring. When scalar multiplication is also included, &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) becomes in fact an algebra over the same field over which &quot;H&quot; is a Hilbert space.

== Properties ==

* Since &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is a maximal norm-closed ideal in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), the Calkin algebra is simple. In fact, &quot;K&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) is the only closed ideal in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;).

* As a quotient of a C*-algebra by a two-sided ideal, the Calkin algebra is a C*-algebra itself and there is a short exact sequence
::formula_1
:which induces a six-term cyclic exact sequence in K-theory. Those operators in &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;) which are mapped to an invertible element of the Calkin algebra are called Fredholm operators, and their index can be described both using K-theory and directly. One can conclude, for instance, that the collection of unitary operators in the Calkin algebra consists of homotopy classes indexed by the integers Z. This is in contrast to &quot;B&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), where the unitary operators are path connected.

* As a C*-algebra, the Calkin algebra is not isomorphic to an algebra of operators on a separable Hilbert space. The Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction implies that the Calkin algebra is isomorphic to an algebra of operators on a nonseparable Hilbert space, but while for many other C*-algebras there are explicit descriptions of such Hilbert spaces, the Calkin algebra does not have an explicit representation.

* The existence of an outer automorphism of the Calkin algebra is shown to be independent of ZFC, by work of Phillips and Weaver, and Farah.

== Generalizations ==

* One can define a Calkin algebra for any infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space, not just separable ones.

* An analogous construction can be made by replacing &quot;H&quot; with a Banach space, which is also called a Calkin algebra.

* The Calkin algebra is the Corona algebra of the algebra of compact operators on a Hilbert space.

<text>Siwucha () is an incompletely rectified vodka (raw vodka) from Poland. The name derives from the &quot;siwy&quot; (ash grey) color of the liquid due to Tyndall effect of the colloid emulsion of residual fusel oil.

==History==
Siwucha is one of the generic Slavic words for a moonshine. In Polish it denotes a home-brew vodka or rotgut used for its preparation. 
The name was first used as a vodka brand in Warsaw shortly before World War I. It was in production by various distilleries in Poland during the interbellum. After the World War II all distilleries were nationalised and its production was halted. In 1995 the Polmos distillery in Zielona Góra reintroduced it as a way to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the company&#x27;s foundation.

It is sold in 0.5 litre bottles, corked and sealed with sealing wax.

==Technology==
The vodka is composed of a mixture of two rectified grain spirits. The mixture is then seasoned in oak barrels and a scent of forest fruit flavour is added. It&#x27;s specific flavor can be attributed to blackthorn extract.

<doc id="945584" wikidata="Q141662" url="?curid=945584" title="Morocco at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Morocco competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eleventh appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its partial support to the United States boycott.

Comité Olympique Marocain sent a total of 55 athletes, 47 men and 8 women, to compete in 9 sports. Men&#x27;s football was the only team-based sport in which Morocco had its representation at these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in fencing, swimming, and weightlifting. The Moroccan team featured four Olympic medalists from Sydney: boxer Tahar Tamsamani, steeplechaser Ali Ezzine, middle-distance runner and top favorite Hicham El Guerrouj, and hurdler and former world champion Nezha Bidouane, who later became the nation&#x27;s first ever female flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Morocco left Athens with a total of three Olympic medals (two gold and one silver), being considered the most successful Olympics based on the gold medal count. As one of the major highlights of these Games, Hicham El Guerrouj set an Olympic historical milestone as the first ever Moroccan athlete to strike a distance double (1500–5000) since Paavo Nurmi did so in 1924, and the first to claim a gold since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, where Khalid Skah won the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres title. On August 29, 2004, at the time of the closing ceremony, El Guerrouj was elected to the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission, along with three other athletes. Meanwhile, the silver medal was awarded to fellow middle-distance runner Hasna Benhassi in the women&#x27;s 800 metres.

<doc id="945590" wikidata="Q1605321" url="?curid=945590" title="Steve Stockman">
<text>Stephen Ernest Stockman (born November 14, 1956) is an American politician who is a member of the Republican Party and a convicted felon. He served as the U.S. representative for Texas&#x27;s 9th congressional district from 1995 to 1997 and for Texas&#x27;s 36th congressional district from 2013 to 2015. Stockman ran in the Republican primary for the United States Senate in the 2014 election but lost to incumbent Senator John Cornyn.

In 2018, Stockman was convicted on 23 felony counts related to money laundering and misuse of campaign contributions. He was sentenced to serve ten years in prison, and was ordered to pay $1 million in restitution.

On December 22, 2020, President Donald Trump commuted Stockman&#x27;s prison term.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Stockman was born in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, outside Detroit. His parents were evangelistic Christian teachers. He graduated from Dondero High School in Royal Oak, Michigan. From 1985 to 1986, he attended San Jacinto College but dropped out because he suffered from what he called &quot;partying syndrome&quot;. In 1977 as Stockman was reporting to jail for traffic tickets, the jailers found valium in his possession after his girlfriend allegedly hid some in his underwear. He was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance, but the charge was later dropped. He later became a born-again Christian. In 1990, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in accounting from the University of Houston–Clear Lake. He worked as a computer salesman in Friendswood, Texas.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1995–1997)==
===Elections===
1990

Stockman&#x27;s first run for Congress was in March 1990 in Texas&#x27;s 9th congressional district. The district, anchored by Beaumont and Galveston, had been represented by Democratic Representative Jack Brooks since 1953. His primary challenger was Beaumont Mayor Maury Meyers. Oliver North made appearances at two of Stockman&#x27;s fundraisers.

Meyers got 44.3% of the primary vote; Stockman, 41%. Since no candidate had a majority, there was a runoff election and, with the support of third-place finisher Steve Clifford, Meyers beat Stockman to win the Republican nomination.

1992

Stockman ran again in 1992 for the House in District 9. This time he was unopposed in the primary. The 1992 Republican National Convention was held in Houston in August of that year. Stockman organized a &quot;congressional cruise&quot; on the Houston Ship Channel as a fundraising opportunity, but no members of Congress attended. Democrat Brooks defeated him 56% to 44%.

1994

Stockman ran again for House District 9 in 1994. He had two challengers in the Republican primary: John LeCour and James Milburn. Stockman won the primary with a landslide 74%.

His Democratic opponent in the general election was, as before, incumbent Jack Brooks. Initially the NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) endorsed Brooks and even donated $5,000 to his cause, while the Gun Owners of America endorsed Stockman. However, a number of NRA members threatened to resign from the organization over the issue and the NRA withdrew their support for Brooks, remaining neutral in the race. In a major upset, Stockman beat Brooks, who, had he won, would have become Dean of the United States House of Representatives, by 51% to 49%.

1996

Stockman ran unopposed in the 1996 Republican primary. In July a federal court ordered the boundaries of 13 Texas House districts to be redrawn because of racial gerrymandering, although Stockman&#x27;s district was barely affected. Stockman won a plurality in the November election with 46%, forcing a runoff against Democratic Jefferson County assessor Nick Lampson. Lampson won the runoff election with 53% of the vote.

===Tenure===
During his 1995 term, Stockman opposed the U.S. bailout of the Mexican peso.

In 1995, Stockman wrote an article for &quot;Guns &amp; Ammo&quot; claiming that the Waco siege had been orchestrated by the Clinton administration in order &quot;to prove the need for a ban on so-called &#x27;assault weapons.&#x27;&quot; He wrote further that &quot;[h]ad Bill Clinton really been unhappy with what Attorney General Janet Reno ordered, he would not only have fired her, he would have had Reno indicted for premeditated murder.&quot; After the article was published, Stockman&#x27;s office denied that he believed in Waco &quot;conspiracy theories.&quot;

In 1995, Stockman called for a Congressional investigation into Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s 1948 study &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; after learning that Kinsey had used data from the diary of a pedophile. Stockman believed that the allegations discredited current theories of sexual education in the United States, writing to his congressional colleagues that&quot;[o]ur children have been taught that ... any type of sex is a valid outlet for their emotions. They are taught that the problem with sex is not that it is wrong to engage in homosexual, bestial, underage, or premarital sex, but that it is wrong to do so without protection.&quot;

In 1995 and 1996, Stockman was proud to have played a role in the federal government&#x27;s shutdown. A 2010 Congressional Research Service report summarized other details of the 1995–1996 government shutdowns, indicating the shutdown impacted all sectors of the economy. Health and welfare services for military veterans were curtailed; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped disease surveillance; new clinical research patients were not accepted at the National Institutes of Health; and toxic waste cleanup at 609 sites was halted. Other impacts included: the closure of 368 National Park sites resulted in the loss of some seven million visitors; 200,000 applications for passports were not processed; and 20,000-30,000 applications by foreigners for visas went unprocessed each day; U.S. tourism and airline industries incurred millions of dollars in losses; more than 20% of federal contracts, representing $3.7 billion in spending, were affected adversely. The first of the two shutdowns caused the furlough of about 800,000 workers, while the second caused about 284,000 workers to be furloughed. They were said to have cost Stockman his reelection in 1996, and the Republican loss of seven seats in the House.

==Inter-congressional career (1997–2013)==
In 1998, Stockman ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the Texas Railroad Commission.

Between 2005 and 2007, Stockman worked with the conservative Leadership Institute as director of its Campus Leadership Program.

In 2006, he attempted to run as an independent candidate for Texas&#x27;s 22nd congressional district, Tom DeLay&#x27;s former seat, and even though he had enough signatures to qualify for ballot access, the Texas Secretary of State invalidated enough signatures to make him ineligible. Stockman registered for the special election to fill out the remainder of DeLay&#x27;s term; he was one of five candidates. He finished third, with 10.75% of the vote.

During his time away from Congress, Stockman also cared for his father, who had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The cost of caring for him drove Stockman to declare bankruptcy and, when his father&#x27;s disease became too severe, Stockman moved him to a veterans&#x27; home. When his father died, Stockman decided to run for Congress in the 2012 elections.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2015)==
===Election===
In 2011 Stockman formed an exploratory committee, Friends of Steve Stockman, to consider a run for the 14th district seat being vacated by unsuccessful presidential candidate Ron Paul. Stockman instead ran in 2012 in the newly created 36th District. It included the Harris County portion of Friendswood, where Stockman&#x27;s home was located. The district was drawn to be heavily Republican, and it was understood that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district&#x27;s first congressman. In the May 29 primary, Stockman finished second in the first round, behind Stephen Vincent Takach, a financial planner. Takach finished with 22 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent threshold required to win. Stockman defeated Takach in the July 31 runoff 55%–45%, all but assuring his return to Congress after a 16-year absence.

In the November general election, Stockman defeated Democrat Max Owen Martin, a retired pilot from Clear Lake City, Texas, with 71% of the vote.

===Tenure===
In 2013, Stockman was one of ten Republicans who did not vote for John Boehner (R-Ohio) for Speaker of the House; he was the only representative to vote &quot;Present&quot; as his protest vote.

Stockman opposes the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In 2013, Stockman supported a government shutdown caused by Republican members of Congress who sought to block a continuing resolution that includes funding for the Affordable Care Act. Stockman&#x27;s last-minute decision to challenge Cornyn in the Republican primary for Senate was &quot;sparked in part by Cornyn&#x27;s role in helping end&quot; the federal shutdown.

In January 2013, Stockman introduced the &quot;Safe Schools Act,&quot; a bill that would repeal the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. Stockman introduced the bill following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He asserted that &quot;By disarming qualified citizens and officials in schools we have created a dangerous situation for our children.&quot; The same month, Stockman issued a press release condemning gun control executive orders issued by President Barack Obama post-Sandy Hook, stating, &quot;I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary, including but not limited to eliminating funding for implementation, defunding the White House, and even filing articles of impeachment.&quot;

In February 2013, Stockman voted against the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, objecting to provisions in the bill that expanded protections for transgender victims of domestic violence. Stockman said, &quot;This is helping the liberals, this is horrible. Unbelievable. What really bothers—it&#x27;s called a women&#x27;s act, but then they have men dressed up as women, they count that. Change-gender, or whatever. How is that—how is that a woman?&quot; That same month, Stockman also invited Ted Nugent, noted for his violent criticisms of Obama and other Democratic figures, to the 2013 State of the Union Address address.

On April 25, 2014, Stockman stated that the House Ethics Committee was investigating a campaign finance reporting error made by a former campaign worker. Stockman said the mistake was corrected soon after he learned of it, and that the worker had been removed from the campaign organization.

==2014 U.S. Senate election==

On December 9, 2013, Stockman filed for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate for Texas against incumbent U.S. Senator John Cornyn. On December 31, Stockman visited Bitcoin center NYC to raise money and became the first U.S. Senate candidate to officially accept campaign contributions in cryptocurrency.

Donald &quot;Donny&quot; Ferguson, the former executive director of Western Tradition Partnership/American Tradition Partnership (ATP) and manager of their Washington, D.C. office, resigned on 3 January 2013, as it continued to suffer adverse rulings in Montana courts over alleged campaign finance violations. Ferguson then became the congressional staffer and then U.S. Senate campaign spokesperson for Stockman.

On March 4, 2014, Stockman polled 250,759 votes (19.2 percent) in his bid for the Republican nomination for the Senate. He placed second in a field of eight candidates on the ballot. Cornyn received 778,967 votes (59.44 percent). On election night, Stockman quickly conceded and called upon Texas Republicans to vote the straight party ticket on November 4, 2014.

Meanwhile, Brian Babin won the seat for District 36 as Stockman did not contest this seat.

==Criminal case==
In March 2017, Stockman was arrested for allegedly conspiring to use contributions designated for a charity to fund his campaign and for personal use, a felony, under .

According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in January 2013, Stockman requested and received $350,000 in donations from an unidentified businessman. Stockman allegedly solicited the money by using the name of Life Without Limits, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit intended to help people who have experienced traumatic events. The donation was allegedly intended to be used to renovate the Freedom House in Washington D.C.

Stockman was also charged with conspiracy to falsify statements when reporting contributions to try to launder the money.

The FBI alleged that at the time of the events in question, Stockman had no formal control of the Life Without Limits organization, but that he had opened multiple bank accounts under the name &quot;Stephen E Stockman dba Life Without Limits.&quot; The FBI also alleged that financial records indicate that Stockman &quot;made no significant expenditures toward the purchase, renovation, or operation of the &#x27;Freedom House,&#x27; which was never opened.&quot;

Stockman conspired with Thomas Dodd, a former campaign worker and congressional special assistant. According to the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, the alleged conspiracy involved attempts &quot;to bilk conservative foundations out of at least $775,000 in donations meant for charitable purposes or voter education&quot;. Dodd was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Houston and, on March 20, 2017, he pleaded guilty. Dodd was sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay a fine of $800,000.

Stockman staffer Jason Posey entered a guilty plea before Chief U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal to counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering. He faced a prison term of up to 45 years and a fine of more than $4.8 million, plus hundreds of thousands more in restitution. Posey admitted that at Stockman&#x27;s direction he and Dodd illegally funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from charitable foundations and individuals in charge of the foundations to pay for Stockman&#x27;s campaigns and personal expenses. On April 2, 2019, Posey was sentenced to 18 months and ordered to pay a fine of $720,000.

On March 28, 2017, a federal grand jury issued a 28 count indictment that included 24 counts against Stockman. He was accused of obtaining $1.25 million under false pretenses and using the funds for his political campaigns. He was charged with eleven counts of money laundering, eight counts of mail and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to make &quot;conduit contributions&quot; and false statements (conspiracy to conceal the real source of the contributions by false attribution), two counts of making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, one count of making excessive contributions, and one count of willfully filing a false 2013 Federal income tax return by not reporting some of his income. Posey was charged with money laundering, mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to make conduit contributions and false statements, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission, making excessive contributions, and falsification of records. Due to its complexity and the need for time to review 142,378 pages of documents disclosed by the prosecution, a motion for postponement of Stockman&#x27;s trial by his court-appointed attorney was granted. His trial began on January 29, 2018.

On April 12, 2018, Stockman was convicted by a jury on 23 of the 24 felony counts against him, for which he faced up to 20 years in prison for each count. He was acquitted on one count of wire fraud. Because he was judged to be a flight risk, he was remanded into custody pending sentencing, which was re-set for November 7, 2018.

On November 7, 2018, he was sentenced to serve ten years in prison and ordered to pay $1,014,718.51 in restitution, to be followed by three years of supervised release. Stockman served his sentence at the low-security federal prison in Beaumont, Texas.

On December 22, 2020, Stockman&#x27;s sentence was commuted by President Donald Trump and he was released from the Beaumont facility, serving only two years of his ten-year sentence. According to the White House, he will remain subject to a period of supervised release and an order requiring that he pay more than $1,000,000 in restitution.

<text>Drunken Tiger () was a Korean hip hop group that debuted in 1999 and has since released several albums and won numerous awards. They are known as pioneers of Korean hip-hop who helped bring the genre into the mainstream.

The group&#x27;s original line-up consisted of central member Tiger JK, as well as DJ Shine. Micki Eyes, DJ Jhig, and Roscoe Umali later joined the group. In 2013, Tiger JK moved away from making music under the group&#x27;s original name and formed MFBTY with his wife Yoon Mi-Rae and Bizzy. In 2018, Tiger JK released a final self titled album under the Drunken Tiger name, featuring Yoon Mi-Rae and Bizzy alongside a number of other artists.

==History==

===1998-2000: Debut and early controversy===

In 1998, Korean-American rappers Tiger JK and DJ Shine teamed up to form Drunken Tiger. They released their first album, &quot;Year of the Tiger&quot; in Korea in 1999. At the time, the album was controversial given its explicit lyrics and rejection of mainstream K-pop norms. Unlike their K-pop counterparts, Drunken Tiger wrote their own lyrics, expressed anti-establishment views, and did not perform choreography. However, the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Do You Know Hip-hop,&quot; are now considered Korean hip hop classics.

===2000-2004: Drug charges and early success===

In 2000, Drunken Tiger released their second album, &quot;The Great Rebirth&quot;, and introduced new members DJ Jhig, Micki Eyes, and Roscoe Umali. The album did well on music charts and established the group as &quot;the first commercially successful true hip hop group&quot; in Korea.

However, in the midst of the group&#x27;s success, Tiger JK was arrested for using methamphetamine in Korea in 1999. Tiger JK said that, though he had used drugs in the past, he had not used them in Korea, and he said that he was ultimately found guilty due to false testimony from the members of the hip hop group Uptown, who has also been arrested on drug charges. Tiger JK spent a month and a half in jail and was sentenced to two years probation. As a result, Drunken Tiger was banned from performing on public media for two years. However, after appealing the decision, the ban was lifted, allowing the group to release their third album in 2001.

2001&#x27;s &quot;The Legend Of...,&quot; is one of Drunken Tiger&#x27;s most successful albums. Their single &quot;Good Life&quot; became a huge hit, topping Korean music charts for weeks. They went on to win Best Hip Hop Performance at the 2001 MNET Music Video Festival and the Hip-Hop/Rap Award at the 2001 Seoul Music Awards.

The group released the albums &quot;Foundation&quot; and &quot;One Is Not A Lonely Word&quot; in 2003 and 2004, respectively. By this point, Drunken Tiger&#x27;s appeal had grown internationally, with the group gaining fans and performing in countries including Japan, China, and Taiwan.

===2005-2012: Departure of DJ Shine and continued success===

In 2005, during the debut of the group&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;1945 Liberation&quot;, founding member DJ Shine announced he would leave Drunken Tiger. Tiger JK continued using the group&#x27;s name as a solo artist, and, with the success of the fifth album, signed endorsement deals with Hite Beer and Reebok. In 2006, Tiger JK established his own hip-hop label, Jungle Entertainment, which became the new home of Drunken Tiger.

The release of Drunken Tiger&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Sky Is The Limit&quot;, marked another high point in Drunken Tiger&#x27;s career. Although Tiger JK&#x27;s ability to perform was inhibited by his recently diagnosed acute transverse myelitis, the album&#x27;s single &quot;8:45 Heaven,&quot; a tribute to his late grandmother, became a fan favorite and won Best Hip Hop Song at the 2008 Korean Music Awards.

Drunken Tiger released its eighth album, &quot;Feel gHood Muzik&quot;, in 2009. The double-disc album featured American hip-hop legend, Rakim, as well as Roscoe Umali, who had not appeared on the last few Drunken Tiger releases. The album sold over 100,000 copies, and all 27 tracks debuted on the Top 100 K-Pop Singles chart. The album ultimately won Record of the Year at the 2010 Seoul Music Awards and Best Hip Hop Album at the 2010 Korean Music Awards. Drunken Tiger released the song, Doo Doo Doo Wap Ba Balu, in 2011 featuring the top 13 contestants of Korea&#x27;s Next Top Model (season 2).

===2013-present: Forming MFBTY and Feel Ghood Music===

In 2013, Tiger JK and label mates Yoon Mi-rae and Bizzy released the song, &quot;Sweet Dream,&quot; under the group name MFBTY. An acronym for &quot;My Fans [are] Better Than Yours,&quot; the name MFBTY started as a joke between Tiger JK and fans on Twitter. Although the name was meant to be temporary, the three artists have made subsequent releases as MFBTY, as well as under their solo names. 

Later that year, the three artists left Tiger JK&#x27;s own Jungle Entertainment and signed to his new label, Feel Ghood Music. In September, they released the album &quot;The Cure&quot;, under the name Drunken Tiger ft. Yoon MiRae and Bizzy. The album, which peaked at #6 on the K-Pop Hot 100 chart, was a tribute to Tiger JK&#x27;s father, who was battling cancer at the time.

In 2015, MFBTY released the album &quot;Wondaland&quot;, which was an immediate success. Hours after its release, 17 of the top 20 songs on Daum&#x27;s music chart were from &quot;Wondaland.&quot; The album ultimately reached #8 on Billboard&#x27;s World Albums chart. Tiger JK said the reason he wasn&#x27;t making music under the name Drunken Tiger anymore was because his young son did not like the word &quot;drunken.&quot; In 2018, Tiger JK released a final self titled album under the Drunken Tiger name, featuring Yoon Mi-Rae and Bizzy, as well as other artists including Dok2, Eun Ji-won, RM, and Junoflo.

<text>Sean John is a privately held fashion lifestyle company created by music mogul Sean &quot;Diddy&quot; Combs. The line made its fashion debut with a men&#x27;s sportswear collection for the spring 1998 season.

In 2016, the brand had annual retail sales of $450 million.

==History==

In 1998 Sean Combs launched a signature collection of sportswear under his given name, Sean John. The brand made its debut at retail during a launch event at Bloomingdale&#x27;s in New York City. Since its launch, Sean John has enjoyed critical and commercial success with revenues now exceeding $525 million annually. Sean John has often appeared at the award ceremony for the CFDA Fashion Awards held annually in New York. For five consecutive years, from 2000 to 2005, Sean John was nominated for its excellence in design. In 2004, Sean John was awarded the CFDA Men&#x27;s Designer of the Year award.

In February 2001, Sean John produced the first nationally televised runway show during New York Fashion Week when it simultaneously aired live on E! Television and the Style Network. During fashion week in February 2002, the New York Times ran a front page story on Sean John.

In 2004, Sean John invested in the high-end label Zac Posen.

In October 2008, the company purchased streetwear lifestyle brand Enyce from Liz Claiborne for $20 million.

Combs&#x27; FIFI Award-winning perfume, Unforgivable, was joined by Sean John fragrance I AM KING in November 2008.

In May 2010, Sean John made a distribution agreement with Macy&#x27;s department store in which Macy&#x27;s and Macys.com would be the sole distributor of Sean John sportswear at the retail and online level. As part of this agreement, Sean John and Macy&#x27;s expanded the Sean John brand&#x27;s distribution to many more Macy&#x27;s stores and entered into exclusive marketing partnerships with the NBA. In November 2023, it was announced that Macy&#x27;s was pulling all Sean John clothing from their department and online stores, due to Combs&#x27; sexual assault allegations, effectively ending their partnership with Combs. 

After having previously sold a 90% stake in Sean John to Global Brands Group in 2016, in December 2021, Sean Combs purchased Sean John back from Global Brands Group for $7.5 million, following the company&#x27;s bankruptcy.

<doc id="945631" wikidata="Q673420" url="?curid=945631" title="Concrete Blonde">
<text>Concrete Blonde was an American rock band from Hollywood, California. They were active from 1982 to 1994 and reunited twice: first from 2001 to 2004, then from 2010 to 2012. They were best known for their album &quot;Bloodletting&quot; (1990), its top-20 single &quot;Joey,&quot; and Johnette Napolitano&#x27;s distinctive vocal style.

==Career==
Singer-songwriter and bassist Johnette Napolitano first formed a group with former Sparks bassist James Mankey on guitar in Los Angeles in 1982. Their first recording was the song &quot;Heart Attack,&quot; released under the band name Dreamers on the compilation album &quot;The D.I.Y. Album&quot; (1982). The track was co-produced by James and his brother Earle Mankey, who also programmed the drums. Joined by drummer Michael Murphy, they became Dream 6 and released an eponymous extended play on the independent label Happy Hermit in 1983 (released in France in 1985 by Madrigal). When they signed with I.R.S. Records in 1986, their labelmate Michael Stipe suggested the name Concrete Blonde, describing the contrast between their hard rock music and introspective lyrics. They were joined by drummer Harry Rushakoff on their eponymous debut album.

Their first release was &quot;Concrete Blonde&quot; (1986), which included their debut single &quot;Still in Hollywood.&quot; They added a full-time bass guitarist, Alan Bloch, for their album &quot;Free&quot; (1989), allowing Napolitano to focus on her singing without the burden of playing bass simultaneously. This album included the college radio hit &quot;God Is a Bullet.&quot; 

Their third album, &quot;Bloodletting&quot; (1990), became their most commercially successful, reaching #4 in Canada, #8 in Australia, and #49 in the United States. It was certified gold in both the United States and Australia. Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson replaced Rushakoff on &quot;Bloodletting&quot; while Rushakoff was in treatment for drug addiction. Napolitano also reassumed bass duties for the recording, and Bloch does not appear on the album or any subsequent releases. The album was certified gold by the RIAA and included their highest-charting single, &quot;Joey,&quot; which spent 21 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 chart, peaking at #19 in the United States and #2 in Australia.

&quot;Walking in London&quot; (1992) saw the return of original drummer Rushakoff due to Thompson&#x27;s immigration issues, while its successor, &quot;Mexican Moon&quot; (1993), featured the &quot;Bloodletting&quot; lineup with Thompson back on drums. Neither album achieved the commercial success of &quot;Bloodletting,&quot; and Napolitano disbanded the group in 1994. 

The band reunited in 1997, with Napolitano and Mankey collaborating with the band Los Illegals on the album &quot;Concrete Blonde y Los Illegals&quot;. The vocals were primarily in Spanish. During live performances, the band altered the refrain of &quot;Still in Hollywood&quot; to &quot;Still in the Barrio&quot; and included covers of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;. 

The band reunited once more in 2001 and released the album &quot;Group Therapy&quot; (2002). The album was recorded in 10 days and featured Rushakoff again on drums. However, Rushakoff was eventually dismissed from the band for repeatedly failing to appear at scheduled performances. Initially replaced on tour by lighting technician Mike Devitt, he was later replaced permanently by Gabriel Ramirez. The album &quot;Mojave&quot; followed in 2004.

===Timeline===
== Retirement and post-retirement ==
On June 5, 2006, Napolitano announced that the band had officially retired. A message on the Concrete Blonde website read: &quot;Thanks to everyone who heard and believed in the music. Music lives on. Keep listening, keep believing, keep dreaming. Like a ripple, the music moves and travels and finds you. Drive to the music, make love to the music, cry to the music. That&#x27;s why we made it. Long after we&#x27;re gone, the music will still be there. Thanks to everyone who helped us bring the music to you &amp; thanks to every face and every heart in every audience all over the world.&quot; 

On July 13, 2010, Shout! Factory released a remastered 20th-anniversary edition of &quot;Bloodletting&quot;. It featured six bonus tracks: &quot;I Want You,&quot; &quot;Little Wing,&quot; the French extended version of &quot;Bloodletting (The Vampire Song),&quot; and live versions of &quot;Roses Grow,&quot; &quot;The Sky Is a Poisonous Garden,&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow, Wendy.&quot; An error in the packaging of the re-release included early non-album period photos featuring original drummer Harry Rushakoff, who had been replaced the night before the first studio session for &quot;Bloodletting&quot; by Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson. The band supported the reissue with the &quot;20 Years of Bloodletting: The Vampires Rise&quot; tour, which continued through the remainder of the year. 

In 2012, the band released the single &quot;Rosalie,&quot; with the B-side &quot;I Know the Ghost.&quot; In December of that year, they embarked on a brief tour of nine cities, primarily along the East Coast of the United States.

Former basketball player, 1976 Olympic silver medalist, and assistant coach Blagoja Georgievski was appointed by the committee to carry the Macedonian flag in the opening ceremony.

Macedonia left Athens without receiving a single Olympic medal for the first time since the nation made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

<text>linux.conf.au (often abbreviated as lca or LCA) is Australasia&#x27;s regional Linux and open source conference. It is a roaming conference, held in a different Australian or New Zealand city every year, coordinated by Linux Australia and organised by local volunteers.

The conference is a non-profit event, with any surplus funds being used to seed the following year&#x27;s conference and to support the Australian Linux and open source communities. The name is the conference&#x27;s URL, using the uncommon second-level domain .conf.au.

Although several online events were ran post-COVID, since 2023 Linux Australia has instead auspiced Everything Open. This is a shorter three-day conference that follows a similar format - but without the additional two days of Miniconfs.

==Conference history==
In 1999, Linux kernel hacker Rusty Russell organised the Conference of Australian Linux Users in Melbourne. The first conference held under the linux.conf.au name was held two years later in 
Sydney. The conference is generally held in a different Australian city each time; although from 2006 onward, New Zealand cities have also been hosts. 

Highlights from past conferences include:

* 1999: CALU (Conference of Australian Linux Users) was conceived, bankrolled (via his personal credit card) and executed by Linux kernel hacker Rusty Russell. It laid the foundation for a successful, strongly technical, eclectic and fun conference series.

* 2001: the first conference held under the linux.conf.au name.

* 2004: a major highlight was the dunking of Linus Torvalds for charity.

* 2006: the first conference to be held outside Australia, recognising the importance of the New Zealand Linux community.

* 2007: a new feature was an Open Day for non-conference attendees, in which community groups, interest groups and Linux businesses held stands and demonstrations.

* 2008: the second time the conference was held in Melbourne. 100 OLPC machines were distributed to random attendees to encourage development. The Speakers dinner was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral Chapter House, and the Penguin Dinner was held in conjunction with Melbourne&#x27;s Night Market, playing on the title of Eric Raymond&#x27;s book, The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

* 2009: during the Penguin Dinner, a substantial sum of money was raised for the Save Tasmanian Devils fund – and a pledge made to replace the Tux Logo with the conference mascot, Tuz, to help raise awareness.

* 2010: over $33,000 raised for Wellington Lifeflight Helicopter Ambulance service.

* 2011: the event was almost washed out by the floods that devastated southern Queensland. 

* 2016: preparations almost derailed by a massive storm just before the conference opened.

*2020: $24,342 raised and donated to Red Cross for Australian Bush-fire relief

* 2021: in May 2020 Linux Australia announced that the planned 2021 conference in Canberra was postponed until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a lightweight virtual conference would be held in 2021 instead.

== Miniconfs ==
Since 2002, a key feature of the conference are the associated &quot;miniconfs&quot;. These are half – 2 days streamed gatherings run before the main conference. They have their own programme, but are open for any conference attendee to participate in. 

The first event to have a miniconf was in 2002, with the Debian Miniconf, organised by James Bromberger. This was based upon the idea that DebConf 1 in Bordeaux was a &quot;mini-conf&quot; of the French Libre Software Meeting. The concept grew in 2004, with the Open-Source in Government (ossig) miniconf, EducationaLinux, Debian Miniconf and GNOME.conf.au. In 2010 the Arduino Miniconf was introduced by Jonathan Oxer, the author of Practical Arduino.

Miniconfs have included those devoted to computer programming, education, security, multimedia, arduino and system administration.

<text>Mikko Henrikki Eloranta (born 24 August 1972) is a Finnish former ice hockey player who played with TPS Turku of the SM-Liiga. He represented Finland in both the Olympic Winter Games and the World Cup of Hockey.

==Playing career==
Eloranta was drafted 247th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. He played for Boston for two seasons before he was traded by the Bruins, along with Jason Allison, to the Los Angeles Kings for Jozef Stumpel and Glen Murray on 24 October 2001.

<doc id="945646" wikidata="Q323178" url="?curid=945646" title="Above the Law (group)">
<text>Above the Law was an American hip hop group from Pomona, California, founded in 1989 by Cold 187um, Lay Law, KMG the Illustrator, Go Mack, and DJ Total K-Oss.

==Biography==
In 1989, the group signed with Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records. While there, the group became an additional influence in pioneering with N.W.A. Their first album on Ruthless, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; Like Hustlers&quot;, featured a guest appearance from N.W.A and production from Dr. Dre. Above the Law member Cold 187um worked closely with Dre on production, and the two greatly influenced each other. The songs &quot;Murder Rap&quot; and &quot;Untouchable&quot; became minor hits from the album. &quot;Murder Rap&quot; appeared in the 2008 film &quot;Pineapple Express&quot;. The song &quot;Freedom of Speech&quot; was featured in the 1990 movie &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; and its soundtrack album. In September 1990, members of Above the Law clashed with Ice Cube and his posse, Da Lench Mob, during the annual New Music Seminar conference.

The group&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Livin&#x27; Like Hustlers&quot;, was released in 1990. This album, which came out before Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;, featured a similar G-Funk sound. Cold 187um has claimed that he was the first to pioneer the G-Funk style and that Dr. Dre&#x27;s new sound was largely inspired by his work on that album. In 1994, the group released &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s Curse&quot;, their last album on Ruthless Records. It included the minor hit &quot;Black Superman&quot;.

Shortly after Eazy-E&#x27;s death, the group signed with Tommy Boy Records in 1996. There, they released &quot;Time Will Reveal&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Legends&quot; in 1999. In the same year, the group signed with Suge Knight&#x27;s Death Row Records, but they left the label in 2002. Above the Law was also part of the West Coast Rap All-Stars, contributing to &quot;We&#x27;re All in the Same Gang,&quot; a 1990 collaboration of West Coast hip-hop artists promoting an anti-violence message.

On the morning of July 7, 2012, multiple sources confirmed that emcee KMG the Illustrator had died. Longtime Above the Law affiliate Kokane announced the rapper&#x27;s death on his Twitter account the same day. While the cause of death remains officially unknown, Big Hutch stated that he died of a heart attack while taking a shower. He was 43 years old.

Four of the group&#x27;s most popular music videos, &quot;Black Superman,&quot; &quot;Call It What U Want&quot; featuring 2Pac, &quot;V.S.O.P.,&quot; and the long-form music video &quot;V.S.O.P. REMIX&quot; were written and directed by Marty Thomas, Eazy-E&#x27;s longtime Ruthless Records film director. Thomas also wrote and directed the controversial and ultimately banned &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s Curse&quot; album television commercials. These commercials featured disturbing imagery, including the KKK chasing Above the Law past a church with burning torches and a white &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; pulling a newborn African-American baby from its mother&#x27;s arms. The commercial won several prestigious international awards.

According to Kokane, a new Above the Law album was recorded before KMG&#x27;s death. Cold 187um has stated that over 30 unreleased tracks were recorded while KMG was still alive, with the rumored title &quot;Victims of Global Politics.&quot; However, no release date has been announced.

Above the Law claims to have invented the &quot;G-funk&quot; sound, which was later popularized by Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;.

<doc id="945652" wikidata="Q3430698" url="?curid=945652" title="Richard Dearlove">
<text>Sir Richard Billing Dearlove (born 23 January 1945) is a retired British intelligence officer who was head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), a role known informally as &quot;C&quot;, from 1999 until 6 May 2004. He was head of MI6 during the invasion of Iraq. He was criticised by the Iraq Inquiry for providing unverified intelligence about weapons of mass destruction to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.

He is currently Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the University of London. He was previously Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge from 2004 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Dearlove was born at Gorran Haven, Cornwall, the son of Jack Dearlove, a 1948 Olympic silver medallist in rowing. He received his early formal education at Monkton Combe School near Bath, Somerset, and the Kent School in Kent, Connecticut. He graduated from Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, with a Master of Arts degree in history.

==Career==
===HM&#x27;s civil service===
Dearlove joined MI6 in 1966 and was posted to Nairobi in 1968. In 1984, he was appointed an OBE. After being posted to Prague, Paris and Geneva, he became head of Washington station in 1991, director of personnel and administration in 1993 and director of operations in 1994. Dearlove was appointed chief of MI6 in 1999, by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, following David Spedding&#x27;s August 1999 retirement from the position. Dearlove facilitated publication of the Mitrokhin Archive, under Project Jessant. In 2001, he was appointed Knight Commander of Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG).

His tenure as head of MI6 saw many events for the Service as well as tension with the Government over the evidence for war on Iraq. It has been suggested that many within the intelligence community were uneasy that their qualified judgements on Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction were presented as hard facts in various dossiers (e.g. September Dossier &amp; The Dodgy Dossier aka Iraq Dossier). In July 2002, Dearlove privately told ministers that in the US &quot;intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy&quot;.

The official Chilcot Report published in 2016 criticised Dearlove for presenting so-called &quot;hot&quot; intelligence about alleged weapons of mass destruction provided by an Iraqi with &quot;phenomenal access&quot; to high levels in the Iraqi government directly to Prime Minister, Tony Blair, without first confirming its accuracy. The investigators found that references to this intelligence in government reports were over-certain and did not adequately stress uncertainties and nuance. The informant was later found to have been lying. The Chilcot report stated that &quot;personal intervention [by Dearlove] and its urgency gave added weight to a report that had not been properly evaluated and would have coloured the perception of ministers and senior officials&quot;. The day after the report was published, Blair conceded that he should have challenged such intelligence reports before relying on them to justify military action in Iraq.

===University administrator===
Dearlove was elected Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 1 August 2004. He accepted an invitation to become the Chairman of Trustees of the Cambridge Union Society in 2006. As Master of Pembroke, Dearlove was &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the board of Trustees of Pembroke House, a community centre in Walworth, London, via the college&#x27;s patronage of the advowson of St Christopher&#x27;s, Walworth (CofE). He is to this day the President of Pembroke College Boat Club.

In February 2008, Dearlove gave evidence at the inquest of Princess Diana&#x27;s death, responding to Harrods owner Mohamed al-Fayed who said that MI6 had murdered Diana.

Dearlove is a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society principles. He is also a &quot;senior advisor&quot; to the Monitor Group – a consultancy and private equity firm which has been implicated in undertaking PR work for Libya and Muammar Gaddafi. In April 2013, it was announced that Dearlove joined the advisory board of Ergo, an intelligence and advisory firm.

On 15 February 2011, Dearlove gave a talk at the Cambridge Union Society, taking as his theme the question of how much secrecy the UK needs: &quot;The short answer to that question is that it needs some but actually not as much as you think.&quot; He said he &quot;would definitely draw a parallel at the moment between the wave of political unrest which is sweeping through the Middle East, in a very excited and rather extraordinary fashion, and also the Wikileaks phenomenon&quot;, but added later, in connection with the way technological advances was altering the norms of civic and private life, commenting on WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, that &quot;the Assange story, as such, is ultimately a distraction. He&#x27;s a very undignified flag-carrier, in my opinion, for a very important issue.&quot;

In 2012, Dearlove took a sabbatical from Cambridge University to write an account of events leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq from his perspective at MI6, including coverage of the production of the so-called &quot;dodgy dossier&quot;. Publishing such an account would be unprecedented for a former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service. He may release this now that the Chilcot Inquiry findings have been published in 2016.

On 7 July 2014, in a lecture at the Royal United Services Institute, Dearlove argued that the government and media had exaggerated the Islamist terrorism threat to the UK, giving extremists publicity counter-productive to UK interests.

In 2015, Dearlove retired as Master of Pembroke College. He is non-executive chairman of Crossword Cybersecurity plc.

===Political views===
On 16 May 2016, Dearlove gave a public lecture televised by the BBC on contemporary mass foreign migration and its effects upon the European continent. In its text he stated that the governments of Europe were facing a &quot;sea change&quot; in their politics, and if they did not get control and prevent ongoing mass migration of peoples from Africa and Asia into Europe they would find themselves &quot;at the mercy of a populist uprising, ... which is already stirring,&quot; and that the oncoming 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum was the first manifestation of it. He stated further that foreign mass migration&#x27;s geopolitical impact upon Europe, if it was not prevented, was set to reshape its political landscape as those of its citizens who feel their interests are threatened asserted their influence.

On 8 June 2017, Dearlove intervened on the day of the 2017 UK general election in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; saying &quot;how profoundly dangerous it would be for the nation if Jeremy Corbyn becomes Prime Minister.&quot;

On 29 November 2018 Dearlove co-signed an open letter, published in a British national newspaper, condemning Prime Minister Theresa May&#x27;s negotiated Brexit withdrawal agreement after the 2016 Referendum on the issue, as the matter was passing through the House of Commons to be voted upon. In its text he stated that the Withdrawal Agreement as negotiated undermined MI6&#x27;s nationally independent global intelligence power. In a published response, dated the same day, May&#x27;s office issued a public rebuttal to the letter&#x27;s content, singling out Dearlove personally from the named list of several signatories to the open letter, and stating that the Withdrawal Agreement &quot;absolutely does not&quot; compromise the national independence of the UK&#x27;s intelligence capacity. In early December 2018 Dearlove, in a jointly authored text with Major-General Julian Thompson, published on the website &#x27;Briefings for Brexit&#x27; an extensive reply to May&#x27;s statement entitled &#x27;The Prime Minister is misleading the country on defence and security&#x27;, citing a &#x27;worryingly poor understanding of the issues&#x27; by her office.

On 8 January 2019, Dearlove sent a letter co-signed by Field Marshal Lord Guthrie to all Chairs of Conservative Party Parliamentary Constituency Associations with sitting Members of Parliament stating that the passage through the House of Commons of the Brexit withdrawal agreement contained decisions which fundamentally undermined the integrity of the Defence of the Realm, and requested that they take measures to discourage their parliamentary representatives from voting for it in the Commons. The letter as an alternative advocated the case upon national security grounds that the United Kingdom should fully withdraw from the European Union without an Intergovernmental relationship between the two persisting after the process.

On 16 May 2019 Dearlove characterised Huawei&#x27;s role in the British 5G network as &quot;an unnecessary risk&quot; as it could give the Chinese government a &quot;potentially advantageous exploitative position&quot;. On 17 January 2020, as U.S. President Donald Trump was held to be bluffing by the EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan over the incompatibility of Five Eyes and Huawei, Dearlove said Huawei posed a security threat &quot;without question... It’s a capability in the bank that China will use if it needs to... If the Chinese state says to Huawei &#x27;jump&#x27; the company can’t turn round and say &#x27;no&#x27;.&quot;

On 3 June 2020 Dearlove stated in a podcast interview that the Coronavirus disease 2019 began &#x27;as an accident&#x27; either in the Wuhan Institute of Virology lab or in the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control.

<doc id="945655" wikidata="Q1322897" url="?curid=945655" title="Brazilian Social Democracy Party">
<text>The Brazilian Social Democracy Party (, PSDB), also known as the Brazilian Social Democratic Party or the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy, is a centre-right political party in Brazil. As the formerly third largest party in the National Congress, the PSDB was the main opposition party against the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) administrations of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff from 2003 to 2016.

Born together as part of the social democratic opposition to the military dictatorship from the late 1970s through the 1980s, and later shifting toward neoliberalism and liberal conservatism in the 1990s, the PSDB and the PT have since the mid-1990s been the bitterest of rivals in current Brazilian politics—both parties prohibit any kind of coalition or official cooperation with each other at any government levels. The PSDB&#x27;s mascot is a blue and yellow colored toucan, with party members being called &quot;tucanos&quot; for this reason. Famous &quot;tucanos&quot; include Mário Covas, Geraldo Alckmin, Tasso Jereissati, Aécio Neves, former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Franco Montoro, Aloysio Nunes, Yeda Crusius, João Doria, and José Serra.

== History ==
With the imminent collapse of the military dictatorship in the early 1980s, a group of left-wing intellectuals were mobilized to create a leftist party. Some of them attempted to work with the labour movement led by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, but the group split over ideological grounds. A group of democratic socialists and Trotskyists joined the labour movement and founded the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) while the social democrats remained in the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and would later create the Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Founded on 25 June 1988 by members of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) linked to the European social democratic movement as an attempt to clarify their ideals, its manifesto preached &quot;democracy as a fundamental value&quot; and &quot;social justice as an aim to be reached&quot;. In its foundation, the party attempted to unite political groups as diverse as social democrats, social liberals, Christian democrats and democratic socialists. The period when the PSDB was created was a very significant moment in the history of Brazilian politics.

On 21 April 1985, President-elect Tancredo Neves died, having been the last President not elected directly by the people since the beginning of the military dictatorship. With the formation of new parties, including the PSDB, a National Constitutional Assembly was created and drafted the current democratic constitution in 1988. A high proportion of the first members of the PSDB came from the so-called &quot;historic PMDB&quot;, which was and still is a very large party with many internal conflicts. The founders of the PSDB were dissatisfied with the results of the National Constitutional Assembly and decided to create a party to reflect the need for a national political renewal. As their manifesto states, the new party was created &quot;away from the official benefits, but close to the pulsing of the streets&quot; (taken from a speech by party leader Franco Montoro). Some of the founding members were José Serra, Mário Covas, Ciro Gomes, André Franco Montoro, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Aécio Neves and Geraldo Alckmin.

In a country where two constitutional referendums, held in 1963 and in 1993, have shown a very strong preference for a presidential system of government as in most countries of the Americas, the PSDB stands almost alone in the preference given in its manifesto to a parliamentarian system of government. However, after the electors rejected parliamentarism in 1993 and even though the PSDB leader Cardoso was elected president the next year, the party did nothing in subsequent years to further the cause of a parliamentarian system.The PSDB is one of the largest and most significant political parties in Brazil. Its official program says its policies are social democratic and often associated with the Third Way movement, although the party is also seen as influenced by neoliberalism. The party&#x27;s program states that it &quot;reject[s] populism and authoritarianism, as well as both fundamentalist neoliberalism and obsolete national-statism&quot;.

Despite its name, the PSDB is not a member of the Socialist International which draws together social democratic parties worldwide (the Brazilian member of the Socialist International is the Democratic Labour Party, PDT). The party has never had the links to trade union movements that usually characterize social democratic parties; it used to sponsor a central union, the Social-Democracia Sindical (SDS), which has now merged with the Central Autônoma dos Trabalhadores (CAT) and the much more important Central Geral dos Trabalhadores (CGT) into the União Geral dos Trabalhadores (UGT), but its impact among the unions has always been quite unimpressive compared to even much smaller parties as the PDT or the Communist Party of Brazil, or to the &quot;tucanos&quot;″s own influence in society at large.
After supporting the candidacy of Geraldo Alckmin in the 2018 presidential election (which was eliminated in the first round with 4.8 per cent of the vote), in the second round, some of the party&#x27;s leaders supported the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, to whom most of the party&#x27;s traditional electorate had already turned, while former São Paulo Governor Alberto Goldman endorsed Workers’ Party candidate Fernando Haddad instead.

=== Recent times ===

A mere six years after its creation, the PSDB won the presidency. It grew faster than any other party in Brazilian history, with an astonishingly good performance in elections at all levels. President Cardoso enjoyed eight years (1994–2002) of political stability in his tenure as president, with achievement toward these tenets of PSDB&#x27;s stated program:
* Constant defense of democracy
* Keeping the state at a minimally needed size
* Administrative decentralization
* Sustainable economic growth with wealth distribution
* Political reform to make stronger parties with electoral district representatives more accountable as well as aiming to reduce and eliminate corruption
After suffering defeats in the 2016 and 2018 elections, PSDB went through a rebranding. The font of their logo was changed, the Toucan was removed in favor of a flag of Brazil and the party received a new motto &quot;Pelo Brasil&quot; (&quot;For Brazil&quot;). However, after heavy losses in the 2022 Brazilian general election, especially with the loss of their longtime hegemony in São Paulo, the party&#x27;s principles were revised and the Toucan logo was reinstated under Eduardo Leite&#x27;s leadership, alongside a new motto, &quot;Um só Brasil&quot; (&quot;Only one Brazil&quot;).

== Controversies ==
=== Ranking of corruption ===
Based on data released by the Superior Electoral Court, the Movement to Combat Electoral Corruption released a ranking on 4 October 2007 regarding the parties that included the largest number of elected officials exposed for corruption since 2000. The PSDB appeared in third place on the list with 58 cases, behind only the Democrats and the PMDB.

The PSDB was considered Brazil&#x27;s &quot;dirtiest&quot; party by the country&#x27;s electoral authority. Yet, according to a 2016 academic study, the party has clearly benefited from the complacency of the Brazilian media, which has barely mentioned these cases.

According to an analysis released on 8 September 2012, of 317 Brazilian politicians who were barred from running in elections by the Clean Record Act, the PSDB is the party that has the largest number of barred candidates with 56 party members.

=== &quot;A Privataria Tucana&quot; ===
The 2011 book &quot;A Privataria Tucana&quot;, written by journalist Amaury Ribeiro Jr., a former special reporter of weekly magazine &quot;ISTO É&quot; and daily newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;, highlighted documents that show alleged irregularities in privatizations that occurred during the administration of the former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. It contains about 140 pages of photocopied documents in support of the claim that President Cardoso&#x27;s Minister of Planning and later Minister of Health José Serra received kickbacks from businessmen who participated in the Brazilian privatization process, held companies in tax shelters, and moved millions of dollars between 1993 and 2003.

== Ideology ==
Although the PSDB declares itself as a centrist party, some people on the left reject this definition, especially after Fernando Henrique Cardoso embraced Third Way politics as president. The party has been seen as neoliberal by critics from its beginnings. Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, one of the founders of the PSDB, left the party in 2011 for ideological reasons, claiming &quot;that the party had taken a hard turn to the right&quot;.

Since abandoning its more leftist positions, the party has been described as centrist, centre-right and right-wing.

In an article titled &quot;The left-right confusion in the post-Berlin Wall world&quot;, political analyst Angelo Segrillo says that &quot;most analysts defined PSDB as center-left as of its foundation, after all, it was the Brazilian Social Democratic Party&quot;. As he notes, &quot;this story changed after 1994, with the election of PSDB to the presidency. [...] A rhetoric of overcoming classical ideological division [...] was one of the justifications of the grand parliamentary alliance with center and right-wing parties. [...] As such, after the 1994 presidential election, most analysts started defining PSDB as a center party along with PMDB&quot;. In its 2009 report about Freedom in the World, Freedom House defined the opposition coalition (formed by PSDB, PPS and Democrats) as a &quot;center-right coalition&quot;. However, in the 2010 report by the same organization, PSDB was defined as a &quot;center-left&quot; party.

Political scientist Glauco Peres notes that the party&#x27;s move toward conservatism came &quot;in stages,&quot; from &quot;the liberal policies and major privatizations of the Cardoso era&quot; to the gradual emergence of a &quot;conservative and religious discourse&quot; in the early 2010s to the failed campaign of the party&#x27;s right-wing presidential candidate Aecio Neves in 2014.

Workers&#x27; Party campaign leader Marco Aurélio Garcia criticized declarations made by PSDB president Sérgio Guerra that PSDB is &quot;the real left&quot;. He said that &quot;PSDB is not a right wing party, it is the party &quot;of&quot; the right wing&quot;.

=== Political alignment ===
The PSDB questions the use of what it considers &quot;outdated political labels&quot; such as &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;. To quote a document drafted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso&#x27;s office in 1990: &quot;If left means to be against the existing social order, and right in favor, then social-democracy is without doubt a left current. [...] A social democrat is before anything else someone who has critical sense — who realizes the injustices of society and has no fear to oppose them, even at the risk of being taken as a subversive or a dreamer&quot;.

The party did not preach nationalization or privatization in general (&quot;the consensus is that the state must not be too big or too small, but &#x27;have the size and functions corresponding to the needs of the whole of society&#x27;&quot;), yet President Cardoso privatized many large public companies, such as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and the national telecommunication system. Many political scientists in Brazil believed that the party in its antagonism with the PT made a move to the right in recent years to fill a void in the Brazilian political spectrum and to put a certain distance between itself and the PT&#x27;s political views, which also moved more to the right (from the far-left or left to the centre-left) in the 1990s in order to be elected.

=== Voter base ===
The main electoral base of the party is the State of São Paulo, where the party triumphed in all but three major elections to executive office. The party also has a stronghold in other regions which reject the PT, like Espirito Santo, and in some southern and mid-western states. Unlike the PT, the party has more success in more local elections in the same areas that often vote for the PT in national elections, like the North and Northeastern regions and Minas Gerais. Many leaders of the party come from these regions, like Tasso Jereisatti, Aécio Neves, Teotonio Vilela Filho, Cassio Cunha Lima, Sergio Guerra and Simão Jatene. However, the party has not succeeded in transforming this into results in presidential elections, partly because of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s charisma and partly because of internal infighting.

Most rejection of the party comes from the State of Rio de Janeiro, where the positioning of the party in the Brazilian centre and centre-right often loses to PMDB and another parties with less national representation, like the Brazilian Republican Party, the Democrats, Progressistas and the Social Christian Party. The only victory of the party in Rio occurred in 1994, when the majority of voters in the state supported FHC in the presidential election and the toucans Artur da Tavola and Marcello Alencar were elected to the senate and state governorship, respectively. PT is also strongly rejected in Rio, however less than PSDB.

Despite being considered a centre-left party by their own members, media and by the Brazilian right, the PSDB has little or no appeal to the majority of Brazilian left. The majority of support and bases of &quot;tucanos&quot; comes from right-wing sectors like conservative Christians, professionals, the middle and upper middle class, farmers, landowners and business owners. Reasons for this support derive from the more moderate rhetoric and ideology of the party compared with the PT, the major economic reforms which the party led in the 1990s, and the major influence of the Democrats in the party.

This support is not viewed well inside the &quot;old guard&quot; of the party. Many &quot;tucanos&quot; often publicly express their discomfort with the party. Even Cardoso, the most successful figure in the party&#x27;s history, constantly criticizes such PSDB politicians as Colonel Telhada, a former police officer who was elected a deputy in São Paulo with proposals such as reducing the age of defense of infancy, harsher penalties for criminals and appealing to the evangelical churches, of which Telhada is a member; and João Dória Junior, mayor of São Paulo between 2016 and 2018 and governor of the state of São Paulo since 2019. Dória is often accused of populism, demagoguery, opportunism, personalism, self-promotion, market fundamentalism and aggressive exploitation of anti-Workers&#x27; Party sentiment within the populace. These antagonisms persist between the voter base together with the new members who joined the party based on right-wing sentiment of opposition to the Workers&#x27; Party versus the party elite and older members with more left-liberal, progressive, social democratic and pragmatic views, thus an important factor in the often internal rifts between &quot;tucanos&quot;.

In 2017, a group of new, young federal representatives, nicknamed &quot;black heads&quot;, in reference to their youth (contrasting the gray or bald heads of older and progressive members), began to gain prominence in the party. This wing, made up of members in their 30s or younger, has shown strong opposition to support of the party for the government of President Michel Temer and a far more support for economic liberalism than the old party members like José Serra and Aloysio Nunes. Black heads now occupy important positions inside the party and with support of the base and social movements like the Free Brazil Movement have the capacity to push the party more to the right-wing of the Brazilian political spectrum.

In the 2018 general election, the party suffered the greatest defeat in its history as Geraldo Alckmin came in fourth in the presidential election with less than 5% of votes and the party fell to 10th position in number of representatives in the Chamber of Deputies, with fewer representatives than the Democrats. The key reasons for this failure were the corruption scandals of Aécio Neves, the party&#x27;s support for the government of Michel Temer, the lack of charisma and wrong strategies of Alckmin in the presidential campaign, which chose to attack the right-wing populist candidate Jair Bolsonaro from a progressive viewpoint instead of attacking the traditional rival PT, and a continuing domination of old leftist leaders instead of new and more liberal members with stronger connection with the voter base over the party. They support Bolsonaro and his Social Liberal Party smashed the voter base of the party. The PSDB faced a runoff in three of the four biggest states, namely São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, all of them with more pro-free market and centre-right views than Alckmin. PSDB triumphed in São Paulo with João Doria Junior, Rio Grande do Sul with Eduardo Leite and in the agrarian state of Mato Grosso do Sul with Reinaldo Azambuja, also a centre-right candidate.

According to researcher Christophe Ventura, the party&#x27;s candidates are often evangelicals, multimillionaires and entrepreneurs. They present themselves as &quot;managers&quot; rather than &quot;politicians&quot;.

<text>A free-electron laser (FEL) is a fourth generation light source producing extremely brilliant and short pulses of radiation. An FEL functions much as a laser but employs relativistic electrons as a gain medium instead of using stimulated emission from atomic or molecular excitations. In an FEL, a &quot;bunch&quot; of electrons passes through a magnetic structure called an undulator or wiggler to generate radiation, which re-interacts with the electrons to make them emit coherently, exponentially increasing its intensity. 

As electron kinetic energy and undulator parameters can be adapted as desired, free-electron lasers are tunable and can be built for a wider frequency range than any other type of laser, currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves, through terahertz radiation and infrared, to the visible spectrum, ultraviolet, and X-ray.
The first free-electron laser was developed by John Madey in 1971 at Stanford University using technology developed by Hans Motz and his coworkers, who built an undulator at Stanford in 1953, using the wiggler magnetic configuration. Madey used a 43 MeV electron beam and 5 m long wiggler to amplify a signal.
== Beam creation ==
To create an FEL, an electron gun is used. A beam of electrons is generated by a short laser pulse illuminating a photocathode located inside a microwave cavity and accelerated to almost the speed of light in a device called a photoinjector. The beam is further accelerated to a design energy by a particle accelerator, usually a linear particle accelerator. Then the beam passes through a periodic arrangement of magnets with alternating poles across the beam path, which creates a side to side magnetic field. The direction of the beam is called the longitudinal direction, while the direction across the beam path is called transverse. This array of magnets is called an undulator or a wiggler, because the Lorentz force of the field forces the electrons in the beam to wiggle transversely, traveling along a sinusoidal path about the axis of the undulator.

The transverse acceleration of the electrons across this path results in the release of photons, which are monochromatic but still incoherent, because the electromagnetic waves from randomly distributed electrons interfere constructively and destructively in time. The resulting radiation power scales linearly with the number of electrons. Mirrors at each end of the undulator create an optical cavity, causing the radiation to form standing waves, or alternately an external excitation laser is provided.
The radiation becomes sufficiently strong that the transverse electric field of the radiation beam interacts with the transverse electron current created by the sinusoidal wiggling motion, causing some electrons to gain and others to lose energy to the optical field via the ponderomotive force.

This energy modulation evolves into electron density (current) modulations with a period of one optical wavelength. The electrons are thus longitudinally clumped into &quot;microbunches&quot;, separated by one optical wavelength along the axis. Whereas an undulator alone would cause the electrons to radiate independently (incoherently), the radiation emitted by the bunched electrons is in phase, and the fields add together coherently.

The radiation intensity grows, causing additional microbunching of the electrons, which continue to radiate in phase with each other. This process continues until the electrons are completely microbunched and the radiation reaches a saturated power several orders of magnitude higher than that of the undulator radiation.

The wavelength of the radiation emitted can be readily tuned by adjusting the energy of the electron beam or the magnetic-field strength of the undulators.

FELs are relativistic machines. The wavelength of the emitted radiation, formula_1, is given by

: formula_2

or when the wiggler strength parameter , discussed below, is small

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the undulator wavelength (the spatial period of the magnetic field), formula_5 is the relativistic Lorentz factor and the proportionality constant depends on the undulator geometry and is of the order of 1.

This formula can be understood as a combination of two relativistic effects. Imagine you are sitting on an electron passing through the undulator. Due to Lorentz contraction the undulator is shortened by a formula_5 factor and the electron experiences much shorter undulator wavelength formula_7. However, the radiation emitted at this wavelength is observed in the laboratory frame of reference and the relativistic Doppler effect brings the second formula_5 factor to the above formula. In an X-ray FEL the typical undulator wavelength of 1 cm is transformed to X-ray wavelengths on the order of 1 nm by formula_5 ≈ 2000, i.e. the electrons have to travel with the speed of 0.9999998&quot;c&quot;.

=== Wiggler strength parameter K ===

, a dimensionless parameter, defines the wiggler strength as the relationship between the length of a period and the radius of bend,

: formula_10

where formula_11 is the bending radius, formula_12 is the applied magnetic field, formula_13 is the electron mass, and formula_14 is the elementary charge.

Expressed in practical units, the dimensionless undulator parameter is
formula_15.

=== Quantum effects ===

In most cases, the theory of classical electromagnetism adequately accounts for the behavior of free electron lasers. For sufficiently short wavelengths, quantum effects of electron recoil and shot noise may have to be considered.

== Construction==

Free-electron lasers require the use of an electron accelerator with its associated shielding, as accelerated electrons can be a radiation hazard if not properly contained. These accelerators are typically powered by klystrons, which require a high-voltage supply. The electron beam must be maintained in a vacuum, which requires the use of numerous vacuum pumps along the beam path. While this equipment is bulky and expensive, free-electron lasers can achieve very high peak powers, and the tunability of FELs makes them highly desirable in many disciplines, including chemistry, structure determination of molecules in biology, medical diagnosis, and nondestructive testing.

===Infrared and terahertz FELs===
The Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin completed a mid-infrared and terahertz FEL in 2013.

At Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf two terahertz and mid-infrared FEL-based sources are in operation. FELBE is an FEL equipped with a cavity with continuous pulsing with a repetition rate of 13 MHz, pulsing with 1 kHz by applying a pulse picker, and macrobunch operation with bunch length &gt; 100 μs and macrobunch repetition rates ≤ 25 Hz. Pulse duration and pulse energy vary with wavelength and lie in the range from 1 - 25 ps and 100 nJ - few μJ, respectively. The TELBE facility is based on a superradiant undulator offering THz pulses ranging from 0.1 THz to 2.5 THz at repetition rates up to 500 kHz.

===X-ray FELs===
The lack of mirror materials that can reflect extreme ultraviolet and x-rays means that X-ray free electron lasers (XFEL) need to work without a resonant cavity. Consequently, in an X-ray FEL (XFEL) the beam is produced by a single pass of radiation through the undulator. This requires that there be enough amplification over a single pass to produce an appropriate beam.

Hence, XFELs use long undulator sections that are tens or hundreds of meters long. This allows XFELs to produce the brightest X-ray pulses of any human-made x-ray source. The intense pulses from the X-ray laser lies in the principle of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), which leads to microbunching. Initially all electrons are distributed evenly and emit only incoherent spontaneous radiation. Through the interaction of this radiation and the electrons&#x27; oscillations, they drift into microbunches separated by a distance equal to one radiation wavelength. This interaction drives all electrons to begin emitting coherent radiation. Emitted radiation can reinforce itself perfectly whereby wave crests and wave troughs are optimally superimposed on one another. This results in an exponential increase of emitted radiation power, leading to high beam intensities and laser-like properties. 

Examples of facilities operating on the SASE FEL principle include the:
* Free electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) 
* Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory 
* European x-ray free electron laser (EuXFEL) in Hamburg 
* SPring-8 Compact SASE Source (SCSS) in Japan
* SwissFEL at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland
* SACLA at the RIKEN Harima Institute in Japan
* PAL-XFEL (Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free-Electron Laser) in Korea

In 2022, an upgrade to Stanford University&#x27;s Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II) used temperatures around −271 °C to produce 106 pulses/second of near light-speed electrons, using superconducting niobium cavities.

====Seeding and Self-seeding====
One problem with SASE FELs is the lack of temporal coherence due to a noisy startup process. To avoid this, one can &quot;seed&quot; an FEL with a laser tuned to the resonance of the FEL. Such a temporally coherent seed can be produced by more conventional means, such as by high harmonic generation (HHG) using an optical laser pulse. This results in coherent amplification of the input signal; in effect, the output laser quality is characterized by the seed. While HHG seeds are available at wavelengths down to the extreme ultraviolet, seeding is not feasible at x-ray wavelengths due to the lack of conventional x-ray lasers.

In late 2010, in Italy, the seeded-FEL source FERMI@Elettra started commissioning, at the Trieste Synchrotron Laboratory. FERMI@Elettra is a single-pass FEL user-facility covering the wavelength range from 100 nm (12 eV) to 10 nm (124 eV), located next to the third-generation synchrotron radiation facility ELETTRA in Trieste, Italy.

In 2001, at Brookhaven national laboratory, a seeding technique called &quot;High-Gain Harmonic-Generation&quot; that works to X-ray wavelength has been developed. The technique, which can be multiple-staged in an FEL to achieve increasingly shorter wavelengths, utilizes a longitudinal shift of the radiation relative to the electron bunch to avoid the reduced beam quality caused by a previous stage. This longitudinal staging along the beam is called &quot;Fresh-Bunch&quot;. This technique was demonstrated at x-ray wavelength at Trieste Synchrotron Laboratory.

A similar staging approach, named &quot;Fresh-Slice&quot;, was demonstrated at the Paul Scherrer Institut, also at X-ray wavelengths. In the Fresh Slice the short X-ray pulse produced at the first stage is moved to a fresh part of the electron bunch by a transverse tilt of the bunch. 

In 2012, scientists working on the LCLS found an alternative solution to the seeding limitation for x-ray wavelengths by self-seeding the laser with its own beam after being filtered through a diamond monochromator. The resulting intensity and monochromaticity of the beam were unprecedented and allowed new experiments to be conducted involving manipulating atoms and imaging molecules. Other labs around the world are incorporating the technique into their equipment.

==Research ==

===Biomedical===

====Basic research====
Researchers have explored X-ray free-electron lasers as an alternative to synchrotron light sources that have been the workhorses of protein crystallography and cell biology.

Exceptionally bright and fast X-rays can image proteins using x-ray crystallography. This technique allows first-time imaging of proteins that do not stack in a way that allows imaging by conventional techniques, 25% of the total number of proteins. Resolutions of 0.8 nm have been achieved with pulse durations of 30 femtoseconds. To get a clear view, a resolution of 0.1–0.3 nm is required. The short pulse durations allow images of X-ray diffraction patterns to be recorded before the molecules are destroyed. The bright, fast X-rays were produced at the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC. As of 2014, LCLS was the world&#x27;s most powerful X-ray FEL.

Due to the increased repetition rates of the next-generation X-ray FEL sources, such as the European XFEL, the expected number of diffraction patterns is also expected to increase by a substantial amount. The increase in the number of diffraction patterns will place a large strain on existing analysis methods. To combat this, several methods have been researched to sort the huge amount of data that typical X-ray FEL experiments will generate. While the various methods have been shown to be effective, it is clear that to pave the way towards single-particle X-ray FEL imaging at full repetition rates, several challenges have to be overcome before the next resolution revolution can be achieved. 

New biomarkers for metabolic diseases: taking advantage of the selectivity and sensitivity when combining infrared ion spectroscopy and mass spectrometry scientists can provide a structural fingerprint of small molecules in biological samples, like blood or urine. This new and unique methodology is generating exciting new possibilities to better understand metabolic diseases and develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

==== Surgery ====
Research by Glenn Edwards and colleagues at Vanderbilt University&#x27;s FEL Center in 1994 found that soft tissues including skin, cornea, and brain tissue could be cut, or ablated, using infrared FEL wavelengths around 6.45 micrometres with minimal collateral damage to adjacent tissue. This led to surgeries on humans, the first ever using a free-electron laser. Starting in 1999, Copeland and Konrad performed three surgeries in which they resected meningioma brain tumors. Beginning in 2000, Joos and Mawn performed five surgeries that cut a window in the sheath of the optic nerve, to test the efficacy for optic nerve sheath fenestration. These eight surgeries produced results consistent with the standard of care and with the added benefit of minimal collateral damage. A review of FELs for medical uses is given in the 1st edition of Tunable Laser Applications.

==== Fat removal ====
Several small, clinical lasers tunable in the 6 to 7 micrometre range with pulse structure and energy to give minimal collateral damage in soft tissue have been created. At Vanderbilt, there exists a Raman shifted system pumped by an Alexandrite laser.

Rox Anderson proposed the medical application of the free-electron laser in melting fats without harming the overlying skin. At infrared wavelengths, water in tissue was heated by the laser, but at wavelengths corresponding to 915, 1210 and 1720 nm, subsurface lipids were differentially heated more strongly than water. The possible applications of this selective photothermolysis (heating tissues using light) include the selective destruction of sebum lipids to treat acne, as well as targeting other lipids associated with cellulite and body fat as well as fatty plaques that form in arteries which can help treat atherosclerosis and heart disease.

=== Military ===
FEL technology is being evaluated by the US Navy as a candidate for an anti-aircraft and anti-missile directed-energy weapon. The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility&#x27;s FEL has demonstrated over 14 kW power output. Compact multi-megawatt class FEL weapons are undergoing research. On June 9, 2009 the Office of Naval Research announced it had awarded Raytheon a contract to develop a 100 kW experimental FEL. On March 18, 2010 Boeing Directed Energy Systems announced the completion of an initial design for U.S. Naval use. A prototype FEL system was demonstrated, with a full-power prototype scheduled by 2018.

<text>Taitung City () is a county-administered city and the county seat of Taitung County, Taiwan. It lies on the southeast coast of Taiwan facing the Pacific Ocean. Taitung City is the most populous subdivision of Taitung County and it is one of the major cities on the east coast of the island.

Taitung City is served by Taitung Airport. Taitung is a gateway to Green Island and Orchid Island, both of which are popular tourist destinations.

==History==

Before the 16th century the Taitung plain was settled by agriculturalist Puyuma and Amis aboriginal tribes. Under Dutch rule and during Qing rule, a large part of eastern Taiwan, including today&#x27;s Taitung, was called &quot;Pi-lam&quot; (). Many artifacts of the prehistory sites of the city are located at Beinan Cultural Park, which was discovered in 1980 during the construction of Taitung Station.

In the late 19th century, when Liu Mingchuan was the Qing Governor of Taiwan, Han Chinese settlers moved into the Taitung region. Pi-lam Subprefecture (卑南廳) was established in 1875, and was upgraded and renamed to Taitung Prefecture in 1888, after the island was made Fujian-Taiwan Province.

===Japanese rule===

During Japanese rule, the central settlement was called . was one of twenty local administrative offices established in 1901. English-language works from the era refer to the place as &quot;Pinan&quot; (from Japanese) and &quot;Pilam&quot; (from Hokkien). Taitō Town was established in 1920 under Taitō Prefecture, and included modern Taitung City and eastern Beinan Township. There were no Americans living here during the Japanese rule.

===Post-war===

After handover of Taiwan from Japan to the ROC in 1945, it became Taitung Township and in 1948 it was promoted to Taitung City.

==Climate==
Taitung has a tropical monsoon climate, with a wet season from May to October, a dry season from November to April, and consistently very warm to hot temperatures with high humidity. Unlike most tropical climates, however, the dry season is foggy rather than sunny, so that moisture availability during this period is greater than the low rainfall and warm temperatures would suggest. The highest record of temperature of Taiwan was recorded in Taitung on May 9, 2004, with temperatures peaking above 40 degrees Celsius for the first time in Taiwan&#x27;s recorded history.

<text>A champion (from the late Latin &quot;campio&quot;) is the victor in a challenge, contest or competition. There can be a territorial pyramid of championships, e.g. local, regional/provincial/state, national, continental and world championships, and even further (artificial) divisions at one or more of these levels, as in association football. Their champions can be accordingly styled, e.g. national champion, world champion.

==Meaning==
In certain disciplines, there are specific titles for champions, either descriptive, as the baspehlivan in Turkish oil wrestling, yokozuna in Japanese sumo wrestling; or copied from social hierarchies, such as the &quot;koning&quot; and &quot;keizer&quot; (&#x27;king&#x27; and &#x27;emperor&#x27;) in traditional archery competitions (not just national, also at lower levels) in the Low Countries. 

* In a broader sense, nearly any sort of competition can be considered a championship, and the winner of it a champion. Thus, there are championships for many non-sporting competitions such as spelling bees or wargames. In this context, it is used as a noun.
* It is also possible to &quot;champion a cause&quot;. In an ideological sense, encompassing religion, a champion may be an evangelist, a visionary advocate who clears the field for the triumph of the idea. Or the champion may merely make a strong case for a new corporate division to a resistant board of directors. Such a champion may take on responsibility for publicizing the project and garnering funding. But in this case he or she is beyond a simple promoter. The word is thus used as a verb.
* In economic policy, a national champion is a large company that is dominant in its field and favored by the government of the country in which it is based in the belief that it will be in that country&#x27;s interests if the company is successful in foreign markets. The practice is controversial, and economists mostly don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s beneficial, but it has long been used in France and other countries.

The original meaning of the word partakes of both these senses: in the Feudal Era, knights were expected to be champions and s of both prowess in combat and of causes, the latter most commonly being either patriotic, romantic or religious in nature (thus becoming models of virtue). This reaches its most literal meaning in a trial by combat, in which each combatant champions the cause of one side of the trial. A &quot;King&#x27;s Champion&quot; is appointed for ceremonial purposes at the coronation of an English Monarch, to defeat any challenger to the monarch&#x27;s right to be crowned.

Champion warfare refers to a type of battle, most commonly found in the epic poetry and myth of ancient history, in which the outcome of the conflict is determined by single combat, an individual duel between the best soldiers (&quot;champions&quot;) from each opposing army.

==World champion==
World champion is a title used to denote a winner of a world championship in a particular sport (such as mixed martial arts, professional boxing or professional wrestling), discipline or game. Being a champion at any sport or game requires an extraordinary amount of focus, discipline, drive and complete dedication, usually from a young age. What separates a world champion from the average competitor aside from natural ability and environmental advantages with access to the best training facilities, is the ability to focus on their goal and to become the best of the best, the obsession to continually improve and mental conditioning required to focus on becoming the best in the world at their given subject.

<text>Albion Landing is an unincorporated community in northeastern Calhoun County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Albion Landing is in Clarence Township on the southeast shore of Duck Lake at about ten miles north of Albion and about twelve miles south of Charlotte, Michigan (a place named Charlotte Landing was located just north of Albion Landing on Duck Lake).

Albion Landing, along with all of Clarence Township, is part of the Battle Creek, Michigan Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The area was sold in 1919 to the Albion-Duck Lake Improvement Association and summer cottages were built along the lake. In 1948, the area was platted and an access road built (which developed into Country Club Lane). The area is now more commonly known today as simply Duck Lake, the site of many luxury homes. The Duck Lake Country Club is located nearby.

<text>Kate Orman (born 1968) is an Australian author, best known for her books connected to the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Biography==
Kate Orman was born in Sydney, but grew up in Canberra and Melbourne and spent two years living in the United States. She earned a degree in biology at Sydney University before becoming a professional author. She is a self-described &quot;liberal feminist&quot;.

She is married to American writer Jonathan Blum, whom she met through &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fandom.

==Writing==
Orman penned many spin-off novels from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; for Virgin Publishing, BBC Books and Telos Publishing, the first non-British and first female author to do so. Several of her later &quot;Doctor Who&quot; works were in collaboration with her husband. She has also collaborated with Paul Cornell: Orman and Cornell co-plotted &quot;Human Nature&quot;, written by Cornell, and &quot;Return of the Living Dad&quot;, written by Orman. More recent &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and related work has been for Big Finish.

Orman has also had a number of short science fiction stories published.

In 2004, Orman and Blum&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novella &quot;Fallen Gods&quot;, published by Telos the previous year, won the Aurealis Award for best Australian science-fiction book.

<text>A  (; from the Latin word ) is an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion. Alternative names for this landform are corrie (from , meaning a pot or cauldron) and ; ). A cirque may also be a similarly shaped landform arising from fluvial erosion.

The concave shape of a glacial cirque is open on the downhill side, while the cupped section is generally steep. Cliff-like slopes, down which ice and glaciated debris combine and converge, form the three or more higher sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl-shaped, as it is the complex convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and their accompanying rock burdens. Hence, it experiences somewhat greater erosion forces and is most often overdeepened below the level of the cirque&#x27;s low-side outlet (stage) and its down-slope (backstage) valley. If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting, the floor of the cirque most often forms a tarn (small lake) behind a dam, which marks the downstream limit of the glacial overdeepening. The dam itself can be composed of moraine, glacial till, or a lip of the underlying bedrock.

The fluvial cirque or , found in karst landscapes, is formed by intermittent river flow cutting through layers of limestone and chalk leaving sheer cliffs. A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.

==Formation==

===Glacial-erosion cirque formation===
Glacial cirques are found amongst mountain ranges throughout the world; &#x27;classic&#x27; cirques are typically about one kilometer long and one kilometer wide. Situated high on a mountainside near the firn line, they are typically partially surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs. The highest cliff is often called a headwall. The fourth side forms the &quot;lip&quot;, &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;sill&quot;, the side at which the glacier flowed away from the cirque. Many glacial cirques contain tarns dammed by either till (debris) or a bedrock threshold. When enough snow accumulates, it can flow out the opening of the bowl and form valley glaciers which may be several kilometers long.

Cirques form in conditions which are favorable; in the Northern Hemisphere the conditions include the north-east slope, where they are protected from the majority of the Sun&#x27;s energy and from the prevailing winds. These areas are sheltered from heat, encouraging the accumulation of snow; if the accumulation of snow increases, the snow turns into glacial ice. The process of nivation follows, whereby a hollow in a slope may be enlarged by ice segregation weathering and glacial erosion. Ice segregation erodes the vertical rock face and causes it to disintegrate, which may result in an avalanche bringing down more snow and rock to add to the growing glacier. Eventually, this hollow may become large enough that glacial erosion intensifies. The enlarging of this open ended concavity creates a larger leeward deposition zone, furthering the process of glaciation. Debris (or till) in the ice also may abrade the bed surface; should ice move down a slope it would have a &#x27;sandpaper effect&#x27; on the bedrock beneath, on which it scrapes.

Eventually, the hollow may become a large bowl shape in the side of the mountain, with the headwall being weathered by ice segregation, and as well as being eroded by plucking. The basin will become deeper as it continues to be eroded by ice segregation and abrasion. Should ice segregation, plucking and abrasion continue, the dimensions of the cirque will increase, but the proportion of the landform would remain roughly the same. A bergschrund forms when the movement of the glacier separates the moving ice from the stationary ice, forming a crevasse. The method of erosion of the headwall lying between the surface of the glacier and the cirque&#x27;s floor has been attributed to freeze-thaw mechanisms. The temperature within the bergschrund changes very little, however, studies have shown that ice segregation (frost shattering) may happen with only small changes in temperature. Water that flows into the bergschrund can be cooled to freezing temperatures by the surrounding ice, allowing freeze-thaw free mechanisms to occur.

If two adjacent cirques erode toward one another, an arête, or steep sided ridge, forms. When three or more cirques erode toward one another, a pyramidal peak is created. In some cases, this peak will be made accessible by one or more arêtes. The Matterhorn in the European Alps is an example of such a peak.

Where cirques form one behind the other, a cirque stairway results, as at the Zastler Loch in the Black Forest.

As glaciers can only originate above the snowline, studying the location of present-day cirques provides information on past glaciation patterns and on climate change.

===Fluvial-erosion cirque formation===
Although a less common usage, the term cirque is also used for amphitheatre-shaped, fluvial-erosion features. For example, an approximately anticlinal erosion cirque is at on the southern boundary of the Negev highlands. This erosional cirque or &quot;&quot; was formed by intermittent river flow in the Makhtesh Ramon cutting through layers of limestone and chalk, resulting in cirque walls with a sheer drop. The Cirque du Bout du Monde is another such feature, created in karst terraine in the Burgundy region of the department of in France.

Yet another type of fluvial erosion-formed cirque is found on Réunion island, which includes the tallest volcanic structure in the Indian Ocean. The island consists of an active shield-volcano () and an extinct, deeply eroded volcano (Piton des Neiges). Three cirques have eroded there in a sequence of agglomerated, fragmented rock and volcanic breccia associated with pillow lavas overlain by more coherent, solid lavas.

A common feature for all fluvial-erosion cirques is a terrain which includes erosion resistant upper structures overlying materials which are more easily eroded.

<text>Zhubei (Wade-Giles: &quot;Chupei&quot;; Hakka PFS: &quot;Chuk-pet&quot;; Hokkien POJ: &quot;Tek-pak&quot;) is a city in Hsinchu County, Taiwan. It is one of the island&#x27;s fastest-growing settlements, with a population gain of 51,000 between 2010 and 2019, the highest of any township/city or district. The city has attracted migration both because of its proximity to Hsinchu City and the Hsinchu Science and Technology Park, and because the Hsinchu County government has focused most of its infrastructure here.

It is governed as a county-administered city, and is the county seat of Hsinchu County. Taiwan High Speed Rail&#x27;s Hsinchu HSR station is located here.

==History==

==Geography==
Zhubei borders Hsinchu City to the southwest, Xinfeng and Hukou Townships to the north, Qionglin and Xinpu to the East, Zhudong to the southeast, and the Taiwan Strait to its west. It is the discharge point of the Fongshan River and the Touqian River into the Taiwan Strait. Zhubei has been a satellite city of Hsinchu City since Hsinchu City reformed to become a special municipality in 1982. Due to the separation of Hsinchu City from Hsinchu County and Zhubei becoming the Hsinchu County seat, as well as its proximity to the Hsinchu Science and Technology Park and the semiconductor industry, the city has acquired an increasingly large amount of capital inflow from government, as well as a rapid population increase and a resulting spike in real estate values. The city&#x27;s population was estimated at 211,746 in February 2023.

==Administrative divisions==
The city is administered as 30 villages: Aikou, Baide, Beilun, Beixing, Chongyi, Damei, Dayi, Doulun, Fude, Lianxing, Luchang, Mayuan, Shangyi, Shixing, Taihe, Tunghai, Tungping, Tungxing, Wenhua, Xingan, Xingang, Xinguo, Xinlun, Xinshe, Xinzhuang, Xizhou, Zhongxing, Zhubei, Zhuren and Zhuyi.

==Government institutions==
* Hsinchu County Government

==Economy==

The agricultural aspect of Zhubei has shifted from mainly rice paddy farming to more floral and fruit cultivation that attracts tourists; however the majority of the local economy is now fueled by the semiconductor industry, real estate speculation and the service sector.

<text>Quibdó () is the capital city of Chocó Department, in the Pacific Region of Colombia, and is located on the Atrato River. The municipality of Quibdó has an area of and a population of 129,237, predominantly Afro Colombian, including Zambo Colombians.

==History==
In prehistoric times, the Chocó rainforest and mountains constituted a major barrier dividing the Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations. The high rainfall and the extremely humid climate did not attract the Spanish colonists. The Emberá people ceded much of their territory to the Spanish Franciscan order in 1648. Subsequent attacks on colonial outposts by hostile tribes discouraged attempts at settlement. Six years later, the Spanish began again to colonize the region, eventually establishing some lumber camps and plantations where they used enslaved Africans as workers.

It was not until the nineteenth century when there was interest in finding a shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to avoid traveling via the Straits of Magellan that the Chocó region again became of significant interest to European colonial powers, as the Atrato River Valley was thought the best possibility for this purpose by the explorer Alexander von Humboldt; however this idea was eventually shelved in favor of the Panama Canal. At the same time that research on using the Chocó to connect the Pacific and Atlantic was being carried out, gold and platinum were discovered in the Atrato Valley and this ensured Quibdó’s growth and status as the chief town in the region.

Another crucial development at this time was the migration of freed black slaves into the Chocó; they were primarily working in shifting cultivation to cope with the extreme leaching from the super-humid climate. They also fished and harvested forest products.

The 1853 watercolors by Manuel María Paz document two mestizo or European men with an Afro-Colombian street vendor, and depict the dress of Afro-Colombian and European women in the town square.

The Afro-Colombian communities established trade with highland cities such as Medellín via rough mule trails that were used until the 1950s. A combination of population growth and declining values for the region’s natural resources gradually resulted in an economic downturn for the region and especially Quibdó.

==Climate==
Quibdó has an extremely wet and cloudy tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;) without noticeable seasons. It has the highest amount of rainfall in South America of any city of its size or greater. A comparable high-rainfall city of larger size, Monrovia in Liberia, receives less rain annually than Quibdó. The extreme rainfall occurs because the Andes, to the east of the city, block the westerly winds driven by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Throughout the year, owing to the Humboldt Current off the West coast of South America, these winds remain centered in the north of the continent at Quibdó’s longitudes. The result is that the extremely unstable, ascending air from the Intertropical Convergence Zone is consistently forced to rise over the Chocó plain; as it cools, enormous quantities of moisture precipitate as rainfall. What is more, due to the exuberant nature and biodiversity in the region, a biotic pump phenomena causes the Chocó low-level-jet, another important factor in driving atmospheric moisture from the Pacific into the Colombian Andes.

Rain falls almost every day from clouds in intense thunderstorms; the region has a wet season year round. Some 309 days (84%) of the year are rainy. Sunny periods seldom last more than a few hours after sunrise. Quibdó has only 1,276 hours of sunshine annually, and it ranks as one of the cloudiest cities in the world. Its sunniest month is July, with typically a total of 135 hours of sunshine for the entire month.

==Transportation==
Quibdó is served by El Caraño Airport with flights by three commercial airlines.

<text>Equatorial Guinea competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, which was held from 13 to 29 August 2004. The country&#x27;s participation at Athens marked its sixth appearance in the Summer Olympics since its début at the 1984 Summer Olympics. The delegation included two athletics competitors: Roberto Mandje and Emilia Mikue Ondo in the long and middle distance disciplines respectively. Mikue Ondo was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Both athletes did not advance further than the first round of their respective events with Mandje failing to make the start of the men&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase.
==Background==
Equatorial Guinea participated in six Summer Games between its début at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. No Equatoguinean athlete has ever won a medal at the Olympic Games. Equatorial Guinea participated in the Athens Summer Games from 13 to 29 August 2004. The two athletes selected to represent Equatorial Guinea in the Athens Games were athletics competitors Roberto Mandje and Emilia Mikue Ondo. Eric Moussambani, who gained international recognition with his performance at the previous Olympics in Sydney in 2000, was denied entry into the Athens Olympics as officials could not find his passport photograph. Mikue Ondo was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony while Mandje carried it at the closing ceremony.

==Athletics==
Roberto Mandje was the only male athlete representing Equatorial Guinea at the Athens Olympics. He had not previously competed in any prior Olympic Games. In an interview with BBC Spor prior to the Games, Mandje spoke of the pressure he faced from people in his home country expecting him to do well and wanted to quash comparisons to Moussambani he had been receiving: &quot;I feel pretty ready and we will see how I finish. I hope I don&#x27;t turn it into a racewalking event!&quot;

He was drawn in the first heat of the men&#x27;s 1500 metres on 20 August, finishing twelfth out of thirteen competitors, with a time of 4 minutes and 3.37 seconds. Mandje&#x27;s time set a new national record in the discipline. Overall he finished 37th out of 39 runners who ran the whole heat, and did not make the semi-finals since only the top five finishers in each heat and the quickest next nine runners could advance to the next round. He was drawn in heat one of the men&#x27;s 3000 metres steeplechase the following day but was unable to start the discipline.

Competing at her first Olympic Games, Emilia Mikue Ondo was the youngest athlete to represent Equatorial Guinea in Athens at the age of 19. She competed in the women&#x27;s 800 metres and was drawn in the fourth heat. Mikue Ondo completed the heat in a time of two 2 minutes, 22.88 seconds for seventh and last out of her heat. As the top three runners in each heat and the following six quickest were allowed to go through to the semi-finals, Mikue Ondo&#x27;s competition ended in the first round since she was 41st out of 42 finishers overall.

<text>Zhongli District () is a district in Taoyuan City, Taiwan. Zhongli is spelled variously as &quot;Jungli&quot;, &quot;Jongli&quot;, &quot;Jhongli&quot; or &quot;Chungli&quot; on railway stations, bus stops and road signs. Historically, the city is the site of the Zhongli Incident of 1977, the most significant event of the democratization movement prior to the 1980s. Ethnically, it is considered a capital city for Hakka Taiwanese, who live in great numbers here and in surrounding areas; many elderly persons can speak Hakka in addition to Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien. In recent years many foreign workers (mainly from the Philippines and Thailand) have also settled in and around the city due to the heavy industry in the suburbs of the city, making it a center for foreign laborers. The district of Zhongli has three large parks and over 70 green reserves.

Zhongli District is the busiest district in Southern Taoyuan (南桃園), as well as the location of the Taoyuan HSR station.

==History==

===Qing dynasty===
In the 19th century, the area was home to Plains aborigines. During the Qing dynasty, immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong provinces arrived along with Hakka. The original name of the area was &quot;Kan-a-lek&quot; () due to its location between Tamsui and Hsinchu.

During Japanese rule, the town was administered as , Chūreki District, Shinchiku Prefecture.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, Zhongli was reorganized as &quot;Zhongli Town&quot;. In October 1950, it was placed under Taoyuan County. On 1 July 1967, Zhongli was promoted to a county-administered city and became &quot;Zhongli City&quot;. On 25 December 2014, as Taoyuan County was upgraded to a special municipality named Taoyuan City, Zhongli became a district of the municipality.

==Demographics==
Zhongli&#x27;s population was estimated at 426,326 in March 2023, including 10,084 Taiwanese aborigines. Zhongli is subdivided into 85 villages, with the eight biggest but least populated villages on the western side of the district (39 square kilometers but with 35,000 people), while the eastern side is occupied by industrial factories and the heart of the metropolitan area. This reflects the imbalance of development of western and eastern Zhongli.

===Industry===
The Zhongli–Neili Industrial Park was established in December 1976. This is a combined multipurpose industrial park, controlled by Taiwan&#x27;s Economic Bureau, with a total area of 433 sq. yards.

<text>Reading is an action performed by computers, to acquire data from a source and place it into their volatile memory for processing. Computers may read information from a variety of sources, such as magnetic storage, the Internet, or audio and video input ports. Reading is one of the core functions of a Turing machine.

A read cycle is the act of reading one unit of information (e.g. a byte). A read channel is an electrical circuit that transforms the physical magnetic flux changes into abstract bits. A read error occurs when the physical part of the process fails for some reason, such as dust or dirt entering the drive.

== Example ==
For example, a computer may read information off a floppy disk and store it temporarily in random-access memory before it is written to the hard drive to be processed at a future date.

== Memory types ==

=== CMOS ===

Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) is a non-volatile medium. It is used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, static RAM, and other digital logic circuits. Memory is read through the use of a combination of p-type and n-type metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). In CMOS logic, a collection of n-type MOSFETs are arranged in a pull-down network between the output node and the lower-voltage power supply rail, named Vss, which often has ground potential. By asserting or de-asserting the inputs to the CMOS circuit, individual transistors along the pull-up and pull-down networks become conductive and resistive to electric current, and results in the desired path connecting from the output node to one of the voltage rails.

=== Flash ===

Flash memory stores information in an array of memory cells made from floating-gate transistors. Flash memory utilizes either NOR logic or NAND logic.

In NOR gate flash, each cell resembles a standard MOSFET, except the transistor has two gates instead of one. On top is the control gate (CG), as in other MOS transistors, but below this, there is a floating gate (FG) insulated all around by an oxide layer. The FG is interposed between the CG and the MOSFET channel, and because the FG is electrically isolated by its insulating layer, any electrons placed on it are trapped there and, under normal conditions, will not discharge for many years. When current flow through the MOSFET channel binary code is generated, reproducing the stored data.

NAND gate flash utilizes tunnel injection for writing and tunnel release for erasing. NAND flash memory forms the core of the removable USB storage devices known as USB flash drives, as well as most memory card formats available today.

=== Magnetic ===

The magnetic medium is found in magnetic tape, hard disk drives, floppy disks, and so on. This medium uses different patterns of magnetization in a magnetizable material to store data and is a form of non-volatile memory. Magnetic storage media can be classified as either sequential access memory or random-access memory.

Magnetic-core memory uses toroids (rings) of a hard magnetic material (usually a semi-hard ferrite) as transformer cores, where each wire threaded through the core serves as a transformer winding. Two or more wires pass through each core. Magnetic hysteresis allows each of the cores to store a state.

=== Mechanical ===
The mechanical medium utilizes one of the oldest methods of computing and has largely become obsolete. The earliest known method of memory storage and subsequent computerized reading is the Antikythera mechanism (c. 100–150 BCE) which utilizes over thirty gears that spin a dial indicator. Following the Antikythera mechanism, Hero of Alexandria (c. 10–70 CE) designed an entirely mechanical play almost ten minutes in length, powered by a binary-like system of ropes, knots, and simple machines operated by a rotating cylindrical cogwheel.

Punched cards were a common storage medium for computers from 1900 to 1950. The information was read through a method of identifying the holes in the card.

=== Optical discs ===

Optical discs refer to the non-volatile flat, circular, usually polycarbonate discs. Data is stored in pits or bumps arranged sequentially on the continuous, spiral track extending from the innermost track to the outermost track, covering the entire disc surface. Data is read by a means of a laser; when the laser enters a pit, the focus of the laser is changed and interpenetrated by the reader&#x27;s software.

=== Random-access memory ===
Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage. A random-access device allows stored data to be accessed directly in any random order. In contrast, other data storage media such as hard disks, CDs, DVDs and magnetic tape, as well as early primary memory types such as drum memory, read and write data only in a predetermined order, consecutively, because of mechanical design limitations. Therefore, the time to access a given data location varies significantly depending on its physical location. Today, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits. Strictly speaking, modern types of DRAM are not random access, as data is read in bursts, although the name DRAM / RAM has stuck. However, many types of SRAM, ROM, OTP, and NOR flash are still random access even in a strict sense. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM memory modules), where its stored information is lost if the power is removed. Many other types of non-volatile memory are RAM as well, including most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash. The first RAM modules to come into the market were created in 1951 and were sold until the late 1960s and early 1970s.

<text>Canada competed at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, United States.
These Games were the second at which Canadian athletes participated. As in 1900 they did not compete under the Canadian flag, national teams not being introduced until the next Olympics. Unofficially, however, it was a very successful Olympics for Canada with Canadian competitors winning the fourth most medals. However, this was largely because most Europeans decided not to make the long trip to compete in the games. The Canadian athletes were a unified group for the first time and were unofficially regarded as a team.

==Medallists==

The most notable Canadian medal winner was Etienne Desmarteau who placed first in the 56 pound weight throw. He was fired as a Montreal police officer when he left to compete at the games. Returning as a medallist and local hero he was reinstated, but died the next year of typhoid.

Canada won two golds in team sports, two thirds of Canada&#x27;s total in all summer games. The Canadian soccer team from Galt, Ontario won gold and a team known as the Winnipeg Shamrocks won the field lacrosse title. The third-place finishers were also from Canada, a team of Mohawks from a reserve near Brantford.

Of note was Peter Deer, an Iroquois Indian, who competed in the 800 &amp; 1500 metres races; he was the first Native person to represent Canada outside her borders. Deer was a mechanic by day and was a member of the Montreal Amateur Athletics Association. He was 23 in 1904, he came from Caughnawaga, a native village on the South Bank.

==Results by event==

<doc id="945696" wikidata="Q130955" url="?curid=945696" title="Acanthodii">
<text>Acanthodii or acanthodians is an extinct class of gnathostomes (jawed fishes). They are currently considered to represent a paraphyletic grade of various fish lineages basal to extant Chondrichthyes, which includes living sharks, rays, and chimaeras. Acanthodians possess a mosaic of features shared with both osteichthyans (bony fish) and chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish). In general body shape, they were similar to modern sharks, but their epidermis was covered with tiny rhomboid platelets like the scales of holosteians (gars, bowfins).

The popular name &quot;spiny sharks&quot; is because they were superficially shark-shaped, with a streamlined body, paired fins, a strongly upturned tail, and stout, largely immovable bony spines supporting all the fins except the tail—hence, &quot;spiny sharks&quot;. However, acanthodians are not true sharks; their close relation to modern cartilaginous fish can lead them to be considered &quot;stem-sharks&quot;. Acanthodians had a cartilaginous skeleton, but their fins had a wide, bony base and were reinforced on their anterior margin with a dentine spine. As a result, fossilized spines and scales are often all that remains of these fishes in ancient sedimentary rocks. The earliest acanthodians were marine, but during the Devonian, freshwater species became predominant.

Acanthodians have been divided into four orders: Acanthodiformes, Climatiiformes, Diplacanthiformes, and Ischnacanthiformes. &quot;Climatiiformes&quot; is a paraphyletic assemblage of early acanthodians such as climatiids, gyracanthids, and diplacanthids; they had robust bony shoulder girdles and many small sharp spines (&quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;prepelvic&quot; spines) between the pectoral and pelvic fins. The climatiiform subgroup Diplacanthida has subsequently been elevated to its own order, Diplacanthiformes. Ischnacanthiforms were predators with tooth plates fused to their jaws. Acanthodiforms were filter feeders with a single dorsal fin, toothless jaws, and long gill rakers. They were the last and most specialized off the traditional acanthodians, as they survived up until the Permian period.

==Characteristics==


The scales of Acanthodii have distinctive ornamentation peculiar to each order. Because of this, the scales are often used in determining relative age of sedimentary rock. The scales are tiny, with a bulbous base, a neck, and a flat or slightly curved diamond-shaped crown.

Despite being called &quot;spiny sharks&quot;, acanthodians predate sharks. Scales that have been tentatively identified as belonging to acanthodians, or &quot;shark-like fishes&quot; have been found in various Ordovician strata, though, they are ambiguous, and may actually belong to jawless fishes such as thelodonts. The earliest unequivocal acanthodian fossils date from the beginning of the Silurian Period, some 50 million years before the first sharks appeared. Later, the acanthodians colonized fresh waters, and thrived in the rivers and lakes during the Devonian and in the coal swamps of Carboniferous. By this time bony fishes were already showing their potential to dominate the waters of the world, and their competition proved too much for the spiny sharks, which died out in Permian times (approximately 250 million years ago).

Many palaeontologists originally considered the acanthodians close to the ancestors of the bony fishes. Although their interior skeletons were made of cartilage, a bonelike material had developed in the skins of these fishes, in the form of closely fitting scales (see above). Some scales were greatly enlarged and formed a bony covering on top of the head and over the lower shoulder girdle. Others developed a bony flap over the gill openings analogous to the operculum in later bony fishes. However, most of these characteristics are considered homologous characteristics derived from common placoderm ancestors, and present also in basal cartilaginous fish. Overall, the acanthodians&#x27; jaws are presumed to have evolved from the first gill arch of some ancestral jawless fishes that had a gill skeleton made of pieces of jointed cartilage.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

In a study of early jawed vertebrate relationships, Davis &quot;et al.&quot; (2012) found acanthodians to be split among the two major clades Osteichthyes (bony fish) and Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish). The well-known acanthodian &quot;Acanthodes&quot; was placed within Osteichthyes, despite the presence of many chondrichthyan characteristics in its braincase. However, a newly described Silurian placoderm, &quot;Entelognathus&quot;, which has jaw anatomy shared with bony fish and tetrapods, has led to revisions of this phylogeny: acanthodians were then considered to be a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish, while bony fish evolved from placoderm ancestors.

Burrow et al. 2016 provides vindication by finding chondrichthyans to be nested among Acanthodii, most closely related to &quot;Doliodus&quot; and &quot;Tamiobatis&quot;. A 2017 study of &quot;Doliodus&quot; morphology points out that it appears to display a mosaic of shark and acanthodian features, making it a transitional fossil and further reinforcing this idea.

Phylogeny after

== Evolutionary history ==
The oldest remains attributed acanthodian-grade chondrichthyans are &quot;Fanjingshania&quot; and &quot;Qianodus&quot; from the Early Silurian of China, dating to around 439 million years ago.&quot;&quot; Compared to other contemporary groups of fish, acanthodians were relatively morphologically and ecologically conservative. Acanthodians rose in diversity during the Late Silurian, reaching their apex of diversity during the Lochkovian stage of the Early Devonian, declining during the Pragian but rising again during the following Emsian, which was followed by a decline in diversity during middle-Late Devonian. The diversity of the group was consistently low but stable during the Carboniferous, slightly decreasing going into the Permian. The youngest records of the group are isolated scales and fin spines from Middle-Late Permian strata in the Paraná Basin of Brazil.

<text>BBC Books (also formerly known as BBC Consumer Publishing and BBC Publishing) is an imprint majority-owned and managed by Penguin Random House through its Ebury Publishing division. The minority shareholder is BBC Studios, the commercial subsidiary of the British Broadcasting Corporation. The imprint has been active since the 1980s.

BBC Books publishes a range of books connected to BBC radio and television programming, including cookery, natural history, lifestyle, and behind the scenes &quot;making-of&quot; books. There are also some non-programme related biographies and autobiographies of various well-known personalities in its list.

Amongst BBC Books&#x27; best known titles are cookery books by former TV cook Delia Smith, wildlife titles by Sir David Attenborough and gardening titles by Alan Titchmarsh. In the BBC Publishing days, it turned down &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, a book which has now sold over 14,000,000 copies worldwide.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
Since 1996, BBC Books has also produced a range of tie-in novels connected to the television science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the only full-length fiction to be printed by the company. Their first release related to the series was a novelisation of the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; telemovie published in the spring of 1996. Then, in 1997, BBC Books launched two concurrent series of books, the Eighth Doctor Adventures (EDA) (featuring the then-current incarnation of the Doctor), and the Past Doctor Adventures (PDA), featuring the seven previous incarnations. Between 1997 and 2005 approximately 150 original novels were published for both lines, combined. BBC Books also launched a short-lived line of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related short story collections called &quot;Short Trips&quot;; Big Finish Productions later obtained the rights to publish the &quot;Short Trips&quot; books and that series continues as of 2010.

In 2005, BBC Books began to phase out the EDA and PDA lines as it launched a new series of books (informally dubbed the New Series Adventures) based upon the newly revived television series. Featuring the Ninth Doctor, the new books were published in hardback (as opposed to the EDA, PDA and &quot;Short Trips&quot; lines that were exclusively paperback releases). The Eighth Doctor line was discontinued during the summer of 2005, followed by the final Past Doctor Adventure in November. Beginning in 2006, BBC Books continued the New Series Adventures, now featuring the Tenth Doctor, with no word (as of September 2009) whether any more Past Doctor Adventures are planned. The books continue to be published in hardback, with the exception of four novellas, &quot;I Am a Dalek&quot;, &quot;Made of Steel&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Judoon&quot; and &quot;Code of the Krillitanes&quot;, which are paperback releases under a series called Quick Reads. The 4th novella still featured the tenth doctor David Tennant, even though the eleventh has made his TV appearance.

In January 2007, BBC Books launched a new line of original novels based upon the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series, &quot;Torchwood&quot;. These books are also being published exclusively in hardcover and, like the TV series itself, are aimed at an older audience.

In May 2008, BBC Books issued its first original made-for-audio &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventure, &quot;Pest Control&quot;, which was released as part of the Tenth Doctor Adventures line and read by David Tennant. The Audiobook of the Year 2010 was a Tenth Doctor adventure called Dead Air by James Goss and read by David Tennant.

==&quot;Being Human&quot;==
In 2010, a series of three &quot;Being Human&quot; novels were published by BBC Books. These novels describe the adventures of the three main characters Annie Sawyer, George Sands and John Mitchell of the BBC Three television series Being Human and are written by Simon Guerrier, Mark Michalowski and James Goss. All novels were also released as audiobooks. &quot;The Road&quot; was read by Lenora Crichlow, &quot;Chasers&quot; by Russell Tovey and &quot;Bad Blood&quot; by Lucy Gaskell.

==New ownership==
In 2006, the Ebury Publishing division of Random House acquired a majority shareholding in BBC Books.

==Sherlock Holmes==
In 2011, BBC Books launched a publishing programme around BAFTA-winning TV series, Sherlock, which was inspired by the adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Victorian detective Sherlock Holmes. The titles will each feature the show&#x27;s branding and introductions by key members of the Sherlock team, including co-founders Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss.

The first title, Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock: A Study in Scarlet&quot;, with an introduction by Steven Moffat was released on 15 September 2011.
Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with an introduction by Mark Gatiss, followed on 27 October 2011.

Three books &quot;Sherlock: Sign of Four, Sherlock: The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;Sherlock: The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; with introductions by Martin Freeman, Steve Thompson and Benedict Cumberbatch were released on 29 March 2012.

In autumn 2012, BBC Books has published &quot;Sherlock: The Casebook&quot; as a hardback gift guide, revisiting all the mysteries solved throughout the TV series.

<text>A rapid reaction force / rapid response force (RRF), quick reaction force / quick response force (QRF), immediate reaction force (IRF), rapid deployment force (RDF), or quick maneuver force (QMF) is a military or Law Enforcement unit capable of responding to emergencies in a very short time frame.

== Types ==
=== Quick reaction force ===
A quick reaction force (QRF) is an armed military unit capable of rapidly responding to developing situations, usually to assist allied units in need of assistance. They are equipped to respond to any type of emergency within a short time frame, often only a few minutes, based on unit standard operating procedures (SOPs). Cavalry units are frequently postured as QRFs, with a main mission of security and reconnaissance. 
A quick reaction force belongs directly to the commander of the unit it is created from and is typically held in the reserve.

=== Rapid deployment force ===

A rapid deployment force (RDF) is a military formation that is capable of fast deployment outside their country&#x27;s borders. They typically consist of well-trained military units (special forces, paratroopers, marines, etc.) that can be deployed fairly quickly or on short notice, usually from other major assets and without requiring a large organized support force immediately. 

== List ==
=== Rapid reaction force ===

* The concept of a United Nations rapid reaction force was proposed in the mid-1990s by several commentators and officials, including Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. The UN rapid reaction force would consist of personnel stationed in their home countries, but they would have the same training, equipment, and procedures, and would conduct joint exercises. The force would remain at high readiness at all times so as to quickly deploy them where necessary.
* The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is a NATO rapid reaction force, established in 1992. A successor to the British Army&#x27;s I Corps, the ARRC is capable of rapidly deploying a NATO headquarters for operations and crisis response.
* The European Gendarmerie Force (EUROGENDFOR) is a European rapid reaction force under the European Union, established in 2006. An alliance of gendarmerie forces from Italy, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Spain, it serves as a unified intervention force of European militarized police.
* The European Rapid Operational Force (EUROFOR) was a European rapid reaction force under the European Union and Western European Union, established in 1995 and composed of military units from Italy, France, Portugal, and Spain. EUROFOR was tasked with performing duties outlined in the Petersberg Tasks. EUROFOR deployed to Kosovo from 2000 to 2001, and North Macedonia as part of EUFOR Concordia in 2003. After being converted into an EU Battlegroup, EUROFOR was dissolved in 2012.
* The European Rapid Reaction Force (ERRF) was the intended result of the Helsinki Headline Goal. Though many media reports suggested the ERRF would be a European Union army, the Helsinki Headline Goal was little more than headquarters arrangements and a list of theoretically available national forces for a rapid reaction force.
* The NATO Response Force (NRF) is a NATO rapid reaction force, established in 2003. Distinct from the ARRC, the NRF comprises land, sea, air, and special forces units that can be deployed quickly.
* Riot Police Units (RPU) are the rapid reaction forces of Japanese prefectural police. They combine riot police, police tactical units, and disaster response squads under one unit. Each prefectural police force operates RPUs, sometimes under different names.
* Rapid Action Force of India
* Army Deployment Force of Singapore
* 2nd Quick Response Division ROK Marine Corps Quick Maneuver Force
* The Immediate Response Force (IRF) is an American rapid reaction force composed of units from the United States Army and United States Air Force. They are capable of responding to any location in the world within 18 hours of notice.
* The Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF) was a British Armed Forces capability concept created in 1999. The force was composed of units from all three branches of the British military, and was able to rapidly deploy anywhere in the world at short notice. However, the War in Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq siphoned British personnel and equipment, leaving the JRRF with insufficient forces. The JRRF was succeeded by the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force in 2010 and the Joint Expeditionary Force in 2014.

The second is infantry battalions designated as RDF, each Army Area has one RDF battalion including The 3rd Infantry Battalion, 19th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Infantry Division was designated the RDF of the First Army Area. • The 1st Infantry Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment of the 6th Infantry Division was designated the RDF of the Second Army Area. • The 1st Infantry Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 7th Infantry Division was designated the RDF of the Third Army Area. • The 2nd Infantry Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment of the 5th Infantry Division was designated the RDF of the Fourth Army Area.
* The Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) was a former United States Department of Defense joint task force. It was formed in 1979 as the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), envisioned as a mobile force that could quickly deploy U.S. forces to any location outside the usual American deployment areas of Western Europe and East Asia, soon coming to focus on the Middle East. It was inactivated in 1983 and reorganized as the United States Central Command.

<text>Christine Elizabeth Fletcher (née Lees, born 25 January 1955) is a New Zealand politician. Currently an Auckland Council councillor, she was previously a National Party Member of Parliament from 1990 to 1999, and served one term as Mayor of Auckland City between 1998 and 2001. In October 2010 she became the co-leader of the Auckland local body ticket Citizens &amp; Ratepayers after winning the Albert-Eden-Roskill ward on the new Auckland Council.

==Early life and family==
Fletcher was born in 1955, the daughter of Shirley and Ted Lees, the founder of heavy machinery and marine engine company Lees Industries. Educated at St Cuthbert&#x27;s College, Auckland, she was married to Angus Fletcher, and was thus the sister-in-law of former Fletcher Challenge CEO Hugh Fletcher and his wife Chief Justice Sian Elias.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===

At the 1990 general election, Fletcher was the National Party candidate for the Eden electorate, and defeated the Labour incumbent, Richard Northey. She then held the seat at the 1993 election. After Labour MP Peter Dunne became an independent MP in October 1994 Fletcher approached him to join the National Party. Dunne declined the offer however.

She won the new Epsom electorate in the 1996 election, and was subsequently appointed to the ministerial roles of Local Government, Women&#x27;s Affairs and Cultural Affairs. However, she resigned as a minister on 11 September 1997, because she objected to the sale of the assets of the Auckland Regional Services Trust proposed by National.

===Mayor of Auckland City===
Fletcher retired as an MP in 1999, having been elected Mayor of Auckland City at the 1998 local-body elections. She was the second woman to hold the office, after Cath Tizard. Fletcher&#x27;s mayoralty was characterised by the decision to progress with the Britomart Transport Centre in downtown Auckland. In 2001 she was defeated by John Banks, another former National MP. She continued her opposition to Banks in the following years, particularly opposing the Eastern Transport Corridor, which Banks had proposed as a major motorway, and which she noted she had been opposing for more than a decade by then.

In 1993 Fletcher was awarded a New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In the 2002 New Year Honours, Fletcher was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

She ran again for the mayoralty in October 2004, but finished third behind Dick Hubbard and Banks.

===Life after mayoralty and return to politics===


After her mayoral term, Fletcher became involved in various community organisations, including the Motutapu Trust, a conservation body involved in protecting Motutapu Island in the Hauraki Gulf.

She was a contributor in 2004 to a book by the Better Democracy group, promoting citizen participation in the New Zealand democratic process.

In 2010 she announced her candidacy for the Albert-Eden-Roskill ward on the new Auckland council, where she eventually succeeded in polling highest for one of the two available councillor seats in her ward. She considered that working for a CBD rail tunnel was one of her main priorities, extending the capacity of Britomart, whose construction she had successfully fought for in her mayoral term.

Fletcher was re-elected in 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2022.

<doc id="945731" wikidata="Q5098337" url="?curid=945731" title="Children Overboard affair">
<text>The Children Overboard affair was an Australian political controversy involving public allegations by Howard government ministers in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election, that seafaring asylum seekers had thrown children overboard in a presumed ploy to secure rescue and passage on 7 October 2001.

The government&#x27;s handling of this and other events involving unauthorised arrivals worked to its advantage. The &quot;Tampa&quot; affair had led the government to adopt stricter border protection measures to prevent unauthorised arrivals from reaching Australia by boat. Polls indicated the measures had public support. The government was able to portray itself as &quot;strong&quot; on border protection measures and its opponents as &quot;weak&quot;. In November 2001, the Liberal-National coalition was re-elected with an increased majority.

The Australian Senate &quot;Select Committee for an inquiry into a certain maritime incident&quot; later found that no children had been at risk of being thrown overboard and that the government had known this prior to the election. The government was criticised for misleading the public and cynically &quot;(exploiting) voters&#x27; fears of a wave of illegal immigrants by demonising asylum-seekers&quot;.

Although reports indicated that the strain of being towed was the proximate cause of the asylum seeker boat eventually sinking, Australian Prime Minister John Howard asserted that the asylum seekers &quot;irresponsibly sank the damn boat, which put their children in the water&quot;.

==Background==
In the early afternoon of 6 October 2001, HMAS &quot;Adelaide&quot; intercepted a southbound wooden-hulled vessel, designated SIEV 4 (Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel), carrying 223 passengers and crew, north of Christmas Island, and the vessel then sank. The next day, which was the day before the issue of writs for the 2001 federal election, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock announced that passengers of SIEV 4 had threatened to throw children overboard. This claim was later repeated by other senior government ministers including Defence Minister Peter Reith and Prime Minister Howard.

==Senate inquiry==

A Senate select committee inquiry, composed mainly of non-government senators, found that no children were thrown overboard from SIEV 4, that the evidence did not support the Children Overboard claim, and that the photographs purported to show children thrown into the sea were taken after SIEV 4 sank. In response, Howard said that he acted on the intelligence he was given at the time.

A minority dissenting report, authored by government senators on the committee, described the inquiry as driven by a &quot;misplaced sense of self-righteous outrage [felt] by the Australian Labor Party at its defeat in the 2001 federal elections&quot;. An appendix to their report documented cases where passengers aboard other SIEVs had threatened children, sabotaged their own vessels, committed self-harm and, in the case of SIEV 7 on 22 October, thrown a child overboard who was rescued by another asylum seeker.

==Scrafton revelations==

Michael Scrafton, a former senior advisor to Peter Reith, revealed on 16 August 2004 that he told Howard on 7 November 2001 that the Children Overboard claim might be untrue. Howard said that they only discussed the inconclusive nature of the video footage. In light of the new information, the Labor opposition called for further inquiry.

On 29 August, Howard announced the 2004 federal election. On 1 September, a second inquiry composed mainly of non-government senators was convened. While the final report on 9 December found Scrafton&#x27;s claims to be credible, government committee members questioned the reliability of Scrafton&#x27;s recollections and wrote a minority dissenting report challenging that finding.

== History ==

=== History of the name ===
In the 1510s, during Ottoman rule over Greece, a villager from Kalavryta decided to move and reform the area of Pyrgos which up until then was uncultivated. During this reformation he found in a well a large amount of gold ancient coins which he delivered to the Sultan as the rightful owner. The Sultan, Selim I (1470-1520), in order to honor his integrity named him ruler of the region (1512) and gave him a great acreage expanding from Alfeios river until the village Agios Ioannis which is located near Katakolo (the main port of the Elis region). This area was encompassing today&#x27;s Pyrgos and was uninhabited. According to the stories the new ruler built a great tower (Πύργος, &quot;pyrgos&quot; in Greek) on a hill in order to supervise his fields and his flocks. This was the first settlement of the area.

==Climate==
Pyrgos has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with hot and dry summers and rainy winters with generally mild temperatures. Annual precipitation is sizeable, like most of Western Greece, nearly 900 mm, while it peaks in late autumn.

==Transportation==
Pyrgos has a train station with regular trains to the port of Katakolo and Olympia. Service on the line from Patras to Kalamata via Pyrgos has been suspended in 2011. Pyrgos has a bus terminal, served by KTEL Ileias, with regular buses for the regional routes to most places in Elis as well as for intercity routes to Athens and to larger cities such as Patras, Kalamata, Ioannina and Thessaloniki. The Greek National Road 9 connects Pyrgos with Patras and Kyparissia, the Greek National Road 74 run from Pyrgos to Tripoli via Olympia. The nearest airport is located in Andravida near the town of Amaliada but it is served for military operations only. However, there are plans to open passenger operations in the next years. The alternative airports for passenger operations are Araxos airport, located in the province of Aichaia about 60 km to the north-east or Kalamata Captain Vasilios Constatakopoulos airport, in Messinia province near Kalamata about 120 km south of the city.

==Education==
Department of Museum Studies of the university of Patras was based in the city.

<text>Epsom is a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located in the centre of the Auckland isthmus between Mount Eden and Greenlane, south of Newmarket, and south of the Auckland City Centre.

A valley located between four volcanic hills, Epsom was settled by Tāmaki Māori likely in the 13th or 14th centuries, becoming an are cultivated for Māori gardens due to the fertile volcanic soil. By the 17th and 18th centuries, Epsom was close to the centre of Waiohua, an influential union of Tāmaki Māori tribes, who focused life at Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill. Around the year 1741, conflict between iwi led to the area becoming a part of the rohe of Ngāti Whātua.

After the establishment of Auckland, Ngāti Whātua sold of land to the Crown, on which the village of Epsom was established in 1841. Epsom developed into an agricultural area during the 1840s and 1850s, and by the 1860s upper class members of Auckland society began establishing large country homes at Epsom. In 1903, a tramway was established in the suburb, and commercial villages developed in Epsom. By the 1920s, most of Epsom had been converted from farmland into suburban housing. From 1930 to 1989, eastern Epsom was the One Tree Hill Borough, a local government area independent from the City of Auckland.

Major features of the Epsom area include Cornwall Park, Greenlane Clinical Centre and Alexandra Park.

==Geography and definition==
Epsom is an inland suburb in the central Auckland isthmus. While the suburb has no concrete landmarks that differentiate Epsom from surrounding areas, Epsom is primarily a valley enclosed by four volcanoes of the Auckland volcanic field: Maungawhau / Mount Eden to the northwest, Tītīkōpuke / Mount Saint John to the northeast, Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill to the southeast and Te Tātua a Riukiuta / Three Kings to the southwest. Prior to European settlement, the Epsom valley was the location of numerous streams which flowed northwards towards the Waitematā Harbour. Since the 1960s, the corner of Manukau Road and Great South Road has popularly been understood as the beginning of Epsom.

Epsom is located between the suburbs of Mount Eden to the west, Newmarket to the north. Remuera to the east, and Three Kings to the southwest. The suburbs of One Tree Hill and Greenlane are found to the southeast, with Royal Oak to the south. Major arterial roads in Epsom include Manukau Road, which bisects the suburb and connects Newmarket to Royal Oak, Great South Road, a major road to the east of the suburb which links Newmarket to South Auckland, and Greenlane, a major east-west road across the isthmus. The Auckland Southern Motorway and Southern Line are located east of Epsom.

Greenwoods Corner is a small commercial village in southern Epsom, located at the crossroads of Manukau Road and Pah Road.

==Etymology==

The first references in newspapers to the Village of Epsom come from September 1841, when the first sections of land were sold at auction. The name was likely chosen to reference the Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey, England, famous for the Epsom Derby, as Epsom was chosen as one of the first locations where horse racing was held in New Zealand. The first races were advertised in September 1841, and held in November of the same year. Typically Robert Wynyard, superintendent of the Auckland Province, is identified as the person who chose the name Epsom, although this may be apocryphal.

While no traditional Tāmaki Māori names appear to refer to the Epsom valley, some traditional names include (&quot;The Pit of Rangi&quot;), located at the Great South Road and Manukau Road intersection, (&quot;The Spring of Rangi&quot;), located near the Mount Saint John Avenue and Manukau Road intersection, and (&quot;The Cave of Many Bats&quot;), located near Windmill Park.

==Natural history==
The Epsom area is primarily formed by volcanic soil modified into agricultural pasture, lying on top of Waitemata Group sandstone. Tītīkōpuke / Mount Saint John and Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill are the oldest of the Epsom area volcanoes, which are estimated to have erupted approximately 75,000 years and 67,000 years ago respectively. Te Tātua a Riukiuta / Three Kings last erupted an estimated 31,000 years ago. The youngest volcano in the Epsom area is Maungawhau / Mount Eden, which is estimated to have last erupted 28,000 years ago. To the southeast of Maungawhau / Mount Eden was Te Pou Hawaiki, a small scoria cone located at the modern-day site of the Auckland College of Education, which was quarried away. While there is no known estimate for how old Te Pou Hawaiki is, it is known to have erupted earlier than Maungawhau / Mount Eden.

The Epsom area is home to numerous lava caves, created by the eruptions of the five known volcanoes. Northern Epsom is the location of one of the rarest ecosystems in New Zealand, the Almorah Rock Forest. A soil-poor forest biome that developed on top of Maungawhau / Mount Eden scoria, the forest has reduced in size from to during human settlement of the Auckland isthmus.

==History==
===Māori history===
The Auckland isthmus has been settled by Māori since around the 13th or 14th centuries. The Epsom valley was likely an early sites of Māori agriculture. The wider area was devoted to the shifting cultivation of crops, primarily kūmara (sweet potato). The volcanic peaks of Maungawhau / Mount Eden, Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill, Tītīkōpuke / Mount Saint John were likely first settled around 1400AD, and an overland walking track () was created between the Waitematā and Manukau harbours, which later became Manukau Road.

Te Pou Hawaiki (a volcanic crater at the Auckland College of Education campus) was a traditionally important location, where a small pā known as was located. Soil from Hawaiki (the Māori homeland) was placed at the site during the early settlement period, and rituals were performed here prior to major hunting and fishing expeditions. A path known as (&quot;The Path of Single File&quot;) led between Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Te Pou Hawaiki. Additionally, Melville Park is a site where large stones had been placed by Tāmaki Māori.

In the 17th century, chief Hua Kaiwaka consolidated tribes on the isthmus as a confederation called Waiohua, a union which lasted for three generations until the early 18th century. During this period, thousands of people lived at fortified pā complexes on Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill,

The Te Taoū hapū of Ngāti Whātua defeated Kiwi Tāmaki, the paramount chief of Waiohua circa 1741, at a battle at Paruroa (Big Muddy Creek) in the lower Waitākere Ranges, under the leadership of Tuperiri. After Waiohua were defeated in a series of battles, some members of Te Taoū settled at Tāmaki Makaurau and intermarried with Waiohua, later becoming known as Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei. During this period, former agricultural areas on the isthmus began reforesting, due to the relatively smaller population of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, and Ngāti Whātua remained at Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill until the death of Tuperiri, around the year 1795.

Early contact with Europeans caused influenza outbreaks among Tāmaki Māori in 1793 and 1810. In late 1821 during the Musket Wars, a Ngāpuhi taua (war party) led by Hongi Hika attacked the Auckland isthmus settlements, leading to a period of time when the isthmus was mostly deserted, and Tāmaki Māori of the isthmus sheltered primarily to the south with Waikato Tainui relatives. Ngāti Whātua returned to the isthmus by the mid-1830s, resettling in the Māngere Bridge-Onehunga area.

===Early colonial period===

In 1840 after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, paramount chief Apihai Te Kawau made a &quot;tuku&quot; (strategic gift) of land at Waihorotiu on the Waitematā Harbour to William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, as a location for the capital of the colony to develop. This location became the modern city of Auckland, beginning with a port develop around Commercial Bay. In mid-1840, Apihai Te Kawau relocated the majority of the Ngāti Whātua from the Manukau Harbour to Remuera-Ōrākei on the Waitematā Harbour, closer to the new settlement of Auckland. Dual ports were created on either side of the isthmus the Port of Auckland on the Waitematā Harbour to the north of Epsom, and the Port of Onehunga on the Manukau Harbour, to the south.

In June 1841, the Crown purchased an additional of land south of Auckland from Apihai Te Kawau, much of which became the modern suburb of Epsom. The first farms in Epsom were subdivided and sold at auction in September 1841. As the first farms had been established later in that year, Epsom became one of the first European farming areas in New Zealand, and was quickly associated with horse racing events held on William Potter&#x27;s land in the vicinity of modern-day Alexandra Park. In addition to the Village of Epsom, more villages were established by property developers, including Kingsdown, Windsor, Anna and Maytown; although none of these became permanent names used by residents. The population of Epsom grew from 51 people in 1842 to 222 people in 1845.

Epsom struggled to grow as a community in the 1840s and 1850s, due to land speculators. Despite the volcanic soil of the area leading to productive farms, profits from subdividing and on selling the land without settling it often outweighed the cost and effort of establishing working farms. Early land owners of farms in the area included George Graham, William Potter, William Greenwood (namesake of Greenwoods Corner) and James Dilworth. Early farms grew crops such as wheat, oats, flax and barley. By the 1850s, wheat had become unprofitable, leading to the growth in potatoes as a crop, an areas being redeveloped for livestock, including cattle, sheep, horses, pigs and poultry.

Around the year 1843, a windmill was constructed in Epsom at the corner of Windmill Road and St Andrews road. The windmill primarily milled wheat, and Māori regularly brought corn to be milled at the windmill. As the windmill became less profitable the owners struggled financially, and resorted to taking Tāmaki Māori human remains from lava caves on Maungawhau / Mount Eden, and grinding these to make bone fertiliser. During the Invasion of the Waikato in the early 1860s, the Epsom windmill was converted into a defensive post for the surrounding area.

In 1846, the first church in the area, St Andrews, was constructed in Epsom. The Anglican church was later rebuilt in 1868.

===Upper class rural community===
By the 1860s, Epsom and Remuera had grown to become locations where upper class families of Auckland built country manors and large houses. Major figures who lived on properties at Epsom during this period included Thomas Gillies, Edwin Hesketh, David Murdoch, John Benjamin Russell, and John Logan Campbell. the latter of whom had an extensive farm on the northern slopes of Maungakiekie. Tensions existed between the farmers of Epsom and its upper class residents, many of whom complained about agricultural odours and practices.

Compared to surrounding areas close to Auckland, Epsom residents resisted urbanisation. Amenities arrived much later in Epsom than other areas close to Auckland: the post office only being established in 1877, Manukau Road upgrades occurring in 1882, gas street lighting in 1882 and the first school only opening in 1885. By the 1890s, Chinese market gardeners began leasing land in Epsom, the first of whom was Ming Quong, who leased from John Logan Campbell in 1892, establishing market gardens at the modern-day site of the Cornwall Cricket Club.

In 1890, the Costley Home for the Aged Poor was established at the modern-day site of Greenlane Clinical Centre.

In 1901, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall (King George V and Queen Mary of Teck) held a tour of New Zealand. During this visit, the Epsom Race Course was renamed Alexandra Park in honour of the Queen, Alexandra of Denmark, and Cornwall Park was formally opened, named after the Duke and Duchess. Cornwall Park was the former property of John Logan Campbell, who donated the lands to the City of Auckland.

===Epsom trams and suburbanisation===
The Epsom area gradually suburbanised in the 1900s and 1910s. In 1903, a tramway was established in Epsom, connecting Auckland City to Onehunga via Manukau Road, replacing the horse-drawn services that had been established along this route in 1888, and quickly becoming the major public transport used in the Epsom area. Two shopping villages developed in Epsom around the tram stops: the intersection of Greenlane and Manukau, and Greenwoods Corner.

The Epsom Showgrounds were first used to the Auckland agricultural show in 1911, later becoming a major venue for events in the 1910s. During World War I, Alexandra Park became the side of the Epsom Military Camp, where many soldiers were trained before deployment.

In 1923, a second tram route was established along Great South Road, leading to a third commercial centre in Epsom, at the intersection of Ranfurly Road and Great South Road.

The Ambury milk treatment factory was opened in Epsom in 1924. While the factory continued to operate until the early 1980s, the last farms in Epsom disappeared during the 1920s or early 1930s.

By the 1920s, Chinese-operated businesses began operating on Manukau Road, including laundries and greengrocers. Circa 1932, the first Indian greengrocer began operating in Epsom, when Gujarat immigrant Parbhu Kashanji began working at a store owned by his relative Naranji Daya.

Small industrial factories began operating in the Epsom area from the 1920s onwards. Frederick Porter&#x27;s Dye Works moved premises to Market Road in 1927, and the Swiss Laloli brothers established children&#x27;s furniture making business on Manukau Road in 1939. In 1941, the En-Ta Toys factory was established at Greenwoods Corner. Epsom residents often complained about the manufacturing odours, and the factory caught on fire twice in the 1940s. After the second fire, the Auckland City Council refused to allow the factory to be rebuilt.

===World War II===
During World War II, two companies of the New Zealand Home Guard were based in the Epsom area: the One Tree Hill A Company and Epsom Company Home Guard. Training exercises were held at the One Tree Hill domain by the Epsom Company Home Guard. In 1942, the Auckland Teachers Training College was requisitioned by the government, and used as an operational quarters for the military, and a bunker was constructed at the site to protect the operations centre in the event of an attack.

In 1942, the former Costley Home for the Aged Poor (renamed the Auckland Infirmary in 1924) was redeveloped as Green Lane Hospital, due to increased pressure at Auckland City Hospital during the war. Additionally, the United States Army constructed Cornwall Hospital to the north of Cornwall Park in 1943, to provide treatment for American soldiers injured in the Pacific War. Closing the following year, the hospital operated until 1975 as a maternity and geriatric hospital.

===Epsom in the 20th and 21st centuries===

The Epsom windmill was demolished in 1953. In 1956, the tram service along Manukau Road was closed down, replaced by trolleybuses.

In 1957, the Beth Shalom progressive Jewish synagogue was established on Manukau Road. Te Unga Waka Marae, a Catholic urban marae, was established on Manukau Road in 1966 by Whina Cooper and her nephew Pa Matiu.

In 1966, the Newmarket Viaduct of the Auckland Southern Motorway was constructed, marking the beginning of a gradually developing motorway system to the east of Epsom that linked the Auckland City Centre to South Auckland.

During the 1980s, the predominantly European demographics of Epsom began changing, as Asian communities settled in the suburb. Since the early 1990s there has been a considerable amount of &quot;infill&quot; housing with clutches of townhouses altering the streetscapes in some parts of Epsom. Properties in Epsom are often significantly more expensive compared to similar houses, due to Epsom being inside the school zones of many prestigious schools in central Auckland.

==Demographics==

==Notable features==
The Alexandra Park Raceway lies in the south-eastern quarter of Epsom where it is located next to the Epsom Showgrounds. The broad, flat pastureland here at the intersection of Green Lane West and Manukau Roads was used for sporting events from the 1850s onwards but the two venues were only formally established around 1900. The Alexandra Raceway was named after the Princess of Wales later Queen Alexandra. The Epsom Showgrounds host the annual Auckland Royal Easter Show.

The major road running through Epsom is Manukau Road. Manukau Road links central Auckland on the east coast with its airport and its west coast harbour, the port of neighbouring Onehunga. It was one of the 19th century&#x27;s main routes south from Auckland. The main route was Great South Road which forms Epsom&#x27;s north-eastern boundary with Remuera. The link to the Port of Onehunga meant Manukau Road became the route for horse buses, horse trams and, after 1902, electric trams. A large number of suburban houses and villas were built along it.

Several large residences were built in Epsom&#x27;s open country during the mid to late 19th century surrounded by large estates and smaller working farms. As these were subdivided towards the end of the 19th century the landscape changed dramatically. One major landowner, Dr John Logan Campbell, gave a large portion of his estate to the city and that is now Cornwall Park.

Epsom&#x27;s most notable parks and reserves are the volcanic cone of Mount Saint John and Marivare Reserve at the intersection of Manukau and Ranfurly Roads with a War Memorial in the form of an arch made of Volcanic rock together with sports grounds Melville Park and Windmill Park. As well as reserves located in Epsom itself the suburb is ringed with public parks often given to the city by Epsom residents.

To the west is Mt Eden with the Mount Eden Domain. To the east is Cornwall Park and One Tree Hill Domain.

==Notable buildings==

Due to the phenomenon of the &quot;Grammar Zone&quot;, parents wishing to live in-zone for Auckland Grammar and Epsom Girls&#x27; Grammar, housing in Epsom has become desirable and expensive. Houses within the Grammar Zone come with a premium of at least NZ$100,000 compared with an identical house just outside the Grammar Zone.

The University of Auckland Faculty of Education (formerly known as the Auckland College of Education) campus is also situated at this district.

As a branch of Auckland Libraries, Epsom Library is located on Manukau Road, one of the main roads of the Epsom suburb.

Carlson Cerebral Palsy School was founded in 1954, by the Auckland Education Board. They provided special schooling for children with cerebral palsy. The school was named after Dr. Earl Carlson who lived with cerebral palsy and visited New Zealand in 1948, where he educated the government on the condition and advocating for a space for students aged 3-18 years to obtain an education. The school celebrated its sixtieth jubilee in 2024.

==Politics==
=== Local government ===
The first local government in the area were highway and road board, which were established in the 1860s and 1870s. The Epsom Road Board operated from 1875 to 1917 around the Manukau Road area, but due to the late establishment of the board, many of the areas of modern Epsom were already part of the surrounding Newmarket, Mt Eden and One Tree Hill road boards. For much of its existence, the board met at the Newmarket Borough Council offices.

On 1 February 1917 the Epsom Road Board was dissolved, and the area was absorbed into Auckland City. In 1930, the area east of Manukau Road split from Auckland City to form the One Tree Hill Borough, while the area to the west remained under the control of the City of Auckland. In 1989, the One Tree Hill Borough was amalgamated into Auckland City. On 1 November 2010, the Auckland Council was formed as a unitary authority governing the entire Auckland Region, and most of Epsom become a part of the Albert-Eden local board area, administered by the Albert-Eden Local Board. Small areas of southern Epsom are a part of the Puketāpapa local board area, administered by the Puketāpapa Local Board.

The Albert-Eden and Puketāpapa local board areas form the Albert-Eden-Puketāpapa ward, which votes for two members of the Auckland Council.

====Mayors====
The One Tree Hill Borough had eight mayors during its existence:

=== National government ===

Epsom is also the name of an electorate that includes Epsom, Remuera, Parnell, Broadway Park, and part of Balmoral. Former Auckland Mayor Christine Fletcher, was elected as Member of Parliament for Epsom in 1996. This electorate is the wealthiest in the country, with an average income well above the national average.

The Epsom electorate has historically been a centre-right seat and, up until 2005, was considered a &#x27;safe&#x27; seat for the National Party. In 2005 the electorate elected the ACT candidate Rodney Hide, and the party has held the seat since then, in part to National softly endorsing the ACT candidates in the electorate in order for National to gain a list seat from the electorate.

The seat is currently held by David Seymour of the ACT Party. The suburb of Epsom comprises roughly 20% of the population of the Epsom electorate.

<text>The 1964 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL entry draft|amateur draft]] was the second NHL entry draft. It was a draft to assign unaffiliated amateur junior-age players to NHL teams. It was held at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec.

As was the case in the 1963 draft, amateur players turning 17 years of age between August 1, 1964, and July 31, 1965, were eligible, if they were not already sponsored by an NHL club.

The order of the draft followed the agreement reached in 1963, where the order was fixed as Red Wings, Bruins, Rangers, Black Hawks, Maple Leafs and Canadiens. Once again each team received four picks, each team having the right to forfeit their selection and pass it to the next team in the order. All picks were exercised this year.

Of the 24 players selected only nine played in the NHL. Syl Apps Jr., Jim Dorey, Tim Ecclestone and Mike Pelyk went on to have fruitful NHL careers, each playing well over 200 games a piece. However, the steal of this draft was the Bruins&#x27; third pick, 14th overall: Ken Dryden. Dryden made it known to the Bruins that he would elect to play at Cornell University, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, instead of turning professional. The Bruins traded his negotiation rights to the Canadiens, where he would play seven full seasons and part of an eighth, earning a Conn Smythe Trophy, Calder Memorial Trophy, five Vezina Trophies, five All-Star Game appearances, five First All-Star awards and six Stanley Cups.

<text>Fangliao Township is a rural township in Pingtung County, Taiwan.

==History==
In 1867, the village of &quot;Pangliau&quot; was located at the shore of a bay. American consul Charles Le Gendre, reporting on his 1867 visit to southern Formosa (see Formosa Expedition), wrote: &quot;The products are rice and peanuts. Women pound the rice and till the fields, while the men are entirely taken up with fishing.&quot; The high mountains to the east were the &quot;exclusive domain of the savage aborigines, who receive from the Chinese (or half-caste) population a certain share of their crops&quot;.

In 1875, Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen, who had been charged with making arrangements to prevent the Japanese from occupying Chinese districts, began introducing reforms in government. Pangliau was incorporated into Hengchun District, which was created from the portion of Fongshan District south of a river slightly north of Pangliau.

Pangliau, south of Takow (Kaohsiung), was the site where Japanese forces landed and completed the encirclement of Tainan during the 1895 Japanese invasion of Taiwan.

==Geography==
* Area: 
* Population: 22,717 (February 2024)

===Climate===

<text>Dolphins also known as a Dolphins in Phosphorescent Sea is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher. This work was first printed in February, 1923. Escher had been fascinated by the glowing outlines of ocean waves breaking at night and this image depicts the outlines made by a school of dolphins swimming and breaching ahead of the bow of a ship. The glow was created by bioluminescent dinoflagellates. (In 1923 the difference between phosphorescence and bioluminescence was not well understood.)

<text>Richard Wilhelm (10 May 18732 March 1930) was a German sinologist, theologian and missionary. He lived in China for 25 years, became fluent in spoken and written Chinese, and grew to love and admire the Chinese people. He is best remembered for his translations of philosophical works from Chinese into German that in turn have been translated into other major languages of the world, including English. His translation of the &quot;I Ching&quot; is still regarded as one of the finest, as is his translation of &quot;The Secret of the Golden Flower&quot;; both were provided with introductions by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who was a personal friend.

Lau Nui Suan introduced Wilhelm to Chinese yoga philosophy and the psychology of the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

His son Hellmut Wilhelm was also a sinologist, and was professor of Chinese at the University of Washington. Wilhelm was a close friend of the renowned Chinese educator and diplomat Dr. Li Linsi.

The Richard Wilhelm Translation Centre at Ruhr-Universität Bochum was founded in 1993 by Helmut Martin.

<text>Zhunan Township is an urban township in northern Miaoli County, Taiwan. Its city centre forms a continuous urban area with Toufen.

==Name==
Literally, &quot;Zhúnán&quot; () means &quot;bamboo south&quot; but in this context, &quot;zhú&quot; is short for &quot;Hsinchu&quot;. Thus, Zhunan lies south of Hsinchu (&quot;cf.&quot; Zhubei which lies north [&quot;běi&quot;] of Hsinchu). A previous name of the area was &quot;Tiong-káng&quot; (), literally &quot;central port&quot;, a name preserved in Zhonggang (), one of the 25 constituent villages of Zhunan. The present name was adopted under Japanese rule in 1920.

==Geography==
* Area: 
* Population: 89,420 (September 2023 estimate)

Zhunan was traditionally a beach and fishing community, and is closely associated with Goddess Mazu, who is the Goddess of Sea and Patron Deity of fishermen, sailors and any occupations related to sea/ocean. Zhunan&#x27;s main tourist attraction is its prominent Mazu Temples like Zhonggang Cihyu Temple and Hotsu Longfong Temple which has a statue of the Goddess that is over 100 feet tall.

Zhunan is now part of Taiwan&#x27;s computer sector and has a large Science Park.

Zhunan has wide open beaches and some cycling routes that run parallel to the beaches. Beach access was difficult until a bridge connecting the harbour and the beaches opened in 2008. It is a favourite spot among locals for surfing, kiteboarding, and windsurfing due to the year-round winds. Mountains overlook the town and are within a 20-minute drive.

<doc id="945762" wikidata="Q965835" url="?curid=945762" title="Gerard Kennedy">
<text>Gerard Michael Kennedy (born July 24, 1960) is a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as Ontario&#x27;s minister of Education from 2003 to 2006, when he resigned to make an unsuccessful bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. Kennedy previously ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, losing to future premier Dalton McGuinty on the final ballot. He also lost the 2013 Ontario Liberal leadership race, placing third.

While attending the University of Alberta in Edmonton, he became involved in the local food bank, eventually becoming its first executive director in 1983. In 1986, he moved to Toronto to run the Daily Bread Food Bank and did so until he entered politics, in 1996.

He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as an Ontario Liberal Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in a 1996 by-election to replace former premier Bob Rae in the York South constituency. In the 1999 and 2003 general elections, he was elected to represent the new Parkdale—High Park constituency. He became the province&#x27;s Minister of Education in 2003, serving in McGuinty&#x27;s first government.

In 2006, he resigned his cabinet post and then his legislative seat to seek the federal Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership. He finished third in delegate selection meetings, but at the leadership convention, he placed fourth on both the first and second ballot before withdrawing to support the eventual winner, Stéphane Dion.

In the 2008 federal election he ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the Parkdale—High Park electoral district and was elected as its Member of Parliament (MP). He ran for re-election in the 2011 federal election, but lost to former MP, Peggy Nash.

==Background==
Kennedy is one of six children born to Jack and Caroline Kennedy (née Shemanski). Kennedy&#x27;s father, descendant from Scottish ancestry originating in Cape Breton Island and the Ottawa Valley, ran a gas supply business in The Pas, Manitoba, eventually becoming that town&#x27;s mayor. His mother&#x27;s ancestry was Ukrainian, and her family lived in Canada&#x27;s Prairie region. At age 14, Kennedy moved to Winnipeg to attend St. John&#x27;s-Ravenscourt School on a hockey scholarship. After high school, he attended Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, also on a hockey scholarship. When Trent&#x27;s hockey program was cancelled, Kennedy switched education institutions and attended the University of Alberta to continue his undergraduate studies, but left in his fourth year, without completing his degree. He then worked as a historical researcher for the Government of Alberta in the early 1980s. He began his social activism career when he directed the volunteer program at an Edmonton Food Bank in 1983.

After moving to Ontario, Kennedy was the executive director of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Daily Bread Food Bank&quot; from 1986 to 1996. The food bank distributed $30 million worth of food each year without government funding; 150,000 people are estimated to have used its services every month. Kennedy was named in &quot;Toronto Life&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of fifty influential people in 1992, and was named newsmaker of the year by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; in 1993. Kennedy was also given an honourable mention in the &quot;Financial Post Magazine&quot;&#x27;s C.E.O. awards in 1995.

Kennedy is married to Jeanette Arsenault-Kennedy, a daycare professional and Acadian (Francophone) from Prince Edward Island. They have two children, daughter Théria and son John-Julien.

==Provincial politics==

===York South===
Kennedy entered political life in May 1996, running in a by-election for the Ontario legislature in Toronto&#x27;s York South constituency, which was vacated by former Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Bob Rae. On May 23, Kennedy was the first candidate not from the NDP or its predecessor, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, to win the seat since 1955. He received 7774 votes; his nearest opponent was the NDP&#x27;s David Miller, at the time, a Toronto city councillor, who received 6656 votes.

Despite being a newcomer to politics, Kennedy became the front-runner to replace Lyn McLeod as leader of the Ontario Liberal Party in late 1996. Although popular on the left-wing, he encountered a strong &quot;anyone-but-Kennedy&quot; movement from the party&#x27;s establishment and right-wing which was divided among several candidates on the leadership convention floor. Kennedy finished first on the first, second, third and fourth ballots, but was defeated on the fifth ballot by Dalton McGuinty. Although McGuinty finished in fourth place on the first ballot, he was able to increase his support in the subsequent ballots, gaining delegates from the candidates that dropped off. The results of the leadership contest did not prove divisive within the party and both rivals eventually became strong allies. Kennedy served as the party&#x27;s Health Critic during McGuinty&#x27;s first opposition term.

===Parkdale–High Park===
Kennedy wanted to run in the redistributed York South—Weston constituency in the 1999 Ontario provincial election because it contained most of his old York South constituency. However, he was persuaded to step aside for former leadership rival Joseph Cordiano. McGuinty&#x27;s policies dealing with redistribution and sitting MPPs gave the senior MPP first choice in a redistributed riding, and Cordiano was the more senior of the two (he had served since 1985). He instead ran in the neighbouring riding of Parkdale—High Park, which contained about one-fifth of his previous constituency, mostly the affluent Baby Point neighbourhood. He faced an interesting challenge from Annamarie Castrilli, another former Liberal leadership challenger who had defected to the governing Progressive Conservatives on the last sitting day of the legislature. Media reportage at the time anticipated that this would be a close race, due to the perceived relative strength of the three main parties being almost equally divided in this newly constituted constituency.

The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected, forming another majority government. Despite the Conservatives&#x27; good showing across the province, they did not win a single seat in the old City of Toronto area. Kennedy won his seat with large plurality, with his closest rival, Castrilli, about 10,000 votes behind. He became opposition critic for the high-profile Education portfolio.

===Minister of Education===
The Liberals won a majority in the 2003 Ontario provincial election, and Kennedy was re-elected in Parkdale-High Park with about 58 percent of the vote (his nearest opponent received 16 percent). He was appointed Minister of Education on October 23, 2003.

Under the two previous governments, the Education portfolio had been marked by considerable labour strife, due to either the austerity measure known as the Social Contract under the Bob Rae government, or school board restructuring under the Mike Harris government. In the spring of 2005, Kennedy announced the establishment of a provincial framework in teacher negotiations, which would see teachers&#x27; salaries increase by approximately 10.5 percent over four years in exchange for four years of labour peace. The framework included priorities such as workplace preparation courses and English as a Second Language programs.

On October 26, Kennedy was awarded the inaugural Ontario Student Trustees&#x27; Association &quot;Award of Distinction&quot; for his contributions to education, including his expansion of the role of student trustee.

==Federal politics==

===2006 federal Liberal leadership race===
On April 5, 2006 Kennedy resigned as Minister of Education to pursue the federal Liberal Leadership. Premier McGuinty, who admitted that finding a replacement was difficult, was reported to have set that day as a deadline for Kennedy to make a decision in order to prevent the leadership speculation from overshadowing the Ontario government&#x27;s agenda. Kennedy formally declared his candidacy in front of the House of Commons in Ottawa, on April 27, 2006.

On May 18, Kennedy formally resigned from the provincial legislature. His resignation came after several weeks of criticism over drawing an MPP&#x27;s salary, despite his absence from the legislature and his stated intention to live for part of the summer in Quebec. Kennedy responded saying that he intended to resign his seat &quot;sooner rather than later,&quot; but first wanted to finish some local projects he&#x27;d been working on.

On August 16, Premier McGuinty called a by-election to replace Kennedy in Parkdale–High Park for September 14. The centre-left leaning riding was arguably held in part thanks to Kennedy&#x27;s personal popularity (due to his work as food bank director and education minister) versus that of his party; Sylvia Watson could not retain the seat for the Liberals in the subsequent by-election, apparently being unable to &quot;ride the coattails of Kennedy&#x27;s popularity&quot;.

The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Gerard Kennedy appeared to have signed up more new members than any other candidate during the member recruitment period. The article stated that it had been &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; that Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae were the leaders in the race but Kennedy&#x27;s numbers indicated that it was a wide-open race.

On September 8, Joe Fontana, MP for London North Centre and Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s Ontario Co-Chair, announced that he would be resigning his seat in the House of Commons to run for mayor in London; and, it was speculated Kennedy would run in the by-election, which he did not.

On &quot;Super Weekend&quot;, from September 29 to October 1, the Liberal Party elected approximately 85% of delegates. Kennedy finished in third place with 17.3% of delegates being pledged to his campaign, a similar number to Stéphane Dion, who received 16.0% and to Bob Rae who received 20.3%. Besides sizable delegate support he was supported also by 20 MPs and former MPs, with about a dozen Ontario MPPs.

On November 27, Kennedy attracted media attention when he became the first leadership candidate to oppose a motion being debated in the House of Commons of Canada, that would have declared the Québécois &quot;a nation within a united Canada&quot;. Kennedy was joined in that position later that day by fellow candidates Ken Dryden and Joe Volpe.

At the convention, Dion placed higher than Kennedy in the first ballot voting, finishing ahead of Kennedy by two votes–17.8% to 17.7%). That gap increased to 2% after the second ballot–20.8% to 18.8%. Kennedy chose to leave the ballot before he would have been forced to, and supported Dion. Earlier, the two leadership contenders had allegedly struck a pact in which the first off the ballot would throw his support to the other. Pundits said that this surprise move had caught the Ignatieff and Rae strategists off guard. Kennedy delivered his delegates extraordinarily &quot;en masse&quot;, as Dion&#x27;s support increased to 37.0% on the third ballot, moving from third place to first and eliminating Rae. Dion retained the position for the fourth and decisive ballot which resulted in him winning the leadership.

===Post-leadership race===
On December 19, 2006, Dion announced that Kennedy would be his special adviser on election readiness and renewal with &quot;intimate involvement in all aspects of election readiness and the platform. Kennedy was also the chair of the mentorship committee. Kennedy said that his duties as election readiness adviser ended in the summer of 2007, but he continued as a special adviser to Stéphane Dion, appeared regularly as a strategist for the Liberals on television and was often quoted as a Liberal spokesman in newspapers.

In late August 2007, Kennedy entered the academic world accepting a position at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Ryerson University. He served a one-year term as a Distinguished Visiting Professor until September 2008.

In late September 2007, Kennedy was part of a group observing Ukraine&#x27;s parliamentary elections in the Mariupol electoral commission. Kennedy reported back to the Canadian media that the group he was a party to was confronted by Ukrainian police who stripped passports and observer statuses. Kennedy said that the police were interfering in the process, and the observer group felt intimidated by the police who carried weapons and followed the group around for a day. Kennedy concluded that there were major flaws in the voting process, as the group was also witness to extra ballots being distributed.

===2008 election in Parkdale–High Park===

On February 6, 2007, Kennedy confirmed that he would seek the Liberal nomination for Parkdale—High Park in the next federal election. At the time, the electoral district was represented by New Democrat Peggy Nash. Kennedy won the nomination by acclamation on April 24, 2007.

On March 31, 2008, although he was not a member of the House of Commons of Canada, Kennedy was appointed to the Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet by leader Stéphane Dion. Kennedy served as Intergovernmental Affairs critic, which gave him responsibility to speak on behalf of the Liberal Party on matters of federal-provincial relations.

In the October 2008 federal election, Kennedy defeated Nash by over 3300 votes, or roughly by a seven percent margin. He was mentioned as a possible candidate in the 2008/09 Liberal leadership race, but eventually decided to pass on another leadership run.

===War resisters bill===

On September 17, 2009, Kennedy tabled a private member&#x27;s bill in the House of Commons. The bill would change provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to provide sanctuary in Canada for American and other countries&#x27; war resisters on moral, political or religious grounds.

===2011 election in Parkdale–High Park===
In 2011, Kennedy sought re-election to his Parkdale–High Park seat against Peggy Nash in a rematch of the 2008 campaign. The campaign was heated at times, and on election night, harnessing the NDP&#x27;s unprecedented levels of support, Nash defeated him to regain her old seat.

==2013 Ontario Liberal leadership race==

On November 12, 2012, Kennedy announced that he was seeking the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party to replace Dalton McGuinty.

At his campaign launch in London, Kennedy criticized the government&#x27;s Bill 115 to ban teacher&#x27;s strikes and freeze wages. Of the seven candidates, Kennedy has said he would consider repealing the bill.

Former Liberal MPP Steve Peters gave his endorsement at the launch. On November 16, 2012, he gained the formal support of former cabinet minister George Smitherman and Joseph Cordiano On November 21, 2012, Niagara Falls MPP Kim Craitor endorsed Kennedy. Kennedy has also gained the support of MPP&#x27;s Bob Delaney,and Shafiq Qaadri.

Early polls placed Kennedy ahead of other candidates to replace Premier McGuinty, helped by his name recognition from his federal and provincial work, and his role as director of the Food Bank. In a poll of Ontarion released on November 29, 2012 by Forum Research, 37% said they would support Kennedy, followed by Sandra Pupatello (23%), Kathleen Wynne (19%), Eric Hoskins (7%), Glen Murray (6%), and Charles Sousa (4%). Among Liberal voters, Kennedy scored first with 38% support.

After the second ballot, in which he placed third with 13.7% of the vote, Kennedy dropped out and endorsed the eventual winner, Wynne, who went on to become Premier of Ontario.

==Private sector==
Since February 2013, Kennedy has been CEO of Alpha Healthcare/Alpha Laboratories. He had previously served as a consultant to the company while serving as a Member of Parliament.

<doc id="945767" wikidata="Q7764340" url="?curid=945767" title="The Simple Art of Murder">
<text>The Simple Art of Murder is the title of several quasi-connected publications by hard-boiled detective fiction author Raymond Chandler:

*The first, and arguably best-known, is a critical essay on detective fiction, originally published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in December 1944. A revised, expanded version was included in Howard Haycraft&#x27;s 1946 anthology &quot;The Art of the Mystery Story&quot;.
*The second is a separate, shorter essay, mostly describing Chandler&#x27;s personal experiences writing for pulp magazines, originally published in &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot;, April 15, 1950.
*The third is a short story collection, also originally published in 1950 (by Houghton Mifflin Co.), which contains eight of Chandler&#x27;s stories pre-dating his first novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, that he wanted remembered.
**While first editions of this collection feature an abridgement of the &quot;Saturday&quot; essay as an introduction and the &quot;Atlantic&quot; essay as an afterword, later editions tend to feature the &quot;Atlantic&quot; essay as the introduction and relegate the &quot;Saturday&quot; essay to other collections, most commonly &quot;Trouble Is My Business&quot;.

The &quot;Atlantic&quot; essay is considered a seminal piece of literary criticism. Although Chandler&#x27;s primary topic is the art (and failings) of contemporary detective fiction, he touches on general literature and modern society as well.

The opening statement – &quot;Fiction in any form has always intended to be realistic&quot; – places Chandler in a lineage with earlier American Realists, in particular Mark Twain and his critique of James Fenimore Cooper, &quot;Fenimore Cooper&#x27;s Literary Offenses&quot;. Chandler dissects A. A. Milne&#x27;s &quot;The Red House Mystery&quot; much as Twain tears apart Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Deerslayer&quot;, namely by revealing what is ignored, brushed over, and unrealistic. &quot;If the situation is false,&quot; Chandler writes, &quot;you cannot even accept it as a light novel, for there is no story for the light novel to be about.&quot; He expands his criticism to the bulk of detective fiction, especially of the English variety which he complains is preoccupied with &quot;hand-wrought dueling pistols, curare and tropical fish.&quot; In addition to Milne, Chandler confronts Dame Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, E. C. Bentley, and Freeman Wills Crofts. &quot;The English may not always be the best writers in the world, but they are incomparably the best dull writers.&quot; Chandler&#x27;s critique of the &quot;classic&quot; Golden Age detective story goes beyond a lack of realistic characters and plot; Chandler complains about contrivances and formulas and an inability to move beyond them. The classic detective story &quot;has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.&quot;

Chandler reserves his praise for Dashiell Hammett. Although Chandler and Hammett were contemporaries and grouped as the founders of the hard-boiled school, Chandler speaks of Hammett as the &quot;one individual... picked out to represent the whole movement,&quot; noting Hammett&#x27;s mastery of the &quot;American language&quot;, his adherence to reality, and that he &quot;gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it for reasons, not just to provide a corpse.&quot;

Chandler concludes his essay by moving from reality in literature to reality itself, &quot;a world in which gangsters can rule nations and almost rule cities... it is not a fragrant world, but it is the world you live in.&quot; He concludes by outlining his conception (and that of Hammett) of the central character of all detective fiction, the detective himself – a man who provides the contrast to the seediness and immorality in the universe of the &quot;realist&quot; fiction he&#x27;s championing – &quot;down these mean streets must go a man who is not himself mean...He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor—by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it.&quot; This man must have a keen sense of justice, but not wear it on his sleeve yet not allow it to be corrupted.

==References in other work==

The Geraldine McEwan telemovie based on Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel &quot;The Murder at the Vicarage&quot; shows Miss Marple reading Chandler&#x27;s book. Early in the telemovie Miss Marple says, &quot;There is never anything simple about murder.&quot;

The closing lines of the essay, setting his vision of corruption in the world against the possibility of an uncorrupted man, has been quoted often – as the title of the book &quot;Down These Mean Streets&quot; and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movie &quot;Mean Streets.&quot;

<doc id="945768" wikidata="Q2899660" url="?curid=945768" title="Castrovalva (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Castrovalva is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher, first printed in February 1930. Like many of Escher&#x27;s early works, it depicts a place that he visited on a tour of Italy.

It depicts the Abruzzo village of Castrovalva, which lies at the top of a sheer slope. The perspective is toward the northwest, from the narrow trail on the left which, at the point from which this view is seen, makes a hairpin turn to the right, descending to the valley. In the foreground at the side of the trail, there are several flowering plants, grasses, ferns, a beetle and a snail. In the expansive valley below there are cultivated fields and two more towns, the nearest of which is Anversa degli Abruzzi, with Casale in the distance.

==In popular culture==

*In 1982 the name &quot;Castrovalva&quot; was used in a story in the BBC television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The storyline also relied heavily on recursion, a favorite theme in Escher&#x27;s later and more famous works, and used ideas taken from &quot;Belvedere&quot;, &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot;, and &quot;Relativity&quot; to trap the protagonists in the city of Castrovalva. 
*The comic &quot;Kingdom of the Wicked&quot; is set in an imaginary world named Castrovalva.

<text>Discovery Zone (DZ) was an American chain of entertainment facilities featuring games and elaborate indoor mazes designed for young children, including roller slides, climbing play structures, and ball pits. It also featured arcade games. A talking robot character named Z-Bop served as mascot to the chain. Ronald Matsch, Jim Jorgensen and Dr. David Schoenstadt founded Discovery Zone in 1989, with the first location opening in Kansas City, Missouri, in October 1989. An early investor in and vocal supporter of the company was tennis player Billie Jean King.

Discovery Zone became the first corporate sponsor of the PBS children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1998, ending a 29-year long streak without on-air support from them.

On February 7, 2020, a new center using the Discovery Zone name opened in the Cincinnati suburb of Union Township, Ohio at the Eastgate Mall; it is not affiliated with the original company, but is heavily inspired by it. A second location was added in Florence, Kentucky, at the Florence Mall on July 23, 2021.

==History ==

Founded in 1989, Discovery Zone grew quickly, opening 15 stores in 18 months. In April 1993, Blockbuster Video invested $10.3 million (~$ in ) into Discovery Zone to purchase 20% of the company with an option to increase its stake to 50.1 percent in June 1994.

In June 1993, Discovery Zone went public on the NASDAQ exchange, raising $55 million (~$ in ) on the IPO. The stock rose 61% in the first day of trading.

Under the leadership of then CEO Don Flynn, in July 1994, Discovery Zone bought 45 Leaps and Bounds stores from McDonald&#x27;s for $111 million in stock and 57 franchised stores from Blockbuster Video for $91 million in stock bringing the total stores to almost 300. At the same time, Blockbuster bought more shares of Discovery Zone giving it 50.1% of the stock.

Blockbuster took total management control of Discovery Zone in April 1995. Viacom had plans to cross market Discovery Zone with its other businesses, such as Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures, and Showtime. By the time Viacom took control of Discovery Zone, the company signed a deal with Saban Entertainment to include characters from the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; television series at the play centers. Discovery Zone had also planned a new family entertainment center to compete against Dave &amp; Buster’s, which was dubbed “Metro Zone”. The new complexes would have included dining, drinking, mini golf and VR games in addition to the indoor playground equipment that Discovery Zone is known for.

Stretched thin by expansion, changes in management tried to save the company; however, Discovery Zone filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 26, 1996, in Wilmington, Delaware, with debts of up to $366.8 million. They emerged a year later on July 30, under the private ownership of Wellspring Associates LLC.

Wellspring Associates invested $20 million towards improving Discovery Zone&#x27;s fun centers starting in 1998. The size of the &quot;Mega Zone&quot; play structure and toddler play area were decreased to make room for a sports challenge area and laser tag area themed to third-party properties and a karaoke stage, while arts &amp; crafts activities were placed in the former Quiet Zone.

On April 20, 1999, Discovery Zone, Inc. re-entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Discovery Zone abruptly closed 106 of its locations on June 25, unable to alert visitors with reserved parties, while its remaining 22 locations closed throughout 1999. Twenty of the latter locations (thirteen owned and seven leased) and the company&#x27;s intellectual properties and trade names were sold to CEC Entertainment, Inc., owner of Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s, who attempted to accommodate last minute party reschedulings over the following days. Ten locations were converted to Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s while the others were sold to third-parties.

In June 2000, Discovery Zone&#x27;s bankruptcy court judge ruled that there was no feasible way for the company to be profitable, and their bankruptcy was converted into liquidation. By the end of 2001, Discovery Zone was out of business completely.

<text>An earplug is a device that is inserted in the ear canal to protect the user&#x27;s ears from loud noises, intrusion of water, foreign bodies, dust or excessive wind. Earplugs may be used as well to improve sleep quality or focus in noisy environments. Since they reduce the sound volume, earplugs may prevent hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing of the ears), in some cases. 

US Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires hearing conservation programs which include the provision of hearing protection devices (HPDs). But this does not mean that OSHA considers HPDs to be effective.

==History==
The first recorded mention of the use of earplugs is in the Greek tale &quot;Odyssey,&quot; wherein Odysseus&#x27;s crew is warned about the Sirens that sing from an island they will sail past. Circe, their hostess, tells them of the Sirens&#x27; bewitching song that makes men drive their boats ashore and perish. She advised Odysseus to fashion earplugs for his men from beeswax so they would not be lured to their deaths by the sirens&#x27; song.

In 1907, the German company Ohropax, which would produce mainly wax earplugs, was started by the German inventor Max Negwer. Ray and Cecilia Benner invented the first moldable pure silicone ear plug in 1962. These earplugs were valued by swimmers because of their waterproof qualities, as well as those trying to avoid harmful noise. Ray Benner, who was a Classical musician, bought McKeon Products in 1962. At that time, the company&#x27;s sole product was Mack&#x27;s Earplugs (named after the original owner), which was a moldable clay earplug. The Benners quickly redesigned the product to a silicone version, which would become known as Mack&#x27;s Pillow Soft Earplugs.

Present-day earplug material was discovered in 1967, at National Research Corporation (NRC) in the US by Ross Gardner Jr. and his team. As part of a project on sealing joints, they developed a resin with energy absorption properties. They came to call this material &quot;E-A-R&quot; (Energy Absorption Resin). In 1972 the material was refined into commercial memory foam earplugs, made from either polyvinyl chloride or polyurethane.

== Hearing protection ==

There are mainly four types of earplug fittings for hearing protection:

* Foam earplugs, mainly made from either polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU) (memory foam), which are compressed (rolled) and put into the ear canal, where they expand to plug it.
* Wax earplugs, which are rolled into a ball and carefully molded to fit over the external portion of the ear canal.
* Flanged silicone earplugs, an example of Universal-fit.
* Custom molded earplugs, made from a mold of the wearer&#x27;s ear and designed to precisely fit all ear canal shapes. Custom molded is further divided into laboratory-made and &quot;formed in place&quot;.

NIOSH Mining Safety and Health Research recommends using the roll, pull, and hold method when using memory foam earplugs. The process involves the user rolling the earplug into a thin rod, pulling back on the ear, and holding the earplug deep in the ear canal with the finger. To get a complete seal, the user must wait about 20 to 30 seconds for the earplug to expand inside the canal.

Earplugs are most effective when the wearer has been properly trained on use and insertion. Employers can provide this training before dispensing earplugs to their employees. Training for earplug use includes: insertion, a seal check, depth check, removal, cleaning, and replacement. When training on insertion, the objective is for the worker to understand the correct insertion strategy. Proper insertion training prevents inadequate insertion, that can result in discomfort or inadequate attenuation, which can result in hearing loss. When this step is achieved, then the seal and depth need to be checked. The ear plugs all have a desired depth and seal which need to be achieved to provide the designated attenuation for the wearer. The worker will also be trained on how to properly remove the earplugs and clean them. This allows for multiple uses and reduces the chance of infection. To further prevent infection, it is important the worker understands when they will need to replace their earplugs. Once the plugs have been worn down from repeated use, they will no longer seal correctly or provide the proper attenuation level, and the device will need to be replaced.

Noise attenuation can be verified using real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) or microphone in the real ear (MIRE) methods. The difference in thresholds with and without the hearing protection in place determines the amount of attenuation (REAT). Two microphones measure the sound pressure (of test signals, or noise in the workplace during a shift) outside the HPD and inside, and the difference shows the noise attenuation (MIRE).

Earplugs and other hearing protection devices can be tested to ensure that they fit properly and are successfully limiting sound exposure, which is called fit-testing. There are a number of different fit-testing systems, also known as field attenuation estimation systems (FAES). These use large headphones or specialized (surrogate) earplugs to transmit the test sounds and measure the attenuation provided by the hearing protector. These systems include the NIOSH HPD Well-Fit, Honeywell Howard Leight VeriPRO, 3MEARFit and many others. 


==Types and use cases==
The diameter of the ear canals can be from 3 to 14 mm. They can be round, elliptical, and even slit-like. The ear canals may be straight, but more often curved to varying degrees. The shape and size of the right and left ear canals for the same worker can vary significantly. Installing the earplugs neatly and tightly (without gaps) can be a difficult task. 

Since the fitting of the earplugs greatly affects their noise attenuation, various designs of these personal protective equipment have been developed.

===Simple earplugs===
Basic foam style earplug protection is often worn by industrial workers who work within hearing distance of loud machinery for long periods of time, and is used by the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) for soldiers to use when firing weapons. Earplugs are rated for their ability to reduce noise; see .


Most disposable earplugs are elastic ones made of memory foam, that is typically rolled into a tightly compressed cylinder (without creases) by the user&#x27;s fingers and then inserted in the ear canal. Once released, the earplug expands until it seals the canal, blocking the sound vibrations that could reach the eardrum. Other disposable plugs simply push into the ear canal without being rolled first. Sometimes earplugs are connected with a cord to keep them together when not in use. Other common material bases for disposable earplugs are viscous wax or silicone.

Other devices that provide hearing protection include electronic devices worn around and/or in the ear, and are designed to cancel out the loud noise of a gunshot, while possibly amplifying quieter sounds to normal levels. While rich in features, these electronic devices are more expensive, compared to their foam counterparts.

In other activities, hobby motorcyclists and skiers may also choose to use decibel reduction earplugs, to compensate for the ongoing noise of the wind against their head or helmet.

=== Musicians&#x27; earplugs ===
Musicians are exposed to potentially harmful levels of sound, which can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, and other auditory symptoms. Because of this, musicians may choose to use earplugs.

Musician&#x27;s earplugs (also called Hi-Fi or Lossless earplugs) are designed to attenuate sounds evenly across all frequencies (pitches) which helps maintain the ear&#x27;s natural frequency response and thus minimizes the effect on the user&#x27;s perception of timbre (frequency spectrum, f.ex. bass and treble levels). These are commonly used by musicians and technicians, both in the studio and in concert, to avoid overexposure to high volume levels. Musician&#x27;s earplugs generally achieve a more natural frequency response by incorporating a small diaphragm or membrane together with acoustic channels and damping materials. Simpler variants with only a small hole introduce a low frequency leak, and will not achieve a flat frequency response. Examples of manufacturers of membrane-based earplugs are ACS, Etymotic and Minuendo.

Preformed earplugs, such as the ER-20 earplug are universal (non-custom) earplugs with a noise reduction rating (NRR) of about 12 dB. A selection of musician&#x27;s earplugs have been reviewed by the National Acoustic Laboratories and The HEARing CRC in conjunction with Choice. The review results (which include attenuation measures and user ratings of comfort, fit and sound quality) are available at What Plug?.

A more expensive option is the custom molded musician&#x27;s earplug, which is custom-made for the individual listener. These earplugs are typically made out of silicone or vinyl materials and come with a vent and a variety of filters that can change the amount of attenuation provided. Common static filter attenuation levels are 9, 15, and 25 dB. This type of plug is quite popular among audio engineers who can safely listen to loud mixes for extended periods of time. However, they can be quite costly, being intended for constant re-use unlike simple earplugs which are disposable.


Alternately, musicians may use in-ear monitors, which are essentially headphones that also serve as earplugs by attenuating surrounding sound. In order for in-ear monitors to double up as hearing protection, custom earpieces should be used. The process for having custom earpieces made is similar to that of the custom musician&#x27;s earplug and, similarly, the earpiece will be made of silicone or vinyl. While using an in-ear monitor can help protect hearing, the amount of protection provided by the monitor depends on the listening level that the musician chooses. Because of this, if the musician sets the monitor to a high level, the monitor may attenuate surrounding sound while still providing a potentially harmful level of sound directly to the musician&#x27;s ear and therefore no longer serve a protective function.

Several earplugs on the market claim to be for musicians, but are not in fact by definition a musician&#x27;s earplug. By having a thin acoustical bypass channel, they allow for a slightly better frequency response and lower attenuation than simple earplugs, but far from the level of fidelity that membrane-based earplugs provide. These types of earplugs do not provide the flat attenuation that is characteristic of a musician&#x27;s plug, but may still be useful for some, due to their lower price points.

===Custom molds===
Earplugs can be molded to fit an individual&#x27;s ear canal. This costs more, but can improve fit for the few percent that have an ear anatomy outside the norm.

Custom molded earplugs fall into two categories: Laboratory made and Formed in Place. Laboratory made requires an impression to be made by a professional of the ear canal and outer ear. The impression is sent to a laboratory to be checked and made into a hearing protector. Formed in place uses the same process to make an impression of the ear canal and outer ear and then turns that impression into the protector. Both types of custom molded earplugs are non-disposable with the laboratory made typically lasting for 3 – 5 years and the formed in place lasting for 1 – 2 years.

For the best attenuation and proper fit, the impressions for custom molds must meet a desired criteria by the manufacturer of the mold. Before an impression can be taken for the custom mold the ear canal is checked for any wax or physical abnormalities. This is important in making sure there is a proper seal with the impression material and also not to push any wax deep into the canal. The otoblock (made with foam or cotton) will be inserted deep in the canal to prevent the impression material from going too far. The impression material (either silicone or powder/liquid) will be placed into the ear canal. This will need to be fully made, making sure there are no gaps or creases in the impression. If there are, then the mold made from the impression will not adequately seal the ear canal. Once the custom mold is made, it will need to be inspected by the Audiologist for proper fit on the patient. Hearing protection should also be verified using real-ear methods to ensure proper attenuation. Real-ear attentuation at threshold (REAT) measurements test how narrowband noises of varying frequency are attenuated with and without the custom mold in place. Testing for low-frequency attenuation can help to verify the earmold fit while testing high-frequency attenuation can verify the properties of the filter used.

For best results they are molded in the ear while in the position that they will be used. For instance, if they are to be used for sleeping then they should be molded in the ear while lying down, as different positioning of the jaws causes significant changes to the form of the ear canal, mostly a reduction of the diameter, risking the sleep earplug to be made too large otherwise. It is also important that during the impression process that a music performer use their embouchure or move the jaw to mimic singing in order to account for ear canal changes during performance. Therefore, if the impression is not properly constructed, then it will need to be redone. These changes can be felt by feeling with a finger just at the entrance to the ear canal while moving the jaws sideways, up and down or anterior and posterior.

Most molded earplugs are made from silicone but other materials may be used, including thermoplastics, plastic, nylon and even 3-D printed earplugs.

===Electronic earplugs===
The noise reduction of passive earplugs varies with frequency but is largely independent of level (soft noises are reduced as much as loud noises). As a result, while loud noises are reduced in level, protecting hearing, it can be difficult to hear low level noises. Active electronic earplugs exist, where loud noises are reduced more than soft noises, and soft sounds may even be amplified, providing dynamic range compression. This is done by having a standard passive earplug, together with a microphone/speaker pair (microphone on outside, speaker on inside; formally a pair of transducers), so sound can be transmitted without being attenuated by the earplug. When external sounds exceed an established threshold (typically 82 dBA SPL), the amplification of the electronic circuit is reduced. At very high levels, the amplification is turned off automatically and you receive the full attenuation of the earplug just as if it were turned off and seated in the ear canal. This protects hearing, but allows one to hear normally when sounds are in safe ranges – for example, have a normal conversation in a low-noise situation, but be protected from sudden loud noises, for example at a construction site or a while hunting.

===Nonlinear earplugs===
Nonlinear earplugs provide similar advantages to electronic earplugs but do not require electricity. They are designed with a thin diaphragm which allows the amount of noise reduction to increase in proportion to the sound level to which the wearer is exposed. This makes them useful for applications where situational awareness is required but noise protection is also necessary, such as the military or police.

===Sleep===
Earplugs for sleeping are made to be as comfortable as possible while blocking external sounds that may prevent or disrupt sleep. Specialized earplugs for such noises as a partner&#x27;s snoring may have sound-dampening enhancements that enable the user to still hear other noises, such as an alarm clock.

To determine the comfort of earplugs used for sleeping, it is important to try them on while actually lying down. The pressure on the ear between the head and pillow may cause significant discomfort. Furthermore, just tilting the head back or to the side causes significant anatomical changes in the ear canal, mostly a reduction of the ear canal diameter, which may reduce comfort if the earplug is too large. Earplugs for sleeping may enhance recovery after major surgery. 
===Protection from water===
Some earplugs are primarily designed to keep water out of the ear canal, especially during swimming and water sports. This type of earplug may be made of wax or moldable silicone which is custom-fitted to the ear canal by the wearer.

Exostosis, or surfer&#x27;s ear, is a condition which affects people who spend large amounts of time in water in cold climates. In addition, wind may increase the prevalence of the amount of exostosis seen in one ear versus the other dependent on the direction it originates from and the orientation of the individual to the wind. Custom-fitted surfer&#x27;s earplugs help reduce the amount of cold water and wind that is allowed to enter the external ear canal and, thus, help slow the progression of exostosis.

Another condition is otitis externa, which is an infection of the outer ear canal. This form of infection differs from those commonly occurring in children behind the eardrum, which is otitis media, or a middle ear infection. This infection&#x27;s symptoms include: itchiness, redness, swelling, pain upon tugging of the pinna, or drainage. To protect from this form of infection, it is important to thoroughly dry the ears after exposing them to water with a towel. To protect the ears during exposure, the individual can use a head cap, ear plugs, or custom-fitted swim molds.

A 2003 study published in &quot;Clinical Otolaryngology&quot; found that a cotton ball saturated with petroleum jelly was more effective at keeping water out of the ear, was easier to use, and was more comfortable than wax plugs, foam plugs, EarGuard, or Aquafit.

Jacques-Yves Cousteau warned that earplugs are harmful to divers, especially scuba divers. Scuba divers breathe compressed air or other gas mixtures at a pressure matching the water pressure. This pressure is also inside the ear, but not between the eardrum and the earplug, so the pressure behind the eardrum will often burst the eardrum. Skin divers have less pressure inside the ears, but they also have only atmospheric pressure in the outer ear canal. The PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) advises in the &quot;Open Water Diver Manual&quot; that only vented earplugs designed for diving should be used in diving.

===Flight ear protection===
Earplugs are also available which help to protect ears from the pain caused by airplane cabin pressure changes. Some products contain a porous ceramic insert which reportedly aids equalization of air pressure between the middle and outer ear thereby preventing pain during landings and take-offs. Some airlines distribute regular foam earplugs as part of their amenity kits for passengers to aid their comfort during landings and takeoffs as well as to reduce exposure to the aircraft&#x27;s noise during the flight. These can help passengers get to sleep during the flight if desired.

== Noise attenuation, labeled (NRR, SNR, HML, SLC80) and real-world ==
In the past, experts believed that HPDs noise attenuation in laboratories and workplaces were similar. Therefore, they developed different methods for predicting noise attenuation at the workplaces using lab data. Later, derating methods were developed. Many of these methods have been preserved in various regulatory documents and older standards.

Unfortunately, all these methods and derating do not take into account at all and are not able to take into account the strong individual variability in noise attenuation in principle, for example, plus or minus 20 decibels.

New standards have been developed that better correspond to the current level of science.

=== Rating ===

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates that hearing protection is rated and labeled. To be rated, hearing protection is tested under ANSI S3.19-1974 to provide a range of attenuation values at each frequency that can then be used to calculate a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR). Under this standard a panel of ten subjects are tested three times each in a laboratory to determine the attenuation over a range of 9 frequencies.

In the European Union, hearing protectors are required to be tested according to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) acoustical testing standard, ISO 4869 Part 1 and the Single Number Rating (SNR) or High/Middle/Low (HML) ratings are calculated according to ISO 4869 Part 2. In Brazil, hearing protectors are tested according to the American National Standards Institute ANSI S12.6-1997 and are rated using the Noise Reduction Rating Subject Fit NRR(SF). Australia and New Zealand have different standards for protector ratings yielding a quantity SLC80 (Sound Level Class for the 80th percentile). Canada implements a class system for rating the performance of protectors. Gauger and Berger have reviewed the merits of several different rating methods and developed a rating system that is the basis of a new American National Standard, ANSI S12.68-2007

The various methods have slightly different interpretations, but each method has a percentile associated with the rating. That percent of the users should be able to achieve the rated attenuation. For instance, the NRR is determined by the mean attenuation minus two standard deviations. Thus, it translates to a 98% statistic. That is, at least 98 percent of users should be able to achieve that level of attenuation. The SNR and HML are a mean minus one standard deviation statistic. Therefore, approximately 86% of the users should be able to achieve that level of protection. Similarly, the NRR (SF) is a mean minus one standard deviation and represents an 86% of users should achieve that level of protection. The difference between the ratings lies in how the protectors are tested. NRR is tested with an experimenter-fit protocol. SNR/HML are tested with an experienced subject-fit protocol. NRR (SF) is tested with a naive subject-fit protocol. According to Murphy, et al. (2004), these three protocols will yield different amounts of attenuation with the NRR being the greatest and NRR (SF) being the least.

The experimenter-fit NRR should be adjusted per the guidelines of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as the required NRR ratings differ greatly from lab tests to field tests.

The NRR(SF) used in Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand does not require derating as it resembles the manner in which the typical user will wear hearing protection.

==== Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) ====

Hearing protectors sold in the US are required by the EPA to have a noise reduction rating (NRR), which is an estimate of noise reduction at the ear when protectors are worn properly.

Real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT) measurements are performed multiple times with 10 to 20 subjects to determine the NRR. Using the collected data, an average group attenuation is reported along with a standard deviation for attenuation on the hearing protector package.

Due to the discrepancy between how protectors are fit in the testing laboratory and how users wear protectors in the real world, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have developed derating formulas to reduce the effective NRR.

While the NRR and the SNR (Single Number Rating) are designed to be used with C-weighted noise, which means that the lower frequencies are not de-emphasized, other ratings (NRR(SF) and NRSA) are determined for use with A-weighted noise levels, which have lower frequencies de-emphasized. NIOSH recommended and the U.S. EPA mandated that 7-dB compensation between C and A weighting be applied when the NRR is used with A-weighted noise levels.

The OSHA training manual for inspectors says the adequacy of hearing protection for use in a hazardous noise environment should be derated to account for how workers typically wear protection relative to how manufacturers test the protector&#x27;s attenuation in the laboratory. For all types of hearing protection, OSHA&#x27;s derating factor is 50%. If used with C-weighted noise, the derated NRR will become NRR/2. If used with A-weighted noise, OSHA applies the 7-dB adjustment for C-A weighting first then derates the remainder. For example, a protector with 33-dB attenuation would have this derating:

: Derated NRR = (33 – 7)/2

NIOSH has proposed a different method for derating based upon the type of protector. For earmuffs, the NRR should be derated by 25%, for slow-recovery foam earplugs the derating is 50% for all other protection, the derating is 70%. NIOSH applies the C-A spectral compensation differently than OSHA. Where OSHA subtracts the 7-dB factor first and derates the result, NIOSH derates the NRR first and then compensates for the C-A difference. For example, to find the derated NRR for an earmuff by using the NIOSH derating system, the following equation would be used:

: Derated NRR = (Original NRR x (1-.25)) – 7

Painful discomfort occurs at approximately 120 to 125 dB(A), with some references claiming 133 dB(A) for the threshold of pain. Active ear muffs are available with electronic noise cancellation that can reduce direct path ear canal noise by approximately 17–33 dB, depending on the low, medium, or high frequency at which attenuation is measured. Passive earplugs vary in their measured attenuation, ranging from 20 dB to 30 dB, depending on the fit of the earplugs, whether the employee can and knows how to insert the earplugs into the ear canal correctly, and whether they are used correctly and if low pass mechanical filters are also being used.

==== Double protection ====
The Canadian standard requires the use of two passive protective measures simultaneously at noise levels above 105 dBA. But the noise reduction does not increase very much. It is recommended to estimate the attenuation by adding 5 dB to the highest attenuation of one of the two HPDs. This recommendation does not take into account individual differences at all, and may lead to error.

Using both ear muffs (whether passive or active) and earplugs simultaneously results in maximum protection, but the efficacy of such combined protection relative to preventing permanent ear damage is inconclusive, with evidence indicating that a combined noise reduction ratio (NRR) of only 36 dB (C-weighted) is the maximum possible using ear muffs and earplugs simultaneously, equating to only a 36 - 7 = 29 dB(A) protection. Some high-end, passive, custom-molded earplugs also have a mechanical filter inserted into the center of the earmolded plug, with a small opening facing to the outside; this design permits being able to hear range commands at a gun range, for example, while still having full rating impulse noise protection.

Such custom molded earplugs with low pass filter and mechanical valve typically have a +85 dB(A) mechanical clamp, in addition to having a lowpass filter response, thereby providing typically 30-31 dB attenuation to loud impulse noises, with only a 21 dB reduction under low noise conditions across the human voice audible frequency range (300–4000 Hz) (thereby providing low attenuation between shots being fired), to permit hearing range commands. Similar functions are also available in standardized earplugs that are not custom molded.

==== Derating in several countries ====

The wide variation in recommendations may be due in part to the very large inter-individual variability in results that cannot be predicted; but can be taken into account by individual measurements.

==== Expected updates ====
In 2007, the American National Standards Institute published a new standard for noise reduction ratings for hearing protectors, ANSI S12.68-2007. Using the real ear attenuation at threshold data collected by a laboratory test prescribed in ANSI S12.6-2008, the noise reduction statistic for A-weighted noise (NRSA) is computed using a set of 100 noises listed in the standard. The noise reduction rating, rather than be computed for a single noise spectrum the NRSA incorporates variability of both subject and spectral effects. ANSI S12.68 also defines a method to estimate the performance of a protector in an atypical noise environment.

Building upon work from the U.S. Air Force and the ISO 4869-2 standard, the protector&#x27;s attenuation as a function of the difference in C and A-weighted noise level is used to predict typical performance in that noise environment. The derating may be quite severe (10 to 15 decibels) for protectors that have significant differences between low and high frequency attenuation. For &quot;flat&quot; attenuation protectors, the effect of C-A is less. This new system eliminates the need for calculators, relies on graphs and databases of empirical data, and is believed to be a more accurate system for determining NRRs.

=== Personal attenuation rating (PAR) ===

Similar to a noise reduction rating (NRR) required on hearing protection devices in the United States, a personal attenuation rating (PAR) can be obtained through a hearing protection fit-testing system. The PAR is subtracted from the measured noise exposure to estimate the total noise exposure an individual is receiving when wearing hearing protection. The PAR is regarded as more accurate than the NRR because it is calculated per individual and per hearing protection device, while NRR is a generalized estimate of potential sound reduction based on the protection provided to a small population of people.

In order to achieve significant attenuation, fit-testing and extensive personalized (one-on-one) training was found to be essential, whereas simple instructions did not lead to significant attenuation ove giving no instructions at all.

==Health risks==

Earplugs are generally safe, but some precautions may be needed against a number of possible health risks, with additional ones appearing with long-term use:

*Pushing in earplugs into the external ear canal may cause the air pressure to rise in it, in effect pushing against the eardrum and causing pain. This may be caused by pressure on the ear while lying down on the side, and is also the case when completely expanded foam earplugs are pushed further into the ear. To bypass the latter risk, such earplugs are instead removed, compressed and inserted to the desired depth. Vice versa, when pulled out, the resultant negative pressure pulls the eardrum. Therefore, some earplugs are better carefully screwed or jiggled out rather than yanked out. Yawning does not help to equalize this air pressure difference, since it equalizes the pressures between the middle ear and the environment, while this overpressure rather is located in the outer ear, between the eardrum and the earplug.
*If pushed too far into the ear canal, they may push earwax and debris into the canal and possibly against the ear drum. As a precaution, earplugs should not be pushed further into the ear canal than they may be grabbed and rotated. Earwax impacted by earplugs can be removed by irrigation or other remedies, as described here.
*There is a possibility of allergic reactions, but this is likely rare, as earplugs generally are made of immunologically inert materials.

===Long-term use===
Custom shaped plugs are recommended for long-term use, since they are more comfortable and gentle to the skin and will not go too far into the ear canal.

Nevertheless, prolonged or frequently repeated use of earplugs has the following health risks, in addition to the short-term health risks:

*They may cause earwax to build up and plug the outer ear, since it blocks the normal flow of earwax outwards. This can result in tinnitus, hearing loss, discharge, pain or infection. Excess earwax should be carefully removed from the ear, and earplugs should be cleaned regularly with water and mild soap. However, foam type earplugs are usually designed to be disposable, and will expand and lose their memory property upon drying after washing with water and soap. From then on, they will expand very quickly after being compressed, making proper insertion into the ear canal quite problematic. They also lose a large proportion of sound attenuating capability after such washing and drying.
*They may cause irritation of the temporomandibular joint, which is located very close to the ear canal, causing pain. Individually fitted non-elastic earplugs may be less likely to cause this irritation compared with foam ones that expand inside the ear canal.
*Earplugs are also a possible cause of ear inflammation (otitis externa), although the short-term use of earplugs when swimming and shampooing hair may actually help prevent it. Still, many pathogenic bacteria grow well on warm, moist, foam-type plugs (polyvinylchloride (PVC) or polyurethane). However, there need also be a loss of integrity of the skin for infection to occur. Hard and poorly fitting earplugs can scratch the skin of the ear canal and set off an episode. When earplugs are used during an acute episode, disposable plugs are recommended, or used plugs must be cleaned and dried properly to avoid contaminating the healing ear canal with infected discharge.

<text>Thomas Beccon or Becon (c. 1511–1567) was an English cleric and Protestant reformer from Norfolk.

==Life==
Beccon was born c.1511 in Norfolk, England. He entered the University of Cambridge in March 1526-27, probably St John&#x27;s College. He studied under Hugh Latimer and was ordained in 1533. In 1532 he was admitted a member of the community of the College of St. John the Evangelist, Rushworth - now Rushford.

He was arrested for Protestant preaching and was forced to recant around 1540. He then began to write under the pen name of Theodore Basille. When Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, Beccon was made chaplain to the Lord Protector. He was also presented by the Worshipful Company of Grocers to the living of St Stephen&#x27;s, Walbrook in the City of London. Thomas Cranmer made him one of the Six Preachers of Canterbury, and a chaplain in Cranmer&#x27;s own household. He contributed to Cranmer&#x27;s Homilies.

When Mary I of England came to the throne in 1553, as a married priest, Beccon was divested of his ecclesiastical positions. In August that year he was designated a seditious preacher and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was released in March the following year and fled the country. He went to Strasbourg and then to Frankfurt, and he taught at Marburg University around 1556–1559. When Elizabeth came to power, he returned to England and was made a canon of the Canterbury Cathedral in 1559. In 1560 he was successfully nominated to Christ Church Newgate and in 1563 to St Dionis Backchurch, both in the City of London.

==Works==

Beccon&#x27;s writings were initially Lutheran. They became increasingly harsh and Zwinglian with time. In 1559 he wrote &quot;The Displaying of the Popish Mass.&quot;

The following text is taken from an article by Alexander Balloch Grosart in the DNB (1885-1900), now in the public domain:

==Family==
He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Godfrey of Winchester. They had three children that survived past infancy. Theodore, his eldest surviving son became a physician in Canterbury. Basil Becon followed his father into the Church and held several livings in Kent. His daughter Rachel married William Beswicke of Horsmanden who served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1616.

<text>The Hsinchu Science Park (HSP; ) is an industrial park complex that originated as one campus straddled Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Chunan and Tongluo, later expanded to cover six campuses across Taiwan. It was established by the government of Taiwan on 15 December 1980. While the whole complex and the first campus share the same name, the name &quot;Hsinchu Science Park&quot; usually refers to the campus rather than the whole complex.

==History==
The idea of the establishment of the Hsinchu Science Park was first proposed by Shu Shien-Siu, the former President of National Tsing Hua University and Minister of Science and Technology. After Shu became the Minister of Science and Technology in 1973, he traveled to the United States, Europe, and Japan to learn and study their conditions of the development of science and technology. In 1976, Shu came up with the idea of building a science and technology park like that of Silicon Valley. President Chiang Ching-kuo proposed to build the park in Longtan District because of the potential future benefits that could be drawn from National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology and the military. However, Shu argued that the technology and science park should not be close to the military as the primary goal of the founding of the park is to expand the size of private economy and creative vitality of Taiwan. Shu&#x27;s idea was to build the park in Hsinchu next to the National Tsing Hua University and the (then) National Chiao Tung University like the Silicon Valley, which is adjacent to Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. Shu&#x27;s idea was ultimately approved by Chiang and the park was built and opened in 1980 in Hsinchu.

After the original idea of the establishment of the science park and the location of the park were settled, Chiang Ching-kuo assigned the task of constructing the Hsinchu Science Park.
Irving Tze Ho () (1921–2003) was tasked to set up the park in 1979 and serve as its first director.
Li Kwoh-ting, former Finance Minister of the Republic of China, was among those who significantly contributed to the founding of the park, as ordered by Chiang. Inspired by Silicon Valley, Li consulted Frederick Terman on how Taiwan could follow its example. From there, Li convinced talents who had gone abroad to build companies in this new Silicon Valley in Taiwan. Among those who returned is Morris Chang, who later led the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and founded TSMC. Li also introduced the concept of venture capital to the country to attract funds to finance high-tech startups in Taiwan.

=== Timeline ===
* : Taiwanese Industrial Technology Research Institute () established the first 4-inch wafer demonstration factory in Taiwan.
* : Construction began on the &quot;Science and Industrial Park&quot; () situated at eastern suburbs of Hsinchu city, and the park would focus on electronics contract manufacturing.
* : The construction of &quot;Science and Industrial Park&quot; has completed, alongside the creation of the administration ministry &quot;Science Park Bureau, National Science Council&quot;.
* : The first specialized wastewater treatment plant was activated by the park to address pollution from manufacturing.
* : Construction began on the &quot;Longtan Science and Industrial Park&quot; in Longtan Township, Taoyuan County.
* : The government reviewed the options and agreed on the expansion of the industrial parks, which would locate in Zhunan Township and Tongluo Township in Miaoli County, adjacent to the south of Hsinchu County. Later the two locations became their respective science parks.
* : Construction began on the Zhunan Science Park.
* : The government agreed on the establishment of &quot;Biomedical Science Park&quot;, which was officially established almost two years later, on .
* : The &quot;Longtan Science and Industrial Park&quot; was officially incorporated into the &quot;Science and Industrial Park&quot;.
* : The government approved on the establishment of &quot;Yilan Science and Industrial Park&quot;.
* : Construction began on the &quot;Tongluo Science and Industrial Park&quot;.
* : The &quot;Science and Industrial Park&quot; was renamed to &quot;Hsinchu Science and Industrial Park&quot;.
* : The &quot;industrial&quot; in the name was dropped. The park complex was further renamed to &quot;Hsinchu Science Park&quot;.

==Overview==
The park houses more than 500 high-tech companies, mainly involved in the semiconductor, computer, telecommunication, and optoelectronics industries, have been established in the park since the end of December 2003. Its 400 technology companies accounted for 10% of Taiwan&#x27;s gross domestic product in 2007. It is home to the world&#x27;s top two semiconductor foundries, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), both of which were established at the nearby Industrial Technology Research Institute. Taiwan is the only country that possesses a professional division-of-labor system in the semiconductor industry and also has the highest density of 12-inch wafer-producing fabs, most of which are based in the park.
Next door to the science park are two of Taiwan&#x27;s science and engineering powerhouses, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and National Tsing Hua University, and the National Space Organization, the Taiwanese space agency, are located in the park.

There were local residents&#x27; protests against water and air pollution. The Park&#x27;s industrial wastewater treatment plant began to operate in 1986 and effectively treats wastewater for maximum safety while Taiwan&#x27;s National Environmental Protection Department monitors the air quality in the park and surrounding areas to maintain clean air quality.

==Locations==
Currently, the Hsinchu Science Park complex covers six campuses, with a total development area of 1,471 hectares: 
* Hsinchu Science Park in East District, Hsinchu City and Baoshan, Hsinchu County
* Zhunan Science Park in Zhunan, Miaoli County

<doc id="945779" wikidata="Q748939" url="?curid=945779" title="Little corella">
<text>The little corella (Cacatua sanguinea), also known as the short-billed corella, bare-eyed cockatoo, blood-stained cockatoo, and little cockatoo is a white cockatoo native to Australia and southern New Guinea. It was known as &quot;Birdirra&quot; among the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara. They would keep them as pets, or traditionally cook and eat them. The downy feathers are used in traditional ceremonies and dances where they adorn head and armbands.

==Taxonomy==

The first recorded description of the species was by English ornithologist John Gould in 1843. There are four subspecies as follows:
* &quot;C. s. sanguinea&quot;
* &quot;C. s. normantoni&quot;
* &quot;C. s. transfreta&quot;
* &quot;C. s. gymnopis&quot;
* &quot;C. s. westralensis&quot; (Mathews 1917)

==Description==

The little corella is a small white cockatoo growing to in length and weighs , with a mean weight of . It is similar in appearance to both the long-billed corella and the western corella, but the little corella is smaller, and unlike either of those species, it has upper and lower mandibles of similar length. It is easily distinguished from the long-billed corella by the lack of an orange throat bar. &quot;C. s. normantoni&quot; and &quot;C. s. transfreta&quot; are a little smaller than the nominate form. &quot;C. s. normantoni&quot; is lightly brownish on the underside of flight and tail feathers. &quot;C. s. gymnopis&quot; has darker blue eye-rings, more strongly marked pink lores and a yellow wash to the lower-ear coverts. Females are slightly smaller than males in weight, wing length, culmen size, tarsus length, tail length and eye ring diameter.

==Distribution and habitat==
The nominate form, &quot;C. s. sanguinea&quot; is found in Northern Australia. &quot;C. s. normantoni&quot; is found on the Western Cape York Peninsula. &quot;C. s. transfreta&quot; is found in New Guinea. &quot;C. s. gymnopis&quot; is found in Central, Eastern, and South-eastern Australia. Habitat ranges from the arid deserts of central Australia to the eastern coastal plains, but they are not found in thick forests. Little corellas can also be found in urban areas, including Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane, where they feed on lawns and playing fields. They are numerous in farmlands throughout New South Wales and Queensland, and have become so common in some areas that they are considered to be crop pests, and can be destructive to the trees in which they perch, by chewing the bark off smaller twigs.

==Behaviour==
Little corellas congregate in flocks of up to several thousand, which often include other birds such as galahs, sulphur-crested cockatoos and red-tailed black cockatoos. They generally roost in trees overnight, and fly off to feed in the early morning before returning in the late evening. Flocks will often fly many kilometres between their feeding and roosting areas, and in desert areas must also fly to watering holes twice a day, while corellas which live in coastal areas do not have to fly long distances to find water.

===Call===
The call consists of high pitched notes and screeches somewhat similar to the sulfur-crested cockatoo. Large flocks will call simultaneously and can create a deafening screeching sound audible from several kilometers away.

===Breeding===

Breeding occurs from May to October, and usually takes place earlier in the north of its range. The nest is usually in a tree hollow, cliff cavity or termite mound.

===Feeding===
Little corellas usually feed on the ground, however occasionally feed in trees and shrubs. They eat a variety of both wild and cultivated seeds and regularly feed on lawn grasses in urban areas. They frequently feed on cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and can become a considerable agricultural pest in some areas.

===Playing===
When little corellas play, they become very noisy. They have conversations with each other, fly around and also show off. Little corellas show off by hanging themselves upside-down with their feet, beaks or both.

==Relationship to humans==
In the state of South Australia, little corellas are considered &quot;unprotected native fauna&quot; and may be shot (without a permit), trapped or gassed (with a permit) by landowners. Permits are also available to take a limited number of little corellas from the wild each year for avicultural purposes.

==Threats==
In July 2019, in a scene that was said to resemble a &quot;horror movie&quot;, about 60 corellas in Adelaide, South Australia, died in a suspected case of poisoning, after &quot;falling from the sky&quot;, bleeding from their mouths, and wailing. At least 57 of the birds were long-billed corellas, with a few of them being were short-billed corellas. It was hoped that whoever poisoned them would get traced after doing a report on toxicology, which could nevertheless take several weeks to complete, because in Australia, people were required to register if they purchase poisons, according to Sarah King, founder of Casper&#x27;s Bird Rescue, who witnessed the deaths, and also said that the type of poison was a slow one that takes several weeks to work. Additionally, the local Alexandrina council had beforehand called for short-billed corellas to be culled for damaging crops and chewing on streetlights, damaging built infrastructure such as buildings and sporting equipment, and displacing other native species of birds and bees, possums, and other organisms.

<doc id="945780" wikidata="Q4883578" url="?curid=945780" title="Bellcrank">
<text>A bellcrank is a type of crank that changes motion through an angle. The angle can range from 0 to 360 degrees, but 90-degree and 180-degree bellcranks are most common.

The name comes from its first use, changing the vertical pull on a rope to a horizontal pull on the striker of a bell to sound it.

==Design==
A typical 90-degree bellcrank consists of an L-shaped crank pivoted where the two arms of the L meet. Moving rods or cables are attached to the outer ends of the L. When one is pulled, the L rotates around the pivot point, pulling on the other rod.

A typical 180-degree bellcrank consists of a straight bar that pivots at or near its center. When one rod is pulled or pushed, the bar rotates around the pivot point, pulling or pushing on the other rod.

Changing the length of the bellcrank&#x27;s arms changes the mechanical advantage of the system. Many applications do not change the direction of motion but instead amplify a force &quot;in line&quot;, which a bellcrank can do in a limited space. There is a tradeoff between range of motion, linearity of motion, and size. The greater the angle traversed by the crank, the more the motion ratio changes, and the more non-linear the motion becomes.

==Applications==
===Aircraft===
Bellcranks are often used in aircraft flight control systems to connect the pilot&#x27;s controls to the control surfaces. For example, on light aircraft, the rudder often has a bellcrank (also called a control horn) whose pivot point is the rudder hinge. A cable connects one of the pilot&#x27;s rudder pedal to one side of the bellcrank. When the pilot pushes the rudder pedal, the cable pulls the bellcrank, causing the rudder to rotate. The opposite rudder pedal is connected to the other end of the bellcrank to rotate the rudder in the opposite direction.

=== Architectural ===
Bellcrank mechanisms were installed at the top of entryway stairs in multi-unit Victorian and Edwardian homes ( to 1930), particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, to allow residents to open and close the doors remotely so they would not need to walk down the stairs to welcome guests.
=== Automotive ===
Bellcranks are also seen in automotive applications, such as in the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the carburetor or connecting the brake pedal to the master cylinder.

In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in pullrod and pushrod suspensions in cars or in the Christie suspension in tanks. More vertical suspension designs such as MacPherson struts may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel into horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.

=== Bicycles ===
Bellcranks are used in some internally geared hub assemblies to select gears. The motion from a Bowden cable is translated by a bellcrank to a push rod, which selects which portion of the epicyclic gears are driven by the bicycle&#x27;s rear sprocket.

<text>In the United Kingdom, the privileged presses are Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press. They are called this because, under letters patent issued by the Crown defining their charters, only they have the right to print and publish the Book of Common Prayer and the Authorised Version of the Bible in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Cambridge University Press charter from 1534 gives it the right to print &quot;all manner of books&quot;, and Oxford University Press received a similar right when it was chartered in 1636. In addition both presses, by virtue of a separate set of letters patent, hold the explicit right to print the Authorised Version.

<text>There are 22 district football associations in Portugal. These organizations are the governing bodies (alongside the Portuguese Football Federation) of football in each Portuguese district.

==Overview==

Until the reform of Portuguese football in 1948, all clubs in a given district had to participate in the district championship, even those in Primeira Liga and Segunda Divisão; after 1948, a Terceira Divisão was established for transition between the district championship and national leagues and the top level clubs no longer had to play in their district championship (the arrangement did not include clubs from the Azores and Madeira, which did not reach the top division until the 1970s).

With the reform of Portuguese Football League system in 2013, the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores became the Portuguese third-level football league, making the principal district championship the fourth-level leagues.

While the three districts in which the Azores were divided pre-autonomy were abolished, the district football associations haven&#x27;t merged, and still exist as separate entities. Nevertheless, beginning in 2013, their clubs compete in a unified Azores league before joining the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores.

==List of district associations==
The 22 DFAs are:

# &quot;Associação de Futebol do Algarve&quot; (for the district of Faro)
# &quot;Associação de Futebol de Angra do Heroísmo&quot; (former Azorean district of Angra do Heroísmo)
# &quot;Associação de Futebol de Aveiro&quot; (district of Aveiro)
# &quot;Associação de Futebol de Beja&quot; (district of Beja)

<text>A myxoma (New Latin from Greek &#x27;mucus&#x27;) is a myxoid tumor of primitive connective tissue. It is most commonly found in the heart (and is the most common primary tumor of the heart in adults) but can also occur in other locations.

==Types==
Table below:

1.SMA, smooth muscle actin. 2.MSA, muscle-specific actin. 3.EMA, epithelial membrane antigen.

== Symptoms and signs==
Symptoms associated with cardiac myxomas are typically due to the effect of the mass of the tumor obstructing the normal flow of blood within the chambers of the heart. Because pedunculated myxomas are somewhat mobile, symptoms may only occur when the patient is in a particular position.

Some symptoms of myxoma may be associated with the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) by the myxoma. High levels of IL-6 may be associated with a higher risk of embolism of the myxoma.

Symptoms of a cardiac myxoma include:
* Dyspnea on exertion
* Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
* Fever
* Weight loss (see cachexia)
* Lightheadedness or syncope (Loss of consciousness)
* Hemoptysis
* Sudden death
* Tachycardia or milder heartrate, i.e. 75–100 cycl/min

== Location ==
=== Ocular myxoma ===
Myxoma is a rare, benign stromal tumor of mesenchymal origin often confused with other conjunctival stromal tumors. Conjunctival myxomas are thought to originate in Tenon&#x27;s capsule and can masquerade as conjunctival lymphoma, lymphangioma, ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN), or amelanotic melanoma.
* Atrial myxoma
* Cutaneous myxoma
* Odontogenic myxoma
=== Atrial myxoma ===
Myxomas are usually located in either the left or right atrium of the heart; about 86 percent occur in the left atrium.

Myxomas are typically pedunculated, with a stalk that is attached to the interatrial septum. The most common location for attachment of the stalk is the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum.

An atrial myxoma may create an extra heart sound, audible to auscultation just after S2. It is most seen on echocardiography, as a pedunculated mass that is heterogeneous in appearance. A left atrial myxoma will cause an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

The differential diagnosis include other cardiac tumors such as lipomas and rhabdomyomas (and rarely teratomas). These other tumors of the heart are typically not pedunculated, however, and are more likely to infiltrate the muscle of the heart. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help non-invasively diagnose cardiac tumors. However, diagnosis usually requires examination of a tissue sample by a pathologist.
== Treatment ==
Myxomas are usually removed surgically. The surgeon removes the myxoma, along with at least 5 surrounding millimeters of atrial septum. The septum is then repaired, using material from the pericardium.

== Epidemiology ==
Cardiac myxomas predominantly appear in females in their 30s to 40s. Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor affecting adults, accounting for one quarter to half of primary cardiac tumors seen in clinical practice.
