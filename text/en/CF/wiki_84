<text>In abstract algebra, a valuation ring is an integral domain &quot;D&quot; such that for every non-zero element &quot;x&quot; of its field of fractions &quot;F&quot;, at least one of &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot;−1 belongs to &quot;D&quot;.

Given a field &quot;F&quot;, if &quot;D&quot; is a subring of &quot;F&quot; such that either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot;−1 belongs to
&quot;D&quot; for every nonzero &quot;x&quot; in &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;D&quot; is said to be a valuation ring for the field &quot;F&quot; or a place of &quot;F&quot;. Since &quot;F&quot; in this case is indeed the field of fractions of &quot;D&quot;, a valuation ring for a field is a valuation ring. Another way to characterize the valuation rings of a field &quot;F&quot; is that valuation rings &quot;D&quot; of &quot;F&quot; have &quot;F&quot; as their field of fractions, and their ideals are totally ordered by inclusion; or equivalently their principal ideals are totally ordered by inclusion. In particular, every valuation ring is a local ring.

The valuation rings of a field are the maximal elements of the set of the local subrings in the field partially ordered by dominance or refinement, where
:formula_1 dominates formula_2 if formula_3 and formula_4.

Every local ring in a field &quot;K&quot; is dominated by some valuation ring of &quot;K&quot;.

An integral domain whose localization at any prime ideal is a valuation ring is called a Prüfer domain.

== Definitions ==
There are several equivalent definitions of valuation ring (see below for the characterization in terms of dominance). For an integral domain &quot;D&quot; and its field of fractions &quot;K&quot;, the following are equivalent:
# For every non-zero &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot;, at least one of &quot;x&quot; or &quot;x&quot;−1 is in &quot;D&quot;.
# The ideals of &quot;D&quot; are totally ordered by inclusion.
# The principal ideals of &quot;D&quot; are totally ordered by inclusion (i.e. the elements in &quot;D&quot; are, up to units, totally ordered by divisibility.)
# There is a totally ordered abelian group Γ (called the value group) and a valuation ν: &quot;K&quot; → Γ ∪ {∞} with &quot;D&quot; = { &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; | ν(&quot;x&quot;) ≥ 0 }.

The equivalence of the first three definitions follows easily. A theorem of states that any ring satisfying the first three conditions satisfies the fourth: take Γ to be the quotient &quot;K&quot;×/&quot;D&quot;× of the unit group of &quot;K&quot; by the unit group of &quot;D&quot;, and take ν to be the natural projection. We can turn Γ into a totally ordered group by declaring the residue classes of elements of &quot;D&quot; as &quot;positive&quot;.

Even further, given any totally ordered abelian group Γ, there is a valuation ring &quot;D&quot; with value group Γ (see Hahn series).

From the fact that the ideals of a valuation ring are totally ordered, one can conclude that a valuation ring is a local domain, and that every finitely generated ideal of a valuation ring is principal (i.e., a valuation ring is a Bézout domain). In fact, it is a theorem of Krull that an integral domain is a valuation ring if and only if it is a local Bézout domain. It also follows from this that a valuation ring is Noetherian if and only if it is a principal ideal domain. In this case, it is either a field or it has exactly one non-zero prime ideal; in the latter case it is called a discrete valuation ring. (By convention, a field is not a discrete valuation ring.)

A value group is called &quot;discrete&quot; if it is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers, and a valuation ring has a discrete valuation group if and only if it is a discrete valuation ring.

Very rarely, &quot;valuation ring&quot; may refer to a ring that satisfies the second or third condition but is not necessarily a domain. A more common term for this type of ring is &quot;uniserial ring&quot;.

== Examples ==
* Any field formula_5 is a valuation ring. For example, the field of rational functions formula_6 on an algebraic variety formula_7.
* A simple non-example is the integral domain formula_8 since the inverse of a generic formula_9 is formula_10.
* The field of power series:
::formula_11
:has the valuation formula_12. The subring formula_13 is a valuation ring as well.

* formula_14 the localization of the integers formula_15 at the prime ideal (&quot;p&quot;), consisting of ratios where the numerator is any integer and the denominator is not divisible by &quot;p&quot;. The field of fractions is the field of rational numbers formula_16
* The ring of meromorphic functions on the entire complex plane which have a Maclaurin series (Taylor series expansion at zero) is a valuation ring. The field of fractions are the functions meromorphic on the whole plane. If &quot;f&quot; does not have a Maclaurin series then 1/&quot;f&quot; does.
* Any ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers formula_17 for a given prime &quot;p&quot; is a local ring, with field of fractions the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers formula_18. The integral closure formula_19 of the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers is also a local ring, with field of fractions formula_20 (the algebraic closure of the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers). Both formula_17 and formula_19 are valuation rings.
* Let k be an ordered field. An element of k is called finite if it lies between two integers &quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;m&quot;; otherwise it is called infinite. The set &quot;D&quot; of finite elements of k is a valuation ring. The set of elements &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;D&quot; and &quot;x&quot;−1 ∉ &quot;D&quot; is the set of infinitesimal elements; and an element &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ∉ &quot;D&quot; and &quot;x&quot;−1 ∈ &quot;D&quot; is called infinite.
* The ring F of finite elements of a hyperreal field *R (an ordered field containing the real numbers) is a valuation ring of *R. F consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, which is equivalent to saying a hyperreal number &quot;x&quot; such that −&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; for some standard integer &quot;n&quot;. The residue field, finite hyperreal numbers modulo the ideal of infinitesimal hyperreal numbers, is isomorphic to the real numbers.
* A common geometric example comes from algebraic plane curves. Consider the polynomial ring formula_23 and an irreducible polynomial formula_24 in that ring. Then the ring formula_25 is the ring of polynomial functions on the curve formula_26. Choose a point formula_27 such that formula_28 and it is a regular point on the curve; i.e., the local ring &quot;R&quot; at the point is a regular local ring of Krull dimension one or a discrete valuation ring.
* For example, consider the inclusion formula_29. These are all subrings in the field of bounded-below power series formula_30.

== Dominance and integral closure ==
The units, or invertible elements, of a valuation ring are the elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;D&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; −1 is also a member of &quot;D&quot;. The other elements of &quot;D&quot; – called nonunits – do not have an inverse in &quot;D&quot;, and they form an ideal &quot;M&quot;. This ideal is maximal among the (totally ordered) ideals of D. Since &quot;M&quot; is a maximal ideal, the quotient ring &quot;D&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a field, called the residue field of &quot;D&quot;.

In general, we say a local ring formula_31 dominates a local ring formula_32 if formula_33 and formula_34; in other words, the inclusion formula_35 is a local ring homomorphism. Every local ring formula_36 in a field &quot;K&quot; is dominated by some valuation ring of &quot;K&quot;. Indeed, the set consisting of all subrings &quot;R&quot; of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;A&quot; and formula_37 is nonempty and is inductive; thus, has a maximal element formula_38 by Zorn&#x27;s lemma. We claim &quot;R&quot; is a valuation ring. &quot;R&quot; is a local ring with maximal ideal containing formula_39 by maximality. Again by maximality it is also integrally closed. Now, if formula_40, then, by maximality, formula_41 and thus we can write:
:formula_42.

Since formula_43 is a unit element, this implies that formula_44 is integral over &quot;R&quot;; thus is in &quot;R&quot;. This proves &quot;R&quot; is a valuation ring. (&quot;R&quot; dominates &quot;A&quot; since its maximal ideal contains formula_45 by construction.)

A local ring &quot;R&quot; in a field &quot;K&quot; is a valuation ring if and only if it is a maximal element of the set of all local rings contained in &quot;K&quot; partially ordered by dominance. This easily follows from the above.

Let &quot;A&quot; be a subring of a field &quot;K&quot; and formula_46 a ring homomorphism into an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;. Then &quot;f&quot; extends to a ring homomorphism formula_47, &quot;D&quot; some valuation ring of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;A&quot;. (Proof: Let formula_48 be a maximal extension, which clearly exists by Zorn&#x27;s lemma. By maximality, &quot;R&quot; is a local ring with maximal ideal containing the kernel of &quot;f&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; is a local ring dominating &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is algebraic over &quot;R&quot;; if not, formula_49 contains a polynomial ring formula_50 to which &quot;g&quot; extends, a contradiction to maximality. It follows formula_51 is an algebraic field extension of formula_52. Thus, formula_53 extends &quot;g&quot;; hence, &quot;S&quot; = &quot;R&quot;.)

If a subring &quot;R&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; contains a valuation ring &quot;D&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, then, by checking Definition 1, &quot;R&quot; is also a valuation ring of &quot;K&quot;. In particular, &quot;R&quot; is local and its maximal ideal contracts to some prime ideal of &quot;D&quot;, say, formula_45. Then formula_55 since formula_38 dominates formula_57, which is a valuation ring since the ideals are totally ordered. This observation is subsumed to the following: there is a bijective correspondence formula_58 the set of all subrings of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;D&quot;. In particular, &quot;D&quot; is integrally closed, and the Krull dimension of &quot;D&quot; is the number of proper subrings of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;D&quot;.

In fact, the integral closure of an integral domain &quot;A&quot; in the field of fractions &quot;K&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is the intersection of all valuation rings of &quot;K&quot; containing &quot;A&quot;. Indeed, the integral closure is contained in the intersection since the valuation rings are integrally closed. Conversely, let &quot;x&quot; be in &quot;K&quot; but not integral over &quot;A&quot;. Since the ideal formula_59 is not formula_60, it is contained in a maximal ideal formula_45. Then there is a valuation ring &quot;R&quot; that dominates the localization of formula_60 at formula_45. Since formula_64, formula_40.

The dominance is used in algebraic geometry. Let &quot;X&quot; be an algebraic variety over a field &quot;k&quot;. Then we say a valuation ring &quot;R&quot; in formula_66 has &quot;center &quot;x&quot; on &quot;X&quot;&quot; if formula_38 dominates the local ring formula_68 of the structure sheaf at &quot;x&quot;.

== Ideals in valuation rings ==
We may describe the ideals in the valuation ring by means of its value group.

Let Γ be a totally ordered abelian group. A subset Δ of Γ is called a &quot;segment&quot; if it is nonempty and, for any α in Δ, any element between −α and α is also in Δ (end points included). A subgroup of Γ is called an &quot;isolated subgroup&quot; if it is a segment and is a proper subgroup.

Let &quot;D&quot; be a valuation ring with valuation &quot;v&quot; and value group Γ. For any subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;D&quot;, we let formula_69 be the complement of the union of formula_70 and formula_71 in formula_72. If &quot;I&quot; is a proper ideal, then formula_73 is a segment of formula_72. In fact, the mapping formula_75 defines an inclusion-reversing bijection between the set of proper ideals of &quot;D&quot; and the set of segments of formula_72. Under this correspondence, the nonzero prime ideals of &quot;D&quot; correspond bijectively to the isolated subgroups of Γ.

Example: The ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers formula_17 is a valuation ring with value group formula_15. The zero subgroup of formula_15 corresponds to the unique maximal ideal formula_80 and the whole group to the zero ideal. The maximal ideal is the only isolated subgroup of formula_15.

The set of isolated subgroups is totally ordered by inclusion. The height or rank &quot;r&quot;(Γ) of Γ is defined to be the cardinality of the set of isolated subgroups of Γ. Since the nonzero prime ideals are totally ordered and they correspond to isolated subgroups of Γ, the height of Γ is equal to the Krull dimension of the valuation ring &quot;D&quot; associated with Γ.

The most important special case is height one, which is equivalent to Γ being a subgroup of the real numbers formula_82 under addition (or equivalently, of the positive real numbers formula_83 under multiplication.) A valuation ring with a valuation of height one has a corresponding absolute value defining an ultrametric place. A special case of this are the discrete valuation rings mentioned earlier.

The rational rank &quot;rr&quot;(Γ) is defined as the rank of the value group as an abelian group,
:formula_84

==Places==
=== General definition ===
A &quot;place&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; is a ring homomorphism &quot;p&quot; from a valuation ring &quot;D&quot; of &quot;K&quot; to some field such that, for any formula_85, formula_86. The image of a place is a field called the residue field of &quot;p&quot;. For example, the canonical map formula_87 is a place.

==== Example ====
Let &quot;A&quot; be a Dedekind domain and formula_45 a prime ideal. Then the canonical map formula_89 is a place.

=== Specialization of places ===
We say a place &quot;p&quot; &quot;specializes to&quot; a place &#x27;, denoted by formula_90, if the valuation ring of &quot;p&quot; contains the valuation ring of &quot;p″&quot;. In algebraic geometry, we say a prime ideal formula_45 specializes to formula_92 if formula_93. The two notions coincide: formula_90 if and only if a prime ideal corresponding to &quot;p&quot; specializes to a prime ideal corresponding to &#x27; in some valuation ring (recall that if formula_95 are valuation rings of the same field, then &quot;D&quot; corresponds to a prime ideal of formula_96.)

==== Example ====
For example, in the function field formula_6 of some algebraic variety formula_7 every prime ideal formula_99 contained in a maximal ideal formula_100 gives a specialization formula_101.

==== Remarks ====
It can be shown: if formula_90, then formula_103 for some place &quot;q&quot; of the residue field formula_104 of &quot;p&quot;. (Observe formula_105 is a valuation ring of formula_104 and let &quot;q&quot; be the corresponding place; the rest is mechanical.) If &quot;D&quot; is a valuation ring of &quot;p&quot;, then its Krull dimension is the cardinarity of the specializations other than &quot;p&quot; to &quot;p&quot;. Thus, for any place &quot;p&quot; with valuation ring &quot;D&quot; of a field &quot;K&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, we have:

:formula_107.

If &quot;p&quot; is a place and &quot;A&quot; is a subring of the valuation ring of &quot;p&quot;, then formula_108 is called the &quot;center&quot; of &quot;p&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.

=== Places at infinity ===
For the function field on an affine variety formula_7 there are valuations which are not associated to any of the primes of formula_7. These valuations are called the places at infinity. For example, the affine line formula_111 has function field formula_112. The place associated to the localization of
:formula_113
at the maximal ideal
:formula_114
is a place at infinity.

<text>The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) was a NASA satellite instrument, specifically a spectrometer, for measuring the ozone layer. Of the five TOMS instruments which were built, four entered successful orbit. The satellites carrying TOMS instruments were:

* Nimbus 7; launched October 24, 1978. Operated until 1 August 1994. Carried TOMS instrument number 1.
* Meteor-3-5; launched 15 August 1991. Operated until December 1994. Was the first and last Soviet satellite to carry a USA made instrument. Carried TOMS instrument number 2.
* ADEOS I; launched 17 August 1996. Operated until 30 June 1997. Mission was cut short by a spacecraft failure.
* TOMS-Earth Probe; launched on July 2, 1996. Operated until 2 December 2006. Carried TOMS instrument number 3.
* QuikTOMS; launched 21 September 2001. Suffered launch failure and did not enter orbit.

Nimbus 7 and Meteor-3-5 provided global measurements of total column ozone on a daily basis and together provided a complete data set of daily ozone from November 1978 to December 1994. After an eighteen-month period when the program had no on-orbit capability, TOMS-Earth Probe launched on 2 July 1996, followed by . ADEOS I was launched on August 17, 1996, and the TOMS-instrument onboard provided data until the satellite which housed it lost power on June 30, 1997.

TOMS-Earth Probe (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer - Earth Probe, TOMS-EP, originally just TOMS, COSPAR 1996-037A) was launched on July 2, 1996, from Vandenberg AFB by a Pegasus XL rocket. The satellite project was originally known as TOMS, back in 1989 when it was selected as a SMEX mission in the Explorer program. However, it found no funding as an Explorer mission and transferred to NASA&#x27;s Earth Probe program, getting funding and becoming TOMS-EP. The small, 295 kg satellite was built for NASA by TRW; the single instrument was the TOMS 3 spectrometer. The satellite had a two-year planned life. TOMS-EP suffered a two-year delay to its launch due to launch failures of the first two Pegasus XL rockets. The launch delays led to alternations in the mission; the satellite was placed in a lower than originally planned orbit to achieve higher resolution and to enable more thorough study of UV-absorbing aerosols in the troposphere. The lower orbit was meant to complement measurements from ADEOS I enabling TOMS-EP to provide supplemental measurements. After ADEOS I failed in orbit, TOMS-EP was boosted to a higher orbit to replace ADEOS I. The transmitter for TOMS-Earth Probe failed on December 2, 2006.

The only total failure in the series was QuikTOMS, which was launched on September 21, 2001, on a Taurus rocket from Vandenberg AFB, but did not achieve orbit.

Since January 1, 2006, data from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has replaced data from TOMS-Earth Probe. The Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite on Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 have further continued the data record.

<text>A Time to Love is the twenty-third studio album by Stevie Wonder, his first since &quot;Conversation Peace&quot; in 1995. Originally to have been completed in 2004, it was finally released to stores on October 18, 2005, following an exclusive digital release on Apple&#x27;s iTunes Music Store on September 27.

The first single, issued in April 2005, was &quot;So What the Fuss&quot;, which featured Prince on guitar and En Vogue on backing vocals. Follow-up singles included &quot;Positivity&quot; with his daughter Aisha Morris, &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart&quot; and &quot;Shelter in the Rain&quot;.

The song &quot;Shelter in the Rain&quot; was in tribute to his first wife, the singer Syreeta Wright, who died of cancer the year before the album was released. Wonder was quoted as saying he would have had Wright singing lead on it had she lived.

It is also Wonder&#x27;s latest studio album to date, as of 2025 though multiple followups have long been promised.

==Reception==
The album was received with generally positive reviews, despite its having been delayed several times during the year of its release. In 2005, Wonder won the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance in the Grammy Awards for &quot;From the Bottom of My Heart&quot;, his fourth win in this category.

<doc id="966870" wikidata="Q215997" url="?curid=966870" title="Baird's tapir">
<text>The Baird&#x27;s tapir (Tapirus bairdii), also known as the Central American tapir, is a species of tapir native to Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. It is the largest of the three species of tapir native to the Americas, as well as the largest native land mammal in both Central and South America.

==Names==
The Baird&#x27;s tapir is named after the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird, who traveled to Mexico in 1843 and observed the animals. However, the species was first documented by another American naturalist, W. T. White.

Like the other American tapirs (the mountain tapir and the South American tapir), the Baird&#x27;s tapir is commonly called &quot;danta&quot; by people in all areas. In the regions around Oaxaca and Veracruz, it is referred to as the . Panamanians, and Colombians call it , and in Belize, where the Baird&#x27;s tapir is the national animal, it is known as the mountain cow.

In Mexico, it is called in Tzeltal; in Lacandon, it is called , meaning &quot;jungle horse&quot; and in Tojolab&#x27;al it is called , meaning &quot;big animal&quot;. In Panama, the Kunas people call the Baird&#x27;s tapir &quot;moli&quot; in their colloquial language (Tule kaya), &quot;oloalikinyalilele&quot;, &quot;oloswikinyaliler,&quot; or &quot;oloalikinyappi&quot; in their political language (Sakla kaya), and &quot;ekwirmakka&quot; or &quot;ekwilamakkatola&quot; in their spiritual language (Suar mimmi kaya).

== Habitat ==
The Baird&#x27;s tapir is found in many diverse vegetation types. They can withstand elevations from sea level to up to . The animal can be found in wet areas like mangrove forests, marshes, swamp areas, and wet tropical rainforests. It also resides in drier areas like riparian woodlands, deciduous forests, and mountainous cloud forests. It prefers secondary growth forests, when available, due to increase in understory plants for foraging and protection. Food and water availability as well as protection are key factors in habitat selection.

==Description==
The Baird&#x27;s tapir has a distinctive cream-colored marking on its face, throat, and tips of its ears, with a dark spot on each cheek, behind and below the eye. The rest of its bristly hair is dark brown or grayish brown. The animal is very muscly, and about the size of a small donkey. A long thin mane is present but not always conspicuous. It has two small oval shaped eyes flush with the side of the head. Its ears are large, oval-shaped and not very mobile. Baird&#x27;s tapirs average in length, but can range between , not counting a stubby, vestigial tail of , and in height. Body mass in adults can range from . Like the other species of tapirs, they have small, stubby tails. Their snout and upper lips project forward to create a fleshy and flexible proboscis. This proboscis is their strongest sense organ that aids in finding food and detecting physical stimuli. Their legs are short and slender; well adapted to rapid movement through underbrush. They have four toes on each front foot, and three toes on each back foot.

==Lifecycle==

The gestation period is about 400 days, after which one offspring is born to an average mass of . Multiple births are extremely rare, but in September 2020, a Baird&#x27;s tapir in Boston&#x27;s Franklin Park Zoo birthed twins.
The babies, as with all species of tapir, have reddish-brown hair with white spots and stripes. This pattern creates a camouflage which affords them excellent protection in the shady understory of the forest. This pattern eventually fades into the adult coloration.

For the first week of their lives, infant Baird&#x27;s tapirs are hidden in secluded locations while their mothers forage for food and return periodically to nurse them. Later, the young follow their mothers on feeding expeditions. At three weeks of age, the young are able to swim. Weaning occurs after one year, and sexual maturity is usually reached 6 to 12 months later. Baird&#x27;s tapirs can live for over 30 years.

==Behavior==

The Baird&#x27;s tapir may be active at all hours, but is primarily nocturnal. It forages for leaves and fallen fruit, using well-worn tapir paths which zigzag through the thick undergrowth of the forest. The animal usually stays close to water and enjoys swimming and wading – on especially hot days, individuals will rest in a watering hole for hours with only their heads above water. When in danger, these animals will seek water.

It generally leads a solitary life, though small feeding groups are not uncommon, and individuals, especially those of different ages (young with their mothers, juveniles with adults), are often observed together. The animals communicate with one another through shrill whistles and squeaks.

When the Baird&#x27;s tapir mate, they form long-term monogamous pairs. These pairs are known to defend territory. Though they can breed at any point in the year, it is most common prior to rainy seasons. Both parents take part in raising the children, as they move and sleep together as a unit. The mother will guide young by a nudging movement with her proboscis.

The Baird&#x27;s tapir has a symbiotic relationship with cleaner birds that remove ticks from its fur: the yellow-headed caracara (&quot;Milvago chimachima&quot;) and the black vulture (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;) have both been observed removing and eating ticks from tapirs. Baird&#x27;s tapirs often lie down for cleaning, and also present tick-infested areas to the cleaner birds by lifting its limbs and rolling from one side to the other.

These animals also have a marginal but noted effect as seed dispersers. Guanacaste (&quot;Enterolobium cyclocarpum)&quot;, Sapodilla (&quot;Manilkara zapota&quot;), and Encina (&quot;Quercus oleoides&quot;) have all found to be sometimes passable through the tapir digestive system. The intense chewing of these hard seeds serve to scarify them before germination and can improve the seed&#x27;s likelihood of success.

=== Diet ===
The Baird&#x27;s tapir is herbivorous, rummaging from the forest floor to over the ground. Leaves from an assortment of plant types provide the greater part of their eating regimen, yet they likewise eat twigs, blossoms, hedges, grasses, and fruits. Fruits tend to be favorable when in season, but it depends on its availability. Dietary makeup of plant species additionally fluctuates with season. The presence of armor or biting insects on a plant does not hinder them from consuming that plant. They burn through the majority of their waking hours foraging in a zigzag fashion.

These animals lean toward plant types of medium to tall level, yet the main plants that are totally kept away from are small, widely dispersed seedlings and large shade-level trees. By and large, it will move onto another plant before each of the leaves are consumed on the one it is presently eating. They commonly feed in enormous tree falls or secondary forests because of the great thickness of understory plants which are for, the most part, exceptionally digestible and have not many protective poisons. Once in a while they will ascend on their rear feet to arrive at leaves past their ordinary reach, or knock down slim or dead plants to get fruit or leaves. The absorption of nutrients in light of the huge volume and extreme diversity of recognizable plant parts in their excrement is by all accounts poor.

===Potential danger to humans===
Attacks on humans are rare and normally in self-defense. In 2006, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez Echandi, the former Costa Rican Minister of Environment and Energy, was attacked and injured by a Baird&#x27;s tapir after he followed it off the trail.

Due to their size, adults can be potentially dangerous to humans, and should not be approached if spotted in the wild. The animal is most likely to follow or chase a human for a bit, though they have been known to charge and bite humans on rare occasions.

== Threats ==
According to the IUCN, the Baird&#x27;s tapir is endangered. There are many contributing factors in the decline of the species, including loss of habitat from deforestation, forest fires, and large scale industrial projects. In certain areas, poaching, disease transmission from domesticated animals, pollution of native water bodies, and the developing effects of climate change all threaten this species. Though the animal is only hunted by a few humans, any loss of life is a serious blow to the tapir population, especially because their reproductive rate is so slow.

== Conservation ==
In Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama, hunting of the Baird&#x27;s tapirs is illegal, but the laws protecting them are often unenforced. The issues of illegal logging in conserved areas also threaten these animals. Therefore, many conservationists are urging for the protection of existing habitat by improving maintenance and protection in existing habitat, through strengthening partnership with indigenous territories. Goals also include re-establishing corridors of connection between existing habitat including the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, and improving education of locals to uphold and protect biodiversity.

Captive breeding programs are helpful with many large terrestrial species, but there is a study showing a small population of Baird&#x27;s tapirs in North American and Central American zoos had inbreeding and divergence from the wild population. Conservationists are urging for thoughtful approaches to breeding programs that focus on maintaining genetic diversity.

==Predators==
Due to its size, an adult Baird&#x27;s tapir has very few natural predators, with only large adult American crocodiles ( or more) and adult jaguars capable of preying on Baird&#x27;s tapirs. Even in these cases, the outcomes are unpredictable and often in the Baird&#x27;s tapir&#x27;s favor, as is evident on multiple Baird&#x27;s tapirs documented in Corcovado National Park with large claw marks covering their hides. However, juveniles may be preyed on by smaller crocodiles and by pumas. In a remote video-monitor, a spectacled bear was captured attacking an adult tapir perhaps nearly twice its own body mass.

<doc id="966876" wikidata="Q5021012" url="?curid=966876" title="California State Capitol Museum">
<text>The California State Capitol Museum consists of a museum in and grounds around the California State Capitol in Sacramento, California, United States. The building has been the home of the California State Legislature since 1869. The State Capitol Museum has been a property in the California State Parks system since 1982.

==Capitol Museum==
While the entire building may be considered a museum, the heart of the Capitol Museum can be found on the basement and first floor of the original section of the building. In the basement can be found the tour office (B-27), a small theater showing several short films on the history of the Capitol, the gift shop, and the Arthur Mathews mural, the &quot;History of California.&quot; On the first floor, visitors can tour the restored historic offices of the Secretary of State, Treasurer, and Governor of California, as well as two rotating exhibit rooms.

From 1883 to 2020, the center of the rotunda housed the marble statue &quot;Columbus&#x27; Last Appeal to Queen Isabella&quot;, sculpted by Larkin Mead and given to California by banker and philanthropist Darius Ogden Mills. A June 2020 joint statement by California Senate Pro Tempore Toni Atkins, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, and Assembly Rules Committee chair Ken Cooley said that the removal of the statue was based on “the deadly impact his arrival in this hemisphere had on indigenous populations.&quot; It was removed on July 7, 2020.

==Capitol Park==

There are of gardens in the surrounding Capitol Park, including trees and shrubs from around the world. There are approximately 1140 trees in the park (not including shrubs) representing over 200 types of trees.

The grounds also feature approximately 155 memorials to significant events and people involving California, and other points-of-interest. Only a selection are listed below, grouped by section, roughly from west to east (9th Street to 15th Street), and then from north (L Street) to south (N Street) within each section:

Between 9th and 10th streets:
* The Earl Warren Walk, dedicated to the former Governor and Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, marks the path he wore on his walks from the Capitol to the Sutter Club.
* El Soldado Tribute to Mexican American Soldiers of World War II, created at the behest of the Sociedad de Madres Mexicanas, Gold Star mothers.
* The California Peace Officer&#x27;s Memorial, honoring those officers who have died in the line of duty and remembering those they left behind.

Between 10th and 11th streets:
* California Registered Historical Landmark No. 872, denoting the Capitol Complex as landmark.
* The Great Seal of the State of California, cast in bronze and placed at the west steps in 1952, was followed by the Native American and Spanish-Mexican Commemorative seals in 2002.
* The Capitol Cornerstone, near the north entrance, placed in 1978 to replace the original 1861 cornerstone.
* The Apollo 14 Moon Tree, planted as a sapling in 1976 that was grown from a seed (among hundreds) carried by command module pilot Stuart Roosa during the 1971 mission.
* The Sisters of Mercy Memorial, honoring the religious order which arrived in Sacramento in 1857 to care for the children of miners and to serve the sick and homeless. The land they purchased for the site of a school eventually became the site of the Capitol.
* The September 11 Memorial, including a plaque and three rose bushes, dedicated on the one year anniversary of the attacks.
* The California Civil War Veterans plaque, located at the east entrance, dedicated in 1963 to California veterans of that conflict.
* The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Marker, placed in 1888, is located at 38°34&#x27;35&quot;N by 121°29&#x27;33&quot;W.
* The Senator Capitol Kitty Memorial, remembering the beloved feline resident of Capitol Park.
Between 11th and 12th streets:
* The Pioneer Camellia Grove created in 1942 by the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West in tribute to the pioneers of the city and county of Sacramento.
* A life-sized statue of Junípero Serra, a Roman Catholic missionary sent by Spain to help colonize California. At its base is a map of California&#x27;s 21 missions, from San Diego to Sonoma.
* Behind Serra&#x27;s statue stands an El Camino Real Commemorative Bell, placed by the California Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs and the California State Automobile Association to celebrate the placing of the original bells along the route in 1906 by the CFWC.
* The Civil War Memorial Grove planted in 1897 with saplings from famous Civil War battlefields.
* Within the grove stands the Reverend Thomas Starr King Memorial, originally one of two statues representing California in Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, but replaced in 2009 by Governor and President Ronald Reagan.
* The Spanish War Veterans Memorial, commonly called &quot;The Hiker,&quot; after the appearance of the uniform.
* The ship&#x27;s bell from , the only dreadnaught-type battleship built on the Pacific Coast. Sunk at Pearl Harbor, she was raised, refitted, and rejoined the fleet in 1944.
* The reproduction of the Liberty Bell, one of fifty-three replicas cast in 1953 as part of a nationwide savings bond drive.
* The World War I Memorial Trees, planted in 1921 in memory of the unknown first California soldier to die in that conflict.
* The Governor Hiram W. Johnson Memorial Parkway, dedicated to the progressive and conservationist Governor.
* The California Department of Transportation Highway Workers Memorial, remembering those CalTrans workers killed in work-related incidents.
* Y-ET-IM TEH-LEI-LI California Indian Grinding Rock

Between 13th and 14th streets:
* The Insectary, constructed in 1908 as a research facility, is now used as a service area for the Department of General Services groundskeeping crew.
* The California Firefighters Memorial erected to honor the fallen firefighter.
* The California Veterans Memorial, a granite obelisk honoring California Veterans from the Mexican–American War, Civil War, Spanish–American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War.
* By the Veterans Memorial stands the Purple Heart Monument, in honor of those veterans killed, wounded, or disabled in combat.

Between 14th and 15th streets:
* The California Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with life-size bronze figures of service men and women depicting military life in Vietnam and featuring engravings of names of Californians killed or missing in action.
* The World Peace Rose Garden, a 0.42 acre garden with about 650 roses in over 140 varieties of colors and fragrances on display.
* The California Native Plant Section, created in 1911 with the efforts of the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West, planted almost exclusively with flora native to the state.

<text>WLBT (channel 3) is a television station in Jackson, Mississippi, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Gray Media, which also operates American Spirit Media–owned Fox affiliate WDBD (channel 40) and Vicksburg-licensed MyNetworkTV outlet WLOO (channel 35) under shared services agreements (SSAs). WLOO&#x27;s license is owned by Tougaloo College, with American Spirit actually operating the station through a separate joint sales agreement (JSA); in turn, Gray provides WLOO with limited engineering support. The three stations share studios on South Jefferson Street in downtown Jackson; WLBT&#x27;s transmitter is located on Thigpen Road southeast of Raymond, Mississippi.

Originally a pro-segregationist station, in 1969, it became the first station stripped of its right to broadcast for failing to serve the public interest. It was then relaunched under different ownership, becoming a pioneer in racial equality among Southern broadcasters.

==History==
The station was founded on December 19, 1953, as WJBT by the Lamar Life Insurance Company, owners of radio station WJDX. It is Jackson&#x27;s second-oldest television station, following WJTV (channel 12), which debuted in January 1953. Channel 3 is also Mississippi&#x27;s third-oldest television station (now-sister station WTOK-TV in Meridian went on the air three months earlier). A few weeks after its debut, the station was renamed WLBT—which stands for Lamar Broadcasting Television—because the original call letters sounded similar to WJTV.

It has always been an NBC affiliate, given WJDX&#x27;s affiliation with that network, though it shared ABC with WJTV until WAPT (channel 16) started broadcasting in 1970. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

===Opposition to civil rights===

The station gained notoriety for its aggressive support of racial segregation in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s. Lamar had close ties to the state&#x27;s white political and business elite and with segregationist groups, such as the White Citizens&#x27; Council. Indeed, a number of station executives, including general manager Fred Beard, were Citizens&#x27; Council members. It went as far as to coordinate opposition to civil rights with these groups. For instance, the station allowed the WCC to operate a bookstore in the lobby of its studios in downtown Jackson. Station manager Fred Beard editorialized on the air against the admission of James Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962, arguing that states should determine who should and should not be allowed to attend their schools.

For the most part, the station ignored the Civil Rights Movement, cutting out coverage of it from the NBC News feed (largely by pretending that technical problems were the cause of interruptions). The station provided a platform on its local newscasts and public affairs programs for individuals advocating resistance to efforts by the federal government to integrate public schools and allow African-Americans to vote. It also preempted NBC programs that even mildly referred to racial justice or featured African-American actors prominently. In 1955, when civil rights lawyer Thurgood Marshall—later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court—appeared on &quot;The Today Show&quot;, WLBT interrupted the interview, putting up a sign that said, &quot;Sorry, Cable Trouble.&quot; Beard later declared he had pulled the interview, saying that television networks had become instruments of &quot;Negro propaganda&quot;.

Owners and staffers at several other television stations in the South did not like network coverage of the Civil Rights Movement, including WBRC-TV in Birmingham, Alabama, WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, and WUSN-TV (now WCBD-TV) in Charleston, South Carolina. Although some Southern stations severed their ties with their networks in order to prevent being forced to air coverage of the movement (WRAL and WUSN both switched from NBC to ABC in 1962), WLBT kept its affiliation with NBC, even though that network historically had an extremely low tolerance towards local preemptions at the time. Indeed, many NBC stars, like &quot;Bonanza&#x27;s&quot; Michael Landon and Pernell Roberts, were speaking out on behalf of civil rights. This was largely because WLBT&#x27;s only competition was CBS affiliate WJTV, a situation that lasted until 1970, when the market picked up a full-time ABC affiliate in WAPT.

Over the years, NBC—along with civil rights groups and the work of Rev. Everett Parker of the United Church of Christ (UCC)—sent numerous petitions to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complain of WLBT&#x27;s flagrant bias. The FCC issued several warnings to Lamar, but these went unheeded. Finally, in 1964, Rev. Parker and the UCC&#x27;s Office of Communication formally petitioned the FCC to revoke WLBT&#x27;s license. The FCC ruled that the petitioners had no standing because they had no economic interest in the station or were not subject to electronic interference from WLBT&#x27;s signal. The UCC appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In 1966, the court, in an opinion by Warren Burger, later to become Chief Justice of the United States, ruled that the public had the right to take part in FCC hearings in order to protect the public interest.

By this time, WLBT had taken a few steps to change its segregationist image. It had fired Beard, hired some black announcers and began airing black church services. At a new hearing held in 1967, the FCC again ruled in favor of Lamar. The UCC again appealed to the Appeals Court, which found Lamar&#x27;s record to be beyond repair and ordered the FCC to revoke Lamar&#x27;s license in 1969. Lamar appealed, but lost in 1971. To this day, WLBT remains one of only two television stations that has ever lost its license for violating FCC regulations on fairness. The other station, WJIM-TV (now WLNS-TV) in Lansing, Michigan, had its license reinstated on appeal.

While hearings were held for a permanent licensee, the FCC gave control of the station to a bi-racial, non-profit foundation called &quot;Communications Improvement, Inc.&quot; The group promised to make the station a beacon of tolerance. A new group of managers, including some of the first African American television executives in the South, recreated the station as a far more neutral news source. However, it retained the WLBT callsign and claimed the original station&#x27;s history as its own. It also retained the NBC affiliation and most of its employees.

In 1973, the FCC was asked to revoke WLBT&#x27;s broadcast license because the station&#x27;s largest shareholder, William Mounger, also served as a Jackson Academy Vice President. The FCC filing stated that, since Mounger was affiliated with a segregation academy, he was not fit to hold a broadcast license. In 1974, the FCC rejected the complaint on the grounds that the complaint was untimely since the evidence of Mounger&#x27;s association with the school and the school&#x27;s discriminatory practices was available from at least 1969.

===WLBT today===
WLBT was one of the first television stations in the South to devote a significant block of airtime and dedicated personnel to the production of local investigative, documentary-style news—these blocks typically aired during off-network hours. &quot;Probe&quot; was a 30-minute program that aired weekly. It garnered numerous awards, including a George Foster Peabody award in 1976 for a segment called &quot;Power Politics in Mississippi&quot;.

As the hearings dragged out through the 1970s, the five competing groups concluded that nothing was to be gained from further proceedings. They merged as TV-3, Inc., a consortium with Blacks holding controlling interest and headed by a majority-Black board. The merged group was awarded the license in late 1979, and took control of the station on January 9, 1980. In 1984, Civic Communications, one of the five groups that won the full license, bought out its partners and became sole owner of the station. Frank Melton, who later became mayor of Jackson, became CEO.

From 1982 to 1991, the station operated a low-power satellite in Meridian, Mississippi, WLBM; that station is now a stand-alone station, WGBC.

In 2000, Melton sold the station to Liberty Corporation. Even with the station&#x27;s growth over the last two decades (see below), the growing trend toward consolidation in the media industry made it difficult for Melton to buy stronger syndicated programming or sell advertising. Liberty in turn merged with Raycom Media in 2006.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WLBT, WDBD and WLOO), and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under Gray&#x27;s corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion – in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – resulted in WLBT gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including CBS/ABC affiliate KNOE-TV in Monroe, Louisiana, and ABC affiliate WTOK-TV in Meridian. The combined company would be in every Mississippi market except for Greenville and Columbus–Tupelo as a result. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.

==Tower collapse==
On October 23, 1997, three Canadian men from Canada&#x27;s LeBlanc &amp; Royal were preparing to replace the guy wires of WLBT&#x27;s transmission tower near Raymond when the tower collapsed, killing them. The workers were at the level and held on to the tower as it fell.

The tower&#x27;s collapse knocked WLBT and the local PBS/Mississippi ETV Network station WMPN off the air for several hours. WLBT was able to resume broadcasting on a secondary tower, which only reached about half of its normal viewing area until a new tower was completed in 1999.

The 1,999-foot tower was actually the second WLBT transmission tower to fall at their Raymond site. WLBT&#x27;s original transmission tower collapsed on March 3, 1966, when the Candlestick Park Tornado, one of only two F5 tornadoes in Mississippi&#x27;s history, struck the tower and transmitter building. WLBT engineers salvaged what they could of the transmitter and operated on the same stand by tower as it would operate with later after the second tower collapse. When the replacement tower was completed later in 1966, the new tower was one of the tallest structures east of the Mississippi River and was in service until the second collapse in 1997.

==Programming==
There were two noteworthy preemptions made by WLBT after the start of its 1971 license. One was the miniseries &quot;Freedom Road&quot; (which was filmed in nearby Natchez) and another was the short-lived animated sitcom &quot;God, the Devil and Bob&quot;. The latter was mostly preempted due to the controversy it stirred within the religious community.

On December 30, 2023, WLBT parent company Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with the New Orleans Pelicans to air 10 games on the station during the 2023–24 season.

On September 17, 2024, Gray and the Pelicans announced a broader deal to form the Gulf Coast Sports &amp; Entertainment Network, which will broadcast nearly all 2024–25 Pelicans games on Gray&#x27;s stations in the Gulf South, including WLBT.

===News operation===
For most of the last 30 years, WLBT has been the dominant news station in Jackson. It currently has the market&#x27;s only helicopter used for breaking news gathering and traffic reports. The station launched a weekday afternoon 4 p.m. newscast in March 2008; this was the first of its kind in Jackson. In October 2010, WLBT began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition becoming the second television outlet in the area to make the upgrade.

After American Spirit Media completed its acquisition of WDBD and entered into the shared services agreement with WLBT, the Fox station&#x27;s news department was shut down resulting in several members of the WDBD staff being laid-off. Production of its newscasts was assumed by WLBT on November 12, 2012, with all of the news programming retained (except for the 10 p.m. show on WUFX, now WLOO, since it would compete with WLBT). In addition, WDBD added Saturday and Sunday editions of its prime time broadcast at 9.

All newscasts on WDBD currently originate from WLBT&#x27;s primary set at the South Jefferson Street studios except with separate on-air duratrans and graphics indicating the Fox-branded newscasts. Although it shares a majority of on-air personnel with WLBT, WDBD maintains a separate additional news anchor for the weekday morning and weeknight shows. WLBT and WDBD operate a combined news department under the &quot;Mississippi News Now&quot; branding very similar to Raycom partnerships in Tucson, Arizona (with Tegna-owned KMSB) and Toledo, Ohio (with WUPW; those stations are no longer sisters of WLBT).

====Notable former on-air staff====
* Woodie Assaf – weather reporter from 1953 to 2001, making him the longest serving weather reporter in the United States (deceased)
* Randall Pinkston – reporter and anchor from 1971 to 1974; now CBS News correspondent

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WLBT shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated its pre-transition to VHF channel 7, using virtual channel 3.

On January 14, 2010, WLBT moved to UHF channel 30, because of viewers having difficulty receiving their signal on VHF channel 7. Some stations solved the problem with the power increase, but WLBT could not due to potential interference to another station. The former channel 7 transmitter was later moved to its sister station in Laurel–Hattiesburg, WDAM-TV.

<doc id="966880" wikidata="Q796582" url="?curid=966880" title="BMW M54">
<text>The BMW M54 is a naturally aspirated straight-6 DOHC petrol engine produced from 2000 to 2006. It was released in the E53 X5 and is the replacement for the M52 engine. The S54 is the equivalent high performance engine, used in the E46 M3, the Z3 M Coupé/Roadster and the E85/E86 Z4 M. The BMW M56 SULEV engine (sold in several states of the United States) is based on the M54.

The M54 was phased out following the introduction of the BMW N52 engine in 2004. From 2001 to 2003, the M54 was included on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list.

== Design ==
Compared with the final versions of its M52 predecessor (called the &#x27;M52TÜ&#x27;), the M54 has a non-return fuel system, a fully electronic throttle (without mechanical backup), Siemens MS 43 engine management, and a revised intake manifold. The displacement of the largest variant increased from 2.8 L to , due to an increase in stroke to .

As per the M52TÜ, the M54 uses an aluminium block and aluminium cylinder head with cast iron cylinder liners. Variable valve timing is fitted to both camshafts (called &quot;double-VANOS&quot;), a dual length intake manifold (called &quot;DISA&quot;) is used and the thermostat is electronically controlled. The redline remains at 6,500 rpm.

There was no &quot;technical update&quot; (TÜ) version of the M54 produced, therefore the engine specifications remained the same throughout its seven-year production run.

== Versions ==
===M54B22===
The M54B22 produces at 6,100 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. Bore is , stroke is and the compression ratio is 10.8:1.

;Applications
* 2000–2006 E46 320i, 320Ci
* 2000–2003 E39 520i
* 2000–2002 E36/7 Z3 2.2i
* 2003–2005 E85 Z4 2.2i
* 2003–2005 E60/E61 520i

===M54B25===
The M54B25 produces at 6,000 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. Bore is , stroke is and the compression ratio is 10.5:1.

;Applications
* 2000–2002 E36/7 Z3 2.5i

* 2002–2005 E85 Z4 2.5i

===M54B30===
The M54B30 is the largest M54 variant and produces at 5,900 rpm and at 3,500 rpm. Bore is , stroke is and the compression ratio is 10.2:1.

In the United States and Canada, a &quot;ZHP&quot; version of the M54B30 used different camshafts and reprogrammed engine management to develop at 5,900 rpm and at 3,500 rpm and have a slightly higher redline of 6,800 rpm (although the Canadian cars still show the limiter at 6,500 rpm on the tachometer).

The M54B30 was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list through 2001–2003.

;Applications
* 2000–2006 E46 330i, 330xi, 330Ci
* 2000–2004 E39 530i
* 2000–2002 E36/7 Z3 3.0i

* 2002–2005 E65/E66 730i, 730Li
* 2000–2002 Wiesmann MF 30

==S54==
The S54 was marketed as the high performance equivalent to the M54, however it is actually more an evolution of the BMW S50 and shares few parts with the M54. As per the S50, the engine block is made of cast iron, unlike the aluminium engine block used by the M54. Redline is 8,000 rpm.

Compared with the S50, the S54 features:
* Bore increased to , resulting in a displacement of 
* Revised camshafts
* Finger follower valve actuation instead of bucket-style tappets
* Compression ratio increased from 11.3:1 to 11.5:1
* Siemens MSS54 engine control unit (MSS70 in the later Z4 M)
* Electronic throttle control
* Scavenging oil pump to avoid oil starvation during cornering (this was also present on the S50B30 of the E36 M3 GT and the S50B32, but not the regular S50B30)

There is no direct successor to the S54, since the following generation E90/E92/E93 M3 was powered by the V8 BMW S65 engine.

===S54B32===
Variations in power and torque outputs are often due to country-specific emissions regulations, or space constraints of a chassis affecting the layout of the intake/exhaust system.

;Applications
* 2000–2006 E46 M3 — produces at 7,900 rpm and at 4,900 rpm. Models for the United States and Canada produce and .
* 2000–2002 E36/7 Z3 M Roadster, E36/8 M Coupé — produces and . Models for the United States and Canada produce and .
* 2002–2011 Wiesmann MF 3 Roadster — produces and .
* 2006–2008 E85 Z4 M Roadster, E86 Z4 M Coupé — produces and - Engine code 326S4. Models for the United States and Canada produce and . The Z4 M&#x27;s engine uses a Siemens MSS70 control unit.

===S54B32HP===

An upgraded version of the S54 engine was used in the E46 M3 CSL. This engine is designated S54B32HP and the changes include a revised intake made from carbon fiber, revised camshafts, a MAP sensor (instead of the MAF sensor used in the regular S54), a lightweight exhaust manifold with a straighter air path (which later became standard on the regular S54) and a straightened intake manifold.

;Applications
* 2003 E46 M3 CSL , 
* 2009 Wiesmann MF 3 Roadster &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; — produces ,

<doc id="966885" wikidata="Q5226223" url="?curid=966885" title="Daryl Reid">
<text>Daryl Gary Reid, (born November 2, 1950) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He represented the electoral division of Transcona in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 2016, serving as a member of the New Democratic Party, and was the speaker of the Legislative Assembly from October 2011 to March 2016.

==Early life and career==
Reid was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to a family that was politically active with the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation and New Democratic Party. He began working for Canadian National in 1969 and became active in the trade union movement, serving as a shop steward and executive board member for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. From 1986 to 1990, he was the national president of his railway employees&#x27; association.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==

Reid was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Richard Kozak. The Progressive Conservative Party won a majority government in this election, and Reid served as his party&#x27;s critic for Transportation and the Workers&#x27; Compensation Board. In the latter capacity, he called for the WCB to adopt universal coverage. He later spoke against a proposed merger of Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, and strongly opposed the federal government&#x27;s decision to privatize Canadian National.

Reid was re-elected without difficulty in the 1995 election, winning every poll in the Transcona division. The Progressive Conservatives were re-elected to another majority government, and Reid served as his party&#x27;s critic for Transportation and Labour.

After eleven years in opposition, the New Democratic Party was returned to government in the 1999 provincial election. Reid was easily re-elected in Transcona, and became a backbench supporter of Gary Doer&#x27;s administration. He led a task force into Manitoba&#x27;s system of issuing driver&#x27;s licenses, and chaired a series of public meetings into the status of the province&#x27;s roads, rails and runways. Re-elected again in 2003, he chaired the committees that selected a new ombudsman and a new auditor general for Manitoba.

In 2005, Reid and fellow NDP MLA Bidhu Jha broke ranks with the Doer government and spoke against plans to create a new hog processing plant in their section of Winnipeg. After extensive criticism, the government withdrew its support for the project in 2007.

Reid was returned for a fifth time in the 2007 election, in which the NDP were re-elected to a third consecutive majority government. He now chairs the 2020 Manitoba Transportation Task Force, and serves on the board of directors of the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation.

==Federal politics==

Reid supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995. In 2003, he endorsed Bill Blaikie.

<text>James Walker Tufts (February 11, 1835 – February 3, 1902) is known for his founding of Pinehurst, North Carolina and for his development of a successful business in silver plate tableware. He also founded the Arctic Soda Fountain Co. and eventually merged with A. D. Puffer &amp; Sons (Boston, Massachusetts), John Matthews (New York City, New York), and Charles Lippincott (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) to form the American Soda Fountain Co. Tufts was the inventor of the Arctic Soda Fountain and was installed as the first president of the merger that formed American Soda Fountain.

==Biography==
Tufts was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts on February 11, 1835, to Leonard Tufts and Hepzebah Fosdick Tufts. He was &quot;an entrepreneur, inventor, and philanthropist. He rose from being a sixteen-year-old drug store apprentice to becoming a wealthy businessman who had the vision and determination to build Pinehurst, in only six months.&quot; In 1895, Tufts initially purchased , and eventually purchased an additional , of land for approximately $1.25 per acre in the North Carolina Sandhills, with the vision of building a &quot;health resort for people of modest means&quot;. Originally dubbed &quot;Tuftstown&quot; during development, Tuftstown became the village of Pinehurst, and home of the Pinehurst Resort—the name was chosen from a list of losing names proposed for Oak Bluffs on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, formerly known as Cottage City. James Walker Tufts was a prominent summer resident of Cottage City.

Tufts hired the landscape architecture firm started by Frederick Law Olmsted to do the initial city planning; because his health was failing, Olmsted himself was unable to play an active role.

Pinehurst later became known for its golf courses with the arrival of golf pro Donald Ross (originally of Dornoch, Scotland) in December, 1900. Ross designed four of Pinehurst&#x27;s golf courses.

Tufts died in Pinehurst on February 2, 1902. Pinehurst was controlled by the Tufts family until 1970. James Tufts&#x27;s son Leonard, and his grandson, Richard, succeeded him.

Born in Rivne, Ukraine (then in Poland), Spivak received a Bachelor of Arts, Honours Degree in Political Science and Philosophy from the University of Manitoba.

She was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1986 as a Progressive Conservative (PC). She refused to join the Conservative Party of Canada when the PC Party merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2003 and subsequently left the Conservative caucus to sit in the Senate as an independent on February 3, 2004.

<text>(Shadow of Destiny in North America) is a mystery adventure game developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo and published by Konami. Originally released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001, it was later ported to Xbox (which is only released in Europe) and Microsoft Windows in 2002. A PlayStation Portable version was released on October 1, 2009 in Japan and on January 26, 2010 in North America.

==Gameplay==
The objective of &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; is to guide player character Eike Kusch through the fictional German town of Lebensbaum (Life&#x27;s Tree) as he travels through time to prevent and unmask his murderer. The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue. In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the non-player character Homunculus, and travels back in time before his death with the intent of changing events to prevent it. &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; lacks traditional action elements, and Eike cannot attack nor does he have a bar displaying his health. The digipad, a time-traveling item given to Eike by Homunculus, requires energy units, which the player can find scattered around the town. The gameplay primarily consists of time-traveling through the different eras, finding items, and interacting through dialogue with the non-player characters. Actions taken in one time period affect future ones; for example, if Eike removes a seal from the squire&#x27;s manor in 1580, the seal will not appear in the present era.

Additionally, the game keeps two digital clocks: one depicting the time in the present-day era and another for whichever era Eike time-travels to. The amount of time Eike spends in the different eras also passes in the present-day one. The cut-scenes and dialogue takes up varying amounts of in-game time. When the clock arrives at the time of Eike&#x27;s death, the chapter restarts, however, if Eike is not in his time period at the time of his death, the game ends.

== Plot ==
Set in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (The Tree of Life), &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus, a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1979/1980, 1902 and 1580 to 1584 — as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarete; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus&#x27; instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner&#x27;s experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother&#x27;s death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player&#x27;s actions, Hugo holds either Margarete or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone, to resurrect his mother.

===Endings===
&quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; contains eight endings to the plot, with six available at first, the last two being unlocked by achieving the first six. In the first six endings, Eike discovers that Homunculus was using him to ensure that he would be &quot;created&quot; (actually unsealed) by Wagner and returns the digipad to him, with the fifth timeline/ending revealing that Wagner is actually a rejuvenated Eike who was cursed with both immortality and amnesia by the very Homunculus in retaliation for being resealed back into the stone. The last two endings (EX Endings) have Eike retaining all of his memories from the previous timelines, obtained the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone from the diner much earlier and either gives Dr. Wagner the stone to successfully cure Helena or throwing it at the Homunculus, erasing him from existence upon contact. Both resulted in Eike disappearing, with the final scene showing a possible descendant or reincarnation of Eike in present-day walking through the streets like in the beginning of the game, with the difference that rather than being stabbed, he was hit by a soccer ball unharmed, and returns the ball to a boy who may either be Hugo&#x27;s descendant or reincarnation.

==Development==
Developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, a playable demo of &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; debuted at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2000. The game went through several development titles: &quot;The Day and Night of Walpurgisnacht&quot;, &quot;Days of Walpurgis&quot;, and &quot;Time Adventure&quot;. Konami released &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot; for the PlayStation 2 in Japan on February 22, 2001, in North America on March 8, 2001 (retitled as &quot;Shadow of Destiny&quot;), and in Europe on March 30, 2001. In 2002, the now-defunct Runecraft company ported it to the PC, while an Xbox port appeared simultaneously in Europe and Australasia; a PlayStation Portable port arrived in 2009.

==Reception and legacy==
The PlayStation 2 version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the PC and PSP versions received &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot; according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Kevin Rice of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the former console version, &quot;Good adventure games on consoles are rare, and even if you normally don&#x27;t like adventure games, this one is worth checking out. It lures players in like few others in recent memory.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the PS2 version a score of 30 out of 40.

Reviewers praised the overall plot as the game&#x27;s strength, especially on PlayStation 2. &quot;IGN&quot;″s David Zdyrko called the story &quot;one of the deepest and most engaging that has ever been told through a videogame.&quot; Andrew Vestal of &quot;GameSpot&quot; enjoyed the idea of the detective in a murder mystery as the intended victim. Writing for &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, Shawn Sanders liked the time-traveling aspect of the game. Johnny Minkley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine called it &quot;a brilliantly conceived, wonderfully executed game.&quot;

The graphics of the PS2 version received mixed responses. Sanders found the textures of the game &quot;clean and detailed&quot;. Zdyrko disliked the low amount of detail on the characters and some of the background, but enjoyed the &quot;lighting and particle effects&quot;, particularly the snow and night. Vestal praised the different visual depictions of Lebensbaum, and felt that high level of detail in the backgrounds helped to somewhat counterbalance the low-resolution of the game&#x27;s graphics. Critics agreed that the full motion videos were well-done, and praised the realistic character animation. 
Critics commented on the general absence of action in the gameplay. Sanders considered it the game&#x27;s greatest flaw and a possible source of frustration for players. The slow beginning to the PS2 version was remarked on by critics, who felt that the game eventually picked up after a while. Additionally, the &quot;stiff&quot; motion of the protagonist when running drew criticism. Reviewers noted the relatively short play time, and felt that the multiple endings enhanced the game&#x27;s replay value.

The game&#x27;s soundtrack was well received. Critics wrote that it suited the mood and occasionally helped to build suspense. The voice acting also went over well, with several critics remarking on the quality of it. Zdyrko described it as &quot;first-class&quot; and believable, and commented that since much of the PS2 version consists of dialogue, flawed voice acting might have ruined the game. Vestal considered the voice acting of B-movie quality, but not flawed enough to be a major distraction.

Kevin Krause of &quot;GameZone&quot; gave the PlayStation 2 version eight out of ten, calling it &quot;a relatively short play, as it can easily be finished in one day.&quot; Jake The Snake of &quot;GamePro&quot; called it &quot;a worthwhile game, but just as you wouldn&#x27;t spend $50 for a DVD you&#x27;ve never seen, rent this first.&quot; Jon Thompson of &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it &quot;an outstanding adventure game in terms of thematic and narrative structure. Fans of the adventure genre and those are interested in something new should give this one a look. Those who would rather demolish enemies instead of sitting through countless conversations, however, should forget about solving Eike Kusch&#x27;s murder.&quot; However, Jason D&#x27;Aprile of &quot;Extended Play&quot; gave it two stars out of five, saying, &quot;The main, and probably only, draws to this adventure are some great story concepts and its minor replay value. &#x27;Shadow of Destiny&#x27; is a cool idea, but the lack of meaty gameplay, awful dialog, and a short game time make this a minor footnote in the history of the PlayStation2&#x27;s library. Let&#x27;s hope the next adventure for the system fares better.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; also gave the Japanese import four out of ten, saying, &quot;If the same amount of care had been placed in the game dynamic, &quot;Shadow Of Memories&quot; might have been less of a disappointment.&quot;

Mark H. Walker of &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; gave the PlayStation 2 version eight out of ten, calling it &quot;quality adventure gaming at its best.&quot; However, Bonnie later gave it 6.5 out of 10, saying, &quot;The game is a little bit tough to get into. The controls (mouse look and arrows keys to move) are a tad ungainly.&quot; Christina Gmiterko of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; gave the PC version three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that the gameplay is the high point here. Controlling Eike will be tedious for some and if you weren&#x27;t a fan of the 3D control in games like &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; or &quot;Gabriel Knight 3&quot;, you should steer clear of this one.&quot;

The PC version was nominated for the &quot;Best Adventure Game for PC&quot; award at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2002 Blister Awards, which went to both &quot;Syberia&quot; and &quot;Silent Hill 2&quot;. It was also nominated for the &quot;Best Adventure Game for PC&quot; Award at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2002 Awards, which also went to &quot;Syberia&quot;. The staff of the latter website called it &quot;one of the best PC adventure games to come around in some time&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; named it the 68th-best adventure game ever released.

===&quot;Time Hollow&quot;===
After &quot;Shadow of Memories&quot;, Kawano wrote and directed another game with a time-traveling element: the 2008 Nintendo DS title &quot;Time Hollow&quot;; it focuses on seventeen-year-old Ethan Kairos, who awakens in a world where his parents have been missing for twelve years, and his quest to find them. Along the way, he obtains the Hollow Pen, which allows him to create time portals to solve the mystery. &quot;Time Hollow&quot; continues the &quot;themes of time manipulation and paradoxes&quot;, for which Kawano has expressed an interest.

<text>The Russian River () is a river on the Kenai Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. It flows northward from Upper Russian Lake in the Kenai Mountains through Lower Russian Lake, draining into the Kenai River near the town of Cooper Landing. The native Denaina people called this river Chunuk&#x27;tnu.

Like the Kenai, the Russian River is famous for its fishing, especially for salmon. There are two runs of sockeye salmon each year, in mid-June and mid-July, and a run of silver salmon in August.

There is no direct road access to the river. It can be accessed either by hiking in from several Parking lots in the Russian River Campground (1/2 mile beyond Gwin&#x27;s Lodge at Milepost 52) or by the Russian River ferry that crosses the Kenai and takes fishermen to the mouth of the Russian. There is a parking and ferry fee. The first parking lot in the Russian River Campground (past the toll booth, lot on the left) is the 2.3 mile walk to the Russian River Falls. This is a moderate relatively flat walk to great viewing platforms of the falls. Bears frequently fish below the falls, and further down stream.

<text>Nafplio or Nauplio () is a coastal city located in the Peloponnese in Greece. It is the capital of the regional unit of Argolis and an important tourist destination. Founded in antiquity, the city became an important seaport in the Middle Ages during the Frankokratia as part of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, held initially by the de la Roche following the Fourth Crusade before coming under the Republic of Venice and, lastly, the Ottoman Empire. The city was the capital of the First Hellenic Republic and of the Kingdom of Greece, from 1827 until 1834.

==Name==
The name of the town changed several times over the centuries. The modern Greek name of the town is &quot;Nafplio&quot; (Ναύπλιο). In modern English, the most frequently used forms are &quot;Nauplia&quot; and &quot;Navplion&quot;.

The oldest reference to Nafplio appears to be in the so-called &quot;Aegean List&quot; from the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, dating to 14th century BCE, where it is recorded as ().

In Classical Antiquity, it was known as &quot;Nauplia&quot; (Ναυπλία) in Attic Greek and &quot;Naupliē&quot; (Ναυπλίη) in Ionian Greek. In Latin, it was called &quot;Nauplia&quot;.

During the Middle Ages, several variants were used in Byzantine Greek, including &quot;Náfplion&quot; (Ναύπλιον), &quot;Anáplion&quot; (Ἀνάπλιον), and &quot;Anáplia&quot; (Ἀνάπλια).

During the Late Middle Ages and early modern period, under Venetian domination, the town was known in Italian as &quot;Napoli di Romania&quot;, after the medieval usage of &quot;Romania&quot; to refer to the lands of the Byzantine Empire, and to distinguish it from &quot;Napoli&quot; (Naples) in Italy.

Also during the early modern period, but this time under Ottoman rule, the Turkish name of the town was &quot;Mora Yenişehir&quot;, after Morea, a medieval name for the Peloponnese, and &quot;yeni şehir&quot;, the Turkish term for &quot;new city&quot; (apparently a translation from the Greek Νεάπολη, Italian &quot;Napoli&quot;). The Ottomans also called it &quot;Anabolı&quot;.

In the 19th century and early 20th century, the town was called indiscriminately &quot;Náfplion&quot; (Ναύπλιον) and &quot;Nafplio&quot; (Ναύπλιο) in modern Greek. Both forms were used in official documents and travel guides. This explains why the old form &quot;Náfplion&quot; (sometimes transliterated to &quot;Navplion&quot;) still occasionally survives up to this day.

==Geography==
Nafplio is situated on the Argolic Gulf in the northeast Peloponnese. Most of the old town is on a peninsula jutting into the gulf; this peninsula forms a naturally protected bay that is enhanced by the addition of human-made moles. The city was originally almost isolated by marshes; landfill projects, primarily since the 1970s, have nearly doubled its land area.

==Municipality==
The municipality Nafplio was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Asini
*Midea
*Nafplio
*Nea Tiryntha

The municipality has an area of 390.241 km2, the municipal unit 33.619 km2. The municipal unit Nafplio consists of the communities Nafplio, Aria, Lefkakia and Pyrgiotika.

==Population==

==History==

===Mythical origins and Classical antiquity===
The area surrounding Nafplio has been inhabited since ancient times, but few signs of this, aside from the walls of the Acronauplia, remain visible. The town has been a stronghold on several occasions during Classical Antiquity. It seems to be mentioned on an Egyptian funerary inscription of Amenophis III as &quot;Nuplija&quot;. Nauplia () was the port of Argos, in ancient Argolis. It was situated upon a rocky peninsula, connected with the mainland by a narrow isthmus. It was a very ancient place, and is said to have derived its name from Nauplius, the son of Poseidon and Amymone, and the father of Palamedes, though it more probably owed its name, as Strabo has observed, to its harbour. Pausanias tells us that the Nauplians were Egyptians belonging to the colony which Danaus brought to Argos; and from the position of their city upon a promontory running out into the sea, which is quite different from the site of the earlier Grecian cities, it is not improbable that it was originally a settlement made by strangers from the East.

Nauplia was at first independent of Argos, and a member of the maritime confederacy which held its meetings in the island of Calaureia. About the time of the Second Messenian War, it was conquered by the Argives; and the Lacedaemonians gave to its expelled citizens the town of Methone in Messenia, where they continued to reside even after the restoration of the Messenian state by the Theban general Epaminondas. Argos then took the place of Nauplia in the Calaureian confederacy; and from this time Nauplia appears in history only as the seaport of Argos. As such it is mentioned by Strabo, but in the time of Pausanias (2nd century) the place was deserted. Pausanias noticed the ruins of the walls of a temple of Poseidon, certain forts, and a fountain named Canathus, by washing in which Hera was said to have renewed her virginity every year.

===Byzantine and Frankish rule===

The Acronauplia has walls dating from pre-classical times. Subsequently, Byzantines, Franks, Venetians, and Turks added to the fortifications. In the Middle Ages, Nauplia was called τὸ Ναύπλιον, τὸ Ἀνάπλιον, or τὰ Ἀνάπλια. It became a place of considerable importance, and has continued so down to the present day. In the time of the Crusades it first emerges from obscurity. Nafplio was taken in 1212 by French Crusaders of the Principality of Achaea. It became part of the lordship of Argos and Nauplia, which in 1388 was sold to the Republic of Venice, who regarded it as one of their most important places in the Levant. During the subsequent 150 years, the lower city was expanded and fortified, and new fortifications added to Acronauplia.

===Venetian and Ottoman rule===

The city, under Venetian rule twice repelled Ottoman attacks and sieges, first by Mehmed the Conqueror during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479) and then by Suleiman the Magnificent. The city surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540, who renamed it Mora Yenişehri and established it as the seat of a sanjak. At that period, Nafplio looked very much like the 16th century image shown below to the right.

The Venetians retook Nafplio in 1685 and made it the capital of their &quot;Kingdom of the Morea&quot;. The city was strengthened by building the castle of Palamidi, which was in fact the last major construction of the Venetian empire overseas. However, only 80 soldiers were assigned to defend the city and it was easily retaken by the Ottomans in 1715. Palamidi is located on a hill north of the old town. During the Greek War of Independence, it played a major role. It was captured by forces of Staikopoulos and Kolokotronis in November 1822.

===19th century: Independence and first capital===
During the Greek War of Independence, Nafplio was a major Ottoman stronghold and was besieged for more than a year. The town finally surrendered on account of forced starvation. After its capture, because of its strong fortifications, it became the seat of the provisional government of Greece.

Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, first head of state of newly liberated Greece, set foot on the Greek mainland for the first time in Nafplio on 7 January 1828 and made it the official capital of Greece in 1829. He was assassinated on 9 October 1831 by members of the Mavromichalis family, on the steps of the church of Saint Spyridon in Nafplio. After his assassination, a period of anarchy followed, until the arrival of King Otto and the establishment of the new Kingdom of Greece. Nafplio remained the capital of the kingdom until 1834, when King Otto decided to move the capital to Athens.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Tourism emerged as an important economic activity following the Greek Civil War, and Nafplio became one of the first areas to develop mass tourism in the mainland. Nowadays it is one of the most popular destinations in Greece and attracts a large variety of tourists, with the most coming from Athens and other cities in Greece, followed by many tourists from Germany, France, Scandinavia, Russia, the Balkans and the United States. Due to its architectural legacy, its proximity to the capital, Athens, and its mild and pleasant climate it attracts visitors all-year round, and it is the most popular destination for weekend or one-day excursions.

Apart from tourism agriculture is a very important sector and the city is also surrounded by a fertile irrigated plain and produces oranges, lemons, peaches, apricots, olives and almonds. The Port of Nafplio is used only for bulk cargo due to its insufficient depth and also hosts a great number of leisure ships during the tourist season. The city has not developed any industrial activity of note and all secondary activities are related to agriculture or the construction industry.

==Transportation==
===Bus===
Since 1952, the town has been served by public bus (KTEL Argolida), which provides daily services to all destinations in region as well as other major Greek centers such as Athens. The journey to Athens takes two to two hours and 20 minutes, going via Corinth/Isthmos and Argos.

===Train===
Rail service began in 1886 using an earlier station that still stands.

The town is connected by a branch line of ten kilometers from Argos to Nafplio. In 2011, the Corinth–Argos–Nafplio train service was suspended during the Greek financial crisis. The Region of the Peloponnese is currently trying to secure funding to restore railway services and modernize the line.

== Architecture ==


Acronauplia is the oldest part of the city though a modern hotel has been built on it. Until the thirteenth century, it was a town on its own. The arrival of the Venetians and the Franks transformed it into part of the town fortifications. Other fortifications of the city include the Palamidi and Bourtzi, which is located in the middle of the harbour.

Nafplio maintains its own distinct traditional architectural style with many colourful buildings around the old town, influenced by the Venetians, due to their domination between 1338–1540 and during the Kingdom of the Morea and to a much lower degree by the Ottomans. Furthermore the city also contains a great number of eclecticist and neoclassical buildings and even a smaller number of modernist buildings such as Hotel Amphitryon (designed in the 1950s by architect Kleon Krantonellis). The city also contains the only example of Mycenaean Revival architecture, the National Bank of Greece branch of Nafplio.

It is one of the few Greek cities to have been spared the widespread destruction of traditional architecture during the process of &quot;antiparochí&quot;, due to the efforts of the archaeologist Evangelia Protonotariou Deilaki, whose actions went against the prevailing trend of the post-war era.

Around the city can be found several sculptures and statues. They are related mostly with the modern history of Nafplio, such as the statues of Ioannis Kapodistrias, Otto of Greece and Theodoros Kolokotronis.

<text>The 1968 Winter Olympics, officially known as the X Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Grenoble, France, from 6 to 18 February 1968. A total of 1,158 athletes representing 37 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, including first-time entrants Morocco. The games featured 35 events in 6 sports and 10 disciplines. The team relay event in biathlon was contested for the first time.

Fifteen NOCs won at least one medal, and thirteen of them secured at least one gold. East and West Germany entered separate teams for the first time, ending a run of three straight editions (1956–1964) in which German athletes participated as a single team. Victories by Thomas Köhler and Klaus-Michael Bonsack (luge doubles), and by Franz Keller (Nordic combined), resulted in the first Winter Olympics gold medals for East and West Germany, respectively.
Czechoslovakia also got its first-ever gold at the Winter Games, thanks to a successful combination of ski jumps by Jiří Raška in the normal hill (70 m) event. In Grenoble, Romania won its first medal at the Winter Games, as Ion Panţuru and Nicolae Neagoe secured the bronze in bobsleigh&#x27;s two-man event.

Among individual participants, French alpine skier Jean-Claude Killy had the most gold medals with three, having swept men&#x27;s alpine skiing events.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In speed skating, two-way ties for the second place in the men&#x27;s 500 m and men&#x27;s 1,500 m events, as well as a three-way tie in the women&#x27;s 500 m event, resulted in the awarding of an additional four silver medals; as a consequence, three bronzes were not presented.

<text>The California State Railroad Museum is a museum in the California State Parks system that interprets the role of railroads in the Western U.S.. It is located in Old Sacramento State Historic Park at 111 I Street, Sacramento, California.

==Features==
The museum features 21 restored locomotives and railroad cars, some dating back to 1862. The &quot;Sierra Scene&quot; shows a large scale mockup of a construction scene high in the Sierra Nevada representing Donner Pass , featuring the locomotive &quot;Gov. Stanford&quot;. Other exhibits show how the influence of railroads changed American society, influencing travel, commerce and daily life, as well as the lives of railroaders and the diversity of people who work on railroads. Changing exhibits featuring photography, ephemera, and artifacts from the museum&#x27;s collection, add depth and incidental information to the overall story of railroad history. The museum has an extensive educational program for elementary students from across the region to help them learn about railroad history using re-enactments, costumed docents, and including train and handcar rides. The roundhouse area of the museum features a rotating display of locomotives and equipment belonging to the museum. When not on display, these items are stored and worked on at the nearby Sacramento Railyards in the remaining buildings that were part of the original Southern Pacific Shop complex. A large 3-rail O scale model train layout is also located in the museum.

Adjacent to the main museum building is a reconstruction of the 1870s-era Central Pacific Railroad passenger station and freight depot on Front Street, which houses historic and contemporary railroad equipment. In early 2011, the interior remained closed to public use, but is occasionally open for special events. Between April and October, the Sacramento Southern Railroad, operated by the museum, takes passengers on a 40-minute, roundtrip route along the Sacramento River on a portion of the Walnut Grove branch of the former Southern Pacific Railroad. The Sacramento Southern Railroad owns the Walnut Grove Branch right-of-way that extends south from Sacramento along the eastern bank of the Sacramento River. Past plans for the excursion ride included expansion on its former right of way to Hood, CA, but were scrapped in favor of a mixed-use paved recreational trail known as the Del Rio Trail project.

In 1992, Railtown 1897 in Jamestown began operating under the museum.

In recent years the museum has begun expanding their digital resources. Of note, the museum has several digital exhibits and a museum podcast &quot;Roundhouse Crosstalk.&quot;

==Library and archives==
In addition to the rolling stock and exhibits on display, the California State Railroad Museum collects material relating to railroading in the West. The museum&#x27;s library and archives contain:
* Books: The museum&#x27;s library holds hundreds of books ranging from the modern era to the early days of railroading in the United States. Prominent authors in the library&#x27;s collections include Lucius Beebe, and Charles Clegg. Topics in these books range from technical specifications, railroad culture, various regional railroad histories, and corporate histories of railroads.
* Technical drawings: These drawings consist mainly locomotives, equipment, structures, maps and track layouts of railroads in the western part of the United States. A significant part of this collection comes from the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, and the Lima Locomotive Works.
* Railroad Photography: The Museum&#x27;s photo collection is extensive, covering hundreds of different railroads across the West. These railroads include but are not limited to the Southern Pacific Railroad, Western Pacific Railroad, Denver and Rio Grande Western, and Santa Fe Railroad.
* Railroad ephemera: such as informational pamphlets and promotional materials for railroad companies.
* Artifacts: examples include signs, pins, and large physical objects relating to working or being involved in the railroad.
* Archival Collections: The museum&#x27;s archival collections contain materials donated to the archive from railroad employees, railroad companies, railfan groups, and others from across the United States.

==History==
The museum has its origins in 1937, when a group of railroad enthusiasts in the San Francisco Bay Area formed the Pacific Coast Chapter of the Railway &amp; Locomotive Historical Society. This organization worked for years to promote the idea of a railroad museum, donating 30 historic locomotives and cars to the California Department of Parks and Recreation to be the nucleus of a State-operated museum in Sacramento. The museum&#x27;s first facility, the Central Pacific Railroad Passenger Station, opened in 1976. The Railroad History Museum was completed in 1981. Steam-powered passenger train service on the Sacramento Southern Railroad began in 1984, with the Central Pacific Railroad Freight Depot opening three years later. Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown was added to the museum complex during 1992. The museum became a Smithsonian affiliate in June 2017.

<text>Bacterial pneumonia is a type of pneumonia caused by bacterial infection.

==Types==

===Gram-positive===
&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; () is the most common bacterial cause of pneumonia in all age groups except newborn infants. &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; is a Gram-positive bacterium that often lives in the throat of people who do not have pneumonia.

Other important Gram-positive causes of pneumonia are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; () and &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;.

===Gram-negative===
Gram-negative bacteria are seen less frequently: &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (), &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; (), &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (), &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; (), &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, and &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot; are the most common.

These bacteria often live in the gut and enter the lungs when contents of the gut (such as vomit or faeces) are inhaled.

Pneumonia caused by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; is usually called pneumonic plague.

===Atypical===
Atypical bacteria causing pneumonia are &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot; (), &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; (), and &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;.

The term &quot;atypical&quot; does not relate to how commonly these organisms cause pneumonia, how well it responds to common antibiotics or how typical the symptoms are; it refers instead to the fact that these organisms have atypical or absent cell wall structures and do not take up Gram stain in the same manner as gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Pneumonia
* Fever
* Rigors
* Cough
* Runny nose (either direct bacterial pneumonia or accompanied by primary viral pneumonia)
* Dyspnea – shortness of breath
* Chest pain
* Shaking chills
* Pneumococcal pneumonia can cause coughing up of blood, or hemoptysis, characteristically associated with &quot;rusty&quot; sputum
* Night Sweats

== Pathophysiology ==
Bacteria typically enter the lung with inhalation, though they can reach the lung through the bloodstream if other parts of the body are infected. Often, bacteria live in parts of the upper respiratory tract and are continuously being inhaled into the alveoli, the cavities deep in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. Once inside the alveoli, bacteria travel into the spaces between the cells and also between adjacent alveoli through connecting pores. This invasion triggers the immune system to respond by sending white blood cells responsible for attacking microorganisms (neutrophils) to the lungs. The neutrophils engulf and kill the offending organisms but also release cytokines that result in a general activation of the immune system. This results in the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial and fungal pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid leaked from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli and result in impaired oxygen transportation.

Bacteria can travel from the lung into the blood stream (bacteremia) and can result in serious illness such as sepsis and eventually septic shock, in which there is low blood pressure leading to damage in multiple parts of the body including the brain, kidney, and heart. They can also travel to the area between the lungs and the chest wall, called the pleural cavity.

In some very rare cases, bacterial pneumonia can form from someone throwing up and then falling asleep on their side causing some stomach fluid to funnel into the lungs leading to this infection.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is carried out in steps. 

Patient history is obtained, including the symptoms and their duration, as well as exposure to any risk factors of the disease. A chest X-ray may be performed to check for signs of inflammation and a complete blood count will also be obtained. A sputum sample will also be obtained to ascertain the causative bacteria. This also plays a role in informing treatment options.

In some cases, pulse oximetry may also be required as pneumonia is known to deplete oxygen levels in the blood. Other vitals such as pulse and body temperature are also checked.

Depending on the general health, severity of the disease and age of the patient, several other tests may be required, such as:

* Blood culture
* Thoracocentesis
* A CT scan
* Bronchoscopy
* Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

==Prevention==
Prevention of bacterial pneumonia is by vaccination against &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine for adults and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for children), &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type B, meningococcus, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, and &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;.

== Treatment ==
Antibiotics are the treatment of choice for bacterial pneumonia, with ventilation (oxygen supplement) as supportive therapy. The antibiotic choice depends on the nature of the pneumonia, the microorganisms most commonly causing pneumonia in the geographical region, and the immune status and underlying health of the individual. In the United Kingdom, amoxicillin is used as first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients acquiring pneumonia in the community, sometimes with added clarithromycin. In North America, where the &quot;atypical&quot; forms of community-acquired pneumonia are becoming more common, clarithromycin, azithromycin, or fluoroquinolones as single therapy have displaced the amoxicillin as first-line therapy.
Local patterns of antibiotic resistance always need to be considered when initiating pharmacotherapy. Another common antibiotic used is called zithromax, this treats many other bacterial infections. In hospitalized individuals or those with immune deficiencies, local guidelines determine the selection of antibiotics. 
===Gram-positive organisms===
&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; — amoxicillin (or erythromycin in patients allergic to penicillin); cefuroxime and erythromycin in severe cases.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; — flucloxacillin (to counteract the organism&#x27;s β-lactamase).

===Gram-negative organisms===
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; — doxycycline; second generation cephalosporins such as cefaclor
* &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;
* &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; — ciprofloxacin
* &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;

===Atypical organisms===
* &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot; — doxycycline
* &quot;Chlamydophila psittaci&quot; — erythromycin
* &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; — erythromycin
* &quot;Coxiella burnetti&quot; — doxycycline
* &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot; — erythromycin, with rifampicin sometimes added.

People who have difficulty breathing due to pneumonia may require extra oxygen. An extremely sick individual may require artificial ventilation and intensive care as life-saving measures while his or her immune system fights off the infectious cause with the help of antibiotics and other drugs.

<text>The NASA Space Flight Medal is a decoration of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. According to its statutes, it is awarded &quot;for significant achievement or service during individual participation as a civilian or military astronaut, pilot, mission specialist, payload specialist, or other space flight participant in a space flight mission.&quot; In practice, the medal is bestowed upon any astronaut (US or foreign) who flies aboard a United States space mission, and typically every subsequent flight is honored with an additional award.

Multiple awards of the decoration are annotated either by award stars or oak leaf clusters (depending on the civilian or military status of the recipient and, if military, the branch of service). The NASA Space Flight Medal is also authorized for wear on active uniforms of the United States military and is worn after all military decorations.

For those who perform an act of gallantry or heroic action while engaged in a U.S. space mission, NASA also presents an award known as the Congressional Space Medal of Honor. This is separate award from the Medal of Honor which is a U.S. military decoration for extreme bravery.

<doc id="966922" wikidata="Q186691" url="?curid=966922" title="Oleg Blokhin">
<text>Oleg Vladimirovich Blokhin, or Oleh Volodymyrovych Blokhin (, ; born 5 November 1952), is a Ukrainian and Soviet former football player and manager. Regarded as one of the greatest footballers of his generation, Blokhin was a standout striker for Dynamo Kyiv and the Soviet Union.

He holds the all-time top goalscorer record for both Dynamo Kiev (266 goals) and the Soviet Union national team (42 goals), as well as being the overall top goalscorer in the history of the Soviet Top League (211 goals). He is also the only player to have been capped over 100 times for the Soviet Union and holds Dynamo&#x27;s appearance record with 582 appearances during his 18-year spell at the club. With Dynamo, Blokhin won eight Soviet league titles, five national cups and two European Cup Winners&#x27; Cups. He also competed for the Soviet Union at the 1972 and 1976 Olympic Games and 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups. During his playing career he won the Soviet Footballer of the Year award three times and the Ukrainian Footballer of the Year award nine times (both records). In 1975, he was named European Footballer of the Year, winning the Ballon d&#x27;Or, becoming the second Soviet and the first Ukrainian player to achieve such a feat.

As a coach, he has had two spells in charge of the Ukraine national team, managing the team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012.

In 2011, Blokhin, together with Igor Belanov and Vitaliy Starukhin were named as &quot;the legends of Ukrainian football&quot; at the Victory of Football awards.

== Early life ==
Blokhin was born in Kyiv, the capital of the Ukrainian SSR, in 1952. His mother Kateryna Adamenko was multiple champion of USSR in the pentathlon, sprint and long jump. He was born to a Russian father and Ukrainian mother. His father Vladimir Blokhin was a police officer, a World War II veteran, and a competitive sprinter. Owing to his parents, Blokhin quickly mastered sprint, and by the age of 16 ran 60 m in less than 7 seconds, and 100 m in 11.0 seconds.

== Playing career ==
Blokhin was one of the greatest players in the world throughout the 1970s, hitting the target regularly through a period of great success at his hometown club Dynamo Kyiv and becoming the greatest goalscorer in the history of the Soviet League, which was one of Europe&#x27;s strongest. Normally a forward or winger, Blokhin was most renowned for possessing exceptional pace.

Blokhin played during most of his career for Dynamo Kyiv, becoming the USSR national championship&#x27;s all-time leader and goalscorer with 211 goals, as well as making more appearances than any other player with 432 appearances. He won the championship 8 times. He led Dynamo to the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1975 and 1986, scoring a goal in each final. Blokhin is also the USSR national football team&#x27;s most capped player with 112 caps, as well as their all-time leading goalscorer with 42 goals; he played in the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups where he scored one goal in each. He was one of the first Soviet players to play abroad, signing for Austria&#x27;s Vorwärts Steyr in 1988, he also played in Cyprus with Aris.

In 1979 Blokhin played a couple of games for Ukraine at the Spartakiad of the Peoples of the USSR.

== Coaching career ==
After retiring as a player, Blokhin coached Greek clubs Olympiacos (Under him they won the Greek Cup and the Greek Super Cup in 1992), PAOK, AEK Athens, and Ionikos.

He began serving as the head coach of the Ukraine national team in September 2003. Under his leadership, Ukraine qualified for a major tournament for the first time as an independent nation, reaching the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Ukraine reached the quarter-finals of the tournament, losing to eventual champions Italy. Following the side&#x27;s failure to reach UEFA Euro 2008, Blokhin stepped down as coach on 6 December 2007.

On 14 December 2007, he was named head coach of FC Moscow. The club finished 9th (from 16) and after the season ended Blokhin was fired from the club. At the end of the season, Blokhin announced that if he knew how things would go in FC Moscow, he would have never signed there. This was because the club released many important players without Blokhin&#x27;s permission yet still had many high expectations. Others said that the reason Blokhin failed in FC Moscow was that he and the press didn&#x27;t have a friendly relationship, and because of that the press was constantly attacking Blokhin and that damaged his status among the players.

On 21 April 2011, Blokhin was again appointed head coach of the Ukraine national team. He led the team in UEFA Euro 2012 on home soil, beating Sweden but exiting at the group stage after defeats to France and England.

On 25 September 2012, Dynamo Kyiv signed Blokhin to lead the club for the next four years. His final matches in charge of Ukraine were World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Montenegro in October 2012. Blokhin was dismissed as Dynamo&#x27;s manager by the club&#x27;s President Ihor Surkis on 17 April 2014 because of the &quot;unsatisfactory results of the team&quot;. The day before, in a press conference after Dynamo had lost a match against Shakhtar Donetsk, Blokhin had already stated that he had decided to resign. Under his leadership Dynamo never qualified (a rare occasion for the club) for the UEFA Champions League and performed poorly in the UEFA Europa League. In his first year his team finished third in the Ukrainian Premier League and in his second year (when he was fired) Dynamo was seven points behind Ukrainian Premier League leaders Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk and Shakhtar Donetsk.

== Politics ==
In 1998 Blokhin was elected to Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine&#x27;s parliament) for Hromada. He joined Hromada while still being a member of the Communist Party of Ukraine. In 2002, Blokhin was elected to Verkhovna Rada for a second term. In October 2002, he joined the United Social Democratic Party of Ukraine.

== Family ==
Blokhin&#x27;s father, Volodymyr Blokhin, is a native of Moscow, a veteran of the World War II, survivor of the Leningrad blockade, and a former Soviet law enforcement agent. He later worked as a sports functionary for the Soviet Dynamo Society. Blokhin&#x27;s mother Kateryna Adamenko is from Nebrat village in Borodianka Raion, Kyiv Oblast. She originally worked at a Kyiv sewing factory, but eventually discovered hidden athletic talents and became the Soviet champion in track and field as well as pentathlon. After retiring from sports, she became a staff member at one of Kyiv&#x27;s universities.

Blokhin was married to Irina Deriugina, a top coach and former world champion in rhythmic gymnastics, but the couple divorced in the early 1990s. Blokhin and Deriugina have a daughter, singer Iryna Blokhina, who wrote and performed the Euro 2012 anthem.

Blokhin and his second wife, Angela, have two daughters, Hanna (born 2001) and Katerina (born 2002).

<text>CSKA Moscow () is a Russian sports club based in Moscow. It was created in 1911 in the Russian Empire on base of OLLS (Skiing Society, founded 1901). Later, during the Soviet era, it was the central part of the Armed Forces sports society, which in turn was associated with the Soviet Army; because of this, it was popularly referred to in the West as &quot;Red Army&quot; or &quot;the Red Army team&quot;. The historical CSKA sport club (a.k.a. &quot;Big CSKA&quot;) is still a department of the Russian Defense Ministry.

Following the 2023 publication of the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s criteria for the reinstatement of Russian athletes (they were suspended in February 2022 due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine), athletes affiliated with CSKA Moscow were officially prohibited from attending the Olympic Games until at least 2026.

==Composition==
The &quot;Big CSKA&quot; had several teams in many sports, but those which are still operating are all now private clubs:

The CSKA has also been home to many figure skaters, including Adelina Sotnikova, Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov. Elena Mukhina, the 1978 World Champion artistic gymnast, Aliya Mustafina and Yevgeniya Kanayeva, Olympic gold medalists in gymnastics, Sofya Velikaya, a sabre fencer, Olympic champions Elena Vesnina, and Viktor An.

==Brief overview==
The club was created as the &quot;Experimentally demonstrative Military Sports field of Vsevobuch&quot; (OPPV) in February 1923 by the Central Administration of Military Training for workers based on the pre-revolutionary &quot;Society of Ski Sports Amateurs&quot; (OLLS). The field was located at the Sokolniki Park in Moscow. On April 29, 1923, the football team of the club has played its first game in the Moscow city championship. In February 1928 the club was included to the newly established the Frunze Central House of Red Army (CDKA) as a department of physical culture and sports. In October 1953 all sports centers of CDKA and Air Force of the Moscow Military District were included in the Central Sports Club of Ministry of Defense (CSK MO), which in April 1960 it was renamed into its more common title - the Central Sports Club of the Armed Forces (CSKA), which the Moscow branch belonged as the flagship and most elite of all the clubs within the Soviet Armed Forces.

The club is active in more than 40 sports, and produced 463 Olympic champions for the Soviet Union and Russia, 11,000 champions in local Soviet and Russian championships, and 2629 golden medalists in European and world championships.

In 1973 the CSKA sports society was awarded the Order of Lenin.

<doc id="966943" wikidata="Q437409" url="?curid=966943" title="List of Family Guy episodes">
<text>&quot;Family Guy&quot; is an American adult animated television sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the dysfunctional Griffin family, which consists of father Peter (MacFarlane), mother Lois (Alex Borstein), daughter Meg (Lacey Chabert in Episodes 1–9, then Mila Kunis from Episode 10 onwards), son Chris (Seth Green), baby Stewie (MacFarlane), and Brian (MacFarlane), the family dog. The show is set in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island, and lampoons American culture in the form of cutaway gags, science fiction, and tangential vignettes.

The concept of &quot;Family Guy&quot; was conceived by MacFarlane in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design. He created two shorts entitled &quot;The Life of Larry&quot; and &quot;Larry &amp; Steve&quot;, both of which played a key role in Fox executives&#x27; decision to pick up the series in 1998. After two seasons, Fox decided to cancel the show. Despite the cancellation, a third season was produced, after which the series was officially cancelled at the end of the 2001–2002 season. Reruns on Cartoon Network&#x27;s block Adult Swim drove up interest, and a letter-writing campaign, along with impressive DVD sales, encouraged Fox to bring the show back for the 2005–2006 television season.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; and its cast have been nominated for twenty-seven Primetime Emmy Awards, winning eight. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie, MacFarlane and Walter Murphy won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song &quot;You Got a Lot to See&quot; from the episode &quot;Brian Wallows and Peter&#x27;s Swallows&quot;, Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode &quot;No Chris Left Behind&quot;, Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode &quot;Road to the Multiverse&quot;, Patrick S. Clark and Jim Fitzpatrick won the Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation award for their sound mixing work on the episode &quot;Road to the North Pole&quot;, and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance award for his performances in the episode &quot;Pilling Them Softly&quot;. The show was nominated for twelve Annies, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since &quot;The Flintstones&quot; in 1961.

 The series remains Fox&#x27;s second-longest-running program, behind &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It also remains the fourth-longest-running scripted primetime series in North America. Season 23 premiered on October 14, 2024.

<text>The RWD 5 was a Polish touring and sports plane of 1931, a two-seat high-wing monoplane, constructed by the RWD team. It was made famous by its transatlantic flight, being the smallest aircraft to cross the Atlantic.

==Development==
The RWD 5 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanisław Rogalski, Stanisław Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki (their designs were named RWD after their initial letters). It was a further development of earlier RWD aircraft series (RWD 1, RWD 2, RWD 3 and RWD 7), especially of its direct predecessor, the RWD 4. It shared the same wing shape and construction, while the fuselage was totally new, constructed of steel frame, unlike its wooden predecessors. The fuselage had a modern shape and a closed canopy with panoramic windows (earlier models had atypical fish-shaped fuselages with no direct forward view from the pilot&#x27;s seat).

The first prototype (registration SP-AGJ) was flown on 7 August 1931 by its designer Jerzy Drzewiecki. It was built in new workshops of Warsaw University of Technology near Okęcie airport, from 1933 converted to &quot;Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze&quot; (DWL) company.

After successes of the prototype in air competitions, a small-scale series production was set up, mostly for the Polish Aero Club. Series aircraft had improved landing gear. Two were built in 1932 (registration SP-AJA and AJB), five in 1933 (including the single-seater RWD 5bis), eleven in 1934 (including one in Aero Club workshops in Lublin) and one more in 1937 (SP-BGX), for a total of 20 aircraft. In 1932, the RWD 5 was shown at the International Air Show in Paris.

==Service==

RWD 5s were mostly used as trainers and sport planes by Polish regional aero clubs. They scored good results in local competitions, starting from 1931, when the prototype won the 3rd South-Western Poland Flight (pilot M. Pronaszko) and the 4th Domestic Touring Aircraft Contest (pilot Franciszek Żwirko). As sport and touring planes, they were later superseded by the RWD 13, and were relegated mostly for training. Three were written off before 1939.

One aircraft was used by LOT Polish Airlines in 1933–1936 for taxi flights (registration SP-LOT), one by LOPP organization (SP-LOP). After the outbreak of World War II, during the Polish September Campaign, at least three RWD 5 were utilized as liaison aircraft by the Polish Air Force (SP-ALR, ALX, ALZ). Also, Maj. E. Wyrwicki flew RWD 5 from Romania to besieged Warsaw (according to other sources, he flew RWD-5 SP-AJB from Warsaw). None of the RWD 5s survived the war.

One RWD 5 was sold to Brazil in 1938 (former SP-LO, removed from the Polish registry on 4 December 1936) and registered there as PP-TDX in 1939. Its airworthiness expired in 1943.

In late 1990s, a flying replica of the RWD 5, named RWD 5R, was built in Poland by EEA991 association. It flew first on 26 August 2000, and is powered with 140 hp LOM Praha Avia M-332 engine (registration SP-LOT).

==The flight across the Atlantic==
In March 1933 a special single-seater variant was built, called RWD 5bis (registration SP-AJU), powered with 130 hp Gipsy Major engine. The rear cabin was replaced with an additional 300 L (79 US gal) fuel tank, and the windows were removed. Additional fuel tanks were added in wings, the fuel capacity reached 752 L (199 US gal) in total and a range increased to . Stanisław Skarżyński flew this plane from Warsaw to Rio de Janeiro from 27 April to 24 June 1933, on a path of .

During his travel, on 7 May/8 May, Skarżynski flew the RWD 5bis across the southern Atlantic, from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Maceio in Brazil. The flight took 20 hours 30 minutes (17 hours above the ocean). He crossed , establishing a distance record in the FAI light tourist plane class. The RWD 5bis was at that time the smallest plane that has ever flown across the Atlantic — its empty weight was below 450 kg (1000 lb), loaded 1100 kg (2425 lb). The plane had no radio nor safety equipment, due to weight. It returned to Europe on a ship. After its record-breaking flight, the RWD 5bis was converted to a two-seater variant without additional tanks, and used by Skarżyński. The SP-AJU was seized by the Soviets in Lwów in September 1939, after their invasion on Poland.

==Description==
Mixed construction (steel and wood) high-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout. The fuselage of a steel frame, covered with canvas on a wooden frame (with duralumin in engine section). Trapezoid one-part wing, canvas covered (plywood in front), two-spar, with no mechanization. A crew of two, sitting in tandem in a glazed cockpit, with dual controls and individual doors on the right. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid, wheels in teardrop covers on serial aircraft.

Engine in front, with tractor two-blade wooden propeller of a fixed pitch. A variety of 4-cylinder air-cooled inverted straight engines were used, most typically Cirrus Hermes IIB (105 hp (78 kW) nominal power and 115 hp (86 kW) take-off power). Used also were 130 hp Hermes IV or de Havilland Gipsy III, or 120 hp Walter Junior 4. The RWD 5bis and RWD 5 SP-LOT had a 130 hp (97 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major.

<doc id="966951" wikidata="Q600376" url="?curid=966951" title="1964 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1964 Winter Olympics, officially known as the IX Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in Innsbruck, Austria, from 29 January to 9 February. A total of 1,091 athletes representing 36 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, including India, Mongolia, and North Korea, who took part in the Winter Games for the first time. The games featured 34 events in 6 sports across 10 disciplines, including the Olympic debut of Luge.

Athletes representing 14 NOCs received at least one medal, with 11 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. Athletes from the Soviet Union won the most gold medals, with 11, and most overall medals, with 25. The Netherlands won their first gold medal at the Winter Games, doing so in the women’s figure skating individual event, while North Korea won their first medal of any kind, taking silver in women&#x27;s 3,000 metres speed skating. Soviet speed skater Lidiya Skoblikova won four gold medals which was both the most gold and overall medals among individual participants.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

At the 1964 Winter Olympics, athletes were tied in three events. In the women&#x27;s 3000 metres speed skating and women&#x27;s giant slalom events there were two-way ties for second, which resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medals being awarded in each event. In the men&#x27;s 500 metres speed skating event there was a three-way tie for second, which resulted in three silver medals and no bronze medal being awarded.

<text>The EZ-Link card is a rechargeable contactless smart card and electronic money system that is primarily used as a payment method for public transport such as bus and rail lines in Singapore. A standard EZ-Link card is a credit-card-sized stored-value contact-less smart-card that comes in a variety of colours, as well as limited edition designs. It is sold by SimplyGo Pte Ltd, a merged entity of TransitLink and EZ-Link since 2024, a subsidiary of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), and can be used on travel modes across Singapore, including the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), the Light Rail Transit (LRT), public buses which are operated by SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Tower Transit Singapore and Go-Ahead Singapore, as well as the Sentosa Express.

Established in 2001, the first generation of the card was based on the Sony FeliCa smart card technology and was promoted as the means for speedier boarding times on the city-state&#x27;s bus and rail services. It had a monopoly on public transportation fare payments in Singapore until September 2009, when the NETS FlashPay card, which had a monopoly over Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) toll payments, entered the market for transportation payments (and vice versa). EZ-Link cards are distributed and managed by EZ-Link Pte. Ltd., also a subsidiary of Singapore&#x27;s Land Transport Authority.

In September 2009, CEPAS EZ-Link cards replaced the original EZ-Link card, expanding the card&#x27;s usage to taxis, ERP gantries (with the dual-mode in-vehicle unit), car parks (which have been upgraded to accept CEPAS-compliant cards), convenience stores, supermarkets and fast food restaurants. Compared to NETS FlashPay however, EZ-Link has lesser acceptance at retail shops. EZ-Link can also be used as a payment card at vending machines throughout the country.

Account-based CEPAS EZ-Link card was launched in January 2021.

In March 2023, the Land Transport Authority announced plans to merge their subsidiaries TransitLink and EZ-Link into a single entity SimplyGo.

==History==
===Development===
The Land Transport Authority introduced its pilot testing of the card to 100,000 volunteers on 26 February 2000. Initially for commuters who made at least five trips on MRT/LRT per week, the card was branded as the &quot;Super Rider&quot;. As an incentive, volunteers were given 10% rebate off their regular fare during the one-month period. Two further tests were made, with the scheme extending to frequent bus users on selected routes on an invitation basis.

==Card usage==
The card is commonly used in Singapore as a smartcard for paying transportation fees in the city-state&#x27;s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Light Rail Transit (LRT) and public bus services. The EZ-Link function is also used in concession cards for students in nationally recognised educational institutes, full-time national service personnel serving in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Civil Defence Force and Singapore Police Force or senior citizens who are over 60 years old.

The system is similar to the Pasmo and ICOCA cards, and the card&#x27;s use have since been expanded to retail, private transport, government services, community services, educational institutes and vending machines.

On 17 October 2007, local telco StarHub and EZ-Link Pte Ltd declared the start of a 6-month trial on phones with an embedded EZ-Link card.

Since 2009, Singapore motorists can use EZ-Link cards in their new generation In-Vehicle Unit to pay for Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) and Electronic Parking System (EPS) payments. In August 2016, EZ-Link introduced a post-paid ERP payment service called EZ-Pay.

In March 2016, EZ-Link concluded a trial with the Land Transport Authority and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore on the use of compatible mobile phones with Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology to make public transport payments.

In February 2018, EZ-Link and NTUC Social Enterprises launched a partnership to promote cashless payments. This allowed EZ-Link card holders with a linked NTUC Plus card to earn LinkPoints with EZ-Link purchases, spare change could also be used to top-up EZ-Link cards when customers make cash payments at Cheers convenience stores, and EZ-Link acceptance was extended to NTUC FairPrice supermarkets and NTUC Unity pharmacies. However, EZ-Link payments at FairPrice and Unity stores were ceased on 3 May 2023 until further notice. On 12 June 2024, EZ-Link acceptance is reenabled at Fairprice, with a slow rollout over a small number of outlets initially.

In April 2018, the card also gained acceptance on NETS terminals in hawker centres across Singapore.

In September 2018, the EZ-Link card became part of a unified cashless payment system rolled out at 500 hawker stalls across Singapore.

In April 2019, EZ-Link announced it was working with Touch &#x27;N Go to create a dual currency cross-border card for public transport. The card was launched on 17 August 2020.

==Variations==
In 2007, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Singapore Tourism Board launched the Singapore Tourist Pass produced by EZ-Link to offer tourists unlimited rides on Singapore&#x27;s public transport system.

In 2015, EZ-Link introduced &#x27;EZ-Charms&#x27;, trinkets that have full EZ-Link functionalities, such as the Hello Kitty EZ-Charms, that received overwhelming response.

In 2017, EZ-Link launched EZ-Link Wearables, wearable devices that have full EZ-Link functionalities such as fitness trackers.

===System for e-Payments (SeP)===
A trial to test the system was held from 29 August to 28 October 2008. The trial, which involved some 5,000 commuters, generated 1.7 million transactions and has confirmed that the system is ready for revenue service. Developed in-house by the LTA, SeP is built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) which allows any smart card that complies with the standard to be used with the system and in a wide variety of payment applications.

With SeP, commuters were able to use cards issued by any card issuer for transit purposes as long as the card complied with the CEPAS standard and included the transit application. Commuters could eventually use CEPAS-compliant cards for Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) payments in vehicles fitted with the new generation In-vehicle Unit (IU), Electronic Parking System (EPS) carparks and other electronic payment systems that supported the CEPAS standard.

During the free one-for-one exchange exercise, most of them replaced their cards during the direct card replacement exercise in 2009. Others seemed to replace new cards after the old cards were out of value and become collectors&#x27; value. The new EZ-Link cards also have a higher storage capacity of S$500.00 instead of the previous S$100.00 limit but most passengers keep to the $100 limit in case of loss of card.

===EZ-Link App===
The EZ-Link App is a mobile application developed by EZ-Link that is available on the Google Play Store and App Store. It was first released as an Android-exclusive app in 2013 under the name &#x27;My EZ-Link Mobile App&#x27;, and is used for:

* Topping up of EZ-Link cards and Concession Cards using NFC-enabled Android phones and with debit cards, credit cards and PayLah! as payment options.
* Registering for EZ-Reload, an auto top -up service with Mastercard or Visa credit card. In August 2018, EZ-Link moved the application for EZ-Reload from web-based forms to the EZ-Link app, shortening the approval process to minutes.
* Earning of points when paying with EZ-Link to redeem rewards. From February 2018, EZ-Link card users can get one LinkPoint by NTUC Link for every S$2 spent using EZ-Link at retail stalls.
* Registering for EZ-Pay, a post-paid card-less service for ERP and EPS payments launched in 2016 that removes the hassle of topping up CashCard for motorists in Singapore.
* On-the-go checking of transactions and balance of EZ-Link.
* Blocking of EZ-Link when misplaced and recovering of remaining value.
* QR code payments with EZ-Link Wallet.

===EZ-Link Wallet===
On 9 March 2020, EZ-Link launched the EZ-Link Wallet, an e-wallet for mobile phones. Compared to the EZ-Link card which is based on NFC, the EZ-Link Wallet is based on QR code, bypassing the need for payment terminals, relying on smartphones and a printed QR code. It is compliant with the SGQR code system.

An email address and local mobile number are required to register for an EZ-Link account. Users have to top-up the e-wallet with a debit/credit card, and make payments by scanning the QR code at a retail shop and entering the payment amount. Payment can be authorised with either a 6-digit PIN or the phone&#x27;s fingerprint scanner. Up to 6 debit/credit cards can be saved in the EZ-Link app.

Users can earn EZ-Link Rewards points for each digital wallet transaction, which can be used to redeem vouchers. The EZ-Link Wallet can also be used overseas at an Alipay Connect-enabled merchant in Japan.

The following payment networks are supported by the EZ-Link Wallet:
* SGQR: Singapore-based QR code payment, available at selected merchants, hawker centres, coffeeshops.
* Alipay+: A cross-border digital payments solution, interoperable with e-wallets in several Asia countries such as: Alipay+ for Japan, Alipay for China, AlipayHK for Hong Kong, EZ-Link from Singapore, KakaoPay from South Korea, GCash from the Philippines, Touch ‘n Go eWallet from Malaysia, and TrueMoney from Thailand.
* Virtual MasterCard: A one-time identity check via Singpass is required to activate the Mastercard account in the EZ-Link Wallet. Payment modes include: tap to pay via Google Wallet on Android devices with NFC, and online payment at Mastercard merchants globally.

===SimplyGo===

SimplyGo was launched in March 2019 for MasterCard users as a separate account-based ticketing system allowing commuters to pay their public transport fares using bank cards. SimplyGo expanded to Visa on 6 June and Nets on 16 November. When the system launched, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng said that SimplyGo was not intended to replace other payment methods such as EZ-Link. In September 2020, a pilot program to expand the use of SimplyGo with EZ-Link adult cards was launched. This was followed on 28 January 2021 by the rollout of account-based EZ-Link cards for adults. Commuters could also update their existing EZ-Link cards to the new system.

Concession cards were included in SimplyGo on 19 October 2022, with the option to upgrade student concession cards only available in 2023. In March 2023, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that it would merge the TransitLink SimplyGo and EZ-Link mobile apps into a single &quot;SimplyGo&quot; app. On 15 June, the EZ-Link Pte Ltd&#x27;s (EZ-Link) and Transit Link Pte Ltd&#x27;s (TransitLink) transit and travel card-related services were consolidated under the &quot;SimplyGo&quot; branding. On 9 January 2024, LTA announced that EZ-Link cards that had not yet been upgraded to SimplyGo and Nets Flashpay cards would be deprecated on 1 June 2024. By then, a majority of commuters were already using SimplyGo, and the existing card-based system was near the end of its operational lifespan. As it would also be costly to run both ticketing systems, the LTA decided to proceed with SimplyGo.

====Criticism and transitional issues====
Many commuters expressed dissatisfaction with the change, particularly the inability to ascertain the fares charged at the transaction points on buses and the MRT after their cards were upgraded to SimplyGo. When the issue was raised in 2023, the LTA explained that, as most of the SimplyGo features involve back-end processing, riders could not view their stored value card balance and deductions at MRT fare gates and bus readers. The fare transactions could only be viewed on the SimplyGo app. The LTA said that while it would be possible to implement the feature for SimplyGo users, it would take &quot;a few more seconds&quot; for the information from the backend to be displayed at the fare gates, and hence would slow down commuters who were entering or exiting.

During the week after LTA&#x27;s announcement, several commuters attempted to upgrade their EZ-Link cards to the SimplyGo platform. The high transaction volume caused the SimplyGo system to become less stable and responsive, resulting in longer processing times and failed upgrades that lead to commuters&#x27; cards being invalidated. On 19 January 2024, the SimplyGo upgrade feature on ticketing machines at MRT stations have been restricted to &quot;TUK with Supervision&quot;.

On 22 January, transport minister Chee Hong Tat announced that the LTA reversed their decision and decided to extend the use of the card-based system. Those who had converted their cards to the new SimplyGo system during the January period could revert to the old system if they preferred to at no additional cost. Chee also acknowledged that the issues encountered during the transition could have been avoided &quot;with better preparation&quot;. An additional S$40 million (US$ million) would be invested to maintain both systems.

==Technical data==

The EZ-Link card operates on a radio frequency (RF) interface of 13.56 MHz at 212 kbit/s, with the potential for communication speeds in excess of 847 kbit/s. It employs the Manchester bit coding scheme for noise tolerance against distance fluctuation between the card and the contactless reader, and implements the Triple DES algorithm for security.

==Pricing==
An adult EZ-Link card costs S$12, inclusive of a S$5 non-refundable card cost and a $7 card value.

There was a problem with commuters attempting to evade paying the full fare with the prior magnetic fare card system. Under the EZ-Link system, when users tap their card on the entry card reader, the system deducts the maximum fare payable from their bus stop to the end of the bus route. If they tap their card on the exit reader when they disembark, the system will return an amount based on the remaining bus stages to the end of the bus route. If they fail to tap the card on the exit reader when they disembark, the entry card reader would have already deducted the maximum fare payable to the end of the bus route.

==Card top-up==
EZ-Link card holders can top up their cards at the following places:
==Refund==
A Refund Service Charge of $1 will be charged per month for EZ-link cards that have expired for 2 years or more until the value is refunded or fully depleted. This applies to the remaining card balance, and not the initial deposit or cost of the card that is non-refundable. Refund may be requested at ticketing offices. In addition, commuters may replace expiring EZ-link cards before 31 December 2024 at a subsidised cost of $3.

==Comparison of payment modes==
On 10 January 2024, LTA announced that EZ-Link adult cards which have not yet been upgraded to SimplyGo will no longer be accepted for public transport fare payment from 1 June 2024, due to phasing out of the legacy card-based ticketing system. Commuters with EZ-Link Adult Cards may upgrade to the SimplyGo system at any ticketing machine and retain their current cards. The decision was reversed by the authorities on 22 January 2024 following significant backlash, and existing EZ-Link cards can continue to be used after 1 June 2024.

<text>CETME () is a Spanish government design and development establishment. While being involved in many projects CETME was mostly known for its small arms research and development. The Spanish government hired former semiautomatic weapon designers from the Third Reich for the organization.

The CETME Model 58 and CETME Model L are its most notable projects. CETME also designed the CETME C2 9mm submachine gun, and the CETME Ameli light machine gun in 5.56×45mm NATO.

<doc id="966962" wikidata="Q1484457" url="?curid=966962" title="Joan (given name)">
<text>Joan (female name: ; male name: ) is both a feminine form of the personal name &quot;John&quot; given to females in the Anglosphere; and the native masculine form of &quot;John&quot; (for males) in the Catalan-Valencian and Occitan languages. In both cases, the name is derived from the Greek via the Latin and (or and ), and is thus cognate with John and related to its many forms, including its derived feminine forms.

The name was disseminated widely into many languages and cultures from the Greek name (romanised, ), along with its feminine form (romanised, ). Its ultimate origin, as with &quot;John&quot;, is from the Hebrew (), &quot;Graced by Yah&quot;, or (), &quot;Yahweh is Gracious&quot;.

== History ==
The Anglosphere female name &quot;Joan&quot; entered the English language through the Old French forms, &quot;Johanne&quot; and &quot;Jehanne&quot;, female variants of the male name &quot;Johannes&quot;.

In Catalan-Valencian and Occitan, &quot;Joan&quot; () has been in continuous use as the native, masculine form of &quot;John&quot; since at least the Middle Ages. Its feminine counterpart in these languages is &quot;Joana&quot;. Historically, &quot;Joan&quot; and &quot;Joam&quot; were also the main forms of &quot;John&quot; in medieval Portuguese (or Galician-Portuguese). The Lusophone world later diverged in adopting &quot;João&quot; as its native form of the masculine &quot;John&quot;, while &quot;Joana&quot;, as in Catalan and Occitan, remains the female form for Portuguese speakers.

==List of figures named Joan==
Below are lists of people and fictional characters named or known as &quot;Joan&quot;. They are divided by gender and time period and within each list are presented alphabetically, by surname or title.

<text>Thomas George Nevakshonoff (born December 22, 1958) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Manitoba legislature, prior to his defeat in 2016.

Nevakshonoff was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He grew up in Poplarfield and Fisher Branch, Manitoba. He graduated from the Fisher Branch Collegiate Institute in 1977. He then spent eighteen years working in Canada&#x27;s oilfields.

In 1987, Nevakshonoff graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa with a Bachelor of Arts degree in East European Studies. He is from a Doukhobor family that moved to Canada in 1899. Nevakshonoff travelled to Russia in 1991 where he was employed by Canadian companies interested in the Russian oil and gas industries. In 1992, he was commissioned by the Canadian Embassy in Russia to write a petroleum sector study.

He returned to Canada and on his father&#x27;s retirement replaced his father as co-owner of the family business, Aberdeen Lodge, a family-owned lodge located just south of Flin Flon. He married Rozanne Imlah in 2000.

Nevakshonoff was elected to the Manitoba legislature as a New Democrat in the provincial election of 1999, defeating Progressive Conservative Betty Green by 3809 votes to 3260 in the riding of Interlake.

In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party.

Nevakshonoff was re-elected in the 2003 election, defeating Betty Green again by a wider margin. He was returned again in the 2007 election. He is the chair of the NDP&#x27;s Legislative Review Committee of the NDP Caucus and the Standing Committee of Agriculture of the Legislative Assembly. He is also the Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Conservation and the Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation. In 2011, he was named deputy speaker. Nevakshonoff was elected again in 2011.

His great-grandfather Henry Mabb and Frederick Bird, another ancestor, both served in the Manitoba assembly.

<text>The NIST stone test wall is an experiment by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology to determine how different types of construction stone weather. It includes 2352 samples of stone from 47 US states and 16 countries. The wall measures approximately 12 m long, 4 m high, 0.6 m thick at the bottom, and 0.3 m at the top.

It includes varieties of andesite, argillite, basalt, bluestone, breccia, conglomerate, coquina, coral, dacite, diabase, diorite, dolomite, gabbro, gneiss, granite, granodiorite, greenstone, labradorite, limestone, marble, melaphyre, pitchstone, pumice, pyrophyllite, quartz, quartzite, sandstone, schist, serpentinite, shellstone, soapstone, syenite, travertine, and tuff.

The wall was built by one stonemason, Vincent Di Benedeto, in 1948. He used two types of stone-setting mortar on the front. He used both a 1:3 lime mortar, with a high calcium hydrate and a 1:0.4:3 portland cement, whiting, and sand mortar.

The wall was moved from its original location in Washington, D.C. to Gaithersburg, Maryland in May 1977.

<text>The copyright law of Canada governs the legally enforceable rights to creative and artistic works under the laws of Canada. Canada passed its first colonial copyright statute in 1832 but was subject to imperial copyright law established by Britain until 1921. Current copyright law was established by the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; of Canada which was first passed in 1921 and substantially amended in 1988, 1997, and 2012. All powers to legislate copyright law are in the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada by virtue of section 91(23) of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

==History==

===Colonial copyright law===
It is unclear to what extent British copyright law, or imperial law, starting with the 1709 Statute of Anne, applied to its colonies (including Canada), but the House of Lords had ruled in 1774, in &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot;, that copyright was a creation of statute and could be limited in its duration. The first Canadian colonial copyright statute was the &quot;Copyright Act, 1832&quot;, passed by the Parliament of the Province of Lower Canada, granting copyright to residents of the province. The 1832 Act was short, and declared ambitions to encourage emergence of a literary and artistic nation and to encourage literature, bookshops and the local press. After the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada (Ontario and Quebec) were reunified to form the Province of Canada, the 1832 Act was repealed and with minor changes enacted as the &quot;Copyright Act, 1841&quot;.

The 1841 Act only granted copyright in books, maps, charts, musical compositions, prints, cuts and engravings. Copyright was only awarded if it was registered and a copy of the work deposited in the office of the registrar of the province before publication. The author or creator was required to be resident in the province in order to obtain copyright under the Act, though the Act was unclear on whether the work needed to have been first published in the Province. The objective of the colonial copyright statutes was to encourage the printing of books in Canada, though this was not made explicit to avoid conflict with imperial copyright law, which was primarily designed to protect English publishers. Britain forcefully demanded guarantees that British and Irish subjects were eligible for protection under Canadian colonial copyright law in the same way residents of the Canadian colony were.

One year after Canada passed the 1841 act, the UK Parliament passed the Copyright Act 1842. The statute explicitly applied to &quot;all Parts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, all Parts of the East and West India, and all the Colonies, Settlements, and Possessions of the Crown which now are or thereafter may be acquired&quot;. Any book published in London would therefore be protected by copyright law in the entire British Empire, including Canada. The 1842 Act had an immediate impact on Canada and became infamous because it effectively prohibited the importation and sale of reprints of any book under British copyright printed in other countries. Previously Canada had mostly imported books from the United States, but it was now unlawful for Canadian merchants to engage in this trade. Instead merchants were required to import books under British copyright from printers in Britain, though British market prices were unaffordable for most residents of Canada. As British publishers systematically refused to license books for printing to Canadian printers, the Canadian Government questioned the responsible self-government arrangement. In a provocative move Canada passed &quot;An Act to extend the Provincial Copyright Act to Persons Resident in the United Kingdom&quot; in 1847, granting British authors protection only if their works had been printed and published in the Province of Canada. The 1841 and 1847 statutes were subject to minor revision in 1859 and the requirement for the works to be printed in Canada, buried in the text, was later noticed and denounced by the imperial British government.
===Confederation===
Upon Confederation, the British North America Act, 1867 granted the federal government power to legislate on matters such as copyright and patents. In 1868 the Parliament of Canada passed the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; of 1868, which granted protection for &quot;any person resident in Canada, or any person being a British subject, and resident in Great Britain or Ireland.&quot; It re-established the publication requirements of the 1847 statute, prompting demand from the British government that Canada should revise its laws so as to respect imperial copyright law. Under Imperial copyright London printers had a monopoly and attracted most authors from the colonies to first publish with them because imperial copyright law granted protection in all colonies. London printers refused Canadian printers the license to print books first published in London and authors had little incentive to first publish in Canada, as colonial copyright law only granted protection in Canada. The Canadian government sought to further strengthen the Canadian print industry with an 1872 bill that would have introduced a projected licensing scheme that allowed for a reprinting of books under foreign copyright in exchange for a fixed royalty. The British government opposed the bill and it never received royal assent.

In order to encourage the local printing and publishing industry Canada made a number of diplomatic and legislative efforts to limit the effects of the 1842 Imperial act. In a compromise arrangement Canada passed the &quot;Copyright Act, 1875&quot;, which provided for a term of twenty-eight years, with an option to renew for a further fourteen years, for any &quot;literary, scientific and artistic works or compositions&quot; published initially or contemporaneously in Canada, and such protection was available to anyone domiciled in Canada or any other British possession, or a citizen of any foreign country having an international copyright treaty with the United Kingdom, but it was contingent on the work being printed and published (or reprinted and republished) in Canada. By registering under the Canadian Act, British and foreign publishers gained exclusive access to the Canadian market by excluding American reprints.

In 1877, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that the Imperial Copyright Act 1842 continued to have effect in Canada, despite the passage of the Canadian Copyright Act, 1875. This effectively meant that Canadian copyright was a local scheme, whereas Imperial copyright conferred general protection throughout the British Empire. The application of Imperial copyright was strengthened by the earlier decision of the House of Lords in &quot;Routledge v Low&quot;, which declared that residence of an author, no matter how temporary, anywhere in the British dominions while his book was being published in the United Kingdom, was sufficient to secure it. As the United States was not then a signatory to an international copyright treaty (thus rendering its citizens ineligible for Canadian copyright), many Americans took advantage of this ruling by visiting Canada while their books were being published in London (and thereby obtaining Imperial copyright).

There were other significant differences between the Canadian and Imperial régimes:

Under the UK&#x27;s Copyright Act 1911, the Parliament of Canada was granted authority to either extend its application to Canada or to repeal (subject to the preservation of all legal rights existing at the time of such repeal) any or all enactments passed by the Imperial Parliament (including the Act of 1911) so far as operative within the Dominion. Canada opted to exercise the latter choice, and, upon passage of the Copyright Act, 1921, it assumed complete jurisdiction over copyright and Imperial legislation in the matter ceased to have effect.

Canada did not join the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910; adhered to by most Pan-American countries

===Copyright Act, 1921===

The Copyright Act, 1921, came into force in 1924. Though Canada was no longer subject to imperial copyright law, it was closely modelled on the UK Copyright Act 1911:

* the term of copyright was extended to 50 years after the creator&#x27;s death (but, where a work was not yet published at the time of death, its term was extended to 50 years after publication)
* sound recordings were protected &quot;as if such contrivances were musical, literary or dramatic works&quot;
* in the case of an engraving, photograph or portrait, the initial owner of the copyright was the person who commissioned the plate or other original
* any remaining rights (if any) at common law were abolished

Following the UK &quot;Carwardine&quot; case, rights in performer&#x27;s performances were also held to exist under the Canadian Act (although they were never enforced). This was abolished in 1971.

New technological developments and the emergence of computers, photocopiers and recording devices led to a recognition that copyright law needed to be updated. Between 1954 and 1960 the Royal Commission on Patents, Copyright, and Industrial Design, known as the Ilsley Commission, published a series of reports. Its brief was &quot;to enquire as to whether federal legislation relating in any way to patents of invention, industrial designs, copyright and trade-marks affords reasonable incentive to invention and research, to the development of literary and artistic talents, to creativeness, and to making available to the Canadian public scientific, technical, literary and artistic creations and other adaptations, applications and uses, in a manner and on terms adequately safeguarding the paramount public interest.&quot;

====Reform (1988–2012)====

Between 1977 and 1985, a series of reports and proposals were issued for the reform of Canadian copyright law.

Eventually a copyright reform process was initiated in two phases: Phase one was started in 1988 and saw several amendments to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;. Computer programs were included as works protected under copyright, the extent of moral rights was clarified, the provision for a compulsory license for the reproduction of musical works was removed, new licensing arrangements were established for orphan works in cases where the copyright owner could not be found, and rules were enacted on the formation of copyright collecting societies and their supervision by a reformed Copyright Board of Canada.

Phase two of the reform took place in 1997 and saw the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; amended with a new remuneration right for producers and performers of sound recordings when their work was broadcast or publicly performed by radio stations and public places such as bars. A levy was introduced on blank audio tapes used for private copying and exclusive book distributors were granted protection in Canada. New copyright exceptions were introduced for non-profit educational institutions, libraries, museums, broadcasters, and people with disabilities, allowing them to copy copyrighted works in specific circumstances without the permission of the copyright owner or the need to pay royalties. Damages payable for copyright infringement and the power to grant injunctions were increased, and the 1997 reforms introduced a mandatory review of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;. Copyright in unpublished works was limited to 50 years after the creator&#x27;s death, but unpublished works by creators who died after 1948 but before 1999 retain their copyright until 2049.

After becoming a signatory country of World Intellectual Property Organization Internet Treaties in 1996, Canada implemented its terms in 2012 with the passage of the &quot;Copyright Modernization Act&quot;. The 2012 act focuses on anti-circumvention provisions for technical protection measures, the protection of authors&#x27; rights, and the public&#x27;s rights concerning the copying of legally obtained materials. 
During consideration of the bill, many groups publicly stated their opposition to its digital lock specifications, arguing that such measures infringed on legitimate usage of copyright holding. The government rejected many of these criticisms of the TPM provisions.

====Copyright review and consultation process (2017–2019)====
The 2012 amendments to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; included an updated provision for a recurring five-year parliamentary review of the Act. Section 92 of the Act mandates the establishment of a Senate or House of Commons committee for the purpose of carrying out this review. On December 14, 2017, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced plans to commence a parliamentary review of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was given charge of the parliamentary review. The Committee collected 192 briefs (written submissions) and heard testimony from 209 witnesses, concluding its consultation process in December 2018. Submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties, including associations representing students, universities, libraries and researchers; unions, associations and collective management organizations representing writers, artists, and performers; corporations from the communications sector; associations representing the film, theatre and music industries; media organizations; government departments; and representatives of the Copyright Board of Canada. The final report of the Committee was released in June 2019 and contained 36 recommendations.

As part of the review, the Committee also requested that a parallel consultation be conducted by the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, which announced its launch of a Study on Remuneration Models for Artists and Creative Industries in the Context of Copyright on April 10, 2018. The testimony of Canadian musician Bryan Adams given on September 18, 2018 as part of this consultation garnered significant media attention. Adams proposed an amendment to s. 14(1) of the Copyright Act to change the period after which an assignment of copyright would revert to the author 25 years after assignment, rather than 25 years after the death of the author. Adams invited law professor Daniel Gervais to present arguments in support of his proposal. One of the rationales put forward by Professor Gervais was to permit a reasonable period for those assigned copyright to exploit the commercial interest in a work and recoup their investment, while at the same time incentivizing and supporting the creativity of artists by allowing them to regain control within their lifetime.

In addition to the legislated parliamentary review of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;, separate consultations were held with respect to the Copyright Board of Canada. In August 2017, Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada, the Department of Canadian Heritage, and the Copyright Board of Canada issued &quot;A Consultation on Options for Reform to the Copyright Board of Canada,&quot; a document outlining the potential scope and nature of reforms to the legislative and regulatory framework governing the Copyright Board of Canada and soliciting comments from the public. The consultation period concluded September 29, 2017. A fact sheet published by Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada summarized the key issues raised in the consultation and announced a 30% increase to funding to the Board to address significant time delays in tariff-setting. Bill C-86, an Act implementing provisions of the 2018 federal budget, received royal assent on December 13, 2018. The Act implemented amendments to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; in relation to the administration of the Copyright Board.

While the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; review was being carried out, trade negotiations leading to the USMCA were ongoing. Law professor Michael Geist noted that the terms of the USMCA relating to intellectual property would need to be taken into consideration by the review Committee and would require changing provisions of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; that were amended in the last round of copyright reform in 2012.

====Extension of copyright for certain sound recordings (2015)====
From June 23, 2015, the rules governing copyright protection were modified to provide that copyright in unpublished sound recordings created on or after that date would last for 50 years after fixation, but if the sound recording is published before the copyright expires, the applicable term would then be the earlier of 70 years from its publication or 100 years from fixation. By implication, this will also extend the copyright for performer&#x27;s performances contained in such recordings.

====Extension of copyright for published pseudonymous or anonymous works (2020)====
From July 1, 2020, the rules governing copyright protection for published pseudonymous or anonymous works were extended by 25 years. This extension did not have the effect of reviving a copyright.

====Extension of copyright term====
Under the conditions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement the copyright term would have been extended to life plus 70 years. Although it was signed by Canada in February 2016, this treaty was not ratified, and did not go into effect. Under its successor, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Canada&#x27;s copyright term did not change.
Canada continued to hold to the Berne Convention standard, which is life of the author plus 50 years. In addition the Berne Convention provides that extensions of terms will not have the effect of reviving previously expired copyrights. Article 14.6 of the TRIPs Agreement makes similar provision for the rights of performers and producers in sound recordings.

The United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement proposed the extension of Canada&#x27;s copyright term to life plus 70 years, while performances and sound recordings will be protected for 75 years. It has been signed and ratified. This agreement replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement. In its May 2019 report, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage has recommended that the extension be implemented. The bill introduced to implement the USMCA did not include the extension language. This was reportedly done to allow a transition period to determine the best way to meet the extension obligation. A commitment to the obligation was included in the 2022 Canadian federal budget.

The extension of Canada&#x27;s copyright term to life plus 70 years was formalized via amendment to the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; on 23 June 2022, which came into force on 30 December 2022, but did not revive expired copyright.

The Writers&#x27; Union of Canada has expressed strong support for copyright extension. Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams argues that extensions may increase profits to intermediaries such as major record labels, but do not benefit the actual creators of copyrighted works. He believes that copyright law should include a change to revert rights back to the creator after 25 years. Proponents of a strong public domain argue that extending copyright terms will further limit creativity and argue that &quot;there is no evidence to suggest that the private benefits of copyright term extensions ever outweigh the costs to the public.&quot; The Canadian Confederation of Library Associations disagrees with the extension. But it believes some of the problems can be mitigated by, among other things, requiring each work be formally registered in order to receive the 20 year extension.

==Rights conferred==
The Act confers several types of rights in works:

* copyright
* moral rights
* neighbouring rights

Copyright includes the right to first publish, reproduce, perform, transmit and show a work in public. It includes other subsidiary rights such as abridgment and translation.

Moral rights were instituted upon Canada&#x27;s accession to the Berne Convention, and they possess several key attributes: attribution, integrity and association. They allow the author of a work to determine how it is being used and what it is being associated to.

Neighbouring rights generally discussed in the music industry (e.g. performer&#x27;s rights, recording rights) are a series of rights relating to one piece of work, and were established upon Canada&#x27;s accession to the Rome Convention. They do not relate to the creative works themselves, but to their performance, transmission and reproduction.

Similar protection is extended to copyright holders in countries that are parties to:

* the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
* the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations,
* the WIPO Copyright Treaty, and
* the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.

===Freedom of panorama===
==Protected works==

A work must be original and can include literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works or compilations. Copyright is granted the moment the work is created and does not distinguish work of a professional or that of an amateur. There is also no distinction between for profit or commercial use or for hobby purposes. Literary work includes anything that is written, such as speeches, essays and books and may be in any form. However, a short string of words or spontaneous speech is not covered. Dramatic works include the characters, scenes, choreography, cinematography, relationship between characters, dialogue and dramatic expression. Artistic works include sculptures, paintings, photographs, charts and engravings. Musical works include any musical compositions with or without words. Unexpressed ideas are not protected work.

Copyright also extends to incomplete creations such as proposals, treatments and formats, and infringement can occur when subsequent audiovisual works use their elements without ever actually literally copying them.

It is unclear whether the subjects in interviews have copyright in the words they utter (and thus be considered to be their authors), as the courts have not definitively ruled on the issues of originality and fixation in such cases. However, in &quot;Gould Estate v Stoddart Publishing Co Ltd&quot;, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that &quot;offhand comments that [the interviewee] knew could find their way into the public domain ... [were] not the kind of disclosure which the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; intended to protect.&quot;

Ownership of a creative work may be assigned to a corporation or other employer as part of an employment contract. In such a cases, the employer retains ownership of the creative work even after the contract ends. The new copyright owner is therefore free to make changes to the finished product without the creator&#x27;s consent.

A creative employee, meanwhile, may continue to use his or her experience, expertise, and memory to create a similar product after the conclusion of a contract. In 2002, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a literal interpretation of the word &quot;copy&quot; and found that a software engineer&#x27;s creation of a &quot;similar&quot; product from memory did not constitute infringement of his former employer&#x27;s copyright.

===Fair dealing===

Unauthorized copying of works can be permissible under the fair dealing exemption. In &quot;CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada made a number of comments regarding fair dealing, and found that the placement of a photocopier in a law library did not constitute an invitation to violate copyright. In &quot;Alberta (Education) v Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright)&quot;, the Court further clarified this exemption from copyright law in the context of education, finding that a teacher may photocopy a brief excerpt from a textbook in circumstances where it would be impractical to purchase a text book for each student.

Fair dealing is to be examined on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of the dealing, character of the dealing, amount of the dealing, alternatives of the dealing, nature of the work and effect of the dealing are factors that can contribute to fair dealing. Those favouring a broad interpretation of fair dealing argue there ought to be reasonable unauthorized reproduction of works because it facilitates creativity and free expression. They also argue that fair dealing provides reasonable access to existing knowledge. Those arguing that fair dealing ought to be more restrictive and specific state that fair dealing will reduce revenue to those creating works. They also argue the reproduction of works and sends a wrong message to the public that works are free as long as it falls under this banner. Their economic argument is that fair dealing should not compensate for the market&#x27;s inability to meet the demand for public knowledge.

The impact of the &quot;CCH&quot; analysis has been problematic, and many users have attempted to simplify the administration through the adoption of guidelines quantifying what amounts of a work may be acceptable. The Federal Court of Canada pointed out in 2017, when invalidating guidelines that had been adopted by York University, that this is not an easy exercise. Emphasis was given to the fact that the &quot;CCH&quot; six-factor test was the second part of a two-stage analysis in which a user must first identify whether a use was allowed before then assessing whether dealing is fair, and stressed that users must not conflate the two stages.

===Public domain===

====General rule====
Subject to other provisions of the Act, a work will fall into the public domain:

# 50 years after publication, in nearly all cases, if it was subject to Crown copyright.
# 70 years after the death of its creator.
# if the author is unknown, 75 years after publication or 100 years after its creation (whichever is less), otherwise (if not published) 75 years after its creation.
# if it is a communications signal, 50 years after the signal is broadcast.

In all cases:

# copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in which the relevant date falls.
# in the case of joint authorship of a work, copyright extends from the death of the last surviving author.
# in the case of a pseudonymous or anonymous work where one or more of the creators have become commonly known, the normal rules governing authorship apply.
# where the author is the first owner of the copyright and has subsequently assigned it (other than by will), the assignment will only extend to 25 years after the author&#x27;s death, after which copyright will revert to the author&#x27;s estate.
# moral rights in a work have the same term as the copyright in it, and cannot be assigned (other than by inheritance), but can be waived in whole or in part.

====Posthumous works====
Before the 1999 reform of the Act, works that were published after the death of the author were protected by copyright for 50 years after publication, thus granting perpetual copyright to any work not yet published. This was revised so that protection is limited as follows:

====Photographs====
The &quot;Copyright Modernization Act&quot;, which came into force on November 7, 2012, altered the rules with respect to the term of copyright with respect to photographs so that the creator holds the copyright and moral rights to them, and the general rule of life plus 50 years thereafter applies all such works. However, there are two schools of thought with respect to how copyright applies to photographs created before that date:

#Some commentators believe that the transitional rules implemented in the 1999 reform still apply.
#Others assert that such rules were ousted when the 2012 act came into force, and that the general rule under s. 6 of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot; governs. This may also have had the collateral effect of reviving copyright in some works that had previously lapsed.

The differences between the two points of view can be summarized as follows:

There is some controversy as to the legal status of photographs taken before 1949 in the first scenario, as it can be argued that the current practice of statutory interpretation in the courts would hold that copyright protection was moved to the general rule by the 1999 reform to such photographs that were taken by individuals or creator-controlled corporations. In any case, this argument states that the 2012 act effectively removed all such special rules that were formerly contained in s. 10 of the &quot;Copyright Act&quot;.

There has not yet been any jurisprudence in the matter, but it is suggested that previous cases, together with the 2012 act&#x27;s legislative history, may favour the second scenario.

====Sound recordings and performance rights====
Before September 1, 1997, copyright in sound recordings was defined as being in &quot;records, perforated rolls and other contrivances by means of which sounds may be mechanically reproduced.&quot; From that date, they are defined as being &quot;a recording, fixed in any material form, consisting of sounds, whether or not of a performance of a work, but excludes any soundtrack of a cinematographic work where it accompanies the cinematographic work.&quot; Subject to that observation, such recordings will fall into the public domain:

# for sound recordings created before 1965, 50 years after fixation, but if the sound recording is published before the copyright expires, 50 years after its publication (but only where copyright expires before 2015).
# for sound recordings created otherwise, 50 years after fixation, but if the sound recording is published before the copyright expires, the earlier of 70 years from its publication or 100 years from fixation.

Performance rights (in their current form) subsisting in sound recordings did not exist until 1994 (with respect to their producers) or 1996 (with respect to their performers). Performer&#x27;s performances that occurred in a WTO member country only received protection after 1995. Effective September 1, 1997, performance rights were extended to performances captured on communication signals. Subject to that, such performances will fall into the public domain:

# for performer&#x27;s performances before 1962, the earlier of 50 years after its first fixation in a sound recording, or 50 years after its performance, if not fixed in a sound recording (but only where copyright expires before 2012).
# for performer&#x27;s performances created on or after 1962 but before 2015, 50 years after the performance occurs, but (a) if the performance is fixed in a sound recording, 50 years after its fixation, and (b) if a sound recording in which the performance is fixed is published before the copyright expires, the earlier of 50 years after publication and 99 years after the performance occurs (but only where copyright expires before 2015).
# for performer&#x27;s performances created otherwise, 50 years after the performance occurs, but (a) if the performance is fixed in a sound recording, 50 years after its fixation, and (b) if a sound recording in which the performance is fixed is published before the copyright expires, the earlier of 70 years after publication and 100 years from fixation.

=== Anti-circumvention ===
Any circumvention of technical protection measures designed to protect a copyrighted work is unlawful, even if the action was not for the purpose of copyright infringement. The marketing and distribution of products meant to breach technical protection measures is also unlawful. Exceptions exist in situations when the circumvention is for the purposes of accessibility, encryption research, privacy and security testing, reverse engineering to achieve software compatibility (if it is not already possible to do so without breaching TPMs), the creation of temporary recordings by broadcasters, and for law enforcement and national security purposes.

The federal court adopted a wide interpretation of the anti-circumvention rules in the case of &quot;Nintendo of America v. Go Cyber Shopping&quot;, asserting that alongside their use for enabling the use of pirated copies of software for them, a retailer of modchips for video game consoles could not use the availability of homebrew software as a defence under the interoperability provision, because Nintendo offers official manner for developers to create games for their platforms, thus making it possible to achieve interoperability without breaching TPMs.

==Administration==
The Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), part of Industry Canada, administers intellectual property laws concerning the registration of patents, trade-marks, copyrights, industrial designs and integrated circuit topographies.

===Copyright Board===

The Copyright Board of Canada is an evidence based decision making tribunal that has four primary functions: (1) establish royalties users must pay for copyrighted works; (2) establish when the collection of such royalties is to be facilitated by a &quot;collective-administration society&quot;; (3) oversee agreements between users and licensing bodies; and (4) grant users licenses for works when the copyright owner cannot be located.

Collection of royalties and enforcement of copyright is often too costly and difficult for Individual owners of works. Therefore, collectives are formed to facilitate the collection of fees. Collectives may file proposed tariff with the Copyright Board or enter into agreements with users.

<text>Bridewell Palace in London was built as a residence of King Henry VIII and was one of his homes early in his reign for eight years. Given to the City of London Corporation by his son King Edward VI in 1553 as Bridewell Hospital for use as an orphanage and place of correction for wayward women, Bridewell later became the first prison/poorhouse to have an appointed doctor. 

It was built on the banks of the Fleet River in the City of London between Fleet Street and the River Thames in an area today known as Bridewell Place, off New Bridge Street. By 1556 part of it had become a jail known as Bridewell Prison. It was reinvented with lodgings and was closed in 1855 and the buildings demolished in 1863–1864.

The name &quot;Bridewell&quot; subsequently became a common name for a jail, used not only in England but in other cities colonised by Britain including Dublin and New York.

==History==
===Bridewell Palace===
The palace was built on the site of the medieval St Bride&#x27;s Inn directly south of St Bride&#x27;s Church at a cost of £39,000 for Henry VIII who treated it as a main London residence 1515–1523. Standing on the banks of the River Fleet, the related saint since the medieval age has been St Bride. The papal delegation had preliminary meetings here in 1528 before advising the pope on whether the King could divorce Catherine of Aragon. The building was a project of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.

Bridewell Palace consisted of two brick-built courtyards, with the royal lodgings in three storeys around the inner courtyard. A grand processional staircase led to them from the outer courtyard. Bridewell was the first royal palace not to have a great hall and its staircase was a feature that recurs in Henry VIII&#x27;s later residences. On the north side of the outer courtyard stood the kitchens and gatehouse. There was a long gallery () which connected the inner court with Blackfriars, issuing out at Apothecaries Hall on Blackfriars Lane which formerly ran beyond its western façade.

After Wolsey&#x27;s fall in 1530, the palace was leased to the French ambassador 1531–1539, and was the setting for Holbein&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; (1533).

===Bridewell Prison and Orphanage===

In 1553, Edward VI gave the palace over to the City of London for the housing of homeless children and for the punishment of &quot;disorderly women&quot;. The City took full possession in 1556 and turned the site into a prison, hospital and workrooms. In 1557 the City authorities created a joint administration for the Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals when Bethlem Royal Hospital also became the responsibility of the Bridewell Governors.

In the late 17th century, the infamous London brothel keeper Elizabeth Cresswell was incarcerated in Bridewell Prison, possibly for reneging on a debt. She died there at some point between 1684 and 1698. 
She is probably interred in the Bridewell graveyard and legend runs that in her will she left £10 for a sermon to be read that said nothing ill of her. After considerable time, a young clergyman was found who would perform the funeral rites. After an extremely lengthy sermon on social morality, he said &quot;By the will of the deceased it is expected that I should mention her and say nothing but what was well of her. All I shall say of her, therefore, is this — she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born with the name of Cresswell, lived at Clerkenwell, and died in Bridewell.&quot; 
Most of the palace was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and rebuilt in 1666–1667. In 1700 it became the first prison to appoint medical staff (a doctor).

===Bridewell Royal Hospital School===

Eventually, the prison became a school confusingly and variously known as Bridewell (Royal Hospital/School/Royal Hospital School). The prison element closed in 1855 and the buildings were demolished in 1863–1864. Nevertheless, some prison activities continued on the site: in the 1871 census, the Beadle and Turnkey, Joseph Ashley, had charge of two prisoners; and in 1881 Mr Ashley was still there as Collector and Beadle, but no prisoners are named. 
The school moved in 1867 to a much larger site in Surrey and changed its name to King Edward&#x27;s School, Witley which accordingly celebrated its 450th year in 2003.

Part of the vacated site was used for the erection of De Keyser&#x27;s Royal Hotel in 1874, which was requisitioned for military purposes in 1915 and became the subject of a leading case on the use of the royal prerogative decided by the House of Lords in 1920. By 1921 Lever Brothers had acquired the hotel building for use as the head office of the company&#x27;s business.

===Site today===
A rebuilt gatehouse in the style of the original is incorporated as the front of the office block at 14 New Bridge Street, including a relief portrait of Edward VI. The main site area of the buildings stretched from there southwards through the Hyatt Regency London Blackfriars Hotel to Unilever House (built in 1931) which stands at the corner of Watergate – the name of the lost river entrance to the palace&#x27;s precincts beside the former Fleet-Thames confluence (memorialised in the name of the street between the two).

===Influence, legacy, and in popular culture===

The name &quot;Bridewell&quot; became synonymous with large prisons and was consequently used as a generic name for them. It was adopted for other prisons in London, including the Clerkenwell Bridewell (opened in 1615) and Tothill Fields Bridewell in Westminster. Similar institutions throughout England, Ireland, Scotland and Canada as well as in the United States also borrowed the name Bridewell. The term frequently refers to a city&#x27;s main detention facility, usually close to a courthouse, as in Nottingham, Leeds, Gloucester, Bristol, Dublin, Cork and Edinburgh.

In the Beatles film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Paul&#x27;s grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) reports the arrest of Ringo to the studio by saying &quot;The police have the poor lad in the Bridewell – he&#x27;ll be pulp by now!&quot;

The nearby Bridewell Theatre takes its name from the palace.

<text>Vasco Fernandes Coutinho (1490–1561) was a Portuguese fidalgo and the first donatary of the Captaincy of Espírito Santo, a colonial territory in what is now Brazil.

==Biography==
Vasco Fernandes Coutinho was born in Portugal. He was later amongst the first 12 volunteers from Portugal to come to the newly discovered land of Brazil. In order to finance the crew and provisions needed to sail a single ship to Brazil, Coutinho sold everything he owned and took out loans. He was presented the area which became Espírito Santo and administered the colony for 25 years, despite being a military man by trade.

He founded both the first capital of Espírito Santo (today known as Vila Velha, &quot;Old Town&quot;) and the current capital Vitória.

During his administration Espírito Santo&#x27;s first two churches – São João and Rosário, both in Vila Velha – were founded in 1551. Both are still standing.

<doc id="966989" wikidata="Q7782889" url="?curid=966989" title="Theresa Oswald">
<text>Theresa Oswald is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a New Democratic Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 2003 to 2016 and a cabinet minister from 2004 until she stepped down in 2014 to unsuccessfully challenge Premier Greg Selinger for the party&#x27;s leadership.

==Early life==
Oswald was born and raised in the St. Vital neighbourhood of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was a teacher and school administrator for fifteen years before entering politics. She initially taught English, later serving as vice-principal at Victor Mager School, Winnipeg in the Louis Riel Division. In the latter capacity, she frequently worked with children and families who arrived in Canada from war-ravaged countries. Oswald has also been involved in local groups such as the Victoria Hospital, the Zoological Society of Manitoba and Take Pride Winnipeg!.

==Political career==
Oswald was part of the NDP&#x27;s historic breakthrough in south-end Winnipeg in the provincial election of 2003, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Louise Dacquay in the riding of Seine River, 4,314 votes to 3,582. The NDP had never won this riding before. Oswald&#x27;s campaign focused on greater access to post-secondary education and a tuition freeze for university students.

In August 2004, Oswald was appointed to lead a task-force committee looking for ways to encourage physical activity in the province&#x27;s youth.

Oswald was appointed as a cabinet minister in Gary Doer&#x27;s government on October 12, 2004, serving as the Minister responsible for Healthy Living, Seniors and Healthy Child Manitoba. In 2006, she was promoted to Minister of Health, where she introduced bold new initiatives such as making a family doctor available to every Manitoban, new investments in women&#x27;s and maternal health, promoted organ donation and introduced groundbreaking legislation to require life-saving heart defibrillators in public places. Her work to improve cancer care, including making all cancer drugs available to patients at no charge, was celebrated by the Canadian Cancer Society with a Diamond Jubilee medal.

She was re-elected with an increased majority in the 2007 provincial election.

In 2013 she was again promoted to lead the government&#x27;s new flagship department of Jobs and the Economy, where she has since focused on expanding access to training programs to help increase the supply of skilled workers, expanded supports for start-ups and young entrepreneurs and introduced a boost to housing benefits for those on social assistance and the working poor.

===Challenge to Selinger&#x27;s leadership===
Oswald resigned her cabinet position on November 3, 2014, along with Jennifer Howard, Erin Selby, Stan Struthers, and Andrew Swan due to concerns about Premier Selinger&#x27;s leadership. On December 21, 2014, Oswald declared her candidacy for the party leadership. Oswald was defeated by a margin of 33 votes on the second ballot at the leadership convention on March 8, 2015, by Selinger. Oswald remained an MLA after her defeat but did not run for re-election as an MLA in the 2016 provincial election.

<doc id="966993" wikidata="Q3433762" url="?curid=966993" title="Nashwaak River">
<text>The Nashwaak River, located in west-central New Brunswick, Canada, is a tributary of the Saint John River. It is 113 kilometres long, draining an area of roughly . The river drains south from Nashwaak Lake (southeast of the village of Juniper) before turning east to flow through the village of Stanley and the community of Nashwaak, continuing southeast to Nashwaak Bridge and then south through several rural communities such as Taymouth, Durham Bridge, Nashwaak Village, and Penniac before entering Fredericton through Marysville and dividing the neighbourhoods of Barkers Point and Devon. Its mouth is divided by a small island before it spills into the Saint John River.

It was used heavily by the Wolastoqey people as a transportation route to northwestern New Brunswick. A French fort, Fort Nashwaak, was built somewhere near the river&#x27;s mouth in 1692 and was the first European settlement in the Fredericton area. It was captured by the British in 1696, and land along the river was later granted to United Empire Loyalists during the American Revolution. Further settlement occurred through the 19th century. 

A rail line (the former Canadian National Nashwaak subdivision) and Route 8, both important links from southern to northern New Brunswick, were built along the river&#x27;s shore. The Nashwaak subdivision&#x27;s rails were removed in 1995, and it is now an ATV and walking trail. In addition to the Nashwaak subdivision, the Minto subdivision, which passed from South Devon to Minto crossing the Nashwaak near its mouth, and has also since been converted to a walking trail (in-city) and ATV trail (out-of-city). A walking trail makes use of the right-of-way created by a short rail spur that used to followed the river on its east bank from Barkers Point to the Marysville Cotton Mill.

Today, the river is popular for recreational paddling, fishing, and tubing, while the trails alongside it are attractive for ATV riding and bicycling.

== Ecological issues ==

=== Salmon ===
Atlantic salmon were plentiful in the Nashwaak River in the 19th century, but salmon populations in the entire Saint John River Basin plummeted through the 20th century. This has been attributed to a combination of habitat destruction by lumbering, mining and agriculture, overfishing, damming of rivers and aquaculture. Many of the factors apply in the Nashwaak basin. In the Nashwaak river, salmon counts declined from around 2,000 in the 1970s, to a few dozen in the 2010s. Salmon fishing has been banned since 1998. The Campbell Creek dam in Marysville was removed in 2021, in an attempt to increase viable spawning habitat.

Aquaculture practices from upstream in the Saint John River have caused a dramatic drop in the salmon population of the Nashwaak river. In the past, the river was known for its abundance of salmon but fish numbers have decreased due to farming in various locations along the Saint John and in the Bay of Fundy. Fish raised in these hatcheries do not tend to migrate along their natural predecessors&#x27; routes up the Nashwaak as they once did due to the removal of a biological memory system developed over the ages to ensure their survival and propagation. Modern dams and netting practices prevent the fish from returning to previously established spawning routes. Over time this practice has altered the memory of the species and therefore diminished the number previously documented in the Nashwaak river system.

This process has been documented as being problematic in other locations around the world; as Ellen Wohl points out, &quot;Similar attempts either to provide fish passage around a dam or to breed fish in a hatchery have been dismal failures for salmon and other species in the United States.&quot;

== Nashwaak Watershed Association Inc. ==
The Nashwaak Watershed Association Incorporated (NWAI) is a non-profit organization established in 1995 to promote, protect, and restore the water, land, flora, and fauna within the Nashwaak watershed. Its programs include replanting and restoration of floodplain forests previously converted to farmland, riverbank erosion mitigation, fish passage restoration (culvert remediation/removal, dam removal), and species-at-risk monitoring (including Outer Bay of Fundy Atlantic salmon and bank swallows). 

Notable achievements of the organization include the coordination of the removal of the 1919 Campbell Creek dam, and the replanting of, and designation of, the Marysville Flats as a conservation easement.

<doc id="967001" wikidata="Q802537" url="?curid=967001" title="Sterling Highway">
<text>The Sterling Highway is a state highway in the south-central region of the U.S. state of Alaska, leading from the Seward Highway at Tern Lake Junction, south of Anchorage, to Homer. To assist in agricultural transport and also open areas to tourism, work began on the Sterling Highway in 1946 to connect the Kenai Peninsula agricultural area with Seward. This highway honors Hawley W. Sterling, lifetime ARC engineer who served as assistant chief engineer from 1932 until his death in 1948.

The importance of the Sterling Highway was described in the Anchorage Daily Times article on its dedication in 1950:It is the great achievement in the penetration of barriers that have kept Alaska’s development confined to shoreline establishments dependent upon marine transportation. The new road will give otherwise isolated peninsula farms access to markets for their farm products. In another year it will link the communities with Anchorage by way of the Turnagain Arm road, and all the cities of the continental United States by the way of the Alaska Highway. It opens up the great potential tourist and sportsmen developments by making the fishing, lakes and streams readily accessible by automobile. Alaska families will be able to live year round on their homesteads or fishing sites now that the Sterling Highway and its side roads enable their children to commute to school, give them access to medical aid and make it possible to move supplies as needed.The Sterling Highway opened to traffic during the winter of 1950, when temperatures below freezing made it possible to travel over the unfinished surface. However, the highway required grading and gravel surfacing before being ready for summer traffic the following year.

==Route description==
The Sterling Highway is part of Alaska Route 1. It leads mainly west from Tern Lake to Soldotna, paralleling the Kenai River, at which point it turns south to follow the eastern shore of Cook Inlet. It is the only highway in the western and central Kenai Peninsula, and most of the population of the Kenai Peninsula Borough lives near it. The highway also gives access to many extremely popular fishing and recreation areas, including the Chugach National Forest, Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, and the Kenai, Funny, and Russian rivers. The southern end of the highway is at the tip of the Homer Spit, a landspit extending into Kachemak Bay. A ferry terminal here connects the road to the Alaska Marine Highway.

==Interstate Highway System==
Sterling Highway is part of the unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System as Interstate A-3.

==Major intersections==
Mileposts on the Sterling Highway begin with Mile 37 (60 km), continuing from the mileposts of the Seward Highway. (The 0 (zero) mile marker for the Seward Highway is in downtown Seward, at the intersection of 3rd and Railway Avenues. Thus, mileposts along the Sterling Highway reflect distance from Seward, which is not actually on the Sterling Highway.

<doc id="967007" wikidata="Q631442" url="?curid=967007" title="Chinese Democracy">
<text>Chinese Democracy is the sixth studio album by the American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released on November 23, 2008, by Black Frog and Geffen Records. It was the first Guns N&#x27; Roses studio album since the 1993 covers album &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, and their first album of original studio material since &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; (1991). It languished in development hell for eight years, delayed by personnel and legal problems, label interference, and the perfectionism of vocalist Axl Rose. It was the first Guns N&#x27; Roses album without Izzy Stradlin, Slash, and Duff McKagan, and the first not produced by Mike Clink, instead, it was produced by Rose and Caram Costanzo.

After the Use Your Illusion Tour ended in 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses spent several years rehearsing ideas for a new album. However, several members left following creative and personal differences with Rose, and no music was released. In 1998, Rose, keyboardist Dizzy Reed, and guitarist Paul Tobias, alongside new members, guitarist Robin Finck, drummer Josh Freese, bassist Tommy Stinson, and multi-instrumentalist Chris Pitman began writing and recording new songs. Originally intended for a 1999 release, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was rerecorded and delayed multiple times. The lineup shifted several times, guitarists Buckethead, Richard Fortus, and Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal and drummers Brain and Frank Ferrer all contributed. The band recorded over 50 songs, intending to release multiple albums. With costs reportedly exceeding $13 million ($ in current dollar terms), it became the most expensive rock album ever produced.

&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was promoted with the Chinese Democracy Tour (2001–2011), gaining notoriety for canceled shows and riots. After missing a release date of March 2007, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was released in November 2008, dogged by leaks and legal disputes. The release was preceded by the title track as the lead single. The album was distributed exclusively by Best Buy stores in North America and debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was certified platinum. It received generally favorable reviews, achieved international chart success, and sold over one million copies in Europe. Critics praised Rose&#x27;s vocal performance and the instrumentation, although several criticized the production and claimed the album sounded dated. Retrospective reviews have been mostly favorable, noting the extended recording process and delays often overshadowed the music.

==Background==

In September 1991, Guns N&#x27; Roses released the albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot;, which have sold a combined 35 million copies. In November 1991, during the Use Your Illusion Tour, rhythm guitarist and founding member Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band, citing touring exhaustion and conflicts with his bandmates. He was replaced by Gilby Clarke. In November 1993, Guns N&#x27; Roses released &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, an album of covers of mostly glam rock and punk rock songs. Though it was certified platinum in 1994, it sold significantly less than their previous releases, and the band did not tour in support of the album.

Guns N&#x27; Roses began writing and recording new music in 1994. However, bassist Duff McKagan said the band &quot;was so stoned at that point that nothing got finished&quot;. Guitarist Slash accused singer Axl Rose of running the band &quot;like a dictatorship&quot;. Rose said the material was scrapped because the band was unable to collaborate.

In 1994, Clarke was replaced by Rose&#x27;s childhood friend and Hollywood Rose collaborator Paul Tobias. Around this time, Rose became &quot;obsessed&quot; with electronica and industrial rock, particularly the work of Nine Inch Nails, and wanted Guns N&#x27; Roses to move towards a more contemporary musical direction. Other members did not agree, causing a rift. In early 1995 guitarist Zakk Wylde was brought in to audition as a second guitarist. Slash left in 1996 following creative differences with Rose and personal problems with Tobias. Slash was replaced in January 1997 by former Nine Inch Nails touring guitarist Robin Finck.

In February 1997, electronic producer Moby entered talks to produce; he said: &quot;They&#x27;re writing with a lot of loops, and believe it or not, they&#x27;re doing it better than anybody I&#x27;ve heard lately.&quot; Moby pulled out to focus on his solo work. Longtime Guns N&#x27; Roses producer Mike Clink is also reported to have been in talks to work on the album that year. Scott Litt, Steve Lillywhite, and Mark Bell were all considered as producers.

In April 1997, drummer Matt Sorum was fired after an argument with Rose about Tobias&#x27;s inclusion. Drummers Dave Abbruzzese and Michael Bland auditioned for the band, with Reed&#x27;s friend and roommate Sean Riggs working as a session drummer sporadically. Former Nine Inch Nails touring drummer Chris Vrenna was then brought in to audition for several months, and the tentative lineup was Rose, McKagan, Tobias, Finck, Vrenna and keyboardist Dizzy Reed. After Vrenna left, Josh Freese (The Vandals, Devo) was hired as the full-time drummer in mid-1997. Freese was inspired to join when Rose wanted him to contribute to songwriting, atypical for his experiences as a drummer. McKagan, who had recently become a father, left in August 1997. McKagan was frustrated with the lack of progress: &quot;Guns had been paying rent on studios for three years now—from 1994 to 1997—and still did not have a single song. The whole operation was so erratic that it didn&#x27;t seem to fit with my hopes for parenthood, for stability.&quot;

Tool collaborator Chris Pitman joined as a second keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist in early 1998. On Freese&#x27;s recommendation, the band hired bassist Tommy Stinson of The Replacements. By early 1998, Guns N&#x27; Roses comprised Rose on vocals, Stinson on bass, Freese on drums, Finck on lead guitar, Tobias on rhythm guitar, and Reed and Pitman on keyboards.

==Recording==
===Early sessions with Youth===
In February 1998, the band&#x27;s manager Doug Goldstein said &quot;[the band is] three to five months away from actually recording, but [don&#x27;t] expect a record until 1999.&quot;

In early 1998, the band began recording at Rumbo Recorders, a studio in the San Fernando Valley where Guns N&#x27; Roses had recorded parts of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). Around this time, Geffen paid Rose $1 million to finish the album and offered a further $1 million if he submitted it by March 1, 1999. Geffen brought in A&amp;R man James Barber to help the band, &quot;Nothing else had worked, so Geffen figured they&#x27;d send me in to talk to Axl after I moved to Los Angeles. No expense was spared; they were the biggest band in the history of the label... We desperately wanted the new album for Christmas 1998 and I had a year to get it finished.&quot; Barber later said the music the band was working on was &quot;pretty incredible, [still sounding] like GNR, but with Led Zeppelin, Nine Inch Nails and Pink Floyd mixed in. If Axl had recorded vocals, it would have been an absolutely contemporary record in 1999.&quot;

In mid-1998, producer Youth (U2, the Verve) was brought in to work on demos and help Rose focus. Youth felt that Rose was not ready to record a new album, stating &quot;He kind of pulled out ... He was quite isolated. There weren&#x27;t very many people I think he could trust.&quot; Frustrated, Youth left the project. Rose later said he had stopped writing for years in the mid-1990s because of criticism from bandmates and his ex-fiancée Stephanie Seymour. Rose did not appear in the studio every day. Engineer Dave Dominguez said: &quot;He&#x27;d be &#x27;on&#x27; for a couple of weeks and then &#x27;off&#x27; for a couple weeks. He called in pretty much every day, though. He&#x27;d ask who was there, what they were doing.&quot; Rose rarely sang while attending sessions, occasionally performing instruments with the band and spending many nights casually discussing non-music-related topics. Rose ordered the studio engineers to continue recording ideas the band came up with in his absence. He was sent several CDs and DATs a week, featuring different mixes of possible songs. Eventually, he accumulated over 1000 CDs.

Goldstein said the band had &quot;more than 300 hours&quot; worth of recorded material, &quot;they each take a CD home, listen for cool parts, pick them out, and that&#x27;s how they build songs.&quot; Dominguez recalled the process: 
===Sean Beavan joins===
The band worked with producer Sean Beavan from late 1998 to early 2000. Stinson said that &quot;most of the songs on the album started and ended with what [Beavan] did&quot;. Beavan recorded Rose&#x27;s vocals in less than a week, most of which are the takes appearing on the final release. Beavan claimed to have worked on 35 songs during his time with the band. Billy Howerdel worked as a Pro Tools engineer during the album&#x27;s early development, saying: &quot;I came in, to start, making sounds for Robin Finck, and that kind of turned into this two-and-a-half-year gig with the band.&quot; At one point, Rose temporarily abandoned the album so the new lineup could rerecord Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987), with the intent of using newer recording techniques to &quot;spruce up&quot; &quot;Appetite&quot;. According to Rose, this forced the new members to &quot;get up to the quality they needed to be at&quot; and helped the writing and recording process. In May 1999, Queen guitarist Brian May recorded guitar for several songs. By mid-1999, Guns N&#x27; Roses had recorded over 30 songs, and the album was tentatively titled &quot;2000 Intentions&quot;.

=== Title announcement and &quot;Oh My God&quot; ===

During a 1999 interview, Rose announced the title &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, saying: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of Chinese democracy movements, and it&#x27;s something that there&#x27;s a lot of talk about, and it&#x27;s something that will be nice to see. It could also just be like an ironic statement. I don&#x27;t know, I just like the sound of it.&quot; Rose also said the album would feature a &quot;melting pot&quot; of varied sounds, including several heavy and aggressive songs. In late November 1999, Rose played several tracks for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who likened the new sound to &quot;Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; remixed by Beck and Trent Reznor&quot;. In 1997 and 1998, sources had described the album as different from previous Guns N&#x27; Roses records, with an electronic influence. Chris Vrenna said that Rose wanted to create an album similar to U2 and Brian Eno&#x27;s collaboration &quot;Original Soundtracks 1&quot;. Though it was often reported as an industrial rock album, in 2001 Rose said: &quot;It is not industrial ... There will be all kinds of styles, many influences as blues, mixed in the songs.&quot;

Rose said in 1999 that the band had recorded enough material for at least two albums, including the potential for an album more industrial and electronic than &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. Sources said the band&#x27;s initial plans were to record two albums, release &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, tour for a year or two, and release the second album without having to return to the studio.
In November 1999, Guns N&#x27; Roses released their first new track in five years and the first original song in eight years, the industrial metal song &quot;Oh My God&quot;, featured in the film &quot;End of Days&quot; and released on the soundtrack. The song features Rose, Tobias, Stinson, Reed, Pitman, Finck, and Freese, along with guitarists Dave Navarro (of Jane&#x27;s Addiction) and Gary Sunshine. &quot;Oh My God&quot; received mixed reviews; AllMusic described it as &quot;a less than satisfying comeback&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; suggested the release was a stopgap to pacify fans and offset the mounting recording costs. Beavan, who produced the track, said it was included on the soundtrack at the request of Jimmy Iovine, the head of Geffen, who had picked it for the film after listening to several work-in-progress songs. Rose, Iovine, and several studio technicians stayed up all night adjusting the final mix before it was due. Rose later considered the track an unfinished demo due to the timing of the release.

=== Lineup changes, Beavan exits, and Roy Thomas Baker joins ===
While work was being finished on &quot;Oh My God&quot;, Finck left to rejoin Nine Inch Nails. In January 2000, Goldstein said &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was &quot;99% done&quot; and was set for release in mid-2000. In a February 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Rose said it had been delayed partially because he was learning how to use new recording technology: &quot;It&#x27;s like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer.&quot; The band moved their base of operations to Village Recorders around this time.

In March 2000, Rose hired the guitarist Buckethead to replace Finck. According to &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Buckethead&#x27;s eccentric stage persona – he wore a blank white mask and a KFC bucket on his head – made him the &quot;negative image of top-hatted, easygoing Slash&quot;, and rumors spread that Buckethead was Slash in disguise. At the end of his three-year contract, Josh Freese left to join A Perfect Circle, a band recently formed by Billy Howerdel, who had left the project several months earlier. Freese was frustrated with the lack of tours, likening the band to &quot;a giant jumbo jet sat on the tarmac waiting to take off&quot;. At the recommendation of Buckethead, Brain was brought in as drummer.

In early 2000, Beavan left the project. At this time the album was nearly complete, but after Rose hired Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker to replace Beavan, he was persuaded to do re-recording work on the entire album. Baker felt Freese&#x27;s drums needed to be rerecorded, as they sounded too &quot;industrial&quot;; Brain said they sounded digital, with &quot;not a lot of air moving&quot;. Rose felt that the finished album should reflect the &quot;energy&quot; of those who worked on it, and so felt Freese&#x27;s drums should be replaced. Geffen employee Tom Zutaut said that Freese&#x27;s drumming was &quot;spectacular&quot;. He said: &quot;I would not have wanted to be in Brain&#x27;s shoes. Basically we were saying to [Brain] &#x27;We have got a brilliant performance of this and now we need you to recreate it&#x27;.&quot;

Rose had Brain learn Freese&#x27;s parts note by note; Brain had the parts transcribed, then played them from a teleprompter before trying the songs again in his style. According to Brain, he recorded his parts in eight months and the final album features a hybrid of his and Freese&#x27;s styles. Bassist Tommy Stinson said he had to rerecord his bass parts with each change in drummer: &quot;I probably ended up completely re-recording each part five or six times over the years.&quot; Stinson was later critical of the rerecording process, saying that Baker &quot;wasted many years and many millions of dollars trying to get us better sounds that we could have addressed in the mixing stage&quot;.

At the end of Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Fragility Tour in July 2000, Finck rejoined the band. Rose had previously threatened to remove Finck&#x27;s parts from the album after seeing Finck perform with Nine Inch Nails at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards.

Composers Marco Beltrami and Paul Buckmaster worked on orchestral arrangements. In 2003, Beltrami said of the experience: &quot;I met with Axl and he played me these songs, asked me my ideas about them... I actually wrote some melodies and stuff. The music was eclectic and at the time that I was doing it there were no lyrics on the songs that I was working on.&quot;

Rose said a large inspiration in his writing was &quot;a final offering-up of his side&quot; of conflicts between former bandmates and ex-fiance Seymour, he hopes that her son Dylan (whom Rose was very close to) will eventually hear the album: &quot;I hope he&#x27;ll hear it when he grows up, if he ever wants to know the story, to hear the truth&quot;.

=== Tom Zutaut joins ===
In February 2001, Jimmy Iovine, the head of Geffen Records, asked Tom Zutaut, whom the label had fired two years previously, to help Guns N&#x27; Roses complete &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. Zutaut was the A&amp;R man who had discovered the band and guided them through the recording of their previous albums. After they had resolved some personal differences, Rose told Zutaut of his frustrations in finding the sounds he wanted; for example, he had instructed the production team to recreate the drum sound of Nirvana&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot; but was not satisfied with the results. With Zutaut&#x27;s intervention, the team recreated the sound to Rose&#x27;s satisfaction. After having Zutaut approved by Rose&#x27;s personal psychic, whom Rose believed could assess auras from photographs, Rose arranged for Geffen to pay Zutaut &quot;whatever it takes&quot;. Zutaut&#x27;s only concession was to defer some of his payment until the album was delivered, but the album missed the deadline.

Zutaut said Guns N&#x27; Roses had 50 to 60 songs in development during this period. By this point, Buckethead had left, following disagreements with Baker and frustrations over the lack of progress. Zutaut persuaded him to rejoin by installing a giant chicken coop in the studio for him to work in, with furniture, straw, chicken wire, and rubber chicken parts. Zutaut described it as &quot;part chicken coop, part horror movie ... You could almost smell the chickens.&quot; Only assistant engineers were allowed to enter, to adjust microphones. Rose&#x27;s assistant Beta Lebeis downplayed the coop as inexpensive and fun, saying, &quot;It didn&#x27;t cost money or anything – think about it, it&#x27;s just wire ... It&#x27;s something you do in three or four hours. Just for fun, to play a joke on somebody.&quot; However, according to Zutaut, the coop caused friction when Buckethead began using it to watch hardcore pornography, disturbing Rose. Zutaut told an interviewer that, after one of Rose&#x27;s dogs defecated in the coop, Buckethead insisted it not be cleaned up as he liked the smell. After three days, the smell had become overwhelming and the studio staff removed it, upsetting Buckethead.

At Interscope&#x27;s request, Zutaut investigated the project&#x27;s budget. He found that the band was spending thousands of dollars a month on rented gear that went unused, and he made changes that he estimated saved around $75,000 a month. Additionally, Rose kept erratic hours, which meant that the salaried musicians, engineers, and assistants were often unable to work. Zutaut said: &quot;These fucking people are getting paid shitloads of money and they&#x27;re sitting on their arse doing nothing because Axl&#x27;s not coming to the studio and they can&#x27;t get him on the phone.&quot;

Zutaut tried to convince Rose to release &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; as a solo album, feeling it would sell better. However, Rose said in 2008: &quot;I didn&#x27;t make a solo record. A solo record would be completely different than this and probably much more instrumental. The songs were chosen by everyone involved.&quot; Lebeis said in March 2001 that 48 songs had been completed and that Geffen had begun selecting them for the album. Zutaut estimated that Guns N&#x27; Roses had 50 or 60 songs in development. He went through each with Rose, trying to decide which were worth finishing. According to Zutaut, during his time with the band, they completed versions of &quot;The Blues&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.

====Zutaut and Baker exit====
For his 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, the filmmaker Ridley Scott asked to use the 1987 Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; from their debut album &quot;Appetite for Destruction.&quot; According to Zutaut, Rose already had new band members rerecord the entirety of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; as part of their induction, and so a day was spent mixing one of these versions. Rose attended a screening of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; arranged by Zutaut and fired him when he realized it was not a private screening. Zutaut said he was &quot;set up&quot;, which Rose disputed. According to Zutaut, by this time, around 11 or 12 tracks were complete but for final mixes, the album could have been complete by September 2002. Baker left the project a few months later.

=== Tour ===

On January 1, 2001, Guns N&#x27; Roses played at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, Nevada, their first concert in over seven years. This was followed by their headlining performance at Rock in Rio III on January 14, 2001, to an audience of 190,000 people. On August 29, 2002, they made a surprise visit to the MTV Video Music Awards in New York; their set included one new song, &quot;Madagascar&quot;. The Chinese Democracy Tour was met with mixed reviews in 2002, as no-shows in Vancouver and Philadelphia led to riots and the tour&#x27;s cancellation.

Guitarist Richard Fortus joined in 2002; he said all but his contribution, the chorus to &quot;Better&quot;, had been written by the time he joined, and that some riffs on the final album date back to Slash&#x27;s time in the band. The band had considered The Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford for the role, but Ford turned it down. In August 2002, Rose wrote on the Guns N&#x27; Roses website: &quot;We feel that we have clarity as to the album we&#x27;re trying to make, we&#x27;re wrapping it up. We&#x27;ve sorted it down to what songs are on the record, what the sequence of the songs is. The album art is ready.&quot; However, he told MTV News a few weeks later: &quot;You&#x27;ll see [the album], but I don&#x27;t know if &#x27;soon&#x27; is the word&quot;. Reed said in November 2002 that the album would be released by June 2003 and that there were only &quot;a few odds and ends left to do, a couple of finishing touches, a couple of vocals – and we need to mix it&quot;. Rose also confirmed plans for multiple albums and said the delay was partly due to a lack of support from Geffen for older bands, saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve had to do way more jobs in it than I&#x27;m supposed to. I&#x27;ve had to be manager, A&amp;R man, producer, sole lyric writer, and a lot of other things.&quot;

In 2003, radio DJ Eddie Trunk played a demo of &quot;I.R.S.&quot; leaked to him by New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza. He likened it to &quot;&quot;Use Your Illusion&quot;-era stuff, with some modern flairs to it&quot;, with a loop track leading to &quot;that same dramatic Guns N&#x27; Roses hard rock&quot;. The same year, the Offspring jokingly released a press release saying their next album would be called &quot;Chinese Democracy (You Snooze, You Lose)&quot; about the album&#x27;s protracted development. In response, Rose sent the Offspring a cease-and-desist order, to which the Offspring singer, Dexter Holland, responded: &quot;I think it got blown up a little more than we intended it to.&quot;

In mid-2003, Guns N&#x27; Roses reportedly started rerecording &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; again. A music journalist said Rose told him in June 2003 that &quot;he wants to make sure it is a perfect as possible before it is released&quot;. In 2004, Stinson said &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was &quot;almost done&quot; and had been delayed by legal problems and because Rose wanted to ensure every band member had a say in each song: &quot;It&#x27;s a lengthy process because you have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes.&quot; He also said Rose was a perfectionist. An engineer working on the album said: &quot;Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It&#x27;s an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they&#x27;ve done.&quot; Stinson later said:
=== Conflict with Geffen ===
By 2004, Geffen had removed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; from its release schedule and withdrawn funding, stating: &quot;Having exceeded all budgeted and approved recording costs by millions of dollars, it is Mr. Rose&#x27;s obligation to fund and complete the album, not Geffen&#x27;s.&quot; Around that time, manager Merck Mercuriadis said the album was close to complete. According to a March 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, production costs for the album had reached $13 million ($ in current dollar terms), making it probably the most expensive recording &quot;never made&quot;. Mercuriadis dismissed the article, writing in a letter that the newspaper&#x27;s sources had not been involved with the project for several years. At one point, the band was using a budget of almost $250,000 a month. Rose said the expense would be negated by the recording sessions yielding multiple albums.

==== Buckethead exits and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; ====
On March 17, 2004, Buckethead quit and Guns N&#x27; Roses canceled their planned resumption of the tour. They released a statement saying that Buckethead had been &quot;inconsistent and erratic in both his behavior and his commitment... His transient lifestyle has made it near impossible to have nearly any form of communications with him whatsoever.&quot; Rose then released a statement saying that they hoped &quot;to announce a release date within the next few months&quot;. Stinson said in September that the album would be in the mastering stages by November 2004.

Later that week, Geffen released Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; since Rose had failed to deliver an album.

===Tour resumes, more lineup changes===
Buckethead was replaced by Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal and touring resumed in May 2006. According to Bumblefoot around this time, the album was &quot;pretty far along. Everything was written, and a lot of things were recorded...there were still more guitar tracks to be done... [the album was roughly] eighty to eighty-five percent [complete].&quot; Bumblefoot added guitar to the album between tour legs throughout the year. Bumblefoot wrote guitar parts for every song, tried hundreds of ideas, and contributed fretless guitar. Bumblefoot said that working with such densely layered songs was a challenge, &quot;..you go into a higher range, so you don&#x27;t clash with it, and then it&#x27;s, like, &#x27;Oh, wait. There&#x27;s that synth thing...&#x27; Or you go lower, and it&#x27;s, like, &#x27;Ah, it&#x27;s kind of getting eaten up by the rhythms and the bass&#x27;, so it was a challenge to find the right place.&quot; For adding his contributions to the album, he said &quot;I&#x27;d spend 14 hours each day hearing songs for the first time, and would experiment with different ideas and directions – fretless, fretted, wah, clean, heavy, bluesy, melody, rhythmic, technical. I wrote my own parts, never copied or re-played anyone else&#x27;s, we&#x27;d mute other tracks and I&#x27;d create my own parts. 100 tracks for a song, with two people yelling opposite directions in my ear at the same time. In the end [producer] Caram [Costanzo] and Axl would decide want they feel was best for the songs.&quot;

Brain left the band in July 2006 to help take care of his newborn daughter. Frank Ferrer was brought in to replace Brain and added new drum tracks. Ferrer said: &quot;I did a few tracks with Brain and he told me to just make the songs my own. It wasn&#x27;t so much conscious writing as focusing on how the music made me feel and not overthinking it.&quot; According to Ferrer, he is the only drummer on the title track; the rest of the album features drums by Brain and Ferrer, using Freese&#x27;s arrangements. Ferrer plays on five tracks on the album.

Rose held listening parties in several New York bars in 2006, showcasing ten new songs. In October 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album had a &quot;firm&quot; release date of November 21, 2006. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, engineer Andy Wallace, who had worked with Nirvana, Sepultura, Slayer, and Bad Religion, was working on the album that year. Stinson said that most of the album had been recorded collaboratively in 2001, and had been &quot;pretty much done&quot; since then. Dizzy Reed attributed the album&#x27;s delay to a lack of &quot;deadline or [...] pressure&quot; in a 2006 interview.

On December 14, on the Guns N&#x27; Roses website, Rose announced the cancellation of four shows, citing the need for more time to work on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. He also announced that the band had ended their relationship with Mercuriadis, and announced a tentative release date of March 6, 2007; it was the first time the band had publicly given a release date. In an interview held during the launch party for Korn&#x27;s 2006 tour, Rose told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was a &quot;complex record&quot;, with Queen-like arrangements, and that he expected some fans to complain about the new direction. In a 2006 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach described &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; as &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;mind-blowing&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a very cool album—it&#x27;s badass with killer screams, killer guitar riffs, but it&#x27;s got a totally modern sound. The word for it is &#x27;grand.&#x27; It&#x27;s fucking epic. [Axl has] reinvented himself yet again.&quot; Bach also described the album as having &quot;the rawness and the power of &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, but it also has the grandiosity of &#x27;November Rain&#x27;.&quot;

Rose said in 2006 that Guns N&#x27; Roses had 32 songs in development, with Bach later confirming that Rose told him &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; would be the first in a trilogy of albums. Rose later in 2008 confirmed the working titles of 10 songs from the upcoming unreleased albums. (see § Unused tracks and follow-up album)

=== Final sessions ===
Rose recorded the final vocal tracks in January 2007. On February 22, 2007, the band&#x27;s road manager Del James issued a press release stating there was no official release date but that recording had ended and mixing had begun. In a 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach said Rose had planned to have the album released by Christmas 2007 and that the delays might have been caused by business problems. In January 2007, Bach recorded backing vocals for &quot;Sorry&quot; at Electric Lady Studios. He described the song as &quot;almost like doom metal with Axl singing really clean over this grinding, slow beat that is fucking mean, I cannot get it out of my head.&quot; Harpist Patti Hood, who had worked with Pitman on the album &quot;Free Mars&quot;, and conductor Suzy Katayama also recorded parts.

In January 2008, rumors arose that &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; had been handed to Geffen but was delayed because the label and Rose could not agree on the marketing. Radio host Eddie Trunk said Geffen might have the album and that delays were due to financial reasons. However, in a February 2008 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, Rose&#x27;s manager Beta Lebeis dismissed Trunk&#x27;s suggestion and said they were in negotiations with the label. With a wealth of material to select from, Rose was solely responsible for track selection and sequencing of the album. Stinson said that Jimmy Iovine &quot;pulled the record out of Axl&#x27;s hand at the fucking 11:30th hour&quot; saying &quot;He was this close to being able to sign off on that fucking thing, and they pulled it just before he was completely ready to be going &#x27;I&#x27;m done with it&#x27;, it was just a little too quick on that.&quot;

According to Bumblefoot, the band and producer Caram Costanzo (who joined in 2003) spent 14 hours a day working on the album. Producers who worked on the album included Bob Ezrin, Eric Caudieux, Sean Beavan, and Tim Palmer. Rose and Caram Costanzo are the producers credited on the finished album, with Baker, Caudieux, Beavan, and Pitman credited with additional production. The band used 15 studios during production, including Capitol Studios, Cherokee Studios, Electric Lady Studios, Sunset Sound Recorders, and The Village.

Mastering engineer Bob Ludwig offered three versions of the album for approval. Rose and Costanzo selected the version without dynamic range compression to avoid being involved in the ongoing loudness war. Ludwig wrote: &quot;I was floored when I heard they decided to go with my full dynamics version and the loudness-for-loudness-sake versions be damned ... The fan and press backlash against the recent heavily compressed recordings finally set the context for someone to take a stand and return to putting music and dynamics above sheer level.&quot;

On September 14, 2008, the track &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was included in the music game &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;, the first official release of new Guns N&#x27; Roses material since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Oh My God&quot;. It was followed by &quot;If the World&quot;, which plays during the closing credits of the 2008 film &quot;Body of Lies&quot;.

On October 9, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced November 23, 2008, as the firm release date for &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;. In the US, the retail release was sold exclusively through Best Buy. The first single, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, was released on October 22, 2008. It was debuted on the Opie and Anthony show broadcast by KROQ-FM. Ad spots referencing the then-upcoming 2008 United States presidential election began airing in early November. &quot;Better&quot; was released as a promo single on November 17, 2008, followed by &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; in March 2009.

Several days before its release, the band streamed the album on their Myspace page. It was streamed over 3 million times, breaking the Myspace record for the most streamed album ever. Band managers Irving Azoff and Andy Gould wrote in early November: &quot;The release of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; marks a historic moment in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. We&#x27;re launching with a monumental campaign... that matches the groundbreaking sound of the album itself.&quot;

The band announced a new leg of the Chinese Democracy Tour in March 2009, which lasted from December 2009 until December 2012. Finck left before the tour to rejoin Nine Inch Nails; he was replaced by DJ Ashba. A guitar tab book of the album was released in December 2009.

&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was banned in China because of perceived criticism in its title track of the Chinese government and a reference to Falun Gong. The Chinese Communist Party said through media that it &quot;turns its spear point on China&quot;.

===Disputes with label and management===
After the album&#x27;s release, Rose did not appear in public for several months and did not respond to calls from label Geffen to promote the album. On December 12, Rose answered questions and posted statements regarding the record, former bandmates, and tour plans on several Guns N&#x27; Roses fan forums. On February 9, 2009, in his first official interview since the release, Rose said he had &quot;no information for me to believe there was any real involvement or effort from Interscope&quot;. In a 2018 look back, &quot;Billboard&quot; decried the marketing for the album, stating: &quot;The most anticipated rock record in history was murdered by a thousand different jabs and body shots, including artwork the artist wasn&#x27;t committed to, but the colossal marketing blunder was the Tyson-esque knockout punch.&quot;

In May 2010, Azoff&#x27;s company Front Line Management sued Rose over unpaid concert fees. Rose filed a $5 million countersuit against Azoff claiming Azoff had &quot;sabotaged&quot; the &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; release by &quot;purposefully spoiling&quot; the album art, &quot;botching&quot; a sales deal with Best Buy, and leaking songs online. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese said in a 2024 interview that the band&#x27;s management told him executives planned for the album to fail to force Axl to reunite with Slash. The lawsuit was settled in 2011.

=== Leaks ===
In February 2006, &quot;I.R.S.&quot;, &quot;The Blues&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &quot;Better&quot; and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; leaked online. The leaked version of &quot;I.R.S.&quot; was aired frequently enough on various radio stations before the band&#x27;s management intervened that it charted at #49 on the Radio &amp; Records Active Rock National Airplay Chart for the week ending Feb. 24, 2006. In October, &quot;Better&quot; was inadvertently leaked by Harley-Davidson in an online ad. A &quot;final version&quot; was leaked in February 2007. &quot;Madagascar&quot; was leaked in March 2007. In May 2007, the title track leaked, and updated versions of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, &quot;The Blues&quot;, &quot;I.R.S.&quot; and &quot;There Was a Time&quot; were leaked by professional wrestler Mister Saint Laurent. The final version of &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; leaked in August 2008.

By the time &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was released, only 3 of the 14 songs had not been leaked or played live. In June 2008, five months before the album&#x27;s release, music blogger Kevin Cogill streamed nine tracks on his website Antiquiet for &quot;an hour or two&quot;. The high volume of traffic crashed the website server and the tracks were removed. In August, the FBI arrested Cogill under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act for releasing copyrighted material. Slash said: &quot;I hope he rots in jail. It&#x27;s going to affect the sales of the record, and it&#x27;s not fair.&quot; According to Techdirt, Cogill&#x27;s arrest resulted in a large boost in illegal downloads of the album. They also revealed that UMG showed Best Buy search engine traffic results shortly after the case to capitalize on the interest and help them with the distribution deal.

In November, Cogill agreed to plead guilty to one federal count of copyright infringement, later reduced to a misdemeanor. According to Cogill, he was not charged with copyright infringement because the court could not prove that the album was being prepared for commercial distribution: &quot;The US government would have to prove, in court, that &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was really coming. And no one at the RIAA or the label had informed the government that these songs had been lying around for 14 years. Only that they had cost $12 million.&quot; Cogill was sentenced to two months&#x27; house arrest and was required to produce an anti-piracy video with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). He said the video was never made as the RIAA did not want to spend money on production costs.

In 2019, around 120 &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; demos leaked online. Zutaut had allowed a storage unit containing several CDs of recordings to expire, its contents were auctioned off, and the winner sold them to a fan, who circulated them online. The &quot;Locker Leaks&quot; contained 19 discs of demos, mostly instrumentals, from around 2001–2002.

===Dr Pepper promotion===
On March 26, 2008, media reported that soft drinks manufacturer Dr Pepper would offer a free can of its product to everyone in America—excluding former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarists Buckethead and Slash—if the band released &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; in 2008. On the Guns N&#x27; Roses website, Rose wrote of his surprise at the company&#x27;s support and said he would share his Dr Pepper with Buckethead.

After it was announced that the album would be released in 2008, Dr Pepper confirmed that it would uphold its pledge. However, on the album&#x27;s release, the Dr Pepper website servers crashed under the demand for coupons. Lawyers for the band threatened Dr Pepper&#x27;s parent company with a lawsuit two days after the album&#x27;s release; in a letter to the company, Rose&#x27;s lawyer Alan Gutman said: &quot;The redemption scheme your company clumsily implemented for this offer was an unmitigated disaster which defrauded consumers and, in the eyes of vocal fans, ruined &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;″s release.&quot; Gutman also demanded a full-page apology to appear in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Later, in an online interview with fans, Rose said he told his lawyers it was a &quot;non-issue&quot; and was surprised by their actions, and that he believed they should have focused on the record release.

=== Copyright infringement ===
In October 2009, electronic musician Ulrich Schnauss&#x27;s record labels Independiente and Domino sued Guns N&#x27; Roses, alleging they had infringed copyright by using portions of Schnauss&#x27; compositions in the song &quot;Riad N&#x27; the Bedouins&quot;. The suit alleges the portions are sampled from Schnauss&#x27; &quot;Wherever You Are&quot; (2001) and &quot;A Strangely Isolated Place&quot; (2003). Brian Caplan, attorney for Domino, said they first contacted Geffen on February 26. Caplan told &quot;New York Daily News&quot; the label &quot;attempted to explain [the samples] away&quot;, and &quot;They tried to justify it&quot;.

Guns N&#x27; Roses denied the allegations. Their manager, Irving Azoff, said: &quot;The snippets of &#x27;ambient noise&#x27; in question were provided by a member of the album&#x27;s production team who has assured us that these few seconds of sound were obtained legitimately ... While the band resents the implication that they would ever use another artist&#x27;s work improperly and are assessing possible counterclaims, they are confident this situation will be satisfactorily resolved.&quot; The two labels sought $1 million in damages against Geffen for the unauthorized use of the samples.

===Unused tracks and follow-up album===

According to Bumblefoot, one song, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, was cut at the last second because of CD playing time constraints. Songs mentioned by those involved in the recording that did not make the final album include &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;Thyme&quot;, &quot;The General&quot;, &quot;Elvis Presley and the Monster of Soul&quot;, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, &quot;Ides of March&quot;, &quot;Silkworms&quot;, &quot;Down by the Ocean&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, &quot;Quick Song&quot; and &quot;We Were Lying&quot;.
In August 2013, &quot;Going Down&quot;, a song recorded during the sessions featuring Stinson on vocals, was leaked online, as well as several remixes by Brain and future Guns N&#x27; Roses keyboardist Melissa Reese. In 2014, Rose said that a &quot;second part&quot; of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; and a remix album were complete and pending release. In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that a follow-up to &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; had been planned for 2016, but was put on hold when Slash and Duff McKagan rejoined the band. Guitarist Richard Fortus confirmed work on a new album in 2018. In October 2021, Slash mentioned the band had been reworking songs from the &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; period. In 2021, starting with &quot;Absurd&quot;, the band started occasionally releasing reworked singles.

==Style and composition==

&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; marked Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; expansion into industrial rock, electronic rock nu metal, and elements of trip-hop while retaining the hard rock style of previous albums. Critics noted stylistic similarities on the album to the work of Queen, Paul McCartney and Wings, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Rose cited the influence of Dave Grohl&#x27;s drumming on Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; on the title track. The song was inspired by the movie &quot;Kundun&quot; about the Dalai Lama, as well as the three months Rose spent living in China, stating &quot;When you stay in hotels there, you don&#x27;t realize that the stuff you&#x27;re seeing on TV, the average person isn&#x27;t seeing. Everywhere I went, people are scared, they&#x27;re frightened for their lives to have an opinion that deviates from the government about the simplest things, things that we take for granted.&quot; The lyrics &quot;Blame it on the Falun Gong / They&#x27;ve seen the end and you cannot hold on now&quot; from the song caused the album to be banned in China. The song starts with a delayed intro of ambient noise and guitar lines. &quot;Spin&quot; likened the guitars to the work of Tom Morello. Drummer Josh Freese wrote the main guitar riff, describing it as &quot;really dumb, simple, dirty guitar riff.&quot;

&quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was written in reaction to &quot;the insanity of senseless school shootings and also the media trying desperately to make more out of one shooter&#x27;s preference for the Guns song Brownstone to no avail&quot; according to Rose. Rose also compared the song&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;a horror flick or something like Dexter.. with an interesting menacing character.&quot; The song drew comparisons to the music of industrial and electronic artists such as Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, Marilyn Manson, Korn, and Rob Zombie from critics. The song features elements of industrial rock, electronic rock, nu metal, sludge rock, and alternative rock. Multiple layers of vocals create what &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described as &quot;a demented choir&quot;. &quot;Better&quot; is an electronic rock-influenced song that features Rose singing in falsetto at the beginning of the track &quot;No one ever told me when / I was alone / They just thought I&#x27;d know better&quot;, over a &quot;whining guitar line that bubbles and bursts&quot;. Rose mentioned the guitar parts in the bridge as among his favorite parts of the album. &quot;Loudwire&quot; described the song as having an Acid house-style beat, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the intro as a &quot;hip-hop voicemail&quot;. &quot;Apple Music&quot; compared the vocals to the &quot;gothic thrust of Iron Maiden&#x27;s Bruce Dickinson&quot;.

&quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, previously known as &quot;The Blues&quot;, is a pop-influenced piano ballad similar to &quot;November Rain&quot; and &quot;The Garden&quot; with influences from Elton John. The song was noted as similar to the works of Queen. On &quot;If The World&quot;, Buckethead played a flamenco guitar; it was described as having &quot;an electronic funk slither&quot;, neo-soul, nu-metal, and trip-hop styles. Keyboardist Chris Pitman said the song was &quot;about environmental decay in its futurist context&quot;. Pitman primarily wrote the song on a 12-string guitar, stating &quot;I just started with this riff that allows for a pretty cool vocals... I wrote the drums with a dub / reggae beat... added strings, piano, bass, echo guitar, synth and sub-bass. I gave the recordings to Axl and he added his part by singing in one night.&quot; Rose described the writing of the song as a combination of James Bond and &#x27;70s Blaxploitation films, with an &quot;intentionally cheesy sounding chorus&quot; to parody James Bond music.

&quot;There Was a Time&quot; is a heavily layered melody-driven orchestral song with a Mellotron, violins, choirs, and multiple synthesizers. &quot;Spin&quot; noted, &quot;Bluesy piano and slyly cinematic passage set up the highest notes Axl&#x27;s full-health throat has ever belted.&quot; &quot;Apple Music&quot; described the song as featuring &quot;prog rock mellotron and strings&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; said the song was &quot;a mesmerizing cocktail of minimalist hip-hop beats, lush string arrangements, transcendent guitar solos and some of Rose&#x27;s most ear-piercing, tortured screams—sometimes happening all at once.&quot; &quot;Kerrang&quot; noted influences from Danny Elfman, The Eagles, and Carlos Santana on the track. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; was written after Rose watched a documentary on Mark David Chapman and wanted to write a song in dedication to John Lennon; the song is meant to criticize the book &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The song, a power ballad, drew comparisons to Oasis as well as Elton John, Queen, and the Guns N&#x27; Roses song &quot;Yesterdays&quot;. &quot;Scraped&quot; takes the album back to an industrial rock style with Rose singing &quot;Don&#x27;t you try to stop us now&quot; and &quot;All things are possible, I am unstoppable.&quot; The intro has been described as &quot;highly processed and strange&quot;. A vocal bridge on the song was noted as similar to &quot;Get the Funk Out&quot; by Extreme. It also drew comparisons to Soundgarden. &quot;Loudwire&quot; described the song as a &quot;musical Frankenstein&quot;, referencing the effects on Rose&#x27;s voice.

Discussing the origins of &quot;Riad N&#x27; The Bedouins&quot;, Rose said: &quot;Riad is the name my one-time momentary brother-in-law of Erin Everly went by when I knew him. Of part Lebanese descent and a former student of Pepperdine University, he claims to be an international arms dealer.&quot; Rose&#x27;s vocals on the song have been compared to Robert Plant. The song starts with ambient samples of the songs &quot;Wherever You Are&quot; and &quot;A Strangely Isolated Place&quot; by Ulrich Schnauss (see § Copyright infringement for information on the lawsuit regarding the samples). Several critics have theorized the song&#x27;s lyrical content is about the Iraq War. Rose said &quot;Sorry&quot; was about &quot;anyone talking nonsense at mine and the public&#x27;s expense&quot;. The song is a power ballad that features a chorus &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for you/Not sorry for me&quot;, described as a shot at Rose&#x27;s former bandmates. The song drew comparisons to Pink Floyd and Metallica, and Rose&#x27;s vocals were compared to Layne Staley. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; noted Rose&#x27;s &quot;bizarre, quasi-Transylvanian accent&quot; on the line &quot;But I don&#x27;t want to do it&quot;. &quot;I.R.S.&quot; has Rose singing &quot;Gonna call the president / Gonna call myself a private eye / Gonna need the IRS / Gonna get the FBI&quot; over a guitar-heavy track. The song was also noted for trip-hop influences. &quot;Spin&quot; mentioned the main riff&#x27;s similarities to that of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;In Bloom&quot;.

&quot;Madagascar&quot; has been described as having a &quot;trip-hop pulse&quot;; its bridge features interwoven samples of quotations from the movies &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, &quot;Casualties of War&quot;, &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;, &quot;Braveheart&quot;, and &quot;Seven&quot;, and also contains several excerpts from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s speeches &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; and &quot;Why Jesus Called a Man a Fool&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; described it as &quot;Axl&#x27;s attempt to do Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Kashmir&quot;. Rose said of the quotes &quot;Dr. King&#x27;s words have been edited together from multiple speeches as to bring the sentiments of his messages into the context of this particular song and to present their importance as strongly as possible.&quot; &quot;This I Love&quot; is a song written in 1992 that Rose called &quot;the heaviest thing I&#x27;ve written&quot;. The song is a piano ballad with Rose singing to a former lover. Rose described the song stating &quot;It&#x27;s a lot more intricate than I think most realize yet as the guitar and vocals are placed as they should be so dominant. The main string melody in that section I had originally written to a hip-hop loop as well.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; compared the song to the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber. &quot;Prostitute&quot; is another orchestral-lined power ballad that features the lyrics &quot;Ask yourself / Why I would choose / To prostitute myself / To live with fortune and shame&quot;. According to producer Youth, Rose &quot;labored&quot; over the song because past successes weighed heavily on him. The song was described by &quot;Loudwire&quot; as &quot;blending classical orchestrations and electro-beats with blistering guitar solos and some of [Rose&#x27;s] highest pitched shrieking.&quot; &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; compared Rose&#x27;s vocals to &quot;Bruce Hornsby with distortion.&quot;

==Artwork==

The cover art features a sepia photograph of a bicycle with a large wicker basket resting against a wall on which the band&#x27;s name is graffitied; it was photographed in Kowloon Walled City by Terry Hardin. Three red communist stars are above the letters &quot;GNR&quot; on the side with the band name and album title, which are written vertically. According to artistic director Ryan Corey, Rose conceived the bike cover at the album&#x27;s inception.

Rose approached Chinese artist Chen Zhuo for permission to use a painting of Tiananmen Square as an amusement park for the album cover, but Chen declined due to China&#x27;s strict censorship laws and risks collaborating with a potentially controversial project. Shi Lifeng&#x27;s painting &quot;Controlling No. 3&quot; was chosen by Rose and used as an alternate cover for an &quot;art edition&quot;. It was used for the &quot;Rock Band 2&quot; download and released on CD in small quantities. The alternate booklet opens with a short essay written by Rose titled &quot;Fear N&#x27; Freedom: The Future of China and Western Society&quot;. The album booklet features several artworks by Shi, including a bloodied fist holding a star covered by flailing human figures. Photographs of the Hong Kong skyline and the Chinese military also appear in the booklet. The booklet also includes pictures of Rose, Buckethead, Stinson, Pitman, Finck, Fortus, Bumblefoot, Reed, Brain, and Ferrer alongside lyrics to the songs.

Rose said in December 2008 that two alternate booklets were pending release, adding &quot;The artwork has always been something I&#x27;ve been passionate about, and to release the album with unapproved and unseen final artwork with a 1st work only error-filled draft when others more recent were readily available still has not been explained.&quot; However, plans fell through and only the &quot;art edition&quot; was released in limited quantities. Stinson said executives &quot;ripped away&quot; from Rose the artwork &quot;right at the last second, when he wasn&#x27;t ready&quot;.

==Critical reception==
 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Ann Powers called it &quot;a test for contemporary ears&quot; and &quot;a cyborgian blend of pop expressiveness, traditional rock bravado and Brian Wilson-style beautiful weirdness&quot;. Chuck Klosterman, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, praised the vocals and guitar parts but criticized some production elements, saying &quot;Three of the songs are astonishing. Four or five others are very good. The vocals are brilliantly recorded, and the guitar playing is (generally) more interesting than the guitar playing on the &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums.&quot; Klosterman also commented that the album is &quot;the last Old media album... the last album that will be marketed as a collection of autonomous-but-connected songs... the last album that will matter more as a physical object than as an Internet sound file.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer David Fricke commended Rose&#x27;s unrestrained approach and called it &quot;a great, audacious, unhinged and uncompromising hard-rock record&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; later ranked the album number 12 on its year-end list of 2008&#x27;s best albums.
Jon Dolan from &quot;Blender&quot; found some of the music &quot;ludicrous&quot; and other parts &quot;brilliant&quot;, writing that &quot;these aren&#x27;t songs, they&#x27;re suites, energetic and skittering and unpredictable hard rock hydras cut with miasmic industrial grind, stadium rattling metal solos, electronic drift and hip-hop churn.&quot; Writing for &quot;MSN Music&quot;, Robert Christgau said Rose succeeds on &quot;his own totally irrelevant terms&quot; and added, &quot;Since he&#x27;s no longer capable of leading young white males astray, this effort isn&#x27;t just pleasurable artistically. It&#x27;s touching on a human level. Noble, even. I didn&#x27;t think he had it in him.&quot; CTV News compared the production to the Wall of Sound style of Phil Spector. &quot;People&quot;″s David Caplan said that &quot;everyone loves it&quot; and &quot;It is really great for Guns N&#x27; Roses fans because it&#x27;s pure Guns N&#x27; Roses.&quot;

In a mixed review, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Greg Kot found Rose&#x27;s production over-embellished, saying &quot;[the songs] sound like the work of a fading rock star with far too much money and time on his hands&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized the album as incohesive and &quot;exhausting&quot;, but praised Rose&#x27;s melodies. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; complimented the vocals but criticized the &quot;dated&quot; sound. &quot;Q&quot; considered the album overproduced, stating &quot;by throwing everything at the wall and nailing up the stuff that didn&#x27;t stick, [Rose has] done himself a grand disservice&quot;. Kitty Empire, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, accused Rose of &quot;cribbing&quot; from the industrial rock of Nine Inch Nails, calling the album &quot;a mish-mash of portentous digitals in search of a purpose.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer Jon Pareles described &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; as &quot;a transitional album&quot;, saying &quot;By holding it back and tinkering with it for so long, Mr. Rose has pressured himself to make it ... Sometime during the years of work, theatricality and razzle-dazzle replaced heart.&quot; Rock biographer Stephen Davis was more vitriolic and named &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; &quot;the worst album ever&quot;, saying &quot;It sounds like a Rob Zombie album from 1995&quot;.

The album was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year in 2009, losing to Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends&quot;. The song &quot;If the World&quot; was nominated for Best Original Song at the 13th Satellite Awards, losing to &quot;Another Way to Die&quot; by Jack White and Alicia Keys. The album was included on several publications&#x27; lists of the best and worst albums of the year.

Buckethead&#x27;s guitar solo on &quot;There Was a Time&quot; received acclaim. &quot;Consequence&quot; wrote it was one of the best solos of the decade, and &quot;Total Guitar&quot; editors ranked it as the 32nd best of the 21st century, while readers of that magazine ranked it 6th.

===Former band members&#x27; opinions===
Slash reacted positively to the title track: &quot;That sounds cool. It&#x27;s good to hear Axl&#x27;s voice again, y&#x27;know?&quot; Of the album, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s a really good record. It&#x27;s very different from what the original Guns N&#x27; Roses sounded like, but it&#x27;s a great statement by Axl ... It&#x27;s a record that the original Guns N&#x27; Roses could never possibly make. And at the same time it just shows you how brilliant Axl is.&quot; He later said the album was &quot;exactly what I thought it would sound like&quot;, with synthesizers and digital augmentations. After rejoining the band for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour in 2016, Slash complimented Buckethead&#x27;s guitar parts and spoke of the album in a 2018 interview: &quot;It is very different. It&#x27;s really cool stuff, but it was played by guitar players that are very different from me, style-wise... I also want to give credit where credit&#x27;s due—the guitar players that played on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;... are fucking amazing.&quot;

Izzy Stradlin said, &quot;I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them,&quot; and &quot;I like what I&#x27;ve heard.&quot; Duff McKagan said: &quot;I was glad to hear Axl&#x27;s voice, I&#x27;ve always been a fan of his voice. I&#x27;m not listening to it for it to sound like anything I was part of, because I know it&#x27;s not that. I think Axl sang his ass off. He made the record he wanted to make and I&#x27;m happy for him. I thought he did a great job.&quot; Matt Sorum said he was &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot; by the title track, and called the album a &quot;toe-tapper&quot;.

Gilby Clarke said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s a really good record—I honestly do... Knowing [the] direction [in which] he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job&quot;. Steven Adler, asked if he liked the album, said, &quot;Not one bit. I didn&#x27;t recognize Axl&#x27;s voice on it. There&#x27;s occasional parts where he does his loud scream but I didn&#x27;t even know it was him.&quot; He also criticized labeling the album as Guns N&#x27; Roses, stating it should have been released as an Axl Rose solo album. Founding Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Tracii Guns found it &quot;over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting&quot;.

===Accolades===

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;″s protracted recording process attracted extensive media coverage. According to &quot;Spin&quot;, a cottage industry grew around covering its development; &quot;the only way the record could have lived up to its legend would have been to never come out at all&quot;. Five years after its release, &quot;Grantland&quot; journalist Steven Hyden wrote: &quot;For years, it was widely assumed &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; would never come out; in retrospect, the delay is all anybody cares about ... As music, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; is merely the second-worst GNR record; as a figure of speech, it is shorthand for the grandest of boondoggles.&quot; Hyden wrote that the album had served as a lesson for acts who took years to release &quot;comeback&quot; albums, demonstrating the perils of allowing backstory to overshadow the work and failing to provide a familiar product. He compared &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; to subsequent, successful comeback albums by acts including Daft Punk, David Bowie, Justin Timberlake, and My Bloody Valentine, which were &quot;more modest&quot; and offered &quot;well-trod musical territory associated with each artist&quot;. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; noted the album&#x27;s reception, stating &quot;The fact that it was, by all standards, a fairly good album, was completely eclipsed by its backstory&quot; and stating that artists such as Bowie, Steve Perry, and Tool used the album as an example &quot;by keeping a low profile during production and staying relatively faithful to what fans expected&quot; for long-awaited albums. Multiple publications have used &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; as a noun when describing other long-delayed albums.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; saw the album as a &quot;loud last gasp from the reign of the indulged pop star&quot;; where Rose had once commanded &quot;loyal audiences, bountiful royalties, escalating ambitions and dangerously open-ended deadlines&quot;, the music business in the early 21st century had become &quot;leaner&quot; and &quot;leakier&quot;. Jim DeRogatis compared the album to the movie &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;, claiming it was a &quot;late-career installment in a beloved franchise that we never thought we&#x27;d see,&quot; but lamenting that it was &quot;nowhere near enough to stand as an equal artistic accomplishment.&quot;

In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; named &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; among the &quot;50 Albums That Were Unfairly Hated On&quot;, praising Roses&#x27;s vocals and the musicianship of the band and stating that the album&#x27;s biggest flaw was the delays in release. In a 2015 review inducting the album into their &quot;New Classic Albums&quot; category, Artistdirect praised the album, calling it &quot;a timeless work of art&quot;. In a 2018 look back, &quot;Billboard&quot; called the album a &quot;sonic anomaly&quot; of the time due to the mixing and lack of compression making it sound &quot;vintage or alien to rock music fans&quot;. A 2018 retrospective review by &quot;No Recess&quot; magazine compared the album to &quot;their own version of Danzig&#x27;s Blackacidevil&quot;, stating &quot;[After the &#x27;90s] the only thing left was to repeat or radically reinvent themselves. Chinese Democracy tries to do both, to varying degrees of &#x27;okay, sure&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Loudwire&quot;, although ranking the album second to last out of Guns N&#x27; Roses studio albums, wrote that there &quot;was a lot of expectation and backlash built up before release&quot; and highlighted &quot;Better&quot;, &quot;Madagascar&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Shackler&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; as standouts. &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album last, stating &quot;if you make your fans wait nearly two decades for a record, it&#x27;s probably going to have to be the best record ever made to impress anyone. &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; wasn&#x27;t that, but nor was it the worst thing ever either. Instead, it was what you might have expected—epic, overblown and full of noodling guitar solos.&quot;

In 2021, &quot;Ultimate Guitar&quot; called the album &quot;unfairly maligned&quot; while highlighting &quot;There Was a Time&quot; as the standout track. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; also highlighted &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, and wrote: &quot;At its best, Chinese Democracy recaptures the metallic thunder and epic grandeur of GN&#x27;R&#x27;s heyday.&quot; Journalist Gary Graff wrote &quot;its sprawling, indulgent insanity is maybe even more fun to hear now than it was at the time&quot; after re-listening to the album in 2021. In 2022, &quot;Loudwire&quot; placed the album on a list of &quot;10 Hated Rock + Metal Albums That Are Better Than You Remember&quot;, stating &quot;it may be a mess, but there are still some great jams here.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joseph Hudak referred to the album as &quot;criminally under-appreciated&quot; and listed &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; as the standout track in 2023.

When listing &quot;The 50 Worst Decisions in Music History&quot; in a 2022 article, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Andy Greene listed &quot;Guns N&#x27; Roses begin work on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;&quot; as 29th, saying &quot;Axl and a rotating crew of new gunners spent nearly 15 years laboring away at &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, burning untold millions of dollars and an incalculable amount of fan goodwill in the process... When it finally came out in 2008, few fans were still paying attention. A little patience is one thing. Nearly 20 years is something else.&quot; In 2024, Greene ranked the album 4th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 50 Most Disappointing Albums&quot; saying &quot;Despite a handful of strong songs [...] the album is ludicrously overcooked&quot;.

==Sales==

Best Buy purchased 1.3 million copies of &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; from UMG for $14 million ($ in current dollar terms) before release and pledged not to return unsold copies. The album was released on November 22, 2008, in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. It was released the following day worldwide, except for the United Kingdom, where it was released on November 24.

&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 261,000 copies in its first week, well below expectations. It debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart. Second-week US sales dropped significantly and it fell from #3 to #18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart: a 78% drop. The programming director at KLOS-FM said the low sales were due to the holiday season release and lackluster lead single, while Reuters blamed the Best Buy exclusive deal for lower-than-expected sales in the US. Critics also cited Rose&#x27;s lack of promotional appearances as a factor.

After selling 21,000 copies in its sixth week and charting at #30, &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; was certified Gold, passing the 500,000-shipped mark on January 7, 2009. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA on February 3, 2009, having shipped one million copies in the United States. It placed 55th on the 2009 Billboard 200 Year End charts.

&quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; won an IFPI European Platinum Award, having sold more than one million copies in Europe, and had sold 2.6 million units worldwide by February 2009, according to Universal Music. It reached triple platinum certification in Canada and was awarded platinum certifications in many countries including Finland, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. It was certified gold in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, the Netherlands, Sweden, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Brazil, and Colombia. After Best Buy put the album on clearance for $2 in April 2011, it re-entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the week ending April 3, 2011, at #198, selling 3,200 copies. By then, the album had sold 614,000 copies in the US, according to Nielsen Soundscan. In the UK, it had sold 365,899 copies by July 2014. After the 2016 Not in This Lifetime... Tour (during which most songs from the album were played), &quot;Billboard&quot; reported the album&#x27;s digital streams jumped from 8 million streams to 24 million, as well as 7,900 additional copies sold.

<text>Michael Sidney Luft (November 2, 1915 – September 15, 2005) was an American show business figure, the second husband of actress Lynn Bari, and later the third husband of actress and singer Judy Garland.

==Early life==
Luft was born in New York City, the son of Leonora (Meyers) and Norbert Luft, who were Jewish immigrants from Russia and Germany. His family moved to Westchester County, where he grew up.

==Career==

Luft was once an amateur boxer and bar-room brawler and had the nickname &quot;One-Punch Luft&quot;. He was a pilot in the Royal Canadian Air Force and in the early 1940s was a test pilot for Douglas Aircraft Company.

Luft&#x27;s first Hollywood assignment was as the secretary and manager of dancer Eleanor Powell. He is credited with keeping Judy Garland working and with setting up a deal with Warner Bros. to bankroll his wife&#x27;s comeback film, a 1954 musical remake of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; plus future projects. Luft&#x27;s name is on the film&#x27;s credits as producer. &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; was a major critical success. During its first release, the picture proved to be very popular with audiences and grossed an enormous amount of money, but it failed to recoup its production costs. This was considered a major factor in Garland not winning the Academy Award that year for Best Actress. As a result, the studio canceled the Luft–Garland contract.

==Personal life==
He was married five times:

*In December 1940 to aspiring actress MaryLou Simpson. They divorced in 1942.
* On November 28, 1943, to actress Lynn Bari. They had two children, a daughter who died shortly after birth and a son named John Michael Luft (born 1948). They divorced on December 26, 1950.
* On June 29, 1952, to singer and actress Judy Garland. They had two children, Lorna Luft (born November 21, 1952, in Santa Monica, California) and Joseph Wiley &quot;Joey&quot; Luft (born March 29, 1955, in Los Angeles). They separated in 1963 and divorced in 1965. Garland accused him of drunkenness, gambling indebtedness and abuse.
* In 1970, to Patti Hemingway (sometimes spelled Patty Hemingway). They divorced less than a year later.
* On March 20, 1993, to Camille Keaton.

==Death==
Sidney Luft died on September 15, 2005, in Santa Monica, California, apparently of a heart attack, at the age of 89.

==Filmography==
*1947: &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot;
*1948: &quot;French Leave&quot;
*1954: &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;
*1955: &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; (TV) (Episode: &quot;The Judy Garland Special&quot;)
*1956: &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; (TV) (Episode: &quot;Judy Garland Musical Special&quot;)
*1997: &quot;Judy Garland&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;

<doc id="967011" wikidata="Q7808163" url="?curid=967011" title="Tingley">
<text>Tingley is a suburban village in the City of Leeds in West Yorkshire, Northern England, forming part of the parish of West Ardsley. Tingley forms part of the Heavy Woollen District. It is situated between the cities of Leeds and Wakefield. 

Most of Tingley sits in the Ardsley and Robin Hood ward of Leeds City Council, whilst west Tingley forms part of Morley South ward. Both wards are part of the Leeds South West and Morley parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==
Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Tingley is situated between Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford but considered part of Morley. It has the WF3 (Wakefield) postcode area while the village telephone numbers are &quot;0113&quot;, the Leeds prefix.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tingley&quot; is first attested in the thirteenth century, and on through the Middle Ages, in forms such as &quot;Thing(e)law(e)&quot;, and &quot;Tinglawe&quot; in 1608. The name comes from Old English &quot;þing&quot; (&#x27;meeting, assembly&#x27;) and &quot;hlāw&quot; (&#x27;mound, hill, burial mound&#x27;). Thus it was probably the meeting place for Morley Wapentake.

Just to the north of Tingley, at the northern end of East and West Ardsley parish, lies Dunningley, whose name is first attested around 1200 in the forms &quot;Duninglau&quot; and &quot;Duninglaue&quot;. Like &quot;Tingley&quot; and &quot;Ardsley&quot;, this came comes from a personal name followed by Old English &quot;hlǣw&quot; (&#x27;hill, mound&#x27;). In this case the name was &quot;Dun&quot;, and was followed by the element &quot;-ing-&quot; which in this instance is an Old English suffix indicating the connection between the name-bearer and the landscape feature. Thus the name once meant &#x27;Dun&#x27;s hill&#x27; or &#x27;Dun&#x27;s (burial) mound&#x27;.

==Governance==
Tingley was part of the Ardsley Urban district 1894–1937, which also included West Ardsley and East Ardsley and was then part of Morley Municipal borough 1937–1974. The village once formed part of the former Municipal Borough of Morley, and is still classed as part of Morley in the census. However, it is technically separate, and is not governed by Morley Town Council.

Tingley is split into two Leeds City Council wards, Morley South and Ardsley and Robin Hood. Both elect three city councillors to the council. It is in the Morley and Outwood parliamentary constituency.

==Culture and community==
Until recently a semi-rural location, Tingley has seen much residential development over the last twenty-five years, while managing to keep most of its rural views, it is only five miles south of Leeds City Centre. Close by to the east along the A650 are West Ardsley and East Ardsley with Woodkirk to the south.

The coal and woollen industries which provided much employment in the area until well after World War II have now completely disappeared and Tingley is essentially a suburb. Within a five-mile radius of the settlement lie the city centres of Leeds and Wakefield and the town centres of Morley, Batley, Dewsbury and Ossett.

Tingley is home to Tingley Athletic JFC (junior football club). The club traditionally play in white and green stripes with black shorts and green socks, and have had a number of players go on to play at professional and semi-professional level. The club play at their home ground, &quot;The Crescent&quot;, this houses changing rooms, showers, two full-sized football pitches, a 3/4 sized football pitch, and 3 7 a-side football pitches.

Close by near the start of the A653 to Leeds City Centre is the main transmitter for Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire and the studios of Heart Yorkshire. 

Residents shopping needs are mainly covered by the nearby White Rose Centre only minutes away in Beeston. The Leeds branch of the Big Motoring World chain of used car hypermarkets is also in Tingley, along with the South Leeds arm of Village Hotels.

Tingley has had several public houses, including the former &quot;White Bear&quot;, which prior to demolition was prominently located next to Tingley roundabout. The former &quot;Bull&#x27;s Head&quot; (located at the crossroads of Dewsbury, Rein and Syke Road) and &quot;The Babes in the Wood&quot; off lower Dewsbury Road have both now also been closed. This leaves three local public houses, &quot;The British Oak&quot; off Westerton Road in Tingley, The New Scarborough on Dewsbury Road in Tingley and &quot;The Hare and Hounds&quot; off Heybeck Lane in West Ardsley. 

Tingley has several places of worship, including Tingley Methodist Church, on Westerton Road next to Westerton Academy, Hope Church, currently on Heatherdale Road, and West Ardsley Methodist Church, on Haigh Moor Road just off Batley Road. The former Tingley Zion Methodist Church closed in 1997.

==Education==
The immediate area is served by &quot;Westerton Primary Academy&quot; (formerly Westerton Primary School), &quot;Blackgates Primary School&quot; and Woodkirk Academy (formerly Woodkirk High School) whilst the wider local area includes &quot;Hill Top Academy&quot; in West Ardsley and The Morley Academy in nearby Morley.

==Transport==
Tingley is perhaps best known for its eponymous roundabout, at the junction of the M62 motorway and the A653 (&quot;Dewsbury Road&quot;) and the A650 (&quot;Bradford Road&quot;). Until major traffic light and lane works were undertaken in the early 2000s, this roundabout was known as one of the worst in the Leeds area for accidents.

Tingley was originally intended to be home to the southern terminus of the main line of the now shelved, Leeds Supertram project.

==Railway past==
Tingley was once served by its own railway station, which was located on the old now long closed ex-Great Northern railway line (Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway) that ran from Ardsley Junction to Laisterdyke (outskirts of Bradford) and opened to traffic in 1857. The station was also a junction station on the also now closed Batley to Beeston loop line in-between.

Tingley railway station closed to passengers in 1954, and later to freight in 1964, with the line itself closing to all rail traffic in May 1969.

The railway station has long been demolished, along with the Dewsbury Road bridge abutment (to the west of the station itself). The formerly adjacent Station Lane, which leads off Dewsbury Road, once led up to the station. Along the former ex-Great Northern loop line towards Beeston Junction lies the now long disused Tingley Viaduct. This historic structure once carried the long closed-down Batley-Beeston loop line (across the present day Leeds-Doncaster line) en route.

==Notable people==
In June 1980, Zigmund Adamski, a coal miner at Lofthouse Colliery approaching retirement, set off from Tingley to go shopping in Wakefield. He was never seen alive again. His body was found on top of a mound of coal near Todmorden. He had died of a heart attack. The police were unable to understand why and how he died. His death has been claimed to have the hallmarks of a UFO incident.

David Batty, who played for Leeds United and Newcastle United as well as England, is one of the most famous players to start off at Tingley Athletic.

<text>Early modern Britain is the history of the island of Great Britain roughly corresponding to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Major historical events in early modern British history include numerous wars, especially with France, along with the English Renaissance, the English Reformation and Scottish Reformation, the English Civil War, the Restoration of Charles II, the Glorious Revolution, the Treaty of Union, the Scottish Enlightenment and the formation and the collapse of the First British Empire.

== England during the Tudor period (1485–1603) ==
=== English Renaissance ===

The term, &quot;English Renaissance&quot; is used by many historians to refer to a cultural movement in England in the 16th and 17th centuries that was heavily influenced by the Italian Renaissance. This movement is characterised by the flowering of English music (particularly the English adoption and development of the madrigal), notable achievements in drama (by William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson), and the development of English epic poetry (most famously Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;).

The idea of the Renaissance has come under increased criticism by many cultural historians, and some have contended that the &quot;English Renaissance&quot; has no real tie with the artistic achievements and aims of the northern Italian artists (Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello) who are closely identified with the Renaissance. 

Other cultural historians have countered that, regardless of whether the name &quot;renaissance&quot; is apt, there was undeniably an artistic flowering in England under the House of Tudor, culminating in Shakespeare and his contemporaries. 

=== The rise of the Tudors ===
Some scholars date the beginning of Early Modern Britain to the end of the Wars of the Roses and the crowning of Henry Tudor in 1485 after his victory at the battle of Bosworth Field. Henry VII&#x27;s largely peaceful reign ended decades of civil war and brought the peace and stability to England needed for art and commerce to thrive. A major war on English soil would not occur again until the English Civil War of the 17th century. The Wars of the Roses claimed an estimated 105,000 dead.

During this period Henry VII and his son Henry VIII greatly increased the power of the English monarchy. A similar pattern was unfolding on the continent as new technologies, such as gunpowder, and social and ideological changes undermined the power of the feudal nobility and enhanced that of the sovereign. Henry VIII also made use of the Protestant Reformation to seize the power of the Roman Catholic Church, confiscating the property of the monasteries and declaring himself the head of the new Anglican Church. Under the Tudors, the English state was centralized and rationalized as a bureaucracy built up and the government became run and managed by educated functionaries. The most notable new institution was the Star Chamber.

The new power of the monarch was given a basis by the notion of the divine right of kings to rule over their subjects. James I was a major proponent of this idea and wrote extensively on it. 

The same forces that had reduced the power of the traditional aristocracy also served to increase the power of the commercial classes. The rise of trade and the central importance of money to the operation of the government gave this new class great power, but power that was not reflected in the government structure. This would lead to a long contest during the 17th century between the forces of the monarch and parliament. 

=== Elizabethan era (1558–1603) ===

The Elizabethan Era is the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and is known to be a golden age in English history. It was the height of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of English literature and poetry. This was also the time during which Elizabethan theatre was famous and William Shakespeare, among others, composed plays that broke away from England&#x27;s past style of plays and theatre. It was an age of expansion and exploration abroad, while at home the Protestant Reformation became entrenched in the national mindset.

The Elizabethan Age is viewed so highly because of the contrasts with the periods before and after. It was a brief period of largely internal peace between the English Reformation and the battles between Protestants and Catholics and the battles between parliament and the monarchy that engulfed the 17th century. The Protestant/Catholic divide was settled, for a time, by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, and parliament was not yet strong enough to challenge royal absolutism. England was also well-off compared to the other nations of Europe. The Italian Renaissance had come to an end under the weight of foreign domination of the peninsula. France was embroiled in its own religious battles that would only be settled in 1598 with the Edict of Nantes. In part because of this, but also because the English had been expelled from their last outposts on the continent, the centuries long conflict between France and England was largely suspended for most of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign. 

The one great rival was Spain, with which England conflicted both in Europe and the Americas in skirmishes that exploded into the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). The conflict might be said to be the first world war, in that it was fought on two continents (Europe and the Americas) and two oceans (the Atlantic and, just barely, the Pacific).

England during this period had a centralised, well-organised, and effective government, largely a result of the reforms of Henry VII and Henry VIII. Economically, the country began to benefit greatly from the new era of trans-Atlantic trade.

== Scotland from 15th century to 1603 ==
Scotland advanced markedly in educational terms during the 15th century with the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495, and with the passing of the Education Act 1496.

In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry. 

After the death of James III in 1488, during or after the Battle of Sauchieburn, his successor James IV successfully ended the quasi-independent rule of the Lord of the Isles, bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time. In 1503, he married Henry VII&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Tudor, thus laying the foundation for the 17th century Union of the Crowns. James IV&#x27;s reign is often considered to be a period of cultural flourishing, and it was around this period that the European Renaissance began to infiltrate Scotland. James IV was the last Scottish king known to speak Gaelic, although some suggest his son could also. 

In 1512, under a treaty extending the Auld Alliance, all nationals of Scotland and France also became nationals of each other&#x27;s countries, a status not repealed in France until 1903 and which may never have been repealed in Scotland. However a year later, the Auld Alliance had more disastrous effects when James IV was required to launch an invasion of England to support the French when they were attacked by the English under Henry VIII. The invasion was stopped decisively at the battle of Flodden during which the King, many of his nobles, and over 10,000 troops—&quot;The Flowers of the Forest&quot;—were killed. The extent of the disaster impacted throughout Scotland because of the large numbers killed, and once again Scotland&#x27;s government lay in the hands of regents. The song &quot;The Flooers o&#x27; the Forest&quot; commemorated this, an echo of the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; on a similar tragedy in about 600. 

When James V finally managed to escape from the custody of the regents with the aid of his redoubtable mother in 1528, he once again set about subduing the rebellious Highlands, Western and Northern isles, as his father had had to do. He married the French noblewoman Mary of Guise. His reign was fairly successful, until another disastrous campaign against England led to defeat at the battle of Solway Moss (1542). James died a short time later. The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who became Mary, Queen of Scots. James is supposed to have remarked in Scots that &quot;it cam wi a lass, it will gang wi a lass&quot;—referring to the House of Stewart which began with Walter Stewart&#x27;s marriage to the daughter of Robert the Bruce. Once again, Scotland was in the hands of a regent, James Hamilton, Earl of Arran. 

=== Mary, Queen of Scots ===

Within two years, the Rough Wooing, Henry VIII&#x27;s military attempt to force a marriage between Mary and his son, Edward, had begun. There was border skirmishing and in May 1544, a large English army burnt Edinburgh. In 1547, after the death of Henry VIII forces under the English regent Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset were victorious at the Battle of Pinkie, the climax of the Rough Wooing, and followed up by occupying Haddington. 

Mary was sent to France at the age of five, as the intended bride of the heir to the French throne. Her mother, Mary of Guise, stayed in Scotland to look after the interests of Mary and of France, while the Earl of Arran continued to act as Regent. Mary returned to Scotland after the death of her husband, Francis II of France. 

Mary lost control of Scotland after seven years and was imprisoned for a time in Lochleven Castle and forced to abdicate. She eventually escaped and attempted to regain the throne by force. After her defeat at the Battle of Langside in 1568 she took refuge in England, leaving her young son, James VI, in the hands of regents. In England she became a focal point for Catholic conspirators and was eventually executed on the orders of her kinswoman Elizabeth I.

=== Protestant Reformation ===

During the 16th century, Scotland underwent a Protestant Reformation. In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first Martin Luther and then John Calvin began to influence Scotland. The execution of a number of Protestant preachers, most notably the Lutheran influenced Patrick Hamilton in 1528 and later the proto-Calvinist George Wishart in 1546 who was burnt at the stake in St. Andrews by Cardinal Beaton for heresy, did nothing to stem the growth of these ideas. Beaton was assassinated shortly after the execution of George Wishart.

The eventual Reformation of the Scottish Church followed a brief civil war in 1559–60, in which English intervention at the siege of Leith on the Protestant side was decisive. A Reformed confession of faith was adopted by Parliament in 1560, while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France. The most influential figure was John Knox, who had been a disciple of both John Calvin and George Wishart. Roman Catholicism was not eliminated, and remained strong particularly in parts of the highlands.

The Reformation remained somewhat precarious through the reign of Queen Mary, who remained Roman Catholic but tolerated Protestantism. Following her deposition in 1567, her infant son James VI was raised as a Protestant. In 1603, following the death of the childless Queen Elizabeth I, the crown of England passed to James. He took the title James I of England and James VI of Scotland, thus unifying these two countries under his personal rule. For a time, this remained the only political connection between two independent nations, but it foreshadowed the eventual 1707 union of Scotland and England under the banner of the Great Britain.

==Early Stuart era: 1603–1660==
=== Union of the Crowns ===

The Union of the Crowns refers to the accession of James VI, King of Scots, to the throne as King James I of England while remaining King James VI of Scotland. One man ruled two separate kingdoms with separate governments and cabinets. The two countries remained distinct and separate until the Acts of Union 1707. Within eight hours of the death of Elizabeth, James was proclaimed king in London, the news received without protest or disturbance.

The Jacobean era refers to the years of the reign of James I in England, 1603–1625. The Jacobean era succeeds the Elizabethan era and precedes the Caroline era, and specifically denotes a style of architecture, visual arts, decorative arts, and literature that is predominant of that period.

The Caroline era refers to the years of the reign of King Charles I over both countries, 1625–1642. It was followed by the English Civil War (1642–1651) and the English Interregnum (1651–1660), when there was no king.

=== English Civil War ===

The English Civil War consisted of a series of armed conflicts and political machinations that took place between Parliamentarians (known as Roundheads) and Royalists (known as Cavaliers) between 1642 and 1651. The first (1642–1646) and second (1648–1649) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war (1649–1651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. The &quot;Diggers&quot; were a group begun by Gerrard Winstanley in 1649 who attempted to reform the existing social order with an agrarian lifestyle based upon their ideas for the creation of small egalitarian rural communities. They were one of a number of nonconformist dissenting groups that emerged around this time.
The English Interregnum was the period of parliamentary and military rule in the land occupied by modern-day England and Wales after the English Civil War. It began with the regicide of Charles I in 1649 and ended with the restoration of Charles II in 1660.

===Protectorate 1653–1660===

The Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son Charles II, and the replacement of the English monarchy with first the Commonwealth of England (1649–1653) and then with The Protectorate (1653–1659), under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell. Upon his death, his son took over, but proved a weak ruler with very little support. The military and religious elements that supported Cromwell began disputing with each other.

==Later Stuart era: 1660–1714==
===Restoration 1660–1688===

In 1660, the remaining members of the Long Parliament (1640–1660) rejected the anarchy and confusion since Cromwell&#x27;s death. Elite and popular opinion called for a restoration of the monarchy under the Stuarts. There was widespread revulsion against the intense moralism and high taxes of the Rule of the Major-Generals in 1657. Nostalgia for Royal traditionalism was strong. Gen. George Monck, a former supporter of Cromwell, led the movement for a royal restoration. Charles II in exile paid close attention to the developments and readied himself to take the throne. From Breda in Holland he issued the Declaration of Breda, promising generosity and indicating his willingness to leave the settlement to Parliament. The Convention Parliament, which had been elected to negotiate with the King, invited Charles to return, He landed at Dover amid great enthusiasm on May 26, 1660.
The new parliament, known as the Cavalier Parliament enacted the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Strict rules were set up such that only genuine members of the established Church could hold office. The major foreign policy issue was the trade rivalry with the Dutch, leading to the inconclusive Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–67. The only positive result was the acquisition of New Netherland, which became New York. Coincidental with the war with the Dutch, was the Great Plague of London of 1665–66, which at its worst cost 1000 deaths a day in London. On top of that, the Great Fire of London burned out the main commercial districts of London; it destroyed 13,000 buildings, but few lives were lost. In 1670, King Charles entered into the Secret Treaty of Dover, an alliance with his first cousin King Louis XIV. Louis agreed to aid him in the Third Anglo-Dutch War and pay him a pension, and Charles secretly promised to convert to Catholicism at an unspecified future date; he did so on his deathbed. Charles attempted to introduce religious equality for Catholics and non-Anglican Protestant dissenters with his 1672 Royal Declaration of Indulgence. Elite opinion rejected it and Parliament forced him to withdraw it. In 1679, Titus Oates&#x27;s highly exaggerated revelations of a supposed &quot;Popish Plot&quot; sparked the Exclusion Crisis when it was revealed that Charles&#x27;s brother and heir (James, Duke of York) was a Catholic. The issue was whether or not to exclude James from succession to the throne. The crisis sparked the creation of the first political parties: the pro-exclusion Whig Party demanded that James never reach the throne. The anti-exclusion Tory party believed it was against God&#x27;s will to interfere with the legitimate succession, and supported both the King and James. After the discovery of the failed 1683 Rye House Plot to murder Charles and James, some Whig leaders were executed or forced into exile. Charles dissolved Parliament in 1681, and ruled alone until his death on 6 February 1685.

===Glorious Revolution 1688–89===

When Charles II died in 1685, his brother became King James II; He ruled with the support of the Tory party. He forced a series of highly unpopular proposals that would restore Catholicism to England. The Monmouth Rebellion broke out in western areas that was brutally suppressed. Elite opinion strongly turned against the king, and in late 1688 the elites invited William III and Mary II to govern. James went into exile in France, where his claims to the English throne were promoted by King Louis XIV. In England the claims were upheld by the Jacobite faction of Tories, who in alliance with France were a military threat to the throne for the next half-century.

William III ruled 1689–1702, while his wife Queen Mary II was the nominal co-ruler until her death in 1694. Constitutionally, the Glorious Revolution established a precedent that British monarchs could not govern without the consent of Parliament, as enacted through the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the passage of the English Bill of Rights, and the Hanoverian succession.

====Anglo-Dutch Wars====
The Anglo-Dutch Wars were a series of three wars which took place between the English and the Dutch from 1652 to 1674. The causes included political disputes and increasing competition from merchant shipping. Religion was not a factor, since both sides were Protestant. The British in the first war (1652–54) had the naval advantage with larger numbers of more powerful &quot;ships of the line&quot; which were well suited to the naval tactics of the era. The British also captured numerous Dutch merchant ships. In the second war (1665–67) Dutch naval victories followed. This second war cost London ten times more than it had planned on, and the king sued for peace in 1667 with the Treaty of Breda. It ended the fights over &quot;mercantilism&quot; (the use of force to protect and expand national trade, industry, and shipping). Meanwhile, the French were building up fleets that threatened both the Netherlands and Great Britain. In the third war (1672–74), the British counted on a new alliance with France but the outnumbered Dutch outsailed both of them, and King Charles II ran short of money and political support. The Dutch gained domination of sea trading routes until 1713. The British gained the thriving colony of New Netherland, and renamed it New York.

== 18th century ==
The 18th century was characterised by numerous major wars, especially with France, with the growth and collapse of the First British Empire, with the origins of the Second British Empire, and with steady economic and social growth at home.

Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years&#x27; War as allies, but the conflict – waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance – left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century would see England (after 1707, Great Britain) rise to be the world&#x27;s dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.

In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession. The conflict, which France and Spain were to lose, lasted until 1714. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, gaining Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar, which is still part of the British Overseas Territories to this day, became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

=== Treaty of Union ===

The united Kingdom of Great Britain was born on May 1, 1707, shortly after the parliaments of Scotland and England had ratified the Treaty of Union of 1706 by each approving Acts of Union combining the two parliaments and the two royal titles. Deeper political integration had been a key policy of Queen Anne (reigned 1702–14). Under the aegis of the Queen and her advisors a Treaty of Union was drawn up, and negotiations between England and Scotland began in earnest in 1706.

Scottish proponents of union believed that failure to accede to the Bill would result in the imposition of union under less favourable terms, and months of fierce debate in both capital cities and throughout both kingdoms followed. In Scotland, the debate on occasion dissolved into civil disorder, most notably by the notorious &#x27;Edinburgh Mob&#x27;. The prospect of a union of the kingdoms was deeply unpopular among the Scottish population at large, and talk of an uprising was widespread. However Scotland could not long continue. Following the financially disastrous Darien scheme, the near-bankrupt Parliament of Scotland reluctantly accepted the proposals. Supposed financial payoffs to Scottish parliamentarians were later referred to by Robert Burns when he wrote &quot;We&#x27;re bought and sold for English gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation! Recent historians, however, have emphasised the legitimacy of the vote.

The Acts of Union took effect in 1707, uniting the separate Parliaments and crowns of England and Scotland and forming the single Kingdom of Great Britain. Queen Anne (already Queen of both England and Scotland) became formally the first occupant of the unified British throne, with Scotland sending forty-five Members to join all existing Members from the parliament of England in the new House of Commons of Great Britain, as well as 16 Scottish representative peers to join all existing peers from the parliament of England in the new House of Lords.

===Jacobite risings===

Dynastic security was a factor in Britain, as, indeed, it was in other countries. The House of Stuart had abdicated the throne when King James II (1633–1701) fled to France in 1688. However he and his son James Francis Edward Stuart claimed to be the legitimate kings, and had the support of important elements in England, as well as King Louis XIV. The main issue was religion; the Stuarts had the support of Catholic Europe, while the Whigs in Britain were staunch opponents of Catholicism. The great majority of Tories refused to support the Jacobites publicly, although there were numerous quiet supporters. After the death of King William III (1702) and Queen Anne (1714), the succession went to the Protestant House of Hanover, starting with King George I in 1714. They were Germans who were not especially popular in Britain. The island nation was vulnerable only to a seaborne invasion, which the Jacobites plotted and attempted. The major attempts were the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. Both failed to rally significant popular support, and the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 ending any realistic hope of a Stuart restoration. Historian Basil Williams says, &quot;there was never any serious danger to the dynasty.&quot;

===Overseas trade===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and Daniel Defoe boasted:
:We are the most &quot;diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people.&quot;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the House of Hohenzollern), Britain had a different set of primary interests. Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion) was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers. This required a hegemonic Royal Navy so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world&#x27;s trading routes, or invade the British Isles. The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the Muscovy Company set up in 1555 to trade with Russia. Other prominent enterprises included the East India Company, and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in Canada.

The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the Royal African Company in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the triangular slave trade paid off handsomely in terms of its profits. Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America. British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England. British exports soared from £6.5 million in 1700, to £14.7 million in 1760 and £43.2 million in 1800.

There was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king. His chief minister Robert Walpole managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.

===Slave trade===
An important result of the Treaty of Utrecht was the enlarging of Britain&#x27;s role in the slave trade. Of special importance was the successful secret negotiation with France to obtain thirty-year monopoly on the Spanish slave trade, known as the &quot;Asiento de Negros&quot;. Anne also allowed colonies like Virginia to make laws that promoted black slavery. Anne had secretly negotiated with France to get its approval regarding the &quot;Asiento.&quot; She boasted to Parliament of her success in taking the &quot;Asiento&quot; away from France and London celebrated her economic coup. Most of the slave trade involved sales to Spanish colonies in the Caribbean, and to Mexico, as well as sales to British colonies in the Caribbean and in North America. Historian Vinita Ricks says the agreement allotted Queen Anne &quot;22.5% (and King Philip V, of Spain 28%) of all profits collected for her personal fortune.&quot; Ricks concludes that the Queen&#x27;s &quot;connection to slave trade revenue meant that she was no longer a neutral observer. She had a vested interest in what happened on slave ships.&quot; In addition to sales to the Spanish colonies, Britain had its own sugar islands in the Caribbean, especially Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and Antigua, which provided a steady flow of profits from the slave labor that produced the sugar.

===Warfare and finance===
From 1700 to 1850, Britain was involved in 137 wars or rebellions. Apart from losing the American Revolutionary War, it was generally successful in warfare, and was especially successful in financing its military commitments. France and Spain, by contrast, went bankrupt. Britain maintained a relatively large and expensive Royal Navy, along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in government financing from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the City, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.

=== British Empire ===
The Seven Years&#x27; War, which began in 1756, was the first war waged on a global scale, fought in Europe, India, North America, the Caribbean, the Philippines and coastal Africa. The signing of the Treaty of Paris (1763) had important consequences for Britain and its empire. In North America, France&#x27;s future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the ceding of New France to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and Louisiana to Spain. Spain ceded Florida to Britain. In India, the Carnatic War had left France still in control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. The British victory over France in the Seven Years&#x27; War therefore left Britain as the world&#x27;s dominant colonial power.

During the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament&#x27;s ability to tax American colonists without their consent. Disagreement turned to violence and in 1775 the American Revolutionary War began. The following year, the colonists declared the independence of the United States and with economic and naval assistance from France, would go on to win the war in 1783. The Treaties of Versailles were signed, also ending war with the French and Spanish. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War ended the following year.

The loss of the United States, at the time Britain&#x27;s most populous colony, is seen by historians as the event defining the transition between the &quot;first&quot; and &quot;second&quot; empires, in which Britain shifted its attention away from the Americas to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783 confirmed Smith&#x27;s view that political control was not necessary for economic success.

During its 1st century of operation, the focus of the British East India Company had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the British East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, &quot;La Compagnie française des Indes orientales&quot;, during the Carnatic Wars of the 1740s and 1750s. The Battle of Plassey, which saw the British, led by Robert Clive, defeat the French and their Indian allies, left the Company in control of Bengal and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the Indian Army, 80% of which was composed of native Indian sepoys.

In 1770, James Cook became the first European to visit the eastern coast of Australia whilst on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific. In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook&#x27;s botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788.

At the threshold to the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under Napoleon, in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations. 
It was not only Britain&#x27;s position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun. The Napoleonic Wars were therefore ones that Britain invested large amounts of capital and resources to win. French ports were blockaded by the Royal Navy, which won a decisive victory over the French fleet at Trafalgar in 1805.

=== Growth of state power ===
Recently historians have undertaken a deeper exploration of the growth of state power. They especially look at the &quot;long 18th century&quot;, from about 1660 to 1837 from four fresh perspectives. The first approach, developed by Oliver MacDonagh, presented an expansive and centralized administrative state while deemphasizing the influence of Benthamite utilitarianism.

The second approach, as developed by Edward Higgs, conceptualizes the state as an information-gathering entity, paying special attention to local registrars and the census. He brings in such topics as spies, surveillance of Catholics, the 1605 Gunpowder Plot led by Guy Fawkes to overthrow the government, and the Poor Laws, and demonstrates similarities to the surveillance society of the 21st century.

John Brewer introduced the third approach with his depiction of the unexpectedly powerful, centralized &#x27;fiscal-military&#x27; state during the eighteenth century. Finally, there have been numerous recent studies that explore the state as an abstract entity capable of commanding the loyalties of those people over whom it rules.

<doc id="967014" wikidata="Q679247" url="?curid=967014" title="List of largest cities of U.S. states and territories by population">
<text>This is a list of the five most populous incorporated places and the capital city in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 inhabited territories of the United States, as of July 1, 2023, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau. 

==Census-designated places on the list==

Note 1: The only incorporated place in Hawaii is the City &amp; County of Honolulu. A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes regarded as the &quot;city&quot; for statistical purposes, although it has no government separate from that of the City and County as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (census-designated place) to coincide with the Honolulu District. Thus for Hawaii, the largest CDPs are ranked, as of the 2020 United States census.

Note 2: The 4 municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands are listed. Each municipality is divided into smaller villages, but the municipalities are considered the primary subdivisions (as in how Saipan is usually listed as the capital rather than Capitol Hill, Saipan). The five largest villages are Garapan (3,983), Dandan (3,280), Koblerville (2,493), Finasisu (2,491) and Kagman III (2,402), with Capitol Hill being the 19th largest village at 1,028 people.

Note 3: The most populous sub-districts of the U.S. Virgin Islands (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) are listed. The three largest towns are Charlotte Amalie (10,354), Christiansted (2,433) and Frederiksted (859).

<text>The Seward Highway is a highway in the U.S. state of Alaska that extends from Seward to Anchorage. It was completed in 1951 and runs through the scenic Kenai Peninsula, Chugach National Forest, Turnagain Arm, and Kenai Mountains. The Seward Highway is numbered Alaska Route 9 (AK-9) for the first from Seward to the Sterling Highway and [[Alaska Route 1|AK-1]] for the remaining distance to Anchorage. At the junction with the Sterling Highway, AK-1 turns west towards Sterling and Homer. About of the Seward Highway leading into Anchorage is built to freeway standards. In Anchorage, the Seward Highway terminates at an intersection with 5th Avenue, which AK-1 is routed to, and which then leads to the Glenn Highway freeway.

==Route description==
The full length of the Seward Highway has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. The segment designated AK-9 between Seward and Tern Lake Junction is part of the STRAHNET subsystem, highways that are important to defense policy and which provide defense access, continuity and emergency capabilities for defense purposes. The remainder that follows AK-1 is also designated Interstate A-1 (A-1) and included in the NHS on that basis. The state&#x27;s Interstate Highways are not required to comply with Interstate Highway standards, instead &quot;shall be designed in accordance with such geometric and construction standards as are adequate for current and probable future traffic demands and the needs of the locality of the highway&quot; under federal law. The highway is maintained by the Alaska Department of Transportation &amp; Public Facilities (Alaska DOT&amp;PF), and the A-1 designation is not signed along the highway. In 2010, 2,520 vehicles used the highway near the junction with Sterling Highway in a measure of the annual average daily traffic, the lowest tally along the highway. The highest traffic count as recorded by Alaska DOT&amp;PF was 58,799 vehicles daily at the Dowling Road overpass in Anchorage. In 2012, Life magazine included the Seward Highway in its list of Most Scenic Drives in the World.

===Seward to Bear Creek===


The Seward Highway begins at an intersection with Railway Avenue, in Seward, less than from Resurrection Bay. At this point, the Seward Highway is two lanes, with a parking lane on each side. The Seward Highway is designated as AK-9 at this point of the route. The highway continues through downtown Seward and residential areas. The highway continues past the Seward Airport and Exit Glacier road, before entering the unincorporated community of Bear Creek. Just after entering Bear Creek, a series of tracks belonging to the Alaska Railroad comes alongside the roadway. These railroad tracks continue on with the Seward Highway until Moose Pass, return near a junction with the Portage Glacier Highway, and remain until the highway becomes a freeway, in southern Anchorage. The Seward Highway proceeds through central Bear Creek, passing Bear Lake, until entering Chugach National Forest.

===Chugach National Forest===
The Seward Highway enters the Chugach National Forest just after its start. The highway enters the Chugach National Forest while it is still part of the Bear Creek community, so it gives the appearance of still being inside that census-designated place. After a mile or so (1.6 km) though, the area surrounding the highway begins to look more like a national forest. The Alaska Railroad weaves back and forth under the highway, which causes the highway to traverse a series of small bridges. For a few miles after the bridges, the Seward Highway is a four-lane road, but then merges back to two lane. After passing through about of forest, the highway passes Primrose Spur Road, and enters Primrose. For the next five or so miles (8 km), the route runs on a thin strip of land between the mountains and Kenai Lake. At the northern end of Kenai Lake, the route passes through Crown Point, and provides access to a large campground where Trail Creek empties into Kenai Lake. The highway runs alongside Trail Creek for about , before passing the settlement of Moose Pass. The road continues, passing along Upper Trail Lake for a few miles, before returning to the dense forest, and passing a large mountain range. After a few more miles, the road passes the Tern Lake Junction, and intersects with Alaska Route 1 (AK-1) (also known as the Sterling Highway), where Alaska Route 9 terminates, and the Seward Highway is designated to AK-1.
It is at this point that the road begins to climb into the actual mountains to approach Turnagain Pass. For several miles, the roadway continues through large, Alaskan spruce forests. After approximately , the highway passes Summit Lake, and provides access to another large campground. The road then continues through the mountains. After about , the route intersects the Hope Highway, which provides access to the city of Hope, and the highway reenters forest. The route continues through the mountains for about more, before a steep decline, at which point the highway exits the Kenai Peninsula and continues along the shores Turnagain Arm. Just after reaching Turnagain Arm, the highway enters the city limits of Anchorage (and remains within Anchorage proper for the remainder of its route). After intersecting the Portage Glacier Highway the Alaska Railroad tracks again come alongside the route. The highway continues through the Chugach National Forest for approximately , passing the Turnagain Arm to the west, and the Kenai Mountains to the east. It then exits the Chugach National Forest, having spent approximately inside its boundaries.

===Girdwood to Anchorage===


After the highway exits the National Forest, it continues for about through spruce forest, before passing the community of Girdwood. After about a mile, the highway enters Chugach State Park. The road continues through forest for about more, before passing the small skiing village of Bird. The route reenters the park for about a mile, before entering the village of Indian, and then reentering the forest. The Seward Highway passes along the coast of Cook Inlet for about , with the Kenai Mountains running along the northern side. The highway then proceeds to enter the suburban area of Anchorage. The highway intersects Old Seward Highway, before becoming a four-lane freeway. The freeway&#x27;s first exit is, in fact, for Old Seward Highway. The freeway continues past several neighborhoods, a plant nursery, and Rabbit Creek Elementary School.

At an exit for De Armoun Road, the highway&#x27;s frontage road begins. The freeway continues past dozens of neighborhoods, a few small businesses, and provides exits for a few small roads, including the Minnesota Drive Expressway. After the exit for Abbott Road, part of the frontage road terminates. The route then passes through a more commercial area of Anchorage, passing several warehouses. At the freeway&#x27;s final exit, for Tudor Road, the rest of the frontage roads either begin or terminate. The freeway ends at the highway&#x27;s intersection with East 36th Avenue. About a half a mile (1 km) later, the highway splits into Ingra Street (northbound), and Gambell Street (southbound). The Seward Highway officially reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with 5th Avenue. AK-1 continues on for a short period as 5th Avenue, before becoming known as the Glenn Highway.

==History==

An stretch of the Seward Highway, traveling from Seward to Kenai Lake was completed in 1923. Another segment of the highway, running between Moose Pass and Hope, was completed in 1928. The Mile 18 bridge, nicknamed &quot;The Missing Link&quot;, which would connect the Seward and Moose Pass portions, was not completed until 1946, which was a major cause of the delayed completion of the highway. The roadway was completed on October 19, 1951, connecting Seward to the major city of Anchorage by road for the first time (Seward was previously reached by sea, rail, or air). The entire length of the highway was paved in 1952. During the 1964 Alaska earthquake, about of the Seward Highway sank below the high water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964–66.

The highway was designated a National Forest Scenic Byway by the United States Forest Service on September 8, 1989. Later, the State of Alaska added it to the State Scenic Byway system on January 29, 1993. The final designation was added on June 15, 2000, when the Seward Highway was named an All-American Road as part of the National Scenic Byway program by the United States Secretary of Transportation. The length of the highway traveling from the AK-1 and AK-9 intersection to the northern terminus is designated as Interstate A-3 by the National Highway System.

In July 2016, Alaska DOT&amp;PF officials posted updated speed limits on a section of the Seward Highway south of Anchorage between Hope Junction to the top of Turnagain Pass. The limit in the right lane is , while that in the left lane is . The project is designed to enhance safety and improve congestion by enforcing passing lane usage.

In 2017, Alaska DOT&amp;PF announced a four-year Milepost 75–90 Rehabilitation Project, scheduled to begin in 2018, to make major safety improvements to a busy crash-prone section of the Seward Highway from Girdwood to beyond the Portage curve toward Turnagain Pass ending at Ingram Creek. In July 2015 a tour bus crash at milepost 79 killed one man and critically injured several others, causing a 10-hour traffic jam. During the summer months, up to 15,000 vehicles use this stretch of Seward Highway daily.

==Interstate Highway System==
Seward Highway is part of the unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System as Interstate A-3.

==U.S. Bicycle Route 97==
United States Bicycle Route 97 is a U.S. Bicycle Route located along Alaska Route 1. The bike route runs alongside the Seward Highway along the entire length of the highway. The bike route was created in 2011.

==Major intersections==














==Old Seward Highway==


The Old Seward Highway is a nearly former routing of the Seward Highway. The road is located entirely within the corporate limits of Anchorage, with a southern terminus near the Potter Section House, and a northern terminus in the Midtown neighborhood. Both of this highway&#x27;s termini are points on the Seward Highway. The highway was created in 1951, along with most of the current Seward Highway.

The Old Seward Highway begins at an intersection with Potter Valley Road, less than 500 feet from Potter Valley Road&#x27;s own terminus with the (new) Seward Highway. From there, Old Seward Highway curves along the east side of Potter Marsh opposite the New Seward Highway (on the west side) before intersecting Rabbit Creek Road, again less than a 1/4 mile from the New Seward Highway, which is at this point a four-lane freeway. From there, Old Seward Highway travels northwest over the New Seward Highway and through the neighborhood of Oceanview. The route bends north, running parallel to the New Seward Highway. The roadway intersects O&#x27;Malley Road and continues northward through the Campbell/Taku neighborhood. The road proceeds north into Midtown, traveling through the neighborhood to the highway&#x27;s northern terminus, an intersection with 33rd Avenue near the Moose&#x27;s Tooth Pub and Pizzeria. An exit ramp from the New Seward Highway serves as the beginning of the southbound lanes.

The Old Seward Highway was created in 1951, as part of the original routing of the Seward Highway. Beginning in 1976, the state of Alaska designated three projects to reroute a large portion of the Seward Highway. This rerouting would bypass the section of the highway that is now the Old Seward Highway. The final portion of the rerouting was completed in early June 1998.

<text>Doug Martindale (born May 25, 1947) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 2011, serving as a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Early life and career==

Martindale was born in Brockville, Ontario. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Brock University (1973) and a Master of Divinity degree from Victoria University (1976). He is an ordained United Church minister, and has practiced in Saskatchewan (1976–80) and at a mission in north-end Winnipeg (1980–90). He has been involved in several outreach programs among Winnipeg&#x27;s poor and aboriginal communities, and remains active in efforts to combat homelessness. He helped to convert St. John&#x27;s United Church into a co-op apartment complex, and was a founding member of Inner City Voice newspaper. In the legislature, he has served as Chair of the Justice, Social and Economic Development Committees.

In 1973, he married Carol Wachniak. The couple has two children.

Martindale defeated incumbent MLA Conrad Santos to win the New Democratic Party nomination for the northwest Winnipeg division of Burrows in the 1988 provincial election. He was defeated in the general election by Liberal candidate William Chornopyski. The seat had previously been regarded as safe for the NDP, but local divisions and a provincial swing away from the party contributed to Martindale&#x27;s defeat.

==Opposition member==

NDP support had recovered somewhat by the 1990 election, and Martindale was able to defeat Chornopyski in a rematch. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government under Gary Filmon, and Martindale served in the official opposition as his party&#x27;s critic for family services and housing. He opposed the Filmon government&#x27;s cuts to child welfare and education support, and called for an inquiry into allegations of emotional abuse and unethical treatment at the Osborne House battered women&#x27;s shelter. He also criticized the government&#x27;s introduction of a &quot;welfare fraud hotline&quot;, describing it as &quot;punitive and unnecessary&quot; and noting that Manitoba lost far more money each year to income tax fraud. Nonetheless, Martindale supported the government&#x27;s early intervention policy as a means of keeping more children with their families and out of the supervision of Child and Family Services.

Martindale was re-elected in the 1995 general election, as the Progressive Conservatives won a second majority government across the province. He continued to serve as family services critic, and opposed another round of child welfare cuts introduced by the Filmon government later in the year. When the government introduced further benefit cuts of up to 10% for single, employable people, Martindale described Filmon&#x27;s administration as the &quot;cruelest, most heartless government in Canada&quot;. In 1999, he and fellow NDP MLA Diane McGifford organized consultative meetings of parents and day-care providers.

==Government backbencher==

The New Democratic Party won a majority government in the 1999 general election under the leadership of Gary Doer. Martindale was easily re-elected in Burrows, defeating controversial school trustee Mike Babinsky of the Liberal Party. He served as a backbench supporter of the Doer government. In 2002, he was appointed to a four-member task force seeking public input on the future of the province&#x27;s mining and petroleum sectors. There was some speculation that he would be appointed to cabinet after his re-election in 2003, but this did not occur.

In 2004, Martindale brought forward a parliamentary motion urging the provincial government to declare the last Saturday of November as Day of the Ukrainian Famine/Genocide, commemorating the victims of the Holodomor of 1932-33. He was an international observer to the Ukrainian presidential election in December 2004.

Martindale was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election.

In 2011, he announced that he would not be seeking reelection. Martindale said that he would be teaching at Booth University College and Providence University College, and would return to preaching as a United Church minister.

==Federal politics==

Martindale supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to become leader of the federal New Democratic Party in 1995, and endorsed Bill Blaikie in 2003.

==Trivia==

*Martindale played the role of J.S. Woodsworth during a 1994 commemoration of the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike.
*Since 2001, Martindale has taken part in a challenge organized by Evangelicals for Social Action to fast and pray during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He has called for greater dialogue between Christian and Muslim groups.

<text>Leung Ting (; born 28 February 1947) is a Hong Kong martial artist, publisher, choreographer, screenwriter, director, and former actor. He is also the founder of International WingTsun Association. He was a student of Leung Sheung and later become the last student of grandmaster Yip Man.

==Background==
Born in Hong Kong in 1947, he was originally a student of Leung Sheung, and later become a closed door disciple of Yip Man. Appointed by Grandmaster Ip Man, Leung served as head instructor on the board of directors for the Ving Tsun Athletic association between Dec 1969 to May 1970, before leaving to found his own Association. Leung Ting is the founder and president of the International WingTsun Association.

Leung Ting is the founder and president of the International Wing Tsun Association. Appointed by Grandmaster Ip Man, Leung served as head instructor on the board of directors for the Ving Tsun Athletic association from Dec 1969 to May 1970, before leaving to found his own Association.

Leung chose the spelling of Wing Tsun to differentiate his teachings from those of other Wing Chun schools, and to keep them from passing off their style as his own. (There is no standard romanization of Cantonese; the Chinese characters remain the same.)

Among the achievements in his career outside of teaching and writing about Wing Tsun, Leung has been a fight director in some Hong Kong films. Leung was the director and screenwriter for &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad Kung Fu World!&quot; (大踢爆), a humoristic documentary on the history and culture of kung fu. Leung appeared on episode 1 of the first season of the BBC show &quot;Mind, Body &amp; Kick Ass Moves&quot;; a 10 part series on martial arts masters of the east hosted by Chris Crudelli.

==Lineage controversy==
Some of Yip Man&#x27;s students have disputed whether Leung Ting could be considered a closed door disciple of Yip Man, some going as far as to question whether Leung ever studied directly under Ip Man, including William Cheung and most notably including Ip Chun, Ip Man&#x27;s eldest son and co-author of the book written with Leung Ting, 116 Wing Tsun Dummy Techniques (1981). Ip claimed &quot;我老豆最憎最嬲係梁挺呢個人！&quot; (My father dislike this person Leung Ting the most!) and also &quot;唔係葉問徒弟&quot; (Leung Ting is not Yip Man&#x27;s student). In response to Ip Chun&#x27;s accusations, Leung Ting organised a public press conference in Hong Kong in May 2010 to showcase photographic evidence of his own close direct relationship with Yip Man. Existing photo evidence shows that Leung Ting did appear with Yip Man in numerous high-profile events, including the only 2 interviews Yip Man ever conducted, private lessons, Leung Ting&#x27;s wedding, and public martial art demonstrations. Leung Ting publicly threatened to initiate a defamation claim against Ip Chun if an apology and withdrawal of accusations was not received. Ip Chun has since been quiet on this matter.

In other evidence, in one of the only 2 interviews Yip Man ever conducted before his death, Leung Ting was mentioned by Yip Man as one of his closed door disciples in New Martial Hero magazine 1972, copy 56, page 31, paragraph 2, line 5 - 教師梁挺係其一位封門弟子 (Instructor Leung Ting is a closed door disciple). Photos from the interview show Leung was with Yip man during the time.

The controversy had been in part fuelled by past allegations that a photo Leung presented showing him with Yip Man was altered from a photograph that shows Yip Man with the chief editor of the &quot;New Martial Hero&quot; magazine. Leung has denied the head change, claiming that the editor of New Martial Hero had pasted his own head over Leung&#x27;s for the article. Evidence shows Leung&#x27;s photo to be uncropped and at a higher resolution to the magazine&#x27;s published photo. Other photo evidence shows Leung at Yip Man&#x27;s funeral with an armband that apparently denotes a rank other than first generation (i.e., an armband that indicates that Leung was a grand-student of Yip Man&#x27;s rather than a direct student).

==Other controversy==
On 20 November 2009, Leung was acquitted of a two-month prison sentence for allegedly assaulting his former girlfriend, Regina Lip Sik-ying, a claim which was later quashed. Lip testified that Leung hit her after a heated argument involving Leung&#x27;s ex-wife. Leung testified that Lip fell when Leung pulled her down from a window where she threatened to commit suicide after Leung refused to provide $5000 for plane tickets and an abortion. On hearing the verdict Leung shouted &#x27;Objection!&#x27;, and even shouted &quot;bullshit&quot; at the judge during the court case. On 29 April 2010, the conviction was quashed by Court of First Instance Judge Darryl Gordon Saw. Judge Saw ruled that the medical reports did not support Lip&#x27;s testimony but did support Leung&#x27;s. Leung was cleared of all charges.

<doc id="967090" wikidata="Q935269" url="?curid=967090" title="Robert Dinwiddie">
<text>Robert Dinwiddie (1692 – 27 July 1770) was a Scottish colonial administrator who served as the lieutenant governor of Virginia from 1751 to 1758. Since the governors of Virginia remained in Great Britain, he served as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the colony of Virginia. Dinwiddie is credited for starting the military career of George Washington.

==Early life==

Dinwiddie was born at Glasgow before 2 October 1692, the son of Robert Dinwiddie of Germiston and Elizabeth Cumming. His younger brother Lawrence Dinwiddie was later Lord Provost of Glasgow. He was a descendant of the Lordly Dinwiddies of Annandale.

He matriculated at the university in 1707 before starting work as a merchant. Joining the British colonial service in 1727, Dinwiddie was appointed collector of the customs for Bermuda. Following an appointment as surveyor general of customs in southern American ports, Dinwiddie became Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and featured as such in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s nineteenth-century historical novel &quot;The Virginians: A Tale of the Last Century&quot;.

==French and Indian War==

Dinwiddie&#x27;s actions as lieutenant governor are cited by one historian as precipitating the French and Indian War, commonly held to have begun in 1754. He wanted to limit French expansion in Ohio Country, an area claimed by the Virginia Colony and in which the Ohio Company, of which he was a stockholder, had made preliminary surveys and some small settlements. This version of history is disputed when one notices that Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War in Acadia began in 1749 and did not end until the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. In fact, Thomas Jefferys, the Royal Geographer of the day, produced a pamphlet out of his Parliamentary testimony that explained the misconduct of the French in what amounted to a Treaty of Utrecht boundary dispute.

In 1753, Dinwiddie learned the French had built Fort Presque Isle near Lake Erie and Fort Le Boeuf, which he saw as threatening Virginia&#x27;s interests in the Ohio Valley. In fact, he considered Winchester, Virginia, to be &quot;Exposed to the enemy&quot;; Cumberland, Maryland, was only to be fortified the next year.

Dinwiddie sent an eight-man expedition under George Washington to warn the French to withdraw. Washington, then only 21 years old, made the journey in midwinter of 1753–54. Washington arrived at Fort Le Boeuf on 11 December 1753. Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, commandant at Fort Le Boeuf, a tough veteran of the west, received Washington politely, but rejected his ultimatum.

Jacques Saint-Pierre gave Washington three days hospitality at the fort, and then gave Washington a letter for him to deliver to Dinwiddie. The letter conveyed to Dinwiddie that he would send Dinwiddie&#x27;s on to Marquis de Duquesne in Quebec and would meantime maintain his post while he awaited the latter&#x27;s orders.

In January 1754, even before learning of the French refusal to decamp, Dinwiddie sent a small force of Virginia militia to build a fort at the forks of the Ohio River, where the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers merge to form the Ohio (present-day Pittsburgh). The French quickly drove off the Virginians and built a larger fort on the site, calling it Fort Duquesne, in honour of the Marquis de Duquesne, the then-governor of New France.

Dinwiddie named Joshua Fry to the position of Commander-in-Chief of colonial forces. Fry was given command of the Virginia Regiment and was ordered to take Fort Duquesne, then held by the French. During the advance into the Ohio Country, Fry suddenly fell off his horse and died from his injuries on 31 May 1754 at Fort Cumberland, upon which the command of the regiment fell to Washington.

In early spring 1754, Dinwiddie sent Washington to build a road to the Monongahela. After having attacked the French at the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington retreated and built a small stockade, Fort Necessity, at a spot then called &quot;Great Meadows&quot;, by the Youghiogheny River, eleven miles southeast of present-day Uniontown. Here he encountered the French in a skirmish on 3 July 1754 and was forced to surrender. Dinwiddie was subsequently active in rallying other colonies in defense against France and ultimately prevailed upon the British to send General Edward Braddock to Virginia with two regiments of regular troops, in part with a letter to Lord Halifax on 25 October 1754 containing these words:

Braddock met his end at the Battle of Monongahela on 9 July 1755; this unexpected reverse prompted much concern and fear in the colony. Over the next four years, until the defeat of the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec, and Vaudreuil&#x27;s capitulation before Amherst at Montreal, the fate of the 13 colonies was uncertain and Dinwiddie&#x27;s administration was marked by frequent disagreements with the Assembly over the financing of the war. In fact, the friction between the government and the Burgesses would eventually develop into the American Revolution. In January 1758 he left Virginia, to be replaced by Francis Fauquier, and lived in England until his death at Clifton, Bristol.

==Legacy==

Dinwiddie County, Virginia, which lies 30 miles south of Richmond, is named in honor of Robert Dinwiddie. Dinwiddie Hall, since 1972 a dormitory at the College of William &amp; Mary, is also named in honor of Robert Dinwiddie.

Dinwiddie retained his links with his alma mater throughout his life: in 1754 he was conferred an honorary degree by the University of Glasgow; and upon his death in 1770 he gave the University of Glasgow Library £100 for the procurement of books.

Robert Dinwiddie died on 27 July 1770. He is buried in Clifton Parish Church with a monument created by William Tyler RA.

He married some time before 1738 Rebecca Auchinleck (or Afflick); together they had two children Rebecca Dinwiddie and Elizabeth Dinwiddie.

His official records, which were compiled by the Virginia Historical Society in 1883, are left in five volumes. They cover the years of his administration of the Virginia colony, from 1751 to 1758. His archival material resides at several places, and some related to the French and Indian War is visible to web browsers. He was the subject of the book &quot;Robert Dinwiddie: Servant of the Crown&quot;.

<text>Théodore-Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné (, 8 February 155229 April 1630) was a French poet, soldier, propagandist and chronicler. His epic poem &quot;Les Tragiques&quot; (1616) is widely regarded as his masterpiece. In a book about his Catholic contemporary Jean de La Ceppède, the English poet Keith Bosley called d&#x27;Aubigné &quot;the epic poet of the Protestant cause,&quot; during the French Wars of Religion. Bosley added, however, that after d&#x27;Aubigné&#x27;s death, he &quot;was forgotten until the Romantics rediscovered him.&quot;

==Life==
Born at the Château of Saint-Maury, near Pons, in present-day Charente-Maritime, his father was Jean d&#x27;Aubigné, who was involved in the 1560 Huguenot Amboise conspiracy to seize power by staging a palace coup, kidnapping King Francis II of France, and arresting his Catholic advisors. After the defeat of the plot, d&#x27;Aubigné&#x27;s father strengthened his Calvinist sympathies by showing him, while they were passing through Amboise, the heads of the conspirators exposed on the scaffold, and instructing him not to spare his own head in avenging their deaths.

According to the poet&#x27;s own account he knew Latin, Greek and Hebrew at six years of age, and he had translated the &quot;Crito&quot; of Plato before he was eleven.

After a brief residence, d&#x27;Aubigné was forced to flee from Paris to avoid arrest, but was captured and threatened with execution. Escaping through the intervention of a friend, he went to Montargis. In his fourteenth year he was present at the siege of Orléans, at which his father was killed.

In 1567 he made his escape from tutelage, and attached himself to the Huguenot army under Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Condé. Aubigné studied in Paris, Orléans, Geneva (under the tutelage of Theodore Beza) and Lyon before joining the Huguenot Henry of Navarre as both soldier and counsellor. After a furious battle at Casteljaloux, and suffering from fever from his wounds, he wrote &quot;Tragiques&quot; in 1577. He was in the battle of Coutras (1587), and at the Siege of Paris. His career at camp and court, however, was a somewhat chequered one, owing to the roughness of his manner and the keenness of his criticisms, which made him many enemies and severely tried the king&#x27;s patience. In his tragédie-ballet &quot;Circe&quot; (1576) he did not hesitate to indulge in the most outspoken sarcasm against the king and other members of the royal family.

Henry&#x27;s accession to the throne of France required his conversion to the Roman Catholic Church and Aubigné left his service to tend to his own Poitou estates, even though more moderate Huguenots welcomed King Henry&#x27;s decree of religious toleration, the Edict of Nantes. However, d&#x27;Aubigné never entirely lost the favour of the King, who made him governor of Maillezais. d&#x27;Aubigné remained an uncompromising advocate of the Huguenot interests. The first two volumes of the work by which he is best known, his &quot;Histoire universelle depuis 1550 jusqu&#x27;à l&#x27;an 1601&quot;, appeared in 1616 and 1618 respectively.

When Marie de&#x27; Medici became regent following King Henry&#x27;s assassination in 1610, she embraced the Counter-Reformation. The third volume was published in 1619, but, being still more free and personal in its attacks against the Monarchy than those which had preceded it, the book was banned and ordered to be burned by the executioner.

Aubigné was outlawed in 1620 and fled to Geneva where he lived for the rest of his life, though the Queen Mother arranged for a sentence of death to be recorded against him more than once for high treason. Aubigné devoted the period of his exile to study, and supervising the fortifications of Bern and Basel which were designed as a defence of the Republic of Geneva against the Crown of France.

During the 1627–1628 Siege of La Rochelle, the poet&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Constant d&#x27;Aubigné, leaked the plans of King Charles I of England and the Duke of Buckingham to send an English fleet to aid the city&#x27;s Huguenot rebels to Cardinal de Richelieu, the Minister of State to King Louis XIII of France. As a result, Constant d&#x27;Aubigné was disowned and disinherited by his father.

==Legacy==
His daughter, Madame de Villette, was born in 1584 at Mursay to Suzanne de Lusignan de Lezay; at an early age, on 22 October 1610, she married Benjamin Valois de Vilette in Maillezais.

Through Louise, the poet&#x27;s grandson was Philippe, Marquis de Villette-Mursay, who became an Admiral in the French Navy and whose children were, to his outrage, converted to Catholicism by their cousin Madame de Maintenon in 1681.

Several years after being disowned by his father, Constant d&#x27;Aubigné was imprisoned by the Cardinal for corresponding with the English Court. During his imprisonment, Constant married Jeanne de Cardilhac, the daughter of his jailer. All of their children were baptized and raised in the Roman Catholic Church at their mother&#x27;s insistence.

Constant d&#x27;Aubigné&#x27;s daughter and the Poet&#x27;s granddaughter, Françoise d&#x27;Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon, became first the mistress and then the second wife to King Louis XIV of France.

The poet&#x27;s great-granddaughter Françoise Charlotte d&#x27;Aubigné married Adrien Maurice de Noailles, the heir to
the Duke of Noailles, in 1698. Through Françoise, Agrippa d&#x27;Aubigné&#x27;s descendants include Hélie, Duke of Noailles (born 1943), Adrienne de Noailles (1759–1807), who married the famous Marquis de Lafayette, and King Philippe of Belgium (born 1960).

The poet&#x27;s younger son Theodore d&#x27;Aubigné (1613–1670) continued on the d&#x27;Aubigné line.

The members of the d&#x27;Aubigné family who remained Protestant eventually emigrated in the late 1680s and avoided the Monarchy&#x27;s crackdown on Huguenots who remained in France. Later, by 1715, many of them had settled near Falls Church, Virginia, and had changed their name to Dabney.

Since the rediscovery of d&#x27;Aubigné and his poetry by the Romantics, the Huguenot soldier-poet has been translated from Middle French to Polish by Nobel Prize-winning poet Wisława Szymborska and has inspired the English-language poet Ezra Pound.

===&quot;Les Tragiques&quot;===
Written over some three decades, the alexandrine verse of this epic poem relies on multiple genres as well as stylistic familiarity with the work of the opposing, Catholic poets of the Pléiade, headed by Pierre de Ronsard. Divided into seven books, a number symbolic of the author&#x27;s ultimate, apocalyptic intent, the &quot;Tragiques&quot; incorporates literary influence from classical sources, such as tragedy and satire, palpable in the first three books (&quot;&quot;Les Misères&quot;, &quot;Les Princes&quot;, and &quot;La Chambre Dorée&quot; respectively), before resorting to influence from genres like ecclesiastical history, martyrology and apocalypse in the creation of the remaining books (&quot;Les Feux&quot;, &quot;Les Fers&quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot;).

In the first of two liminal paratexts, the introduction &quot;Aux Lecteurs,&quot; Aubigné endorses the account (also found in his autobiographical &quot;&quot;), that the inception of the &quot;Tragiques&quot; came to him as an ecstatic vision during a near-death experience. In the second, &quot;L&#x27;Auteur À Son Livre,&quot; d&#x27;Aubigné adopts the metaphor of father as author to name the text that follows (&quot;Les Tragiques&quot;) as a more pious son than the less religious works of his youth (c.f.: Le Printemps). The intent of the epic is subsequently spelled out as an attack against the Catholic poets of the Pléiade and their patrons in the midst of the religious wars.

<doc id="967093" wikidata="Q6196595" url="?curid=967093" title="Jim Maloway">
<text>Peter James Maloway (born November 10, 1952) is a Canadian politician, who has served as a member of both the House of Commons of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. He is the longest-serving current member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

He originally served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 2008, representing Elmwood for the New Democratic Party of Manitoba. He was then elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the Winnipeg division of Elmwood—Transcona in the 2008 federal election as a member of the New Democratic Party, but was defeated by Conservative candidate Lawrence Toet in the 2011 federal election. He subsequently ran in the 2011 provincial election in his former provincial riding of Elmwood, winning re-election to the provincial legislature.

==Early life and career==
Maloway was born in Sioux Lookout, Ontario, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Manitoba (1975). He later worked for the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission as a liquor inspector, and was executive assistant to the Minister of Colleges and Universities and Tourism. He has owned the Maloway &amp; Eliason Insurance &amp; Travel Centre since 1978, operating it for many years with the late Magnus Eliason.

Maloway was the Returning Officer for the Winnipeg division of Wolseley in the 1973 provincial election. Official results on election night showed a tie between Manitoba Liberal Party leader Izzy Asper and New Democratic Party candidate Murdoch MacKay. Maloway initially cast a tiebreaking vote for MacKay, although a subsequent recount showed Asper elected by four votes.

Maloway joined the New Democratic Party in 1971. He was a candidate for the Winnipeg City Council in 1974 and 1983, and unsuccessfully sought the federal NDP nomination for Winnipeg North Centre in 1984.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==
Maloway was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election over incumbent Russell Doern, a former New Democrat who had left the party two years earlier. The NDP won a narrow majority government under Howard Pawley, and Maloway served as a government backbencher.

The Pawley government was unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in early 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted with the opposition on a motion of non-confidence. Pawley resigned as party leader, but remained premier in a caretaker administration until a new provincial election could be held. Maloway supported Maureen Hemphill&#x27;s bid to succeed Pawley in the leadership contest that followed; she finished fourth against Gary Doer.

The NDP entered the 1988 provincial election very low in the public opinion polls, and some insiders privately worried that the party could lose all of its seats. Maloway narrowly retained the Elmwood division against a strong challenge from the Liberal Party. The Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon won a minority government, while the NDP fell to third-party status. In opposition, Maloway served as his party&#x27;s critic for Consumer and Corporate Affairs, and deputy critic for Finance.

Maloway was an opponent of the Meech Lake Accord, an unsuccessful attempt at constitutional reform that would have delegated powers from the federal government to the provinces and recognized Quebec as a distinct society within Canada. The accord required approval from all ten of Canada&#x27;s provincial legislatures to be passed into law; Maloway supported the decision of fellow NDP MLA Elijah Harper to block the accord&#x27;s passage through procedural tactics, and indicated that he considered taking a similar approach himself.

He was re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Vic Toews. In 1991, he argued that Manitoba should adopt Quebec&#x27;s system of no-fault auto insurance. He also argued that the Public Utilities Board should be given the power to regulate gas prices, in order to prevent price gouging.

Maloway was re-elected by an increased margin in 1995. He criticized the state of Manitoba&#x27;s real estate sector later in the same year, arguing that it was being run in a haphazard manner. He later expressed concern that parts of Manitoba&#x27;s Autopac system would be sold off to the private sector, and accused the Filmon government of privatizing the Manitoba Liquor Control Commission by stealth.

After eleven years in opposition, the New Democratic Party was returned to government in the 1999 provincial election. Maloway was returned in Elmwood without difficulty, and was re-elected again in 2003 and 2007 by significant margins. He sat as a backbench supporter of Gary Doer&#x27;s government, and was described in a 2007 newspaper report as a left-leaning maverick.

Maloway criticized Winnipeg Mayor Glen Murray&#x27;s &quot;New Deal for Winnipeg&quot; in the early 2000s, arguing that the city should correct its own finances instead of appealing for aid from other levels of government. In 2007, he criticized his party&#x27;s decision to abandon its &quot;one member, one vote&quot; method of leadership selection and return to its former model of delegated conventions. He argued that the change would take power away from ordinary party members.

In May 2008, Maloway called on the provincial government to ensure that municipal repairs to the Disraeli Bridge in northeast Winnipeg would be carried out in a way that benefited the public interest. He expressed concern that traffic bottlenecks would occur if the bridge was completely blocked for several months, and called for the bridge to be expanded from four to six lanes. Some municipal politicians criticized this plan, and accused him of opportunism. Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz launched into a personal attack on Maloway during a council debate, for which he was criticized by the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; newspaper.

==Federal politics==
Maloway was among a group of Manitoba MLAs who sought to persuade former Manitoba Premier Edward Schreyer to run for the federal NDP leadership in 1989. He supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to become NDP leader in 1995, and endorsed Bill Blaikie in 2003.

After Blaikie announced his retirement from the House of Commons of Canada in 2007, Maloway indicated he would seek the NDP nomination to succeed him in the federal Elmwood—Transcona riding. He won the nomination over rival candidates Lorene Mahoney and Kevin Rebeck on September 7, 2008. Maloway made the Disraeli bridge his main issue in the 2008 federal election, and was elected over former Winnipeg Jets player Thomas Steen, who had been recruited as a star candidate by the Conservatives. The Conservatives won a minority government nationally, and Maloway was appointed as the NDP Critic for Science and Technology.

Maloway introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill known as the &quot;Airline Passenger&#x27;s Bill of Rights&quot; in February 2009. The bill would require airlines to include hidden fees and taxes in their advertised ticket prices, reimburse passengers who are bumped from overbooked flights by up to $1,200, and provide compensation for passengers who are left stranded on airport tarmacs for long periods of time. It has won the support of consumer advocacy groups, and Maloway has said that it will force airlines to act more responsibly. The National Airlines Council of Canada has opposed the measure, and has said that it will strengthen protection for travelers under an existing federal initiative. Maloway&#x27;s bill narrowly passed second reading in the House of Commons in May 2009. On May 29, 2009, Maloway wrote a guest editorial defending the bill in the &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper.

Maloway has spoken against proposed free trade deals between Canada and the governments of Peru and Colombia.

Maloway was defeated by Conservative candidate Lawrence Toet in the 2011 federal election.

==Return to provincial politics==
Following his defeat in the federal election, Maloway was nominated by the Manitoba NDP in his former seat of Elmwood, to succeed the retiring Bill Blaikie, and is the party&#x27;s candidate in the October 4, 2011 provincial election. He was re-elected in the 2016 and 2019 provincial elections.

<text>Neil Everett Morfitt (born ) is an American sportscaster. From 2007 until 2023, he was the co-anchor of the West Coast edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; alongside Stan Verrett.

==Early life and education==
Everett was born in Portland, Oregon and raised in Spokane, Washington. He was a varsity starter in football and basketball at Lewis and Clark High School, named to the all-city team in football at guard, and also played on the defensive line. He graduated in 1980. 

Everett attended Willamette University in Salem before transferring to the University of Oregon in Eugene and graduated in 1984.

==Career==

Everett started out in broadcasting at KCST-FM in Florence on the central Oregon Coast, west of Eugene. He left the media field and moved to Hawaii, where he worked 15 years as an athletic administrator at Hawaii Pacific University. While still working full-time at HPU, Everett was hired at local ABC affiliate KITV, first as a news writer, then assignment editor, and finally as a sports anchor.

In April 1999, Everett interviewed with ESPN on the recommendation of a friend, but was not hired. The following year, ESPN called him for another audition, and this time he was hired as an anchor on ESPNews. In March 2009, he relocated to California to anchor the late-night Los Angeles edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which debuted on April 6, 2009.

On June 8, 2023, Everett announced that he was leaving ESPN and SportsCenter after 23 years.

==Personal life==
While he was a student at Oregon in 1983, Everett&#x27;s mother Jackie, a high school teacher, died from cancer at age 45.
The use of his middle name as a professional surname is a tribute to his mother, a UO alumna and Astoria native, who would call him by his first and middle name when his behavior was less than optimal.

Everett&#x27;s stepfather, Dave Robertson, was a longtime high school basketball coach at Shadle Park and won the state title in 1981, led on the court by Mark Rypien. A math teacher, Robertson later coached at Gonzaga Prep.

<doc id="967102" wikidata="Q796636" url="?curid=967102" title="BMW N62">
<text>The BMW N62 is a naturally aspirated V8 petrol engine which was used in BMW cars from 2001 to 2010. It also remained in small-scale production for the Morgan Aero until 2019. The N62 is the world&#x27;s first engine to use a continuously variable-length intake manifold, and BMW&#x27;s first V8 to feature variable valve lift (called Valvetronic).

Unlike its predecessor and successor, there was no M version of the N62.

In the International Engine of the Year awards in 2002, the N62 was awarded &quot;International Engine of the Year&quot;, &quot;Best New Engine&quot; and &quot;Above 4-litre&quot; categories.

== Design ==
The N62 was a clean sheet design and not a direct evolution of the M60 engine line that evolved into the M62 engine. The N62 4.4L has a bore of and stroke of for a total displacement of 4,398cc and features double-VANOS variable valve timing on both the intake and exhaust camshafts (the M62 features variable valve timing on only the intake camshaft). As per the M62, the N62 has double overhead camshafts (DOHC) with four valves per cylinder, an aluminium engine block and an aluminium cylinder head. The N62 4.4 featured offset fracture-split forged powdered metal connecting rods and it was also the first V8 and only the second BMW engine to feature Valvetronic technology which on the N62 varies the valve lift of the engine from .03mm to 9.85mm. The redline is 6500 rpm. Valvetronic technology allows for variable valve timing, variable lift and variable duration and the N62 adjusts the lift instead of utilizing the throttle body during normal operation. The engine does feature a throttle body but this is only used for emergency applications in the event of Valvetronic failure, for certain cold start conditions and to maintain a set amount of vacuum in the intake during low load conditions such as cruising on the highway or idling. The vacuum pump mounted on the bank 1 cylinder head only supplies the brake booster and certain auxiliaries with vacuum, making the use of the standard TB for manifold vacuum control a requirement for proper functioning of the crankcase ventilation system as well as the fuel evap valve and other emissions related systems.

The N62B44 is the only production engine in the world to feature a continuously variable length intake manifold known as the DIVA intake (not to be confused with the DISA intake as used on many other BMW production engines). The intake length path begins to shorten at 3,500 RPM and is progressively shortened until it reaches its shortest length at the engine&#x27;s redline. This maximizes torque throughout the RPM range, producing a much broader torque curve and more peak HP.

Applications:
* 2004-2005 BMW 5 Series (E60) 545i
* 2004-2005 BMW 6 Series (E63) 645Ci
* 2001-2004 BMW 7 Series (E65) 745i/745Li
* 2004-2006 BMW X5 (E53) X5 4.4i and 4.8is

The N62B48 engine used in the E53 X5 4.8is was a 4.8L variant of the N62B44 which was accomplished by way of an increased bore size to and stroke to which increased the displacement to 4798.52 cc. The N62B48 in the E53 shared other components with the N62B44 including the DIVA intake which was replaced when the engine was evolved to the N62TU. The oil pan was modified and deepened to account for the longer stroke crankshaft, this change was applied to all N62&#x27;s in October 2003 which includes the 4.4 variants in production at the time. Other changes were also made to accommodate the longer stroke crankshaft such as more traditional non-offset connecting rods.

The N62 was evolved into the N62TU beginning in model year 2005 and the 4.4 was replaced with the 4.8 variant by using the same bore and stroke from the 4.8 version in the E53 4.8is. The N62TU featured several changes over the N62B44, including different exhaust manifolds, improved catalytic converters, new pre-cat oxygen sensors, new MAF, updated engine management unit, replacement of the DIVA continuously variable length intake manifold to a DISA two-stage manifold, removal of secondary air injection ports and different heads to accomdate this change and the increased bore, different spark plugs and inlet and exhaust valves with a stem diameter decreased to 5mm from 6mm.

<text>John Paul Hammerschmidt (May 4, 1922 – April 1, 2015) was an American politician from the state of Arkansas. A Republican, Hammerschmidt served thirteen terms in the United States House of Representatives for Arkansas&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, located in the northwestern quadrant of the state. He served from 1967 until his retirement in 1993.

In 1974, a nationally Democratic year, he secured his fifth term by defeating the then 28-year-old Bill Clinton. He was also the first Republican elected to the House of Representatives from Arkansas since Reconstruction. Coincidentally, Hammerschmidt left the House the same month in which Clinton became president.

==Early life and business career==
Born in Harrison in Boone County in northwestern Arkansas, Hammerschmidt was the fourth of five children of the former Junie Mildred Taylor and Arthur Paul Hammerschmidt. Both sets of grandparents migrated to Boone County in the early years of the 20th century and were of German descent. He graduated in 1938 from Harrison High School.

He attended The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, from 1938 to 1939 and the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville from 1940 to 1941.

Hammerschmidt served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II. In 1942, he joined the 3rd Combat Cargo Group of the U.S. Army Air Corps and served in the China-Burma-India theater until the end of the war in 1945. Hammerschmidt received the Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak leaf clusters for his service in the war.

Hammerschmidt returned to the United States and attended Oklahoma A&amp;M College (now Oklahoma State University) in Stillwater, Oklahoma, from 1945 to 1946, having received a Bachelor of Science degree. He then entered the lumber industry, working at the Hammerschmidt Lumber Company, which had been founded by his grandfather, and becoming its president. Hammerschmidt also was president of the Construction Products Company and the Arkansas Lumber Dealers Association and Southwestern Lumberman&#x27;s Association.

Hammerschmidt continued his military service in the United States Air Force Reserves from 1945 to 1960, and later in the District of Columbia Army Reserves from 1977 to 1981.

==Political career==
Hammerschmidt was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980, 1984, and 1988. He was twice the state chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, serving from 1964 to 1966 and again from 2002 to 2004.

In the 1966 election, Hammerschmidt won the Republican nomination for the 3rd district and then defeated 11-term incumbent Democrat James William Trimble, by more than nine thousand votes. He became the first Republican to represent Arkansas in Congress since Reconstruction. Hammerschmidt was elected twelve more times, having served twenty-six years from January 3, 1967 to January 3, 1993, from the 90th Congress to the 102nd Congress. The 3rd district had begun shaking off its Solid South roots before the rest of Arkansas; it has only supported a Democrat for president twice since 1952, and its voters had begun splitting their tickets at the federal level as early as the 1930s.
Hammerschmidt became very popular in the 3rd district, even though most of its residents had never been represented by a Republican before; indeed, Democrats would hold most state and local offices well into the 1990s. He only faced one contest anywhere near as close as his initial bid for the seat. In the 1974 election, he defeated Bill Clinton (then a University of Arkansas law professor) by only 6,400 votes. Clinton had harshly criticized Hammerschmidt for being one of the few Republicans to stand by Richard Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal. This election was one of only four in which Democrats received more than one-third of the vote against Hammerschmidt, the others being Hardy Croxton in 1968, Donald Poe in 1970, and former Clinton associate James McDougal in 1982. The district reverted to form in 1976, when Hammerschmidt was reelected unopposed. In 1978, Hammerschmidt faced weak opposition from the Hot Springs real estate broker William C. Mears and instead had the resources to help the Republican gubernatorial nominee, A. Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana, win in Boone County. Lowe, who was also the state party chairman, lost to Hammerschmidt&#x27;s former opponent, Bill Clinton, by an margin of 63-37.

Hammerschmidt was a member of the President&#x27;s Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) which was organized in September 1989 to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of Pan Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.

Hammerschmidt had a conservative voting record on foreign policy and social issues, but a slightly more moderate record on economic issues. He supported a constitutional amendment proposing to enact flag desecration laws.

Hammerschmidt was in the Air Force Reserve from 1945 to 1960 and the Army Reserve from 1977 to 1981. He was a Presbyterian and a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Freemasons, Shriners, Elks, Rotary International, and had alumni status at the Alpha Zeta chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. From 1999 to 2004, he was a trustee of Arkansas State University at Jonesboro. Hammerschmidt died at the age of 92 of heart and respiratory failure at a hospital in Springdale, Arkansas.

==Legacy==

A fellowship at the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith was created in his name to allow a university student to work in the 3rd congressional district office.

The John Paul Hammerschmidt Federal Building near the Fayetteville Historic Square is home to the Fayetteville office of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas.

Interstate 49 in Arkansas is designated as the John Paul Hammerschmidt Highway in northwest Arkansas.

Hammerschmidt was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1990 by the Arkansas Aviation Historical Society.

<text>GGP Inc. (an initialism of General Growth Properties) was an American commercial real estate company and the second-largest shopping mall operator in the United States. It was founded by brothers Martin, Matthew and Maurice Bucksbaum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1954, and was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, from 2000. It was subject to the largest real estate bankruptcy in American history at the time of its filing in 2009.

GGP was acquired by Brookfield Property Partners, and management of its portfolio was transferred to Brookfield Properties, in 2018. Its portfolio included 125 properties comprising approximately in 40 U.S. states at the time of its acquisition, ranking behind only Simon Property Group in total square footage.

==History==
===20th century===
General Growth was founded in Iowa by three brothers, Martin, Matthew and Maurice Bucksbaum, in 1954 as General Management. That year, they borrowed $1.2 million to develop their first shopping center, Town &amp; Country Shopping Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in order to open a fourth location for the grocery store founded by their father.

By 1964, the company owned five malls and moved its headquarters to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1970, General Management became General Growth Properties (GGP) and became a public company via an initial public offering. In 1984, the company sold its holdings to Equitable Real Estate Investment Management for $800 million in the largest-ever single-asset real estate transaction to date, but retained the property management of the assets. In 1989, the company acquired Center Companies, creating the fourth-largest shopping center management company in the United States.

In 1993, the company once again became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $400 million. In 1994, the company purchased a 40% interest in Centermark Properties from Prudential Financial. In 1995, the company sold 25% of its 40% stake, yielding a profit of over $100 million. In 1995, the company also purchased the Homart Development Company from Sears for $1.85 billion. In 1995, co-founder and CEO Martin Bucksbaum died and the company moved its headquarters from Des Moines to Chicago. In 1999, John Bucksbaum succeeded his father as CEO.

===21st century===

In 2000, the company moved its headquarters from Des Moines to Chicago. The company occupied a historic building on North Wacker Drive designed by architectural firm Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, that was later demolished. In 2004, the company acquired The Rouse Company, which owned 37 regional shopping malls and Howard Hughes Corporation, a land development company, for $7.2 billion in cash. By 2008, the company had taken on $25 billion in debt and the company was facing required debt payments. John Bucksbaum was ousted as CEO, though he remained chairman of the board, and Adam Metz was named CEO. In December 2008, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman disclosed a 25% ownership stake in the company.

In 2009, the company missed a deadline to repay $900 million in loans backed by two Las Vegas properties, putting the company in danger of filing for bankruptcy protection. At that point, the stock price was down 98% in 12 months. The Bucksbaum family&#x27;s stake in the firm, which was worth $2.5 billion in 2005, had declined in value by a similar amount. On April 16, 2009, the company filed one of the largest real estate bankruptcies ever and received $375 million in debtor-in-possession financing from Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund managed by Bill Ackman. In February 2010, Brookfield Asset Management made a $2.625 billion equity investment in the company. In November 2010, the company exited bankruptcy protection. Creditors were paid in full and equity holders made a &quot;substantial&quot; recovery of their investment, both of which are unusual in bankruptcy filings. In conjunction with the reorganization, the company spun off Howard Hughes Corporation to its shareholders.

In December 2010, CEO Adam Metz and President and COO Thomas Nolan left the company and Sandeep Mathrani, formerly the head of the retail division of Vornado Realty Trust, was named CEO. In 2011, the company sold Faneuil Hall for $140 million. In January 2012, the company completed the spin off of Rouse Properties to its shareholders. In 2013, co-founder Matthew Bucksbaum died. In February 2014, Bill Ackman sold his remaining shares in the company back to the company for $556 million. In April 2015, the company acquired the Crown Building for $1.78 billion. In January 2017, the company changed its name to GGP Inc.

==2018 acquisition by Brookfield Property Partners==
On August 28, 2018, GGP was acquired by Brookfield Property Partners and management of its former portfolio was transferred to its Brookfield Properties subsidiary for $9 billion in cash. The transaction reunited the malls spun off in the Rouse Properties spinoff with the GGP malls. Upon closing the acquisition, Brookfield immediately sold a 49% interest in each of three former GGP super-regional malls to CBRE Group, and a 49% interest in three other former GGP malls to TIAA subsidiary Nuveen, seeking additional joint ventures for its newly-acquired malls.

<doc id="967132" wikidata="Q4725977" url="?curid=967132" title="Alice M. Ward Library">
<text>The Alice M. Ward Library is the public library serving Canaan, Essex County, Vermont. It is located at 27 Park St., in a former stagecoach inn, historically known as Jacobs Stand, built in 1846. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

== Building history and architecture ==
Built in 1846 by Fernando C. Jacobs as an inn or &#x27;stand&#x27;, the building was the northernmost stop on the stage route to Montreal, Quebec, Canada East. Due to Jacob&#x27;s known stance against slavery, local folklore considers the building to be the former northernmost U.S. stop on the Connecticut River route of the 19th century Underground Railroad. However, there is no evidence supporting the theory. The building was sold in 1888 to physician Artemas Ward and later bequest to the town of Canaan as a public library in 1930 after the death of his wife Alice. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its distinctive Neo-Palladian temple-form design.

The library stands on the west side of the triangular town common in the center of Canaan village, near the southern end of Park Street where it meets Vermont Route 102. The building is a -story timber-framed structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The gable faces the street, and projects over a recessed porch, which has round Ionic columns for support. Recessed into the gable on the attic level is a rounded second-story porch area, giving the front its Palladian form. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and is topped by a corniced entablature. The interior retains period Federal style woodwork, including a particularly fine central staircase.

== Services ==
According to 2000 Census figures as reported by the Vermont Department of Libraries, the Alice M. Ward Library serves a population of 1078, with a staff of two. While located in Canaan, it offers free library cards to all patrons, including seasonal visitors and those from neighboring towns. The Canaan Historical Society uses the top floor of the library for historical displays and public activities.

The library offers 24-hour wireless DSL Internet access and offers 4 computers for public use. It does not use content filtering. The library offers nontraditional items for public circulation, including snowshoes, a typewriter, cameras, craft items and Dremels. Other electronics, including a Sphero and Samsung Galaxy Tab 4s, are available for in-library use or used in library programming. Additionally, there is an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset available for use of the public. The library was reported in 2016 as meeting all state standards. In 2018 the library began an oral history project with a particular focus on the Ethan Allen factory in Beecher Falls.

== Educational programs ==
The Alice Ward Library offers several educational programs for a variety of ages year-round. The library has a multitude of STEM-focused opportunities, such as a regularly meeting technology club. The library also runs a FIRST Lego League team as well as a FIRST Tech Challenge team.

One interpretation of the word &quot;Kachemak&quot; is &quot;Smokey Bay&quot; which supposedly is from an Alutiiq word describing the smoldering coal seams that used to fill the bay with smoke.

==Features==

Kachemak Bay is home to Alaska&#x27;s only state wilderness park, Kachemak Bay State Park. Kachemak Bay State park was the first state park in Alaska. There is no road access to most of the park; visitors must arrive by airplane or boat.

Kachemak Bay is also home to the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, the largest reserve in the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. It is a very active site of research and education. The bay hosts a remarkably high level of biological activity, due in part to water circulation patterns which keep shellfish larvae and nutrients in the bay. While surface waters push nutrients out into the bay, ocean currents push them back into the bay, creating a very fertile environment. Both fish and shellfish are abundant in the bay, year-round. Waterfowl and shorebirds occupy the bay during all but the winter season, while water birds and marine mammals including otters, seals, porpoise, and whales remain in the bay all year. The bay provides winter homes for 90% of the seabird and waterfowl populations of Lower Cook Inlet. Moose, coyote, and bears are frequently seen in warmer months.

The tides at Kachemak Bay are extreme, with an average vertical difference (also called mean range) of , and recorded extremes of as measured at the Seldovia Tide Station. The highest tide on record is above MLLW (mean lower low water) and occurred on November 15, 1966. The lowest tide on record is from MLLW and occurred on April 27, 2002.

<text>The Dean Forest Railway is a long heritage railway that runs between Lydney and Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire.

The route was part of the former Severn and Wye Railway which ran from Lydney to Cinderford. The society that operates the line started steam locomotive operations in 1971, and bought the trackbed and line from British Rail in 1986, reaching Lydney Junction in 1995 and Parkend in 2005. Trains are operated by both steam and heritage diesel locomotives, and heritage diesel multiple units.

The Dean Forest Railway has been given the former Panteg and Griffithstown railway station building. Its removal was completed in June 2016, and is expected to be placed at the new upcoming Speech House Road.

CrossCountry are now providing a combined fare for travel to Lydney mainline station (on CrossCountry services only) and then onto the Dean Forest Railway.

The Dean Forest Railway plans to extend its heritage services a further through/into the middle of the Royal Forest at Speech House Road (close to the nearby Beechenhurst Visitor Attraction), bringing the line to a total of about in length. In 2016, DFR&#x27;s director of civil engineering and director of development Jason Shirley announced plans to expand the railway to Cinderford. The project&#x27;s status as a strategic regional development means that a large proportion of the estimated £8million cost could be met by Government funding.

<doc id="967139" wikidata="Q334381" url="?curid=967139" title="Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell">
<text>Edward Cardwell, 1st Viscount Cardwell, (24 July 1813 – 15 February 1886) was a prominent British politician in the Peelite and Liberal parties during the middle of the 19th century. He is best remembered for his tenure as Secretary of State for War between 1868 and 1874 and, with William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s support, the introduction of the Cardwell Reforms. The goal was to centralise the power of the War Office, abolish purchase of officers&#x27; commissions, and to create reserve forces stationed in Britain by establishing short terms of service for enlisted men.

==Background and education==
Cardwell was the son of John Henry Cardwell, of Liverpool, a merchant, and Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Birley. He was educated at Winchester and Balliol College, Oxford, from where he took a degree in 1835. He was called to the bar, Inner Temple, in 1838.

== Early political career==
Cardwell was employed in the Colonial Office in the late 1830s, and directly involved in drafting written instructions (sent to Sydney) to Captain William Hobson RN, as to how to &#x27;treat with the natives&#x27; (Maori) of New Zealand;

 He became a follower and confidant of Sir Robert Peel, the Prime Minister, and held his first office under him as Financial Secretary to the Treasury between 1845 and 1846. 

When Peel split the Conservative Party in 1846 over the issue of repealing the Corn Laws, Cardwell followed Peel, and became a member of the Peelite faction. When the Peelites came to power in 1852, Cardwell was sworn of the Privy Council and made President of the Board of Trade by Lord Aberdeen, a position he held until 1855. 

In 1854 he passed the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854 which stopped the cut-throat competition between Railway Companies which was acting to their and the railusers&#x27; disadvantage.

== Reelection and return ==
During these years, Cardwell moved from seat to seat in Parliament. In 1847, he was elected as MP for Liverpool. 

In 1852, he lost elections for Liverpool and for Ayrshire, but won a seat at Oxford. In 1857, he was defeated for the Oxford seat, but a second election for the seat was held shortly after, which he won (beating William Makepeace Thackeray). 

== Liberal MP ==
By this point, The Peelite faction disintegrated in the late 1850s and have fully integrated with the Whigs. The dissenting factions of the former Tory party and the Whig party combined to found the Liberal Party (UK) and Cardwell officially became a new member of the new Liberal Party in 1859. 

=== Palmerston government ===
Cardwell quickly return to office by joining Lord Palmerston&#x27;s cabinet as Chief Secretary for Ireland. 

Unhappy in that position, he moved two years later to another cabinet post, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. A second move within the cabinet came in 1864, when Cardwell became the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a position he kept until the Liberals were turned out of office in 1866.

=== Gladstone government ===
When the Liberals returned to power under William Ewart Gladstone in the 1868 election, Cardwell reached the peak of his career, as Gladstone&#x27;s Secretary of State for War. 
During his six years in the post, in what became known as &quot;Cardwell reforms&quot;, Cardwell reorganised the British army, introduced professional standards for officers (including advancement by merit rather than purchase), and formed a home reserve force.
After Gladstone&#x27;s defeat in the 1874 election, Cardwell was raised to the peerage as Viscount Cardwell, of Ellerbeck in the County Palatine of Lancaster. His ennoblement ended his active political career.

====Army reform====

Liberal prime minister William Ewart Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870 he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. Germany&#x27;s stunning triumph over France proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used. 
The reforms were not radical—they had been brewing for years and Gladstone seized the moment to enact them. The goal was to centralise the power of the War Office, abolish purchase of officers&#x27; commissions, and to create reserve forces stationed in Britain by establishing short terms of service for enlisted men.

Cardwell as Secretary of State for War (1868–1874) designed the reforms that Gladstone supported in the name of efficiency and democracy. In 1868 he abolished flogging, raising the private soldier status to more like an honourable career. In 1870 Cardwell abolished &quot;bounty money&quot; for recruits, discharged known bad characters from the ranks. He pulled 20,000 soldiers out of self-governing colonies like Canada, which learned they had to help defend themselves.

The most radical change, and one that required Gladstone&#x27;s political muscle, was to abolish the system of officers obtaining commissions and promotions by purchase, rather than by merit. The system meant that the rich landholding families controlled all the middle and senior ranks in the army. Promotion depended on the family&#x27;s wealth, not the officer&#x27;s talents, and the middle class was shut out almost completely. 
British officers were expected to be gentlemen and sportsmen; there was no problem if they were entirely wanting in military knowledge or leadership skills. From the Tory perspective it was essential to keep the officer corps the domain of gentlemen, and not a trade for professional experts. They warned the latter might menace the oligarchy and threaten a military coup; they preferred an inefficient army to an authoritarian state. The rise of Bismarck&#x27;s new Germany made this anti authoritarian policy too dangerous for a great empire to risk.

The bill, which would have compensated current owners for their cash investments, passed Commons in 1871 but was blocked by the House of Lords. Gladstone then moved to drop the system without any reimbursements, forcing the Lords to backtrack and approve the original bill. Liberals rallied to Gladstone&#x27;s anti-elitism, pointing to the case of Lord Cardigan (1797–1868), who spent £40,000 for his commission and proved utterly incompetent in the Crimean war, where he led the disastrous &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; at the Battle of Balaklava in 1854.

Cardwell was not powerful enough to install a general staff system; that had to await the 20th century. He did rearrange the war department. He made the office of Secretary of State for War superior to the Army&#x27;s commander in Chief; the commander was His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge, the Queen&#x27;s first cousin, and an opponent of the reforms. The surveyor-general of the ordnance, and the financial secretary became key department heads reporting to the Secretary. The militia was reformed as well and integrated into the Army. The term of enlistment was reduced to 6 years, so there was more turnover and a larger pool of trained reservists. The territorial system of recruiting for regiments was standardised and adjusted to the current population. Cardwell reduced the Army budget yet increased the strength of the army by 25 battalions, 156 field guns, and abundant stores, while the reserves available for foreign service had been raised tenfold from 3,500 to 36,000 men.

==Personal life==
Lord Cardwell married Annie, daughter of Charles Stuart Parker, in 1838. They had no children. 

He died in Torquay, Devon, in February 1886, aged 72, and was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery (plot no.14065) in a large vault which now has no headstone and is largely covered by earth. Lady Cardwell died the following year, in February 1887. 

The town of Cardwell in Queensland, Australia, was named after Lord Cardwell.

He owned .

<text>Hurricane Allen was the strongest Atlantic hurricane by wind speed on record. An extremely powerful tropical cyclone, Allen affected the Caribbean, eastern and northern Mexico, and South Texas in August 1980. The second tropical depression, first named storm, and first hurricane of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Allen was the sixth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record in terms of barometric pressure. It was one of the few hurricanes to reach Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale on three occasions, and spent more time at Category 5 status than all but two other Atlantic hurricanes. Allen is the only hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic basin to achieve sustained winds of 190 mph (305 km/h), Until Hurricane Patricia in 2015, these were also the highest sustained winds in the Western Hemisphere. Hurricane Allen was also the third strongest tropical cyclone to exist in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of pressure, behind hurricanes Milton and Rita in 2024 and 2005, respectively.

Throughout its life, Allen moved through the deep tropics on a westerly to northwesterly course through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico before making its final landfall near the United States–Mexico border. At peak strength, it passed near Haiti, causing hundreds of deaths and heavy damage. After crossing the Gulf of Mexico, Allen weakened as it struck the lower Texas coast, causing high winds, a significant storm surge, and heavy rainfall, which caused damage to South Texas. Overall, Allen killed at least 281 people and left $1.57 billion in damages (1980 US dollars), mostly in Haiti and the United States. Due to the hurricane&#x27;s impact, the name &quot;Allen&quot; was retired from the six-year revolving list of Atlantic tropical cyclone names in 1981 and replaced by &quot;Andrew&quot;. The remnants of the storm caused a brief lapse in the heat wave of 1980 in places like Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, which had recorded 69 days of heat.

== Meteorological history ==

Allen was an early-season Cape Verde-type hurricane, originating from a tropical wave that left the African coastline on July 30. The system developed quickly as it moved westward, becoming a tropical depression the following day. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories on Allen until almost 24 hours later, when it was centered east of the Windward Islands. Early on August 2, as the depression moved quickly westward towards the Caribbean, it intensified into the first named storm of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season. Allen rapidly strengthened as it continued westward. By the time an aircraft reconnaissance plane entered the tropical cyclone&#x27;s center late on August 3, it had already achieved major hurricane status, with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum central pressure of , making Allen a Category 3 hurricane. The storm&#x27;s central pressure dropped to that night as its eye passed north of Barbados on August 4.
Allen continued to move quickly westward and entered the Caribbean Sea shortly after passing south of St. Lucia. Allen&#x27;s rapid intensification continued during this time, as it was steered by a mid- to upper-level ridge to its north. Shortly before 0000 UTC on August 5, the hurricane&#x27;s minimum pressure decreased to , which was noted as equivalent to Hurricane David in the previous season. Another reconnaissance aircraft shortly thereafter discovered Allen had become an extremely strong Category 5 hurricane, with sustained winds of and a minimum pressure of the following day. This was the lowest central pressure ever recorded in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Allen maintained its extreme intensity for most of the day. However, late on August 5, the storm began to weaken as it underwent an eyewall replacement cycle and interacted with the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola, with the storm taking a northwestward jog south of the island, a common track deviation for most hurricanes that have passed through the area.

Allen resumed a more westward course as it left behind Hispaniola and passed north of Jamaica and the Cayman Islands on August 6. The very warm waters of the northwestern Caribbean Sea allowed the storm to begin another phase of rapid intensification. Allen reached its second and greatest peak intensity on the afternoon of August 7, with maximum sustained winds of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Allen had the highest maximum sustained winds ever recorded in an Atlantic hurricane. Its minimum pressure of 899 millibars was the second-lowest pressure on record for the basin at the time. The major hurricane was also very large at this time, with hurricane-force winds extending from its center and tropical-storm-force winds extending 345 miles. Allen&#x27;s circulation filled nearly the entire Gulf of Mexico, and was regarded at the time as the second-largest Atlantic hurricane on record, after 1961&#x27;s Hurricane Carla. Continuing westward, the southern portion of Allen&#x27;s circulation passed over the Yucatán Peninsula, causing the cyclone to weaken again. Allen bottomed out with winds of on August 8. Continued movement west over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed Allen to restrengthen into a Category 5 hurricane for a third time as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf. The hurricane&#x27;s central pressure dropped back to a tertiary low of . Pressure falls over the southern United States at this time indicated Allen would soon slow its forward motion as it approached Texas. Allen&#x27;s forward speed slowed considerably in the hours before it made landfall near Brownsville as a low-end Category 3 major hurricane on August 10. The storm rapidly weakened as it moved inland, eventually dissipating over the mountainous terrain of northern Mexico the following day.

== Preparations ==

As Allen approached the Caribbean Sea, gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the islands of Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Dominica, Grenada, Martinique, and Guadeloupe during the daylight hours of August 3. Gale warnings were in effect for Antigua from 11 am on August 3 until 11 am on August 4. Hurricane warnings were raised for Barbados, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica from the early afternoon of August 3 until the late morning of August 4. As Allen moved into the Caribbean sea, hurricane watches were issued for southeastern sections of the Dominican Republic and the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from 11 am on August 4 until the morning of August 5. Gale warnings were then in effect for the southern Dominican Republic from the night of August 4 into the night of August 5, while southern Haiti maintained the warnings from the night of August 4 into the morning of August 5. The hurricane watch was issued for Jamaica during the morning hours of August 5, while hurricane warnings were raised for the southwest peninsula of Haiti from the late morning of August 5 into the morning of August 6. Hurricane warnings went into effect for Jamaica from around noon on August 5 until late in the afternoon of August 6. The Cayman Islands saw hurricane watches issued from the afternoon of August 5 into the morning of August 6 before the watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings from the morning until late afternoon of August 6.

As Allen approached the Gulf of Mexico, hurricane warnings were raised for the northeast Yucatán peninsula of Mexico from the afternoon of August 6 into the morning of August 8. Gale warnings were in effect for the Florida Keys from the evening of August 6 into the early morning of August 8. As Allen approached its final landfall, the northeast Mexican coast and Texas coast were placed under a hurricane watch from the morning of August 8 until the morning of August 9 for Mexico and the afternoon of August 9 for Texas. Hurricane warnings were posted for the Texas coast during the afternoon of August 8, and were lowered north of Freeport, Texas during the afternoon of August 9 and south of Freeport during the afternoon of August 10. Gale warnings and a hurricane watch were issued for the Louisiana coast from Vermilion Bay westward from the afternoon of August 8 into the afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were in effect for northeast Mexico from the early afternoon of August 9 into the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings between High Island, Texas and Freeport, Texas between the late afternoon of August 9 and the late afternoon of August 10. Hurricane watches were dropped for the Louisiana coast during the late afternoon of August 9. Hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings for the lower Texas coast south of Freeport from the late afternoon of August 10 into the early morning of August 11.

In addition to the various watches and warnings put in place ahead of Allen&#x27;s arrival, various international governments took measures to prepare for the hurricane in Haiti. A disaster committee and executive committee to address the aftermath of the storm was formed by Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier, the latter of which was headed by members of the Haitian Ministry of Health and Hatian Red Cross, while members of the committees included representatives from the army, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and others. Emergency instructions were issued by the Haitian government to prevent possible increases in malaria cases following Allen&#x27;s passage. The United States government made preparations to send personnel, as well as financial and aerial assistance, to Haiti. In neighboring Cuba, over 200,000 people across seven provinces were evacuated.

Tens of thousands of people evacuated the Texas coast before Allen&#x27;s landfall, and forecasters advised that all areas within one mile of the coastline be cleared. The American Red Cross opened 109 shelters across Hidalgo County and in the city of Corpus Christi. Access to Padre Island National Seashore was cut off, and all visitors there and residents of Galveston Island were ordered to evacuate the respective areas. Six thousand people in lower Cameron Parish, Louisiana, 14,000 people in Port Lavaca, and additional residents of the low-lying suburbs of Houston, Texas were ordered to evacuate as well. A total of 2,500 troops were put on alert in Texas prior to the storm&#x27;s passage.

== Impact ==

Allen caused just over $1 billion (1980 USD) in damages and killed at least 281 people throughout its course (including indirect deaths).

=== Caribbean ===
The island of St. Lucia sustained catastrophic damage from Allen when it was a strong category 3 hurricane. Sustained winds of and a sea level pressure as low as were reported at Hewanorra. A total of $235 million in damage was incurred on the island. The country&#x27;s banana crop was devastated, and its main hospital, Victoria Hopsital, was left powerless and with part of its roof missing. Much of St. Lucia&#x27;s telephone lines and other communications were down due to the storm, and foreign governments communicated with the island via ham radio. Eighteen people lost their lives as a result of the storm&#x27;s passage. One death in Guadeloupe was attributed to Allen. 

In Barbados, damages were estimated to be $6 million (1980 USD) by local officials, mostly to agriculture, housing and the local fishing industry. The highest recorded winds on the island were 68 knots () on its south side, though Allen likely brought much stronger winds of greater than 100 knots () on the northern part of Barbados under the eyewall of the hurricane. About 500 houses were either damaged or destroyed. No deaths were reported. 20 small boats were destroyed on the island and another 75 sustained damage. In Martinique, damage was extensive as the storm passed south of the island. Waves high battered the coast of the island during the storm. Torrential rainfall caused damage to agriculture on Saint Vincent. Despite being located away from Allen&#x27;s center as it passed to the south, Puerto Rico saw wind gusts of up to due to the hurricane.

In the central Caribbean, Cayman Brac was hit by winds in excess of which caused considerable property damage. A coral reef at Discovery Bay, Jamaica was devastated by the intense waves from the storm. Offshore Jamaica, greater numbers of smaller-sized Damselfishes were witnessed in the wake of Allen. Much of the capital city Kingston was left without power. Wind speeds of occurred along Jamaica&#x27;s northern coast where Allen made its closest approach to the island. Storm surge and strong waves along Jamaica&#x27;s northeastern coast damaged buildings, and to inches of rainfall was recorded. Eight deaths in Jamaica occurred due to Allen. Three additional deaths were attributed to Allen in Cuba. Citrus and tobacco crops were ruined on Isla de la Juventud. 25,000 exchange students were stuck on the island during Allen&#x27;s passage. Additional coffee and banana crops across the Caribbean were devastated by the hurricane.

Extensive damage occurred in Haiti due to high winds and flash flooding. Total costs for that country were estimated to be at more than $400 million (1980 USD). 2.5 million people were affected by the storm, with an estimated 333,000 people considered at risk for food shortage. Roughly 60% of the nation&#x27;s coffee crop was destroyed. In Port-au-Prince, Allen caused many fallen trees, local flooding, and temporary disruptions to electric power and telephone services. The island of Île-à-Vache had its food supply depleted and its entire water supply contaminated with salt water. At least 140 bodies were recovered from rural areas of the country in the wake of the storm. In all, 220 people were killed and 835,000 were left homeless by the catastrophic flooding and wind damage Allen caused in Haiti.

=== United States ===

In Texas, the storm surge was reported as high as at Port Mansfield, though it may have been higher elsewhere along the Texas coast. A peak wind gust of was also measured at Port Mansfield. Tropical storm-force winds in Corpus Christi, Texas blew roof gravel through the city, which led to substantial glass breakage to the 18-story Guarantee Bank Building and a 12-story wing of Spohn hospital. Allen dumped of rain in south Texas along a 50 to 100 mile swath of land from the coast inland, ending a summer-long drought during the Heat Wave of 1980. The Nueces River peaked at , above flood level.

The storm caused seven deaths in Texas and 17 in Louisiana, most in the latter state resulting from the crash of a helicopter evacuating workers from an offshore oil platform. Allen spawned several tornadoes in Texas; a total of 29 were reported in association with the hurricane. One tornado caused an estimated $50 million in damage when it hit an airport in Austin, Texas. Two offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico were destroyed by Allen, and 13 people died in the aforementioned helicopter crash during the evacuation of a rig. A total of $600 million in damage was recorded in Texas due to Allen. Overall, however, the storm caused less damage than initially feared in the United States due to its suddenly diminished power, as well as its highest tides and winds hitting a sparsely populated portion of the Texas coast.

=== Elsewhere ===
Areas of northeastern Mexico saw heavy rains with the passage of Allen, with the highest totals exceeding . The hurricane earlier brushed the Yucatán Peninsula. As Allen only affected sparsely populated regions of Mexico, there were no reports of significant damage. The Panamanian freighter &quot;Georgios G&quot; went missing on August 5 on the way to Belize City with 25 people aboard. While information on the ship&#x27;s fate is incomplete, it was likely intercepted by Allen on its course.

== Aftermath ==
In the aftermath of Allen, the United States Department of Defense announced it would be providing aid to St. Lucia, Haiti and Jamaica. A C-130 cargo plane delivered humanitarian supplies and radios to St. Lucia. Two helicopters flew to the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince and three reconnaissance aircraft were sent to Jamaica, all for damage surveys. Haitian President Jean-Claude Duvalier declared Haiti&#x27;s Tiburon Peninsula a disaster area. A network of ham radios was utilized to communicate with isolated victims of the hurricane across the eastern Caribbean. The Haitian Red Cross coordinated aid with other regional Red Crosses, needing supplies and food to support 50,000 people affected by Allen. Seeds were distributed to small farm owners to allow for the quick replant of crops lost in the storm. An island off the coast of Haiti with around 7,000 residents in need of urgent aid was reached by the USAID mission, bringing support personnel as well as sump pumps and water purification units to clean wells contaminated by salt water. US helicopters transported a total of 108,123 pounds of relief supplies and 10,793 gallons of water to Haiti; following this, all Department of Defense officials withdrew from the country by August 21. Concerns of a potential malaria outbreak due to expanses of standing water led Haiti&#x27;s anti-malaria office to request the drug chloroquine from the US government. A total of 4.65 million chloroquine tablets were sent to Haiti in August and September 1980. Food-for-work programs organized by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and Catholic Relief Services (CRS) provided reliable food sources for many storm victims and provided additional tools and seeds. A total of $1 million was made available for 2,300 tons of fertilizer, additional farming tools, and funds for the internal transport of food and the fertilizer. Only $664,963 ended up being spent on this agriculture project. A total of $9,534,370 was spent by the US government, $277,853 by private US organizations, $3,649,172 by foreign governments, and $5,675,766 by foreign voluntary agencies (mostly other Red Crosses) on providing aid in the form of direct financial contributions, food, and supplies to Haiti.

In St. Lucia, Agriculture Minister Peter Josie announced that 90% of the island&#x27;s banana crop, 40% of its coconut crop, and 30% of its breadfruit trees were destroyed by Allen. In response, an emergency plan was implemented for the immediate replanting of vegetable and fruit crops due to the &quot;very bleak&quot; food situation. Josie also called for large investments of capital into rebuilding the severely disrupted shipping industry on the island, as 120 boats had been lost and 32 more damaged. US President Jimmy Carter declared six counties in southern Texas major disaster areas on August 11, allowing them to receive federal and state financing for cleanup from Allen. Seven American helicopters and 78 Americans assisted in the search for victims. Several stranded oil tankers had to be removed from the Gulf of Mexico, running the danger of a potential oil spill. The American Red Cross expected a $2 million expenditure for post-storm relief (as well as to shelter 136,000 evacuees during the storm&#x27;s climax). Most hotels in southern Texas reported minimal damage from the storm and planned to resume normal operations not long after the storm dissipated. After various tankers were grounded in silt stirred up by the hurricane, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requested the Coast Guard to compile a list of all ships still at sea near southern Texas.

=== Retirement ===
Because of the hurricane&#x27;s destructive impacts, the name &quot;Allen&quot; was retired from the Atlantic tropical storm name list by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1981, and will never again be used for a future Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced with &quot;Andrew&quot; for the 1986 season.

<text>Forrest Smith (February 14, 1886 – March 8, 1962) was an American politician who served as the 42nd governor of Missouri. He was a Democrat.

==Personal life==
Forrest Smith was born February 14, 1886, near Hardin in Ray County, Missouri. After receiving his secondary education at Woodson Institute in Richmond, Missouri, Smith attended Westminster College. On October 12, 1915, he married Mildred Williams and they were the parents of two daughters, Forrestine and Mary Josephine. Smith was a Methodist.

==Career==
Forrest Smith began his lifelong political career in 1910 when he became deputy assessor for Ray County, Missouri. In 1914 he was elected county clerk for Ray County, a post he held for the next eight years. From 1925 to 1932 Smith served on the Missouri state tax commission, a post that laid the groundwork for a long career in statewide elected office. In 1932 Forrest Smith was elected Missouri state auditor, a post he would hold for the next sixteen years until being elected governor in 1948. According to the August 16, 1948, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Smith &quot;helped himself get re-elected by reminding voters that he was the man who mailed out the old-age pension checks&quot;.

===Gubernatorial controversies===
From the outset, Forrest Smith&#x27;s term as governor was followed by whisper and innuendo, primarily that he owed his election to elements of organized crime. By 1948 reputed Kansas City mobster Charlie Binaggio had rebuilt a powerful political machine from the ashes of the one originally created by Boss Tom Pendergast, which he used in Smith&#x27;s favor. According to American Mafia.com:

The Smith-Binaggio connection and its effect on Mob business nationwide even played a part in Senator Estes Kefauver&#x27;s 1950 Senate Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in Interstate Commerce, in particular the Forrest Smith for Governor Club. This mafia influence greatly tainted the relationship between Smith and the national Democratic Party. Despite this, Smith, as sitting governor, was the lead delegate to the 1952 Democratic National Convention. Additionally, the 1950 murder of Binaggio had closed off many avenues of fundraising and guaranteed votes. By now in his mid-60s with a lifetime of public service, Governor Smith retired from public life following completion of his term in January 1953. Governor Smith died March 8, 1962, in Gulfport, Mississippi. He is buried in Sunny Slope Cemetery, Richmond, Missouri.

==Legacy==
:* The 1951 Municipal Land Clearance for Redevelopment Law. Signed by Smith, it allowed for the issuance of bonds by cities and towns statewide, which greatly expanded and improved public infrastructure such as water and sewer, as well as new industry in blighted areas.
:* Forrest Lake, the centerpiece of Thousand Hills State Park near Kirksville, Missouri, is named for Smith.
:* A dormitory at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri also bore his name before being torn down in 2004.
:* Missouri environmentalists consider an eloquent denunciation by former Governor Smith of US Army Corps of Engineers plans to construct a dam the Current River as being one of the contributing factor to the plans&#x27; defeat.

<doc id="967149" wikidata="Q1216943" url="?curid=967149" title="The Trojan Women">
<text>The Trojan Women (, lit. &quot;The Female Trojans&quot;) is a tragedy by the Greek playwright Euripides, produced in 415 BCE. Also translated as &quot;The Women of Troy,&quot; or as its transliterated Greek title &quot;Troades, The Trojan Women&quot; presents commentary on the costs of war through the lens of women and children. The four central women of the play are the same that appear in the final book of the &quot;Iliad,&quot; lamenting over the corpse of Hector after the Trojan War. 

&quot;Hecuba&quot;, another tragedy by Euripides, similarly deals with the experiences of women left behind by war and was more popular in antiquity.

The tragedy has inspired many modern adaptation across film, literature, and the stage. 

== Historical background ==
&quot;The Trojan Women&quot; was written as a reaction to the Siege of Melos in 416 BCE during the Peloponnesian War, in which Athens invaded the Aegean island of Melos, destroyed its city, and slaughtered and enslaved its populace &quot;(see History of Milos)&quot;.

It is the third play in a tetralogy by Euripides, all drawn from the same source material: the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The other works in the tetralogy include the tragedies &quot;Alexandros and Palamedes,&quot; and the comedic satyr play &quot;Sisyphus&quot;, all of which are largely lost, and only fragments survive. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Trojan Women&quot; was performed for the first time in 415 BCE as part of this tetralogy at the City Dionysia festival in Athens. Euripides won second place, losing to the obscure tragedian Xenocles.

==Plot==

Euripides&#x27;s play follows the fates of the women of Troy after their city has been sacked, their husbands killed, and their remaining families taken away as slaves. However, it begins first with the gods Athena and Poseidon discussing ways to punish the Greek armies because they condoned that Ajax the Lesser raped Cassandra, the eldest daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, after dragging her from a statue of Athena. What follows shows how much the Trojan women have suffered as their grief is compounded when the Greeks dole out additional deaths and divide their shares of women. The Greek herald Talthybius arrives to tell the dethroned queen Hecuba what will befall her and her children. Hecuba will be taken away to the Greek king Odysseus, and Cassandra is destined to become the conquering king Agamemnon&#x27;s concubine.

Cassandra, who can see the future, is morbidly delighted by this news: she sees that when they arrive in Argos, her new master&#x27;s embittered wife Clytemnestra will kill both her and her new master. She sings a wedding song for herself and Agamemnon that describes their bloody deaths. However, Cassandra is also cursed so that her visions of the future are never believed, and she is carried off.

The widowed princess Andromache arrives and Hecuba learns from her that her youngest daughter, Polyxena, has been killed as a sacrifice at the tomb of the Greek warrior Achilles.

Andromache&#x27;s lot is to be the concubine of Achilles&#x27; son Neoptolemus, and more horrible news for the royal family is yet to come: Talthybius reluctantly informs her that her baby son, Astyanax, has been condemned to die. The Greek leaders are afraid that the boy will grow up to avenge his father Hector, and rather than take this chance, they plan to throw him off from the battlements of Troy to his death.

Helen is supposed to suffer greatly as well: Menelaus arrives to take her back to Greece with him where a death sentence awaits her. Helen tries to convince Menelaus that Aphrodite was the cause of her betrayal and that she should not be punished, but Hecuba says that Helen is lying and has only ever been loyal to herself. While he remains resolved that he will slay her when they return to Greece, at the end of the play it is revealed that she is still alive; moreover, the audience knows from Telemachus&#x27; visit to Sparta in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; that Menelaus continued to live with Helen as his wife after the Trojan War.

In the end, Talthybius returns, carrying with him the body of little Astyanax on Hector&#x27;s shield. Andromache&#x27;s wish had been to bury her child herself, performing the proper rituals according to Trojan ways, but her ship had already departed. Talthybius gives the corpse to Hecuba, who prepares the body of her grandson for burial before they are finally taken off with Odysseus.

Throughout the play, many of the Trojan women lament the loss of the land that reared them. Hecuba in particular lets it be known that Troy had been her home for her entire life, only to see herself as an old grandmother watching the burning of Troy, the death of her husband, her children, and her grandchildren before she will be taken as a slave to Odysseus.

== Themes and significance ==
Hecuba: &quot;O my dear child, it is not the same to be alive and dead. The one is nothing but in the other there is hope.&quot; 

Andromache: &quot;Mother, listen to my argument, a powerful one, that I offer as a comfort to your heart. I say that never to have been is the same as death, but to die is better than to live in grief&quot;. &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; presents an anti-war narrative as it highlights the postwar experiences of the women left behind after the Trojan War. The women of Troy experience grief and suffering over the loss of their husbands and children. The tragedy also calls attention to how women were treated as commodities in antiquity by showing how they were divided among the remaining men as spoils of war. The character of Cassandra demonstrates how women were not listened to or taken seriously, but rather, seen as hysterical and irrational.

Euripides&#x27; social commentary on the costs of war &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; has left a lasting legacy. Many of its themes still resonate with the public today, inspiring modern adaptations. 

==Modern treatments and adaptations==
===Film===
The Mexican film &quot;Las Troyanas&quot; (1963) directed by Sergio Véjar, adapted by writer Miguel Angel Garibay and Véjar, is faithful to the Greek text and setting.

Cypriot-Greek director Michael Cacoyannis used Euripides&#x27; play (in the famous Edith Hamilton translation) as the basis for his 1971 film &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;. The movie starred American actress Katharine Hepburn as Hecuba, British actors Vanessa Redgrave and Brian Blessed as Andromache and Talthybius, French-Canadian actress Geneviève Bujold as Cassandra, Greek actress Irene Papas as Helen, and Northern Ireland-born Patrick Magee as Menelaus.

===Novel===
Sheri Tepper wove &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; into her 1988 feminist science fiction novel &quot;The Gate to Women&#x27;s Country&quot;.

===Stage===
A 1905 stage version, translated by Gilbert Murray, starred Gertrude Kingston as Helen and Ada Ferrar as Athena at the Royal Court Theatre in London.

The French public intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre wrote a version of &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (&quot;Les Troyennes&quot;) in 1965.

Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin (1943–1999) wrote his own version of the play, &quot;The Lost Women of Troy&quot;, adding more disturbing scenes and scatological details.

In 1974, Ellen Stewart, founder of La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in New York City, presented &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; as the last fragment of a trilogy (which included &quot;Medea&quot; and &quot;Electra&quot;). With staging by Romanian-born theatre director Andrei Serban and music by American composer Elizabeth Swados, this production went on to tour more than 30 countries over the course of 40 years. Since 2014, The Trojan Women Project has been sharing this production with diverse communities that now include Guatemala, Cambodia and Kosovo.

Charles L. Mee adapted &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; in 1994 to have a more modern, updated outlook on war. He included original interviews with Holocaust and Hiroshima survivors. His play is called &quot;Trojan Women: A Love Story&quot;.

In 2000, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival produced the play in modern costumes and props, with the Greek soldiers wearing camouflage and carrying assault rifles.

David Stuttard’s 2001 adaptation, &quot;Trojan Women&quot;, written in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, toured widely within the UK and was staged internationally. In an attempt to reposition &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; as the third play of a trilogy, Stuttard then reconstructed Euripides&#x27; lost &quot;Alexandros&quot; and &quot;Palamedes&quot; (in 2005 and 2006 respectively), to form a &quot;Trojan Trilogy&quot;, which was performed in readings at the British Museum and Tristan Bates Theatre (2007), and Europe House (2012) in London. He also wrote a version of the satyr play &quot;Sisyphus&quot; (2008) to round off Euripides&#x27; original trilogy.

Femi Osofisan&#x27;s 2004 play &quot;Women of Owu&quot; sets the story in 1821, after the conquest of the Owu kingdom by a coalition of other West African states. Although it is set in 19th century Africa, Osofisan has said that the play was also inspired by the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S.-led coalition.
Brad Mays directed a multimedia production for the ARK Theatre Company in Los Angeles in 2003. The play opened with a faux CNN TV news report intended to echo the then-current war in Iraq. A documentary film was made of the production, released in 2004.

&quot;The Women of Troy&quot;, directed by Katie Mitchell, was performed at the National Theatre in London in 2007/08. The cast included Kate Duchêne as Hecuba, Sinead Matthews as Cassandra and Anastasia Hille as Andromache.

&quot;The Trojan Women&quot;, directed by Marti Maraden, was performed at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival at the Tom Patterson Theatre in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, from 14 May to 5 October 2008 with Canadian actress Martha Henry as Hecuba.

Christine Evans reworked and modernised the &quot;Trojan Women&quot; story in her 2009 play &quot;Trojan Barbie&quot;. &quot;Trojan Barbie&quot; is a postmodern updating, which blends the modern and ancient worlds, as contemporary London doll repair shop owner Lotte is pulled into a Trojan women&#x27;s prison camp that is located in both ancient Troy and the modern Middle East.

In 2011, Anne Bogart&#x27;s SITI Company premiered &quot;Trojan Women (After Euripides)&quot; at Getty Villa before touring the production.

In 2016, Zoe Lafferty&#x27;s version of the play, &quot;Queens of Syria&quot;, in Arabic with English subtitles, was put on by the Young Vic before touring Britain.

In 2021, Anne Carson, the experimental poet, translator, and classicist, published her translation as &quot;Trojan Women: A Comic&quot; with illustrations by Rosanna Bruno, a portion of which was excerpted earlier that year in the 236th issue of the &quot;Paris Review&quot;. Carson&#x27;s vision was realised by Bruno to stage the production of a tragedy in the form of a &quot;comic,&quot; or graphic novel with the characters cast as uncanny figures, such as Hekabe as an old, once-regal dog, the goddess Athena as a pair of overalls wearing an owl mask, and the murdered baby Astyanax (last heir to the Trojan throne) as a poplar tree sapling.

In March 2023 a production of &quot;Women of Troy&quot; directed by Ben Winspear and starring his wife actor-producer Marta Dusseldorp was staged at the 10 Days on the Island festival in Tasmania, Australia. Poetry by Iranian-Kurdish refugee Behrouz Boochani, who was for many years detained by the Australian Government in Manus Island detention centre, was set to music composed by Katie Noonan and performed by a chorus of Tasmanian women and girls, interspersed with the text of the play.

<doc id="967152" wikidata="Q4904164" url="?curid=967152" title="Bidhu Jha">
<text>Bidhu Shekhar Jha (born August 4, 1942) is a Canadian politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 2003 to 2016, representing the Winnipeg division of Radisson as a member of the New Democratic Party.

==Early life and career==
Jha was born in Deoghar, Bihar, now a part of the Indian state of Jharkhand. He has a degree in mechanical engineering from BIT Sindri, and has taken postgraduate training in industrial engineering and management. He moved to Canada in 1969 and founded Optimum Ergonomics Ltd. in 1978, specializing in office and computer furnishings. He later founded the Optimum Technology Corporation, specializing in international trade and business development.

Jha authored the screenplay for a full-length feature film entitled &quot;Namumkin&quot; (1988), telling the story of an Asian family exiled from Idi Amin&#x27;s Uganda. He later served as president of Winnipeg&#x27;s Indian Association, and led a flag-raising ceremony in 1997 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of India&#x27;s independence. In 2001, he organized a dinner for British Columbia Premier Ujjal Dosanjh to mark his selection as Canada&#x27;s first provincial leader of South Asian background.

Jha served on the board of Manitoba Telephone System in 1986-87, and has also served on the boards of the Canadian Cancer Society and Deer Lodge Foundation. In 2002, he received a Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal and an Asia Pacific Award of Entrepreneurship from the Asper School of Business at the University of Manitoba. He was 63 years old as of 2006.

==Political career==
Jha ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1999 provincial election, and lost to Progressive Conservative candidate John Loewen in the south Winnipeg division of Fort Whyte. The New Democratic Party won a majority government across the province. After the election, Jha was appointed to the Board of the Manitoba Crown Corporations Council. He later chaired a Taxi-Cab Safety Working Group, which was convened after five Winnipeg drivers were murdered over the course of ten years. He issued a report calling for the installation of safety shields, cameras and recording devices; safety shields were made mandatory in 2002.

Jha was elected for the northeast Winnipeg division of Radisson in the 2003 general election, as the NDP won a second consecutive majority government across the province. On November 4, 2003, he was appointed Legislative Assistant to the Minister of Energy, Science and Technology. The following year, he was named as Legislative Assistant to the Premier. He played an active role in securing repairs for the Prendergast Community Centre, and accompanied Premier Gary Doer on a trade mission to India in 2006.

Jha broke ranks with his government in 2005 to oppose the construction of a large hog-processing facility in the Radisson division. Many of his constituents were against the project, and Jha argued that the facility should be built outside of the city. In response to criticism, Premier Doer announced in 2007 that the plant would not be constructed.

Some believed that Jha&#x27;s seat would be vulnerable in the 2007 provincial election, but he was re-elected by an increased margin.
Jha has won the seat for the third time in a row in 2011.

<text>Edman degradation, developed by Pehr Edman, is a method of sequencing amino acids in a peptide. In this method, the amino-terminal residue is labeled and cleaved from the peptide without disrupting the peptide bonds between other amino acid residues.

==Mechanism==
Phenyl isothiocyanate is reacted with an uncharged N-terminal amino group, under mildly alkaline conditions, to form a cyclical &quot;phenylthiocarbamoyl&quot; derivative. Then, under acidic conditions, this derivative of the terminal amino acid is cleaved as a thiazolinone derivative. The thiazolinone amino acid is then selectively extracted into an organic solvent and treated with acid to form the more stable phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)- amino acid derivative that can be identified by using chromatography or electrophoresis. This procedure can then be repeated again to identify the next amino acid. A major drawback to this technique is that the peptides being sequenced in this manner cannot have more than 50 to 60 residues (and in practice, under 30). The peptide length is limited due to the cyclical derivatization not always going to completion. The derivatization problem can be resolved by cleaving large peptides into smaller peptides before proceeding with the reaction. It is able to accurately sequence up to 30 amino acids with modern machines capable of over 99% efficiency per amino acid. An advantage of the Edman degradation is that it only uses 10 - 100 pico-moles of peptide for the sequencing process. The Edman degradation reaction was automated in 1967 by Edman and Beggs to speed up the process and 100 automated devices were in use worldwide by 1973.

==Limitations==
Because the Edman degradation proceeds from the N-terminus of the protein, it will not work if the N-terminus has been chemically modified (e.g. by acetylation or formation of pyroglutamic acid). Sequencing will stop if a non-α-amino acid is encountered (e.g. isoaspartic acid), since the favored five-membered ring intermediate is unable to be formed. Edman degradation is generally not useful to determine the positions of disulfide bridges. It also requires peptide amounts of 1 picomole or above for discernible results.

==Coupled analysis==
Following 2D SDS PAGE the proteins can be transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) blotting membrane for further analysis. Edman degradations can be performed directly from a PVDF membrane. N-terminal residue sequencing resulting in five to ten amino acid may be sufficient to identify a Protein of Interest (POI).

<text>Forrest Carl Donnell (August 20, 1884March 3, 1980) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States senator and the 40th governor of Missouri.

==Early life==
Donnell was born in Quitman, Missouri. Donnell graduated from Maryville High School in 1900, where his father was once mayor; the Donnells lived in the home that had once belonged to Albert Morehouse, who also served as governor.

At the University of Missouri he was a member of Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta Phi fraternities. He was also elected as a member of the Phi Beta Kappa, Theta Kappa Nu and QEBH societies. He was valedictorian of the 1904 class and received a law degree in 1907.

In 1907 he moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In October 1911 he and future Senator Selden P. Spencer founded the law firm Spencer &amp; Donnell. Donnell married Hilda Hays in 1913. They had two children, Ruth and John Lanier. In 1917 he was president of the Association of Young Republicans of Missouri; in 1918-1920, a member of the executive committee of the Republican State Committee of Missouri; and in 1919, a president of the 28th Ward Republican Club of St. Louis.

He was the city attorney for Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb southwest of St. Louis City.

==Governor==

Donnell was elected governor of Missouri in 1940 and served one term from 1941 to 1945.

He was the first Republican governor after the collapse of the Thomas Pendergast political machine and the only major Republican elected statewide in the 1940 election; Democrats delayed seating him for six weeks until being forced to do so by the Missouri Supreme Court in what was called the &quot;Great Governorship Steal&quot;.

Donnell had defeated St. Louis politician Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; McDaniel by 3,613 votes out of nearly 2 million cast, thanks largely to votes from rural areas.

Donnell&#x27;s predecessor Lloyd C. Stark had wrested control of federal appointments in the state from the Pendergast machine in 1936. Consequently, there was unease about a Republican taking over the appointments.

Within hours of the election, several members of the Democratic party met at the DeSoto Hotel in St. Louis to plan a response. Among those attending were Senator Bennett Champ Clark, St. Louis Mayor Bernard F. Dickmann, Democratic Party Chairman Robert Hannegan, Attorney General Roy McKittrick and state Democratic Chairman C. Marion Hulen.

Their strategy was to charge that Republican votes were fraudulently bought. They sought to use a provision of the Missouri Constitution that allowed the speaker of the house to &quot;count – tabulate – the votes and proclaim to the general public who won&quot;.

Donnell was refused to be seated while the speaker investigated the votes. Governor Stark urged that he be seated. The Missouri Supreme Court ultimately seated him.

Donnell was a Mason with Tuscan Lodge #360 in St. Louis, serving as Worshipful Master in 1915 and was elected Grand Master of Missouri A.F. &amp; A.M.(1942-1943) during his term as governor. Ironically, Democrat Harry S. Truman was to imply that Donnell helped Truman win the 1940 Senate election because of their Masonic 
bond.

Truman said:

:I had a Catholic friend in St. Louis by the name of James E. Wade. He attended a meeting [where] Davis made his usual charges. Forrest Donnell, who afterwards became [Republican] Governor and Senator, was speaking from the same platform. Donnell was just behind me in the Grand Lodge line and would be Grand Master in a year or two.

:So Jim Wade went up to him ... and asked him if I could be the low sort of fellow that Davis charged and still be Grand Master of Masons of Missouri. Mr. Donnell said: &#x27;No, Jim, he could not.&#x27; That ruined Mr. Davis—I won by 276,000 votes.&quot;

Donnell&#x27;s ambitious plans as governor were largely thwarted, despite the Republican party gaining control of the house of representatives and an equal share in the senate in 1942.

==Senator==
Donnell was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1944. In that race, he defeated state Attorney General Roy McKittrick by 1,988 votes out of nearly 1.56 million cast . McKittrick had unseated incumbent U.S. Senator Bennett Champ Clark in the Democratic primary. He served from 1945 to 1951. As senator, Donnell supported the Taft-Hartley Act, other antilabor measures, and lower income taxes. He opposed an excess-profits tax and most foreign aid. He lost to former U.S. Representative Thomas C. Hennings Jr. by 53.6%-to-46.4% in the United States Senate elections, 1950.

He returned to practicing law and retired in 1956. Donnell served as president of the University of Missouri Alumni Association and as a trustee of the State Historical Society of Missouri. He died in 1980 at the age of 95 in St. Louis. He is buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

<text>The 1960 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VIII Olympic Winter Games and also known as Squaw Valley 1960, were a winter multi-sport event held from February 18 to 28, 1960, at the Squaw Valley Resort (now known as Palisades Tahoe) in Squaw Valley (now known as Olympic Valley), California, United States. A total of 665 athletes representing 30 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, including South Africa who took part in the Winter Games for the first time. It was the first time all five continents represented in the Olympic rings (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) were represented in the Winter Games.

The games featured 27 events in 4 sports across 8 disciplines, including the Olympic debuts of biathlon and women&#x27;s speed skating. Due to a lack of entries, this was the first and only Winter Games which did not feature bobsledding as an event.

Athletes representing 14 NOCs received at least one medal, with 10 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. Athletes from the Soviet Union won the most gold medals, with seven, and the most overall medals, with 21. Soviet speed skaters Lidiya Skoblikova and Yevgeny Grishin tied for the most gold medals at the games with two each, while Finnish skier Veikko Hakulinen had the most total medals with three (one gold, one silver, and one bronze).

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s 1500 metres speed skating event due to a tie for first place.

<doc id="967170" wikidata="Q3569750" url="?curid=967170" title="Rabbinical Council of America">
<text>The Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) is one of the world&#x27;s largest organizations of Orthodox rabbis; it is affiliated with The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, more commonly known as the Orthodox Union (OU). It is the main professional rabbinical association within Modern Orthodox in the United States. Many rabbis of the RCA are graduates of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary of Yeshiva University or otherwise identify with Modern Orthodox Judaism.

==History==
The roots of the organization go back to 1923 when it was founded as the Rabbinical Council of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. Its purpose was to perpetuate and promote Orthodox Judaism in the United States of America.

Its members attempted on a number of occasions to merge with other Jewish groups, for the purpose of developing a unified traditional rabbinate for the American Jewish community. A number of attempts were made to join with groups, such as Agudat Israel, but all such attempts were rebuffed.

A merger took place in 1935 between the Rabbinical Council of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations and another Orthodox rabbinical group, the Rabbinical Association of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, a part of Yeshiva University. With this merger the combined group took the name Rabbinical Council of America (RCA). In 1942, the Hebrew Theological College alumni merged with the RCA. In later years, the RCA attempted to merge with another Orthodox rabbinical group, the Rabbinical Alliance of America, but this attempt failed. There was also a temporary adoption of the Orthodox Roundtable that was abandoned in 1991; RCA leadership tried to censor the group.

Most members of the Rabbinical Council of America are actively working as pulpit rabbis; a significant minority are working in Jewish education.

Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik played an important role in the RCA until his death in 1993.
For many years, the RCA was led by Rabbi Steven Dworkin, who served as executive vice-president until his death in January 2003. The RCA was then headed by Rabbi Basil Herring, who previously served as director of the Orthodox Forum. In September 2012 the RCA announced that Rabbi Herring was transitioning to the position of editor-in-chief of RCA Publications and that Rabbi Mark Dratch would take over as the new EVP.

In recent years, complaints have surfaced within the Orthodox Jewish community about a lack of leadership and direction by the RCA and that the RCA has failed to meet the challenges posed by recent changes within the Orthodox Jewish community.

It publishes an English quarterly journal, &quot;Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought&quot;, which began in 1958, and a Hebrew journal, &quot;HaDarom&quot;, which began in 1957.

The RCA was, for many years, affiliated with two yeshivas in Israel – Yeshivat HaDarom and the &quot;Gan Yavneh Youth Village.&quot; It severed its relations with both in 2009, pleading economic difficulties&quot;.&quot;

In 2009, it issued a protest against a USCCB statement on interfaith dialogue that was critical of dual-covenant theology.

As of 2010, there were close to 1,000 ordained rabbis in the RCA, spread throughout 14 countries.

==Geirus Policies and Standards committee==
In 2007, the RCA established a Geirus Policies and Standards (GPS) committee, to strive for uniform conversion procedures by its affiliated rabbis and local rabbinical courts across the United States.
The move was controversial, with some criticism that it would make conversion more difficult and intimidating, create onerous burdens for adopted children scheduled for conversion, and represented a capitulation to more conservative voices. Supporters of the GPS maintain that it would establish certainty for converts—particularly those looking to move to Israel and have their conversion recognized, create definite benchmarks, ensure observance of Jewish law by converts, and squelch past practices of questionable conversions that stemmed from situational pressure on individual rabbis.

Under the process created by the GPS, while individual rabbis mentor and educate potential converts, as was the case previously, a regional religious court (beth din) finalizes the conversion by examining the prospective convert and deciding whether to approving the application.

A week after the arrest of Rabbi Barry Freundel, a prominent Washington, D.C. area RCA member on charges of voyeurism at a &quot;mikvah&quot;, the RCA sought to contain damage from negative publicity. It announced on October 20, 2014 that it would now require the appointment of ombudswomen to protect the interests and handle concerns of women undergoing conversion to Judaism, a process which requires disrobing in a ritual bath. The council announced it would also create a commission to identify ways that abuses of converts during the conversion process could be prevented. The council noted that the commission will include female members. The crimes allegedly committed by Freundel sent shock waves through the American Jewish community and threatened to precipitate a crisis between the American and Israeli rabbinates. Initially, the spokesperson for the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, Ziv Maor, indicated that conversions Freundel had supervised would be reviewed, but after an emergency meeting the Rabbinate issued a statement that Freundel&#x27;s conversions before his arrest would be viewed as valid. In December 2014 the RCA was added as a defendant in a lawsuit prompted by Freundel&#x27;s alleged voyeurism. The lawsuit was filed by a student at Georgetown University&#x27;s law school who initially identified Kesher Israel Congregation, the synagogue where Freundel served as rabbi, the &quot;mikvah&quot;, and the law school as defendants for permitting Freundel’s alleged illegal activities to go unchecked. Two more lawsuits were filed by the end of 2014, alleging RCA was aware of irregular behavior on Freundel&#x27;s part but failed to remove him from positions of authority. Rabbi Marc D. Angel, a critic of the RCA&#x27;s new conversion system, claimed that if the allegations are true, they reinforce concerns about the concentration of conversion powers. &quot;This is a bad example of the fears we have had all along,&quot; Angel told &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;. &quot;If you concentrate too much power in few hands, then there is bound to be abuse, and this just confirms our deepest fears.&quot; In response to the lawsuits, RCA issued the following statement: &quot;The RCA has conducted itself appropriately and is taking important steps to improve its conversion protocols. We will defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.&quot;

On October 22, 2018, a $14.25 million class action settlement was reached over claims connected to Freundel. The RCA, along with Kesher Israel, the National Capital Mikvah, and the Beth Din of America, were named as settling defendants.

==Controversy==
Following the release of a resolution on gun usage and gun ownership in July 2014, a controversy arose where a group of 12 Orthodox rabbis—nine of them members of the RCA—issued a counterstatement disputing the resolution.
Subsequent dialogue focused on the alleged narrowness or breadth of the RCA statement in condemning &quot;gun violence&quot; and the &quot;critique of elements of American culture that valorize weaponry and violence” that focus exclusively on guns rather than non-firearm related violence in the United States,
while the RCA maintained that the resolution was &quot;not about particular laws and regulations but a critique of elements of American culture that valorize weaponry and violence. That is, it was a broader critique of American gun culture.&quot;
The original resolution was passed by a plurality in a vote that included less than ten percent of RCA members participating.

==Position on women&#x27;s ordination==
In 2015, the RCA passed a resolution which states, &quot;RCA members with positions in Orthodox institutions may not ordain women into the Orthodox rabbinate, regardless of the title used; or hire or ratify the hiring of a woman into a rabbinic position at an Orthodox institution; or allow a title implying rabbinic ordination to be used by a teacher of Limudei Kodesh in an Orthodox institution.&quot;

Rabbi Seth Farber, an RCA member, called the RCA’s resolution a “PR stunt by the right-wing membership of the RCA in order to further deepen the dividing lines among orthodoxy,” and said that he believed the RCA leadership did not support the resolution. Rabbi Avi Weiss and Rabbi Asher Lopatin resigned in protest of the RCA resolution.

<doc id="967174" wikidata="Q1169328" url="?curid=967174" title="The Guardian (1990 film)">
<text>The Guardian is a 1990 American supernatural horror film co-written and directed by William Friedkin, and starring Jenny Seagrove as a mysterious nanny who is hired by new parents, played by Dwier Brown and Carey Lowell, to care for their infant son; the couple soon discover the nanny to be a hamadryad, whose previous clients&#x27; children went missing under her care. The film is based on the novel &quot;The Nanny&quot;, by Dan Greenburg.

Director Sam Raimi was originally attached to the project, before dropping out to direct &quot;Darkman&quot;. Heavily marketed as director Friedkin&#x27;s first foray into the horror genre since 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, the film had a troubled production, with the script undergoing changes that continued well into the shooting process.

The film was released in the spring of 1990, and had a generally unfavorable critical reception, later making Roger Ebert&#x27;s &quot;most hated films&quot; list. A cable television version of the film was credited to &quot;Alan Von Smithee&quot;, due to Friedkin&#x27;s wish to disassociate himself from its release.

==Plot==
Molly and Allan Sheridan leave their two children in the care of a new nanny, Diana Julian. Diana, who is in fact an ancient Hamadryad, kidnaps their infant daughter, taking her to a forest where she approaches a giant, gnarled tree, serving the child as a human sacrifice to sustain the tree&#x27;s life. As she stares into a pool of water, Diana&#x27;s reflection transforms to that of a growling wolf.

Three months later, Phil and Kate Sterling have recently relocated from Chicago to Los Angeles, where Phil has taken a lucrative advertising job. Kate becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son, Jake. The couple decide to hire a nanny to allow each of them to maintain their jobs, and interview two candidates through a nanny agency: a young woman named Arlene, and a caring English woman, Camilla. When Arlene dies in a bicycling accident, Camilla is swiftly hired and becomes an invaluable member of the Sterlings&#x27; household.

One afternoon while Camilla rests in a meadow with Jake, she is approached by three aggressive bikers (Outlaw motorcycle club) who attempt to sexually assault her. She flees to the base of the gnarled tree, which subsequently comes to life, its branches strangling and eviscerating the men. Wolves consume the entrails of one of them, and another is impaled by the tree&#x27;s root and then bursts into flame. During a dinner party some days later, Ned, the Sterlings&#x27; neighbor who designed their home, invites Camilla on a date, which she declines. That night, Phil has a nightmare in which he has sex with Camilla. The next day, moments after Camilla leaves to go shopping, Ned stops by the house with a bouquet of flowers for her. Kate explains she just left on foot, and Ned drives after her, catching sight of her fleeing into the forest. Ned pursues her, eventually coming across her bathing in the creek. He watches as Camilla approaches the large tree, and begins to fuse with the tree bark. A pack of wolves pursue Ned, who flees back to his house. He leaves a rambling phone message for Phil and Kate. Moments later, Camilla appears, naked and ashen, on the hearth, telling Ned that he should not have followed her before the wolves break into the home, eating him alive. Camilla drags his remains away.

When checking the answering machine the following morning, Phil finds two messages: One from a stranger, Molly Sheridan, who says it is urgent she speak with him. The next is Ned&#x27;s, which is incoherent, but Camilla interrupts him from finishing listening to it. Phil meets with Molly the next day. She describes the disappearance of her infant daughter, as well as the nanny Diana, whom she came to discover to have been a false identity. She requests that Phil arrange for her to see Camilla, suspecting they are the same person. When Phil returns home, he listens to Ned&#x27;s message in full, which warns him against letting Camilla back in the house. Discovering Ned is missing, Phil confronts Camilla in front of Kate, but Jake grows violently ill during the confrontation and has to be rushed to the hospital, exhibiting coma-like symptoms.

Jake regains consciousness in the hospital, and Camilla attempts to kidnap him, but Phil intercepts, backhand slapped Camilla to the ground. Phil and Kate depart with Jake, and upon arriving home are confronted by a pack of wolves. Kate flees to the couple&#x27;s Jeep, while Phil runs toward the woods with Jake, as Camilla pursues them both, levitating through the forest, until they reach the large tree. Kate chases after them in the Jeep, eventually hitting and seemingly killing Camilla. As Phil examines Camilla&#x27;s body, he notices faces of babies embossed in the tree bark.

Later, a detective tells the couple no evidence of Camilla&#x27;s existence can be found. Phil decides to cut down the tree with a chainsaw, but in his absence, Kate is attacked by Camilla—now part-tree, part-human—who has again infiltrated the house. As Phil attempts to cut the tree, the branches entangle him and begin to bleed as he inflicts damage on them. The damage concurrently impacts Camilla, who is fighting Kate. When Phil saws off a large branch, Camilla&#x27;s leg severs from her body, allowing Kate to push her out a window. Simultaneously, Phil manages to fell the tree, but it combusts before landing, as Camilla&#x27;s body similarly disintegrates before hitting the ground. A bloodied Phil drops the chainsaw and returns home as Kate picks up Jake. Seeing the mess in the house, Phil realizes what happened as he is reunited with his wife and son, now knowing that with Camilla finally dead, his family is now safe.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Filming===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; was shot on location in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita, California. The forest location featured in the film was shot at a nature preserve in Valencia, California, near Six Flags Magic Mountain.

===Script changes===
The original script for &quot;The Guardian&quot; bore a closer resemblance to its source material, &quot;The Nanny&quot; by novelist Dan Greenburg, which told the story of a nanny who steals children. According to screenwriter Stephen Volk, Sam Raimi was originally attached to the picture. Raimi had dropped out of the production to direct &quot;Darkman&quot;, at which point William Friedkin was brought in to direct. The script, which had originally been conceived as a tongue-in-cheek thriller for Raimi, eventually &quot;metamorphosed into something different&quot; during the course of filming, as Friedkin made numerous changes. Volk attempted to rework the script for Friedkin, initially re-writing the character of the nanny as a real-life Lilith, the child-stealing demon from Jewish mythology. Friedkin dismissed the idea, and Volk then reworked the script into a straightforward psychological thriller about an unhinged woman stealing children; however, Universal Pictures objected to the reworking, stating that they wanted a &quot;supernatural&quot; horror film given Friedkin&#x27;s reputation for &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). Amidst the shifting script, Friedkin began auditioning for the role of Camilla. Uma Thurman was originally a candidate for the role prior to the script changes. After Volk suggested using elements from the M.R. James story &quot;The Ash-tree&quot; in the script, Friedkin became fixated on incorporating a tree into Camilla&#x27;s backstory. Volk reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown and left the production, leaving Friedkin to finish the script&#x27;s loose ends after filming had already begun.

In a 2015 interview, Jenny Seagrove recalled visiting Friedkin at his home in Los Angeles, where he told her he had been reading about Druid mythology and wanted to incorporate it into the film. According to Seagrove: &quot;Pages were flying at us [...] and then suddenly this idea of this weird kind of tree came about, and suddenly my character was not just a nanny but she was a Druid character who turned into a part of the tree, and she had to feed the tree—things were evolving all the time.&quot;

===Special effects===
Seagrove underwent numerous extensive makeup transformations in the film, at times covered in tree bark during the metamorphosing scenes. The tree featured in the film was constructed by the special effects department in Burbank, California, and transported to the nature preserve in Valencia. The tree contained tubes of circulating fake blood in order for the tree to properly &quot;bleed&quot; when cut.

==Alternate endings==
The television version of the film ends with Phil and Kate returning home from the hospital with Jake, while Camilla is alive and naked at the tree. Director William Friedkin disapproved of the television cut of the film, and removed his name from the credits, naming &quot;Alan von Smithee&quot; as the director.

The video and DVD versions have the full ending, in which Camilla appears in her true form and tries to take the baby from Kate, but Phil cuts down the tree with a chainsaw, thus killing both it and Camilla.

==Release==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; was released in North American cinemas on April 27, 1990, opening at #3 at the box office, on 1,684 screens, with a USD$5,565,620 weekend. The film went on to gross a total of $17,037,887 domestically.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; earned mostly negative reviews from critics, and holds a 25% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes from 12 reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four, and later named it as one of his &quot;Most Hated Films&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a middling review, saying &quot;[Friedkin] never sustains the story&#x27;s tension for very long, and even cuts off the scarier episodes before they have a chance to sink in. What&#x27;s more, he never offers a consistent idea of what sort of evil is at work here.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; also gave the film a negative review, stating: &quot;the plot is so preposterous that &quot;The Guardian&quot; never comes close to grabbing attention, empathy or sympathy.&quot; David Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Like &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; is a horror story set in the bosom of the nuclear family, and it, too, tries to exploit a culturewide fear, turning a shared guilt into monstrous projection. The guilt of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, however, is far more mundane and far less gripping than &quot;The Exorcist&quot;″s agony over our abandonment of the church.&quot; Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;pretty good claptrap,&quot; but noted that &quot;as it makes its way to a bloody payoff, it loses immediacy and individuality, subsiding into bloody cliche.&quot;

&quot;Time Out&quot; said in their review of the film: &quot;Friedkin opts for up-front hokum, interspersed with impressively ridiculous special effects, including man-eating trees, flying nannies and coniferous chainsaw carnage. A severely flawed but not unamusing venture from a director who should know better.&quot;

Director William Friedkin himself acknowledged the critical response. In a 1990 interview with The New York Times, he noted: &quot;I think the story has potential, but it got lost in translation. The idea of a mother protecting her child against a demonic force, that&#x27;s something that could have been much more poignant.&quot; To the question &quot;Which films were the farthest?&quot; on his career, William Friedkin cited &quot;The Guardian&quot; and simply said about it: &quot;&quot;The Guardian&quot; I don’t think works.&quot;

Actress Jenny Seagrove said of the film in retrospect, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to put off anyone from watching it because it is good fun,&quot; but noted that, during the first screening, &quot;there was a feeling in the room that it wasn&#x27;t the sort of picture everyone had hoped it was going to be.&quot; She also said: &quot;It has become a cult film, but the screenplay was appalling. It was being written on the hoof.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Guardian&quot; was released on VHS by MCA Universal home video in October 1990. It was later licensed by Universal for a DVD release through Anchor Bay Entertainment, released it on October 12, 1999. The DVD features an audio commentary by director Friedkin, as well as the original theatrical trailer. This release has been long out of print and is difficult to obtain, although a UK DVD by Second Sight, also featuring Friedkin&#x27;s commentary, has subsequently become widely available.

The film was released on Blu-ray for the first time by Shout Factory on January 19, 2016. A UK Blu-ray by Final Cut Entertainment is due for release in October 2018.

<text>The Eye of Horus, also known as left &quot;wedjat&quot; eye or &quot;udjat&quot; eye, specular to the Eye of Ra (right &quot;wedjat&quot; eye), is a concept and symbol in ancient Egyptian religion that represents well-being, healing, and protection. It derives from the mythical conflict between the god Horus with his rival Set, in which Set tore out or destroyed one or both of Horus&#x27;s eyes and the eye was subsequently healed or returned to Horus with the assistance of another deity, such as Thoth. Horus subsequently offered the eye to his deceased father Osiris, and its revitalizing power sustained Osiris in the afterlife. The Eye of Horus was thus equated with funerary offerings, as well as with all the offerings given to deities in temple ritual. It could also represent other concepts, such as the moon, whose waxing and waning was likened to the injury and restoration of the eye.

The Eye of Horus symbol, a stylized eye with distinctive markings, was believed to have protective magical power and appeared frequently in ancient Egyptian art. It was one of the most common motifs for amulets, remaining in use from the Old Kingdom () to the Roman period (30 BC – 641 AD). Pairs of Horus eyes were painted on coffins during the First Intermediate Period () and Middle Kingdom (). Other contexts where the symbol appeared include on carved stone stelae and on the bows of boats. To some extent the symbol was adopted by the people of regions neighboring Egypt, such as Syria, Canaan, and especially Nubia.

The eye symbol was also rendered as a hieroglyph (). Egyptologists have long believed that hieroglyphs representing pieces of the symbol stand for fractions in ancient Egyptian mathematics, although this hypothesis has been challenged.

==Origins==

The ancient Egyptian god Horus was a sky deity, and many Egyptian texts say that Horus&#x27;s right eye was the sun and his left eye the moon. The solar eye and lunar eye were sometimes equated with the red and white crown of Egypt, respectively. Some texts treat the Eye of Horus seemingly interchangeably with the Eye of Ra, which in other contexts is an extension of the power of the sun god Ra and is often personified as a goddess. The Egyptologist Richard H. Wilkinson believes the two eyes of Horus gradually became distinguished as the lunar Eye of Horus and the solar Eye of Ra. Other Egyptologists, however, argue that no text clearly equates the eyes of Horus with the sun and moon until the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1070 BC); Rolf Krauss argues that the Eye of Horus originally represented Venus as the morning star and evening star and only later became equated with the moon.

Katja Goebs argues that the myths surrounding the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Ra are based around the same mytheme, or core element of a myth, and that &quot;rather than postulating a single, original myth of one cosmic body, which was then merged with others, it might be more fruitful to think in terms of a (flexible) myth based on the structural relationship of an Object that is missing, or located far from its owner&quot;. In the myths surrounding the Eye of Ra, the goddess flees Ra and is brought back by another deity. In the case of the Eye of Horus, the eye is usually missing because of Horus&#x27;s conflict with his arch-rival, the god Set, in their struggle for the kingship of Egypt after the death of Horus&#x27;s father Osiris.

==Mythology==
The Pyramid Texts, which date to the late Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BC), are one of the earliest sources for Egyptian myth. They prominently feature the conflict between Horus and Set, and the Eye of Horus is mentioned in about a quarter of the utterances that make up the Pyramid Texts. In these texts, Set is said to have stolen the Eye of Horus, and sometimes to have trampled and eaten it. Horus nevertheless takes back the eye, usually by force. The texts often mention the theft of Horus&#x27;s eye along with the loss of Set&#x27;s testicles, an injury that is also healed. The conflict over the eye is mentioned and elaborated in many texts from later times. In most of these texts, the eye is restored by another deity, most commonly Thoth, who was said to have made peace between Horus and Set. In some versions, Thoth is said to have reassembled the eye after Set tore it to pieces. In the Book of the Dead from the New Kingdom, Set is said to have taken the form of a black boar when striking Horus&#x27;s eye. In &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Set&quot;, a text from the late New Kingdom that relates the conflict as a short narrative, Set tears out both of Horus&#x27;s eyes and buries them, and the next morning they grow into lotuses. Here it is the goddess Hathor who restores Horus&#x27;s eyes, by anointing them with the milk of a gazelle. In Papyrus Jumilhac, a mythological text from early in the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC), Horus&#x27;s mother Isis waters the buried pair of eyes, causing them to grow into the first grape vines.

The restoration of the eye was often referred to as &quot;filling&quot; the eye. Hathor filled Horus&#x27;s eye sockets with the gazelle&#x27;s milk, while texts from temples of the Greco-Roman era said that Thoth, together with a group of fourteen other deities, filled the eye with specific plants and minerals. The process of filling the Eye of Horus was likened to the waxing of the moon, and the fifteen deities in the Greco-Roman texts represented the fifteen days from the new moon to the full moon.

The Egyptologist Herman te Velde suggests that the Eye of Horus is linked with another episode in the conflict between the two gods, in which Set subjects Horus to a sexual assault and, in retaliation, Isis and Horus cause Set to ingest Horus&#x27;s semen. This episode is narrated most clearly in &quot;The Contendings of Horus and Set&quot;, in which Horus&#x27;s semen appears on Set&#x27;s forehead as a golden disk, which Thoth places on his own head. Other references in Egyptian texts imply that in some versions of the myth it was Thoth himself who came forth from Set&#x27;s head after Set was impregnated by Horus&#x27;s semen, and a passage in the Pyramid Texts says the Eye of Horus came from Set&#x27;s forehead. Te Velde argues that the disk that emerges from Set&#x27;s head is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus&#x27;s eye when it appears on Set&#x27;s head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the eye and step in to make peace between the feuding deities.

Beginning in the New Kingdom, the Eye of Horus was known as the &quot;wḏꜣt&quot; (often rendered as &quot;wedjat&quot; or &quot;udjat&quot;), meaning the &quot;whole&quot;, &quot;completed&quot;, or &quot;uninjured&quot; eye. It is unclear whether the term &quot;wḏꜣt&quot; refers to the eye that was destroyed and restored, or to the one that Set left unharmed. 
Upon becoming king after Set&#x27;s defeat, Horus gives offerings to his deceased father, thus reviving and sustaining him in the afterlife. This act was the mythic prototype for the offerings to the dead that were a major part of ancient Egyptian funerary customs. It also influenced the conception of offering rites that were performed on behalf of deities in temples. Among the offerings Horus gives is his own eye, which Osiris consumes. The eye, as part of Osiris&#x27;s son, is ultimately derived from Osiris himself. Therefore, the eye in this context represents the Egyptian conception of offerings. The gods were responsible for the existence of all the goods that they were offered, so offerings were part of the gods&#x27; own substance. In receiving offerings, deities were replenished by their own life force, as Osiris was when he consumed the Eye of Horus. In the Egyptian worldview, life was a force that originated with the gods and circulated through the world, so that by returning this force to the gods, offering rites maintained the flow of life. The offering of the eye to Osiris is another instance of the mytheme in which a deity in need receives an eye and is restored to well-being. The eye&#x27;s restorative power meant the Egyptians considered it a symbol of protection against evil, in addition to its other meanings.

==In ritual==
===Offerings and festivals===
In the Osiris myth, the offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris was the prototype of all funerary offerings, and indeed of all offering rites, as the human giving an offering to a deity was likened to Horus and the deity receiving it was likened to Osiris. Moreover, the Egyptian word for &quot;eye&quot;, &quot;jrt&quot;, resembled &quot;jrj&quot;, the word for &quot;act&quot;, and through wordplay the Eye of Horus could thus be equated with any ritual act. For these reasons, the Eye of Horus symbolized all the sustenance given to the gods in the temple cult. The versions of the myth in which flowers or grapevines grow from the buried eyes reinforce the eye&#x27;s relationship with ritual offerings, as the perfumes, food, and drink that were derived from these plants were commonly used in offering rites. The eye was often equated with &quot;maat&quot;, the Egyptian concept of cosmic order, which was dependent on the continuation of the temple cult and could likewise be equated with offerings of any kind.

The Egyptians observed several festivals in the course of each month that were based on the phases of the moon, such as the Blacked-out Moon Festival (the first of the month), the Monthly Festival (the second day), and the Half-Month Festival. During these festivals, living people gave offerings to the deceased. The festivals were frequently mentioned in funerary texts. Beginning in the time of the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC), funerary texts parallel the progression of these festivals, and hence the waxing of the moon, with the healing of the Eye of Horus.

===Healing texts===
Ancient Egyptian medicine involved both practical treatments and rituals that invoked divine powers, and Egyptian medical papyri do not clearly distinguish the two. Healing rituals frequently equate patients with Horus, so the patient may be healed as Horus was in myth. For this reason, the Eye of Horus is frequently mentioned in such spells. The Hearst papyrus, for instance, equates the physician performing the ritual to &quot;Thoth, the physician of the Eye of Horus&quot; and equates the instrument with which the physician measures the medicine with &quot;the measure with which Horus measured his eye&quot;. The Eye of Horus was particularly invoked as protection against eye disease. One text, Papyrus Leiden I 348, equates each part of a person&#x27;s body with a deity in order to protect it. The left eye is equated with the Eye of Horus.

==Symbol==

Horus was represented as a falcon, such as a lanner or peregrine falcon, or as a human with a falcon head. The Eye of Horus is a stylized human or falcon eye. The symbol often includes an eyebrow, a dark line extending behind the rear corner of the eye, a cheek marking below the center or forward corner of the eye, and a line extending below and toward the rear of the eye that ends in a curl or spiral. The cheek marking resembles that found on many falcons. The Egyptologist Richard H. Wilkinson suggests that the curling line is derived from the facial markings of the cheetah, which the Egyptians associated with the sky because the spots in its coat were likened to stars.

The stylized eye symbol was used interchangeably to represent the Eye of Ra. Egyptologists often simply refer to this symbol as the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye.

===Amulets===

Amulets in the shape of the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye first appeared in the late Old Kingdom and continued to be produced up to Roman times. Ancient Egyptians were usually buried with amulets, and the Eye of Horus was one of the most consistently popular forms of amulet. It is one of the few types commonly found on Old Kingdom mummies, and it remained in widespread use over the next two thousand years, even as the number and variety of funerary amulets greatly increased. Up until the New Kingdom, funerary &quot;wedjat&quot; amulets tended to be placed on the chest, whereas during and after the New Kingdom they were commonly placed over the incision through which the body&#x27;s internal organs had been removed during the mummification process.

&quot;Wedjat&quot; amulets were made from a wide variety of materials, including Egyptian faience, glass, gold, and semiprecious stones such as lapis lazuli. Their form also varied greatly. These amulets could represent right or left eyes, and the eye could be formed of openwork, incorporated into a plaque, or reduced to little more than an outline of the eye shape, with minimal decoration to indicate the position of the pupil and brow. In the New Kingdom, elaborate forms appeared: a uraeus, or rearing cobra, could appear at the front of the eye; the rear spiral could become a bird&#x27;s tail feathers; and the cheek mark could be a bird&#x27;s leg or a human arm. Cobras and felines often represented the Eye of Ra, so Eye of Horus amulets that incorporate uraei or feline body parts may represent the relationship between the two eyes, as may amulets that bear the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye on one side and the figure of a goddess on the other. The Third Intermediate Period (c. 1070–664 BC) saw still more complex designs, in which multiple small figures of animals or deities were inserted in the gaps between the parts of the eye, or in which the eyes were grouped into sets of four.

The eye symbol could also be incorporated into larger pieces of jewelry alongside other protective symbols, such as the &quot;ankh&quot; and &quot;djed&quot; signs and various emblems of deities. Beginning in the thirteenth century BC, glass beads bearing eye-like spots were strung on necklaces together with &quot;wedjat&quot; amulets, which may be the origin of the modern nazar, a type of bead meant to ward off the evil eye.

Sometimes temporary amulets were created for protective purposes in especially dangerous situations, such as illness or childbirth. Rubrics for ritual spells often instruct the practitioner to draw the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye on linen or papyrus to serve as a temporary amulet.

===Other uses===
&quot;Wedjat&quot; eyes appeared in a wide variety of contexts in Egyptian art. Coffins of the First Intermediate Period () and Middle Kingdom often included a pair of &quot;wedjat&quot; eyes painted on the left side. Mummies at this time were often turned to face left, suggesting that the eyes were meant to allow the deceased to see outside the coffin, but the eyes were probably also meant to ward off danger. Similarly, eyes of Horus were often painted on the bows of boats, which may have been meant to both protect the vessel and allow it to see the way ahead. &quot;Wedjat&quot; eyes were sometimes portrayed with wings, hovering protectively over kings or deities. Stelae, or carved stone slabs, were often inscribed with &quot;wedjat&quot; eyes. In some periods of Egyptian history, only deities or kings could be portrayed directly beneath the winged sun symbol that often appeared in the lunettes of stelae, and Eyes of Horus were placed above figures of common people. The symbol could also be incorporated into tattoos, as demonstrated by the mummy of a woman from the late New Kingdom that was decorated with elaborate tattoos, including several &quot;wedjat&quot; eyes.

Some cultures neighboring Egypt adopted the &quot;wedjat&quot; symbol for use in their own art. Some Egyptian artistic motifs became widespread in art from Canaan and Syria during the Middle Bronze Age. Art of this era sometimes incorporated the &quot;wedjat&quot;, though it was much more rare than other Egyptian symbols such as the &quot;ankh&quot;. In contrast, the &quot;wedjat&quot; appeared frequently in art of the Kingdom of Kush in Nubia, in the first millennium BC and early first millennium AD, demonstrating Egypt&#x27;s heavy influence upon Kush. Down to the present day, eyes are painted on the bows of ships in many Mediterranean countries, a custom that may descend from the use of the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye on boats.

===Hieroglyphic form===

A hieroglyphic version of the &quot;wedjat&quot; symbol, labeled D10 in the list of hieroglyphic signs drawn up by the Egyptologist Alan Gardiner, was used in writing as a determinative or ideogram for the Eye of Horus.

The Egyptians sometimes used signs that represented pieces of the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye hieroglyph. In 1911, the Egyptologist Georg Möller noted that on New Kingdom &quot;votive cubits&quot;, inscribed stone objects with a length of one cubit, these hieroglyphs were inscribed together with similarly shaped symbols in the hieratic writing system, a cursive writing system whose signs derived from hieroglyphs. The hieratic signs stood for fractions of a &quot;hekat&quot;, the basic Egyptian measure of volume. Möller hypothesized that the Horus-eye hieroglyphs were the original hieroglyphic forms of the hieratic fraction signs, and that the inner corner of the eye stood for 1/2, the pupil for 1/4, the eyebrow for 1/8, the outer corner for 1/16, the curling line for 1/32, and the cheek mark for 1/64. In 1923, T. Eric Peet pointed out that the hieroglyphs representing pieces of the eye are not found before the New Kingdom, and he suggested that the hieratic fraction signs had a separate origin but were reinterpreted during the New Kingdom to have a connection with the Eye of Horus. In the same decade, Möller&#x27;s hypothesis was included in standard reference works on the Egyptian language, such as &quot;Ägyptische Grammatik&quot; by Adolf Erman and &quot;Egyptian Grammar&quot; by Alan Gardiner. Gardiner&#x27;s treatment of the subject suggested that the parts of the eye were used to represent fractions because in myth the eye was torn apart by Set and later made whole. Egyptologists accepted Gardiner&#x27;s interpretation for decades afterward.

Jim Ritter, a historian of science and mathematics, analyzed the shape of the hieratic signs through Egyptian history in 2002. He concluded that &quot;the further back we go the further the hieratic signs diverge from their supposed Horus-eye counterparts&quot;, thus undermining Möller&#x27;s hypothesis. He also reexamined the votive cubits and argued that they do not clearly equate the Eye of Horus signs with the hieratic fractions, so even Peet&#x27;s weaker form of the hypothesis was unlikely to be correct. Nevertheless, the 2014 edition of James P. Allen&#x27;s &quot;Middle Egyptian&quot;, an introductory book on the Egyptian language, still lists the pieces of the &quot;wedjat&quot; eye as representing fractions of a &quot;hekat&quot;.

The hieroglyph for the Eye of Horus is listed in the Egyptian Hieroglyphs block of the Unicode standard for encoding symbols in computing, as U+13080 (). The hieroglyphs for parts of the eye (, , , , , , ) are listed as U+13081 through U+13087.

<doc id="967182" wikidata="Q5149710" url="?curid=967182" title="Columbia Heights (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Columbia Heights is a neighborhood in Washington, D.C., located in Northwest D.C. Bounded by 16th Street NW, W Street NW, Florida Avenue NW, Barry Place NW, Sherman Avenue NW, Spring Road NW, and New Hampshire Avenue 
NW. neighborhood is an important retail hub for the area, as home to DC USA mall and to numerous other restaurants and stores, primarily along the highly commercialized 14th Street. Columbia Heights is home to numerous historical landmarks, including Meridian Hill Park, National Baptist Memorial Church, All Souls Church, along with a number of embassy buildings.

Developed as a suburb after the U.S. Civil War, the area&#x27;s growth accelerated in the early 1900s. The extension of the DC streetcar system in 1914 made the neighborhood a popular place to live among federal workers. In the 1940s, the designation of Cardozo High School as a &quot;colored&quot; school resulted in a demographic shift and the neighborhood became predominantly African-American. The 1968 Washington, D.C., riots devastated the area and turmoil in the 1970-80s followed. Beginning in the late 1990s, the addition of the Columbia Heights metro station led to the redevelopment of the neighborhood. Today the neighborhood has diverse demographics.

==History==
===19th century===

Once farmland on the estate of the Holmead family (called &quot;Pleasant Plains&quot;), Columbia Heights was part of Washington County, in the District of Columbia; it was within the District but outside the borders of the city of Washington. In 1815, William J. Stone purchased a 121-acre tract of the Holmead estate—east of present-day Georgia Avenue, and north of modern Florida Ave—and established his estate known as the Stone Farm. Nearby, construction of the first building for Columbian College, now George Washington University, was completed in 1822 on the campus which was bounded by Columbia Road, 14th Street, Boundary Street (Florida Avenue) and 13th Street. The area began developing as a suburb of Washington soon after the American Civil War, when horse-drawn streetcars delivered residents of the neighborhood to downtown.

The northern portion of modern-day Columbia Heights (i.e., north of where Harvard Street currently lies) was, until the 1880s, a part of the village of Mount Pleasant. The southern portion still retained the name of the original Pleasant Plains estate, though it was also known as &quot;Cowtown.&quot;

In 1871, Congress passed the D.C. Organic Act, which eliminated Washington County by extending the boundaries of Washington City to be contiguous with those of the District of Columbia. Shortly afterward, in 1881–82, Senator John Sherman, author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, purchased the land north of Boundary Street between 16th Street and 10th Street, including the Stone farm, developing it as a subdivision of the city and calling it Columbia Heights in honor of the college at its heart. (The neighborhood&#x27;s eastern, major traffic artery, Sherman Avenue, is named after its early developer.) Much of Sherman&#x27;s purchase was land belonging to Columbian College.

The college moved to the center of Washington&#x27;s downtown business district and in 1904, changed its name to The George Washington University, in an agreement with the George Washington Memorial Association. By 1912 Columbian, now George Washington, relocated its major operations to Foggy Bottom. The federal government purchased some of the college&#x27;s former land and built Meridian Hill Park in the early 20th century.

===20th century===

Upscale development in Columbia Heights circa 1900 was designed to attract upper level managers of the Federal government, U.S. Supreme Court justices, and high-ranking military officers. An imposing mansion known as &quot;Belmont&quot; marked the entrance to the neighborhood between Florida and Clifton Streets. The mansion was emblematic of the confidence that the affluent placed in the concept that Columbia Heights represented the ideal suburb. In the early 1900s, many of Washington&#x27;s wealthiest residents lived in the neighborhood. Residents included authors Jean Toomer, Ambrose Bierce, Sinclair Lewis, Chief Justice Melville Fuller, and Justice John Marshall Harlan.

In 1901, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia renamed streets all over the District in accordance with a newly adopted street-naming system. In Columbia Heights, Clifton Street, Roanoke Street, Yale Street, Princeton Street, Harvard Street, Columbia Road, Kenesaw Avenue, Kenyon Street, Dartmouth Street, and Whitney Avenue were renamed Adams Street, Bryant Street, Channing Street, Douglas Street, Evarts Street, Franklin Street, Girard Street, Hamlin Street, Hooker Street, and Irving Street, respectively.

In 1902, there was a building boom in North Columbia Heights, with the expansion of the streetcar down 11th St, 14th St and 16th St. Homes were being built for between $2,000 and $5,000 and a total of five million dollars&#x27; worth of homes were being built.

In 1904, the Columbia Heights Citizen&#x27;s Association published an illustrated brochure entitled &quot;A Statement of Some of the Advantages of Beautiful Columbia Heights.&quot; 1904 was also the year that Congress authorized changing the names of streets to align with the alphabetical and orderly naming convention of the Old City (i.e., below Boundary Street, now Florida Avenue).

By 1914, four street car lines served the section providing transportation to downtown Washington in twenty minutes. The neighborhood also became the home of the Washington Palace Five professional basketball team.

The popularity of the neighborhood resulted in the construction of several large apartment buildings during the beginning of the twentieth century that changed the suburban character of the area into a more urban and densely populated district. As of mid-century, however, Columbia Heights retained much of its upscale residential appeal, supporting establishments such as the ornate Tivoli Theatre movie house (completed in 1924).

J. Willard Marriott and his wife opened an A&amp;W Root Beer franchise on 14th street in 1927, before creating the Marriott hotel chain. The neighborhood was adjacent to Washington&#x27;s thriving middle-class black community and came to be home to some of its most notable citizens by the 1930s.

In 1949, during the era of racial segregation in the public schools, Central High School, a white high school that bordered the southern edge of Columbia Heights, did not have enough students. It was renamed as Cardozo High School and designated as a &quot;colored&quot; high school to accommodate the growing African-American population in the neighborhood. Significant demographic changes began in the late 1940s when African-American residents began to buy apartment buildings previously owned by whites, and in the 1950s blacks bought individual homes in ever increasing numbers. The neighborhood was a strong middle-class African-American enclave in Washington, along with the nearby Shaw neighborhood and Howard University, through the mid-1960s.

The neighborhood was featured in various clips, and as the home of protagonists Helen and Bobby Benson, in the 1951 film &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;.

In 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots ravaged the 14th St. Corridor in Columbia Heights, along with the commercial U Street corridor nearby, and many other Washington neighborhoods to the east. Many middle-class residents moved out to the suburbs, resulting in a drop in business. As a result, many homes and shops remained vacant for decades. In addition to African Americans, the neighborhood had an increasing number of Latino immigrants and their descendants as residents.

===21st century===

In 1999, the city announced a revitalization initiative for the neighborhood focused around the Columbia Heights Metro station, which opened in September of that year. The opening of the Metro station served as a catalyst for the return of economic development and residents. 

Nearby, Giant Food supermarket opened, and Tivoli Square, a commercial and entertainment complex, dating from the 1920s was renovated.

There had already been positive developments along lower 14th Street and the U Street corridor.

On March 5, 2008, DC USA, a shopping mall across the street from the Columbia Heights Metro station opened. It includes many stores and restaurants as well as 1,000 spaces of underground parking. 

As of 2018, approximately 22% of the housing stock in the neighborhood was reserved for low income renters.

==Geography==
In the Northwest quadrant of Washington, D.C., Columbia Heights borders the neighborhoods of U Street Corridor (Cardozo/Shaw), Adams Morgan, Meridian Hill, Mount Pleasant, Park View, Pleasant Plains, and Petworth. On the eastern side is Howard University. The streets defining the neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries are 16th Street to the west, Spring Road to the north; Sherman Ave to the east, and Florida Avenue to the south. It is served by the Columbia Heights station on the Green line of the Washington Metro.

==Demographics==

The 2010 census figures estimated Columbia Heights had a 43.5% African-American population, including government and other professional class; 28.1% Hispanic population; 22.9% White population; 3.2% Asian population; and a 2% Other population.

The 2000 census figures estimated Columbia Heights had a 58% African-American population, including some African immigrants of the 20th century and later, and government and professional class; 34% Hispanic population; 5.4% white population; and 3.1% other.

In 2012, Columbia Heights was named one of the fastest gentrifying neighborhoods in the United States.

==Landmarks==

The Columbia Heights Farmers Market, across the street from DC USA, provides neighborhood shoppers with locally produced food.

In January 2005, the GALA Hispanic Theatre moved into the newly refurbished Tivoli Theatre as its first permanent home. This former movie theater, built in 1924, had been vacant since 1976. GALA is a theater company dedicated since the 1970s to performing Spanish-language plays.

In November 2006, the Dance Institute of Washington, a minority-led professional ballet and dance center, opened a facility across the street from the Tivoli Theatre.

The neighborhood is also home to several organizations that serve minorities such as the Greater Washington Urban League, the local affiliate of the National Urban League, The Latin American Youth Center, CentroNia, Mexican Cultural Institute, and the Central American Resource Center (CARECEN).

The Embassy of Ecuador, Washington, D.C. is on 15th Street.

Notable historic structures in the neighborhood include the David White House, Mary Ann Shadd Cary House, Embassy Building No. 10, Meridian Manor, Olympia Apartments, Clifton Terrace, Hilltop Manor (The Cavalier Apartment Building), Trinity Towers, the Riggs–Tompkins Building, Park Road Courts, and Truck Company F.

The Banneker Community Center, a unit of the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation, contains playing fields, Basketball courts, tennis courts, a swimming pool (Banneker pool), a computer lab and other indoor and outdoor facilities. The center&#x27;s main building was constructed in 1934 near Howard University and named for Benjamin Banneker. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 because of its important role in the development of the black community in Washington, D.C.

Columbia Heights Green is a garden in a former wrecking yard. In 2010, Washington Parks and People purchased the land for $1. Community work days are every Saturday. The garden has community beds.

The Columbia Heights Day Festival is a one-day street festival is a celebration of the diversity and community of Columbia Heights.

<text>Claytonia perfoliata, commonly known as miner&#x27;s lettuce, rooreh, Indian lettuce, or winter purslane, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae. It is an edible, fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America.

==Description==
&quot;Claytonia perfoliata&quot; is a tender rosette-forming plant that grows to some in height, but mature plants can be as short as . The cotyledons are usually bright green (rarely purplish- or brownish-green), succulent, long and narrow. The first true leaves form a rosette at the base of the plant, and are long, with a typically long petiole (exceptionally up to long).

The small pink or white flowers have five petals long. The flowers appear from February to May or June and are grouped 5–40 together. The flowers grow above a pair of leaves that are connected together around the stem so as to appear as a single circular leaf. Mature plants form a rosette; they have numerous erect to spreading stems that branch from the base.

&quot;C. perfoliata&quot; is common in the springtime, and prefers a cool, damp environment. The plant first appears in sunlit areas after the first heavy rains of the year, though the best stands are found in shaded areas, especially in the uplands, into early summer. As the days get hotter and drier, the leaves turn a deep red color as they dry out.

==Taxonomy==
Together with two other &quot;Claytonia&quot; species, &quot;Claytonia parviflora&quot; and &quot;C. rubra&quot;, &quot;C. perfoliata&quot; comprises what is almost certainly a polyploid pillar complex, which is based on three diploid species. Two key studies on the population ecology and genetics of the &quot;C. perfoliata&quot; complex were published in 2012.

=== Subspecies ===
There are three well-studied geographical subspecies of &quot;C. perfoliata&quot;:
* &quot;Claytonia perfoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;perfoliata&quot;: Pacific coastal United States and Canada (British Columbia)
* &quot;Claytonia perfoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;intermontana&quot;: interior western United States
* &quot;Claytonia perfoliata&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicana&quot;: coastal southern California and Arizona, all the way south to Mexico to Guatemala

===Other names===
&quot;C. perfoliata&quot; is called &#x27;piyada̠&#x27; in the Western Mono language and &#x27;palsingat&#x27; in Ivilyuat — two Native American languages of California or &#x27;rooreh&#x27; in (Ohlone language)

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to Mexico and western north America as far north as British Columbia. 

It has been introduced into and is widely naturalized in western Europe, Argentina and New Zealand It was introduced to Europe in the 18th century, possibly by the naturalist Archibald Menzies, who brought it to Kew Gardens in London in 1794. It was first recorded in the wild in Britain in South Hampshire in 1849 and is still spreading. As of 2019 sightings of this plant have been found as far inland as Arkansas.

==Uses==
The common name of &quot;miner&#x27;s lettuce&quot; refers to how the plant was used by miners during the California Gold Rush, who ate it to prevent scurvy. It is in season in April and May, and can be eaten as a leaf vegetable. The entire plant is edible, except the roots, and it provides vitamin C. Most commonly, it is eaten raw in salads, but it is not quite as delicate as cultivated lettuce. Sometimes, it is boiled like spinach, which it resembles in taste and chemical composition. Caution should be used because wild &quot;C. perfoliata&quot; can sometimes accumulate toxic amounts of sodium oxalate (as can happen in spinach).

The plant is known as &quot;palsingat&quot; or, possibly, &quot;lahchumeek&quot; in Ivilyuat and it was eaten fresh or boiled as a green by the Ivilyuqaletem (Cahuilla) people of Southern California. It, along with &quot;Claytonia exigua&quot;, is available for gathering in the early spring.

==Etymology==
The genus &quot;Claytonia&quot; is named in honor of the American botanist John Clayton. The specific epithet &quot;perfoliata&quot; means perfoliate, referring to the stem appearing to go through the leaf.
