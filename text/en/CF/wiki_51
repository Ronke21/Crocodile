<text>Hits Radio East Midlands is an Independent Regional Radio station based in Nottingham, England, owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK as part of the Hits Radio network. It broadcasts to the East Midlands.

As of September 2024, the station has a weekly audience of 157,000 listeners according to RAJAR.

==History==
===Radio 106===
Radio 106 launched at 6am on Tuesday 23 September 1997 as the East Midlands’ Independent Regional Radio station. Billed as &quot;Radio for Grown Ups&quot;, with an advertising campaign on Central TV for the launch, and an episode of Central TV&#x27;s &#x27;24 hours&#x27; in 1998 documented the launch and the relaunch of the station, the station was launched by ex-Radio Trent managing director Ron Coles with former Centre Radio MD Ken Warburton as programming controller. The first presenter on air was Dickie Dodd.

Radio 106&#x27;s launch schedule included a heavy emphasis on speech content, including daily guests on mid-morning shows and a nightly 3-hour phone-in. Specialist music output featured country, soul and motown at weekends. The station&#x27;s launch team included Kevin Fernihough, Mark Keen, Willie Morgan, Kenny Hague, Jake Yapp, Peter King and Sarah Graham.

Against competition from established BBC Local Radio and GWR-owned commercial stations, Radio 106 recorded poor listening figures, so within seven months of launch, the station&#x27;s owners Border Radio Holdings opted for a complete relaunch.

===Century 106===
In April 1998, John Myers took control of the station, which was rebranded as &quot;Century 106&quot; and relaunched with a new team of presenters, including Adrian Allen and Chris Ashley. Former Radio Trent presenter David Lloyd became the station&#x27;s Managing Director and Programme Controller with ex-Trent colleagues including Tony Lyman, Craig Strong, Gary Burton and Andy Marriott joining the presenting line-up. Other additions to the team included Steve Jordan (breakfast) and Bernie Keith (afternoons).

In May 2000, Century 106, along with the other Century stations in the North East and North West, were sold to Capital Radio. David Lloyd left the station to join Galaxy 105 in Leeds while presenter Adrian Allen walked out mid-show in protest. The sale to Capital brought an increase in the station&#x27;s sports coverage - as emphasised in the slogan &quot;music, fun and football&quot;. More new presenters joined Century, including Ian Skye, Jason King, Stuart Ellis, Sam Pinkham and Paula White.

===Heart 106 ===
When Capital later merged with GWR, the Office of Fair Trading ordered Century to be sold off. Chrysalis bought Century 106 for £29.5m and planned to rebrand the station as Heart 106, to go with 100.7 Heart FM in the West Midlands as the area matched that of the ITV Central region and would make it more attractive to advertisers.

Heart 106 was launched on 29 August 2005. A further, more subtle rebrand was applied in September 2006 which saw the dropping of the frequencies from station names across the Heart Network.

On 25 June 2007, Chrysalis announced the sale of Heart, along with its sister stations The Arrow, LBC and Galaxy, for £170 million to Global Radio.

Following Global&#x27;s takeover of GCap Media, the Office of Fair Trading again ordered Global to sell off Heart and four other Midlands stations - BRMB, Mercia FM, Wyvern FM and Beacon Radio. In May 2009, the stations were sold to Orion Media, a company backed by Lloyds Development Capital and Phil Riley.

===Gem 106===
On 9 November 2010, Orion Media announced that Heart 106 would be relaunched and renamed as &#x27;Gem 106&#x27; on 1 January 2011. Under the rebrand, the station ended its franchise agreement with Global Radio which allowed it to use the Heart identity and carry networked programming from London.

Gem 106 was launched at midnight on Saturday 1 January 2011 with a special programme presented by Orion&#x27;s director of programming and marketing David Lloyd. The GEM name stands for &#x27;Great East Midlands&#x27;, the name created and used from 1988 onwards for GEM-AM (later Classic Gold GEM) an AM (medium wave), &#x27;solid gold&#x27; secondary service of Radio Trent. The majority of the station&#x27;s programming is locally produced and broadcast from Nottingham.

As of March 2016, Gem refreshed their imaging and jingle package using a custom package from Wisebuddah, at which point the &#x27;106&#x27; was dropped from the name.

On 6 May 2016, the station&#x27;s owners, Orion, announced they had been bought by Bauer for an undisclosed fee, reportedly between £40 and £50 million. As of August 2016, Gem is aligned with the Hits Radio network, using its generic on-air imaging package. The station retained its own regional programming throughout the day.

In July 2019, Gem began taking overnight programming from the Hits Radio Network in Manchester on Sunday - Thursday nights before gradually expanding to evening and off-peak output. 

As of May 2022, Gem broadcasts a regional breakfast show on weekdays from the Nottingham studios, alongside hourly news bulletins seven days a week and traffic updates at peak times. All other programming output comes from the Hits Radio Network.

===End of analogue broadcasting - 106 MHz FM===

On 29 August 2023, Bauer announced that from 2 October 2023, Gem will be available only on DAB and online, while its FM frequency, 106 MHz will be switched to Greatest Hits Radio, stating that &#x27;there are so many FM frequencies in the area it was not possible for both stations to be on FM at once&#x27;.

At 10:00pm on 1 October 2023, Gem ceased FM transmissions. The station&#x27;s FM frequency, 106 MHz FM, was switched to Greatest Hits Radio East Midlands.

===Hits Radio rebrand===
On 10 January 2024, station owners Bauer announced Gem would be rebranded as Hits Radio East Midlands from 17 April 2024, as part of a network-wide relaunch involving 17 local radio stations in England and Wales.

The station&#x27;s regional programming was not affected as a result of the rebranding.

==Audience==
According to RAJAR figures up to June 2016, the station was listened to by 503,000 people (out of a possible 2,384,000 listeners) per week, with each listener tuning in for an average of 7.1 hours over the course of 7 days.

==Programming==
All networked programming originates from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester studios.

Regional programming is produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Nottingham studios from 6-10am on weekdays.

===News===
Bauer&#x27;s Birmingham and Nottingham newsrooms broadcast regional news bulletins on the hour from 6am-7pm on weekdays, from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half hour during weekday breakfast with updates every 20 minutes during weekday drivetime.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried hourly at all other times, apart from Sunday afternoons.

<doc id="956130" wikidata="Q5593834" url="?curid=956130" title="Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was an honor presented to male recording artists at the 45th Grammy Awards in 2003 and the 46th Grammy Awards in 2004 for quality rap solo performances. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958, and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Starting in 1991, the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category. In 2003, the category was divided by gender with the introduction of the Female to accompany the award for Male Rap Solo Performances. The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance. American singers Nelly and Eminem received the awards for Best Male Rap Solo Performance.

==Background==
In 1991, the Academy began to honor individual rap performances with the Best Rap Solo Performance category. The category name remained unchanged until 2004 when it was split into separate categories for Female and Male Rap Solo Performances. The categories remained separated by gender for one additional year. In 2005, they were merged into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance. Female rapper MC Lyte has campaigned for the reinstatement of the female-specific category and believes that &quot;it destroys [hip-hop] culture to not have the perspective of a woman&quot;. Bill Freimuth, Recording Academy Vice President of Awards, claimed that the category was eliminated because &quot;[there] wasn&#x27;t enough competition essentially, due to the lack of the number of releases in that category.&quot; Black Entertainment Television (BET) executive Stephen Hill cited a similar reason for the elimination of the female categories by the BET Hip Hop Awards and VH1&#x27;s Hip Hop Honors, reflecting a lack of female representation in the hip hop music scene for several years. As of 2011, the category name has not changed since 2005.

==Recipients==


For the 45th Grammy Awards (2003), Best Male Rap Solo Performance nominees included: Eminem for &quot;Without Me&quot;, Jay-Z for &quot;Song Cry&quot;, Ludacris for &quot;Rollout (My Business)&quot;, Mystikal for &quot;Bouncin&#x27; Back (Bumpin&#x27; Me Against the Wall)&quot;, and Nelly for &quot;Hot in Herre&quot;. Additionally Eminem was nominated for: Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video for &quot;Without Me&quot; as well as Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for &quot;The Eminem Show&quot;. Ludacris&#x27; &quot;Word of Mouf&quot; and Mystikal&#x27;s &quot;Tarantula&quot; were also nominated for Best Rap Album. Nelly also earned nominations for Album of the Year and Best Rap Album for the album &quot;Nellyville&quot; as well as Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for the song &quot;Dilemma&quot; (featuring Kelly Rowland), for a total five. Regarding his nominations, Nelly commented: &quot;It&#x27;s always good to be nominated, especially for something as big as the Grammys. Just the recognition itself is an award. But you want that little gold record player. You just want to take it home.&quot; The award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance was presented to Nelly at Madison Square Garden in New York City, though not broadcast on television. His performances of &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; and &quot;Dilemma&quot; alongside Rowland at the awards ceremony included pyrotechnics. In addition, Nelly received the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.

Nominees for the 46th Grammy Awards included: 50 Cent for &quot;In da Club&quot;, Joe Budden for &quot;Pump It Up&quot;, Eminem for &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, Ludacris for &quot;Stand Up&quot;, and Sean Paul for &quot;Get Busy&quot;. 50 Cent&#x27;s other nominations included Best New Artist and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (with Lil&#x27; Kim), Best Rap Album for &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, and Best Rap Song for &quot;In da Club&quot;, for a total of five. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; also earned Eminem nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Rap Song, and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Ludacris was also nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Gossip Folks&quot; (with Missy Elliott), while Paul was nominated for Best New Artist and received the award for Best Reggae Album for &quot;Dutty Rock&quot;. The award was presented to Eminem, who also received the award for Best Rap Song. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; also earned Eminem an Academy Award for Best Original Song, marking the first rap song to receive the honor. In 2004, the American Film Institute included the song at No. 93 on their list of &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Music in the Movies&quot; list and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song No. 166 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

Prior to the separate female and male categories, Eminem received the award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2000 for &quot;My Name Is&quot; and in 2001 for &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;. Nelly earned nominations in 2001 for &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot; and in 2002 for &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;. Following the return to the genderless category, Eminem earned nominations in 2005 for &quot;Just Lose It&quot;, in 2006 for &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, and in 2010 for &quot;Beautiful&quot;. Eminem was presented the award for Best Rap Solo Performance in 2011 for &quot;Not Afraid&quot;.

<text>Robert Hayden (August 4, 1913February 25, 1980) was an American poet, essayist, and educator. He served as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress from 1976 to 1978, a role today known as US Poet Laureate. He was the first African-American writer to hold the office.

==Biography==
Robert Hayden was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Ruth and Asa Sheffey, who separated before his birth. He was taken in by a foster family next door, Sue Ellen Westerfield and William Hayden, and grew up in the Detroit neighborhood called &quot;Paradise Valley&quot;. The Haydens&#x27; perpetually contentious marriage, coupled with Ruth Sheffey&#x27;s competition for her son&#x27;s affections, made for a traumatic childhood. Witnessing fights and suffering beatings, Hayden lived in a house fraught with &quot;chronic anger&quot;, the effects of which would stay with him throughout his life. On top of that, his severe visual problems prevented him from participating in activities such as sports in which nearly everyone else was involved. His childhood traumas resulted in debilitating bouts of depression that he later called &quot;my dark nights of the soul&quot;.

Because he was nearsighted and slight of stature, he was often ostracized by his peers. In response, Hayden read voraciously, developing both an ear and an eye for transformative qualities in literature. He attended Detroit City College (later called Wayne State University) with a major in Spanish and minor in English and left in 1936 during the Great Depression, one credit short of finishing his degree, to go to work for the Works Progress Administration Federal Writers&#x27; Project, where he researched black history and folk culture.

Leaving the Federal Writers&#x27; Project in 1938, Hayden married Erma Morris in 1940 and published his first volume, &quot;Heart-Shape in the Dust&quot; (1940). He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1941 and won a Hopwood Award there. Raised as a Baptist, he followed his wife into the Bahá&#x27;í Faith during the early 1940s, and raised a daughter, Maia, in the religion. Hayden became one of the best-known Bahá&#x27;í poets. Erma Hayden was a pianist and composer and served as supervisor of music for Nashville public schools.

In pursuit of a master&#x27;s degree, Hayden studied under W. H. Auden, who directed his attention to issues of poetic form, technique, and artistic discipline. Auden&#x27;s influence may be seen in the &quot;technical pith of Hayden&#x27;s verse&quot;. After finishing his degree in 1942, then teaching several years at the University of Michigan, Hayden went to Fisk University in 1946, where he remained for 23 years, returning to the University of Michigan in 1969 to complete his teaching career (1969-80). Concurrent with his teaching responsibilities at Fisk, he served as poet-in-residence at Indiana State University in 1967 and visiting poet at the University of Washington in 1969, the University of Connecticut in 1971, Dennison University in 1972, and Connecticut College in 1974.

As a supporter of his religion&#x27;s teaching of the unity of humanity, Hayden could never embrace Black separatism. Thus, the title poem of &quot;Words in the Mourning Time&quot; ends in a stirring plea in the name of all humanity: 
He died in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on February 25, 1980, aged 66.

In 2012 the U.S. Postal Service issued a pane of stamps featuring ten great Twentieth Century American Poets, including Hayden.

==Career==
By the 1960s and the rise of the Black Arts Movement, when a more youthful era of Afro-American artists composed politically and emotionally charged protest poetry overwhelmingly coordinated to a black audience, Hayden&#x27;s philosophy about the function of poetry and the way he characterized himself as an author were settled. His refusal to revamp himself as indicated by the pictures of the 1960s earned him feedback from a few scholars and analysts. Hayden stayed consistent with his idea of poetry as an artistic frame instead of a polemical demonstration and to his conviction that poetry ought to, in addition to other things, address the qualities shared by mankind, including social injustice. Hayden&#x27;s beliefs about the relationship of the artist to his poems likewise had an impact in his refusal to compose emotionally determined protest sonnets. Hayden&#x27;s practice was to make separation between the speaker and the movement of the poem.

His work often addressed the plight of African Americans, usually using his former home of Paradise Valley slum as a backdrop, as he does in the poem &quot;Heart-Shape in the Dust&quot;. He made ready use of black vernacular and folk speech, and he wrote political poetry as well, including a sequence on the Vietnam War.

On the first poem of the sequence, he said: &quot;I was trying to convey the idea that the horrors of the war became a kind of presence, and they were with you in the most personal and intimate activity, having your meals and so on. Everything was touched by the horror and the brutality and criminality of war. I feel that&#x27;s one of the best of the poems.&quot;

The impact of Euro-American innovation on Hayden&#x27;s poetry and also his continuous assertions that he needed to be viewed as an &quot;American poet&quot; as opposed to a &quot;black poet&quot; prompted much feedback of him as an abstract &quot;Uncle Tom&quot; by Afro-American critics during the 1960s. However, Afro-American history, contemporary black figures, for example, Malcolm X, and Afro-American communities, especially Hayden&#x27;s native Paradise Valley, were the subjects of a significant number of his poems.

On April 7, 1966, Hayden&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of Remembrance&quot; was awarded, by unanimous vote, the Grand Prize for Poetry at the first World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal. The festival had more than ten thousand people from thirty-seven nations in attendance. However, on April 22, 1966, Hayden was denounced at a Fisk University conference of black writers by a group of young protest poets led by Melvin Tolson for refusing to identify himself as a black poet.

=== Nature poetry ===
Hayden is also known as a nature poet and is included in the anthology &quot;Black Nature: Four Centuries of African American Nature Poetry.&quot; His poem &quot;A Plague of Starlings&quot; is one of the more famous of his nature-based poems. The poem &quot;Night-Blooming Cereus&quot; is another example of Hayden&#x27;s depiction of the natural world. The poem presents a series of haiku-like stanzas. Hayden said that he was inspired by a trip to Duluth, Minnesota during the smelt fishing season. He describes how the poem &quot;[...]turned into a haiku, where you get it all by suggestion and implication&quot;.

=== Poetic influences ===
Robert Hayden has often been praised for his work crafting poems, the unique perspectives in his work, his exact language, and his absolute command of traditional poetic techniques and structures. Hayden&#x27;s influences included Elinor Wylie, Countee Cullen, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Arna Bontemps, John Keats, W. H. Auden and W. B. Yeats.

As he became a well-known poet, he influenced society in a way that enforced the many ideas that were created during the 1900s. Some of his influential poems are, &quot;Angle of Ascent&quot;, &quot;Elegies for Paradise Valley&quot;, &quot;Night, Death, Mississippi&quot;, and &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Although Hayden was a very well-known poet in the present day, he was not as well-known back during his time as a poet. His poems were not highly regarded due to the vast discrimination and prejudice that was during the 1900s. However, in the modern day, his work is highly sought after as his poems big contributions to society.

Hayden was elected to the American Academy of Poets in 1975. His most famous poem is &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot;, which deals with the memory of fatherly love and loneliness. It ranks among the most anthologized American poems of the twentieth century. He declined the position later called United States Poet Laureate previously, accepted the appointment for 19761977 during America&#x27;s Bicentennial, and again in 1977–1978 though his health was failing then. He was awarded successive honorary degrees by Brown University (1976) and Fisk, (1978). In 1977 he was interviewed for television in Los Angeles on &quot;At One With&quot; by Keith Berwick. In January 1980 Hayden was among those gathered to be honored by President Jimmy Carter and his wife at a White House reception celebrating American poetry. He served for a decade as an editor of the Bahá&#x27;í journal &quot;World Order&quot;.

Other famed poems include &quot;The Whipping&quot; (about a small boy being severely punished for some undetermined offense), &quot;Middle Passage&quot; (inspired by the events surrounding the &quot;United States v. The Amistad&quot; affair), &quot;Runagate, Runagate&quot;, and &quot;Frederick Douglass&quot;.

<doc id="956135" wikidata="Q176041" url="?curid=956135" title="Elisabeth of Valois">
<text>Elisabeth of France, or Elisabeth of Valois (; ) (2 April 1546 – 3 October 1568), was Queen of Spain as the third wife of Philip II of Spain. She was the eldest daughter of Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

==Early life==

Elisabeth was born in the Château de Fontainebleau. She was raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Jean d&#x27;Humières and Françoise d&#x27;Humières. During childhood, she was called &quot;Ysabel&quot;. 

Elisabeth&#x27;s childhood was spent in the French royal nursery, where her father insisted she share her bedroom with her future sister-in-law, Mary, Queen of Scots, who was about three years older. Although Elisabeth had to give precedence to Mary (since Mary was already a crowned queen), the two would remain close friends for the rest of their lives. 

Her lady-in-waiting, Claude de Vineulx, accompanied her to Spain and often wrote reports of Elisabeth&#x27;s health to Catherine. She was described as being shy, timid and very much in awe of her formidable mother, even as there is evidence in letters that Catherine was tender and loving towards her. While it is acknowledged that her sister Margaret and her future sister-in-law Mary were both prettier than she, Elisabeth was nevertheless still considered one of Catherine&#x27;s attractive daughters. 

In 1550, Elisabeth&#x27;s father, Henry, began negotiations for her marriage to Edward VI of England. This arrangement brought condemnation from Pope Julius III who reportedly stated that he would excommunicate both if they married. Henry, undeterred, agreed to a dowry of 200,000 écus in July 1551, which became irrelevant upon Edward&#x27;s death in 1553.

==Queen of Spain==
Elisabeth married Philip II of Spain on the 22nd of June 1559. Originally married via proxy at Notre Dame (with the Duke of Alba standing in for Philip) prior to leaving France, the actual ceremony took place in Guadalajara, Spain, upon her arrival. The marriage was a result of the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis (1559). His second wife, Mary I of England, had recently died, making Elisabeth of Valois Philip&#x27;s third wife. Elisabeth&#x27;s paternal aunt Margaret was also betrothed as part of the peace treaty with the duke of Savoy. 

A few days after this proxy marriage, on the 30 June 1559, a tournament was held by Henry II near Place des Vosges to celebrate the peace and his daughter Elisabeth&#x27;s wedding. Tragedy would follow as, during a jousting match, King Henry was wounded in the eye by a fragment of the splintered lance of count of Montgomery, captain of the King&#x27;s Scottish Guard. Despite the efforts of royal surgeons this led to Henry&#x27;s death by sepsis on 10 July 1559. Elisabeth&#x27;s 15-year-old brother then became the new King of France and on 10 July 1559 he was crowned. 

Because of her father&#x27;s death and her brother&#x27;s coronation as well as a becoming sick with &quot;stomach flu&quot;, her departure for her new country was severely delayed. In November the court, as well as Elisabeth&#x27;s sister-in-law Mary, had gathered to bid the young princess goodbye. Elisabeth&#x27;s mother Catherine was unable to attend as the King had requested that she not leave his side. At the palace of Châtellerault When the retinue could finally begin their journey in November the speed at which they could travel was hampered by the many possessions Elisabeth was bringing, consisting of baskets and trunks filled to the brim with plates, linen, carpets, and jewelry. Added to this was a multitude of furniture and paintings as well as a retinue of 160 people. Elisabeth&#x27;s gowns were so ornate that they couldn&#x27;t be packed in trunks and therefore were sent by ship to Spain.

As a consequence of the large travelling party, the weather, and the resulting difficulty of the journey across the Pyrenees, Elisabeth did not arrive in Spain until February 1560.

Elisabeth left France dressed as a &quot;daughter of France&quot; and arrived in Spain with her 16 French ladies &quot;transformed&quot; in the Spanish style. At her wedding she met both the painter Sofonisba Anguissola and Ana de Mendoza, who would live with her the rest of her life. Philip II appointed Anguissola to be a lady-in-waiting and court painter for his queen. Under Anguissola&#x27;s tutelage, Elisabeth improved her amateur painting skills. Anguissola also influenced the artistic works of her children, Isabella Clara Eugenia and Caterina Michaela, during her time at the court.

Elisabeth brought a large entourage with her from France, including two chief ladies-in-waiting (Claude de Vineulx and Jeanne de Chassincourt), eight ladies-in-waiting (among them Louise de Clermont), four chamberwomen, kitchen staff, the surgeon Dunoir, the physician Burgensis and two apothecaries. Later the young queen&#x27;s household would contain a majority of Spanish nobility ladies-in-waiting and also some Italian ladies. Elisabeth&#x27;s childhood companions and relatives Anne and Suzanne de Bourbon also accompanied her.

One of her new favorites was Marta Tana, the future mother of Saint Aloysius.

Philip was completely enchanted by his 14-year-old bride and by 1564 had given up his infidelities. Despite the significant age difference, Elisabeth was also quite pleased with her husband. (In letters to her mother, she proclaimed herself to be fortunate to have married so charming a prince.) Philip enjoyed hosting chivalric tournaments to entertain his wife. Elisabeth would play liege lady to the three young princes of the Spanish Court: Carlos, Prince of Asturias; John of Austria (illegitimate son of Charles V); and Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma (son of Charles V&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Margaret). If Philip was pleased with his new wife, Elisabeth&#x27;s slow adaption of the rigid Spanish court etiquette or what was expected of a Spanish queen consort was noted and her behavior such as her disorganized manner of eating (a reference to a perceived excessive consumption of meat and snacking). Both taking to her bed at the first sign of illness and her lack of interest in political matters were critiziced. 

Even more shocking for the Spanish court, Elisabeth allowed dancing in her private chambers. This led to Elisabeth&#x27;s sister-in-law Joanna of Austria to openly complain about Elisabeth&#x27;s conduct to the Portuguese ambassador. Life at the Spanish court was more confining than the French court as demonstrated by the young queen&#x27;s majordomo, the count of Alba every night locking her inside her chambers and handing the key to Elisabeth&#x27;s chief lady-in-waiting, the countess of Urena.

Elisabeth had originally been betrothed to Philip&#x27;s son, Carlos, Prince of Asturias, but political complications unexpectedly necessitated instead a marriage to Philip. Her relationship with her troubled stepson Carlos was warm and friendly. Despite reports of his progressively bizarre behavior, Carlos was always kind and gentle to Elisabeth. When Philip eventually felt it necessary to lock Carlos away (which shortly led to the Prince&#x27;s demise), Elisabeth cried for days.

Philip was very attached to Elisabeth, staying close by her side even when she was ill with smallpox. Elisabeth&#x27;s first pregnancy in 1560 resulted in a stillborn son, followed in 1564 with a miscarriage of twin girls. She later gave birth to Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia on 12 August 1566, and then to Isabella&#x27;s younger sister Catalina Micaela on 10 October 1567. Phillip and Elisabeth were very close to both of their daughters, buying them jams, dolls, toys and more. It is said &quot;both rejoiced at the birth of Isabella as if it had been the birth of a son&quot;. Elisabeth contributed the birth of her first daughter to a miracle attributed to Saint Eugene of Toledo, whose relics she had brought with her as a dowry to Spain.

Elisabeth corresponded with her former sister-in-law, Mary Stuart, who suggested that her infant son James be smuggled out of Scotland and brought to Spain. James would then be raised at the Spanish court and marry one of Elisabeth&#x27;s daughters. But it was not meant to be: by the time Mary&#x27;s letter reached Spain, Elisabeth suffered another miscarriage on 3 October 1568 and died the same day at Royal Palace of Aranjuez along with her newborn infant daughter.

After the death of Elisabeth, Catherine de&#x27; Medici offered her younger daughter Margaret as a bride for Philip. Philip declined the offer.

==In fiction==

Elisabeth of Valois is a central character in Thomas Otway&#x27;s play &quot;Don Carlos, Prince of Spain&quot;; in Schiller&#x27;s play of the same name; in Verdi&#x27;s opera adapted from Schiller&#x27;s play, also titled &quot;Don Carlos&quot;; and in several other, less well-known operas. Antonio Buzzolla&#x27;s version of 1850 is actually named &quot;Elisabetta di Valois&quot;. All these works imply a tragic romance between Elisabeth and Carlos, suggesting that they were really in love with each other when Elisabeth was forced to break off her engagement to Carlos and marry his father Philip.

In Madame de Lafayette&#x27;s novella &quot;The Princesse de Cleves&quot;, Elisabeth of Valois&#x27; marriage to Philip II is the occasion for the wedding games at which her father Henri II dies; her role is brief but it substantially affects the novella&#x27;s narrative arc.

Elisabeth of Valois is portrayed by Caoimhe O&#x27;Malley (in the pilot) on the CW show &quot;Reign&quot;, then later by Anastasia Phillips in the fourth season of the show.

Elisabeth is a character in tv-series &quot;The Serpent Queen&quot; season 2 and is portrayed as an adult by actress Laura Marcus.

Elisabeth appears in the historical novel &quot;The Spanish Bridegroom&quot; by British author Jean Plaidy. In the novel the young Elisabeth is torn between her love and duty to Philip and her strong relationship with her stepson, the mentally unstable Don Carlos. In private, she is appalled by the activities of the Inquisition and other rigid aspects of Spanish life, and secretly conspires with Carlos and her ladies to find ways around the harsher laws and judgements.

<doc id="956138" wikidata="Q1542172" url="?curid=956138" title="Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Melodic Rap Performance (awarded as Best Rap/Sung Collaboration until 2017, and Best Rap/Sung Performance from 2018 to 2020) is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs on which rappers and singers collaborate. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The name and definition of the category were changed in June 2020, with immediate effect, to represent the inclusivity of the growing hybrid performance trends within the rap genre. According to the Recording Academy, &quot;This category is intended to recognize solo and collaborative performances containing elements of rap and melody over modern production. This performance requires a strong and clear presence of melody combined with rap cadence, and is inclusive of dialects, lyrics or performance elements from non-rap genres including R&amp;B, rock, country, electronic or more. The production may include traditional elements of rap or elements characteristic of the aforementioned non-rap genres.&quot;

The award goes to the artist(s). The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.

American rapper Eve and American singer Gwen Stefani won the first award in 2002 with &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot;. The pair were also nominated a second time in 2006 for &quot;Rich Girl&quot;. American rapper Jay-Z has received seven Grammys in the category— four times as lead artist and three times as featured artist; he has also been nominated for three other songs. Rihanna is the female artist with the most wins in the category, with five wins out of nine total nominations.

<text>Ballynahinch () is a town in County Down, Northern Ireland. It had a population of 6,164 people in the 2021 census.

Ballynahinch was traditionally a market town, and the market still takes place in the square every Thursday. The town lies on the main A24 road from Belfast to Clough, near Newcastle. Facilities in the town include a leisure centre. In recent years a regeneration committee has been formed for the development of the town and the surrounding Spa and Drumaness areas.

== History ==
Prior to the 17th century, the area around Ballynahinch was controlled by the McCartan clan. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, Catholic military officer Patrick McCartan captured a Parliamentarian-controlled castle in Downpatrick. After he was captured, McCartan was executed in 1653 and his lands were confiscated by the Parliamentarian authorities and sold to Sir George Rawdon, an associate of Sir William Petty. Prior to his death in 1678, Petty leased his interest in the former McCartan lands purchased by Rawdon, leaving the latter in sole possession of the estate; Rawdon subsequently ordered the construction of two gristmills on the estate and established the town of Ballynahinch, which was founded with a market square. In 1683, King Charles II granted a royal patent to Ballynahinch allowing it the right to open the market square on Thursdays and hold two fairs every 1 February and 29 June.

Settlers from lowland Scotland increased the population and Ballynahinch grew as a market town with the sale of livestock, corn, potatoes and increasingly, flax was being cultivated. Sir John Rawdon, descendant of Sir George and now the Earl of Moira took up residence in Montalto house in Ballynahinch. He made significant improvements to the estate and to the town by promoting the linen market and causing Ballynahinch Market House to be built. By the end of the eighteenth century sales in the market were grossing around £300 per week and the town was prospering.

The Society of United Irishmen launched a rebellion in 1798. It began in Leinster and quickly spread to Ulster. The United Irishmen had been founded in 1791 by liberal Protestants in Belfast. Its goal was to unite Catholics and Protestants and make Ireland an independent republic. Although its membership was mainly Catholic, many of its leaders and members in northeast Ulster were Protestant. The Battle of Ballynahinch began on 12 June 1798, when about 4,000 United Irishmen stationed at Ballynahinch were attacked by a government force led by George Nugent. Nugent&#x27;s forces bombarded the town with cannon for a full day until the United Irishmen retreated. Following this, the victorious troops burnt sixty-three houses in Ballynahinch and its hinterland. The commander of the United Irishmen, Henry Munro, was betrayed, captured and executed shortly after.

Montalto and Ballynahinch was sold in 1802 to David Ker Esq. who took advantage of the rising fashion for &#x27;taking the waters&#x27; amongst tourists with money and developed the medicinal spa wells just over two miles outside the town. The village continued to expand thereafter. In mid-1920, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks at Ballynahinch was subject to a bomb attack by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). On 16 October 1986 Terence Mullan age 31 and Kathleen Mullan age 79, both Catholic civilians, were shot dead by the Ulster Freedom Fighters at their home, Dromore Road, Ballynahinch. Then British Prime Minister John Major visited Ballynahinch in December 1996. Ballynahinch is the site of Montalto Estate, Montalto House and The Carriage Rooms. The latter of which was the setting for Disney&#x27;s The Lodge.

==Transport==

===Traffic congestion===
The town is well known for its heavy congestion. A bypass is proposed for the town. Geological surveys were conducted over twenty years ago to determine the route of the bypass but money has never been allocated by the Department of the Environment. In the 1990s various traffic control measures were introduced including the present one way system, however all have failed to cope with the sheer volume of traffic which passes through the town daily, particularly evenings.

In January 2012 The Minister for Regional Development made the following announcement:
&quot;Roads Service approved the stage 2 preferred options report for the scheme, including the recommendation for a preferred line for the A24 Ballynahinch bypass scheme around the eastern outskirts and adjacent to the development limit of the town. That line will run from the junction of the A24 Belfast Road and the A21 Saintfield Road, which is north of the town, to the junction of the A24 Drumaness Road and the B2 Downpatrick Road, which is south of the town, at a distance of approximately 3.1 km. The scheme will involve substantial earthworks to traverse the drumlin topography and ground conditions along the route, which includes the flood plain of the Ballynahinch River. Three substantial structures will be required where the route crosses Moss Road, Crossgar Road and the Ballynahinch river.&quot; There will also be a junction with the B7 Crossgar Road.

However this just shows the advanced nature of the planning rather than imminent construction; The official position is still that construction will take place between 2014 and 2019.

<doc id="956147" wikidata="Q377956" url="?curid=956147" title="Silvio Rodríguez">
<text>Silvio Rodríguez Domínguez (born 29 November 1946) is a Cuban musician, and leader of the Nueva Trova movement.

He is widely considered as Cuba&#x27;s best folk singer and arguably one of Latin America&#x27;s greatest singer-songwriters. Known for his intellectual, highly eloquent and symbolic lyrics, his songs are iconic elements of Latin American left-leaning popular culture. Many of his songs have become classics in Latin American music, such as &quot;Ojalá&quot;, &quot;Playa Girón&quot;, &quot;Unicornio&quot;, &quot;Sueño con Serpientes&quot;, &quot;Vamos a andar,&quot; and &quot;La maza&quot;. Among his other well-known songs are political anthems like &quot;Fusil contra fusil&quot; and &quot;Canción del Elegido&quot;, and poetic melodies like &quot;A donde van&quot; and &quot;Noche sin fin y mar&quot;. He has released over 20 albums.

Rodríguez, musically and politically, is a symbol of the Latin American left. His lyrics are notably introspective, while his songs combine romanticism, eroticism, existentialism, revolutionary politics and idealism. As a humanist, his songs often bespeak a secular worldview, where humanity must make the best of this world.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood ===
Rodríguez was born on 29 November 1946 in San Antonio de los Baños, a fertile valley in Havana Province known for its tobacco crop. He was raised in a family of poor farmers. His father, Víctor Dagoberto Rodríguez Ortega, was a farmer and amateur poet who supported socialist causes. His mother, Argelia Domínguez León, was a housewife. During her adolescence, she was a part of a singing duo with sister Orquídea Domínguez, with whom she participated in many radio broadcasts and cultural events. The first of his mother&#x27;s songs that Rodríguez recalls hearing is &quot;El colibrí,&quot; a Cuban folk song that he would later sing during many of his tours. On many occasions, Rodríguez has spoken how his love of music was developed by his mother, who would pass time singing boleros and songs from Santiago. Later, she also collaborated with him on a few musical works. One of his uncles, Ramiro Domínguez, was a professional musician and a member of the group Jazz Band Mambí. This musical environment, which began with grandmother María León and her husband Felíx Domínguez, lovers of the trova musical style, inspired Rodríguez to take an interest in music during his childhood.

Rodríguez was just two years old when he began singing for his father&#x27;s friends. A few years later, he participated in the music competition &quot;Buscando una estrella&quot; (&quot;Looking for a Star&quot;), hosted by the now-defunct Cuban radio station CMQ. He was invited a few days later to participate in a musical competition for children held by the same station, this time directed by the well-known announcer Germán Pinelli. This time, he won first place for singing the bolero &quot;Viajera&quot; (&quot;Traveler&quot;). 

When he was five years old, Silvio and his family moved to Havana due to a better job opportunity for his father in the tapestry business. In the capital, he participated in a radio event with the theme &quot;We are Happy Today.&quot; He received his first instrument, a conga drum, from his uncle Ramiro. He would use it to imitate the rhythms of Benny Moré and the Orquesta Aragón.

In 1953, at the age of seven years old and the beginning of the Cuban Revolution, his father enrolled him in the La Milagrosa Conservatory. There, he passed the introductory class and the first piano course, given by Margarita Pérez Picó, within six months. However, in spite of Pérez&#x27;s enthusiasm, Silvio lost interest and dropped out of the course after a short time. At nine years old and motivated by his father, who read him poems by José Martí and Rubén Darío, among others, he took an interest in literature, paying attention to the work of both poets, as well as the genre of science fiction. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;The Little Prince&quot; remained one of his favorite books in adulthood.

At the age of ten years old, Rodríguez&#x27;s parents divorced, and he temporarily returned to his hometown with his mother and sister. The two years that followed this event would be immortalized later in various songs published between 1969 and 1984, such as &quot;El Papalote&quot; or &quot;Me veo claramente&quot;. However, his parents reconciled in 1958 and decided to move back to the capital, specifically to 530 San Miguel Street, in the city center.

=== Adolescence ===
On January 1, 1959, when Rodríguez was thirteen years old, Fidel Castro&#x27;s Éjercito Rebelde brought an end to the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. This event shaped the musical life of the singer-songwriter and coincided with his transition from childhood into adolescence. Like many Cubans of his generations, he became involved with the new revolutionary enthusiasm. Despite regularly traveling between his hometown and the capital, he enlisted in the San Antonio de los Baños chapter of the Association of Socialist Youth, created by Che Guevara. In parallel to his participation in this organization, Rodríguez enrolled in night school at the Carlos J. Finnay school to study for the bachillerato, a post-secondary degree. There, he became friends with Vicente Feliú, another future member of the Nueva Trova movement. 

The following year, amid social tension due to Cuba&#x27;s nationalization of businesses and the United States&#x27; embargo, his parents separated once again, this time indefinitely. Argelia, who at this time worked at home as a hairdresser, married a man named Rolando and moved to 456 Gervasio Street, near Dagoberto. Silvio took an interest in classical music during this time.

In January 1961, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Cuba following the election of president John F. Kennedy, who authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to invade the country. On April 15, bombings began in Havana, Santiago de Cuba, and San Antonio de los Baños, to which the family had recently returned despite the protests of Silvio, who had recently joined his school&#x27;s militia. The return to his hometown was an opportunity for Silvio to assume new responsibilities, passing from adolescence to young adulthood.

=== Young adulthood ===
One of the first social goals of the Cuban Revolution was to drastically reduce the rate of illiteracy in the country. In one year, it was able to reduce the rate from 23.6% to 3.9%. Though still a minor, he participated as a member of the Conrado Benítez Literacy Brigades in the Escambray Mountains. There, he helped give the campesinos classes in history, geography, grammar, and mathematics, as well as explaining elements of the new government, such as the Agrarian Reform plan. In 1961, during one of the campaigns, Rodríguez ingested a toxic plant, suffering second-degree burns that forced him to return to Havana. 

Once again in the capital, he met the caricaturists Virgilio Martínez and José Luis Posada, who worked for &quot;Mella,&quot; a communist magazine. He began to collaborate with the magazine in early 1962. He met the writers Víctor Casaus and Luis Rogelio Nogueras, who would later write a book, &quot;Silvio: que levante la mano la guitarra&quot;&quot;,&quot; later adapted into a film of the same name. Rodríguez began to read the works of Federico García Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Guillén, Edgar Allan Poe, and Walt Whitman. In the magazine, Rodríguez became well known for his work as illustrator for the series &quot;El hueco.&quot; One of his colleagues, Lázaro Fundora, played the guitar as a hobby and taught Rodríguez the first chords of the instrument that would become a key part of his future work.

In 1963, with the birth of his second sister, Anabell López, the daughter of his mother and Rolando, Rodríguez began his studies in painting at the School of San Alejandro, in Havana. He also returned to the piano classes he had abandoned in his childhood, this time under the guidance of Elvira Fabre Obregón. 

At 17 years old in 1964, he was required to participate in compulsory military service. He joined the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR), where he would meet Esteban Baños, a member of his unit who gave him further instruction in playing the guitar. It was in the Managua military encampment that Rodríguez composed his first songs, which he played for the other soldiers. His first songs, written in 1964 and 1965, were the boleros ¨Saudade&quot; and &quot;La cascada,&quot; both about love; later, he wrote &quot;Atavismo&quot;, &quot;Nuestra ciudad&quot;, &quot;Es sed&quot;, &quot;Te vas&quot;, and &quot;La otra presencia&quot;. His interest in protest songs came shortly after this period. At the same time, he worked as an illustrator for the Art and Science section of the magazine &quot;Venceremos&quot;, which was published by the political section of the Army. In 1965, he transferred to the magazine &quot;Verde Olive&quot;, where he remained until the end of his military service, working during the day and teaching himself the guitar at night.

In 1967, just before completing his military service, Rodríguez won an honorary mention in the literary competition of the FAR for his book of poems &quot;Honradado Cuaderno No. 1&quot;. At the end of this period, Rodríguez began his prolific music career.

== Music career ==

=== Television career ===
Rodríguez made his musical debut in front of the general public on June 13, 1967 in the television program &quot;Música y estrellas&quot;, invited to perform by musical director Mario Romeu. On that occasion, Rodríguez performed &quot;Es sed&quot;, &quot;Sueño del colgado y la tierra&quot;, and &quot;Quédate&quot;, the latter of which appeared later on his album &quot;Expedición&quot;, released in 2002.

Between November 1967 and mid-1968, he was the host of the television program &quot;Mientras tanto&quot;, named after one of his songs. The program had artists, writers, cinematographers, and new and established artists as guest stars. Among those featured were Bola de Nieve, Omara Portuondo, and Elena Burke, among other influential Cuban artists. Each episode ended with Rodríguez&#x27;s song &quot;Y nada más&quot;, which appeared in his 1978 album &quot;Mujeres.&quot; After the death of Che Guevara in 1967, he wrote the protest songs &quot;¿Por qué?&quot;, and &quot;La leyenda del águila&quot;. Other songs written during this period include &#x27;Ay de mí&#x27;, &#x27;Debajo del cañón&#x27;, &#x27;Déjame regresar&#x27;, &#x27;En busca del tiempo perdido&#x27;, &#x27;En ti&#x27;, &#x27;Graciela&#x27;, &#x27;Grita más&#x27;, &#x27;Hay un grupo que dice&#x27;, &#x27;Los funerales del insecto&#x27;, &#x27;María&#x27;, &#x27;Muerto&#x27;, &#x27;Oye&#x27;, &#x27;Quién va a pensar en algo más&#x27;, &#x27;Si se va la esperanza&#x27;, &#x27;Tema de la adolescencia&#x27;, &#x27;Tengo que estar en ti&#x27;, &#x27;Treinta años&#x27;, &#x27;Tu beso&#x27;, and &#x27;Y anoche&#x27;. Some of these were dedicated to a woman named Emilia, who he viewed as his first important love.

Rodríguez affirms that he has always felt a sense of panic in front of the lights and cameras. However, despite his notoriety for being a nervous television host, his program received a positive reception from the Cuban public.

=== Nueva Trova ===
It wasn&#x27;t until 1967, with his first television experience, that he started to become well-known and influential among Cuban, revolutionary youth. With pro-revolution, yet very independent, lyrics (together with his very informal dress code), Rodríguez soon attracted the animosity of some members of the new Culture Ministry, which was devoted to the eradication of the United States&#x27; influence in Cuban culture. In this context, a very important role was played by the cultural institution Casa de las Américas and its then director Haydée Santamaría, the former a respected revolutionary who participated in the Moncada barracks assault of 1953 and sister of Abel Santamaría, who was tortured and killed after the failure of the assault. Haydée Santamaría became a protective mother-figure of the young composers and of several of his colleagues at the time. Casa de las Américas became the home not only for the new Cuban &quot;trovadores&quot; but also for many other Latin Americans on the left. It was in this institution that Rodríguez met Pablo Milanés, and Noel Nicola, who along with Rodríguez would become the most famous Nueva Trova singers and composers.

In 1969, for almost five months, he worked as part of the crew on the fishing boat Playa Girón, and during this fertile episode he wrote 62 songs, among which are the famous &quot;Ojalá&quot; and &quot;Playa Girón.&quot; The lyrics and music of these songs became a book named &quot;Canciones del Mar&quot;. In 1976, he decided to join Cuban troops in Angola, playing for the soldiers.

After more than 40 years of artistic work, Rodríguez has now written a vast number of songs and poems (said to be between 500 and more than one thousand), many of which have never been set to music and probably never will be. Although his musical knowledge has been continuously increasing (counting among his teachers the famous Cuban composer Leo Brouwer), he is more widely praised for the poetry in his songs than for the accompanying music. His lyrics are a staple of leftist culture throughout the whole Spanish-speaking world, and he has been banned from the media during several of the dictatorial regimes that ruled Latin America in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

His debut album was &quot;Días y flores&quot;, launched in 1975. &quot;Al final de este viaje&quot; and &quot;Cuando digo futuro&quot; feature songs he composed before &quot;Días y flores&quot;. He reached international popularity in the early 1980s with &quot;Rabo de nube&quot; and, in particular, &quot;Unicornio&quot;. In the early part of his career his work displayed a fair amount of revolutionary optimism. &quot;Mujeres&quot;, released in 1979, is in contrast a romantic and highly intimist album. In the middle of his career, Silvio Rodríguez experimented with sounds and rhythms departing from his trademark acoustic guitar, accompanied by the group Afrocuba (e.g. in &quot;Causas y azares&quot;). At maturity, Silvio Rodríguez thoroughly purified his sound through a return to acoustic guitar, great care and sophistication in the voice, and exclusive control of the production process from beginning to end. His lyrics became more introspective, at times even self-absorbed or self-justifying, expressing melancholic longings about the shortcomings of real-life socialism in Cuba while vindicating idealism and revolutionary hope amongst the youth. The trilogy, called &quot;Silvio&quot;, &quot;Rodríguez&quot;, and &quot;Domínguez&quot; (his first name, his father&#x27;s last name, his mother&#x27;s last name) displays sound artistic talent. The doubts, absent in the early part of his career, also correspond to the fall of Soviet communism and the so-called Special Period in Cuba. An unnoticed recurrent theme in the lyrics of the early part of his career is that of death, particularly although not only as associated with guerrilla warfare. In contrast to the explicitness of his early songs and political positions, there was a displacement of emphasis in his later years toward fantasy and dreams. Both, however, are about an alternative that is not present but is called for, or what Laclau would call a longing for a &quot;missing fullness&quot;. This is true politically, romantically, and existentially. In a similar way, the unusual confessional tone of many of his songs allows for an unorthodox combination of transgression, eroticism, longing, and at times (probably accurate) self-deprecation in many of his lyrics.

The entire work of Silvio Rodríguez offers an intimate and introspective window into the life cycle of the artist. If the lyrics of the early part of his career are about revolutionary enthusiasm, love encounters and disappointments, as well as sensual desire, and if the middle-aged Silvio is more self-questioning, often looking backward; his most recent albums, such as &quot;Cita con ángeles&quot;, talk in part about his life as a grandfather and has a certain focus on children, while &quot;Érase que se era&quot; is the release (with all the means that come with being an established artist) of songs written early in his youth but never previously recorded. &quot;Mariposas&quot; also featured two classics composed in his youth.

Silvio Rodríguez stands out in the Spanish-speaking world for the intimacy and subtlety of his lyrics, as well as for his acoustic melodies and &quot;chord picking.&quot; He is particularly popular amongst intellectual circles of the left in Latin America and Spain. He has also often served as Cuban cultural emissary in events of solidarity, whether in Chile (&quot;Silvio Rodríguez in Chile&quot;, 1990) or Argentina (En vivo en Argentina, recorded in 1984), both massive concerts given shortly after the fall of the right-wing dictatorships. Cuban flags are always conspicuous in the crowd during his concerts. Chilean audiences had become familiar with Silvio Rodríguez through the circulation of clandestine pirate cassettes in the 1980s.

In 2007, he received a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos in Peru. (Lima, Peru).

Rodríguez has been a major influence on many folk artists, including the Swedish artist José González.

==U.S. appearance==
Silvio Rodríguez has been denied a United States visa several times, and it was particularly controversial in 2009 when he was invited to celebrate the 90th birthday of Pete Seeger. However, in 2010, he obtained a visa and performed at venues in Puerto Rico (30 May), New York (4 and 10 June), Oakland, (12 June), Los Angeles (17 June), Washington, D.C. (19 June) and Orlando (23 June). These were his first appearances in the United States in 30 years.

<doc id="956149" wikidata="Q1857620" url="?curid=956149" title="Ryan Idol">
<text>Ryan Idol (born August 10, 1966) is an American gay pornographic film actor who performed in the 1990s and later onstage in mainstream theater. He has French, Irish, and Native American ancestry. Idol describes himself as &quot;the creation of Marc Anthony Donais&quot;.

==Biography==
Idol was raised in a series of foster homes as a child. He never knew his father, and had little contact with his mother while growing up.

After high school, Idol spent a brief period in the United States Navy, then worked as a construction worker. To generate income, he began stripping for women in nightclubs in New England. He was approached to do a nude layout for &quot;Playgirl&quot;, and in February 1989 appeared as the &quot;Man of the Month&quot; centerfold under his birth name Marc Anthony Donais. This appearance launched his career in the adult film industry, in which he achieved notoriety and success under the name Ryan Idol. At the height of his career, he claimed to earn $50,000 per film, and made tens of thousands of dollars more stripping at gay clubs around the United States. He also engaged in a limited amount of prostitution. He retired from adult films in 1996.

On March 20, 1998, Idol was seriously injured after jumping through a window of his fourth-floor apartment in New York City in an attempted suicide. He considers the fall to be a &quot;near-death experience&quot;. Idol has stated that he doesn&#x27;t recall jumping but that &quot;the drugs and alcohol took over&quot;.

Moving into theater acting, in 1999, Idol starred in the play &quot;Making Porn&quot;. Idol next played &quot;Bill Tom&quot; in the play &quot;Scent of Rain&quot; (subtitled &quot;Scent of Rain: A Love Story Really!&quot;), written by Mark Dunn, for which he was lauded for &quot;continu[ing] to establish himself as a capable actor&quot;. Idol made his Broadway debut when he played the &quot;Crisco Patron&quot; in the Roundabout Theater Company&#x27;s 2007 revival of Terrence McNally&#x27;s &quot;The Ritz&quot;.

Regarding his sexuality, Idol stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t like to label myself... I&#x27;d just like to say I&#x27;m a loving person. I can love a man and I can love a woman.&quot;

==Legal charges== 
Donais&#x27; legal troubles started in 1987 when he was in the U.S. Navy stationed in Hawaii. After only serving 11 months he was court martialed and convicted of assault and battery on an officer. Donais did time in the Brig and received a dishonorable discharge from the Navy. 
Court documents related to a lawsuit filed by HealthSouth over allegations of misuse of funds donated to Birmingham, Alabama, Mayor Larry Langford&#x27;s Computer Help for Kids charity mentioned Idol under his real name. The papers showed that $30,000 was paid to Idol, with $5,000 coming from the charity and $25,000 from the Council of Cooperating Governments. Charity director John Katopodis testified in a deposition that Idol was paid to repair computers and to set up computer giveaway programs in other areas. Idol testified that, because of his 1998 fall, he was &quot;not at [his] full faculties&quot; and could not recall the details of his time with the organization.

A Sacramento Superior Court jury convicted Idol on September 20, 2011, of attempted murder for smashing his girlfriend over the head with a toilet tank lid. He was also convicted of battery, assault with a deadly weapon and &quot;corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant&quot;. Sentencing was scheduled for December 9, 2011; however when he appeared, his attorney requested to withdraw from the case. The request was granted. Idol then appeared in court on January 13, 2012, requesting a retrial &quot;citing ineffective assistance of counsel&quot;. He was sentenced to 12 years in state prison September 27, 2012. He is housed at the California Medical Facility (CMF) in Vacaville, California, a facility for mentally ill prisoners, due to bad behavior, fighting, and drugs. Due to a 3-strikes record, he is eligible for a 25-years-to-life sentence if convicted for certain felonies, so he chose a deal to complete his entire sentence instead of getting a new charge. Kept in protective custody, his current release date is August 2023.

<text>Samuel Rutherford Crockett (24 September 1859 – 16 April 1914), who published under the name &quot;S. R. Crockett&quot;, was a Scottish novelist.

== Life and work ==
He was born at Little Duchrae, Balmaghie, Kirkcudbrightshire, Galloway, on 24 September 1859, the illegitimate son of dairymaid Annie Crocket. He was raised by his Cameronian grandparents on the tenanted farm until 1867 when the family moved to Cotton Street, Castle Douglas (later fictionalised as Cairn Edward). He won the Galloway bursary to Edinburgh University in 1876, where he studied for an MA. He began his journalistic career to supplement his bursary, writing for magazines from 1877. He left University in April 1879 without formally graduating. He travelled throughout Europe as a tutor between the years 1879 and 1881 returning to study for the ministry at Edinburgh&#x27;s New College. He became minister of The Free Kirk Penicuik in November 1886. He married Ruth Mary Milner (daughter of George Milner) on March 10, 1887. He played a large part in gaining justice for the relatives of victims in the Mauricewood Pit Disaster of 1889. He became a member of the Scottish Arts Club in 1894. He left the ministry in January 1895 to pursue a full-time writing career.

The Crocketts had four children: Maisie Rutherford, Philip Hugh Barbour, George Milner and Margaret Douglas, all of whom featured in his children&#x27;s fictions. The family moved from Bank House, Penicuik in 1906 to Torwood House, Peebles, but Crockett spent much of the year abroad and also regularly returned to Galloway.

He published a volume of poetry, &quot;Dulce Cor&quot; (Latin: &quot;Sweet Heart&quot;), under the pseudonym Ford Brereton in 1886. Dulce Cor is a ruined abbey in Galloway. In the late 1880s, he was a regular contributor to &quot;The Christian Leader&quot; magazine, under W. H. Wylie. In 1893 he was noticed by William Robertson Nicoll, and introduced to publisher T. Fisher Unwin who published a first collection of short stories and sketches under the title &quot;The Stickit Minister and some common men&quot; in 1893. It was an instant success, going into six editions within the year. He was taken on by leading London literary agent A. P. Watt, who managed his career until his death. There followed extensive publications across a range of journals, magazines, and periodicals in the UK and America and most of his 60+ serial works were subsequently published in novel form through James Clarke and Co, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, and others.
His contemporary J. M. Barrie had already created a demand for stories in Lowland Scots, with his sketches of Thrums in the late 1880s. R. L. Stevenson a corresponding friend of both writers, described the relationship thus: &quot;you are out of doors and Barrie is indoors&quot; in a letter in 1893.

Crockett&#x27;s breakthrough year occurred in 1894 when T. Fisher Unwin published no fewer than four of his works, &quot;The Raiders&quot;, &quot;The Lilac Sunbonnet&quot;, &quot;The PlayActress&quot; and &quot;Mad Sir Uchtred of the Hills&quot;.

Crockett was one of the new breed of professional writers emerging in the late 19th century whose work was written for the emerging popular &quot;mass market&quot; readership. As one of the foremost celebrity authors, he divided literary critics both his own time and subsequently. His fellow late-nineteenth-century novelist George Gissing for instance found his novel &quot;The Raiders&quot; &quot;wearisome&quot;. His early work was dismissed by some contemporary critics as Kailyard and it was a label that has proved hard to shift. The stigma associated with it has seen his work overlooked for many years. A reappraisal of the nebulous connection with Kailyard is beginning to be acknowledged, as evidenced by a re-appraisal of the whole Kailyard concept by writers such as Andrew Nash. The mid-20th century view that his later work was &quot;over-prolific and feebly sentimental&quot; is now being challenged. His work is much less easy to categorise than such simplification suggests, not least because it is so extensive. Most broadly it falls into an historical adventure romance genre. However, he also wrote of contemporary issues, largely from a rural perspective. He championed the rural working classes and was outspoken against all forms of hierarchy. While many of his stories are set in rural Galloway, there are also stories set in Edinburgh, Scotland, England, France, Spain, and further abroad. In the late 1890s he was commissioned to write many introductions (including Blackwood&#x27;s 1895 edition of John Galt) and, for children, versions of Sir Walter Scott stories (&quot;Red Cap Tales&quot; and &quot;Red Cap Adventures&quot;). He wrote nonfiction as well, including a booklet published by the London camera manufacturer, Newman &amp; Guardia, in 1900, comparing cameras favourably to pen and pencil and explaining how he encountered the N and G advertisement. This led to the publications of a nonfiction work &quot;The Adventurer in Spain&quot; (1903) which he illustrated along with Gordon Browne. His non fiction work &quot;Raiderland&quot; (1904) takes the reader into the Galloway of his youth. He was an early adopter of the typewriter. His novel &quot;Vida&quot; (1908) first serialised in &quot;The People&#x27;s Friend&quot; in 1907, features what is arguably the first car chase in fiction.

In his youth, he was a mountaineer and had an interest in astronomy.

Crockett died in Tarascon, France, on 16 April 1914 and was buried at Balmaghie Kirk on April 24 that year. A memorial to him was erected in Laurieston by public subscription in 1932. Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) was a benefactor.

Most of Crockett&#x27;s work is now back in print.

In 2014 Ayton Publishing Limited published the 32-volume &quot;Galloway Collection&quot;, in time for the centenary of his death.

==Legacy and influence==
*A monument to Crockett can be seen at Laurieston, near Castle Douglas, Kirkcudbrightshire. It was designed by architect Thomas Peach Weir Young and unveiled in 1932.
*Crockett&#x27;s 1901 novel &quot;Cinderella&quot; was filmed in 1922 as &quot;A Lowland Cinderella&quot; and was directed by Sidney Morgan and starred Joan Morgan.
*&quot;The Lilac Sunbonnet&quot; was adapted for the screen in 1923 and was directed by Sidney Morgan and starred Joan Morgan, Warwick Ward and Pauline Peters.
*In 2014 The Galloway Raiders was set up as a literary society and online presence to explore his life and work and restore his credibility as one of Scotland&#x27;s great writers. The Galloway Raiders also holds two archives of Crockett material; that of his biographer Dr Islay Donaldson, &#x27;The Donaldson Archive&#x27;; and Crockett scholar Richard D. Jackson, &#x27;The Jackson archive&#x27;.
*Some papers are held by Edinburgh University. Their website information is inaccurate in many respects including both birth and death dates.
*A biography was published in 1989 by Dr Islay Donaldson: &quot;The Life and Works of Samuel Rutherford Crockett&quot; and republished in 2016. 
*J. R. R. Tolkien credits him as an influence on his wolf-fight scenes: &quot;the episode of the &#x27;wargs&#x27; (I believe) is in part derived from a scene in S. R. Crockett&#x27;s &quot;The Black Douglas&quot;, probably his best romance and anyway one that deeply impressed me in school-days&quot;.

==Published works==

The current most comprehensive list of Crockett&#x27;s published work in book form amounts to 66 and is derived from Donaldson and &quot;The Complete Crockett&quot;. Details of original UK and US publishers are given where known. A substantial number of works have been republished since the 100th anniversary of his death and are available as print or digital versions. Most comprehensive is &quot;The Galloway Collection&quot;. Given the ephemerality of magazine publication it is impossible to give a complete list of all his serialised work or published short stories.

<doc id="956156" wikidata="Q1123766" url="?curid=956156" title="Grammy Award for Best Rap Song">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rap Song is an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality songs in the rap music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented to Eminem along with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto for the song &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; from the soundtrack &quot;8 Mile&quot; in 2004. According to the 54th Grammy Awards description guide, the award honors the songwriter(s) of new songs (containing both music and lyrics) or songs &quot;first achieving prominence during the period of eligibility&quot;. Songs containing prominent samples may be eligible. The award goes to the songwriter(s), not to the artist except when the artist is also a songwriter of the winning song.

Kanye West holds the records for the most wins and nominations in this category, having won seven times out of sixteen nominations. West, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams, Drake and Kendrick Lamar are the only songwriters to have won the category more than once. Cyhi the Prynce holds the record for most nominations without a win, with six.

<text>Leon Collins (February 7, 1922 - April 16, 1985) was an American tap dancer.

Collins was born Leandre Kollins in Chicago, Illinois to a father of West Indian descent. He began tap dancing at an early age, but he wanted to be a prizefighter. As a teenager, Collins performed with worked with Count Basie&#x27;s orchestra, the bands of Erksine Hawkins, Earl Hines, and Tito Puente. By the age of seventeen, he relocated to Detroit, where he married blues singer Tina Dixon. The couple moved to New York City where Dixon, who was signed to perform with the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra, recommended that Collins perform with the orchestra when the opening act called out sick. Impressed by his performance, Lunceford signed Collins to a five-year contract.

As work opportunities dried out when rock and roll became popular and big bands became less in demand, he learned to play the guitar, and attended the Berklee School of Music in Boston. By the early 1960s, he was forced to give up dance entirely and during this interim, restored cars for fourteen years until tap dance began to experience a revival. At the urging of people like Tina Pratt and Stanley Brown, he came out of retirement and began to teach. In 1976, he performed with other retired dancers in a tap revival show at Boston&#x27;s New England Life Hall, which led to new opportunities. He opened a studio with Boston&#x27;s First Lady of Jazz, Mae Arnette. The studio, Star Steps Studio, was located in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston.

In 1982, the studio moved to Brookline and a new partnership was formed. Leon and three of his students, Clara Brosnaham &quot;CB&quot; Hetherington, Dianne Walker and Pamela Raff opened the Leon Collins Dance Studio Inc. During this time, Leon formed a company with his students and Joan Hill (pianist). Leon Collins &amp; Co. performed mainly in the New England area from 1982 until his untimely death in 1985. He had a few bit parts in the movies and is known for his exceptional tap dancing and teaching. He was best known for his work with jazz and bebop and in his latter years his work with classical music, in particular, his rendition of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot;.

A documentary produced by David Wadsworth, &quot;Songs Unwritten&quot;, was filmed about Collins and released shortly after his death. He died of lung cancer in Boston in 1985.

Collins was inducted into the Tap Dance Hall of Fame in 2007.

<doc id="956166" wikidata="Q457622" url="?curid=956166" title="Deborah Cox">
<text>Deborah Cox (born July 13, 1974) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, actress, and record producer. Born and raised in Toronto, she began performing on television commercials at age 12, and entered various talent shows in her teenage years before becoming a professional backing vocalist for Celine Dion. In 1994, Cox relocated to the United States and was signed to Arista Records by Clive Davis, releasing her self-titled debut album the following year. Her second studio album, &quot;One Wish&quot; (1998), was certified platinum in the United States. It was marked by the commercial success of the pop crossover single &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Supposed to Be Here&quot;, which would become her most successful entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, peaking at number two and remaining there for eight consecutive weeks. Cox signed with J Records for her third studio album &quot;The Morning After&quot; (2002), which saw moderate commercial success.

Cox ventured into acting in the 2000s, making her film debut in the Canadian drama film &quot;Love Come Down&quot; (2000) and her stage debut in 2004, in the title role in the Broadway musical &quot;Aida&quot;. She has since appeared in smaller films and several musical productions, including the horror-drama &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot;, the biographical musical &quot;Josephine&quot;, the musical adaptation of &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, and the 2023 revival of &quot;The Wiz&quot;. Cox&#x27;s most recent studio albums, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Promise&quot; (2008), have been released through her own independent record label, Deco Recording Group. In 2017, her single &quot;Let the World Be Ours Tonight&quot; became her 13th number-one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs over the span of three consecutive decades. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed Cox at 23rd on its list of the Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists. An eight-time Juno Award nominee, she has won four awards and is often cited as Canada&#x27;s top R&amp;B artist. She received her first Grammy Award nomination for &quot;The Wiz&quot; in the Best Musical Theater Album category.

Cox was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2022.

==Early life==
Deborah Cox was born in Toronto to parents of Guyanese descent, grew up in Scarborough, was raised Catholic, and attended John XXIII Catholic Elementary School and Earl Haig Secondary School. She began singing on TV commercials at age 12, and entered various talent shows including an appearance on &quot;Tiny Talent Time&quot;. She performed in nightclubs as a teenager, and began to write music around the same time. Cox entered the music industry in the early 1990s, performing as a backup vocalist for Celine Dion for six months. In 1992, she also appeared on Devon&#x27;s LP titled &quot;It&#x27;s My Nature&quot; on the track &quot;That&#x27;s A Friend.&quot; After receiving many rejection letters from Canadian record labels that claimed their &quot;quota&quot; had been reached, Cox moved to Los Angeles in 1994 with producer and songwriting partner, Lascelles Stephens.

==Career==
===1995–1999: Debut and &quot;One Wish&quot;===
In 1995, label executive Clive Davis signed Cox to Arista Records. Featuring production from Dallas Austin, Keith Crouch, Tim &amp; Bob, and Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, she released her self-titled debut album the same year. A middling commercial and critical success, the album peaked at number 102 on US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 but emerged as a steady seller, eventually receiving a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), while going platinum in Canada. Lead single &quot;Sentimental&quot; entered the top five on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, while follow-up &quot;Who Do U Love&quot; attained worldwide success, becoming a top twenty success in Australia, New Zealand and the US, also reaching the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs. In 1996, &quot;Deborah Cox&quot; won Cox a Juno Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Recording at the annual award ceremony and earned her a Best Soul/R&amp;B New Artist nomination at the 1996 American Music Awards.

Cox contributed the non-album song &quot;Things Just Ain&#x27;t The Same&quot; to the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Money Talks&quot;. A dance remix of the song, produced by Hex Hector, became her second number-one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart and was included on her second album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;One Wish&quot;. As with her self-titled debut album, her sophomore effort was once again executive-produced by Davis, but featured more uptempo, contemporary R&amp;B, and a slew of new producers and personnel to incorporate dance and club music, including Montell Jordan, Anthony &quot;Shep&quot; Crawford, Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, and DJ Quik. &quot;One Wish&quot; peaked at number 72 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and earned a platinum certification from the RIAA, while reaching gold status in Canada. The album capitalized on the crossover success of lead single &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Supposed to Be Here&quot; which became Cox&#x27;s most successful entry on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number two, and remaining there for eight consecutive weeks, making it one of the longest stays at number two in chart history. The song also reached number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, spending a then record-breaking 14 weeks at number one, while the third single &quot;We Can&#x27;t Be Friends,&quot; a duet with R. L. Huggar, reached the top ten, with &quot;It&#x27;s Over Now&quot; and &quot;I Never Knew&quot; become chart-toppers on the Dance Club Songs chart.

===2000–2005: &quot;The Morning After&quot; and acting career===
After &quot;One Wish&quot;, Cox collaborated with singer Whitney Houston on her single &quot;Same Script, Different Cast&quot; from the compilation album &quot;&quot;. Incorporating a backing track of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Für Elise&quot; during the intro, it was released as a radio-only promo single and became a minor hit on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 70 while reaching number 14 on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 2000, Cox made her acting debut when she starred in Clement Virgo&#x27;s Canadian drama film &quot;Love Come Down&quot;, playing a nightclub singer. The film garnered eight nominations at the 21st Genie Awards, including two Best Original Song nominations for Cox&#x27;s songs &quot;29&quot; and &quot;Our Love&quot;. In 2001, Cox then recorded &quot;Absolutely Not&quot;, for the soundtrack to &quot;Dr. Dolittle 2&quot; which became her sixth number one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs.

Cox&#x27;s third album &quot;The Morning After&quot; was released in November 2002 on J Records following a frustratingly long departure from Arista. It marked the Cox&#x27;s first record under Clive Davis&#x27;s label, with Davis, once more serving as executive producer. Keen to build on the success of her previous album &quot;One Wish&quot;, he enlisted the help of producers such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Jermaine Dupri, Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, and Shep Crawford as well as up-and-coming producers Warryn Campbell, Johntá Austin and Alex Richbourg to work with Cox. A blend of urban R&amp;B and adult contemporary songs with additional dance/house tracks, it became her highest-charting album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums yet, debuting and peaking at number 38 and number seven, respectively. Commercially, the album was less successful than her previous album, however, though it produced two singles on the US Dance Club Songs chart, including &quot;Mr. Lonely&quot; and &quot;Play Your Part&quot;.

In February 2004, Cox made her Broadway debut in the Elton John-Tim Rice musical &quot;Aida&quot; when she replaced singer Michelle Williams in her role of the Nubian princess. Her four-month engagement earned largely positive reviews. The same year, she recorded and released a dance remix of the musical&#x27;s theme song &quot;Easy As Life&quot; as a promotional single. In 2005, Cox starred in the films &quot;Blood of a Champion&quot; and &quot;Love on Layaway&quot;. Also that year, her voice was featured in the movie &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; in the song &quot;Nobody Cares&quot;. To sustain demand for Cox&#x27;s club appearances, while focused on her family and new album projects, she released a dance single titled &quot;House Is Not a Home&quot; on Nervous Records in January 2006. Later in the year, her song &quot;Definition of Love&quot; was used in the movie &quot;Akeelah and the Bee&quot;, but was not released as a single.

===2006–2009: &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot;===
Between 2005 and 2006 Deborah recorded her fourth album, called &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, arranged and produced by Rob Mounsey. A tribute album to jazz singer Dinah Washington, Cox noted it a concept album that she had in mind for years. Most of the album was recorded live with a forty-piece orchestra with Rob Mounsey arranging. Eventually released by Decca Records in June 2017, &quot;Destination Moon&quot; peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Jazz Albums. The same year, Cox co-starred alongside Golden Brooks and Darius McCrary in Leslie Small&#x27;s film &quot;A Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;. Based on the musical stage play of the same name, the comedy depicts the story of three women who each undergo romantic crises that challenge their personal and spiritual relationships. In 2008, Cox performed the Canadian national anthem at the NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans, receiving rave reviews. She also contributed the song &quot;This Gift&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2008 romantic drama film &quot;Meet the Browns&quot;, directed by Tyler Perry, and served as a supporting act on Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s True Colors Tour 2008.

Also that year, Cox finished work on her sixth studio album &quot;The Promise&quot;, released on November 11, 2008, through Deco Recording Group, Cox&#x27;s own independent label, with distribution handled by Image Entertainment. A breakaway from her previous album, it marked her return to R&amp;B music and saw her working with a wider number of songwriters and producers on the album, including The Avila Brothers, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Devo Springsteen, Big Jim, and Shep Crawford. 
&quot;The Promise&quot; debuted at number 106 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 14 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and number 95 on the Canadian Albums Chart. Earning generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics, it was nominated for R&amp;B/Soul Recording of the Year at the 2009 Juno Awards. The second single &quot;Beautiful U R&quot; marked her biggest hit since &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Supposed to Be Here,&quot; becoming a top ten hit in Canada, where it was certified platinum by Music Canada, as well as her tenth chart-topper on the &quot;Billboard&quot;″ Dance Club Songs. In support of the album, Cox joined forces with American R&amp;B singer Kenny Lattimore for the joint Timeless Promise Tour in July 2009. Also in 2009, she was featured on the single &quot;Leave the World Behind&quot;, a house track produced by four DJs Axwell, Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso and Laidback Luke.

===2010–2017: The Queen Project, dance music and Broadway===
In 2010, it was announced that Cox would be joining fellow R&amp;B singers Kelly Price and Tamia to form a supergroup. While the trio recorded several tracks together, their joint album &quot;The Queen Project&quot; eventually failed to materialize due timing issues and label politics. In 2011, Cox released the dance-heavy single &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for Love&quot; through Deco Entertainment. It became her eleventh chart topper on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs and was to precede a new studio album which remained unreleased. In September 2012, Cox gave her inaugural performance as the female lead Lucy in a revival of the musical &quot;Jekyll &amp; Hyde&quot; which toured North America for twenty-five weeks. While the show enjoyed a limited Broadway run only, Cox received positive reviews for her performance. Also in 2012, she collaborated with rapper Akon on the song &quot;No Labels&quot;, the official anthem of the same-titled American bipartisan political organization. The following year, Cox collaborated with DJ Paige on the non-album single &quot;Higher&quot;. Released on March 18, through Electronic Kingdom Records, it became her twelfth number-one hit on the US Dance Club Songs chart. In 2014, Cox was one of the performers at the opening ceremonies of WorldPride in Toronto, alongside Melissa Etheridge, Tom Robinson and Steve Grand.

In 2015, she provided vocals for the made for television biographical film &quot;Whitney&quot;, directed by Angela Bassett based on American recording artist Whitney Houston. Cox performed all of Houston&#x27;s vocals in the film, including &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;, and &quot;The Greatest Love of All.&quot; The same year, she released the deep house-influenced &quot;Kinda Miss You&quot;, as well as the ballad &quot;More Than I Knew&quot; as singles. Both were set to appear on her sixth album &quot;Work of Art&quot;, initially announced for an August 2015 release through Deco and Primary Wave Music. However, after several delays, the album remained unreleased. In 2016, Cox played the lead role of Josephine Baker in the Broadway-bound musical &quot;Josephine&quot;, which chronicled the singer&#x27;s life between the years of 1939 and 1945, and starred as Rachel Marron in the North American Tour of the musical &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; based on the 1992 film of the same name. In support of the musical, Cox released the EP &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; on Deco and Broadway Records, containing cover versions of seven Whitney Houston originals as well as Houston&#x27;s cover of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You.&quot; In June 2017, she released an uptempo dance single &quot;Let the World Be Ours Tonight&quot; during LGBTQ pride season on Radikal Records and Galactic Media. It marked her 13th single to top &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs.

===2018–present: Seventh studio album and television films===
In June 2019, Cox performed at Stonewall 50 – WorldPride NYC 2019, marking the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall riots. In November 2019, she released the Rico Love-produced single &quot;Easy Way&quot; through Deco Entertainment. The song was expected to lead her yet-unreleased seventh studio album, initially expected to be released in late 2020. It was followed by the Christmas single &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme Some Christmas&quot; a month later. In February 2020, Cox starred opposite Roger Guenveur Smith in the BET+ television thriller &quot;Influence&quot;, an adaption of Carl Weber&#x27;s same-titled 2018 novel, portraying a big-name celebrity singer accused of killing her husband. Also in 2020, she appeared as a guest host in an episode of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; and started a webseries titled &quot;COXtales with Deborah Cox&quot; during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In fall 2020, Cox released further two Christmas singles, the original song &quot;I Really Don&#x27;t Want Much for Christmas&quot; and a rendition of the Eartha Kitt song &quot;Santa Baby.&quot;

In 2021, Cox was added to the BET series &quot;First Wives Club&quot; during its second season, playing the role of musician Regina alongside Michelle Buteau and Jill Scott. The same year, she co-starred as Wendy in the HBO Max post-apocalyptic dystopian fiction miniseries &quot;Station Eleven&quot;, and appeared on &quot;Summe of Love,&quot; another collaboration with Israeli producer Offer Nissim. In 2022, Cox was announced as an inductee into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, becoming the first Black woman to be inducted.

Beginning in September 2023, Cox starred as Glinda in a US revival of &quot;The Wiz&quot;, touring nationally in advance of a March 2024 Broadway opening.

<text>The Air-Sol Moyenne Portée (&quot;Medium-Range Air-to-Surface&quot;) or ASMP is a French nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile manufactured by MBDA France. In French nuclear doctrine, it serves what is referred to as a &quot;pre-strategic&quot; deterrence role. It is intended to be the ultimate &quot;warning shot&quot; prior to the full-scale employment of the strategic nuclear weapons arming the Triomphant-class ballistic missile submarines. The missile&#x27;s development was undertaken by Aérospatiale&#x27;s missile systems division, whose assets are now part of MBDA.

The ASMP entered service in May 1986. The development of an upgraded version, the ASMP-A, was launched in 1997 and service entry occurred in 2009. In 2016, yet another modernization program, the ASMPA-R, was launched. The first firing test of the ASMPA-R took place in December 2021 and the second in March 2022.

The ASN4G air-launched hypersonic cruise missile, under development as of 2014, is expected to succeed the ASMP from 2035 onwards.

==Development==

===ASMP===
ASMP entered service in May 1986, replacing the earlier free-fall AN-22 bomb on France&#x27;s Dassault Mirage IV aircraft and the AN-52 bomb on Dassault Super Étendard. About 84 weapons are stockpiled. Carrier aircraft are the Dassault Mirage 2000N, Dassault Rafale and Super Étendard. The Mirage IVP carried the ASMP until retired in 1996.

ASMP and ASMP-A are long and weigh . It is a supersonic standoff missile powered by a liquid fuel ramjet. It flies at Mach 2 to Mach 3, with a range between for the ASMP and for the ASMP-A depending on flight profile. The ASMP uses the TN 81 warhead, which has a variable-yield of .

In 1991, 90 missiles and 80 warheads were reported to have been produced. By 2001, 60 of them were reported as operational.

=== ASMP-A===
An upgraded version known as Air-Sol Moyenne Portée-Amélioré (ASMP-A) for (improved ASMP) has a range of about at a speed of up to Mach 3 with the new Tête Nucléaire Aéroportée (TNA) 300 kt thermonuclear warhead. It entered service in October 2009 with the Mirage 2000NK3 of squadron EC 3/4 at Istres and in July 2010 with the Rafales of squadron EC 1/91 at Saint Dizier.
54 ASMP-A have been delivered to French Air and Space Force.

=== ASMPA-R ===
The ASMPA-R (renovated) project, launched in 2016, will see the missile&#x27;s range extended and a new 300kt thermonuclear warhead added. First flight test occurred in December 2021 and the second in March 2022. After entering operational service, it was first fired by the French Air and Space Force as part of the French nuclear exercise &quot;Operation Durandal&quot; in May 2024.

== Successor ==

Studies for the successor to the ASMP missile, currently known as &quot;ASN4G&quot; (Air-Sol Nucléaire de 4ème Génération), a scramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile, were confirmed to have already begun in 2014. The ASN4G will be carried by the Rafale F5 fighter and its successor; the requirement is for a missile range much greater than . The ASN4G is being developed by MBDA France in cooperation with the ONERA.

<text>White Whale Records was an American independent record label, founded in 1965 by Ted Feigin and Lee Lasseff in Los Angeles, California, and probably best known as the record label of the Turtles and a handful of one-hit wonder bands.

White Whale, in addition to releasing almost all of the Turtles&#x27; discography, also released Nino Tempo &amp; April Stevens&#x27;s single &quot;All Strung Out (On You)&quot;, a hit single by Rene y Rene titled &quot;Lo Mucho Que Ti Quiero&quot;, an album by Liz Damon&#x27;s Orient Express, and the only album by Texas band the Clique. Warren Zevon was a staff songwriter for the label, and they issued some of his earliest recordings (as part of the duo Lyme &amp; Cybele). Dobie Gray also recorded for the label, recording the first chart version of &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,&quot; which later became a much bigger hit for Lynn Anderson.

Three compilations of singles from the label have been released on compact disc: &quot;Happy Together: The Very Best of White Whale Records&quot;, and two volumes of the &quot;Phantom Jukebox&quot; series, on Rev-Ola records.

== The Turtles ==
When White Whale signed the Turtles, they were known as &quot;The Crossfires&quot;; a surf music band looking to change their style, as surf music was fading. The label encouraged a name change to &quot;The Tyrtles&quot;, in the manner of The Beatles and The Byrds. The band accepted the new name, but not the variant spelling. Relations between the label and the band were not always smooth, with White Whale pressuring the band for &quot;more hits&quot;, then for singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman to fire the rest of the group, and work instead with hired musicians, in order to save money. Kaylan wrote the song &quot;Elenore&quot; as a humorous take on &quot;Happy Together&quot; (the only No. 1 hit for both the group and the White Whale label), which ironically became a hit itself. He and Volman also democratized the group, insisting everyone share in the writing and vocal duties, despite what the label wanted, and recorded a concept album, &quot;The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands&quot; (on which &quot;Elenore&quot; was featured).

When the Turtles disbanded in the early 1970s, White Whale lost their big moneymaker; in retaliation, and to prevent Kaylan and Volman from continuing their musical careers, White Whale insisted they held the rights to not only the Turtles&#x27; name and back catalog, but Kaylan and Volman&#x27;s individual given names. Kaylan and Volman responded by moving into session work and continuing under a pseudonym, Flo and Eddie; White Whale Records, on the other hand, went out of business not long after. The label&#x27;s final releases were the single &quot;1900 Yesterday&quot; by Liz Damon&#x27;s Orient Express and a self-titled album by the same group; although both charted (the single reaching a respectable No. 33), it was not enough to keep the company going. White Whale&#x27;s assets were sold at auction in 1974, at which point Kaylan and Volman won the rights to the Turtles&#x27; master recordings. Kaylan and Volman would not earn the rights to their own names (or the Turtles&#x27;) again until 1983.

Feigin and Lasseff folded White Whale Records in 1971 and created a new label called Anthem Records (not to be confused with the later Canadian label of the same name.) Anthem was initially distributed in the United States by United Artists. Two White Whale acts were transferred to Anthem (Liz Damon&#x27;s Orient Express and The Dillards), and they are the only artists to have albums issued on the label. The label also provided US distribution for a single by Freddie Mercury under the alias &quot;Larry Lurex&quot;. One of Anthem&#x27;s last signings was the duo of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, whose &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; LP was released via Polydor in 1973. (Polydor issued several albums with credits to &quot;Anthem Record Productions&quot; after the label lost distribution with United Artists the previous year.) Anthem Records was officially dissolved that same year.

== Current ownership ==
While Flo &amp; Eddie Inc (distributed by Manifesto Records) controls the Turtles&#x27; catalog the rest of the White Whale catalog is currently controlled by Concord Music&#x27;s Craft Recordings under Varese Sarabande. Since the 1990s, several CD reissues and compilations of White Whale material have been released.

<text>LBC News is a British digital radio station owned and operated by Global. The sister station of LBC, it broadcasts rolling news 24 hours a day nationwide on DAB and Global Player. The station used to broadcast on analogue radio in Greater London on 1152 AM until Wednesday 30 October 2024.

==History==
The 1152 AM frequency in London has a complicated history of format and ownership. Continuous news radio in London dates from the early 1990s. In September 1993, London News Radio was awarded the AM and FM licences previously held by LBC. They proposed a continuous news service on FM and a news/talk format on AM.

By the time the licence was due to start in October 1994, London News Radio had been through several upheavals, first acquiring LBC and then itself being bought up by Reuters. At launch on 5 October 1994, the company was known as London Radio Services and it operated London News 97.3FM and London News Talk 1152AM. London News initially operated on a 20-minute wheel. The first presenters on air were Michael Wilson and Clare Catford. The morning sequence was presented by LBC veteran Jonathan Staples with Nicky Broyd the afternoon presenter. Drivetime was in the hands of Christopher Terry and Brenda Ellison. John Terrett was the evening host.

By spring 1995, the rolling news format gave way to a more traditional schedule of news sequences and magazine programmes. The station name was shortened to News 97.3 in the summer. In 1996, Reuters sold London Radio Services to the newly formed London News Radio (unrelated to the previous LNR company), in which ITN, DMGT, Reuters and GWR Group held equal shares. In summer 1996, the station reverted to a rolling news format, initially with no name (the station was branded as 97.3FM). In the autumn, following a move to ITN&#x27;s headquarters, the station was relaunched as News Direct 97.3FM and Chris Mann was appointed editor.

In 2000 the station was renamed ITN News Direct 97.3FM. In late 2002, following the sale of the station to Chrysalis Radio, the station dropped the ITN prefix and returned to its previous name until the rebrand as LBC News 1152. During Christmas and New Year 2002/03 an LBC News-branded rolling news service was carried on both 97.3FM and 1152AM prior to the full launches of LBC 97.3 and LBC News 1152, swapping the frequencies of the news and talk stations.

In Spring 2007, it was announced that the station would be replaced by Sky News Radio. This move came alongside Channel 4&#x27;s 4 Digital Group second DAB multiplex bid. On 18 October 2007, the station&#x27;s new owners Global Radio announced that they and Sky had scrapped a joint venture to turn LBC News 1152 into a 24-hour Sky News branded station.

In Summer 2008, the 1152 service was substantially cut back. The overnight automated service was abandoned and replaced with a simulcast of LBC 97.3. The daytime service became semi-automated, with much greater reliance on recorded audio from LBC&#x27;s FM talk station and Sky News. LBC&#x27;s five-and-a-half-year relationship with business news provider Bloomberg was also abandoned in favour of business updates from CNBC. On 15 November 2010, LBC News 1152 was added to the Sky and Virgin Media EPGs, with the station using channel slots formerly occupied by Galaxy Yorkshire. This came six weeks ahead of Galaxy&#x27;s rebranding to Capital FM.

In January and February 2012, the station reverted to live presentation throughout the day with a format of headlines every 15 minutes. For the previous four years parts of the daytime schedule had been automated.

In January 2015, LBC News 1152 changed its name to LBC London News and moved to a 20-minute wheel of news, with headlines at :00, :20 and :40 minutes past each hour, and key presenters including Jim Diamond on breakfast and Chris Golds on drivetime.

On 28 October 2019, LBC London News changed name to LBC News. While it remained on 1152AM in the London area for a further five years, it has been available since that date on DAB+ via the D1 multiplex nationwide using the space vacated by Radio X switching to DAB+. It has reverted to a 24-hour station dropping its simulcast of LBC but otherwise keeping the same format of 20 minute bulletins but with a UK wide focus.

LBC News announced it would stop broadcasting on medium wave from the end of October 2024 as part of Global’s strategy to switch off all AM transmitters across the UK as listening moves to digital platforms, marking the end of 49 years of broadcasting (a different frequency was used from 1973-75) on the former AM frequency of the first Independent Local Radio, LBC (London Broadcasting Company).

For the last twelve days of broadcasting on AM on air, a closedown announcement was played out on the frequency at the end of the advert break before the Top of the Hour news bulletin, warning listeners that they would no longer be able to listen to LBC News on AM in London and advising them to retune to digital platforms to continue listening.

Broadcasting of regular programmes on 1152 AM ceased on Wednesday 30 October 2024 at 10:00 a.m. and a closedown loop, being an edited version of the closedown announcement, was played out on the frequency, informing listeners that LBC News was no longer available on 1152 AM in London and redirecting them to digital platforms to continue listening. The AM transmitter then permanently ceased broadcasting and fell silent at 15:00 on Thursday, 31 October 2024.

==Programming==

From 28 October 2019, LBC News has broadcast 24 hours a day having previously simulcasted LBC during the evening and overnight – however programming is automated between 11pm and 6am.

90-second news bulletins are updated hourly through the night from &quot;Global&#x27;s Newsroom&quot; which provides news to all Global stations.

Following the decision by BBC Radio 5 Live to drop the reading of the classified football results from the start of the 2022-23 season, the station broadcasts the IRN network classified results read by Colin Besley live every Saturday afternoon at 17:10.

The station&#x27;s suppliers include Sky News Radio and INRIX Media.

==Listeners==
In Q3 2019, LBC London News had a record reach of 612,000 listeners every week, who listen for around 5.3 hours a week. Since Q1 2006, the station has shown consistent growth in terms of people listening, and roughly static total hours.

As of December 2023, LBC News and LBC London News broadcast to a combined weekly audience of 1.2 million, according to RAJAR.

<doc id="956191" wikidata="Q3521987" url="?curid=956191" title="The Nature of Things">
<text>The Nature of Things (formerly, The Nature of Things with David Suzuki) is a Canadian television series of documentary programs. It debuted on CBC Television on 6 November 1960. Many of the programs document nature and the effect that humans have on it, although the program&#x27;s overall scope includes documentaries on any aspect of science. The program &quot;was one of the first mainstream programs to present scientific evidence on a number of environmental issues, including nuclear power and genetic engineering&quot;.

The series is named after an epic poem by Roman philosopher Lucretius: &quot;De rerum natura&quot;—&quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;.

==History==
The first host was Donald Ivey, with Patterson Hume co-hosting many episodes. Following Ivey&#x27;s departure, the second season continued with several guest hosts, including Lister Sinclair, Donald Crowdis, and John Livingston. Since 1979, it has been hosted and narrated by David Suzuki. Suzuki has announced his retirement from the series at the end of the 2022 season; the CBC has announced that he will be succeeded by co-hosts Sarika Cullis-Suzuki (David&#x27;s daughter) and Anthony Morgan.

The series has won many awards and Suzuki has won three Gemini Awards and one ACTRA Award as best host. Documentarian William Whitehead has also been a frequent writer for the series.

In 1979 the show was merged with David Suzuki&#x27;s &quot;Science Magazine&quot; series and expanded to an hour. Suzuki reluctantly left the radio show &quot;Quirks and Quarks&quot;. He enjoyed radio as a medium because it was less restricted compared to television, but saw benefits in switching to television. He stated that television had a greater impact as it reached more people, and this was important because he wanted to make science accessible to the general public. The goal of &quot;The Nature of Things with David Suzuki&quot; was to translate the confusing and complex scientific language into concepts that the general public could understand. This would give people the information that they need in order to make informed decisions about how science and technology should be managed.
There is one new episode every week which all contribute to a scientific understanding of how the world works. They are created not only for entertainment, but also to encourage and popularize education.

An episode in January 2018 was widely criticized by scientists and Native Americans for its uncritical presentation of the Solutrean hypothesis.

In 2023, Suzuki announced his retirement and was succeeded as host by his daughter, Sarika Cullis-Suzuki, and Anthony Morgan in 2024.

<text>Capital Manchester was a local radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Capital radio network. The station broadcast from their studios at Global&#x27;s Manchester HQ in the XYZ Building in Spinningfields, Manchester.

In April 2019, the station was merged with 2BR in Lancashire to form Capital Manchester and Lancashire.

==History==

The 102 MHz frequency in Manchester has a chequered background. Initially it was occupied by Sunset 102 which included regular shows from house music innovators 808 State and a Saturday evening rave show from Sammy B; both were cited by Dave Haslam in City Life to have been instrumental in reflecting and developing the early rave culture in the city. However, due to occasional threats of violence on air and other breaches of the licence the station was closed.

The licence was re-advertised and quickly won by Faze FM who launched Kiss 102 on 16 October 1994. The licence win was spearheaded by Eugene Perera&#x27;s Level Broadcast, aided by Mike Powell&#x27;s Infinity Radio consultancy, and included shareholders UKRD, Eastern Counties Newspaper Group and 3i. Gary Burton, who had presented at Radio Trent for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, was Kiss 102&#x27;s first breakfast presenter.

The station became a victim of its own success when just months after opening a second station, Kiss 105 in Yorkshire, the station&#x27;s board accepted a £17.6 million takeover bid from the Chrysalis Group in 1996 for a company that had cost just £600k to set up three years earlier.

Chrysalis rebranded the station as Galaxy 102 in 1997. Eleven days after the transfer of ownership, as a direct result of EMAP, the Kiss brand owners refused to franchise the Kiss name to Chrysalis. The music policy was toned down, integrating R&#x27;n&#x27;B into the playlist and dispensing with many of the specialist programmes and presenters. Nevertheless, their investment in advertising and change of music policy was able to grow the audience further.

The station was rebranded as Capital on 3 January 2011 as part of a merger of Global Radio&#x27;s Galaxy and Hit Music networks to form the nine-station Capital network.

On 1 June 2017, local programming moved from Salford to new studios at the XYZ Building in the Spinningfields district of Manchester City Centre. Capital Manchester shares facilities with sister station Heart North West and two Communicorp-owned stations, Smooth North West and Radio X 90s.

On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station would be merged with 2BR in East and Central Lancashire. As of April 2019, local output consists of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Capital Manchester&#x27;s local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with network programming from London.

==Technical==
The transmitter is on top of the City Tower in Piccadilly in Manchester, the same place as the transmitter for Radio X and Radio X 90s. All 3 services share the same broadcast antenna system which is located on the centre tower and is illuminated with red Aircraft warning lights at night.

<text>Westbound Records was a Detroit-based record label founded by Armen Boladian in 1968. It had a distribution deal with Janus Records from 1970 to 1975, but then it switched distribution to 20th Century Records during 1975 and 1976, but again switched distribution to Atlantic Records from 1976 to 1979.

The label&#x27;s most successful and influential act was Funkadelic, including the classic “Maggot Brain”. Its biggest hit was &quot;The Americans&quot; recorded by local news reporter Byron MacGregor in 1974. Westbound was also home to the Ohio Players before they went to Mercury Records and the label had a top 15 hit with &quot;Funky Worm.&quot; Former Ric-Tic and Motown group The Fantastic Four also found moderate success during the disco era under the label. The Detroit Emeralds, who had also recorded briefly for Ric-Tic in the late 1960s, signed with Westbound in 1970 and enjoyed a string of hit singles, most notably 1972&#x27;s &quot;Feel The Need In Me&quot;. The record company&#x27;s last national hit was 1983&#x27;s &quot;You Brought the Sunshine&quot; by The Clark Sisters.

The label is still owned by Boladian and with its office in the Detroit suburb of Southfield on West Ten Mile Road. 

Westbound also had a sister label called Eastbound Records.

<text>Capital Birmingham was a local radio station owned and operated by Global as part of the Capital radio network. It broadcasts to Birmingham from studios at Brindleyplace in Birmingham City Centre.

In April 2019, Capital Birmingham was merged with a sister station in the East Midlands to form Capital Midlands.

==History==
The station began broadcasting as Choice FM on 1 January 1995, after taking over the licence previously operated by Buzz FM. Four years later, Choice was renamed as Galaxy after it was bought out by Chrysalis. Galaxy was sold off to Global Radio in June 2007 in a £170 million deal which saw the group take over The Arrow, LBC and Heart.

The station was relaunched and re-branded as 102.2 Capital on 3 January 2011 as part of a merger of Global Radio&#x27;s Galaxy and Hit Music networks to form the nine-station Capital radio network. In April 2013, the station along with Heart West Midlands moved to new studios at Eleven Brindleyplace in central Birmingham.

===Station merger===
On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed the station would be merged with Capital East Midlands. As of Monday 8 April 2019, the regional output consists of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Local breakfast and weekend shows were replaced with networked programming from London.

==Format==
Unlike other stations on the Capital network, the 102.2 Capital licence was to cater primarily for Urban contemporary black music rather than a &#x27;contemporary/chart music-led service&#x27;. The radio station format stated that the service should provide &#x27;a rhythmic-based music and information stations primarily for listeners of African or afro-Caribbean origin, but with cross over appeal to young white fans of urban contemporary black music&#x27;.

On 1 July 2011, Global Radio requested to change the formats of Capital Birmingham and Capital Scotland which have obligations from previous owners - this is to enable all nine Capital stations to be inline. On 17 November 2011 it was announced Ofcom approved two format change requests.

In February 2014, the station resumed opting out of networked programming for two hours each week, broadcasting an overnight specialist show featuring Afro-Caribbean music.

Capital Birmingham&#x27;s transmitter is located at Metropolitan House on the A456. It is also available on DAB via the Birmingham, Coventry, and Wolverhampton, Shrewsbury and Telford multiplexes.

<text>Michigan Jackson Frog is an animated cartoon character from the Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; film series. Originally a one-shot character, his only appearance during the original run of the &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series was as the star of the &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; short film (December 31, 1955), written by Michael Maltese and directed by Chuck Jones. In this cartoon, partly inspired by a 1944 Cary Grant film entitled &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, Michigan is a male frog who wears a top hat; carries a cane; and sings pop music, ragtime, Tin Pan Alley hits, and other songs from the late 19th and early 20th centuries while dancing and performing acrobatics in the style of early 20th century vaudeville. Michigan is discovered inside a metal box sealed within the cornerstone of a recently demolished building by a hapless construction worker. He appears as an ordinary frog with a disinterested facial expression until he takes out his top hat and cane and happily demonstrates his talents. The man plans to profit off Michigan but catches on too late that the frog performs exclusively for whomever possesses his box, and changes back into an ordinary frog the second anyone else sees him, thus thwarting the man&#x27;s dreams of wealth.

He appeared in a later cartoon titled &quot;Another Froggy Evening&quot;, which was released on October 6, 1995, and was the former mascot of The WB from that year until July 22, 2005. On September 17, 2006, after &quot;The Night of Favorites and Farewells&quot;, he was shown as the final image of a white silhouette bowing down to viewers, bringing up The CW.

==History==
The character may be loosely based on Ol&#x27; Rip the Horned Toad.

The frog&#x27;s earliest name was &quot;Enrico&quot;, as given in &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot; (1960). The character&#x27;s later, enduring name comes from the song &quot;The Michigan Rag&quot; (an original song written by Jones, Maltese, and musical director Milt Franklyn), which he sings in the cartoon. In a clip from a DVD special, Jones stated that he had come up with the name &quot;Michigan Frog&quot; during the 1970s and was inspired to add the &quot;J.&quot; as a middle initial while being interviewed by the writer Jay Cocks.

The &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection&quot; DVD credits Frog&#x27;s original singing vocals to Bill Roberts, a nightclub entertainer in Los Angeles in the 1950s who had also done voice work for the 1948 MGM cartoon &quot;Little &#x27;Tinker&quot;. (Roberts went uncredited at the time, as were most voice actors at the Warner Bros. studio who were not Mel Blanc, since only Blanc had a clause in his contract ensuring he would get on-screen credit.) In &quot;Another Froggy Evening&quot;, his voice was provided by Jeff McCarthy. In the cartoon &quot;From Hare to Eternity&quot;, Yosemite Sam digs up a treasure chest filled with carrots on a desert island; he also digs up Michigan J. Frog in his box who begins singing. However, Sam immediately shuts the box and tosses it away yelling, &quot;Not in my picture!&quot; Then, pokes his head out saying, &quot;I hate frogs.&quot;

Michigan J. Frog made a cameo appearance in the &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; episode &quot;Misjudgment Day&quot;, voiced by Jeff Bergman. He appears at the end of the episode (including a futuristic version of the first three lines of &quot;Hello! Ma Baby&quot;, which can also be heard in the background as Michigan croaks) as the one who sent one of his futuristic robots to destroy Bugs Bunny, and he later appeared in the show&#x27;s second season intro.

A frog resembling Michigan appeared in the beginning of the 1988 Disney/Amblin film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; at Maroon Cartoon Studios. The character also appears on the cover illustration (drawn by Chuck Jones) of singer-songwriter Leon Redbone&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;On the Track&quot;.

Michigan makes his return in the &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; episode &quot;Warner Bros. 100th Anniversary&quot;, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. He serves as the main antagonist, destroying the Warner Bros. studio and eliminating the majority of the studio&#x27;s other characters as revenge for the Titans not inviting him to the studio&#x27;s 100th anniversary party.

===Years with The WB===
Michigan J. Frog, again voiced by McCarthy, was the official mascot of The WB from its inception in 1995 until 2005. The network&#x27;s first night of programming on January 11, 1995, began with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck wondering which one of them would pull the switch to launch The WB. The camera then panned over to Chuck Jones drawing Michigan on an easel; when Jones finished, Michigan leaped from the drawing to formally launch The WB and lands on Chuck&#x27;s shoulder who then says &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Frog?&quot;

Michigan also would usually appear before the opening of shows, informing the viewer of the TV rating. Before the beginning of &quot;Savannah&quot;, for example, the frog would sing a short monologue suggesting that &quot;there&#x27;s more comedy for the family Wednesday nights&quot; and that kids should go to bed, meaning that the show coming on would be for mature audiences only. In later shows like &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, the announcer would present a TV-PG disclaimer, though the frog still appeared as a neon sign.

On July 22, 2005, Michigan&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; was announced by WB Chairman Garth Ancier at a fall season preview with the terse statement &quot;The frog is dead and buried.&quot; The head of programming for The WB, David Janollari, stated that &quot;[Michigan] was a symbol that perpetuated the young teen feel of the network. That&#x27;s not the image we [now] want to put out to our audience.&quot;

While The WB&#x27;s move towards a more adult-oriented content was Warner&#x27;s stated reason for abandoning the character, a more common theory is Michigan&#x27;s character was abandoned due to his connection to historical minstrelsy, often featuring racist depictions of African-Americans through blackface. On February 5, 2003, two years before Michigan&#x27;s retirement, the &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; episode &quot;Zapped &amp; It&#x27;s a Wonderful Chest&quot; aired with a skit mocking the character&#x27;s connections to blackface.

Various humorous obituaries for the mascot were published with details on Michigan&#x27;s life and death. His dates were given as December 31, 1955 – July 22, 2005. Despite the announcement by Ancier, Michigan still appeared in several Kids&#x27; WB! promos and bumpers (for example, a cart version of himself), The WB&#x27;s metonym (&quot;The Frog&quot;) until 2006, and in some WB affiliate logos and in TV spots, such as KWBF in Little Rock, Arkansas (whose early slogan was &quot;The Frog&quot;; the &quot;F&quot; in KWBF is supposedly for &quot;frog&quot;), during 2006, and WBRL-CA in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Also, WMJF, which began as a small student-run television station at Towson University just outside Baltimore, Maryland, still uses the same call letters (WMJF – Michigan J. Frog) from when the station was a WB affiliate. A neon likeness of Michigan J. Frog also adorns the facade of former WB affiliate WBNX-TV&#x27;s studio complex in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio.

When The WB ceased broadcasting and signed off the air for the final time on September 17, 2006, a white silhouette of Michigan appeared at the end of a montage of stars that appeared on the network during its 11-year history. When the montage ended with &quot;Thank You&quot;, Michigan&#x27;s silhouette is shown removing his top hat and bowing to thank the audience for 11 years, bringing The WB to a close, and later bringing The CW the following day, September 18, 2006.

<text>Capital North East is a regional radio station owned and operated by Global as part of the Capital network. It broadcasts to North East England.

The station launched on 1 June 1999 as Galaxy 105–106, renamed in 2006 as Galaxy North East and rebranded on 3 January 2011 as Capital North East.

==History==

===Galaxy North East===
Originally called Galaxy 105–106, presenter Steve Furnell launched the station on 1 June 1999with &quot;What You Need&quot;, by Powerhouse, being the first record played.

The station was based in Wallsend, North Tyneside at the Silverlink Business Park, east of Newcastle City Centre.

The name was changed to Galaxy North East in 2006, in line with other Galaxy stations. This year also saw a change in demographic from 15–29 to 15–34 and a new strapline of &quot;Passion for Music, Passion for Life&quot;. Two years later, the slogan was changed to &quot;Love Music&quot;. In 2008, they also changed their output format to include a more mainstream playlist. During late 2010, the slogan changed to &quot;The North East&#x27;s No.1 Hit Music Station&quot;.

Networked programming was broadcast from Galaxy Yorkshire in Leeds.

===Capital North East===
The station was rebranded as 105–106 Capital FM on 3 January 2011, as part of a merger of Global&#x27;s Galaxy and Hit Music networks to form the nine-stations of Capital. Steve Furnell and Karen Wight remained on breakfast with Roger &#x27;Bodg&#x27; Howard on drive time.

Kim Miljus was appointed managing director of Capital North East, replacing Matt Bashford, she was the former station director of Metro Radio. Giles Eyre-Tanner became the station&#x27;s programme controller on 5 October 2011, replacing Stuart Barrie.

Long-serving &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot; presenters Steve Furnell and Karen Wight left Capital North East to join rival station Metro Radio and TFM, &quot;Capital Drivetime&quot; presenter Roger &quot;Bodg&quot; Howard, producer Matt Bailey and &quot;Take Me Out&quot; contestant JoJo Hatfield took over from the duo on 3 January 2012. 2010 Student Radio Awards winner Rob Howard joined the station and presented &quot;Capital Drivetime&quot; for three years. From 30 November 2015 &quot;Gogglebox&quot; star Scarlett Moffatt replaced Hatfield for a year. On 19 June 2017, former Miss Newcastle winner Hannah Gray took over from Moffatt.

In May 2015, Capital North East moved to new studios at Wellbar Central in Newcastle city centre, shared with sister station Heart North East and Communicorp-owned Smooth North East.

On 26 February 2019, Global stated the station&#x27;s local &quot;Capital Breakfast&quot; and weekend shows would be replaced with networked programming from 8 April 2019. The weekday local &quot;Capital Drivetime&quot; show was retained, alongside news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. &quot;Bodg&quot;, Matt Bailey and Hannah Gray left the station whilst Martin Lowes remains.

==Transmission==
Capital North East broadcasts on at a power of 10kW from the Burnhope Transmitter, on at a power of 0.5kW from the Fenham Transmitter for West Newcastle, at 0.1kW from the Newton Transmitter for the Hexham area and on at 8.9kW from the Bilsdale Transmitter for Teesside although coverage unintentionally extends much further.

==Programming==
All programming is broadcast and produced from Global&#x27;s London headquarters.

Global&#x27;s newsroom broadcasts hourly localised news updates from 6am-6pm on weekdays and 8am-12pm at weekends.

<text>Irving Martin Abella (July 2, 1940 – July 3, 2022) was a Canadian historian who served as a professor at York University from 1968 to 2013. He specialized in the history of the Jews in Canada and the Canadian labour movement.

==Early life==
Abella was born in Toronto on July 2, 1940. His parents were Esther (Shiff) and Louis Abella. He studied at the University of Toronto, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in 1963 and a Master of Arts the following year. He commenced his doctoral studies at the University of California, Berkeley, before returning to the University of Toronto and being awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in 1969. He wrote his thesis on Canadian labour history.

==Career==
Abella first taught at York University in 1968, specializing in labour and Jewish history. He continued teaching at that institution until 2013. During the early 1970s, he started the first university course in Canadian Jewish studies at Glendon College, which he considered his greatest achievement. He served as president of the Canadian Jewish Congress from 1992 to 1995. He was also chair of Vision TV, a religious broadcaster. He was president of the Canadian Historical Association for the year 1999-2000.

Abella&#x27;s books include &quot;Coat of Many Colours: Two Centuries of Jewish Life in Canada&quot; (1990) and &quot;None Is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933–1948&quot; (1982). He stated that the latter – which detailed the Canadian government&#x27;s immigration policy during the 1930s that led it to accept only 5,000 Jewish refugees during World War II – was not intended to be more than an academic text. However, it ultimately impacted the immigration policy of the government at the time. After Ron Atkey, the minister of immigration, read a draft copy of the manuscript, the Canadian government welcomed 50,000 Vietnamese boat people by the end of 1980 (up from the original goal of 8,000 refugees per year).

==Personal life and death==
Abella married Rosalie Silberman Abella in 1968. They met while studying at the University of Toronto together, and remained married until his death. She was later appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada in August 2004. Together, they have two children, Jacob and Zachary.

Abella died on July 3, 2022, one day after his 82nd birthday. He suffered from an unspecified long illness prior to his death.

==Awards and honours==
Abella was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. He was conferred the National Jewish Book Award in 1983 under the Holocaust category for &quot;None Is Too Many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933–1948&quot;. He was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in October 1993 and invested four months later in February of the following year. He was the recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002) and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012). Abella later received the Order of Ontario in 2014 &quot;for his contribution to documenting the story of Jewish Canadians, and his commitment to the principles of social justice and tolerance.&quot;

<doc id="956216" wikidata="Q3129029" url="?curid=956216" title="Heart West Midlands">
<text>Heart West Midlands is a regional radio station owned and operated by Global as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts to the West Midlands.

==History==
Heart began broadcasting to the West Midlands on Tuesday 6 September 1994, as 100.7 Heart FM, becoming the UK&#x27;s third Independent Regional Radio station, five days after Century Radio in the North East and Jazz FM North West.

The first song to be played on 100.7 Heart FM was &quot;Something Got Me Started&quot; by Simply Red. Its original format of &quot;soft adult contemporary&quot; music included artists such as Lionel Richie and Tina Turner. Reflecting this, its early slogan described the station as being &quot;100.7 degrees cooler&quot;.

Its programming format was modified in 1996, a year after Chrysalis launched Heart 106.2 in London. The new format saw the &quot;soft&quot; AC music replaced with a generally more neutral Hot AC music playlist. This saw radio audience listening figures grow to equal that of local rival BRMB, which had been the leading commercial radio station in the West Midlands. New presenters were brought in from other stations; Daryl Denham arrived in 2000 from Hallam FM&#x27;s breakfast show in a high-profile move, while Ian Danter and Carlos also arrived from BRMB.

One of Heart&#x27;s most popular presenters, Tushar Makwana, was killed in 2004 following a burglary at his home which left him injured on his doorstep. The station&#x27;s staff paid tribute to the presenter on-air, and campaigned for the person(s) responsible to be brought to justice. The station&#x27;s reception area at the former Broad Street studios included a photographic tribute and plaque.

Following a corporate rebrand of the station, including a change of logo, the more contemporary look was soon reflected in the station&#x27;s sound. The format was later described as more Hot AC and featured more music from the likes of Natasha Bedingfield, James Blunt and Keane as well as soul music from the 1970s, branded as &quot;Club Classics&quot;. During this relaunch, long-time presenters departed the station, such as Carlos, and Nick Piercey, to be replaced by younger presenters.

2005 saw the evacuation of its studios after West Midlands Police alerted staff and other civilians following a bomb alert in Birmingham&#x27;s Broad Street complex. The station continued to operate, initially relaying sister station LBC News 1152 before transmission switched to the studios of Century 106 (now Hits Radio East Midlands) in Nottingham which broadcast reports from DNN journalists, who had to broadcast from a phone booth due to restrictions on the use of mobile phones.

On 11 September 2006, new station idents and jingles were used for the first time, and saw the station referred to purely as &#x27;Heart&#x27; rather than &#x27;100.7 Heart FM&#x27;.

On 25 June 2007, it was announced that Heart along with its sister stations The Arrow, LBC and Galaxy were to be sold for £170 million to Global from Chrysalis Radio.

On 28 April 2008, Heart West Midlands began simulcasting most of its programmes from Heart 106.2 in London. By 2010, local programming from Birmingham was reduced to seven hours on weekdays and four hours on Saturday and Sunday.

In February 2019, following OFCOM&#x27;s decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Global announced it would replace Heart West Midlands&#x27; local breakfast and weekend shows with networked programming from London.

From 3 June 2019, the station&#x27;s local output consisted of a three-hour Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising.

As of 24 February 2025 all programming originates from Global&#x27;s London headquarters, including &quot;Heart Drive&quot;, presented each weekday by JK and Kelly Brook.

==Station information==

The station was housed in 111 Broad Street - the same building as Global Radio-owned sister stations Capital Birmingham and The Arrow. The Digital News Network (DNN) also broadcast from the building until it ceased transmission in August 2006, to be replaced by LBC, whose regional DAB service was fully rolled out on 1 September.

In April 2013, Global moved its Birmingham operations from Broad Street to new studios at nearby Eleven Brindleyplace - Heart shares its facilities with sister stations Capital Midlands and Smooth West Midlands.

The FM signal - 11kW ERP - is broadcast from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter, and is audible throughout a large part of the Midlands, including the East Midlands towns of Leicester, Derby and parts of Nottingham. It can be heard with fairly decent audible quality in Kingswood, Bristol. This is because Kingswood is very high up meaning there is a clear line of sight between the north and Kingswood. The station is available on DAB, thanks to eight transmitters throughout the West Midlands on the MXR 12A multiplex, with strong signals from The Wrekin and Ilmington in south Warwickshire.

==News==
Journalists within the West Midlands produce hourly regional news bulletins from 6am to 7pm on weekdays and from 6am to 12pm at weekends.

==Notable former presenters==
Former presenters on the station include Ed James, Carlos, Daryl Denham, Nick Piercey, Ted Elliott (voice over), Sarah Jane Mee and Joel Ross.

<text>Heart London is a regional radio station owned and operated by Global Radio as part of the Heart network. It broadcasts a hot adult contemporary radio format. Across London and its neighbouring counties, it can be heard on 106.2 MHz.

==History==
In 1994 Chrysalis Radio was awarded a London-wide licence to broadcast &quot;soft AC&quot; music, winning the licence as &quot;Crystal FM&quot;.

The name was changed to Heart 106.2 which began test transmissions in August 1995, prior to the station launch on 5 September. This included live broadcasts of WPLJ from New York City.

In 1996 the Heart programming format saw the &quot;soft AC&quot; music replaced with a generally more neutral Hot AC playlist.

On 25 June 2007, Chrysalis Records announced that Heart along with its sister stations The Arrow, Sky News Radio, LBC and Galaxy were to be sold for £170 million to Global Radio.

On 28 April 2008, Heart London began simulcasting most of its programmes on Heart West Midlands, thereby beginning a roll-out of Heart London to other stations and by 2010, local programming was reduced to seven hours on weekdays and four hours on Saturday and Sunday. By 2019, that output was reduced to the OFCOM minimum 3 hours per weekday, with no local content on weekends.

==Availability==
In addition to FM, the station is available on DAB digital radio in London, and across the UK on Freesat, Sky, Freeview, TalkTalk TV and Virgin Media. The station is also available on MXR regional DAB multiplexes in the North West, North East, the Severn Estuary and Yorkshire, as well as on Switch Digital in central Scotland, having replaced Heart Digital. Until April 2006, the station could also be listened to worldwide through its Internet stream. However, according to the website, the station has withdrawn this facility outside the UK due to licensing laws.

<doc id="956226" wikidata="Q866857" url="?curid=956226" title="Bradford &amp; Bingley">
<text>Bradford &amp; Bingley plc was a British bank with headquarters in the West Yorkshire town of Bingley.

The bank was formed in December 2000 by demutualisation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society following a vote of the building society&#x27;s members, who swapped their nominal share of the building society for at least 250 shares of the newly formed bank.

In 2008, partly due to the credit crunch, the bank was nationalised and in effect split into two parts; the mortgage book and investment portfolios remained with the now publicly owned Bradford &amp; Bingley plc, and the deposits and branch network (and a licence to use the B&amp;B name for those aspects) was sold to Abbey National, itself owned by the Spanish Santander Group. The branch network was rebranded Santander on 11 January 2010 and the Bradford &amp; Bingley name mainly relates to the nationalised section of the bank. From 2010, the brand has been used under licence for insurance products by BGL Group.

== History ==

===Formation===
The Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society was the product of a merger between the Bradford Equitable Building Society (Bradford EBS) and the Bingley Building Society (Bingley BS) in 1964. There had been a move towards consolidation in the industry which had as many as 681 societies. In 1963 Bingley made the approach and the merger was effected with the understanding that there would be complete parity of control. Although Bingley BS had the larger number of branches (29 v 23) it was smaller by assets compared to the Bradford EBS (£43m v £56m). The Head Office was to be at Bingley; Bradford EBS had the President and Bingley BS the Vice President; and there were Joint Managing Directors. The new Society ranked number eight in the industry.

===Sustained Growth===
The period between the formation of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society and the conversion to a public company in 2000 saw sustained and substantial growth. Financial growth was aided by inflation, particularly in house prices, but the increase in members was from 164,000 in 1964 to 1.85m in 1988. 

As well as organic development through the opening of new branches there were 24 acquisitions of other building societies between 1967 and 1987. The Hearts of Oak Society in 1982 was of particular benefit as it brought in 28 branches, mainly in the south-east. By 1988 the number of branches had increased from the 52 post-merger to around 250. Despite all this, the Society was still only number eight in the industry – a reflection of the amalgamations that were taking place elsewhere.

In May 1997 the society bought &quot;Mortgage Express&quot; from Lloyds TSB for £64 million.

In December 2000, following a vote by members, the society demutualised and floated on the London Stock Exchange (using the symbol BB). Former members of the society each received a minimum of 250 shares worth £567.50 at the time, and savers with more savings receiving more shares worth up to £5,000 each.

===2007–2008 Financial Crisis===
B&amp;B had chosen to specialise in buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages – its strategy left it exposed to the sub-prime crisis.

In response to the 2007–2008 financial crisis in June 2008 the company launched a £400 million rights issue. This was not well subscribed by shareholders, leaving much of issue with underwriters. The issue had not been helped when TPG Capital, who had previously agreed to take a 23% stake in the company, withdrew their support.

Due to the effects of the credit crunch, in September 2008 the company&#x27;s share price dropped to a record low. On 25 September 2008 they announced that 370 jobs were to go. The bank had also been seeking options from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the government to secure the future of the company, including selling the company to another bank or nationalisation. With Bradford &amp; Bingley being nationalised, the structure was already in place from the legislation involved in the nationalisation of the Northern Rock bank in February (see Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 and Nationalisation of Northern Rock). The European regulators approved the government&#x27;s rescue plan for Bradford &amp; Bingley after just 24 hours.

===Part nationalisation and sale of the savings book &amp; branch network to Abbey National===
There were reports from various sources that Bradford &amp; Bingley was to be nationalised in its entirety, because a suitable buyer could not be found. With the structure already in place form the legislation involved in the nationalisation of the Northern Rock bank in February 2008 (see Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008 and Nationalisation of Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley was nationalised on 29 September 2008. European regulators approved the government&#x27;s rescue plan for Bradford &amp; Bingley after just 24 hours.

On 29 September 2008 it was also announced that the Spanish Santander Group under its Abbey National brand would acquire all of Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s £20 billion (2.7 million customers) savings business and branch network. Santander paid £612 million, including the transfer of £208 million of capital relating to offshore companies. Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s 197 retail branches, 141 agencies and related employees were transferred to Santander&#x27;s subsidiary Abbey. The mortgage book, personal loan book, headquarters, treasury assets and its wholesale liabilities were taken into public ownership and closed to new business.In November 2008, the government set up a new company, UK Financial Investments (UKFI), to manage the shareholdings in Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley.

===Bradford &amp; Bingley Shares===
When the shares closed on 26 September they were worth 20 pence each, valuing the bank at £256 million, substantially less than Santander paid for it. In March 2006 the bank had been valued at £3.2 billion. 

Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s shareholders were not reimbursed for their shares which the government had taken over. Over 300 shareholders complained to the UK Shareholders Association that they had not received information relating to the fate of their holdings. Peter Clokey of PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed by the government in June 2009 to act as independent valuer of the business, and it was reported that shareholders would be told how much compensation they were entitled to by June 2010.

Clokey&#x27;s assessment was published on 5 July 2010, finding that shareholders were not entitled to any compensation. The decision was appealed to the Upper Tribunal&#x27;s Tax and Chancery Chamber where on 19 July 2012, Judge Sir Stephen Oliver recorded that the court was satisfied that the valuer had carried out his duties wholly in accordance with the compensation scheme.

===Post Nationalisation===
In April 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Bradford &amp; Bingley may sell assets such as its commercial loan book, to assist in the running down its £42.2 billion loan book over the next ten years. In October, &quot;the Telegraph&quot; reported that the mortgage part of Bradford and Bingley would be mirroring the decision by Northern Rock to split their assets into good and bad assets, to attempt to pay off its £18.4 billion loan early.

On 11 January 2010, the combined business of Abbey and the Bradford &amp; Bingley branch network was renamed Santander UK, and all branches were rebranded at a cost of £12 million. Alliance &amp; Leicester was rebranded at the end of November 2010.

On 25 January 2010, the European Commission approved the state aid given to the bank. On 24 March 2010 UKFI announced the merger of the mortgage business with the bad bank of Northern Rock, Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc. The two businesses were merged under a single holding company, UK Asset Resolution, on 1 October 2010.

===Asset Sales===
Under UKAR&#x27;s ownership, a number of asset sales were undertaken, with the proceeds use to repay the government loan.

===Transfer of ownership to Davidson Kempner and Hyalite Mortgages===
On 29 October 2021, ownership of Bradford and Bingley was transferred from UK Asset Resolution to Davidson Kempner Capital Management, returning the company to private ownership. The government loan was repaid at this point, which ended the government&#x27;s financial interest in Bradford &amp; Bingley.

On 23 October 2023, Bradford and Bingley, and Mortgage Express ceased to operate with all remaining accounts transferred to Hyalite Mortgages, a division of Topaz Finance Limited.

== Operations ==
The group ran two distinct businesses: retail and lending.

=== Retail ===
Bradford &amp; Bingley distributed brand-name and third party financial products. As at 31 December 2007 they had 197 branches and 140 third party agent locations offering retail products and face to face advice in addition to online and intermediary distribution.

Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s approach to mortgage advising was innovative as they advised on and sold other providers mortgages as well as their own from 2000 to 2006. In late 2006, as part of their aim to become the UK&#x27;s leading specialist lender, Bradford &amp; Bingley reverted to selling only their own mortgages under the Bradford &amp; Bingley and Mortgage Express brands. In addition, Bradford &amp; Bingley acquired mortgages from GMAC-RFC and Kensington Mortgage Group Ltd; this accounted for 44% of gross residential advances during 2007.

As mentioned above, the savings business and branch network was transferred to Abbey National, part of the Santander Group, where it was subsequently rebranded under the Santander name. Bradford &amp; Bingley International was an offshore subsidiary of Bradford &amp; Bingley based on the Isle of Man, and this was also transferred to Santander through Abbey National.

=== Lending ===
Bradford &amp; Bingley had its own lending products including mortgage and commercial real estate products. Bradford &amp; Bingley also provided loan quotes through &quot;Compare the Loan&quot; for those who did not have a Bradford &amp; Bingley branch locally. Since the takeover by HM Treasury of the lending operations, Bradford &amp; Bingley no longer offered new mortgages or other lending products.

Bradford &amp; Bingley had developed Mortgage Express into a &#x27;niche&#x27; lending brand dealing with specialist lending with more complicated underwriting requirements such as buy-to-let and self-certification mortgages. Mortgage Express is also closed to new business, following Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s nationalisation.

==Corporate affairs==
===Headquarters===

Bradford &amp; Bingley&#x27;s former headquarters were on Main Street in Bingley. A new office in Crossflatts in Bingley was built in 2004, which became the new company headquarters. Following Santander&#x27;s purchase of the savings business, it was confirmed in May 2009 that remaining Bradford &amp; Bingley staff would transfer to the company&#x27;s head office in Crossflatts, and that the Bingley building would be sold or sub-let.

Sainsbury&#x27;s bought the building in 2010 and unveiled plans to redevelop it as a supermarket. Planning permission for a new supermarket was granted in September 2011, but in April 2012, Sainsbury&#x27;s admitted that building work would not begin for another 12 months. In November 2013 the company revealed it would not go ahead with a new supermarket, but would instead demolish the building and sell the site. Demolition work was delayed by the discovery of roosting bats and asbestos, but began in January 2015. On 12 January 2017, it was confirmed that Sainsbury&#x27;s had sold the site to rival supermarket company Lidl.

=== Trademarks ===
During the nationalisation process, it was revealed that the bank had registered more than 100 separate trademarks featuring the bowler hat, its long-running logo. The bank had also purchased a bowler hat in 1995 which had formerly belonged to Stan Laurel, for £2,000.

Ownership of the trademarks transferred to Santander with the licence to use the Bradford &amp; Bingley name as part of the sale.

== Sponsorship ==
Bradford &amp; Bingley were previously sponsors of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Bradford &amp; Bingley RFC (formerly Bingley Bees), and team sponsor of Bradford City A.F.C. Valley Parade stadium had previously been known as Bradford &amp; Bingley Stadium through sponsorship rights.

<doc id="956229" wikidata="Q1241154" url="?curid=956229" title="Botley, Hampshire">
<text>Botley is a historic village in Hampshire, England, approximately east of Southampton. It was developed as a natural crossing point for the River Hamble, and received its first market charter from Henry III in 1267. The village grew on the success of its mills, its coaching inns, and more recently strawberries, and was described as &quot;the most delightful village in the world&quot; by 18th century journalist and radical politician William Cobbett. 

==History==
When the Romans built a road from Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester) to Clausentum (Southampton), it crossed the River Hamble at a natural crossing point located to the south of present-day Botley. The crossing later became the site of Botley&#x27;s first settlement, which existed at least as far back as the 10th century. Known in Saxon times as &quot;Bottaleah&quot; (&quot;Botta&quot; was probably a person, while &quot;Leah&quot; was the Saxon word for a woodland clearing). Some time prior to the Norman conquest, a gradual rise in sea level meant that travellers found the river easier to ford further north of the original Roman crossing, this new crossing place provided a new focal point for the village, which in 1086 was listed in the Domesday book as &quot;Botelie&quot; and included two water-powered mills and had a population of less than 100.

At that time, the mills were owned by the family of Ralph de Mortimer, a French nobleman who fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066, and remained in the family&#x27;s possession until 1304 when the manor, including the mills, passed to the order of St Elizabeth of Hungary in Winchester. During the dissolution of the monasteries (1536-1539), the manor and mills were given to Thomas Wriothesly, a commissioner of Henry VIII and later Earl of Southampton. After the third Earl died without a male heir, the manor and mills passed to the Dukes of Portland. From 1838 to 1921, the site was owned by W and J Clarke. As well as grinding and trading cereals, the company traded in coal and, for a short time, manufactured paper. The Botley Flour Milling Company was formed in 1921, and in 1928 it was sold to the current owners, the Appleby family. 

In 1267 John of Botley, Lord of the Manor, obtained a royal charter from Henry III for holding an annual fair and weekly market in the town. The village did not, however, grow significantly and in 1665 the village still had a population of only 350.

During the 18th century, Botley functioned as a small inland port with barges transporting coal, grain, timber and flour along the river. The first bridge over the tidal part of the river was built in 1797 and by the time of the 1801 census 614 people were residing in the village.

During the early 19th century, the radical journalist and political reformer William Cobbett lived in Botley and called it &quot;the most delightful village in the world&quot;. From 1805, Cobbett lived initially at Botley House near Botley Mills, and then, from 1812, in a smaller house at Botley Hill.

A corn market was opened in 1829 and a cattle market in 1836, while Botley Market Hall – today a Grade II listed building – was built in 1848. A new church, All Saints, was built nearer the village centre in 1836. The National School opened in 1855 and the Recreation Ground was purchased in 1888. In the mid-nineteenth century the climate made south Hampshire ideal for growing strawberries and Botley became the centre for a thriving trade in strawberries. In 1841 Botley railway station was opened by the London and Southampton Railway Company. It became a major loading point for the seasonal strawberry traffic, as Botley formed the start of what is now known as the Strawberry Trail.

==Places of worship==

Botley has had a place of worship since at least the 11th century.

 The early church, commonly called St Bartholomew&#x27;s, adjacent to the old village of Boteleigh, was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. This church, south of the current village, was largely destroyed after a large poplar tree fell onto the nave in the early 1830s. This reduced the original capacity of 500 to what had been the chancel. The existing structure is 13th-century with an older doorway retrieved from the ruins and reset in the west wall. The east window is Perpendicular Gothic in style and dates from the 15th century. The church was formally declared redundant in May 1982.

A &#x27;Dissenters Church&#x27; was built in Winchester Street in 1800, attracting a growing congregation.

=== All Saints ===

Following the partial destruction of St Bartholomew&#x27;s, a replacement church, dedicated to All Saints, was constructed between 1835 and 1836. The new church was closer to the centre of the village; parishioners were finding it increasingly troublesome to take the path across the fields to the old church. The yellow-brick Gothic Revival church, designed by James William Wild, was consecrated on 22 August 1836. The church&#x27;s font dates to around the 12th century; possibly from St Bartholomew&#x27;s, it was recovered from a field in 1740.

The church was expanded in 1859, and architect Thomas Graham Jackson designed further expansions in 1892 and 1895. A church room was built in 1967, and a two-storey extension was completed in 2008.

<doc id="956235" wikidata="Q272731" url="?curid=956235" title="Edith Abbott">
<text>Edith Abbott (September 26, 1876 – July 28, 1957) was an American economist, statistician, social worker, educator, and author. Abbott was born in Grand Island, Nebraska. Abbott was a pioneer in the profession of social work with an educational background in economics. She was a leading activist in social reform with the ideals that humanitarianism needed to be embedded in education. Abbott was also in charge of implementing social work studies to the graduate level. Though she was met with resistance on her work with social reform at the University of Chicago, she ultimately was successful and was elected as the school&#x27;s dean in 1924, making her one of the first female deans in the United States. Abbott was foremost an educator and saw her work as a combination of legal studies and humanitarian work which shows in her social security legislation. She is known as an economist who pursued implementing social work at the graduate level. Her younger sister was Grace Abbott.

The Edith Abbott Memorial Library, in Grand Island, Nebraska, is named after her.

== Early life ==
Edith was born on September 26, 1876, in Grand Island, Nebraska. Her father, Othman Ali Abbott, was a lawyer and Nebraska&#x27;s first Lieutenant Governor (1877–1879). Her mother, Elizabeth Maletta Griffin, was an abolitionist and suffrage leader. Both parents instilled values of women&#x27;s rights, equality, and social reform into Edith and her sister Grace, inspiring their future work. Grace Abbott had many accomplishments working as a social worker, child labor legislation reformer, and chief of the United States Children&#x27;s Bureau (1921–1934), also working with Edith on many different professional projects during their careers.

== Education ==
In 1893, Abbott graduated from Brownell Hall, a girls&#x27; boarding school in Omaha. However, her family could not afford to send her to college due to a drought which struck Nebraska and eventually led to an economic depression. Instead of going to college immediately, Abbott began to teach high school in Grand Island, Nebraska. Determined to receive a college education, Abbott took correspondence courses and night classes until she was able to afford to fully enroll. Abbott enrolled at the University of Nebraska, receiving her degree in 1901. She continued to teach for two more years and was eventually awarded a fellowship to the University of Chicago. While at the University of Chicago working on her doctorate, she met Professor Sophonisba Breckinridge. She earned her doctorate in political economy in 1905. Later, Abbott and Breckinridge would publish multiple studies while at the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy. In 1905, Abbott graduated, receiving her Ph.D. in economics.

In 1906, Abbott received a Carnegie Fellowship and continued her studies at University College London, and the London School of Economics. She learned from social reformers Sidney Webb and Beatrice Webb, who championed new approaches to dealing with poverty. The Webbs influenced the direction of Abbott&#x27;s career. The Webbs were in favour of repealing the British &quot;poor laws&quot;—which they viewed as demeaning to people in poverty—and they supported establishing programs to eliminate poverty. While studying in London, Abbott lived part of the time in a social reformers&#x27; settlement in a poverty-stricken area of the East End, where she gained experience in social work.

== Early career ==

Abbott returned to the United States in 1907 after her years studying in London, and took a job teaching economics at Wellesley College. Though her job at Wellesley was highly regarded for a woman with a Ph.D at the time, she desired to return to Chicago. She got her chance in 1908 when Sophonisba Breckinridge, then Director of Social Research at the independent Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy, offered her a job teaching statistics in the Department of Social Investigation.

Abbott moved into Jane Addams&#x27;s Hull House with her sister, Grace, when she moved back to Chicago. At that time, Hull House was renowned as a mecca for educated women, for its vibrant community of residing revolutionary thinkers. Grace and Edith Abbott became great additions to the reform-minded community as they contributed significantly through their commitment to social reform advocacy and scholarship of statistical research. 

The long-lasting professional partnership between Abbott and Breckinridge first started during their years together at the School of Civics and Philanthropy. They shared a common interest in detailed statistical investigations of contemporary social problems which they believed they could use to spark reform advocacy. As a result of her experience in statistical research, following a crime wave in Chicago in 1914 Abbott was commissioned to investigate statistics on crime and criminals in the city. This led to a ground-breaking report titled &quot;Statistics Relating to Crime in Chicago&quot;, published in 1915.

During the first 12 years of their collaboration at the Department of Social Investigation, Abbott and Breckinridge jointly produced &#x27;The Housing Problem in Chicago&#x27;, which consisted of ten articles in the American Journal of Sociology (1910–15) reporting the results of their major survey of tenement conditions in Chicago. (A follow-up study, The Tenements of Chicago, 1908–1935, was published in 1936); The Delinquent Child and the Home (1912), a study of Chicago&#x27;s juvenile court; and Truancy and Non-Attendance in the Chicago Schools (1917), an investigation which led them to support compulsory school attendance and child labour legislation. In 1927, in dedication to the &quot;scientific and professional interests of social work&quot;, Abbott and Breckinridge jointly established the distinguished academic journal, &quot;Social Service Review&quot;, published by the University of Chicago Press.

With the joint efforts of Abbott and Breckinridge, in 1920, the University of Chicago&#x27;s Board of Trustees voted to rename the School the University of Chicago Graduate School of Social Service Administration. It was the first graduate school of social work in the country affiliated with a major research university. Abbott was hired as an associate professor of social economy, and was named dean in 1924. She became the first US woman to become the dean of an American graduate school. Abbott, along with Breckinridge, transformed the field of social work by emphasizing the importance of formal education in social work and the need to include field experience as part of the training. They designed a curriculum that heavily emphasized social statistics as the historical, legal, economic and political root causes of social problems and public welfare efforts. In addition, they fought for the professional status of social work. In 1931, Abbott collected many of her papers, addresses and speeches on social service education and created a single volume entitled Social Welfare and Professional Education (1931, revised and enlarged in 1942).

Abbott focused her attention on her students to portray the basic principles that can be transmitted to students. She states these principles must derive from &quot;a critical examination of the methods used to produce certain results and a searching equally for the causes of apparent failure and apparent success.&quot; Abbott derived a curriculum for students that desired a career in social work.

== Later career ==
Abbott was a prominent immigration expert, working for reforms that would end exploitation of immigrants. She was appointed chair of the Committee on Crime and the Foreign Born of the Wickersham National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (1929–31).

Through her advocacy, Abbott wrote in scholarly articles, book reviews, and governmental reports in which she discussed issues such as women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights, crime, immigration, and public assistance. She also stressed the importance of a public welfare administration, the need for a more humane social welfare system, and the responsibility of the state in addressing social problems.

Many of the contributions during Abbott&#x27;s career were dedicated to addressing welfare reform and adopting more humane standards for welfare treatment. In 1926, Abbott helped establish the Cook County Bureau of Public Welfare. Abbott and Breckinridge founded the Social Service Review in 1927, which, still administered by the University of Chicago, &quot;is committed to examining social welfare policy and practice and evaluating its effects.&quot; Throughout the Great Depression, Edith Abbott worked alongside her sister to combat a wide array of social ills, from the mistreatment of immigrants to the abuses of child labor. In 1935, Abbott assisted in drafting the Social Security Act.

Edith Abbott also had a significant role in the public sphere. Abbott was known to be a confidante and special consultant to Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1950, Abbott was known to have been appointed to a single case on the California Supreme Court, making her the first woman to sit on the state&#x27;s supreme court.

The death of Edith&#x27;s sister, Grace, in 1939 caused Edith to become quarrelsome and lonely, and slowly she began to withdraw herself from public life. In 1941, she published her final book, Public Assistance, and in 1942 she officially retired as the Dean of the School of Social Service Administration. Edith Abbott spent her remaining years living with her family in their home in Grand Island, Nebraska, where she died of pneumonia in 1957. She left the bulk of her estate to the Grand Island Public Library. She also left a trust for a collection of nonfiction books in memory of her mother, Elizabeth Abbott. At the time of Edith Abbott&#x27;s death in 1957, Wayne McMillen of Social Service Review wrote, &quot;History will include her name among the handful of leaders who have made enduring contributions to the field of education. Social work has now taken its place as an established profession. She, more than any other one person, gave direction to the education required for that profession. Posterity will not forget achievements such as these.&quot;

The sisters are buried together in Grand Island Cemetery.

== Publications ==

=== &quot;Women in Industry&quot; (1910) ===
Inspired by her question of women&#x27;s &#x27;compensation history&#x27; in the workforce Abbott worked in collaboration with Breckinridge who did a large amount of work with legality and economic status of women to write Women in Industry. The book was a milestone in feminist economy writings. Ultimately Women and Industry looked at the wages and labor history from an economic standpoint while at the same time keeping the social causations at the center of her research.

=== &quot;The Delinquent Child and the Home&quot; (1912) ===
The Delinquent Child and the Home: A Study of The Delinquent Wards Of The Juvenile Court of Chicago was published in 1912. It is another collaborative study done by Abbott and her colleague Breckinridge. The study deals with the court in its relation to the families and homes from which the delinquent wards come. It is considered an important work to the field of juvenile delinquency, which itself defends the juvenile court forcefully.

=== &quot;The Real Jail Problem&quot; (1915) ===
Edith Abbott&#x27;s book, &quot;The Real Jail Problem&quot;, discusses the issues with Cook County&#x27;s jailing system, and the poor conditions of those who are incarcerated have to face. In her book Abbott discusses the problems of imprisonment, and how this leads to suffering and humiliation for those who have been jailed. The issues she pointed to were those who were imprisoned because they could not make bail, those who are determined guilty, and those who face long term imprisonment. This work helped analyze specific elements of the criminal justice system and defined the social problems associated with imprisonment.

=== &quot;Truancy and non-attendance in the Chicago Schools&quot; (1917) ===
&quot;Truancy and non-attendance in the Chicago school; a study of the social aspects of the compulsory education and child labor legislation of Illinois&quot; was published in 1917 by the University of Chicago Press. Abbott and her colleague Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge co-authored the study while researching at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy. Abbott and Breckinridge examined non-attendance during compulsory-attendance period, and lack of enforcement of child labor laws. The study was also a continuation of the work Abbott and Breckinridge earlier work examining wards of the Juvenile Court of Cook County.

<doc id="956236" wikidata="Q573943" url="?curid=956236" title="Measles virus">
<text>The measles virus (MV), with scientific name Morbillivirus hominis, is a single-stranded, negative-sense, enveloped, non-segmented RNA virus of the genus &quot;Morbillivirus&quot; within the family &quot;Paramyxoviridae&quot;. It is the cause of measles. Humans are the natural hosts of the virus; no animal reservoirs are known to exist.

== Disease ==

The virus causes measles, a highly contagious disease transmitted by respiratory aerosols that triggers a temporary but severe immunosuppression. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes and a generalized, maculopapular, erythematous rash and a pathognomonic Koplik spot seen on buccal mucosa opposite to lower 1st and 2nd molars. The virus is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions.

== Replication cycle ==

=== Entry ===
The measles virus has two envelope glycoproteins on the viral surface – hemagglutinin (H) and membrane fusion protein (F). These proteins are responsible for host cell binding and invasion. The H protein mediates receptor attachment and the F protein causes fusion of viral envelope and cellular membrane. Additionally, the F protein can cause infected cells to directly fuse with neighboring uninfected cells forming syncytia. Three receptors for the H protein have been identified to date: complement regulatory molecule CD46, the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAMF1) and the cell adhesion molecule Nectin-4. For wild type and vaccine strains, extracellular domains of CD150 (SLAM or SLAMF1) and/or of nectin-4 (also called Poliovirus-Receptor-Like 4 (PVRL4)) mainly work as cell entry receptors. A minor fraction of wild type virus strains and all modern vaccine strains derived from the Edmonston strain also use CD46.

=== Genome replication and viral assembly ===
Once the virus has entered a host cell, its strand of negative sense ssRNA is used as a template to create a positive sense copy using the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that&#x27;s included in the virion. Then this copy is used to create a new negative copy, and so on, to create many copies of the ssRNA. The positive sense ssRNA is then mass translated by host ribosomes, producing all viral proteins. The viruses are then assembled from their proteins and negative sense ssRNA, and the cell will lyse, discharging the new viral particles and restarting the cycle.

== Genome and virion structure ==
The RNA genome of the virus codes 6 main proteins Nucleoprotein (N), Phosphoprotein (P), Matrix protein (M), Fusion protein (F), Hemagglutinin (H), and Large Protein (L), which represents RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The viral genome also codes two non-structural proteins C and V. These non-structural proteins are innate immunity antagonists; they help the virus to escape host immune response. Inside the virion genomic RNA is forming complex with N, L and P proteins. N, P and M proteins regulate RNA synthesis by RdRp. The virus is enveloped by a lipid membrane and glycoproteins H and F are virion surface proteins that are associated with this lipid membrane.

== Evolution ==

The measles virus evolved from the now eradicated rinderpest virus which infected cattle. Sequence analysis has suggested that the two viruses most probably diverged in the 11th and 12th centuries, though the periods as early as the 5th century fall within the 95% confidence interval of these calculations.

Other analysis has suggested that the divergence may be even older because of the technique&#x27;s tendency to underestimate ages when strong purifying selection is in action. There is some linguistic evidence for an earlier origin within the seventh century. The current epidemic strain evolved at the beginning of the 20th century—most probably between 1908 and 1943.

== Genotypes ==
The measles virus genome is typically 15,894 nucleotides long and encodes eight proteins. The WHO currently recognises 8 clades of measles (A–H). Subtypes are designed with numerals—A1, D2 etc. Currently, 23 subtypes are recognised. The 450 nucleotides that code for the C‐terminal 150 amino acids of N are the minimum amount of sequence data required for genotyping a measles virus isolate. The genotyping scheme was introduced in 1998 and extended in 2002 and 2003.

Despite the variety of measles genotypes, there is only one measles serotype. Antibodies to measles bind to the hemagglutinin protein. Thus, antibodies against one genotype (such as the vaccine strain) protect against all other genotypes.

The major genotypes differ between countries and the status of measles circulation within that country or region. Endemic transmission of measles virus was interrupted in the United States and Australia by 2000 and the Americas by 2002.

== Infection ==
In the early stages of infection, the measles virus via CD150 (SLAMF1) receptor infects immune cells located in the host respiratory tract such as macrophages and dendritic cells. They transmit the virus to the lymphoid organs, from which it spreads systemically. In the later stages of infection, the virus infects other immune cell types, including B cells and T lymphocytes also via SLAMF1 receptor.  In addition, it infects epithelial cells located in the airways. These cells become infected via nectin-4 receptor and by cell to cell contacts with infected immune cells. The infection of epithelial cells allows the virus to be released via the airstream.

<text>Breiðdalsvík () is a fishing town in Iceland, located on a large cove of the same name.

It is part of the municipality of Fjarðabyggð in the Eastern Region, and is at the mouth of , the valley of the river Breiðdalsá. Route 95 branches off Route 1 near Breiðdalsvík and runs through the valley and over , a heath formed by an eroded volcano, to Egilsstaðir.

The primary industry is fishing. The settlement was established relatively recently. The former general store, the oldest building in the town, is now a geological centre with exhibits devoted to the volcanologist George Walker and to the linguist and literary historian Stefán Einarsson, who was born in Breiðdalur. The former fish factory has also been preserved. Breiðdalsvík has a hotel and a craft brewery. The Breiðdalsá is popular for salmon fishing.

On 10 September 1942, Breiðdalsvík was the location of one of the few World War II air raids in Iceland: a German warplane strafed a residential building called Hamar, hitting it with 9 bullets. The building was occupied, but there were no injuries.

<text>The Breeze Basingstoke &amp; North Hampshire was an Independent Local Radio station serving Basingstoke and the surrounding area of North Hampshire until it was purchased in 2019 by Bauer Radio and became part of Greatest Hits Radio South in 2020.

==History==
===Kestrel FM===
The Basingstoke station launched on 18 May 1998 as Kestrel FM. The previous owners Milestone launched a free weekly local newspaper, the Basingstoke Observer, in association with Kestrel FM in 2000.

In 2010, 107.6 Kestrel FM in Basingstoke was merged with Delta FM in Alton, Bordon, Haslemere and Petersfield. However, initially the old Delta FM frequencies had a separate Breakfast Show, hosted by Dave Trumper. Outside of weekday Breakfast the former Delta Radio frequencies shared with Kestrel FM 107.6.

By 2011, even this practice seemed to have been discontinued, with all areas receiving programming from Basingstoke.

==Celador takeover==
Up until 2012, Kestrel FM was run by the Tindle Radio Group. The station was latterly taken over by Celador and on 16 December 2012, rebranded as The Breeze.

The station continued to broadcast programming from its Basingstoke studios, from where regional programming for the Thames Valley and local news bulletins originated. The East Hampshire frequencies were moved to the Southampton-based Breeze station and 107.6 to the Thames Valley station.

==Closure==
The Breeze was purchased by Bauer Media in 2019 along with many other radio stations. On 27 May 2020 it was announced that The Breeze would become Greatest Hits Radio from early September 2020. The station went through a transitional period where its playlist was changed over to the 70s, 80s and 90s era and jingles changed to reflect the station playing &quot;greatest hits&quot;. The Breeze was finally rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio South at 6:00am on 1 September 2020.

<doc id="956258" wikidata="Q2997913" url="?curid=956258" title="Suanpan">
<text>The suanpan (), also spelled suan pan or souanpan) is an abacus of Chinese origin, earliest first known written documentation of the Chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century BCE during the Han dynasty, and later, described in a 190 CE book of the Eastern Han dynasty, namely &quot;Supplementary Notes on the Art of Figures&quot; written by Xu Yue. However, the exact design of this suanpan is not known.
Usually, a suanpan is about 20 cm (8 in) tall and it comes in various widths depending on the application. It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads on each rod in the bottom deck. The beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick jerk around the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.

Suanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root operations at high speed.

The modern suanpan has 4+1 beads, colored beads to indicate position and a clear-all button. When the clear-all button is pressed, two mechanical levers push the top row beads to the top position and the bottom row beads to the bottom position, thus clearing all numbers to zero. This replaces clearing the beads by hand, or quickly rotating the suanpan around its horizontal center line to clear the beads by centrifugal force.

== History ==

The word &quot;abacus&quot; was first mentioned by Xu Yue (160–220) in his book &quot;suanshu jiyi&quot; (算数记遗), or &quot;Notes on Traditions of Arithmetic Methods&quot;, in the Han dynasty. As it described, the original abacus had five beads (&quot;suan zhu)&quot; bunched by a stick in each column, separated by a transverse rod, and arrayed in a wooden rectangle box. One in the upper part represents five and each of four in the lower part represents one. People move the beads to do the calculation.

The long scroll &quot;Along the River During Qing Ming Festival&quot; painted by Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) during the Song dynasty (960–1279) might contain a suanpan beside an account book and doctor&#x27;s prescriptions on the counter of an apothecary. However, the identification of the object as an abacus is a matter of some debate.

Zhusuan was an abacus invented in China at the end of the 2nd century CE and reached its peak during the period from the 13th to the 16th century CE. In the 13th century, Guo Shoujing (郭守敬) used Zhusuan to calculate the length of each orbital year and found it to be 365.2425 days. In the 16th century, Zhu Zaiyu (朱載堉) calculated the musical Twelve-interval Equal Temperament using Zhusuan. And again in the 16th century, Wang Wensu (王文素) and Cheng Dawei (程大位) wrote respectively Principles of Algorithms and General Rules of Calculation, summarizing and refining the mathematical algorithms of Zhusuan, thus further boosting the popularity and promotion of Zhusuan. At the end of the 16th century, Zhusuan was introduced to neighboring countries and regions.

A 5+1 suanpan appeared in the Ming dynasty, an illustration in a 1573 book on suanpan showed a suanpan with one bead on top and five beads at the bottom.

The evident similarity of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests that one may have inspired the other, as there is strong evidence of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci could be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model and Chinese model (like most modern Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the old version of the Chinese suanpan has 5 plus 2, allowing less challenging arithmetic algorithms. Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably more reliable since the wires could be bent.

Another possible source of the suanpan is Chinese counting rods, which operated with a place value decimal system with empty spot as zero.

Although sinologist Nathan Sivin claimed that the abacus, with its limited flexibility, &quot;was useless for the most advanced algebra&quot;, and suggested that &quot;the convenience of the abacus&quot; may have paradoxically stymied mathematical innovation from the 14th to 17th centuries, Roger Hart counters that the abacus in fact facilitated new developments during that time, such as Zhu Zaiyu&#x27;s treatises on musical equal temperament, for which he used nine abacuses to calculate to twenty-five digits.

== Beads ==
There are two types of beads on the suanpan, those in the lower deck, below the separator beam, and those in the upper deck above it. The ones in the lower deck are sometimes called &quot;earth beads&quot; or &quot;water beads&quot;, and carry a value of 1 in their column. The ones in the upper deck are sometimes called &quot;heaven beads&quot; and carry a value of 5 in their column. The columns are much like the places in Indian numerals: one of the columns, usually the rightmost, represents the ones place; to the left of it are the tens, hundreds, thousands place, and so on, and if there are any columns to the right of it, they are the tenths place, hundredths place, and so on.

The suanpan is a 2:5 abacus: two heaven beads and five earth beads. If one compares the suanpan to the soroban which is a 1:4 abacus, one might think there are two &quot;extra&quot; beads in each column. In fact, to represent decimal numbers and add or subtract such numbers, one strictly needs only one upper bead and four lower beads on each column. Some &quot;old&quot; methods to multiply or divide decimal numbers use those extra beads like the &quot;Extra Bead technique&quot; or &quot;Suspended Bead technique&quot;.
The most mysterious and seemingly superfluous fifth lower bead, likely inherited from counting rods as suggested by the image above, was used to simplify and speed up addition and subtraction somewhat, as well as to decrease the chances of error. Its use was demonstrated, for example, in the first book devoted entirely to suanpan: &quot;Computational Methods with the Beads in a Tray&quot; (&quot;Pánzhū Suànfǎ&quot; 盤珠算法) by Xú Xīnlǔ 徐心魯 (1573, Late Ming dynasty). The following two animations show the details of this particular usage: 
The beads and rods are often lubricated to ensure quick, smooth motion.

== Calculating on a suanpan ==

At the end of a decimal calculation on a suanpan, it is never the case that all five beads in the lower deck are move. Compared with the Chinese abacus, Japanese Soroban can accommodate up to 9 in each digit rod and when it becomes 10, the digit rod changes that will visualise the Decimal system bead in the top deck takes their place. Similarly, if two beads in the top deck are pushed down, they are pushed back up, and one carry bead in the lower deck of the next column to the left is moved up. The result of the computation is read off from the beads clustered near the separator beam between the upper and lower deck. In the past, the chinese used the traditional system of measurements called the &quot;Shì yòng zhì&quot; (市用制) for its suanpan. 

In &quot;Shì yòng zhì&quot; (市用制), the unit of weight the &quot;jīn&quot; (斤), was defined as 16 &quot;liǎng&quot; (兩), which made it necessary to perform calculations in hexadecimal. The Suanpan can accommodate up to 15 in each digit rod and when it becomes 16, the digit rod changes that will visualise the Hexadecimal system.

That is the reason why the Japanese Soroban&#x27;s 4 earth beads(when value is 0) is one bead apart from the beam while the suanpan&#x27;s 5 earth beads(when value is 0) are 2 beads apart from its beam.

=== Division ===

There exist different methods to perform division on the suanpan. Some of them require the use of the so-called &quot;Chinese division table&quot;.
The two most extreme beads, the bottommost &quot;earth bead&quot; and the topmost &quot;heaven bead&quot;, are usually not used in addition and subtraction. They are essential (compulsory) in some of the multiplication methods (two of three methods require them) and division method (special division table, &quot;Qiuchu&quot; 九歸, one amongst three methods). When the intermediate result (in multiplication and division) is larger than 15 (fifteen), the second (extra) upper bead is moved halfway to represent ten (xuanchu, suspended). Thus the same rod can represent up to 20 (compulsory as intermediate steps in traditional suanpan multiplication and division).

The mnemonics/readings of the Chinese division method [Qiuchu] has its origin in the use of bamboo sticks [Chousuan], which is one of the reasons that many believe the evolution of suanpan is independent of the Roman abacus.

This Chinese division method (i.e. with &quot;division table&quot;) was not in use when the Japanese changed their abacus to one upper bead and four lower beads in about the 1920s.

== Decimal system ==

This 4+1 abacus works as a bi-quinary based number system (the 5+2 abacus is similar but not identical to bi-quinary) in which carries and shifting are similar to the decimal number system. Since each rod represents a digit in a decimal number, the computation capacity of the suanpan is only limited by the number of rods on the suanpan. When a mathematician runs out of rods, another suanpan can be added to the left of the first. In theory, the suanpan can be expanded indefinitely in this way.

The suanpan&#x27;s extra beads can be used for representing decimal numbers, adding or subtracting decimal numbers, caching carry operations, and base sixteen (hexadecimal) fractions. 

==Zhusuan==

Zhusuan (; literally: &quot;bead calculation&quot;) is the knowledge and practices of arithmetic calculation through the suanpan. In the year 2013, it has been inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Zhusuan is named after the Chinese name of abacus, which has been recognised as one of the Fifth Great Innovation in China While deciding on the inscription, the Intergovernmental Committee noted that &quot;Zhusuan is considered by Chinese people as a cultural symbol of their identity as well as a practical tool; transmitted from generation to generation, it is a calculating technique adapted to multiple aspects of daily life, serving multiform socio-cultural functions and offering the world an alternative knowledge system.&quot; The movement to get Chinese Zhusuan inscribed in the list was spearheaded by Chinese Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Association.

Zhusuan is an important part of the traditional Chinese culture. Zhusuan has a far-reaching effect on various fields of Chinese society, like Chinese folk custom, language, literature, sculpture, architecture, etc., creating a Zhusuan-related cultural phenomenon. For example, ‘Iron Abacus’ (鐵算盤) refers to someone good at calculating; ‘Plus three equals plus five and minus two’ (三下五除二; +3 = +5 − 2) means quick and decisive; ‘3 times 7 equals 21’ indicates quick and rash; and in some places of China, there is a custom of telling children&#x27;s fortune by placing various daily necessities before them on their first birthday and letting them choose one to predict their future lives. Among the items is an abacus, which symbolizes wisdom and wealth.

== Modern usage ==
Suanpan arithmetic was still being taught in school in Hong Kong as recently as the late 1960s, and in China into the 1990s. In some less-developed industry, the suanpan (abacus) is still in use as a primary counting device and back-up calculating method. However, when handheld calculators became readily available, school children&#x27;s willingness to learn the use of the suanpan decreased dramatically. In the early days of handheld calculators, news of suanpan operators beating electronic calculators in arithmetic competitions in both speed and accuracy often appeared in the media. Early electronic calculators could only handle 8 to 10 significant digits, whereas suanpans can be built to virtually limitless precision. But when the functionality of calculators improved beyond simple arithmetic operations, most people realized that the suanpan could never compute higher functions – such as those in trigonometry – faster than a calculator. As digitalised calculators seemed to be more efficient and user-friendly, their functional capacities attract more technological-related and large scale industries in application. Nowadays, even though calculators have become more affordable and convenient, suanpans are still commonly used in China. Many parents still tend to send their children to private tutors or school- and government-sponsored after school activities to learn bead arithmetic as a learning aid and a stepping stone to faster and more accurate mental arithmetic, or as a matter of cultural preservation. Speed competitions are still held.

Suanpans are still widely used elsewhere in China and Japan, as well as in a few places in Canada and the United States. With its historical value, it has symbolized the traditional cultural identity. It contributes to the advancement of calculating techniques and intellectual development, which closely relate to the cultural-related industry like architecture and folk customs. With their operational simplicity and traditional habit, Suanpans are still generally in use in small-scale shops.

In mainland China, formerly accountants and financial personnel had to pass certain graded examinations in bead arithmetic before they were qualified. Starting from about 2002 or 2004, this requirement has been entirely replaced by computer accounting.

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Berkshire &amp; North Hampshire (Newbury) (formerly &quot;Kick FM&quot; and &quot;Newbury Sound&quot;) is an Independent Local Radio station serving Newbury and West Berkshire. The station is owned &amp; operated by Bauer Radio and was previously part of The Breeze network of stations, and broadcast from studios at Eastgate House in Andover.

It now forms part of the Greatest Hits Radio network.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Kick FM&quot;, the station began broadcasting full-time on 29 May 2000, although several RSL broadcasts were run beforehand under the &#x27;Kick FM&#x27; brand. Another station, NBC FM, run by Bruno Brookes and Keith Chegwin, made a rival application to the Radio Authority to become a full-time station in West Berkshire.
The station has two transmitters serving the area – one on 105.6 MHz at Wash Common Water Tower above Newbury and a smaller fill-in unit on 107.4 MHz at the John o&#x27;Gaunt School in Hungerford.

Kick FM was bought by Tindle Radio in 2006, and sold again in August 2009 to Andover Sound. At 7am on Monday 5 October 2009, Kick FM was rebranded as Newbury Sound. In August 2011, both Andover and Newbury stations were sold to Celador Radio.

Newbury Sound was named the South Station of the Year at the 2011 Radio Academy Nations and Regions awards. A month later, programming ended from the station&#x27;s studios at Bone Lane in Newbury and moved to Andover. On 12 March 2012, Celador announced Newbury Sound and Andover Sound would be rebranded as &quot;The Breeze&quot;, falling in line with an existing network of stations serving South Hampshire and the West of England (Bristol, Somerset and West Wiltshire). Both stations rebranded at midnight on Monday 2 April 2012.

The Newbury, Andover &amp; Basingstoke stations now share the same presenters and programming with separate links, news bulletins, station identification and adverts for all three areas. Breakfast and weekday drivetime programming is presented from Basingstoke with networked output from Southampton broadcast during off-peak hours.

In 2020, this radio station became Greatest Hits Radio.

<text>Cable &amp; Wireless plc was a British telecommunications company. In the mid-1980s, it became the first company in the UK to offer an alternative telephone service to British Telecom (via subsidiary Mercury Communications). The company later offered cable TV to its customers, but it sold its cable assets to NTL in 2000. It remained a significant player in the UK telecoms market and in certain overseas markets, especially in the former British colonies of the Caribbean, where it was formerly the monopoly incumbent. It was also the main supplier of communication in the British South Atlantic, including Saint Helena and the Falkland Islands. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

The company split in March 2010, with its international division demerging to form Cable &amp; Wireless Communications, acquired by Liberty Global in 2015, and since spun-off in 2018 from Liberty Global to Liberty Latin America, while the remainder of the Cable &amp; Wireless business became Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide and was acquired by Vodafone in 2012.

==History==
===1860 to 1901===

Cable and Wireless traces its history back to a number of British telegraph companies founded in the 1860s, and cites Sir John Pender as the founder. In 1869, Pender founded the Falmouth, Malta, Gibraltar Telegraph Company and the British Indian Submarine Telegraph Company, which connected the Anglo-Mediterranean cable (linking Malta to Alexandria using a cable manufactured by one of Pender&#x27;s companies) to Britain and India, respectively. The London to Bombay telegraph line was completed in 1870, and in 1872 the three companies were merged with the Marseilles, Algiers and Malta Telegraph Company to form the Eastern Telegraph Company, with Pender as chairman.

The Eastern Telegraph Company expanded the cable length from 8,860 miles on its founding to 22,400 miles just 15 years later. The company steadily took over a number of companies founded to connect the West Indies and South America, among them the &quot;Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company&quot;, leading to a name change to &quot;The Eastern and Associated Telegraph Companies&quot; in 1902.

===1901 to 2001===

Throughout World War I, all cable services out of Britain were controlled by the government. The Eastern Telegraph group profited enormously from the diversion of business to India and East Asia, away from the German-owned overland routes and from the general use of telegrams in preference to letters, which were delayed by lack of civilian shipping. For the first time, cables became targets of warfare in themselves. Eastern Telegraph, the British Royal Navy, and the General Post Office collaborated on cutting all cable links between Germany and North America. The Germans temporarily disabled both the Pacific Cable and the cable across the Indian Ocean, by attacking island stations in each ocean. However, the most spectacular event of the first &quot;cable war&quot; came in 1917, when, following the United States&#x27; entry into the war, the German cable that had been cut three years before was lifted out of its position between New York and Emden, Germany, moved to a new position between Nova Scotia and Cornwall, and taken over by the British government as a prize of war, to be operated by the General Post Office. In 1920, the government decided to keep this cable, despite U.S. protests, and to purchase a second line, the two together being renamed Imperial Cable.

With increasing competition from companies using radio communications, such as Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company, it was decided in 1928 to merge the communications methods of the British Empire into one operating company, initially known as the &quot;Imperial and International Communications Ltd&quot;, and from 1934 as &quot;Cable and Wireless Limited&quot;. The firm formed subsidiary corporations in various countries, such as the Indian Radio and Cable Communications Company in 1932, designed to oversee India&#x27;s external communications with other countries.

World War II revived the &#x27;cable war&#x27; of 1914–1918. In 1939, German-owned cables across the Atlantic were cut once again, and, in 1940, Italian cables to South America and Spain were cut in retaliation for Italian action against two of the five British cables linking Gibraltar and Malta. Electra House, the company&#x27;s head office and central cable station, was damaged by German bombing in 1941. However, the company made a considerable contribution to the Allied war effort, supplying, for instance, the wireless equipment with which the North African campaign was conducted in 1942, and sending staff, in army uniforms marked with Telcon flashes, into several campaigns, starting in Italy in 1943.
Following the Labour Party&#x27;s victory in the 1945 general election, the government announced its intention to nationalise Cable and Wireless, which was carried out in 1947. While the company would remain in being as a government-owned company, continuing to own assets and operating telecommunication services outside the UK, all assets in the UK were integrated with those of the General Post Office, which operated the UK&#x27;s domestic telecommunications monopoly.

In 1979, the Conservative Party government led by Margaret Thatcher began privatising the nationalised industries, and Cable and Wireless was an early candidate because of its history as a private company. The plan to privatise was announced in 1980. The government sold the first half of its share in Cable &amp; Wireless in November 1981. In February 1982, the government granted a licence for a UK telecommunications network, Mercury Communications Ltd, as a rival to British Telecom. It was established as a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless.

Seeing an opportunity to enter the growing US telecom market afforded by new, optical fiber technology (The US Communications Act of 1934 prohibited ownership of radio facilities by foreign owned companies), Cable &amp; Wireless acquired 9xDS3s from MCI along the Amtrak right of way and began selling transmission services. Among its early customers was a company named TDX Systems. In 1986, the US long distance industry was deregulated, and many new companies launched into the equal access market. TDX Systems, based in Falls Church, Virginia, was one of these, with a footprint between Washington, DC and New York. TDX carried data (analog modem up to digital DS3), and built its own telephone switches at its engineering facility in Chantilly, VA. TDX voice switches, called &quot;SSTs&quot; (satellite switching terminal) were centrally controlled nationwide by Perkin-Elmer mainframes in Falls Church, and were some of the first long-distance switches to utilize least-cost routing, follow-on account codes and PINs.

In 1997, Mercury was merged with three cable operators in the UK (Vidéotron, Nynex, and Bell Cablemedia), and renamed Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. Later that year, Cable &amp; Wireless bought 49% of the Panamanian state-run INTEL (Instituto Nacional de TELecomunicaciones, National Telecommunications Institute) for US$652 million: it is now the largest communications carrier in that country. 

In 1998, MCI Communications and WorldCom merged to create MCI WorldCom, the company&#x27;s existing US subsidiary Cable and Wireless USA, Inc. purchased the MCI tier 1 backbone in the U.S.: prior to 1998, Cable &amp; Wireless USA had merely operated a long-distance telephone business and a small internet service. In 1999, Cable &amp; Wireless began building global IP and IP MPLS (multiprotocol label switching) networks with a strategy to sell global IP services to corporations. Cable &amp; Wireless purchased Japanese company IDC (International Digital Communications), naming it Cable &amp; Wireless IDC Inc. 

In July 1999, NTL purchased the consumer assets of Cable &amp; Wireless for nearly £8.2 billion, integrating the telephone, internet and television operations of Cable &amp; Wireless into its own ever-expanding operation. This in-part lead to an aggressive strategy where, during 1999 and 2000, Cable and Wireless purchased 12 ISPs and other companies across mainland Europe (Austria, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland) and Sweden and Ireland to create, with its UK business, Cable and Wireless Europe. In December 2000, Cable and Wireless purchased Hyperlink-Interactive.

===2001 to 2013===

In 2001, Cable and Wireless sold its 52.5 percent stake in Cable and Wireless Optus, which was the second-largest telecom company in Australia, to SingTel. The deal was said to be the second largest corporate deal in Australian history.

In November 2001, Cable and Wireless acquired the bankrupt co-location provider Exodus Communications for US$800 million, and Exodus&#x27; operations were then merged with the previously acquired Digital Island and renamed Cable and Wireless America. In May 2002, Cable and Wireless purchased Guernsey Telecoms from the States of Guernsey. Later in 2002, Cable &amp; Wireless announced its withdrawal from the US corporate market, with operations being sold to Primus Telecom. In March 2004, SAVVIS Communications Corporation purchased Cable and Wireless America for US$155 million via the Chapter 11 creditor protection process, assuming liabilities of around US$12.5 million and assets including the former MCI IP backbone AS3561. Cable &amp; Wireless acquired Energis for £674 million in August 2005, resulting in a reverse takeover in terms of senior management, with John Pluthero appointed from Energis to head the UK business and Francesco Caio departing by April 2006. Cable &amp; Wireless cancelled its American depositary receipts programme in December 2005, voluntarily delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.

In February 2007, Cable &amp; Wireless sold the Web Technology Group, which focused on internet systems for the UK government, and in March sold its cabling business &quot;Allnet&quot;. In October 2008, Cable &amp; Wireless completed the purchase of Thus plc, which was rebranded as &quot;Thus, a Cable &amp; Wireless business&quot;.

In November 2009, the Cable and Wireless plc board announced its intention to separate the Cable &amp; Wireless Communications Group and the Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide Group, reflecting its belief that the businesses had reached a position where they would deliver increased value to shareholders as separately listed companies. On 26 March 2010, Cable &amp; Wireless Communications demerged as the former CWI Group business (Cable &amp; Wireless International) from Cable and Wireless plc and was listed as a public company on the London Stock Exchange. Cable &amp; Wireless plc became Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide. On 23 April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable &amp; Wireless Worldwide for £1.04 billion. The purchase was completed on 30 July 2012, and Cable &amp; Wireless was fully integrated into Vodafone on 1 April 2013.

<text>Hits Radio Oxfordshire, formerly known most recently as Jack 2 Hits and Jack 3 Chill, is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting in Oxfordshire, England on FM and the Oxfordshire DAB multiplex, as part of the Hits Radio network. It is owned and operated by Bauer Media Audio UK.

The station broadcasts to Oxfordshire from studios outside its broadcast area, in Segensworth in Fareham. It shares a local three hour weekday programme presented by Jono Holmes with Hits Radio Dorset and the DAB only Hits Radio South Coast.

As Jack 2 Hits, it was available in Surrey and Hampshire on DAB and online until April 2020. It also broadcast on FM in Oxfordshire on 107.9FM until it was switched to Jack 3 Chill in 2020 which it remained until it was closed and replaced by Hits Radio.

Hits Radio Oxfordshire competes with Heart South, BBC Radio Oxford, First FM and sister station Greatest Hits Radio, as well as some online community radio and DAB stations in Oxfordshire.

Previously known under a variety of names and formats since its inception in 1997 (see history), most recently Jack 3 Chill, the station launched in its current incarnation on 29 October 2023.

Before moving to Eynsham, Oxfordshire in March 2019, the station was based at 270 Woodstock Road in north Oxford – formerly the site of Six TV – The Oxford Channel.

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 27,000, according to RAJAR. Jack 2 Hits DAB feed closed on 30 October 2023.

==History==
The origins of the station lie in a student radio station, Oxygen 107.9 which was trialled in November 1995 and launched at 1.07pm on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1997. It was acquired in late 2000 by Fusion Radio Holdings, which rebranded the station as Fusion 107.9. Fusion merged with the Milestone Group in 2003 and the station was relaunched again as Passion 107.9, but was sold to ARI Consultancy (previously known as Absolute Radio International) in 2006, leading to another rebrand as Oxford&#x27;s FM 107.9.

In February 2010, the station&#x27;s owners lodged a request with Ofcom to change the station&#x27;s format to one that would target listeners over 45 years old. The station argued the &quot;transient&quot; nature of students makes it commercially difficult to market a radio station to an audience that leaves the city each year. Several fans of late night &quot;specialist&quot; shows responded to Ofcom&#x27;s public consultation as well as local business owners. Ofcom considered this, but the Radio Licensing Committee rejected this proposal. The station responded by saying that changes it had made meant the format change had become less necessary.

On 18 August 2010, after a publicity stunt where it briefly branded as &quot;Glee FM&quot; (airing only music from the American musical comedy-drama series &quot;Glee&quot;)&quot;,&quot; the station relaunched as Glide FM. The new format would be positioned towards women.&quot;&quot;

The station relaunched again as Jack 2 on 20 August 2013.

As JACK 2 Hits, it was a music-heavy station with only limited speech, instead allowing listeners to control the music and submit recordings of themselves to be played (through WhatsApp or the Jack 2 Hits app). The station was aimed at a young adult-contemporary audience and plays seven hours per week of specialist music as required by Ofcom.

In July 2023 it was announced that JACK Media Oxfordshire licences serving Oxfordshire, including JACK 2 Hits, would be acquired by Bauer subject to regulatory approval. The owners of JACK Media Oxfordshire will retain the ownership of the UK rights to the JACK FM brand, with the Oxfordshire services to be rebranded following the acquisition as Greatest Hits Radio and Hits Radio.

JACK 2 Hits ceased transmission in the early hours of 30 October 2023. The final song played was “Rather Be” by Clean Bandit.

<text>107 JACK fm Berkshire was an Independent Local Radio station in the English town of Reading. The station was based at studios in the Madejski Stadium, home of Reading F.C. and London Irish. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located on the Tilehurst Water Tower.

In August 2017, it was rebranded as [[The Breeze (radio network)|The Breeze (Reading)]]. The DAB version of the station was then rebranded as SAM FM shortly afterwards.

==On air==
Like all other Jack FM stations in the United Kingdom, the radio station was mostly an automated service with Paul Darrow providing topical one-liners in between songs as the voice of Jack, plus there was a weekday breakfast show &quot;Jack&#x27;s Morning Glory&quot; with Robin Banks, and there&#x27;s also the &quot;Sunday Roast&quot; on Sunday lunchtime with Sir John Madejski who interviewed notable local people.

==History==
The consortium behind Reading 107 FM submitted its bid for a local commercial radio station in September 2001 and the licence was awarded by Ofcom in March 2002. Reading 107 first broadcast at 8am on 22 October 2002. The first presenter was launch programme controller Tim Grundy and the first song was &quot;Listen to the Music&quot; by The Doobie Brothers.

In August 2005, Guardian Media Group (GMG) increased its shareholding in Reading 107 FM from 37.8% to a controlling stake of 60.3% when Milestone Radio Group decided to sell; the remaining shareholding being owned by the Goodhead Group plc, a company controlled by Reading Football club chairman Sir John Madejski. In December 2005, Reading 107 FM changed control again, this time from GMG to Madejski Communications Limited. Reading 107 flipped format to 107 JACK FM Berkshire on 2 March 2014.

<text>107.1 Rugby FM was an Independent Local Radio station in Warwickshire. At the time of closure, it was owned and operated by Quidem and broadcast from studios at Honiley, Warwickshire.

==History==
Under the directorship of Martin Mumford, 107.1 Rugby FM launched on 31 August 2002—former Silk FM controller Trevor Thomas was the first voice on-air, also working as the station&#x27;s programme manager, before leaving to join Warwickshire neighbour The Bear 102.

The station, then owned by the Milestone Group, enjoyed considerable success, and was lauded at one point as the UK&#x27;s most successful local commercial radio station in terms of audience reach - once at 44% (RAJAR Q2 2005) - attributed to an emphasis on local presence, and presenters who were recruited on the basis of quality. They also enjoyed a substantially different music policy to that of its competitors. Following Mumford&#x27;s departure in 2005, Julian Hotchkiss became Managing Director of Rugby FM but left a year later following the CN Group&#x27;s acquisition of the station in early 2006. The group had been a minority shareholder until this point.

From 2002 until 2008, the station was based at studios on Spring Street in the heart of the town centre. The CN Group acquisition had a number of far-reaching consequences on the output, notably the loss of 20 hours a day of local programming, and the studios being moved out of Rugby town centre into a regional hub in Kenilworth.

Between 2007 and 2009, the CN Group divested of its Midlands radio stations. First to be sold was Oak 107 FM, which went to the Lincs FM Group, who merged it with their licence in nearby Hinckley. Touch FM Banbury was sold a year later to a private consortium, and was subsequently rebranded as Banbury Sound. The remaining Touch stations, with Rugby FM, were sold to Quidem Ltd in Summer 2009, with Banbury Sound picked back up in October 2010 and Oak FM picked up in 2012.

In September 2019, Quidem announced it had entered a brand licensing agreement with Global, citing financial losses. Two months later, following permission from Ofcom to change the station&#x27;s format, it was confirmed Rugby FM would merge with its sister Quidem-owned stations and launch as Capital Mid-Counties on 2 December 2019. Rugby FM ceased broadcasting at 7pm on Friday 29 November 2019.

<doc id="956271" wikidata="Q5048019" url="?curid=956271" title="Casanova's Chinese Restaurant">
<text>Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant is a novel by Anthony Powell (). It forms the fifth volume of the twelve-volume sequence &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, and was originally published in 1960 Many of the events of the novel were included in the television adaptation broadcast on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 in 1997, comprising part of the second of four episodes. There was also an earlier, more comprehensive, BBC Radio adaptation.

As with several of the earlier volumes, there is a time-overlap with previous books, the first part returning to the period before the death of Mr. Deacon. The ruined door of a fictional Soho pub, the Mortimer, provides the narrative frame of the volume. However, &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant&quot; concentrates on a new set of characters, principally the composer Hugh Moreland, (based on Powell&#x27;s close friend Constant Lambert), his fiancée Matilda, and the critic Maclintick and his wife, Audrey, whose unhappy marriage forms a key part of the narrative.

The interweaving of historical with fictional events is more notable here, and is used to illuminate the characters, as for example in Erridge&#x27;s ill-considered departure for the Spanish Civil War.

Much of the book&#x27;s reception was positive. &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant&quot; is dedicated to Harry &amp; Rosie-  Henry d&#x27;Avigdor-Goldsmid and Rosie, Lady d’Avigdor Goldsmid.

* Hurricane Jeanne (1998) – a Category 2 hurricane that brushed Cape Verde and travelled over the Azores as an extratropical cyclone.
* Hurricane Jeanne (2004) – a strong Category 3 hurricane that formed near the Lesser Antilles on September 14 and travelled across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola as a tropical storm, causing over 3,000 deaths in Haiti. Later crossed the Bahamas and made landfall near Stuart, Florida.

The name &quot;Jeanne&quot; was retired in the Atlantic after the 2004 season and was replaced by &quot;Julia&quot; for the 2010 season.

In the Western Pacific:

<text>Défi mini-putt (&quot;Mini-putt Challenge&quot;) was a weekly show in the early 1990s on the Quebec cable sports network, &quot;Réseau des sports&quot;. It was the first professional miniature golf tournament to be regularly broadcast in Quebec.

Each course had exactly the same design, with some natural tweak, and every hole was a par 2. The Mini-Putt franchise used a minimalist design, featuring only hills, bunkers, and a few obstacles. This contrasts with the exotic, windmill-laden layouts of most miniature golf courses in the eastern United States and Canada.

== Holes description ==

The 18 holes of the &quot;Mini&quot; course usually played by the contestants were:

#&quot;Le totem&quot;, with three twelve-inch-tall wooden totem poles
#&quot;La croix&quot;, a course in the shape of a cross
#&quot;La courbe&quot;, a slightly inclined curve
#&quot;La discothèque&quot;, a sideways T-shaped course
#&quot;Le billard&quot;, a long rectangular course played by banking as in billiards
#&quot;Le hockey&quot;, an elongated L-shaped course 
#&quot;La rivière&quot;, a ramp to jump over a river
#&quot;Le putter&quot;, a U-shaped course
#&quot;Le chameau&quot;, with two steep hills
#&quot;Les trappes&quot;, a ramp bordered by two traps
#&quot;Le carrefour&quot;, a Y-shaped course
#&quot;Le slalom&quot;, with two off-centered gentle hills
#&quot;Les laurentides&quot;, with three steep hills
#&quot;Le zig-zag&quot;, a stretched Z-shape course
#&quot;Le monstre&quot;, an irregular incline
#&quot;La culotte&quot;, similar to &quot;Le putter&quot;
#&quot;L&#x27;équerre&quot;, a curved metal bracket leading to the hole
#&quot;Le plateau&quot;, a steep 2 feet high incline

In the 1990s, the Maxi course was also played occasionally on the show. Its 18 holes were:
#&quot;Les cailloux&quot;, with two traps avoided by hitting a metal bar
#&quot;L&#x27;escalier&quot;, a concrete staircase leading to the hole
#&quot;La tablette&quot;, a square flat-topped step
#&quot;Le recoin&quot;, a course similar to &quot;La courbe&quot; on the Mini course but including a trap
#&quot;Les montagnes russes&quot;, a long course made of gentle hills
#&quot;La cachette&quot;, a course where the hole is hidden in front of the player
#&quot;La coulée&quot;, a U-shaped concrete ramp leading to the hole
#&quot;Le triangle&quot;, a course where a metal triangle is hit to reach the hole
#&quot;Le nez&quot;, resembling a nose seen sideways
#&quot;L&#x27;Achaland&quot;, two gentle curves bordering traps
#&quot;Les sentinelles&quot;, where the hole is guarded by two upright metal pipes
#&quot;La soucoupe&quot;, with a circular depression leading to the hole
#&quot;Le facile&quot;, with gentle hills leading to the hole
#&quot;La fourche&quot;, a Y-shaped course with a concrete step
#&quot;Le super monstre&quot;, an irregular incline with a trap
#&quot;Les collines&quot;, where the hole is guarded by three small hills
#&quot;La porte&quot;, where the hole is reached by hitting an angular bracket
#&quot;La pente douce&quot;, a shallow 2 feet high incline with a metal obstacle

A third course, the Midi, was designed but never constructed.

== History ==

=== Golden age (1970–1988) ===
The show appeared on TVSQ and was called L&#x27;Heure du Mini-Putt (Mini-Putt Hour). In 1989, Réseau des sports was born and the show was renewed up to 1998.

During this period, Mini-putt celebrities were very popular. Some of the stars of the show were Jocelyn Noël, who had great consistency in the regular season but sometimes struggled in the knockout tournaments (most notably in 1992 when he struck a totem pole on the first hole, aka &quot;les totems&quot; and was eliminated), as well as the legendary Carl Carmoni, seigneur des birdies et champion mondial du Québec best known for his mastery of the green and his Pepsi addiction, Sylvain Cazes and Gilles Buissières &amp; wife Lucie, also Ron Poliseno, &quot;Le Grand Requin Blanc&quot;. Another famous &quot;double&quot; couple was Suzanne and husband André Buist. Later seasons of the show featured teams of two, as well as an upgrade to the Mini-Putt franchise&#x27;s more difficult course, the &quot;Maxi-Putt&quot;.

The biggest star of the show, however, was the very enthusiastic show announcer Serge Vleminckx. His exuberant shouts of &quot;Birdie!&quot; for a hole in one, &quot;la normale!&quot; for two strokes, and &quot;le bogey!&quot; for three strokes, helped attract a cult following for the show.

=== Decline (2002) ===

However, by the end of the 1990s, the Mini-Putt chain began to falter, and the owners refused to continue and pay for the show. In a meeting of the franchisers, when they decided to stop the TV show, Marcel Rocheleau, the owner of Mini-Putt Louiseville, said, &quot;This will be the end and we will pick-up the bones.&quot; Ron Poliseno, owner of Mini-Putt St-Eustache and Fabreville, along with 10 other owners, took a gamble and went back on TV for another two years. At that time there was still 51 franchises, but as of 2001, they found out that the TV was the reason of success. Then they started to fold up one by one. Today, three original Mini-Putt are still operating, but they all have to rely on a second product - ice cream, fast food, or a driving range.

Decline (2002- 2005)

Jocelyn Noel went on to participate in American miniature golf tournaments (PPA of Putt-Putt Golf), as well as Martin Ayotte, 4 times appearances. Serge Vleminckx went on to announce games for the short-lived Montreal Roadrunners roller hockey team. A lot of ancient players started to organize Mini-putt tournament during the summer where courses still exist.

=== Renaissance (2005–2020) ===

Since 2005, a lot of new talents have emerged from the underground scene, which led to new tournaments organised by past champion Carl Carmoni and fellow enthusiasts, and the creation of the Mini-putt league of Sorel-Tracy. These efforts culminated in 2012 with the presentation of the Coupe Mini-Putt 2012, a webserie of 4 episodes that followed the former Défi Mini-Putt&#x27;s format. Serge Vleminckx reprised his role and was assisted by Carl Carmoni and Jocelyn Noël as analysts. In May 2020, RDS broadcast this webserie resulting in great ratings.

Mini-Putt L&#x27;Authentique

The competition and tournaments are still alive, managed by Carl Carmoni and his group. Ron Poliseno owner of the Trade Marks Mini-Putt L&#x27;Authentique and Mini-Putt, has been approached by TV networks, to bring back the TV show and promote the series but the financing is still and always the problem.

=== Return to RDS (since 2021) ===

With a lot of hard work from Carl Carmoni and his wife Suzanne, a new 10-episode TV series will be broadcast on RDS after the 2021 Olympics. This invitational type competition takes place at Mini-Putt Shawinigan-Sud on July 3 and 4, 2021.

== Appellation ==

Linguistically, the show prompted &quot;mini-putt&quot; to become the favoured &quot;Québécois&quot; term for miniature golf, while in the rest of Canada and the United States, the terms &quot;miniature golf&quot;, &quot;mini-golf&quot;, &quot;crazy golf&quot;, and occasionally &quot;putt-putt&quot; are used interchangeably.

<text>Alpha Radio was a community radio station based in Darlington, England, for south County Durham. The brand has been bought and used multiple times, the current third iteration was formerly known as Darlo Radio. The original version was merged into Star Radio, the second into Sun FM.

==History==

When launched in 1995 as A1FM, Alpha was owned by Radio Investments Ltd while First Radio Sales

In 2009, Alpha was joined by neighbouring station Minster Northallerton to share the studio complex in a cost-cutting exercise. To make further savings, both Alpha and Minster Northallerton, along with Durham FM were rebranded as Star Radio North East which meant all three stations lost their heritage names and only produced a daily breakfast show. Since June 2010, output has been networked across all frequencies, although commercial breaks were still unique to the three areas.

===Imaging===

In its history, Alpha 103.2/ Alpha FM/ Alpha Radio had many jingle packages and imaging updates. In 2002, The Local Radio Group introduced Bespoke Music Jingles to its group of stations. This then launched an iconic sung logo for Alpha 103.2. Alpha had four main jingle packages from Bespoke. They were introduced in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2009. During 2003/ 2006, Alpha lost its jingles in favour of imaging when the Music:Fun:Life streamline was introduced. The main station Voice overs for Alpha throughout its life were, Emma Clarke, Chris Marsden, Jeff Davies and Greg Marsden.

The last ever Alpha Jingles were by sung radio jingles made by Bespoke Music. but had the name tweaked when the station changed names from Alpha 103.2 to Alpha Radio.Most recently the station had sung radio jingles made by Bespoke Music. The main station imaging for Alpha was designed and produced in house via the TLRC from Minster FM in York which was made as a generic package for the TLRC group and sent to all local station within the portfolio to be edited into &#x27;local ID&#x27;s&#x27; however later, the imaging was produced in Darlington&#x27;s Woodland Road studio&#x27;s via various producers such as Chris Hakin, Craig Bailey, Dan Callum and Dave Lee.

<doc id="956302" wikidata="Q4796121" url="?curid=956302" title="More Radio Hastings">
<text>More Radio Hastings, formerly Arrow FM, is an Independent Local Radio station serving Hastings, Bexhill, Battle and surrounding areas. It is owned and operated by Total Sense Media and broadcasts from studios in Worthing, as part of a network of stations across Sussex in South East England.

==History==

Arrow FM was founded in 1992 by two local radio executives, Mark Briggs and Matthew Wheeler, who conducted a series of RSL pilot broadcasts in both Hastings and Eastbourne. Three of the transmissions took place in Hastings under the &quot;Arrow FM&quot; and &quot;Splash FM&quot; branding - the licence holder was local DJ Terry James and the station manager was Terry Kane.

The group disbanded a year before the Radio Authority advertised a licence for one or more services in East Sussex. The winning bid, Conqueror Broadcasting Ltd - a consortium of local investors and radio operators, led by businessman Bill Uttley Moore CBE, who created the Arrow fm brand - won the licence in 1997. Mark Briggs rejoined the station ahead of its full-time launch on Good Friday 10 April 1998.

By 2000, Arrow FM had been sold to Radio Investments Ltd, which also had interests in nearby stations. This group went on to become The Local Radio Company, which then sold Arrow FM along with sister station Sovereign FM to Media Sound Holdings in 2009. Bespoke local programming for the area was reduced to the weekday breakfast show, with all other output shared with sister stations Bright FM, Sovereign FM and Splash FM.

In November 2010, Ofcom approved a request to share programming across all four stations, stating the changes &quot;would not substantially alter the character of the service.&quot;

==Programming==
All programming on the station is produced from Total Sense&#x27;s Worthing studios and shared with More Radio Mid-Sussex, More Radio Eastbourne and More Radio Worthing with opt-outs for local news and advertising. Local news airs every hour from 6am to 6pm on weekdays and from 8am to 12pm on Saturdays with headlines on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows. National news bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried hourly at all other times.

==Notable past presenters==

Arrow FM&#x27;s presenters during its early years of broadcasting included Peter Quinn.

<doc id="956306" wikidata="Q5060244" url="?curid=956306" title="Central 103.1 FM">
<text>Central FM is an Independent Local Radio station serving Falkirk, Stirling, Clackmannanshire and the Forth Valley. It is owned and operated by businessman John Quinn and broadcasts from studios at the Springkerse Industrial Estate in Stirling.

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 39,000, according to RAJAR.

== History ==
In December 1988, the Independent Broadcasting Authority announced it had chosen the Stirling area as one of twenty areas of the UK where new incremental radio licences were to be awarded. A month later, the regulator advertised the Stirling licence, permitting any station format.

&quot;Centresound&quot;, a community-based station founded by a local community association, began broadcasting on Monday 4 June 1990 from studios at the John Player Building in the Stirling Business Park but within two months, fell into financial difficulties due to problems in attracting enough investment to maintain an independent operation.

The board of directors resigned when the long-established Radio Forth went into partnership with Centresound after investing in the station. An overhaul saw the station relaunch as Central FM, sharing programming, news content and administration with Forth under an agreement. The move was criticised as being in commercial interests, rather than for the community&#x27;s benefit, but station manager Brian Hawkins argued the station was broadcasting more local output than before and no complaints had been received. The Radio Authority went on to award a new ten-year licence to Central FM in December 1993.

The station continued to record a loss, and in 1996, Radio Investments Ltd gained control after increasing its stake to 60%, ending the partnership with Radio Forth and leading to the station relocating to studios in Falkirk. Later, the controlling share passed onto The Local Radio Company, with 20% held by EMAP and the rest by independent investors.

Chairman, John Quinn took control of Central FM in 2008. In October 2012, the station returned to Stirling with the opening of new studios at the Springkerse Industrial Estate. In August 2013, Central FM began broadcasting on DAB across Central Scotland.

On 1 December 2016, three online-only stations were launched under the Central FM brand; Central FM Chart (playing non-stop hits), Central FM Country (24-hour current and classic country hits) and Central FM Gold (non-stop &#x27;60s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s hits). All are accessible from the station website and downloadable app. These online stations have now ceased transmission.

==Awards==
Central FM won the Scotland category in the Radio Academy Nations and Regions Awards twice in 2008 and 2011. It also won the Sony Gold Award for best UK station (in a TSA under 300,000 listeners) in 2012 and placed in the top three of stations (TSA under 500,000 listeners) at the 2013 Arqiva Commercial Radio Awards and won the Silver Award for Station of The Year at The Arqiva Radio Awards 2015.

==Programming==
The majority of Central FM&#x27;s programming is produced and broadcast from its Stirling studios. Presenter-led programming airs from 6 am to 7 pm from Monday - Friday, 7am to 6pm on Saturdays and 7am to 10pm on Sundays.

The station&#x27;s presenters include Alan Edwards (Weekday Breakfast), Sharon Oakley (Weekday Breakfast), Tony McQue (Weekday Daytime), Kevin John (Weekday Drivetime), Daimen Richards (Weekend Breakfast), Brian Woolfson (Weekend Daytime), Stuart Smith (Saturday Afternoons), John Mulgrew (Sunday Afternoons) &amp; Gavin &amp; Hannah (Sunday Evenings).

<doc id="956310" wikidata="Q638412" url="?curid=956310" title="Encore (Eminem album)">
<text>Encore is the fifth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on November 12, 2004, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. As reflected in its title, cover art, and certain lyrics, the album was originally set to be Eminem&#x27;s final studio album. Its lyrical themes include Eminem&#x27;s criticism of the 43rd U.S. president, George W. Bush, parodies of singer Michael Jackson and actor Christopher Reeve, and Eminem&#x27;s feud with fellow rappers Benzino and Ja Rule. Overall, the album features more comedic themes and lyrics than Eminem&#x27;s previous albums.

&quot;Encore&quot; was met with mixed to positive reviews, with many critics deeming it inferior to its three predecessors. Most of the album&#x27;s middle portion was heavily criticized, though &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Mockingbird&quot; were particularly highly praised and have retrospectively been ranked as some of Eminem&#x27;s best songs. These two songs were released along with three other singles: &quot;Just Lose It&quot;, &quot;Encore&quot;, and &quot;Ass Like That&quot;. The album has sold 11 million copies worldwide and was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 17, 2004.

In retrospect, Eminem has stated that he believes &quot;Encore&quot; to be one of his worst albums, which he attributed to several songs intended to be part of the album being leaked prior to its official release, requiring him to hastily write and record new ones. These leaked songs were compiled into a bootleg album titled &quot;Straight from the Lab&quot;. Eminem later revealed that he was also struggling with drug addiction during much of &quot;Encore&quot;″s recording.

&quot;Encore&quot; was nominated for the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, though it lost to Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Late Registration&quot;, making it Eminem&#x27;s first studio album since &quot;Infinite&quot; not to win the Grammy Award in that category. It would also be Eminem&#x27;s last studio album until the release of &quot;Relapse&quot; in 2009.

==Background==
Prior to producing &quot;Encore&quot;, American rapper Marshall Bruce Mathers III, better known as Eminem, had released several other studio albums—&quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999), &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; (2002)—each to critical acclaim. However, Eminem became addicted to a number of drugs during this time, including Valium, Ambien, and Vicodin. In Amsterdam, where a large portion of &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; was recorded, Eminem would sometimes take MDMA with his mentor and fellow producer Dr. Dre before an extended recording session. In a cover story celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;XXL&quot; magazine, Eminem stated: &quot;So, I&#x27;m coming off &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; and going into &quot;Encore&quot; when my addiction started to get bad. I was taking Vicodin, Valium and alcohol.&quot; Eminem specifically recalled an interview with fellow rapper 50 Cent and hip-hop group G-Unit following their performance in Black Entertainment Television&#x27;s music video show &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, in which he was unable to understand any questions asked to him, requiring 50 Cent to answer for him.

Despite his worsening drug addiction, by 2004, Eminem had won nine Grammy Awards, as well as an Oscar Award for his starring role in the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot;. During the time Eminem was recording for &quot;Encore&quot; in 2003, he was also producing for artists signed to his record label Shady Records, including 50 Cent and Obie Trice. That year, 50 Cent and Trice released their debut studio albums, &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot;, respectively, to critical acclaim and commercial success. However, Shady Records inherited a feud between 50 Cent and rapper Ja Rule, as well as Ja Rule&#x27;s record label, Murder Inc. Records, which had led to multiple diss tracks, including one from Ja Rule in which he mentions Eminem, Dr. Dre, and Eminem&#x27;s daughter Hailie. Meanwhile, Eminem and his record label were feuding with rapper Benzino and Benzino&#x27;s hip-hop magazine, &quot;The Source&quot;, resulting in additional diss tracks. These events are referenced in &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot;, a song on &quot;Encore&quot;.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Encore&quot; was recorded at 54 Studio in Ferndale, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, though a portion of the album was recorded at Trans Continental in Orlando, Florida. Eight of the twenty tracks on the album were produced by Dr. Dre, who had produced songs for all of Eminem&#x27;s albums since &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;. Songwriters Luis Resto, Mike Elizondo, and Mark Batson also produced for the album.

In December 2003, seven songs recorded by Eminem were leaked online, including several songs intended to be part of &quot;Encore&quot;: &quot;We As Americans&quot;, &quot;Bully&quot;, and &quot;Love You More&quot;. All of these songs were compiled into a bootleg album titled &quot;Straight from the Lab&quot;. The leak required Eminem to travel to Los Angeles to record new songs for &quot;Encore&quot; with Dr. Dre. Eminem&#x27;s worsening drug addiction, coupled with the songs being written in a hurry, resulted in them having a more comedic tone. Eminem has stated that &quot;Encore&quot; &quot;would&#x27;ve been right there with &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; as far as its caliber&quot; had the songs not been leaked, and revealed that &quot;We As Americans&quot; was supposed to be the opening track, followed by &quot;Bully&quot;. &quot;We As Americans&quot; and &quot;Love You More&quot; were released on the deluxe edition bonus disc. &quot;Bully&quot;, a diss track toward Benzino, Ja Rule, and Murder Inc. Records, ultimately would not see an official release.

&quot;Christopher Reeves&quot; was a song originally intended to be the seventh track on the album, though it was cut after its namesake, Superman film actor Christopher Reeve, died of heart failure on October 10, 2004, a month prior to the album&#x27;s release. The song was later reworked and released 20 years later under the title &quot;Brand New Dance&quot; on Eminem&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;The Death of Slim Shady (Coup de Grâce)&quot; (2024).

==Lyrical themes==

Overall, &quot;Encore&quot; contains more comedic themes and lyrics than Eminem&#x27;s previous albums, including occasional toilet humour. As conveyed through the album&#x27;s title, cover art, and certain lyrics, &quot;Encore&quot; was originally set to be Eminem&#x27;s final studio album. Actor Christopher Reeve (referred to as &quot;Christopher Reeves&quot; by Eminem), known for his portrayal of the title character in the &quot;Superman&quot; film series, is mentioned in the songs &quot;My 1st Single&quot; and &quot;Rain Man&quot;; in the latter, Eminem states &quot;And let&#x27;s clear this up too; I ain&#x27;t got no beef with him either&quot; and &quot;He used to be like a hero to me&quot;. The album is interspersed with skits in which Eminem has phone calls with Paul Rosenberg, his music manager and entertainment attorney.

In &quot;Evil Deeds&quot;, the second track on the album, Eminem apologizes for being his &quot;mother&#x27;s evil seed&quot;, recounts his rejection as a youth, and notes how his relationship with his daughter Hailie has become complicated by his fame. The third track, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, features a verse from 50 Cent and a hook from Nate Dogg. In the fourth track, &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot;, Eminem describes his early years in Detroit and apologizes for disparaging an African-American girl who broke up with him in an old mixtape unearthed by &quot;The Source&quot;.

&quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot;, the fifth track on the album, interpolates the chorus of Martika&#x27;s &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot;. The song discusses 50 Cent&#x27;s feuds with Ja Rule and Murder Inc. as well as Eminem&#x27;s own feuds with Benzino and &quot;The Source&quot;, notes how hip-hop conflicts have turned fatal, and ends with Eminem offering a truce. &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; was released as the third single from the album on March 15, 2005. &quot;Mosh&quot;, the sixth track from the album, is a protest song targeting 43rd U.S. president George W. Bush, criticizing U.S. involvement in the Iraq War and encouraging listeners to vote Bush out of office in the 2004 United States presidential election.

The album&#x27;s seventh track, &quot;Puke&quot;, targets Eminem&#x27;s ex-wife, Kim Scott, and includes sound effects of the rapper vomiting. The eighth track, &quot;My 1st Single&quot;, rejects being a radio-friendly single through inappropriate lyrics and sound effects. In the tenth track, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, Eminem declares that his &quot;new name is Rain Man&quot;, compares himself to a superhero, and mocks homophobia. &quot;Rain Man&quot; is followed by &quot;Big Weenie&quot;, in which Eminem attempts to hypnotize the listener, likely intended to be Benzino, and accuses him of being jealous of Eminem&#x27;s success.

The thirteenth track on the album, &quot;Just Lose It&quot;, features lyrics targeting Michael Jackson—including ones referencing the singer&#x27;s child sexual abuse allegations—as well as Eminem impersonating comedy character Pee-wee Herman. The song was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 27, 2004.

==Artwork and packaging==
The first of two covers for the album features Eminem standing in front of an audience, bowing to the crowd. The tray insert features Eminem holding a gun behind his back, while the inlay shows Eminem holding the pistol, a Smith &amp; Wesson Sigma, in his mouth without his jacket on. The CD itself shows a suicide note written by Eminem saying &quot;To my family &amp; all my friends -- thank you for everything, I will always love you. To my fans, I&#x27;m sorry, Marshall&quot; with a bullet underneath, which is also seen in the album&#x27;s booklet, where Eminem is writing the note. Some pictures show Eminem shooting everyone in the audience and himself, alluding to the ending of the album&#x27;s title track. The second album cover, used for the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, features the same audience from the inlay on a black background with a blood splat on the top right.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Encore&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with more of a negative response compared to Eminem&#x27;s past three albums. The review aggregation website Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, gave the album an average score of 64, based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Josh Love from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; felt Eminem was &quot;dying&quot; with this album, whose concept was &quot;end-to-end mea culpa&quot;, full of &quot;clarifications, rectifications and excuses&quot;, revising the history of &quot;a man who knows he doesn&#x27;t have much time left&quot;. Scott Plangenhoef, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called &quot;Encore&quot; a &quot;transitional record&quot; and &quot;the sound of a man who seems bored of re-branding and playing celebrity games&quot;. BBC Music&#x27;s Adam Webb believed it starts &quot;fantastically&quot; but ends &quot;abominably&quot;, writing that it has too many &quot;low points&quot;. David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said Eminem &quot;sacrifices the rich, multi-textured productions&quot; of his two previous albums for &quot;thug-life monotony, cultural zingers for petty music-biz score-settling, and probing self-analysis for juvenile humor&quot;. He concluded his review by saying that Eminem has become &quot;predictable&quot; on &quot;Encore&quot;, something that he wasn&#x27;t before.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine was more enthusiastic in his review for AllMusic, calling the music &quot;spartan&quot;, built on &quot;simple unadorned beats and keyboard loops&quot;, and the lyrics &quot;plain-spoken and literal&quot;. Robert Christgau said Eminem still sounded &quot;funny, catchy and clever, and irreverent past his allotted time&quot;, noting that even the bonus tracks &quot;keep on pushing&quot;. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he wrote that &quot;Encore&quot; was not as &quot;astonishing&quot; as &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot;, but praised Eminem for maturing his lyrical abilities while retaining his sense of humor. Steve Jones from &quot;USA Today&quot; also spoke positively about the album, calling Eminem&#x27;s producing and lyrical skills as &quot;top-flight&quot; and noting that the record explores &quot;the many sides of Marshall Mathers&quot;.

The album earned Eminem Grammy Award nominations in three categories at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards: Best Rap Album, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the song &quot;Encore&quot;, and Best Rap Solo Performance for the song &quot;Mockingbird&quot;.

Retrospectively, in a ranking of all 12 of Eminem&#x27;s studio albums, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Damien Scott placed &quot;Encore&quot; ninth, criticizing the songs on the back half of the album as &quot;some of the worst [Eminem]&#x27;s ever committed to tape&quot;, though he singled out &quot;Like Toy Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Mockingbird&quot; as &quot;some of Em&#x27;s strongest and most personal songs to date&quot; and wrote that &quot;&quot;Encore&quot; works as an earnest rumination on the things that really make Eminem tick&quot;. &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Christopher R. Weingarten placed &quot;Encore&quot; last in a 2019 ranking of Eminem&#x27;s first 10 studio albums, calling it &quot;a rambling disaster&quot;, which he partially attributed to Eminem&#x27;s drug addiction at the time. Kemet High of &quot;XXL&quot; magazine placed &quot;Encore&quot; seventh in his 2021 ranking of Eminem&#x27;s first 11 studio albums, believing that it &quot;has aged better with time&quot; despite being &quot;a step back in comparison to the three-album run of &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot;, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; and &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; that preceded it&quot;. &quot;HotNewHipHop&quot;″s Paul Barnes placed &quot;Encore&quot; second to last in his 2023 ranking of all of Eminem&#x27;s studio albums except &quot;Infinite&quot;, deeming many of the songs &quot;incoherent&quot;.

===Controversies===
&quot;Encore&quot; provoked some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that parodied and targeted Michael Jackson, who criticized Eminem&#x27;s depiction of him in the video for &quot;Just Lose It&quot; and threatened to sue him.

On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service stated it was &quot;looking into&quot; allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States, George Bush, after the song &quot;We As Americans&quot;, in an unreleased bootleg called Straight From The Lab, circulated with the lyrics &quot;Fuck money, I don&#x27;t rap for dead presidents. I&#x27;d rather see the president dead.&quot; This line was eventually used as a sample in Immortal Technique&#x27;s single &quot;Bin Laden&quot;, which featured Mos Def and Chuck D. The incident was later referenced in the video for his song &quot;Mosh&quot; as one of several news clips on a wall, along with other newspaper articles about other unfortunate incidents in Bush&#x27;s career. The song eventually appeared on the album&#x27;s bonus disc, with the word &quot;dead&quot; being reversed.

===Eminem&#x27;s thoughts on the album===
In retrospect, Eminem stated numerous times that he considers &quot;Encore&quot; as one of his worst albums. He described its reception, &quot;I&#x27;m cool with probably half that album. I recorded that towards the height of my addiction. I remember four songs leaked and I had to go to L.A. and get Dre and record new ones. I was in a room by myself writing songs in 25, and 30 minutes because we had to get it done, and what came out was so goofy. That&#x27;s how I ended up making songs like &#x27;Rain Man&#x27; and &#x27;Big Weenie&#x27;. They&#x27;re pretty out there. If those other songs hadn&#x27;t leaked, &quot;Encore&quot; would&#x27;ve been a different album.&quot; In an interview with Sway Calloway for his album &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, he stated that although &quot;&quot;Encore&quot;... [is] not what I would consider one of my better albums&quot;, he considered it better than its follow-up &quot;Relapse&quot;. He reiterated his statement about &quot;Encore&quot; in 2022 for the 25th anniversary issue of &quot;XXL&quot;: &quot;It became a misstep and I struggled to get over the fact that I didn&#x27;t do my best. My best would&#x27;ve been good enough if the leaks hadn&#x27;t happened. But I released what I had at that point in time, and I feel that put a kind of a mark on my catalog. &quot;Encore&quot; did some decent numbers, but I was never that concerned with numbers. I was more so worried about what people think about the album. Critics and fans were important to me, and they were always at me about that project.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Encore&quot; was released on November 12, 2004. The release date was moved up from the originally planned November 16 to countermeasure leaks. The album sold 710,000 copies. The following week, the album&#x27;s first with a full seven days, it moved 871,000 copies, bringing the 10-day total to 1,582,000. It was certified quadruple-platinum that mid-December. Nine months after its release, worldwide sales of the album stood at 11 million copies. The album made digital history in becoming the first album to sell 10,000 digital copies in one week. As of November 2013, the album had sold 5,343,000 copies in the US.

&quot;Encore&quot; sold 125,000 copies in two days in the United Kingdom, and has been certified quadruple-platinum.

<text>Hits Radio Dorset is an Independent Local Radio station owned and operated by Bauer as part of the Hits Radio Network. The station broadcasts to Bournemouth, Poole, and Christchurch, Dorset from studios outside its broadcast area, in Segensworth in Fareham.

The station was originally launched on 26 June 1999 by founding Directors James Bromley and David Harber as FM 107.6 The NRG, but changed name a year later following a dispute with French radio station NRJ. The station is now owned and operated by Bauer Radio

As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 29,000, according to RAJAR.

==History==
The NRG (Nerve Radio Group) was born out of the Bournemouth student station Nerve* Radio. The launch team included David and Emily at Breakfast, Max Hailey, James &quot;Lloydie&quot; Lloyd and Dan Lodge on the schedule. A range of specialist DJs were included in the schedule, such as Jay Ratchett, Ross EB, Jon Langford, Michael Artwell and Jez Welham. Specialist programmes also included &quot;Club Versive&quot; hosted by Boy George, and the &quot;Ministry of Sound Dance Party&quot;.

===Name change===
French broadcaster NRJ challenged &quot;The NRG&quot; over the use of the name as the pronunciation was the same. In discussion with the station&#x27;s solicitors (Stephens Innocent) the station management agreed that although there was a &quot;chance&quot; that the Bournemouth station could win the challenge – and even if not, they could go to Appeal and &quot;almost certainly&quot; win – the costs involved in challenging one of Europe&#x27;s biggest radio brands would be too high for a small station on the South Coast of the UK. Despite the notion of &#x27;borrowing station names&#x27;, Managing Director David Harber renamed the station &quot;The Fire&quot; after a Chicago-based station &quot;WFYR&quot; which had been &#x27;off-air&#x27; for a number of years. The station changed name on Bonfire Night, 2000.

===Studios===

The station moved from the original studios in the Quadrant Shopping Centre, to purpose-built studios at the Picture House on Holdenhurst Road in Bournemouth in June 2007. The station now broadcasts from the Celador studios in Southampton.

===Ownership===

The station was sold by its original founders in October 2001 to Radio Investments Limited, which later became known as The Local Radio Company.

The Local Radio Company then sold Fire 107.6 to Westward Broadcasting in June 2009.

Celador Radio purchased Fire in July 2014. In February 2019, Fire was then sold to Bauer Radio

===Hits Radio Bournemouth and Poole===

On 6 September 2021, Fire Radio was renamed Hits Radio Bournemouth and Poole with Fleur East at Breakfast and Jono Holmes on drivetime. Max and Jason moved to drivetime on Hits Radio Bristol &amp; The South West launching on the same day.

== Programming ==
Local programming airs 10am-1pm on weekdays from Bauer’s Fareham studios. 

At all other times networked programming airs via Bauer’s London headquarters or studios in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle.

==News==
Bauer&#x27;s Fareham newsroom broadcasts local news bulletins hourly from 6am-7pm on weekdays, and from 7am-1pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows, alongside traffic bulletins.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried overnight with bespoke networked bulletins on weekend afternoons, usually originating from Bauer&#x27;s Manchester newsroom.

<doc id="956313" wikidata="Q7163441" url="?curid=956313" title="Pennine FM">
<text>Pennine FM was an Independent Local Radio station based at Lockwood Park in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England. The station closed on 5 April 2010 and returned its licence to the industry regulator Ofcom.

==Background==
The station was originally launched as &quot;Huddersfield FM&quot; by the Minster Sound Radio Group plc in October 1999. The station was bought by Radio Investments Limited and GWR in November 1999, then completely by Radio Investments (now The Local Radio Company) in December 2000 and renamed &quot;Home 107.9&quot;. It broadcast from studios at The Old Stableblock, Lockwood Park, Huddersfield. Though popular music was the staple, community output was prominent on the station with content reflecting the diversity of the local communities.

In February 2008, &quot;Home 107.9&quot; was rebranded as &quot;The New Pennine FM&quot;, and by June 2008 it had left The Local Radio Company profile and was taken over independently. However, they still took some of TLRC&#x27;s networked shows such as &quot;The Lunchtime Gameshow&quot; broadcast from Minster FM in York on Sundays at 12 noon, hosted by John Harding and Russ Leighton.

On 16 April 2009, &quot;The New Pennine FM&quot; was put into administration and taken off the air. It is understood that the owners were heavily in debt to Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club which leased their premises to the station. In the weeks following the station closure, the 107.9 frequency continued to play the Pennine FM back up disc from their transmitter. Ofcom noted this breach in their Bulletin Issue.

On 7 May 2009, the station was bought by Pennine Media Ltd. The new owners appointed Jonathan Gold as Programme Director and Dave Stankler as Commercial Director. The station was then branded as &quot;Pennine FM, Huddersfield&#x27;s More Music Station&quot; and aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds, playing a mix of classic and current hits.

==2010 closure==
On 5 April 2010, it was announced on air that Pennine FM will close at 10p.m. that day and that the licence will be handed back to Ofcom. The station closed four hours earlier, at 18:00, and the last song played was Sleeping Satellite by Tasmin Archer. A test tone was heard immediately after the final sweeper.

==Technical==
The signal was at a relatively low power (100w vertical polarization, 100w horizontal polarization) and was broadcast from a transmitter at a site owned by Yorkshire Electricity Distribution PLC (YEDL) at Ainley Top, near the M62. The signal power was low to protect the aircraft communication band. The RDS name was &quot;PENNINE&quot;

==Branding==
Huddersfield FM&#x27;s jingle packages were produced by JAM Creative Productions and Steve England.

In January 2007, when the station was still Home 107.9, they began using a jingle package produced by the Bespoke Music Company, as did many other stations owned by the Local Radio Company. To complement the new jingles, the station&#x27;s strap line was changed from &quot;music:fun:life&quot; to &quot;from Huddersfield with West Yorkshire&#x27;s greatest hits.&quot;

When the station became Pennine FM, another batch of idents were produced by JonesTM which incorporated &quot;the New Pennine FM&quot; moniker.

<text>Yaghnobi is an Eastern Iranian language spoken in the upper valley of the Yaghnob River in the Zarafshan area of Tajikistan by the Yaghnobi people. It is considered to be a direct descendant of Sogdian and has sometimes been called Neo-Sogdian in academic literature. There are some 12,500 Yaghnobi speakers, divided into several communities. The principal group lives in the Zafarobod area. There are also resettlers in the Yaghnob Valley. Some communities live in the villages of Zumand and Kůkteppa and in Dushanbe or its vicinity.

Most Yaghnobi speakers are bilingual in Tajik, a dialect of Persian. Yaghnobi is mostly used for daily family communication, and Tajik is used by Yaghnobi-speakers for business and formal transactions. A Russian ethnographer was told by nearby Tajiks, long hostile to the Yaghnobis, who were late to adopt Islam, that the Yaghnobis used their language as a &quot;secret&quot; mode of communication to confuse the Tajiks. The account led to the belief by some that Yaghnobi or some derivative of it was used as a secret code.

The language is taught in elementary school within the ethnic community, and Tajikistan has also enacted legislation to support education in minority languages, including Yaghnobi.

There are two main dialects: a western and an eastern one. They differ primarily in phonetics. For example, historical &quot;*θ&quot; corresponds to &quot;t&quot; in the western dialects and &quot;s&quot; in the eastern: &quot;met&quot; – &quot;mes&quot; &#x27;day&#x27; from Sogdian &quot;mēθ&quot; . Western &quot;ay&quot; corresponds to Eastern &quot;e&quot;: &quot;wayš&quot; – &quot;weš&quot; &#x27;grass&#x27; from Sogdian &quot;wayš&quot; or &quot;wēš&quot; . The early Sogdian group &quot;θr&quot; (later &quot;ṣ̌&quot;) is reflected as &quot;sar&quot; in the east but &quot;tir&quot; in the west: &quot;saráy&quot; – &quot;tiráy&quot; &#x27;three&#x27; from Sogdian &quot;θrē&quot;/&quot;θray&quot; or &quot;ṣ̌ē&quot;/&quot;ṣ̌ay&quot; . There are also some differences in verbal endings and the lexicon. In between the two main dialects is a transitional dialect that shares some features of both other dialects.

==Writing==
Yaghnobi was mostly unwritten until recent times, but according to Andreyev, some of the Yaghnobi scholars used the Persian script for writing the language before 1928, mainly when they needed to hide some information from the Tajiks.

Nowadays, the language is largely transcribed by scholars using a modified Latin alphabet, with the following symbols:

In the 1990s, Sayfiddin Mirzozoda of the Tajik Academy of Sciences introduced a modified Tajik alphabet for writing Yaghnobi, in addition to several textbooks intended to for elementary school students. The shared orthography between Tajik and Yaghnobi transliterated according to Mirzozoda’s scheme offered the promise of improved literacy among Tajik-literate Yaghnobi youth, but since 2006 the Tajik government has stopped providing funding for the printing of Yaghnobi textbooks and the hiring of teachers of Yaghnobi, and so these efforts have largely stagnated. Additionally, Mirzozoda&#x27;s method of transliteration presents a few notable drawbacks in that it does not distinguish between the short and long forms of every vowel, it does not distinguish between and , and it has no inherent markings for the indication of stress, as can be seen in Mirzozoda&#x27;s alphabet, reproduced with its IPA correspondences in this table below.
===Cyrillic script===
The Yaghnobi Alphabet was same as Tajik but with Ԝ.

Notes to Cyrillic:
# The letter &quot;й&quot; never appears at the beginning of a word. Words beginning with &quot;ya-&quot;, &quot;yo-&quot; and &quot;yu-/yū-/yʏ&quot; are written as &quot;я-&quot;, &quot;ё-&quot; and &quot;ю-&quot;, and the combinations are written in the middle of the word: &quot;viyóra&quot; is &quot;виёра&quot; .
# Use of &quot;ӣ&quot; and &quot;ӯ&quot; is uncertain, but they seem to distinguish two similar-sounding words: and , and . Perhaps &quot;ӣ&quot; is also used as a stress marker as it is also in Tajik, and &quot;ӯ&quot; can also be used in Tajik loanwords to indicate a Tajik vowel , but it can have some other unknown use.
# In older texts, the alphabet did not use letters &quot;Ъ ъ&quot; and &quot;Э э&quot;. Instead of Tajik &quot;ъ&quot;, Yaghnobi &quot;’&quot; and &quot;е&quot; covered both Tajik &quot;е&quot; and &quot;э&quot; for . Later, the letters were integrated into the alphabet so the older was changed into to represent the pronunciation (and not ). Older was changed to .
# and are written &quot;е&quot; and &quot;и&quot;. Yaghnobi &quot;и&quot; can be after a vowel like in Tajik, and &quot;ӣ&quot; after a vowel is . Also, &quot;е&quot; has two values: word-initially and after a vowel, it is pronounced , but after a consonant, it is . is rare in Yaghnobi and is only in Tajik or Russian loans, the only example for is , a Russian loanword.
# Russian letters &quot;Ц ц&quot;, &quot;Щ щ&quot;, &quot;Ы ы&quot; and &quot;Ь ь&quot;, which can be used in Tajik loans from Russian, are not used in Yaghnobi. They are written as they are pronounced by the Yaghnobi speakers, not as they are written originally in Russian: &quot;aeroplane&quot; is in Russian, written in Tajik and pronounced in Russian and in Tajik. In Yaghnobi, it is written as and follows the Yaghnobi pronunciation or . The word &quot;concert&quot; is borrowed from Russian in the form ). Compare with Tajik .

==Phonology==
Yaghnobi includes 9 monophthongs (3 short, 6 long), 8 diphthongs, and 27 consonants.

===Vowels===

The diphthongs in Yaghnobi are . only appears in native words in the western dialects, eastern dialects have in its place, except in loanwords.

* The monophthongs have these allophonic variants:
** : 
** : 
** : 
** : 
* was the result of compensatory lengthening ().
* In recent loans from Tajik and/or Uzbek can also appear, but its pronunciation usually merges to .
* is only recognised by some authorities. It seems that it is an allophone of , originating from historical stressed *&quot;ū&quot;, but historical *&quot;ō&quot;, changed in Yaghnobi to &quot;ū&quot;, remains unchanged. It seems that is unstable, and it is not recorded in all varieties of Yaghnobi. It is often realised as , as well as . By summary: *&quot;ū́&quot; &quot;(under stress)&quot; &gt; &quot;ū/ūy/uy/ʏ&quot; or &quot;ū&quot;, *&quot;ō&quot; &gt; &quot;ū&quot; ( &quot;goat&quot;; , ). 
* Before a nasal, can change to , e.g. &quot;Tajikistan&quot;, &quot;name&quot;.
* is considered as a long vowel, however before , its pronunciation is somewhat shorter, and is realised as a half-short (or even short) vowel. Etymologically, the &quot;short&quot; &quot;e&quot; before comes from older *&quot;i&quot; (there is an alternation &quot;e/i&quot; before ) if the historical cluster &quot;*ih&quot; or &quot;*iع&quot; appears in a closed syllable, and &quot;*i&quot; changes to &quot;e&quot;. In open syllables, the change did not take place (that is similar to Tajik). The change can be seen in the verb &quot;dih-/deh-&quot;: infinitive vs. 3rd sg. present .
* In Yaghnobi dialects, there can be seen a different development of historical svarabhakti vowel: in the Western and Transitional dialects, it is rendered as (or under certain circumstances), but in the Eastern dialects it changes to (but also or ): &quot;*θray&quot; &gt; &quot;*θəráy&quot; &gt; W./Tr. &quot;tiráy&quot; vs. E. &quot;saráy&quot; but &quot;*βrāt&quot; &gt; &quot;*vərāt&quot; &gt; W./Tr./E. &quot;virót&quot;.&lt;br&gt;When the second vowel is a back vowel, &quot;*ə&quot; usually changes to in Western or Transitional dialects: &quot;*(čə)θβār&quot; &gt; &quot;*tfār&quot; &gt; &quot;*təfór&quot; &gt; W./Tr. &quot;tufór&quot; (but also &quot;tifór&quot;) vs. E. &quot;tafór&quot;, &quot;*pδūfs-&quot; &gt; &quot;*bədū́fs&quot; &gt; W./Tr./E. &quot;budū́fs-&quot;. The later change appears also in morphology: verb &quot;tifárak&quot; (the form is same in all three dialects) has form in 3rd sg. present &quot;tufórči&quot; &lt; &quot;*təfár-&quot; &lt; &quot;*tfar-&quot; &lt; &quot;*θβar-&quot;. The alternation can be seen also in Tajik loans where an unstressed vowel can undergo this change: W./Tr. &quot;širī́k&quot; vs. E. &quot;šarī́k&quot; &lt; Tajik &quot;/šarīk/&quot; &quot;partner&quot;, W./Tr. &quot;xipár&quot; vs. E. &quot;xapár&quot; &lt; Tajik &quot;/xabar/&quot; &quot;news&quot;. The former svarabhakti vowels are often ultra-short or reduced in pronunciation, and they can even disappear in fast speech: &quot;xišáp /xišáp&quot; vs. &quot;xⁱšáp&quot; vs. &quot;xšap/&quot; &lt; &quot;*xəšáp&quot; &lt; &quot;*xšap&quot;.
* The changes to in verbal stems of type -Car- if an ending containing historic &quot;*θ&quot; or &quot;*t&quot; is added: &quot;tifár-&quot;, infinitive &quot;tifárak&quot;, 1st sg. present &quot;tifarómišt&quot; but 3rd sg. present &quot;tufórči&quot; (ending &quot;-či&quot; comes from older &quot;-tišt&quot;), 2nd pl. present W./Tr. &quot;tufórtišt&quot; E. &quot;tufórsišt&quot;, &quot;x°ar-: x°árak : x°arómišt : xórči : xórtišt/xórsišt&quot; (when changes to after , loses its labilisation). The change takes place with all verbs of Yaghnobi origin and also with older loans from Tajik. For new loans, &quot;a&quot; remains unchanged.: &quot;gudár(ak) : gudórči&quot; vs. &quot;pár(ak) : párči&quot;: the first verb is an old loan from Tajik &quot;guzaštan &lt; guδaštan&quot;, the later a recent loan from &quot;parrīdan&quot;.

===Consonants===

* and are palatalised to and respectively before a front vowel or after a front vowel word-finally.
* appears as an allophone between vowels or voiced consonants.
* , both have allophones and before and , respectively
* All voiced consonants are pronounced voiceless at the end of the word when after an unvoiced consonant comes a voiced one. Likewise, unvoiced consonants become voiced by assimilation. In voicing &quot;q&quot;, the voiced opposition is , not .
* The consonants , , , , , , , appear mostly in loanwords. Native words with those sounds are rare and mostly onomatopoeic.

==Morphology==
&quot;W&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Tr.&quot; refer to the Western, Eastern and Transitional dialects.

===Noun===
Case endings:
Examples:
* kat: obl.sg. &quot;káti&quot;, pl. &quot;katt&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;kátti&quot;
* mayn (W) / men (E) : obl.sg. &quot;máyni/méni&quot;, pl. &quot;maynt/ment&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;máynti/ménti&quot;
* póda : obl.sg. &quot;póday/póde&quot;, pl. &quot;pódot&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;pódoti&quot;
* čalló : obl.sg. &quot;čallóy&quot;, pl. &quot;čallót&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;čallóti&quot;
* zindagī́ : obl.sg. &quot;zindagī́y&quot;, pl. &quot;zindagī́t&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;zindagī́ti&quot;
* mórti : obl.sg. &quot;mórtiy&quot;, pl. &quot;mórtit&quot;, obl.pl. &quot;mórtiti&quot;
* Also, the izofa construction is used in Yaghnobi and appears in phrases and constructions adopted from Tajik or with words of Tajik origin.

===Pronouns===
The second person plural, &quot;šumóx&quot; is also used as the polite form of the second person pronoun.

===Numerals===
===Verb===
Personal endings – present:

Personal endings – preterite (with augment &quot;a-&quot;):
By adding the ending &quot;-išt&quot; (&quot;-št&quot; after a vowel; but &quot;-or+išt&quot; &gt; &quot;-ošt&quot;) to the preterite, the durative preterite is formed.

The present participle is formed by adding &quot;-na&quot; to the verbal stem. Past participle (or perfect participle) is formed by addition of &quot;-ta&quot; to the stem.

The infinitive is formed by addition of ending &quot;-ak&quot; to the verbal stem.

Negation is formed by prefix &quot;na-&quot;, in combination with augment in preterite it changes to &quot;nē-&quot;.

The copula is this:

==Lexicon==
Knowledge of Yaghnobi lexicon comes from three main works: from a Yaghnobi-Russian dictionary presented in &quot;Yaghnobi Texts&quot; by Andreyev and Peščereva and then from a supplementary word list presented in &quot;Yaghnobi Grammar&quot; by Xromov. The last work is &quot;Yaghnobi-Tajik Dictionary&quot; compiled by Xromov&#x27;s student, Sayfiddīn Mīrzozoda, himself a Yaghnobi native speaker. Persian words represent the majority of the lexicon (some 60%), followed by words of Turkic origin (up to 5%, mainly from Uzbek) and a few Russian words (about 2%; through the Russian language, also many international words came to Yaghnobi). Only a third of the lexicon is of Eastern-Iranian origin and can be easily comparable to those known from Sogdian, Ossetian, the Pamir languages or Pashto.

A Yaghnobi-Czech dictionary was published in 2010 by the Charles University Faculty of Arts.

<text>Colonial Club is one of the eleven current eating clubs of Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. Founded in 1891, it is the fifth oldest of the clubs. It is located on 40 Prospect Avenue.

A private social club for undergraduates at Princeton University, the club was referred to as &quot;flamboyant Colonial&quot; in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, and was defined as being one of the &quot;top five&quot; clubs along with Ivy, Cottage, Cap &amp; Gown, and Tiger Inn. As the first eating club to both abandon the selective bicker process and become coeducational in 1969, Colonial Club has been heralded for its progressive legacy.

Colonial Club has been affiliated with over 7 Rhodes Scholars and several Valedictorians of Princeton University. Among the Princetonians who were involved in the World War II code-breaking at Bletchley Park,
some were allegedly from Colonial Club.

The club has served as the primary social scene for several notable alumni during their undergraduate years, including former Colonial Club Vice President Joseph Nye &#x27;58, co-founder of the international relations theory of neoliberalism, Pete Conrad &#x27;53, third man to walk on the Moon, Eric Schmidt &#x27;76, executive chairman of Alphabet Inc. and former CEO of Google, and Ted Cruz &#x27;92, U.S. Senator and candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 election.

== Clubhouse ==
The club occupies a large mansion on the north side of Prospect Avenue in Princeton, NJ. The building is easily recognizable by its four large white columns fashioned in Colonial style. The current building has served as the clubhouse for Colonial since 1906. After originally occupying several locations farther away from campus, the current house was built during a time of strong rivalry between eating clubs, across the street from rival clubs Ivy and Cottage.

Colonial&#x27;s first clubhouse was located on 306 Nassau Street and served as the club&#x27;s residence for only one year. In 1892, the club moved to a house on 186 Nassau Street fashioned in the period&#x27;s cottage architecture, featuring a front facade in the Queen Anne style. The club subsequently moved to Prospect Avenue in 1897, taking over the old Ivy Club house and changing the exterior by adding decorative columns and enlarging the lower floor. This third clubhouse lasted 9 years until the current clubhouse was built, funded by the issuance of bonds to graduate members and alumni. The new clubhouse was designed by associated architects Robert W. Gibson and Francis G. Stewart of New York City.

The current clubhouse features a wide variety of facilities, including a large foyer, cloak room, dining hall, kitchen, library, home theatre, game and billiards room, taproom, computer cluster, offices, various study rooms, and over a dozen bedrooms. The club&#x27;s undergraduate officers reside in the mansion&#x27;s third floor.

=== Early history ===

==== Foundation ====
Founded in 1891 under the presidency of H.P. &#x27;Bert&#x27; Fisher &#x27;93, the club was formed by a group of 13 Princeton University juniors, who originally called themselves the &quot;Plug and Ulster Club.&quot; The club&#x27;s founders initially encountered opposition by the president of the college, Reverend Francis L. Patton, who opposed to the establishment of a boy&#x27;s club adjacent to Evelyn College, Princeton&#x27;s coordinate women&#x27;s college. After agreeing to several provisions, Colonial Club was founded and situated itself in an old Virginian, three-story veranda house. The original section consisted of several notable students including Booth Tarkington, founder of the Princeton Triangle Club. The club later was formerly incorporated in 1896 as The Colonial Club of Princeton University.

==== Great War Era ====
After the sinking of the Lusitania, military training became the principal activity on campus. Only a few of the eating clubs remained open during this time. Colonial Club temporarily considered combining with Tiger Inn until the full membership of the various clubs returned to college after the war. Almost the entire 1917 section left college to enter various branches of service, and the entirety of the 1919 section was drafted, leading to the closing of the club. Several club members perished during World War I, including John G. Agar Jr. &#x27;14, Joseph M. Duff Jr. &#x27;12, Gordon C. Gregory &#x27;18, and Samuel F. Pogue &#x27;04. Colonial Club&#x27;s 1920 section managed to revive the club after the war, under the guidance of W. Irving Harris &#x27;20 and Harvey S. Firestone Jr. &#x27;20, who later was chairman of the board of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company.

==== Great Depression and WWII ====
Surprisingly, Colonial Club enjoyed its biggest years in the thirties. The original 1933 section of thirty men was the largest that had ever entered the club up to that time, most of whom were students in the university&#x27;s Politics Department. According to the Colonial Club 100th Anniversary Book, the most striking feature of the club proved to be the members&#x27; &quot;bland unawareness of the significance of outside events in those days...few believed that the invasion of Manchuria or Hitler&#x27;s rise to power carried a personal threat to us.&quot;
Colonial Club&#x27;s tradition of having its formal club dinners in New York began in 1934 in an effort to bring together graduate and undergraduate members. The tradition has continued into the 21st century, with member and alumni dinners commonly held at the Princeton Club of New York.

In the 1940s, Colonial Club continued to hold its place as one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; socially prominent eating clubs, along with Ivy, Cottage, Cap &amp; Gown, and Tiger Inn. At the time, 80% of the members came from private preparatory schools, largely in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, with the primary campus activity being Triangle Club and crew. Membership dropped during World War II, with over 18 members ranging from the 1914 section to the 1941 section perishing in the conflict.

==== Cold War era ====
After the world war, however, Colonial&#x27;s extravagant style and activities returned to the club&#x27;s normal affairs. Nearly $15,000 (around $150,000 in 2016) was once spent to hire Lester Lanin&#x27;s Orchestra, and parties reminiscent of those in the Roaring Twenties became a staple of club life. By the end of the 50s, many of the traditional social amenities of earlier eras began to fade; buffet style became fashionable in lieu of the club&#x27;s traditional white tablecloths, linen napkins, and waiters.

In the 60s, the club experienced several changes. The clubhouse&#x27;s third floor bedrooms, which long held the staff of waiters, were renovated into rooms for members. Variable section sizes and a drop in alumni financial support occasionally led to tough financial situations for the club. During this time, Colonial became the first of the clubs to go non-selective in 1969. This move, strongly encouraged by university officials, coincided with the club&#x27;s admittance of female members. Unlike some of the other eating clubs including Ivy Club, which did not allow women until a lawsuit in 1991, Colonial permitted women to join once Princeton University began to admit women as undergraduates in the same year. The inclusion of women in the club&#x27;s daily life noticeably led to more small parties and events around the clubhouse.
The club&#x27;s financial difficulties gradually continued into the 70s and 80s, during which the club&#x27;s Graduate Board of Governors considered closing the club. Efforts by several of the undergraduate officers, including president Jaime Isbester and vice president April Gilbert, kept the club afloat via a fundraising campaign that raised more than $650,000 (over $2 million in 2016). Graduate members including Jack Dorrance &#x27;41, then chairman of the Campbell Soup Company, single-handedly donated over $100,000 in the club&#x27;s Centennial Campaign.

=== Modern history ===

==== 2000s ====

Interest in the club reached a low point in 1999 when only 26 members of the class of 2001 signed into Colonial. Aggressive event planning by the classes of 2000 and 2001, along with generous alumni support and an enthusiastic and dedicated class of 2002, brought the club back from the brink. This was at least the third time the club had been rescued from near-oblivion; 1982 and 1988 also had seen very low sign-in numbers. In 2010, however, Colonial managed to recruit only 13 members in the first round of sign-ins; this was a massive drop from the 87 first round sign-ins from the previous year. The club was still able to attract a substantial number of new members during the second round of sign-ins that same year. In 2011, a huge turnaround occurred when over 130 sophomores signed into the club, which was the largest number of sophomores to join any of the eating clubs.

Throughout this period, the club has seen both the size and demographics of each section shift drastically. Nonetheless, the openness of the club, as demonstrated in 1969, remained a hallmark of the club&#x27;s culture and shaped the club into the next decade.

== Club culture ==

=== Activities and traditions ===

Continuing its established traditions originating from the Roaring Twenties, Colonial frequently hosts events for its members and guests including game nights, intramural sports, semiformals, and winter and spring house parties. The club also participates in events such as trivia night, club field days, bonfires, outdoor BBQs, and therapy dog study breaks.

As with other the eating clubs, Colonial has participated in the university&#x27;s annual Lawnparties music festival, hosting artists such as Between Friends, Crash Adams, and Weston Estate in recent years. Traditions at Colonial include its annual medieval feast and thesis phrase, where members attempt to insert a humorous line into their Princeton University senior thesis.
Colonial&#x27;s large, white columns are often seen illuminated by lights on Friday nights, when the club is open to students of Princeton University and other members of the Princeton community.

As an eating club, Colonial members often have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the clubhouse daily, with brunch served on the weekends. The club&#x27;s buffet-style meals often feature an open grill, smoothie station, and panini bar. Other popular options include the club&#x27;s fresh oysters, BBQ ribs, udon, fish tacos, Korean short ribs, and pork buns. In the 1960s, Colonial was the second of the eating clubs to offer a vegetarian contract, which was slightly cheaper than the regular meal plan offered to members.

=== Academics and community service ===
Colonial has been committed to maintaining a rigorous scholarly community and providing professional opportunities to its members. The club&#x27;s Professor Dinner Series allows members and guests to debate and discuss various topics with university professors, who are invited weekly to the club to discuss their research or engage in conversation. Furthermore, the club manages a student-run portfolio of over $100,000 in assets under management (AUM) and hosts its own in-house software development team.

Colonial Club has enjoyed a long-standing partnership with the Princeton-Blairstown Center, a program founded in 1908 by Princeton University students and faculty that attempts to transform the lives of young people through character-building experiences. The club holds an annual charity talent show in order to raise money for a variety of nonprofit organizations including HomeFront NJ. In addition, Colonial Club is noted for its enthusiasm towards influenza vaccines, leading all Princeton eating clubs in flu shots for H1N1, H5N1, and every major flu strain seen since 1975. This was sparked by Colonial&#x27;s loss of 90% of its members to the 1918 flu pandemic.

=== Management ===

As with the past century, Colonial Club is managed by the Graduate Board of Governors, composed of graduate members of the club, and the Undergraduate Officers, who are elected each December. Colonial Club&#x27;s executive chef, Gilberto Ramirez, has been in post for over 11 years. Ramirez graduated from the French Culinary Institute and previously worked at TPC Jasna Polana. The club is also directed by a club manager, Kathleen Galante, who oversees day-to-day affairs.

Colonial Club celebrated its 125th anniversary under graduate president Joseph Studholme &#x27;84, who has led the board since 2009, and undergraduate president Christopher J. Yu &#x27;17. Continuing its 1934 tradition of having formal member-alumni dinners, the club held its 125th Anniversary Celebration with a cruise dinner aboard the Atlantica Yacht on the New York Harbor.

== Notable alumni ==

Pete Conrad &#x27;53, the third man to walk on the Moon, was a Colonial member. Conrad carried five Princeton flags to the Moon; he later gave one to the club. This memento was destroyed in a fire while it was being framed for display at Colonial&#x27;s &quot;Burn Baby Burn&quot; Pyrotechnic extravaganza.

Other famous Colonial alumni include the late Rhode Island senator Claiborne Pell &#x27;40, famous for creation of Pell grants in 1973; novelist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Booth Tarkington, who was a member of the original &quot;Ye Plug and Ulster,&quot; which became Colonial; Norman Thomas 1905, the chief Socialist in the United States and Socialist candidate in every presidential election from 1928 to 1948; noted Princeton illustrator William B. Pell 1898; Eric Schmidt &#x27;76, former CEO of Google; and Edward F. Cox &#x27;68, who married Tricia Nixon in the Rose Garden at the White House in 1971.

Texas Senator Ted Cruz is an alumnus of Colonial Club from the class of 1992.

Anne Holton, former Virginia Secretary of Education and the wife of U.S. Senator and 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is an alumnus of Colonial Club from the class of 1980.

<doc id="956321" wikidata="Q7719956" url="?curid=956321" title="The Breeze (Yeovil &amp; South Somerset)">
<text>Greatest Hits Radio Somerset (Yeovil) is an Independent Local Radio station serving Yeovil, South Somerset and West Dorset in England.

The station, formerly known as The Breeze (Yeovil and South Somerset), was folded into Greatest Hits Radio South West, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==

The station was originally called Ivel FM. In 2002, the radio station along with YDR FM, Mirage FM and Merlin FM bid for the licence to serve Yeovil. Ivel FM was victorious and commenced broadcasting in October 2003.

In its final 13th year of statutory life (2003), the Radio Authority awarded its 150th analogue radio licence - on this occasion for the South Somerset area of Yeovil. Four applicants entered the running with the winner being RIL Ltd backed by Launch Director James Richards, now owns and runs Approach Motoring School and Approach Driver Academy Ltd, who came up with the name Ivel FM, because it so symbolises the broadcast area. Ilchester (Ivelchester) and Ilminster (Ivelminster) from the Anglo-Saxon heritage. Ivel FM offered a friendly locally involved radio station aimed at the 25-64 age bracket, with coverage of local news and information and conversation on life in the county and area. Musically, popular favourites from four decades.

Amongst the management of Ivel FM, there was ex-Orchard FM&#x27;s Christine Haigh, Yeovil Town&#x27;s Chairman John Fry, local Chartered Accountant Clive Brown and Launch Director James Richards, previously Station Manager of Vale FM in Shaftesbury. In its time, the RA issued what&#x27;s turned out to be an average of 1 new station per month. Ivel FM became operational in October 2003 covering Chard and Ilminster and Sherborne. The launch was deemed to one of the most successful in the RA&#x27;s history.

The station&#x27;s programme controller and breakfast presenter was Steve Carpenter. He has been presenting the Breakfast Show since 2004 and has worked in radio since 1985, previously at DevonAir Radio, Orchard FM, 107.7 WFM and BBC Radio Devon.

Other presenters at the station included Neil Quigley, who is now hosting a programme elsewhere, Dan Gold, David Gale, Tim Ley, Phil Clements and Kevin Hann. Scott Temple and Matt Crabb also joined the line up and continued their shows after the Midwest Radio rebrand.

===First Rebrand===

The station was sold to Midwest Radio Ltd in a deal along with Vale FM.

The owners subsequently rebranded the station, along with Vale FM as Midwest Radio. The old TLRC branding disappeared, and the stations shared a single website at www.midwestradio.co.uk. The two stations constitute a mini-network with off-peak shows being simulcast on both stations. In 2011 all split shows were dropped and all programming originated from the broadcast center in Yeovil. A single breakfast show was launched with split content relevant to the &#x27;Somerset &amp; West Dorset&#x27; (Ivel) and &#x27;North Dorset&#x27; (Vale) broadcast areas. The show was hosted by Steve Carpenter, news and sport was read by Greg Bown and the show was produced by Matt Crabb. Former Orchard FM presenter, Laura Jones replaced Matt Crabb before the station rebranded to The Breeze.

According to RAJAR Midwest Radio reached up to 42,000 adults a month with nearly half a million listening hours.

===The Breeze===

In December 2011, both Midwest Radio Stations were sold to Celador Radio after Midwest Radio Ltd decided not to contest with the Bridgwater licence.

After an approval with Ofcom, both stations have been relaunched as The Breeze at midnight on 25 June 2012, merging with The Breeze in Bridgwater.

<text>Minster FM was an Independent Local Radio station serving York and the surrounding areas such as Selby, Tadcaster, Thirsk, Northallerton and Goole. The station closed on 31 August 2020 and its frequency is now a relay of Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire. It broadcast on 104.7 FM from the Acklam Wold transmitter, near Leavening, on the Yorkshire Wolds.

==History==

Minster FM, named after York Minster, launched at 6am on Saturday 4 July 1992. This was nine years to the day after BBC Radio York had started to broadcast. The first presenter to air was Daragh Corcoran and the first song played was &#x27;Saturday in the Park&#x27; by Chicago. Minster FM launched with a live locally presented schedule 24 hours a day. This continued until the launch of Yorkshire Coast Radio in November 1993 when programmes between 10pm and 6am were broadcast (or networked) on both stations.

In 1996 the station added a transmitter to cover the Thirsk and Northallerton area using a signal on 102.3 FM from Calvert&#x27;s Carpets in Thirsk.
In 2005, station owners The Local Radio Company (TLRC) secured a specific licence for the area and launched Minster Northallerton on that frequency.

TLRC was later taken over by UKRD, and in 2009, the new owners merged this station with its stations based in Darlington and Durham to form Star Radio.

On 17 December 2014, Minster FM started broadcasting on DAB digital radio, under the name More Minster. It is broadcast on the North Yorkshire DAB multiplex from various locations within Yorkshire, including Bilsdale, Acklam Wold, Hildebrand Barracks and Oliver&#x27;s Mount.

More Minster carried Minster FM programmes in the morning and through the day. During the evening, the DAB schedule differed from the FM version, broadcasting its own dedicated programming.

In 2017, UKRD announced that it would give back Star Radio licences to the regulator Ofcom in return for the transfer of the Northallerton licence to Minster FM. This was confirmed on 4 April 2017. 102.3 FM once again began broadcasting Minster FM along with a transmitter covering the Northallerton area on 103.5 FM.

UKRD local radio stations were bought by Bauer Radio in 2019, along with many other local radio stations in England. On 1 September 2020 it became a part of Bauer Radio&#x27;s Greatest Hits radio network with music from the 70s, 80s &amp; 90s – this type of music having been phased in since its takeover.

In January 2021, a number of former presenters and staff from Minster FM launched a new digital radio station for the region, YorkMix Radio.

==Awards==
In 2009, Minster FM was one of three stations to be nominated for The Arqiva Station of the Year (under 300,000 listeners in TSA), but lost out to Lincs FM 102.2.

In 2017, drivetime presenter Harry Whittaker received a nomination for &#x27;Best New Show&#x27; at the UK ARIAS and &#x27;Best Entertainment Programming&#x27; at the 2018 O2 media Awards

In 2019, Minster FM won the &#x27;Charitable Business Award&#x27; at the Yorkshire Choice Awards 2019.

== Programming before rebrand==
The majority of Minster FM&#x27;s programmings were produced and broadcast from its York studios. Live presenter-led programming aired from 4 am to 10 pm on weekdays, 6 am to 8 pm on Saturdays and 6 am to 7 pm on Sundays, with automated non-stop music broadcast overnight. The sole syndicated programme on the station, produced by Salford-based Chris Country Radio, aired on Sunday evenings.

=== News ===
Minster FM broadcast hourly local news bulletins from 6 am to 6 pm on weekdays and from 8 am to 1 pm at weekends. On weekdays, headlines and sports bulletins were broadcast on the half-hour during breakfast and drivetime shows. At all other times, syndicated national bulletins from Sky News Radio were broadcast on the hour.

Originally, Minster FM&#x27;s local news provision had been contracted out to Yorkshire Television&#x27;s regional news service &quot;Calendar&quot;. However, it was later brought in-house.

<doc id="956326" wikidata="Q4931224" url="?curid=956326" title="Boag's Brewery">
<text>Boag&#x27;s Brewery (J. Boag &amp; Son) is an Australian brewery company founded in 1883 by James Boag and his son, also named James, in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia. It is now owned by Lion, a Trans-Tasman subsidiary company of Japanese beverage conglomerate, Kirin. All of the company&#x27;s beers are produced in Launceston.

==History==

===19th century===

James Boag I arrived in Australia with his wife, Janet, and their four children in 1853 from Scotland. After three months in the Victorian goldfields, they came to Tasmania. After he and his son James Boag II left the Cornwall Brewery in 1878, James II went into partnership with John Glenwright at the Cataract Brewery an James I became the licensee of the All Year Round Hotel.

In 1881, the Esk Brewery was established on the banks of the North Esk River in Launceston by Charles Stammers Button. John Fawns died, and James Boag III was born. In 1883, James I and his son took over the Esk Brewery. J. Boag &amp; Son was officially formed in 1883, as the partnership between James Boag I and his son, to operate the brewery. The company&#x27;s initial output was seven hogsheads of beer weekly. The name &#x27;Esk Brewery&#x27; was retained, although &#x27;Boag&#x27;s Brewery&#x27; became a frequent reference.

In 1887, James Boag II began management of the company on the retirement of his father. A new malthouse was built and weekly production had increased to more than 500 hogsheads, with the brewery employing a 30 members of staff.

In 1898, J. Boag &amp; Son purchased the Cornwall Brewery and amalgamated it with the Esk Brewery; James Boag I died in 1890.

===20th century===
James Boag II died in 1919 and was succeeded by James Boag III who had been training at Tooth and Co.&#x27;s brewery in Sydney.

In 1924, James Boag III retired temporarily from the company, and returned in 1930 as Managing Director, a position he held until his death in 1944. His obituary in the Examiner reported: &quot;Having been closely connected with business and sporting activities, Mr Boag was known and respected by a wide circle of friends. At the time of his death, he was Managing Director of J. Boag &amp; Son Limited and a Director of Tasmanian Breweries Pty Limited.&quot;

George Boag, James III&#x27;s second son, took over James&#x27; seat on the Board; he was the last Boag working in the business, retiring in 1976 after the death of his wife.

===Since 2000===

In 2000, San Miguel Corporation acquired J. Boag &amp; Son (previously a publicly listed company) for $92 million. The existing Tasmanian management was retained to continue running the company; production had increased annually for the previous 3 years and this growth was planned to continue.

In 2004, Boag&#x27;s Brewery was expanded to occupy the complete block enclosed by William, Tamar and Shield Streets and The Esplanade.

San Miguel sold J. Boag &amp; Son to Lion Nathan Ltd in November 2007 for $325 million.

As of 2010 J. Boag and Son employed over 150 people and produced over of beer annually.

==James Boag Brewery Experience==
Opening in 1826 and originally named The Lame Dog Hotel; the building would go on to be known as The Golden Lion, The Prince Albert, The Prince Alfred, and finally The Tamar Hotel. The building was bought buy The James Boag Brewery in the late 1990s; and restored to house the James Boag Brewery Experience (previously Boags Centre for Beer Lovers); from which the James Boag Brewery run daily tours, 7 days a week; as well as running a function centre, cafe, and beer garden.

<doc id="956329" wikidata="Q1251087" url="?curid=956329" title="Puerto Williams">
<text>Puerto Williams (; Spanish for &quot;Port Williams&quot;) is a city, port and naval base on Navarino Island in Chile. It faces the Beagle Channel. It is the capital of the Chilean Antarctic Province, one of four provinces in the Magellan and Chilean Antarctica Region, and administers the communes of Chilean Antarctic Territory and Cabo de Hornos. It has a population of 2,874, including both naval personnel and civilians. Puerto Williams claims the title of world&#x27;s southernmost city.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.infinito-sur.com&quot;&gt;http://www.infinito-sur.com/ , retrieved 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The settlement was founded in 1953, and was first named &quot;Puerto Luisa.&quot; The town was later named after John Williams Wilson, a British man who founded Fuerte Bulnes, the first settlement in the Strait of Magellan. It has served primarily as a naval base for Chile. The Chilean Navy runs the Guardiamarina Zañartu Airport and hospital, as well as nearby meteorological stations. Since the late 20th century, the number of navy personnel has decreased in Puerto Williams and the civilian population has increased. In that period, tourism and support of scientific research have contributed to an increase in economic activity.

The port attracts tourists going to Cape Horn or Antarctica; its tourism industry developed around the concept of &quot;the world&#x27;s southernmost city&quot;. Based on some definitions of what constitutes a city, Puerto Williams could in fact be the southernmost city in the world. However, others dispute this because of the small settlement size and population in favor of Ushuaia or Punta Arenas. Chilean and Argentine media, a bilateral agreement between Chile and Argentina, and the Puerto Williams administration identify it as the southernmost city in the world.

Puerto Williams is the port of entry and major hub for scientific activity linked to Antarctica and the islands south of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. The University of Magallanes has a university center in Puerto Williams. Weather stations and lighthouses at Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands are supplied from Puerto Williams. The town has been a base for Chile to assert sovereignty around Cape Horn and support its Antarctic bases.

Puerto Williams also serves as a provision and service center for fishermen. The Navy is based here in part to enforce national fishing rights in the exclusive economic zone around the southern part of Tierra del Fuego, where lucrative &quot;Lithodes santolla&quot; fishing is an important industry.

==History==

The Yahgan people, indigenous to southern Chile, are believed to have migrated to this area more than 10,000 years ago and established their traditional hunter-gatherer culture. Europeans first came across them and the area in the early sixteenth century. It was not until the 19th century that Europeans began to be interested in the area for development; its towns had sometimes supplied whaling ships.

At the end of the 19th century, gold was discovered in the region, attracting masses of migrants and immigrants seeking fortunes. By 1890 there were approximately 300 goldminers in the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands and Puerto Toro which was founded in 1892. Puerto Navarino, on the west side of the Navarino island, was founded in June 1938. In addition, some of the islands were developed to support sheep ranching, and meat and wool exports became important.

Puerto Williams was founded 1953, developed primarily as a naval base for Chile. Its naval hospital of 463 m2 (today 638 m2) opened in 1960. In 2002 the electrical power supply was transferred from the Chilean Navy to a private provider.

According to the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina, Puerto Williams is the start point for vessels of all nations in traffic between the Straits of Magellan and Argentine ports in the Beagle Channel.

==Demography==

Between 1982 and 2002, the population of Puerto Williams grew from 1,059 to 2,874. Since 1982, Puerto Williams has been classified as an urban entity by Chile&#x27;s National Statistics Institute (&quot;INE&quot;), although the department generally classifies a city as an urban entity with more than 5,000 residents.

==Local celebrations==
&quot;Glorias Navales Regata&quot;: In the last week of May, the city holds a sailing competition attracting international participants. The competition is on its 7th season and has more than 300 participants every year. The journey starts from the city&#x27;s port and takes the fjords route. The regatta is part of the Chilean Navy&#x27;s &quot;Month of the Sea&quot; activities that commemorate the Naval Battle of Iquique in 1879.

&quot;Fiesta de la nieve&quot; (&quot;Snow Festival&quot;): Celebrating the winter season in July, the city celebrates the winter with snow games, cars and rodeos, in a celebration that lasts 6 days.

==Climate==

The climate of Puerto Williams is a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) bordering closely on a tundra climate (&quot;ET&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. The summers are short and cool while the winters are long, wet, but moderate. Rainfall is around a year and temperatures are steady throughout the year. Snowfall can occur in summer. The cold and wet summers help preserve glaciers. Although the area around the town is well-forested, exposed areas at some distance from or altitude above it have a sub-Antarctic climate typical of tundra, which makes the growth of trees impossible. 

==Tourism==
Tourism is one of the main economic activities of Puerto Williams. Most lodgings for tourists are hostels. Several trails for multi-day hikes and back-packing trips have been developed in the Dientes de Navarino mountains south of Puerto Williams. A five-day hiking circuit passes around the jagged pinnacles known as the Dientes de Navarino. The trail passes peaks known as Cerro Clem and Montes Lindenmayer, named in 2001 by the Chilean Ministry of Natural Resources for the author of the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; guide.

Remains of Yahgan Indian campsites and fishtraps can be found along the coast east of the city. Puerto Williams is home to the Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum, which depicts the lives of both the Yahgan (or Yámana) and Selk&#x27;nam peoples, who were indigenous to Tierra del Fuego. For easy exploration of some of the subantarctic forest, the Omora Ethnobotanical Park is five kilometres down the road to the west.
==Transport==
Access is by daily air service from Guardiamarina Zañartu Airport provided by Aerovías DAP or by the weekly vehicle ferry, &quot;Yaghan,&quot; from Punta Arenas, to the north. There is no formal public transport service, but an expensive transfer is possible using smaller boats to Ushuaia on the main island of Tierra del Fuego, in Argentina.

==Naval base==

Puerto Williams is one of the principal naval bases of the Chilean Navy. The base is used as start point for patrol, reconnaissance missions, and rescues in the areas of Beagle Channel, Cape Horn, Drake Passage and the Antarctic Peninsula. The Chilean Navy operates Guardia Marina Zañartu Airport and the Naval Hospital of Puerto Williams in Puerto Williams. Navy personnel make up a considerable portion of the population, although their numbers have decreased in the 21st century.

The following patrol boats and ships are stationed at Puerto Williams:
* PSG &quot;Sibbald&quot;
* PSG &quot;Isaza&quot;
* LSG &quot;Hallef&quot;
* LSG &quot;Alacalufe&quot;
* PM &quot;Puerto Williams&quot;

The bow section of the &quot;Yelcho&quot;, the tug used by Luis Pardo on 30 August 1916 to rescue Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s men stranded on Elephant Island, has been installed at the front of the Naval headquarters.

==Services and facilities==
The city has a branch of Banco de Chile, and supports a fire station, and a police station of the Carabineros de Chile. Children are educated at a kindergarten, and primary and secondary schools, and a university center of the University of Magallanes. The Martin Gusinde Anthropological Museum, an airport, seaport, and Micalvi Yacht Club are attractions.

Puerto Williams is served by Radio Navarino.

==Administration==

Puerto Williams is administered by a municipal council, headed by a mayor who is directly elected every four years. Since 2016 the mayor is Jaime Fernández Alarcón (DC). The communal council has the following members:

Daniel Fernando Valdebenito Contreras (PS)
Ángela Barría Barrientos (RN)
Juan Velásquez (PS)
Carolina Guenel González (DC)
Francis Delgado Ibaceta (RN)
Paola Speake Ojeda (DC)

<text>Greatest Hits Radio Bucks, Beds and Herts (formerly Mix 96) is an Independent Local Radio station, owned and operated by Bauer, which broadcasts to Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire. It is part of the Greatest Hits Radio network.

It was formerly known as Mix 96 prior to a rebrand by Bauer in 2020.

== History ==

Mix 96 launched on 15 April 1994 broadcasting on 96.2FM, it was the first radio station to gain a permanent licence to serve Aylesbury and the surrounding towns including Thame, Princes Risborough, Tring and Leighton Buzzard. The launch slogan was &#x27;Bucks Best Music&#x27; but the station now uses the strapline &quot;Bucks Best Mix of Music&quot;. The first song to be played on the radio station was &#x27;Dancing Queen&#x27; by ABBA, played at 7:45am on the opening morning, 15 April 1994.

Originally an independent, it was solely owned by local group Bucks Broadcasting Ltd. The original Chairman of Mix 96 was Richard Morris-Adams, Managing Director was Mark Flanagan, Sales Director was Erika Sorby-Firth and the Programme Controller was Keri Jones. In 1995, Erika Sorby-Firth took on the role of MD until Bucks Broadcasting was divested to Radio Investments in 2001. The current Managing Director is Max Hailey who returned to the radio station in 2013.

The group invested in a number of stations throughout the UK including The Bear 102, in Stratford-upon-Avon, 107.7 The Wolf in Wolverhampton, Arrow FM in Hastings and Surf 107 in Brighton.

Fox FM increased their shareholding in Bucks Broadcasting, and were themselves wholly acquired by Capital Radio plc, leading the company to become part of Capital until they were divested to Radio Investments (later known as The Local Radio Company).

The latest audience listening figures show that Mix 96 has a weekly reach of 34% (42,800).

It celebrated its 20th birthday on 15 April 2014.

On 27 May 2020 it was announced that Mix 96 would be closed and rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio from early September 2020.

A Facebook group and online petition to save Mix 96 was created by loyal listeners which even got raised as a talking point in the Houses Of Parliament.

On 1 February 2021 the previous presenters formed a new online radio station Bucks Radio which reverted to the previous mix of old and new songs with local news, weather and travel. Bucks Radio launched on DAB across the county in June 2024

== Present format ==
Its playlist is a now a syndicated feed from Greatest Hits Radio playing music from the 70&#x27;s, 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. The previous format of Mix 96 had played a mixture of old classics and new music.

<text>Cheshire&#x27;s Silk Radio is an Independent Local Radio serving Macclesfield and parts of East Cheshire, owned and operated by neighbouring station Chester&#x27;s Dee Radio.

It broadcasts a mix of current and classic hits alongside local news and sport.

As of March 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 7,000, according to RAJAR.

== History ==
Silk FM launched on 25 May 1998 with special guest Sammy McIlroy, then manager of Macclesfield Town Football Club. Past presenters have included Nick Wright, Jeff Cooper, Guy Morris, Paul Allen and Trevor Thomas.

The station was previously owned by The Local Radio Company before being sold to the owners of Dee 106.3 in June 2009. In January 2017 the station moved into a new studio complex at Adelaide House, Adelaide Street in Macclesfield.

In November 2012, the station was granted a significant transmitter power increase, partly to combat co-channel interference from the Heart North and Mid Wales transmitter at the Moel-y-Parc transmitting station, also broadcasting on 106.9 MHz FM. The transmitter site at Sutton Common BT Tower offers a line of sight across the Cheshire plain, meaning the signal can be heard into Lancashire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside.

On 25 May 2023, the station celebrated its 25th anniversary by launching on DAB on the South Cheshire Multiplex. With the transmitter being located on the roof of South Cheshire College

==Community==
The station awards the title School of the Week to schools within its broadcast area. Perhaps the most important awards it gives are the &quot;Local Hero awards&quot; which have been awarded since the stations inception.

The annual Cheshire Show is one of the highlights in the Silk calendar, of which the station offers extensive coverage.

==Awards==
In 2008, having been short-listed for the award in the previous year, Silk won Radio Station of the Year (under 300,000) at the Sony Radio Awards. It was again short-listed for the 2009 award.

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, Silk was named Radio Academy North West Station of the Year.

==Programming==
Some of Silk Radio&#x27;s programming is produced and broadcast from its Macclesfield studios. Live programming airs from 6am-7pm on weekdays, 8am-6pm on Saturdays and 8am-8pm on Sundays. Other output is automated or networked from Riverside Innovation Centre in Chester - Chester&#x27;s Dee Radio.

Silk Radio broadcasts hourly local, and national news bulletins from Radio News Hub.

The station also airs weekly sports programming and Saturday afternoons, including regular coverage of Macclesfield FC and Congleton Town.

<text>More Radio Eastbourne, formerly Sovereign FM, is an Independent Local Radio station serving Eastbourne, Hailsham, Polegate and surrounding areas. It is owned and operated by Total Sense Media and broadcasts from studios in Burgess Hill, as part of a network of stations across Sussex.

==History==
A completely unrelated &#x27;temporary&#x27; radio station &quot;Sovereign Radio&quot; was founded in Eastbourne in 1992 by local radio enthusiasts Mark Briggs and Matthew Wheeler, who established RSL trial broadcasts in December 1992 and the summer of 1993. The second RSL was based on board an old ferry from the Shetland Islands called the Earl of Zetland, which was temporarily moored in Sovereign Harbour. Some of the station&#x27;s original presenters included Gavin Lawrence, Paul Martin, Terry James and Zora Suleman.
The broadcasts were part of a campaign to demonstrate viability to the Radio Authority (a legacy regulator now part of Ofcom) to advertise a full licence.

The full licence for the Eastbourne and Hailsham area was eventually awarded in 1994 to another, unconnected, group which later included several members of the team from the previous temporary station.

Sovereign Radio (later 107.5 Sovereign FM) began broadcasting in 1997 from studios at St Mary&#x27;s Walk in Hailsham.

The station was later acquired by The Local Radio Company in 2000 and for a year, was once again managed by co-founder of the original (1992) RSL station Mark Briggs, who also managed neighbouring sister stations Arrow FM in Hastings and Neptune Radio (now KMFM in Dover and Folkestone).

Media Sound Holdings acquired the station from The Local Radio Company in June 2009 along with Hastings-based Arrow FM, with both stations were operating at a loss. The group already owned Splash FM and Bright FM which were acquired in April 2008.

In November 2010, Ofcom approved Media Sound Holdings&#x27;s application to share all programmes across their four stations Arrow FM, Bright FM, Sovereign FM and Splash FM, given that the stations &quot;already share all programming outside of breakfast, so these changes will not substantially alter the character of the service.&quot;

On 11 April 2016, Sovereign FM changed its name to More Radio.

==Programming==
All programming on the station is produced from Total Sense Media&#x27;s Worthing studios and shared with More Radio Eastbourne, More Radio Mid-Sussex and More Radio Worthing with opt-outs for local news and advertising.

Local news airs every hour from 6am to 6pm on weekdays and from 8am to 12pm on Saturdays with headlines on the half hour during weekday breakfast and drivetime shows. National news bulletins from Sky News Radio are carried hourly at all other times.

<doc id="956334" wikidata="Q5358450" url="?curid=956334" title="Electronic voting in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Electronic voting machines for elections in Ireland were used on a trial basis in 2002, but plans to extend it to all polling stations were put on hold in 2004 after public opposition and political controversy. Electoral law was amended in 2001 and 2004 and sufficient voting machines for the entire state were purchased, but the plan was officially dropped in 2009 and the machines were subsequently scrapped. Elections continue to use paper ballots completed in pencil.

==Background==
At the 17 May 2002 general election, electronic voting machines were used in three of 42 constituencies (Dublin North, Dublin West and Meath) on a trial basis, with the intention that it would be extended to the whole country for future elections. For the 19 October 2002 referendum on the Treaty of Nice, machines were used in seven constituencies (the previous three plus Dublin Mid-West, Dublin South, Dublin South-West and Dún Laoghaire) covering 18% of the electorate.

A confidential report in 2002 expressed serious concern over the security of the voting machines. According to the report, the integrity of the ballot could not be guaranteed with the equipment and controls used. The Department of the Environment disagreed with many of these findings, saying the machines were secure and that the presence of voting officials prevents tampering. Socialist Party TD Joe Higgins said electronic voting should be abandoned, and he claimed, a lack of transparency and the new system could be open to &quot;radical manipulation.&quot;

==Proposed implementation ==
Following the 2002 trial of the machines, in 2004 the government undertook plans to introduce a nationwide electronic voting system for the local and European Parliament elections. The proposed change was under the supervision of then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Martin Cullen.

In March 2004 the Government of Ireland established the Independent Commission on Electronic Voting and Counting at Elections to examine the proposed system. It was dissolved in 2006. The Commission issued a series of reports reviewing the proposed system and comparing it to the existing electoral system:

&quot;The Commission can recommend the voting and counting equipment as follows:
*The voting machine and related hardware components are of good quality and their design, which is based on voting systems that have been reliable in use elsewhere for some years, has also remained stable since their adaptation for use in Ireland. Subject to some minor security and usability enhancements, followed by extended and rigorous testing once they have been so modified, the voting machine and related components can be confidently recommended for use.
*The embedded software of the voting machine is also of adequate quality, requiring only minor modifications followed by further analysis to confirm its reliability.&quot;
==Scrapping of project==
The prime issue was the lack of verifiability by the absence of an audit mechanism or verified paper trail. The former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern had defended the flawed system in the Dáil, bemoaning the use of &quot;stupid old pencils&quot;.

The voting machines bought by the government from Dutch firm Nedap were kept in storage as the cabinet pondered what to do after the Commission on Electronic Voting said it could not recommend the system. Approximately €0.5m was spent improving the software. Ahern defended the system despite public scepticism and opposition from within his own party on the basis that having spent the money, it would cause loss of national pride if the system were scrapped.

In October 2006, a group of Dutch hackers, including Rop Gonggrijp, showed how similar machines to the ones purchased in Ireland could be modified by replacing the EEPROMs with Nedap -Firmware with EEPROMs with their own firmware.

On 23 April 2009, Minister for the Environment John Gormley announced that the electronic voting system was to be scrapped, due to cost and the public&#x27;s dissatisfaction with it.

A Department of the Environment website demonstrating how to use electronic voting machines was live until 2012.

On 6 October 2010, the Taoiseach Brian Cowen said that the 7,000 machines would not be used for voting and would be disposed of. By that date, the total cost of the electronic voting project has reached €54.6 million, including €3 million spent on storing the machines over the previous five years.

In 2012, KMK Metals Recycling paid €70,267 for 7,500 e-voting machines; 1,232 transport/storage trolleys; 2,142 hand trolleys and 4,787 metal tilt tables.

==Later discussions==
In 2018, John Paul Phelan, the Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government responded to a Dáil question from Shane Cassells about online voting. Phelan said there were &quot;no proposals to introduce measures to support online voting or to re-introduce e-voting&quot;; he had an &quot;open mind&quot; on online voting, but there were other electoral changes which would take priority, including online access to the electoral register and the introduction of an Electoral Commission.

Later in 2018, Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan told reporters that there is no question of the pencil and the ballot paper being removed from the Irish election process.

<text>Spire FM was an Independent Local Radio station based in Salisbury, Wiltshire. It was awarded the licence to broadcast to Salisbury and the surrounding areas by the Radio Authority, now Ofcom, in 1991. The station took its name from the spire of Salisbury Cathedral.

After several changes of ownership, it was rolled up into Greatest Hits Radio in September 2020, ceasing local programming.

==History==
The station was fully launched on 20 September 1992 (the licence ran from the 5th, when test transmissions began to include programmes about the Salisbury Arts Festival). Spire FM broadcast from City Hall Studios in Malthouse Lane, Salisbury, part of the City Hall entertainment venue.

Originally independently owned, it was acquired by Radio Investments Limited in 1995, and from 1996 the station was owned by The Local Radio Company, which was a joint venture with GWR Group until it was converted into an AIM-quoted company in 2004. TLRC was acquired by UKRD Group in 2009, and Bauer Radio bought UKRD&#x27;s ten stations in 2019.

Spire FM won a prestigious Sony Radio Award for Station of the Year in 1994 and the runner-up award in 2003. Other awards included the KPMG Marketing Excellence Award, and Wiltshire Business of the Year finalists.

Bauer Media rebranded the station as Greatest Hits Radio Salisbury in September 2020, as part of their national Greatest Hits Radio network. It now broadcasts national and regional music programmes with local news bulletins. 

In January 2024, Bauer dropped local news bulletins for Salisbury - determining these to sound &quot;jarring and parochial&quot; alongside networked programming - and instead transmitted bulletins shared with the (then digital-only, prior to the April flip of Wave 105) South Hampshire iteration of GHR. Salisbury-specific bulletins on weekdays were reinstated in March 2024. Ofcom considered that a complaint about the lack of local news material had been resolved by their reintroduction.

==Programming==
All programming on the station was locally produced. Until 2018, Spire FM broadcast The Vodafone Big Top 40 chart show (previously The Pepsi Chart and Hit40UK) which was produced from Capital FM in London and syndicated across over 140 commercial radio stations in the UK. However, the show was withdrawn from syndication in 2018 and now broadcasts solely on Heart and Capital stations.

<doc id="956336" wikidata="Q3194728" url="?curid=956336" title="Keith Bostic (software engineer)">
<text>Keith Bostic (born July 26, 1959) is an American software engineer and one of the key people in the history of Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix and open-source software.

==Biography==
In 1986, Bostic joined the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley. He was one of the principal architects of the Berkeley 2BSD, 4.4BSD and 4.4BSD-Lite releases. Among many other tasks, he led the effort at CSRG to create a free software version of BSD Unix, which helped allow the creation of FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.

Bostic was a founder of Berkeley Software Design Inc. (BSDi), which produced BSD/OS, a proprietary version of BSD.

In 1993, the USENIX Association gave a Lifetime Achievement Award (&quot;Flame&quot;) to the Computer Systems Research Group, honoring 180 individuals, including Bostic, who contributed to the group&#x27;s 4.4BSD-Lite release.

Bostic and his wife Margo Seltzer founded Sleepycat Software in 1996 to develop and commercialize Berkeley DB, an open-source, key-value database. Sleepycat Software was the first company to develop dual-licensed open-source software. In February 2006, the company was acquired by Oracle Corporation, where Bostic worked until 2008.

Bostic and Michael Cahill founded WiredTiger in 2010 to create a NoSQL database management system. In November 2014, the company was acquired by MongoDB, which employed Bostic.

Bostic is the author of nvi—a re-implementation of the classic text editor vi—and many other standard BSD and Linux utilities. He is a past member of the Association for Computing Machinery, IEEE, and several POSIX working groups, and a contributor to POSIX standards.

<doc id="956338" wikidata="Q644381" url="?curid=956338" title="Eddie Kramer">
<text>Edwin H. Kramer (born 19 April 1942) is a South African-born recording producer and engineer. He has collaborated with several artists now in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, including Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the Kinks, Kiss, John Mellencamp, GRODD and Carlos Santana, as well as records for other well-known artists in various genres.

Kramer&#x27;s film soundtrack credits include &quot;Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight&quot;, &quot;Festival Express&quot;, &quot;Jimi Plays Monterey&quot;, &quot;Jimi Plays Berkeley&quot;, &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;, &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;, &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Bridge&quot;, &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.
Kramer was interviewed extensively in &quot;Jimi Hendrix: Hear My Train a Comin&quot;&#x27;, a two-hour American Masters documentary which debuted in November 2013.

He is also a photographer who has exhibited a number of his intimate images of performers, particularly Hendrix, with whom he worked on &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;, &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;, and &quot;The Cry of Love&quot;, as well as the posthumous &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;, &quot;People, Hell and Angels&quot;, &quot;Miami Pop Festival&quot;, and other releases produced through Experience Hendrix, the organization formed by Hendrix&#x27;s heirs.

== Early life ==
Kramer was born in Cape Town to art and music-loving parents Sonny and Minna Kramer, active opponents of apartheid who moved from South Africa to London in the early 1960s for political reasons. At age four he began studying the piano. That instrument remained his first love, but he also dabbled with the violin and the cello. He studied classical piano at the South African College of Music. During these studies he became fascinated with jazz and rock, much to his father&#x27;s chagrin.
Kramer moved to London at age 19, some six months after his parents&#x27; relocating there. There he recorded jazz groups in a home studio with primitive recording equipment, installed hi-fi equipment in antique furniture, and installed album playback systems for the Soho Record Centre, the preeminent London record store chain of the day.

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
Kramer got his first industry job in 1962 at Advision Studios. A year later he was hired by Pye Studios, where he assisted on mobile recordings of classical works. He also assisted on Pye Studios recordings by the Kinks, the Searchers, the Undertakers, Petula Clark, and Sammy Davis Jr.
In 1964 he founded KPS Studios, a mono- and two-track facility which was acquired in 1965 by Regent Sound, where the Rolling Stones had recorded their first album. Regent then tasked Kramer to help build and run their new four-track studio. The Beatles had recorded &quot;Fixing a Hole&quot; there, later to be featured on their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Kramer engineered two Beatles hit singles which appeared on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;—&quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; and &quot;Baby You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot;. The two songs were recorded at Olympic Studios, where, in 1967, Kramer engineered albums for the Rolling Stones, Small Faces, Traffic, and Jimi Hendrix. Kramer became a permanent part of Hendrix&#x27;s creative process, collaborating on the four albums which Hendrix released before his death in 1970.

In 1968 Kramer relocated to New York, primarily to continue working with Hendrix. Headquartered first at The Record Plant and later working as an independent producer and engineer, Kramer produced the first Johnny Winter album and engineered a sequence of five Led Zeppelin albums, beginning with Led Zeppelin II.

Kramer and his crew engineered the sound at the 1969 Woodstock Festival; they recorded the entire festival in a harried, sleepless, three-day binge, using vitamin B shots for stamina. The brilliant performances from several of rock&#x27;s then-reigning acts are documented in both the film, &quot;Woodstock&quot;, and the three-disc album &quot;&quot;.

=== 1970s ===
Kramer began the second decade of his career working alongside architect John Storyk to oversee creation of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s state-of-the-art studio, Electric Lady Studios, built and equipped for a then-astonishing $1 million. He served as Director of Engineering there from 1970 to 1974, producing Carly Simon&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Carly Simon&quot;, as well as albums for Sha Na Na and Peter Frampton, and also engineering albums for Lena Horne, Dionne Warwick, and David Bowie, &quot;David Live&quot; and &quot;Young Americans&quot;. (The latter featured rhythm guitar from John Lennon on its Number One hit, &quot;Fame&quot;.)

In 1971 he mixed Humble Pie&#x27;s double album &quot;Performance Rockin&#x27; the Fillmore&quot;, featuring Steve Marriott and Peter Frampton, still Larry Corryell&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Boy&quot;, his first and only album for Flying Dutchman label, and Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s double album &quot;Curtis/Live!&quot;, his first release after leaving The Impressions.
In 1973 Kramer mixed Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot;. In the same year he began a lengthy association with Kiss. Earlier he had produced a four-song demo that won their first recording contract. He eventually produced &quot;Alive!&quot;, &quot;Alive II&quot;, &quot;Double Platinum&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot;, &quot;Love Gun&quot;, &quot;Alive III&quot; as well as member Ace Frehley&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Ace Frehley&quot;, which yielded a hit single, &quot;New York Groove&quot;. Also in 1973 he engineered the live Derek and the Dominos album &quot;In Concert&quot;. Also released in 1973 was the debut album by Jobriath. The following year saw the release of Jobriath&#x27;s sophomore (and final) album, Creatures Of The Street, also co-produced by Kramer.

Kramer left Electric Lady Studios in 1975. Working independently, he engineered the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Love You Live&quot;, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; and &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, and Peter Frampton&#x27;s &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot;, the biggest-selling album of 1976, a 2-disc release that sold over 14 million units. In the same year he mixed Bad Company&#x27;s third album, &quot;Run with the Pack&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Kramer produced Buddy Guy, classical guitarist John Williams, award-winning country group the Kentucky Headhunters, hard rock and metal bands such as Whitesnake, Icon, Pretty Maids, Fastway, Alcatrazz featuring Steve Vai and Graham Bonnet, and Anthrax. He produced &quot;Among the Living&quot; for Anthrax in 1987, which yielded a Top 10 single in the UK, &quot;I Am the Law&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
September 1992 saw the publication of a book co-authored by Kramer and John McDermott. &quot;Hendrix: Setting the Record Straight&quot; was built on Kramer&#x27;s years of collaboration with Hendrix, augmented by fresh interviews with key musicians and other participants in the meteoric Hendrix career.

In 1993 Kramer produced and engineered &quot;Stone Free: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix&quot;, featuring tracks by Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, The Cure, Buddy Guy, classical violinist Nigel Kennedy, Living Colour, jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, hip hop artists P.M. Dawn, Spin Doctors, and others. The album raised $750,000 for music and dance scholarships (Berklee College of Music, the Juilliard School, and Dance Theatre of Harlem), administered by the United Negro College Fund.

In 1994 Kramer released a two-part video series, &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot;, utilizing interviews with Les Paul, the seminal guitarist as well as pioneer of both electric guitar development and modern recording techniques such as multi-tracking and looping. In the same year Kramer produced the Spin Doctors&#x27; single for Woodstock &#x27;94, as well as Buddy Guy&#x27;s Slippin&#x27; In the 1995 Grammy winner for Best Blues Album and winner of the W.C. Handy Award for Album of the Year in 1996. Buddy Guy and the Saturday Nite Live Band with G.E. Smith, also produced by Kramer, was a 1996 Grammy nominee.

At the time of his death, Jimi Hendrix had a considerable backlog of material recorded in anticipation of future album releases. In a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which concluded in 1995, the heirs of Jimi Hendrix won back the rights to his voluminous recordings. Since then, Kramer has served as co-producer of all Hendrix releases.

Kramer produced a second Hendrix tribute album in 1995, &quot;In From the Storm&quot;. Its diverse artists&#x27; roster included the London Metropolitan Orchestra, Toots Thielemans, Carlos Santana, Robben Ford, Taj Mahal, Sting, Steve Vai, Buddy Miles, Brian May, and Bootsy Collins. In 1997 he produced&quot; Now&quot;, the third Paul Rogers studio album.
He won a 1999 Grammy award for his audio production on the video for Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s live album &quot;Band of Gypsys&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
Kramer collected another Grammy in 2002 for engineering a single entitled &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, with Carlos Santana and vocal by Michelle Branch. The track also won a Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

In 2003, Kramer mixed and produced the music soundtrack for the rock music documentary film &quot;Festival Express&quot;, featuring the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, The Band, Buddy Guy, Flying Burrito Brothers, and others.

In 2004, Kramer had several Hendrix-related projects, including helping DigiTech design and create an effects pedal which emulates characteristically Hendrixian guitar sounds. He also remastered Hendrix albums for Classic Vinyl, and remixed Woodstock, a posthumous live release, in 5.1 surround sound.
Concerning his remastering work, Kramer told Guitar Player magazine, &quot;I was able to really enhance and improve upon the actual sound, so if the original sound was good I was able to make it even better. I gave it a more full-bodied sound. I was able to improve some of the dynamics. Of course this is made possible by new technologies and equipment.&quot; Kramer specifically credited modern monitors, which provide abundant high-end detail, making it clear where various instruments are within the stereo image.

In 2005 Kramer reunited with architect John Storyk to design Anacapa Studios in Malibu, California. In the same year, Kramer remastered the Woodstock video footage of Jimi Hendrix for DVD release, revealing a fuller perspective of the guitarist&#x27;s performance.

Again working with Digitech, Kramer helped design and create a Brian May guitar effects pedal in 2006. Also that year, galleries in Santa Monica, California, Hollywood, and Rotterdam exhibited Kramer&#x27;s photographs of rock stars performing, recording, and in candid moments.

Gallery photographic exhibitions in 2007 included Santa Fe, New Mexico and Beverly Hills, California. Kramer also remixed &quot;Evil Ways&quot;, a previously unreleased live Santana track from Woodstock, in 2007, for the 40th anniversary of Woodstock.

In 2008 Kramer mixed tracks for the Jimi Hendrix avatar (a character that a game player can use as an alter ego) Activision&#x27;s Guitar Hero. He also engineered and mixed a 2008 album with Joey Santiago and Dave Lovering of the Pixies.

Kramer again exhibited photos in 2009, at the Morrison Hotel Gallery in Manhattan, as well as a newly opened branch Morrison Hotel Gallery in Del Mar, California. He was filmed and interviewed in 2009 for a BBC documentary about Sir George Martin, producer of all but one of the Beatles&#x27; album releases. In that same year he remixed the posthumously-released &quot;Band of Gypsys Live at the Fillmore East&quot;, along with albums by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Santana, and Crosby, Stills and Nash.

Waves Audio, a producer of software for audio engineers, released the Eddie Kramer Collection in 2009, a set of five plug-ins for replicating Kramer&#x27;s studio touch in recording guitar, drums, vocals, bass, and special effects.

=== 2010s–present ===
A 2010 exhibit at San Francisco Art Exchange displayed Kramer&#x27;s photos of Hendrix and other rock luminaries. In 2010 he also remixed &quot;Cheap Sunglasses&quot;, a re-make of a ZZ Top single by the Australian hard rock band Wolfmother, and in conjunction with John McDermott and the Hendrix family&#x27;s organization, Experience Hendrix, Kramer prepared &quot;Valleys of Neptune&quot;, an album of previously-unreleased Hendrix performances.

Kramer was chosen to be a presenter at the 2011 Grammy Technical Awards. Also in 2011 he recorded preeminent pedal steel blues/gospel guitarist Robert Randolph and the Family Band on the album &quot;Lickety Split&quot;, and Carlos Santana, a guest star on two of the album&#x27;s tracks, as well as completing further mixes of Hendrix recordings in 5.1 Surround Sound. 2011 also saw the release of three more Kramer plug-ins for Wave, Kramer Master Tape, the Kramer HLS Channel, and the Kramer Pie Compressor.

In 2012 he did further sessions with Randolph, and Buddy Guy, and produced and engineered tracks for Acoustic Generations, a Hendrix tribute album featuring contemporary acoustic remakes of Hendrix songs. The project includes contributions from Brandi Carlile, Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready, Jason Mraz, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Billy Gibbons, Rafael Saadiq, Heart, and Crosby and Nash.

Kramer&#x27;s activities in 2013 included introducing three Eddie Kramer Signature guitar effects pedals from F-Pedals, with partner Francesco Sondelli at the NAMM Show, and also consulting with former Doors guitarist Robby Krieger on a new recording studio. Kramer also worked again with Robert Randolph in recording a &quot;sacred steel&quot; band for a 2013 release called Robert Randolph Presents: The Slide Brothers.
5 March 2013 was the release date of &quot;People, Hell and Angels&quot;, a collection of 12 songs which Jimi Hendrix had planned for his follow-up to Electric Ladyland, recorded in 1968–69, following the breakup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. The backing musicians include Buddy Miles and Billy Cox, later to become Hendrix&#x27;s Band of Gypsies, and Stephen Stills on bass.
&quot;Somewhere&quot;, a single released from the album, reached Number One on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales Chart. November 2013 saw the release of the Hendrix documentary Hear My Train A Comin&#x27;, and another Hendrix live album, Miami Pop Festival.

Continuing his involvement with cutting-edge technologies, Kramer is working with Digital Theatre Systems (DTS) in the development of Headphone: X, an app which replicates 5.1, 7.1, and 11.1 Surround Sound in any type of headphone.

=== Significant collaborations ===

==== Jimi Hendrix ====
Kramer specifically cites Hendrix&#x27;s strong individuality, powerful message, and expansion of the sonic vocabulary of electric guitar, including its potentials for controlled feedback and distortion. 

Kramer recalls Hendrix as extremely disciplined in the studio, with his objectives thoroughly pre-planned. To some extent this was a result of working with results-oriented manager and early producer Chas Chandler, who brought Hendrix to England in September 1966, where he established his fame before returning to the United States. Hendrix envisioned the tonal spectrum as a palette of colors, often instructing Kramer with color-based commands. &quot;Make it sound green,&quot; for example, was satisfied by adding reverb.

&quot;Jimi utilized the studio as a rehearsal space, thank God he did.&quot; Kramer described Hendrix as &quot;very sharp, very focused, very funny, very shy, totally dedicated to his music and his art. He was such a complete human being with such far-reaching intellect.&quot;

Kramer places Hendrix among Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Louis Armstrong. &quot;He really is in that league, because his individuality was so strong and his message was so strong and his mastery of his instrument was so complete. He was a maverick. He broke a lot of barriers, musically and in every way.&quot;

==== Led Zeppelin ====
&quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; was the first of five albums which Kramer engineered for Led Zeppelin. It was mixed in a two-day marathon session. While working on the track &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot;, Kramer hit a spot where part of a previously-recorded vocal track kept bleeding through, in which a screaming Robert Plant intones &quot;Woman. You need it!&quot; Instinctively, Kramer added reverb to the passage, just as Jimmy Page had done. They glanced at each other and laughed. Page then said &quot;Leave it in.&quot;

==== Kiss ====
In June 1973, a group of struggling rock musicians whose previous band, Wicked Lester, had flamed out, cut a five-song demo as &quot;Kiss&quot; with Kramer at Electric Lady Studios. Within two months they had a contract with Casablanca Records.
By late 1975, Kiss had a reputation for exciting stagecraft but lackluster album sales. They asked Kramer to produce their daring release of a 2-disc live album, &quot;Alive!&quot;. It subsequently reached gold status, then platinum, and multi-platinum, and generated the group&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;. This not only buoyed the group, it probably staved off a bankruptcy filing by their struggling label, and Kramer produced five more albums for the band that went platinum.

==== The Rolling Stones ====
Kramer was assistant engineer on &quot;Between the Buttons&quot;, &quot;Flowers&quot;, and &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. The work which he and producer Jimmy Miller had done with Traffic moved the Stones to book the pair for &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, their first album recorded without Andrew Loog Oldham, the group&#x27;s former manager and producer. &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; re-asserted the group&#x27;s R&amp;B roots. According to Kramer, Miller did much to position the Rolling Stones for the longevity which they have since enjoyed: &quot;He went to the heart and soul of where they came from; he was so adept at evoking the psyche of the band, and so clever at production. I&#x27;ve always tried to model myself after Jimmy in terms of how to get a session going, how to make the artists really get excited about what they&#x27;re playing.&quot;

==== The Beatles ====
Kramer and his cohorts at Olympic Studios caught a break when the Beatles&#x27; customary recording facility at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) was unavailable on 11 May 1967, when the Beatles wished to record &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re a Rich Man&quot;. Olympic was frantic to create a strong impression. By good fortune they happened to have a Clavioline, an early synthesizer, on hand. Lennon was fascinated by the instrument. He improvised droning, Indian-sounding passages to weave among the song&#x27;s verses. Olympic was subsequently chosen for the 14 June recording of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;. The songs comprised a two-sided Summer of 1967 Beatles&#x27; hit.
&quot;They were so disarming and so great in the studio,&quot; Kramer recalls, &quot;very targeted about what they&#x27;d come in to achieve.&quot;

<text>Nation Radio North East is an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting from studios in Sunderland to across the North East region of England which includes Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, County Durham, Teesside and parts of North Yorkshire. It is owned by Nation Broadcasting.

==Overview==
Nation Radio North East broadcasts on FM, DAB, as well as online. The station plays a mix of contemporary and classic popular music alongside local news and travel.

==Audience==
As of September 2024, the station broadcasts to a weekly audience of 25,000, according to RAJAR.

== History ==

=== Wear FM ===

The station was launched by the Sunderland Community Radio Station in 1990 and broadcast as Wear FM, based at the University of Sunderland. Wear FM gained international acclaim for its community programming and social inclusion and won the Sony Award for UK Radio Station of the Year in 1992.

Wear FM ceased transmissions in 1995 when it was taken over by the Minster Sound Group, who relaunched the station as Sun City FM. The station&#x27;s studios in the Forster Building were taken over by the University of Sunderland.

=== Sun City FM ===

Sun City took over when Wear FM ceased broadcasting in 1995. Sun City 103.4&#x27;s operator was financially penalised in that year by the Radio Authority for not fully adhering to elements of their Promise of Performance.

=== Sun FM ===

A sale to Border Radio Holdings followed with the new owners rebranding the station as Sun FM. In January 1999, Brian Lister joined as managing director. Sun FM became part of the Capital Radio Group when they acquired Border Radio in April 2000 as part of a three-way deal with Granada TV.


In March 2001, Radio Investments Limited purchased Sun FM and its parent company Bucks Broadcasting. This sale also included the other group station, Mix 96 in Aylesbury. Radio Investments later became known as The Local Radio Company and, in June 2009, was itself acquired by UKRD Group.

In 2018, UKRD Group sold Sun FM to Wales-based radio operator Nation Broadcasting. In March 2020, Nation Broadcasting bought neighbouring Durham Radio and Alpha Radio, merging the stations into Sun FM to enlarge the broadcast area to include large parts of County Durham.

=== Nation Radio North East ===
On 2 April 2024, Nation Broadcasting announced that Sun FM will be rebranded to Nation Radio North East as of 1 May 2024. They will also expand the station onto the local DAB multiplexes across the North East to include Newcastle, Gateshead, Middlesbrough, Bishop Auckland and Darlington.

== Current programming ==
As Nation Radio North East, local programming is broadcast from 6am-10am Monday to Friday, presented by Simon Grundy and 3pm-7pm Monday to Friday, presented by Dave Sherwood. The rest of the time it takes networked programming from Nation Radio UK, with opt-outs for news, sport, travel and weather updates.

== Transmission ==
Nation Radio North East&#x27;s transmission facility is located on farmland at Haining, to the south-west of Sunderland. It transmits with an ERP of 300 watts.

<doc id="956344" wikidata="Q1371398" url="?curid=956344" title="Flash (juggling)">
<text>In toss juggling, a flash is either a form of numbers juggling where each ball in a juggling pattern is only thrown and caught once or it is a juggling trick where every prop is simultaneously in the air and both hands are empty.

The former is considered by some not to be real juggling, however the term is used to distinguish the &quot;flash&quot; from the more continuous &quot;qualify&quot; or &quot;qualifying juggle&quot;, wherein every prop must be thrown and caught at least twice. For some tricks the number of throws and catches to complete a juggling cycle for that trick is not simply a multiple of the number of objects being juggled. For example, a three-ball cascade, one throw and catch per ball means three throws and three catches. However, for a four-ball Mills Mess, this means six throws &amp; catches, as one round of the pattern requires six throws to complete it.

The second meaning of a &#x27;flash&#x27; is a &quot;flashy&quot; move, such as a clap or a pirouette, performed by the juggler during a pattern with time when all props are in the air, such as during the 3 out of 5 juggling pattern, (siteswap: 55500). A three-ball flash is considered a good preparation for learning the five-ball cascade pattern.

World records are kept for both juggling (qualifying) and flashing (the first definition of the term) for balls and bean bags, clubs and sticks, and rings.

<doc id="956347" wikidata="Q9032006" url="?curid=956347" title="Metamorphosis II">
<text>Metamorphosis II is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher. It was created between November, 1939 and March, 1940. The print measures and was printed from 20 blocks on 3 combined sheets. &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; is a long, horizontal piece which depicts animals and other forms gradually transforming into each other.

Like &quot;Metamorphosis I&quot;, the concept of the piece is to morph one image into a tessellated pattern and then slowly alter that pattern eventually to become a new image. The process begins with the word &quot;metamorphose&quot; (the Dutch form of the word &quot;metamorphosis&quot;) in a black rectangle, followed by several smaller metamorphose rectangles forming a grid pattern. This grid then becomes a black and white checkered pattern, which then becomes tessellations of reptiles, a honeycomb, insects, fish, birds and a pattern of three-dimensional blocks with red tops. 

These blocks then become the architecture of the Italian coastal town of Atrani. Atrani is linked by a bridge to a tower in the water, which is simultaneously a rook standing on a chessboard. There are other chess pieces in the water and the water becomes a chessboard. The chessboard leads to a checkered wall, which then returns to the word &quot;metamorphose&quot;.

==Atrani and chess composition==

Among other motifs, &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; depicts an Italian village known to Escher, as well as a legible chess composition. 

Toward its right-hand side, the artwork depicts the coastline of Atrani, a small Italian village which Escher had rendered during his earlier career; Escher revisited the image of Atrani several times over the course of his life. In &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot;, a structure jutting from Atrani&#x27;s coastline becomes a white rook on a chessboard. The chessboard is shown in full, with a legal position—because White is in check, White manifestly has the move. White has exactly one legal move, which is therefore : another white rook, standing on the square f1, must capture the black queen standing on g1. The white king cannot capture the black queen, because it would then be attacked by the black bishop standing on b6, thus remaining in check. Following 1. Rxg1, Black has exactly one checking move, which is mate: 1... Nf2#.

This implied sequence—and its attendant final position—illustrate several chess concepts. Black has played a queen sacrifice in order to secure mate following White&#x27;s forced move. When mate is given, it is a smothered mate, in which the mated king is unable to move because surrounded by friendly pieces. Further, the black knight simultaneously attacks White&#x27;s king and queen in the final position, thus delivering a .

Escher was an amateur player, participating in chess club play throughout his life. In correspondence with his son George, Escher expressed concern as to the reasonableness of the position shown in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. However, he also noted that the position had never drawn any criticism, an indication of its status as a simple but well-formed problem.

The Atrani-chess dyad shown in &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; was used again in &quot;Metamorphosis III&quot;. The latter was a greatly expanded version of the former, which Escher executed near the end of his life. However, the town-and-chess position were identical in both pieces. For &quot;Metamorphosis III&quot;, Escher expanded the middle of &quot;Metamorphosis II&quot; to include several other elements, leaving its ends (which included the Atrani-chess dyad) unchanged.

<text>3TR FM (Three Towns Radio) was an Independent Local Radio station based in the market town of Warminster, Wiltshire, United Kingdom. It broadcast on 107.5 FM to the West Wiltshire, East Somerset and surrounding area, and online via Internet streaming. It was formerly known as Pride FM until a name change took place shortly after the licence was awarded.

==History==

On 5 November 2001, after a period of test transmissions, Jonathan Fido presented the first live programme, the breakfast show at 8:30am, accompanied by key local people from the area, staff from The Local Radio Company, and the station&#x27;s crew at the time.

The last song to be played before officially going live was &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; by Wet Wet Wet. A specially-produced introduction was then played featuring a montage of voice-overs, clips, and other segments officially launching the station. The first official song played was &quot;Wake Up Boo!&quot; by The Boo Radleys.

Shortly after the main on-air launch, James Moran and David Stratton (High Sheriff of Wiltshire) unveiled a gold plaque in the reception area of the station live on air, in front of many photographers and press reporters.

The station&#x27;s studio in Wiltshire included two broadcast and production studios, several offices, a &quot;glass room&quot; (meeting space) (dismantled in latter years), a technical equipment hub, and a garden adjacent to the River Wylye.

On 30 June 2008, TLRC announced plans to sell six of its stations, including 3TR. It was purchased by Laser Broadcasting, who later went bust, and the group was bought by South West Radio, who also went into administration. On 24 March 2010, the five YMC Ltd stations, including 3TR, were closed by administrators after multiple refusals on the part of regulator Ofcom to transfer the licences to them from SWR.

Cheltenham-based TotalStar was 3TR FM&#x27;s next owner, its fifth in less than two years. The company bought all of the stations previously owned by South West Radio Ltd. The firm already ran Star 107.5, which employed former BBC Radio 1 presenter Mike Read as its mid-morning presenter. The radio station was broadcast from Boreham Mill, in Warminster, but it was reported that it would now be aired from new offices, and would be sharing programmes with the five other stations.

The final schedule was as follows:
* Monday – Thursday:
* 07:00 – 11:00 Nick Burrett – Breakfast
* 11:00 – 14:00 Drew Haddon – The Soundtrack To Your Workday
* 14:00 – 19:00 Ray King – Afternoons/Hits &#x27;n&#x27; Headlines Drivetime

As from March 2010, when the station went into administration and the studio was dismantled, the following list of songs were the only things that could be heard when tuning into the station (arranged alphabetically; tracks were not played in this order). This was due to the silence detector at the transmitter site receiving nothing from the studio and hence activating its MiniDisc backup loop. The MiniDisc was put on eBay and raised money for charity; it was bought by Johnathan Darwin.

<doc id="956351" wikidata="Q1027454" url="?curid=956351" title="Calpis">
<text>, sold in North America as Calpico, is a Japanese non-carbonated soft drink manufactured by , a subsidiary of Asahi Breweries headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo. The beverage has a light, somewhat milky, and slightly acidic flavour, similar to plain or vanilla-flavoured yogurt or Yakult. Its ingredients include water, dry milk, and lactic acid, and it is produced by lactic acid fermentation.

The drink is sold as a concentrate, which is mixed with water or sometimes milk just before consumption. A pre-diluted version known as , or its carbonated variety, known as , is also available. It is also used to flavour kakigōri and as a mixer for cocktails and chūhai.

==History==

The founder of Calpis, , travelled to Inner Mongolia in 1902, encountering a traditional cultured milk product known as airag (called kumis throughout most of Central Asia). The active ingredient in airag, responsible for its unique flavour, is lactic acid produced by lactobacilli bacteria. After the airag he consumed helped return his digestion to normal, Mishima was inspired to develop his own version.

Daigomi, launched in 1916, was made by culturing cream with lactic acid bacteria. However, it was discontinued because of two major flaws: the amount of cream extracted from milk was inadequate for mass production, and there was a surplus of skimmed milk created as a by-product. Afterwards, Mishima created Daigoso by culturing skimmed milk with lactic acid bacteria. However, the product was also discontinued because of poor sales. His last unsuccessful attempt was Lacto Caramel, a product that contained live lactic acid bacteria. It was discontinued because the product melted during the summer.

Calpis was created by chance when Mishima added sugar to Daigoso and left it overnight. It was officially released on July 7, 1919, at the price of ¥1.60 per bottle. Diluting Calpis with water proved to be economical, quickly garnering popularity with customers, along with the catchphrase &quot;the taste of first love&quot;. Calpis initially had the image of being a special drink, being reserved for special occasions or gifts; it was only around 1965 that it began to be treated as a normal beverage in ordinary households.

Orange-flavoured Calpis was released in 1958, with pineapple- and grape-flavoured versions following two years later. A carbonated version called Calpis Soda was also released in 1974. In 1973, sales plummeted after the price was raised. Within the first year of its initial release in 1991, 20.5 million cases of pre-diluted Calpis Water had been sold. It was also around this time that the company moved towards the use of paper containers and plastic bottles.

=== Name ===
The first two iterations of what would become Calpis, &quot;Daigomi&quot; and &quot;Daigoso&quot;, were named after , the Japanese word for sarpir-maṇḍa, regarded as the greatest of all flavours in Buddhism. Mishima wanted to do the same for Calpis and initially named it &quot;Calpir&quot;, a portmanteau of &quot;cal&quot; from calcium and &quot;pir&quot; from sarpir-maṇḍa. However, after consulting musician Kōsaku Yamada and Buddhist priest Kaigyoku Watanabe, Mishima chose &quot;pis&quot; from the Sanskrit &quot;sarpiṣ&quot; instead.

Primarily in North America, the name Calpico is used in place of Calpis to avoid associations with &quot;&quot;, an English slang word for urine (though the &quot;カルピス&quot; in katakana remains on the packaging).

==Packaging==

The polka dot packaging used to consist of white dots against a blue background until the colours were inverted in 1953. The design was intended to represent the Milky Way, in reference to the Japanese Tanabata festival.

In 1919, Calpis held an international poster exhibition in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The contest was held to provide aid to struggling European painters due to inflation caused by World War I. After German painter Otto Dünkelsbühler won 3rd place, Calpis began using a new logo in 1923 based on his design. It featured an illustration of a black man with large lips and a Panama hat drinking from a glass using a straw. As the logo came to be considered offensive, the black and white were first reversed, and then the logo was subsequently dropped altogether in January 1990. The complaint was initially filed by 12-year-old Futoshi Arita, a member of The Association to Stop Racism Against Blacks.

2BR launched on 25 July 2000, serving the Burnley, Pendle and Hyndburn areas from studios at the Lomeshaye Industrial Estate in Nelson with its transmitter located on Pendle Hill in Newchurch in Pendle, near Fence.

A common misunderstanding is that the station&#x27;s name originally referred to the &quot;BB&quot; postcodes of Burnley, Pendle &amp; Hyndburn. This is incorrect. 2BR simply stood for Two Boroughs Radio. Whilst the name &#x27;Two Boroughs Radio - 2BR&#x27; was used on the three trial broadcasts (1997 and 1998), &#x27;Two Boroughs Radio&#x27; was dropped upon the full-time launch.

Broadcasting stations in the United Kingdom do not use callsigns, but as &quot;2&quot; is a prefix assigned by the ITU to callsigns in Great Britain, 2BR is technically a valid radio callsign.

In August 2010, the station moved to new studios at Clayton-le-Moors, co-locating with The Bee.

On 4 April 2016, UKRD announced 2BR would merge with sister Lancashire station The Bee as part of an expansion onto DAB across the county. The merged station carried the same 2BR programming and identity, alongside opt-outs for local news, traffic and advertising in the Burnley, Blackburn and Preston &amp; Chorley areas. DAB transmissions, via the Lancashire multiplex, commenced on Wednesday 1 June 2016.

On 31 July 2018, Global Radio announced it had bought 2BR from UKRD. The sale followed Global&#x27;s acquisition of another Lancashire station, &quot;The Bay&quot;, which relaunched as Heart North Lancashire &amp; Cumbria in March 2018.

===Closure===
On 26 February 2019, Global confirmed 2BR would be relaunched as Capital Lancashire and form part of the Capital radio network on 8 April 2019. The station was merged with Capital&#x27;s Manchester station.

2BR ceased broadcasting at 7pm on Friday 29 March 2019, with the station entering a transition period ahead of the full relaunch as Capital. The station&#x27;s studios at Clayton-le-Moors closed with operations moving to Manchester. The final song played on the station was &quot;Unwritten&quot; by Natasha Bedingfield.

Local output for Greater Manchester and Lancashire consists of a three-hour regional Drivetime show on weekdays, alongside localised news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising. Separate local news services are produced for the Blackburn &amp; Preston and Burnley &amp; Pendle areas.

<doc id="956354" wikidata="Q796778" url="?curid=956354" title="BMW X5">
<text>The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury crossover SUV produced by BMW. The X5 made its debut in 1999 as the E53 model. It was BMW&#x27;s first SUV. At launch, it featured all-wheel drive and was available with either a manual or automatic gearbox. The second generation was launched in 2006, and was known internally as the E70. The E70 featured the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic gearbox. In 2009, the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model.

BMW marketed the X5 officially as a &quot;Sports Activity Vehicle&quot; (SAV), rather than an SUV, to indicate its on-road handling capability despite its large dimensions. The X5 signaled a shift away from the utilisation of body-on-frame construction, in favour of more modern monocoque chassis construction. Although the Mercedes-Benz M-Class was introduced more than a year prior to the X5, the X5 was the first to utilise a monocoque chassis. The M-Class used body-on-frame construction until its second generation.

The X5 is primarily manufactured in North America, at BMW Group Plant Spartanburg. Assembly operations also take place in Russia by Avtotor until February 2022, along with operations in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The X5 is also modified for armoured security versions, at the BMW de México Toluca plant.

The automaker&#x27;s SAV series, which was started by the X5, has expanded with derivations of other number-series BMWs. This began in 2003 with the X3, and continued in 2008 with the X6 (which shares its platform with the X5).

== First generation (E53; 1999–2006) ==
The E53 X5 was manufactured between 1999 and 2006. It was developed shortly after BMW Group&#x27;s acquisition of British off-road vehicle manufacturer Land Rover. BMW vehicles in turn benefitted significantly from Land Rover&#x27;s technology. The first generation X5 shares many components with the Range Rover (L322) model (specifically the hill descent control and off-road engine management systems). The engine and electronic systems were shared with the BMW E39 5 Series.

A series of petrol inline-6 and V-8 engines were offered, along with diesel engines. Engine displacement ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 litres.

Production for the 2004 model year facelift began in late 2003.
== Second generation (E70; 2006–2013) ==

The E70 X5 is the second generation of the X5. It debuted in July 2006 for the 2007 model year. The second generation featured key improvements, including BMW&#x27;s iDrive system as standard across models, and an optional third row of seats for increased seven-passenger capacity.

Trim and engine level nomenclature for the X5 after 2008 follows the same nomenclature used for other BMW vehicles. The X5 3.0si was renamed the X5 xDrive30i, and the X5 4.8i was renamed the X5 xDrive48i. In 2010 BMW replaced the DVD-based CCC system (which powered iDrive) with a CIC hard drive system.

In 2009, the diesel xDrive35d variant became available in Canada and the United States, along with the BMW 335d 3-Series sedan.

The M Performance variant was unveiled at the New York Auto Show in April 2009, and went on sale in September 2009 (2010 model year). Sharing its drivetrain with the X6 M, the X5 M featured BMW&#x27;s first turbocharged M Power V-8, producing and of torque.

The E70 received a facelift for the 2011 model year, known as the LCI.

For the 2011 model year, the X5 became BMW&#x27;s 3rd best-selling model, after the best-selling 3 Series (E90), and second best-selling 5 Series (F10).
== Third generation (F15/F85; 2013–2018) ==

The F15 X5 (or F85 for the X5 M) is the third generation of the X5, and was first unveiled to the public on 30 May 2013. It officially debuted in November 2013.

It shared the same chassis and wheelbase as the E70, and introduced a choice of three engines. The range included the xDrive50i (petrol V8 producing 450 bhp), the xDrive30d (turbocharged inline-6 diesel producing 258 bhp), and the M50d Performance (turbocharged inline-6 diesel producing 380 bhp). In December 2013, additional engine options became available. This included the inline-6 xDrive40d and xDrive35i models, as well as the inline-4 xDrive25d (all-wheel drive) and sDrive25d (rear-wheel drive) models. BMW added a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle model (the xDrive40e), which was powered by a turbocharged inline-4 engine. The xDrive40e&#x27;s electric motor achieves a peak power output of 83 kW, and a continuous output of 55 kW with the 9kWh 351V Li-ion battery pack.

== Fourth generation (G05/G18/F95; 2018–present) ==

The G05 X5 is the fourth (and current) generation of the X5. It was unveiled to the public online, on 6 June 2018. It officially debuted in November 2018. It is based on the BMW Group&#x27;s new Cluster Architecture (CLAR) chassis.

All 2019 model year X5s were equipped with xDrive all-wheel drive. An sDrive (rear-wheel drive) variant was added to the US model lineup for 2020. The 2020 X5 sDrive was powered by BMW&#x27;s inline-6 petrol B58 engine (the sDrive40i).

Another 2020 model year addition was the xDrive45e PHEV. It also has the firm&#x27;s B58 engine, mated with an electric motor. The result is a combined power output of from its larger 24 kWh battery pack.

The wheelbase of the G18 is extended by 13 cm over the standard X5, mirroring the wheelbase of the X7 and XM. The G18 was assembled at BMW Plant Shenyang in Shenyang.

=== Awards ===

* In January 2021, the X5 xDrive45e M Sport was named Luxury SUV of the Year by &quot;What Car?&quot; magazine. &quot;What Car?&quot; awarded the X5 five stars out of five in its review of the car.

=== Limited Editions ===

* BMW X5 M Competition First Edition 

* BMW X5 Black Vermilion

<doc id="956355" wikidata="Q7314351" url="?curid=956355" title="Reptiles (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Reptiles is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in March 1943. It touches on the theme found in much of his work of mathematics in art.

==Work==

&quot;Reptiles&quot; depicts a desk upon which is a two dimensional drawing of a tessellated pattern of reptiles and hexagons, Escher&#x27;s 1939 &quot;Regular Division of the Plane&quot;. The reptiles at one edge of the drawing emerge into three dimensional reality, come to life and appear to crawl over a series of symbolic objects (a book on nature, a geometer&#x27;s triangle, a three dimensional dodecahedron, a pewter bowl containing a box of matches and a box of cigarettes) to eventually re-enter the drawing at its opposite edge. Other objects on the desk are a potted cactus and yucca, a ceramic flask with a cork stopper next to a small glass of liquid, a book of JOB cigarette rolling papers, and an open handwritten note book of many pages. Although only the size of small lizards, the reptiles have protruding crocodile-like fangs, and the one atop the dodecahedron has a dragon-like puff of smoke billowing from its nostrils.

Once a woman telephoned Escher and told him that she thought the image was a &quot;striking illustration of reincarnation&quot;.

The critic Steven Poole commented that one of Escher&#x27;s &quot;enduring fascinations&quot; was &quot;the contrast between the two-dimensional flatness of a sheet of paper and the illusion of three-dimensional volume that can be created with certain marks&quot; when space and flatness exist side by side and are &quot;each born from and returning to the other, the black magic of the artistic illusion made creepily manifest.&quot;

==In popular culture==

A colorized version of the lithograph was used by the rock band Mott the Hoople as the sleeve artwork for its eponymous first album, released in 1969.

== Music ==
In 1993, Graham Waterhouse composed a piano trio, &quot;Four Epigraphs after Escher&quot;, in four movements, with the final one based on &quot;Reptiles&quot;.

<doc id="956356" wikidata="Q7752369" url="?curid=956356" title="The Most Happy Fella">
<text>The Most Happy Fella is a 1956 musical with a book, music, and lyrics by Frank Loesser. The story, about a romance between an older man and younger woman, is based on the 1924 play &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; by Sidney Howard. The show is described by some theatre historians and critics as operatic. The original Broadway production ran for 14 months and it has enjoyed several revivals, including one staged by the New York City Opera.

It was broadcast in a live telecast of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on Sunday, October 28, 1956, the night of Elvis Presley&#x27;s second appearance on that show. That broadcast was seen in some 168 stations in North America and garnered a 34.6 rating, a 57% share, with an estimated audience of 56.5 million viewers.

==Background and history==
A friend of Frank Loesser&#x27;s recommended the Howard play &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot; as material for a musical in 1952. After he read it, Loesser agreed it had musical potential, but decided to omit the political, labor, and religious material. It took him four years to complete the musical.

&quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; frequently has been described as an opera, but some have qualified the term. In his book &quot;The World of Musical Comedy&quot;, Stanley Green noted that the musical is &quot;one of the most ambitiously operatic works ever written for the Broadway theatre ... Loesser said &#x27;I may give the impression this show has operatic tendencies. If people feel that way – fine. Actually all it has is a great frequency of songs. It&#x27;s a musical with music.&#x27; &quot; In an article in the &quot;Playbill Magazine&quot; for the original Broadway production, Loesser wrote, &quot;What was left seemed to me to be a very warm simple love story, happy ending and all, and dying to be sung and danced.&quot; Brooks Atkinson, theatre critic (&quot;The New York Times&quot;), called it a &quot;music drama&quot;, noting Loesser &quot;has now come about as close to opera as the rules of Broadway permit.&quot; Composer, conductor, and musical theatre teacher Lehman Engel and critic/author Howard Kissel called it a &quot;fresh musical (perhaps opera)&quot;. Music Theatre International describes the show: &quot;Filled with sweeping ballads, intense dramatic arias and tuneful, splashy Broadway-style numbers, this ambitious &quot;Broadway opera&quot; has found a home on opera and musical-theatre stages alike.&quot;

A film version was planned in 1962, to be produced by Warner Bros. with Shirley Jones and Fred Astaire set to star. However, Jones was busy making &quot;The Music Man&quot; for Warner Bros., so she was dropped and Natalie Wood was brought in. Wood was also busy though, making &quot;Gypsy&quot; for Warner Bros.. Astaire downright refused to participate in the project, but came back to the studio to make &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. The film never came to fruition. A revival of the film was discussed in the 1980s, but never got anywhere.

==Synopsis==
;Act 1
In the Golden Gate Restaurant in San Francisco in 1927, tired and harassed young waitress Cleo commiserates with her friend. Cleo&#x27;s feet hurt (&quot;Ooh My Feet&quot;) and her friend has had to fend off the cashier&#x27;s advances (&quot;I Know How It Is&quot;). As they clean up (&quot;Seven Million Crumbs&quot;), Cleo&#x27;s friend finds a jeweled tie pin and a note addressed to the friend as &quot;Rosabella&quot;, written in odd broken English (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know (The Letter)&quot;). She decides to answer, thinking of the possibilities (&quot;Somebody, Somewhere&quot;).

In Napa, the mailman has a letter for Tony Esposito, who has been enjoying a &quot;mail order love affair&quot; for the past four months. Tony, a large and hearty older Italian immigrant and a successful grape farmer, happily shows the crowd the picture of his &quot;girlfriend&quot; (&quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;). Meek farmhand Herman expresses admiration of his boss&#x27;s initiative in pursuing Rosabella (&quot;Standing on the Corner&quot;). But as Tony prepares to send his own picture in return, his sister Marie points out that he is too old and unattractive for a beautiful young woman like Rosabella, and he accepts that she is probably right. At that moment Joe, the young, handsome and nomadic farm foreman, arrives to tell Tony that he plans to leave town and travel somewhere else (&quot;Joey, Joey, Joey&quot;). Tony sees his opportunity and asks Joe for a photograph as a memento, then sends it as his own to his beloved (&quot;Rosabella&quot;).

Several weeks later, Rosabella has agreed to come to Napa and marry Tony (&quot;Abbondanza&quot;), but as he prepares to leave for the bus station to collect her, imagining their future together (&quot;Plenty Bambini&quot;), he discovers to his horror that Joe has remained in town longer than planned to attend the wedding (&quot;Spozalizio&quot;). Rosabella arrives at the farm with the postman (&quot;Special Delivery,&quot; &quot;Benvenuta&quot;) and meets Joe (&quot;Aren&#x27;t You Glad?&quot;), only to discover that he is not Tony. Upset at the subterfuge, she starts to leave. However, Tony has been injured in a truck accident en route to the bus station, and he pleads with Rosabella to stay and marry him immediately in case he does not live. She relents (&quot;No Home, No Job&quot;) and they marry. Joe, who now must stay to run the ranch during Tony&#x27;s convalescence, is upset but tries to comfort her (&quot;Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;), and in a moment of mutual weakness they embrace.

;Act 2
A week later (&quot;Fresno Beauties&quot;), Joe and Rosabella regret their indiscretion (&quot;Cold and Dead&quot;), and at the encouragement of Tony&#x27;s doctor (&quot;Love and Kindness&quot;), the newlywed couple makes a fresh start (&quot;Happy to Make Your Acquaintance&quot;). Cleo arrives in Napa, revealing that Tony has sent for her and offered her a job to keep Rosabella company, and she immediately takes a dislike to Marie (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Like This Dame&quot;) but hits it off with fellow Texan Herman (&quot;Big D&quot;). As time passes, Tony and Rosabella grow closer, Marie feels increasingly lonely, and Joe longs to travel again (&quot;How Beautiful the Days&quot;). Marie tries to convince Tony that the age difference between him and Rosabella is too great (&quot;Young People&quot;), and he believes her even though Rosabella herself indicates otherwise (&quot;Warm All Over&quot;). Cleo and Herman also grow closer, though she is frustrated by his passive, compliant nature (&quot;I Like Everybody&quot;). She urges Rosabella to tell Tony of her feelings, as Tony is treating her like a child rather than a wife (&quot;I Love Him/I Know How it Is&quot;). Tony, overjoyed by Rosabella&#x27;s expression of love (&quot;Like a Woman Loves a Man&quot;), discards his cane (&quot;My Heart Is So Full of You&quot;). Later Rosabella collapses at a party (&quot;Hoedown&quot;), and the doctor tells her she is pregnant (with Joe&#x27;s child). She is upset by this news, and Cleo rushes her away before she can tell the still-overjoyed Tony (&quot;Mamma, Mamma&quot;).

;Act 3
In Tony&#x27;s barn a short time later, Cleo hints to Herman that she may be leaving (&quot;Goodbye, Darlin&#x27;&quot;) but he remains unbelievingly cheerful, to her frustration. As the preparations for the wedding party are taking place, the doctor asks the community to leave the couple alone for a little while (&quot;Song of a Summer Night&quot;). Rosabella tells Tony she is pregnant (&quot;Please Let Me Tell You&quot;). Tony rejects her in a rage when she reveals that Joe is the father. She and Cleo leave to return to San Francisco, but when Tony learns that Joe is leaving as well, he concludes that they are leaving together and rushes to the bus station with a gun to confront them. When he discovers that Joe has already left (&quot;Tell Tony and Rosabella Goodbye for Me&quot;), however, he resolves to forgive her (&quot;She Gonna Come Home Wit&#x27; Me&quot;). Marie begs her brother to let her go (&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Ever Gonna Love You&quot;) and snatches away his cane to prevent him from leaving, but Cleo attacks her and grabs it back. Brutish farmhand Pasquale intervenes in the struggle, and Herman finally finds the nerve to stand up for her by striking Pasquale (&quot;I Made a Fist&quot;). Tony convinces Rosabella to return to their home, where they will tell their friends and the townspeople Tony is the father. Reunited with Rosabella and soon to be a father, Tony affirms that he truly is &quot;the most happy fella.&quot; (&quot;Finale&quot;).

==Productions==
=== Try-outs ===
The try-out of &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot; opened in Boston on Tuesday, March 13, 1956, at the Shubert Theatre to good reviews. The show then moved to Philadelphia for a try-out at the Shubert Theatre, opening on Tuesday, April 10, 1956, also to good notices.

=== Original Broadway production ===
Directed by Joseph Anthony and choreographed by Dania Krupska, the original Broadway production was produced by Kermit Bloomgarden and Lynn Loesser and opened on May 3, 1956 at the Imperial Theatre, transferred to the Broadway Theatre on October 21, 1957 and closed on December 14, 1957 after 676 performances. The cast included Robert Weede as Tony, Jo Sullivan as Rosabella, Art Lund as Joey, Susan Johnson as Cleo, Shorty Long – the country and not the soul singer – as Herman and Mona Paulee as Marie. The future dancer and actress Zina Bethune appeared as Tessie, one of the children in the ensemble. The scenic and lighting design was by Jo Mielziner.

The original production was partially bankrolled by Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. (See &quot;In Popular Culture&quot;, below.)

=== Subsequent productions ===
The New York City Center staged a limited run of 16 performances from February 10 through February 22, 1959. The cast included Norman Atkins as Tony, Paula Stewart as Rosabella, Libi Staiger as Cleo, Art Lund as Joe, Jack DeLeon as Herman, Muriel Birkhead as Marie, and Bernadette Peters as Tessie.

The West End production, directed by Jerome Eskow, opened at the London Coliseum on April 21, 1960, and ran for 288 performances. The cast included Inia Te Wiata as Tony, Helena Scott as Rosabella, Art Lund as Joey, Libi Staiger as Cleo, Jack De Leon as Herman, and Nina Verushka as Marie. Inia Te Wiata also starred in the Australian production, which played the Princess Theatre, Melbourne and the Palace Theatre, Sydney in 1961.

A Broadway revival began previews at the Majestic Theatre on September 20, 1979, officially opened on October 11, and closed on November 25, 1979, after 53 performances and 23 previews. Directed by Jack O&#x27;Brien, set design by Douglas W. Schmidt, costumes by Nancy Potts, lighting by Gilbert Vaughn Hemsley Jr., orchestrations by Don Walker, and choreographed by Graciela Daniele, it starred Giorgio Tozzi as Tony, Frederick Burchinal as Tony (Wed. and Sat. matinees), Sharon Daniels as Rosabella, Linda Michelle as Rosabella (Wed. and Sat. matinees), Adrienne Leonetti as Marie, Steven Alex-Cole as Max, Dennis Warning as Herman, Dean Badolato as Clem, David Miles as Jake, Kevin Wilson as Al, Stephen Dubov as Sheriff, Gene Varrone as Giuseppe, Darren Nimnicht as Pasquale, Tim Flavin as Busboy, Dan O&#x27;Sullivan as Postman, Franco Spoto as Ciccio, Joe McGrath as Doctor, Lawrence Asher as Priest, Michael Capes as Bus Driver, Bill Hastings as Cashier/brakeman, Louisa Flaningam as Cleo, and Richard Muenz as Joe. The production was filmed and later broadcast by PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 1980. A 2-DVD set of this PBS performance was released in the 2000s.

A New York City Opera production ran from September 4 through October 18, 1991. Directed by Arthur Alan Seidelman, it starred Louis Quilico as Tony, Elizabeth Walsh as Rosabella, and Karen Ziemba as Cleo.

The Goodspeed Opera House presented the musical, directed by Gerald Gutierrez, in May and June 1991. This production had two pianos instead of a full orchestra, using a Loesser-approved piano arrangement by Robert Page. The production was then staged by the Center Theatre Group at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles for ten weeks starting in October 1991. In exchange for mounting the show, the Center Theatre Group shared in potential Broadway profits.

Based on the Goodspeed production, with most of the cast and creative team intact, a Broadway revival began previews at the Booth Theatre on January 24, 1992, officially opened on February 13, and closed on August 30 after 229 performances. Again directed by Gerald Gutierrez, the cast included Spiro Malas as Tony, Sophie Hayden as Rosabella, Charles Pistone as Joe, Claudia Catania as Marie, Liz Larsen as Cleo, and Scott Waara as Herman.

The Ravinia Festival in Chicago presented a concert version with George Hearn as Tony and Rod Gilfry as Joe on July 20, 2007.

The New York City Opera presented a limited engagement with Paul Sorvino as Tony and Lisa Vroman as Rosabella between March 7–25, 2006.

In February 2013, Tulsa Opera presented a production directed by Dorothy Danner and conducted by Kostis Protopapas, featuring Chaim Joseph as Tony, Latrine Thurman as Rosabella, and Christopher Foeum as Joe.

In April 2014, New York City Center Encores! presented a well-received production directed by Casey Nicholaw and starring Shuler Hensley, Laura Benanti, Cheyenne Jackson, Heidi Blickenstaff, Jay Armstrong Johnson &amp; Jessica Molaskey.

==Recordings==
The original Broadway cast recording was produced by Goddard Lieberson for Columbia Records. The recording featured virtually the entire show, including all but a few lines of the dialogue, which was unusual for the time. Because the score was so extensive, the cast album had to be released as a three LP record set. Columbia also released a more conventional album of excerpted highlights. The original cast album was re-released on November 15, 1991 by Sony (ASIN: B0000027TC). The 1992 Broadway revival cast album was produced by RCA Victor Broadway (ASIN: B000003FBK) and released on June 9, 1992. Jay Records released a &quot;complete&quot; studio recording (CDJAY2 1306), including material that had been cut, on July 11, 2000. The recording was conducted by John Owen Edwards and featured Loesser&#x27;s daughter Emily as Rosabella and Louis Quilico as Tony.

John Sterling, radio announcer for the New York Yankees, refers to this musical in his &quot;home run call&quot; whenever Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela hits a home run. As Urshela circles the bases, Sterling says &quot;Gio Urshela... a most happy fella!&quot;
In 1957 on the television show &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (Season 6, episode 22 titled &quot;Lucy’s Night In Town&quot;), the Ricardos and Mertzes travel to New York City from their new country home in Connecticut to attend a sold-out evening performance of &quot;The Most Happy Fella&quot;. During dinner they discover Lucy had mistakenly purchased tickets for the matinee. Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball&#x27;s Desilu Productions owned a large portion of the show, and was cross-promoting it in the episode. Three songs from the show are heard in scenes showing the characters sitting in the theater. At one point, Fred Mertz is inspired by the title to remark, &quot;The guy is not married.&quot;

<doc id="956357" wikidata="Q17101489" url="?curid=956357" title="Vale FM">
<text>Greatest Hits Radio Dorset (North Dorset) (formerly Vale FM) is an Independent Local Radio station which broadcasts to the Blackmore Vale and Cranborne Chase, from Shaftesbury, Dorset, in southern England.

==Background==

In the summer of 2008 Chris Carnegy who was the founder and driving force behind the start of the radio station acquired Vale FM from The Local Radio Company. He restructured and rebranded it. During the ownership of TLRC the station moved studios, continuing at the Longmead Industrial Estate in Shaftesbury, overseen by Programme Controller and Station Manager Stewart Smith. Midwest Radio – a project which saw the combining of programmes and resources with Ivel FM in Yeovil, now also identified as Midwest Radio. Carnegy left in March 2009 to join the BBC and the Midwest stations were acquired by Devon businesswoman Michele Roberts.

Cameron Smith continued presenting the weekday morning breakfast show from Shaftesbury through the transition and also recorded a regular weekend 80s show. In May 2010 the Shaftesbury studios were closed and all programme production moved to Yeovil. The breakfast show was taken over temporarily by David Mortimer and Cameron&#x27;s long association with the station ended.

David Mortimer&#x27;s temporary stewardship of the breakfast show ended on Friday 20 August 2010 and Jason Herbert, previously with Wessex FM, took over as the new breakfast presenter from the following Monday.

It was reported in the Blackmore Vale Magazine that Midwest Radio had been given permission by Ofcom to have a single breakfast show, but John Baker, the station manager, said &quot;the group had no plans to close either of its centres or to stop broadcasting separate breakfast shows for South Somerset and North Dorset. Although we now have permission from Ofcom to share our breakfast hours, we will not be doing this.&quot; Mr Baker implied that broadcasting was continuing from the Shaftesbury studios but this was not the case.

However, by March 2011 the breakfast show had indeed merged, with a single presenter – Steve Carpenter – based in Yeovil and the departure of Jason Herbert. And the fallacy that Mid West was continuing to broadcast from Shaftesbury also had come to an end with the local contact address now being given as &quot;Compton Abbas Airfield, near Salisbury&quot;.

The station became part of the UKRD Group In 2020, Vale, along with the other UKRD stations, were sold to Bauer Media and the station was 
rebranded as Greatest Hits Radio Salisbury in September 2020, as part of their national Greatest Hits Radio network. It now broadcasts national and regional music programmes with local news bulletins.

<text>Wessex FM was an Independent Local Radio station for the Weymouth, Dorchester and Bridport areas of Dorset, originating from studios in Dorchester. It broadcast on 97.2 MHz in Weymouth and Dorchester (from the Bincombe Hill transmitter), and on 96.0 MHz in Bridport (from the Bridport transmitter).

==History==
===Early days===
A group of local radio enthusiasts had been campaigning to have an Independent Local Radio (ILR) station in Dorset for some time. The Radio Authority advertised the licence early in 1992 and awarded it to ‘Regent Radio’ in early 1993. 

Regent Radio comprised a group of local business people - including property investor Peter Bolton, local museum owner Michael Ridley and Tom Singh founder of New Look - together with corporate backing from Orchard Media (owners of Taunton’s Orchard FM) and Radio Investments. 

The founding managing director was Stephen Oates, appointed in February 1993, who had previously launched Isle of Wight Radio in 1990 and subsequently went on to launch Spirit FM in West Sussex in 1996.

Steve secured suitable premises in Trinity Street in the centre of Dorchester, and conversion and studio construction took two months during the summer of 1993. Transmission facilities were contracted to NTL, using the Bincombe transmission mast.

The station name - Wessex FM - was chosen, together with the original strap line ‘Pure Dorset Radio’ and a completely new team was recruited with Roger Kennedy as programme manager, Jane Soole as head of news and Derek Bateman as sales manager. The main on-air team initially comprised Iain Meadows on Breakfast, Roger Kennedy on mid-mornings, Maria Ferguson on afternoons, and Stuart McGinley evenings. 

The station went on-air, initially only broadcasting on 97.2FM, at 10am on 4 September 1993, with several special guests including veteran presenter Tony Blackburn and Lionel Blair. As part of the on-air launch day the station undertook its first outside broadcast at the Dorchester County Show. A relay for Bridport and surrounding villages was later launched on 96.0FM to address weak reception due to the topography of West Dorset.

===Wessex FM before its closure===
Until its closure on 31 August 2020, it had a reach percentage of 42%.

=== Programming ===
All of Wessex FM&#x27;s programming was produced and broadcast from its Dorchester studios. Presenter-led programming aired from 6am – midnight on weekdays, 6am – 6pm on Saturdays and 8am – 4pm on Sundays. All other output was automated.

== Closure ==
Wessex FM was purchased by Bauer Media in 2019 along with other stations in the UKRD Group. On 27 May 2020 it was announced that Wessex FM will become Greatest Hits Radio from early September 2020. The station went through a transitional period where its playlist was changed over to the 70s, 80s and 90s era and jingles changed to reflect the station playing &quot;greatest hits&quot;. Wessex FM was finally rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio at 6:00am on 1 September 2020.

<doc id="956361" wikidata="Q5306274" url="?curid=956361" title="Dream 107.2">
<text>Dream 107.2 was an Independent Local Radio station, primarily serving Winchester, Eastleigh and their conurbations, owned by the Tindle Radio Group.

== History ==
Win 107.2 launched in 1999 financed by Radio Investments Ltd, from studios in The Brooks Shopping Centre in Winchester town centre, and marketed with the slogan &quot;best music, breaking news&quot;. A buyout of Radio Investments saw the station rebrand to 107.2 Win FM in 2004 under the ownership of The Local Radio Company.

Win FM was sold to the Tindle Radio by The Local Radio Company in September 2006, and in an effort to distinguish the station from its more successful rivals in its transmission area, was rebranded as Dream 107.2 in October 2007, adopting a soft adult contemporary music policy in early 2008 akin to that of London-based Magic 105.4 and latter-day competitor The Coast 106, which launched in October 2008.

In November 2008 Dream 107.2 became a relay for Radio Hampshire, simulcasting all output except for &quot;four hours a day of bespoke programming&quot;.

The first song to be played on Dream 107.2 was Candi Staton&#x27;s &quot;Young Hearts Run Free&quot; during Breakfast with Andy Green and the last was The Moody Blues&#x27; &quot;Go Now&quot; which was played during Pippa Head&#x27;s Mid-Morning Show.

== Performance ==

Faced with competition from several regional rivals, Dream struggled to deliver large numbers of listeners, and withdrew from RAJAR audience measurement surveys a year before its closure. In its final survey (in the final quarter of 2007), Dream had 9,000 weekly listeners, with a market share of 1.4%.

<doc id="956362" wikidata="Q14866672" url="?curid=956362" title="Magic Mirror (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Magic Mirror is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in January, 1946.

It depicts a mirror standing vertically on wooden supports on a tiled surface. The perspective is looking down at an angle at the right hand side of the mirror. There is a sphere at each side of the mirror. The main focus of the image is a procession of small griffin (winged lion) sculptures that emerge from the surface of the mirror and trail away from it in single file. Both the angular reflection of the tiles and the offset between the reflection of the sphere in front of the mirror and the sphere behind it prove it is a mirror. Yet the reflection of the griffin procession continues to emerge from behind the mirror. The griffin processions of both sides loop around to the front and enter a tessellated pattern on the tile surface.

<doc id="956364" wikidata="Q7797835" url="?curid=956364" title="Three Spheres II">
<text>Three Spheres II is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in April 1946.

As the title implies, it depicts three spheres resting on a flat surface.

The sphere on the left is transparent (see ball lens) with a photorealistic depiction of the refracted light cast through it towards the viewer and onto the flat surface.

The sphere in the center is reflective. Its reflection is a self-replicating image of Escher in his studio drawing the three spheres. In the reflection one can clearly see the image of the three spheres on the paper Escher is drawing on: in the center sphere of that image, one can vaguely make out the reflection of Escher&#x27;s studio, which is depicted in the main image. This process is implied to be infinite, recursive.

The sphere on the right is opaque and diffuse, i.e. neither specularly reflective nor transparent.

The painting is in the Escher Museum in The Hague.

<doc id="956365" wikidata="Q8055687" url="?curid=956365" title="Yorkshire Coast Radio">
<text>Yorkshire Coast Radio was an Independent Local Radio station serving Scarborough, Whitby &amp; Bridlington. The station was folded into Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, as part of a rebrand, on 1 September 2020.

==History==
For many years, several businessmen in Scarborough had campaigned for their own local radio station. A licence was advertised in 1991 and contested by three groups. The winning consortium, Yorkshire Coast Radio Limited, was founded by radio executive and former presenter Paul Rusling with backing from former Conservative MP Wilf Proudfoot, who served as managing director for short-lived pirate station Radio 270, which was based in the town. After the franchise was awarded, YCR was bought out by Minster Sound plc – the owners of neighbouring York-based station Minster FM, which began broadcasting in July 1992.

Yorkshire Coast Radio was launched on Sunday 7 November 1993, broadcasting local programming from 6 am-10 pm each day with overnight output simulcast from Minster FM. Originally, the station had planned to broadcast from the Heatherleigh, a trawler moored in Scarborough&#x27;s harbour which later became a museum. When the station was brought, YCR opted for conventional studios at Falsgrave Road near the town centre, before later moving to purpose-built facilities in Eastfield, on the outskirts of town.

On 7 November 1999, Yorkshire Coast Radio expanded after its owners were awarded the licence to cover the neighbouring Bridlington area. The station operated as a part-time opt-out of Yorkshire Coast Radio and was called Yorkshire Coast Radio Bridlington.

Yorkshire Coast Radio broadcast to Scarborough and Filey on 96.2 FM, Bridlington on 102.4 FM and Whitby on 103.1 FM.

On 17 February 2015, Yorkshire Coast Radio launched a DAB simulcast on the MuxCo North Yorkshire multiplex.

For a number of years the station also operated an online service called &#x27;Yorkshire Coast Radio Extra&#x27; which broadcast news and interviews as well as football commentaries on Scarborough Athletic, Bridlington Town and Whitby Town games.

In 2018, the station launched an additional service, Yorkshire Coast Radio 70s.

UKRD&#x27;s local radio stations, including Yorkshire Coast Radio, were bought by Bauer Radio in 2019, and in May 2020, Bauer announced it would merge the AM and FM stations in Yorkshire to form the Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire sub-network as part of a wider restructuring of its local radio stations.

On 1 September 2020, it became a part of Bauer Radio&#x27;s Greatest Hits radio network with music from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s – this type of music having been phased in since its takeover. and Tom Hooper had presented the final programme from Scarborough for Yorkshire Coast Radio two days earlier.

Former notable presenters on the station include Joel Ross (later one half of JK and Joel).

The last of the former Yorkshire Coast Radio presenters Paddy Billington, Kev Roberts, Tom Hooper, Mike Nicholson, Tom Ironside and Matthew Pells are currently on the radio station This is The Coast which is online and on DAB.

==Programming==
Regional programming is produced and broadcast from Bauer&#x27;s Leeds studios from 1-4pm on weekdays, presented by Steve Priestley.

In the official RAJAR audience data for Q2 2018, Yorkshire Coast Radio achieved a 53% weekly reach which was higher than for any other radio station in the UK.

===News===
Yorkshire Coast Radio broadcast hourly local news bulletins from 6 am–10 pm on weekdays and 8 am–12 pm at weekends, with headlines on the half-hour during weekday breakfast.

Its journalists were based at the radio station&#x27;s Scarborough studios and also produced content for the station&#x27;s website and smartphone app.

National bulletins from Sky News Radio were carried every hour at all other times.

<text>The Local Radio Company was a British media company, based in Redruth, Cornwall, that owned eleven Independent Local Radio stations in the UK. After takeover talks with UTV Media, UKRD Group and Hallwood Financial, UKRD acquired the majority share of the company in June 2009.

==History==
TLRC was formed in 1996 as a joint venture between its majority shareholder Radio Investments Limited and GWR Group plc, with founding Chief Executive Chris Carnegy also holding a small stake. It was designed as a specialist operator of small stations and its initial portfolio consisted of stations transferred from the founders: Spire FM, Gold Radio, KCBC and Boss 603 Cheltenham from RIL, and Isle of Wight Radio from GWR. The group expanded rapidly by acquisitions and new licence wins.

Changes in structure saw a merger between TLRC, RIL and RIL subsidiary Radio Services. At its peak the merged private company owned or invested in 28 stations, spread between Stirling in Scotland and the Isle of Wight, and between Lowestoft and Plymouth. From 2000, the Guardian Media Group held a management contract, with its radio chief John Myers taking charge.

The group was sold in 2004 and began a new life as The Local Radio Company plc, an AIM-quoted public company under the leadership of former Jazz FM CEO Richard Wheatly.

For a while, all stations owned by the quoted group, except Fire Radio, broadcast under a contemporary music format known as Music:fun:life. However this was generally not deemed a success so, after the departure of Group Programme Director Gordon Davidson in June 2006 to Emap, most stations developed their own branding.

The playlist offered a mix of new and classic pop music, with some special programming such as &quot;Party Anthems&quot; or &quot;Soul on Sunday&quot;. Network programmes broadcast by the group include &quot;The Lunchtime Gameshow&quot; which returned to the network after a break of 2 years in November 2008, hosted by John Harding and Russ Leighton broadcasting from Minster FM in York to the Northern TLRC stations; the hit40uk chart show; the urban chart show Fresh 40 and the Fierce Angel Radio Show on Saturday nights.

For six months in 2008 there were two new networked shows on the group, including the Saturday Afternoon show with Tim West (which not all stations took) and the Network Weekend Breakfast Show with Danny Mathews (previously on Capital Gold, Key 103, Century and the Magic Network). This was short-lived and, although the shows were well received by the audience / RAJAR, the shows&#x27; contracts were only six-months long and, due to the selling of many stations, these shows ceased in late 2008.

Former networked shows, such as the evening music and comedy show &quot;Simon James and Hill&quot; and late-night phone-in &quot;North-South Divided&quot; (which was broadcast jointly from studios in London and Durham to pitch listeners in the South of England against those in the North), were dropped in favour of more music-based shows that reflected the daytime sound of the TLRC stations. For a time, Sunday afternoons across the network were dedicated to a premium rate phone-in show hosted by Andy Muir, titled &quot;Money on your Mobile&quot;.

Network shows were mostly broadcast from Mix 107 in High Wycombe, although they also sometimes came from the alternative network centres at Isle of Wight Radio or Minster FM in York.

In 2005, TLRC made a large number of acquisitions including full control of east Lancashire station 2BR and Bath FM. New licences, Durham FM and Brunel FM, went on air in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In June 2007, TLRC launched Minster Northallerton which was moved into Alpha 103.2&#x27;s studio outside of the stations border in Darlington. Before selling them, the company had already moved Bath studios to neighbouring Brunel FM in Swindon.

In 2007, TLRC station Isle of Wight Radio won the Sony Radio Academy Award for Radio Station of the Year (under 300,000). In 2008, Silk FM won the same award, having been shortlisted the previous year.

In June 2008, TLRC announced plans to sell six of its stations, 3TR, Bath, Brunel, Ivel, Pennine and Vale, after selling loss-incurring Dune FM earlier in the month. This was followed by Central FM in September 2008. Also in 2008, TLRC made a licensing agreement with GMG Radio for three years to run the rebranded jazzfm.com service as Jazz FM on a number of DAB multiplexes, on digital satellite and on the Internet. The station went live on 6 October 2008, sharing studios with Mix 107 in High Wycombe.

On 7 January 2009, TLRC placed Jazz FM up for sale following a strategic review of the company. The station was sold to former chairman of TLRC, Richard Wheatly, on 9 April 2009 for £1.

In 2009, The Local Radio Company was acquired by UKRD and closed or disposed of long-term loss-making stations, as well as re-branding Alpha Radio, Minster Northallerton and Durham FM Into Star Radio North East. The Local Radio Company Limited was eventually dissolved in 2021.

<doc id="956371" wikidata="Q4770402" url="?curid=956371" title="Another World (M. C. Escher)">
<text>Another World II, also known as Other World II, is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in January 1947.

It depicts a cubic architectural structure made from brick. The structure is a paradox with an open archway on each of the five visible sides of the cube. The structure wraps around the vertical axis to enclose the viewer&#x27;s perspective. At the bottom of the image is an archway from which we seem to be looking up from the base, and through it we can see space. At the top of that arch is another arch which is level with our perspective, and through it we are looking out over a lunar horizon. At the top of that arch is another arch which covers the top of the image. We are looking down at this arch from above and through it onto the lunar surface.

Standing in each archway along the vertical axis is a metal sculpture of a bird with a humanoid face. In each side archway is a horn or cornucopia hanging on chains. The views from above and below are consistent, placing the statue so that it faces the horn; however, the horizontal view reverses the relative positions of the statue and the horn, and rotates the horn 180 degrees.

The three &quot;birds&quot; and three windows with horns hanging in them are not symmetrically arrayed as they might be if they depicted three mutually orthogonal vertical orientations. As is, the open wall we are looking through opens into a space with three different vertical orientations, but two of them are opposites of each other. Presumably, behind the picture&#x27;s overall point of view, the same landscape continues behind the viewer in the same orientation as we see it through the window opposite. Of course, from the point of view of the bird at the bottom, we are looking up from the floor and from the point of view of the bird at the top we are looking down through an open roof. Note that this asymmetry requires a further asymmetry to account for the fact that our point of view is not obviously that of another bird. In one wall two windows and horns with opposite vertical orientation share the same wall. In the wall opposite, there is only one window with a horn, which shares the verticality of the overall picture and of the bird opposite. Thus, if the point of view of the drawing is that of another bird, there are four birds and three horns, with one of them being shared between two birds with the same vertical orientation. In order to portray three mutually orthogonal verticalities from the point of view of a third bird, the bird opposite that would have to be rotated 90 degrees, and the window adjacent to the viewer show the naturally oriented landscape behind the hanging horn. 

The previous month (December 1946), Escher created a mezzotint called &quot;Another World (Other World Gallery)&quot;. The image in that print is the same as this one except that the arches continue on as an infinite corridor.

The bird/human sculpture is a real sculpture which was given to Escher by his father-in-law. This sculpture first appears in Escher&#x27;s 1934 lithograph &quot;Still Life with Spherical Mirror&quot;.

The picture is featured in the cover of the 1965 edition of Italo Calvino&#x27;s &quot;Cosmicomics&quot;.

<text>Eight Legged Freaks (originally titled Arac Attack, under which it was released in some parts of Europe and other countries around the world) is a 2002 monster comedy horror film directed by Ellory Elkayem and starring David Arquette, Kari Wuhrer, Scott Terra, Doug E. Doug, and Scarlett Johansson. The plot follows spiders that are exposed to mutagenic toxic waste, causing them to grow to colossal sizes and attack a small American mining town.

==Plot==
On a highway outside the quiet mining town of Prosperity, Arizona, a truck driver swerves to avoid a rabbit, causing a barrel of toxic waste to land in a pond. Crickets that feed from the pond are collected by an exotic spider farmer, Joshua Taft.

One week later, he shows Mike Parker, a local boy, his collection, including an enormous female orb-weaver spider from Brazil named Consuela. After Mike leaves, Joshua is bitten by an escaped tarantula and accidentally knocks down the spider cages. Joshua is killed by the spiders. After devouring him, the spiders grow to large proportions due to the toxins of the crickets Joshua fed them.

Another week later, Chris McCormick, whose father owned the mines before he died ten years ago, returns to Prosperity and stands against Wade, the mayor of Prosperity, about his proposition to sell the mine, as he believes that his father had discovered a gold vein in the mine. Chris also sparks a romance with Sam Parker, the town sheriff, and Mike&#x27;s mother, whose ex-husband was assaulted by Chris for infidelity, prior to his exile.

Wade holds a town meeting in the mall about whether they should sell the mines and relocate. Wade says Chris&#x27; father was delusional for thinking gold was in the mine. A grounded Mike sneaks out of his home and finds Joshua&#x27;s farm covered in webbing. He sees an enormous spider shadow in the mines and tells Chris that the spiders have grown to enormous sizes based on a giant spider leg he found at the mine entrance. Chris does not believe him, nor Sam, who extends his grounding.

As the entire town is connected in some way to the mines, spiders show up in many different places, abducting pets and animals, including Deputy Pete&#x27;s cat and Wade&#x27;s ostriches. Harlan Griffiths, an eccentric extraterrestrial enthusiast, is broadcasting his theory that they have been abducted by aliens. Ashley, Mike&#x27;s older sister, breaks up with her boyfriend and Wade&#x27;s troublemaking step-son Bret when he tries to seduce her aggressively. He and his motorcyclist friends are then chased by jumping spiders. Bret, the only survivor, accidentally cuts off the telephone line and ends up stuck in the mine. While traversing the mines, he finds Consuela feeding on victims who were trapped in spider webbing.

Chris finds out that his aunt Gladys and her dog are abducted by a male orb weaver in their basement upon finding a mass spider leg and shows it to Mike. Sam is convinced Chris and Mike are delusional but realizes they were right after witnessing a giant male orb weaver attempting to abduct Ashley and Chris. Sam kills the spider with a shotgun and tells Pete to bring all guns from the police station to her place. Ashley, Chris, Sam, and Mike escape to Harlan&#x27;s trailer, knowing it has a radio station. As Sam broadcasts the threat over the radio, a giant tarantula assaults the trailer, but they escape. As the town is besieged by vicious spider hordes, Sam tells everybody to evacuate to the mall. Wade flees into the mines and locks the gate before the attack, forcing the rest to defend themselves, only to be grabbed by the spiders himself. Harlan and Chris climb onto the roof, ascend the radio mast, and call the army, but are believed to be pranksters. Harlan jumps from the roof after the tarantula breaks open the gates, lets the spiders enter the mall, and lands in some bushes, where he meets Pete.

While the townsfolk are in the basement, Bret arrives on a forklift that brings down the locked gate, quickly reconciling with Ashley. They all head through the mines to the front entrance, discovering the methane-filled tunnels. After freeing Wade, Chris looks for Gladys, as well as learning from Sam that his father told her about Chris&#x27; exile as well as his feelings for her. He finds her and the gold vein his father discovered. They are confronted by the gigantic Consuela, but Chris uses perfume to distract Consuela and escapes on Bret&#x27;s motorcycle. Chris ignites the methane using Gladys&#x27;s cigarette matches, blowing up Consuela, her spider army, and the mall, leaving Wade completely distraught before the police arrive along with Pete and Harlan.

Chris reopens the mine, and Harlan delivers a radio report that the town has decided to cover up the whole incident, but let Harlan continue broadcasting about it. As Harlan concludes his broadcast, he gives off a toothy smile, revealing several golden teeth.

==Cast==
==Production==
Director Ellory Elkayem got the idea from his 1997 short film, &quot;Larger Than Life&quot;, which also handled a spider-fighting storyline.

The film was originally titled &quot;Arach Attack&quot; (under which it was released in some parts of Europe and other countries around the world) but the similarity to &quot;Iraq Attack&quot; made the title seem inappropriate after 9/11. The title &quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; is a line that Arquette ad-libbed in the movie: &quot;Get back, you eight-legged freaks!&quot;

The film was dedicated to the memory of several people: Lewis Arquette, father of David Arquette, who died in 2001 from heart failure, and Don Devlin and Pilar Seurat, the parents of producer Dean Devlin, who died of lung cancer in 2000 and 2001 respectively.

===Filming locations===
Prosperity is a fictional town in Arizona, though the film was actually shot in various locations in the state.
* The scenes inside Prosperity Mall were actually shot at Manistee Town Center, a closed mall in Glendale, Arizona. The mall was demolished a year after the shooting was completed and redeveloped; its demolition was featured in the film as a consequence of the tunnel&#x27;s methane gas explosion.
* The scenes in Aunt Gladys&#x27;s house in the kitchen and Gladys&#x27; basement were filmed at the Manistee Ranch in Glendale, directly adjacent to the mall itself.
* Some of the town scenes were shot in the old copper mining town of Superior, Arizona.
* The gas station scene was shot in Black Canyon City, Arizona.

===Spiders used in the film===
The following spiders were used in the film:
* Jumping spider
* Orb-weaver spider (Consuela &amp; male Orb-weavers)
* Tarantula
* Trapdoor spider
* Spitting spider
* Tiger Wolf spider

===Alternate credits===
====Alternate beginning====
The alternate beginning is an extended version in which Harlan does a broadcast promoting the mall after which Norman sees Wade approaching the driver of the toxic waste barrels before having the barrels put in the basement, directly in the mines.

====Alternate ending====
In the alternate ending after the mines are blown up, the townsfolk walk down a road to get help. They meet up with Pete and Harlan who were walking through the desert. Pete trying to convince Harlan the spiders were not aliens. Afterward, Sam and Chris kiss as the scene ends.

==Release==
The teaser trailer debuted in October 2001 attached to &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;. The film was originally going to be released on March 15, but the date was moved because of the competition of Fox’s family-friendly film &quot;Ice Age&quot;.

==Reception==

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 145 critics, with an average rating of 5.44/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;This homage to the B-movies of the &#x27;50s has a promising first half, but runs out of ideas in the second&quot;. On Metacritic the film has a score of 53% based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 3 out of 4 and wrote: &quot;Has laughs, thrills, wit, and scary monsters, and is one of those goofy movies like &quot;Critters&quot; that kids itself and gets away with it.&quot;

==Video game==
A video game adaptation titled &quot;Eight Legged Freaks: Let the Squashing Begin&quot; was released in 2002 for PC and Mac.

==Cancelled sequel==
On January 5, 2003, the movie news website Moviehole reported that &quot;Eight Legged Freaks 2&quot; was in development, but no additional information has come forth since then.

==Home media==
&quot;Eight Legged Freaks&quot; was released on VHS and on DVD in both widescreen and fullscreen edition formats on October 29, 2002. Shout! Factory released the film on Blu-ray for the first time on July 20, 2021.

<text>Richard de Grey (died c.1271) of Codnor, Derbyshire, was a landowner who held many important positions during the reign of Henry III of England, including Warden of the Isles (Channel Islands) 1226–1227, 1229–1230 and 1252–1254, and later both Constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1258 irregularly to 1264.

==Family==
Richard was born not later than 1198. He was the eldest surviving son of Henry de Grey of Thurrock, an Essex landowner owning the manors of Codnor in Derbyshire and Grimston in Nottinghamshire; and Isolda de Bardolf.

In the 6th year of the reign of King Richard I, his father, Henry de Grey was granted the manor of Thurrock in Essex, which was confirmed by King John. By 1201 he held the Manor of Codnor in Derbyshire, and in 1216 had been further granted the Manor of Grimston. Henry de Grey married, in about 1185, Isolda, a daughter of Robert Bardolf, Richard&#x27;s mother.

Richard de Grey married Lucy, the daughter and heir of John de Humez.

His eldest son, John, was born about 1225, and died on 5 January 1272, shortly after his father. John married Lucy, the daughter of Sir Reynold de Mohun of Dunster.

John&#x27;s eldest son was Henry de Grey (c.1255 – 1 September 1308), of Codnor, Derbyshire; Grays Thurrock, Essex; and Aylesford and Hoo, Kent.

Henry campaigned in Gascony in 1294–1297, and was with Edward I at the siege of Caerlaverock in 1300. Henry campaigned in Scotland as late as 1306.

Henry was called to Parliament and was therefore later deemed to have been the 1st Baron Grey of Codnor, but this claim was disallowed on review in 1989. Henry married Eleanor de Redvers, daughter of Hugh de Courtenay, the 1st Earl of Devon. Their daughter Lucia married a son of Roger de Somerie and their daughter Agnes married Sir William Fitzwilliam of Emley and Sprotborough, one of the barons executed after the Battle of Boroughbridge.

<text>Mel Stitzel (January 9, 1902 – December 31, 1952) was a German-born pianist best known for his work with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings, a leading jazz band of the early 1920s. The leading members of the group including cornetist Paul Mares, trombonist George Brunies and clarinet player Leon Roppolo were school friends from New Orleans who recruited others such as Stitzel and drummer Gene Krupa to join their band. Stitzel also played with The Bucktown Five in the early 1920s.

==Background==

At first, the band was known as the Friar&#x27;s Society Orchestra after forming to play a gig in Chicago at Friar&#x27;s Inn, but changed their name to the New Orleans Rhythm Kings after their lengthy residency ended. All of the members of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings at the time of their recording session of March 1923 – Mares, Roppolo, Brunies, Stitzel, and drummer Ben Pollack – are credited as co-writers of one of the band&#x27;s best-known songs: &quot;Tin Roof Blues,&quot; which was used as the basis for &quot;Make Love to Me,&quot; a million-seller for Jo Stafford in 1954. The band also recorded with pianist Jelly Roll Morton in one of the first multi-racial recordings in jazz.

Stitzel co-wrote &quot;Doodle Doo Doo&quot; with Art Kassel in 1924. He co-wrote &quot;Bittersweet&quot; with Ben Pollack. He also wrote the music for &quot;The Chant&quot; in 1926 after the Rhythm Kings broke up in 1925.

From 1958 to 1959, Ames guest starred on &quot;Telephone Time&quot;, &quot;Trackdown&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Man Without a Gun&quot;, &quot;Lassie&quot;, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, and &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot;. In her only regular role on primetime television, Ames played Policewoman Sandy McAllister on &quot;The Lineup&quot; in the series&#x27; final season in 1959.

She played Alice Hainline in the Western film &quot;Gunfighters of Abilene&quot; (1960), co-starring with Buster Crabbe and Barton MacLane. Ames guest starred on &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Stagecoach West&quot;, &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, and &quot;Ben Casey&quot;.

===1964-2015: &quot;General Hospital&quot;===

On February 23, 1964, Ames debuted on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, playing Audrey Hardy (then known as Audrey March). Ames was initially put on contract for only thirteen weeks because Audrey was dying from lymphoma. Her performance was well received by the show&#x27;s producers and the illness was eventually forgotten. Ames&#x27; tenure in the role became the longest running in the network&#x27;s history, spanning five decades. The character, a registered nurse, was paired romantically with Dr. Steve Hardy (John Beradino). When Audrey and Steve were married, Ames&#x27; father, Byron Foulger, played the priest who performed the ceremony. 

During her time on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Ames had an uncredited role as Dr. Parkington&#x27;s Nurse in the thriller film &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gone A-Hunting&quot; (1969), co-starring with her husband, Barry Cahill. The same year, she guest starred on &quot;Ironside&quot; and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. 

In 1974, Ames was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her work on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. She was nominated again in the same category in 1975. In 1979, she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. 

In 1997, she appeared as Audrey Hardy on ABC&#x27;s special two-hour primetime preview of a new daytime soap opera &quot;Port Charles&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Ames had a recurring role as Audrey on &quot;Port Charles&quot; from 1997 to 1998.

Her contract was not renewed for &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 2003, but she still appeared as a recurring character. In 2004, Ames was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 31st Daytime Emmy Awards ceremony at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In 2007, Ames retired from &quot;General Hospital&quot; after 43 years. She made a return appearance as Audrey on October 20, 2009, after a two-year absence from the show. 

Ames returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary on March 29, 2013. She reprised the role of Audrey again for one episode on October 30, 2015.

==Personal life==
Ames married Jack Genung on January 31, 1952, in Los Angeles. They had one daughter. 

She married her second husband, Canadian-born actor Barry Cahill in June 1968. They had a daughter and two grandchildren. Cahill died in April 2012. They had been married for 42 years.

<text>The Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (French: &quot;Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d&#x27;ARmement&quot;; OCCAR) is a European intergovernmental organisation that facilitates and manages collaborative armament programmes through their lifecycle between the governments of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

==History==

OCCAR was established on 12 November 1996 by the Defence Ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Legal status was not achieved, however, until January 2001 when the parliaments of the four founding states ratified the OCCAR Convention. Other European nations may join OCCAR, subject to their actual involvement in a substantive collaborative equipment programme involving at least one OCCAR partner and ratification of the OCCAR Convention. Belgium and Spain joined the organisation in respectively 2003 and 2005.

Other states can participate to OCCAR programmes without becoming a member state. Currently the European Union member states and/or NATO members Turkey, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania and Poland participate in one or more OCCAR programmes without being formal members. Australia also participates in OCCAR as a non-member with a focus on the Boxer, Tiger ARH and MU-90 Impact platforms. 

In 2023 Australia became the first non-European country to act as a participating state as part of OCCAR when it signed onto the MU-90 In-service support program. In November 2023 the Netherlands voiced its intention to join OCCAR.

==Structure==
The highest decision-making body within OCCAR as corporate organisation is the Board of Supervisors (BoS). Each OCCAR programmes is supervised by a Programme Board (strategic decisions) and a Programme Committee (operational decisions). The programmes are executed by the OCCAR Executive Administration (OCCAR-EA) in accordance with the decisions of the supervisory bodies. OCCAR-EA is headed by the OCCAR Director (Joachim Sucker since Feb 2023) and consists of a Central Office and the Programme Divisions. OCCAR-EA employs over 300 staff members.

==Current programmes==
The 16 programmes currently managed by OCCAR are the following: 

=== Aircraft ===
* Airbus A400M Atlas turboprop military transport aircraft
* Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter
* Eurodrone or European Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (MALE RPAS)

==Career==
Padgham became interested in record production after listening to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;. He started out as a tape operator at Advision Studios, working on many recording sessions including Mott The Hoople and Gentle Giant. From there he went to Lansdowne Studios and moved from tape-operator/assistant engineer to engineer. In 1978, Padgham got a job at The Townhouse, where he engineered and/or produced acts including XTC, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. He also worked on the second album by Killing Joke.

Padgham&#x27;s previous work with Gabriel and Collins led to a collaboration with Genesis and Phil Collins in the 1980s, which produced the albums: &quot;Face Value&quot;, &quot;Abacab&quot;, &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot;, &quot;Genesis&quot;, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; and &quot;...But Seriously&quot;. In addition to his work with Genesis and XTC, Padgham co-produced two albums with the Police: &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; and &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, as well as some of Police frontman Sting&#x27;s solo work. He also worked on Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Press to Play&quot; and the Human League&#x27;s &quot;Hysteria&quot;.

In the 2000s, Padgham worked with Sting as well as McFly. He had four UK number one hits in 2005 and 2006 with McFly, as well as a number of other Top Ten Singles. In 2002, Padgham produced the Tragically Hip album &quot;In Violet Light&quot;.

In 2019, Padgham was honoured in London with the MPG Award for Outstanding Contribution to UK Music.

Padgham is one of the owners of the indie label Gearbox Records.

== The &quot;gated drum&quot; sound ==

Padgham is credited with creating the &quot;gated reverb&quot; drum sound used so prominently on Phil Collins&#x27; single &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, and which became the template for much of the recorded pop drum sound of the 1980s. The effect is believed to have first been used on the 1980 third self-titled solo album by Peter Gabriel, which Padgham engineered and on which Collins played. At this time, Padgham was working regularly as the recording engineer for noted UK producer Steve Lillywhite, and they collaborated on many well-known albums and singles in the early 1980s.

Padgham&#x27;s gated drum effect is created by adding a large amount of heavily compressed room ambience to the original drum sound, and then feeding that reverb signal through an electronic device known as a noise gate. This unit can be programmed to cut off any signal fed through it, either after a specified time interval (in this case, some tens of milliseconds), or when the incoming signal falls below a preset gain threshold. The result is the arresting &#x27;gated reverb&#x27; effect, in which the reverberation cuts off abruptly, rather than fading away.

In a 2006 interview, Padgham revealed how the effect was first engineered:
The whole thing came through the famous &quot;listen mic&quot; on the SSL console. The SSL had put this massive compressor on it because the whole idea was to hang one mic in the middle of the studio and hear somebody talking on the other side. And it just so happened that we turned it on one day when Phil [Collins] was playing his drums. And then I had the idea of feeding that back into the console and putting the noise gate on, so when he stopped playing it sucked the big sound of the room into nothing.

<doc id="956411" wikidata="Q3142516" url="?curid=956411" title="Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk">
<text>Hugh Bigod ( – 18 February 1225) was a member of the powerful early Norman Bigod family and was for a short time the 3rd Earl of Norfolk.

==Origins==
 He was born c. 1182, the eldest son of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk by his wife Ida de Tosny.

== Career ==

In 1215, he was one of the twenty-five sureties of Magna Carta of King John. He succeeded to his father&#x27;s estates (including Framlingham Castle) in 1221.

==Marriage and children==

In late 1206 or early 1207, Hugh married Maud Marshal (1192 – 27 March 1248), daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1147–1219), Marshal of England, by his wife Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembroke. They had four, or possibly five, children: 
* Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk (–1270), died childless.
* Hugh Bigod (1211–1266), Justiciar of England. Married Joan de Stuteville, by whom he had issue.
* Isabel Bigod (c. 1212–1250), married twice: Firstly to Gilbert de Lacy (son of Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath and his wife Margaret de Braose), by whom she had issue; Secondly to John FitzGeoffrey, Lord of Shere, Justiciar of Ireland, by whom she had issue, including Maud FitzJohn, and Joan FitzJohn who married Theobald le Botiller, and from whom descended the Irish Earls of Ormond.
* Ralph Bigod (born c. 1215)

Contrary to the assertion of Frederick Lewis Weis, &quot;Ancestral Roots&quot;, there is no evidence for a fourth son called Simon Bigod. A man of that name appears as a witness to one of Earl Hugh&#x27;s charters (Morris, HBII 2), but as the eighteenth name in a list of twenty, suggesting no close connection to the main branch of the family. He is also named among the knights who surrendered to King John at Framlingham Castle in 1216. He was probably a descendant of Hugh or William Bigod, half-brothers to Earl Roger II Bigod.

Simon is recognized as the third son of Hugh Bigod in Francis Blomefield&#x27;s &quot;North Erpingham Hundred: Felbrigg&quot;. He is also recognized by Gary Boyd Roberts in &quot;The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies or the United States&quot;, Vol 1, p. 528.

==Death==
Hugh died on 18 February 1225. Very soon after Hugh&#x27;s death, his widow Maud remarried William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey.

==Hugh Bigod in fiction==
Hugh Bigod and his wife [Mahelt] are the main characters in Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;To Defy a King&quot;. They also appear as secondary characters in novels chronicling their parents such as &quot;The Time of Singing&quot; (UK: Sphere, 2008) published in the USA as &quot;For the King&#x27;s Favor&quot;; &quot;The Greatest Knight&quot;; and &quot;The Scarlet Lion&quot;.

<text>Constant Permeke (; 31 July 1886 – 4 January 1952) was a Belgian painter and sculptor who is considered the leading figure of Flemish Expressionism.

==Biography==
Permeke was born in Antwerp but when he was six years old the family moved to Ostend. Here his father, a landscape painter, founded in 1893 the Municipal Museum of Arts of which he became the curator. Permeke studied at the Bruges Academy from 1903 to 1906 and then at the Academy in Ghent from 1906 to 1908. Here he met Frits Van den Berghe and the brothers Gustave De Smet and Léon De Smet. He was drafted into the Belgian army and served in a university company that was quartered in Sint-Martens-Latem. After his military service ended in March 1908, Permeke returned to Ostend where he roomed together with Gustave De Smet. In 1909 he returned to Sint-Martens-Latem where he lived as a recluse. His work of this period is characterized by his heavy brush and gains its expressive force through muted tonality and brutal forms. In 1912 Permeke married Maria Delaere and the newlyweds settled in Ostend.
When World War I broke out, Permeke was mobilized. During the defense of Antwerp he was wounded in action near the town of Duffel. His wounds forced his evacuation to the United Kingdom where he was in hospital at South Hillwood. After his release from hospital he was reunited with his family in Folkestone, where his son John was born. In 1916 he moved to Chardstock in Devonshire and started painting again, mostly colorful English landscapes. After the end of the war, the Permeke family returned to Ostend in 1919. In contrast to the happy time in Devonshire, the harsh reality of the worker&#x27;s life turned Permeke&#x27;s work back to a gloomier mood as he mainly painted the harsh fisherman&#x27;s life.

In 1921 Permeke was able to exhibit his work in Antwerp and in Paris. Between 1922 and 1924, Permeke regularly went to Astene, in order to cooperate with Frits Van den Berghe. In 1926 Permeke went to Vevey in Switzerland where he mainly painted mountain scenes. In 1929 he moved to Jabbeke. During this period he changed his subject: instead of the fisherman and the sea he now focused on the farmer and his land. During this period, Permeke was enormously productive with works like &quot;Gouden Oogst&quot; (1935), &quot;De Grote Marine&quot; (1935), &quot;Moederschap&quot; (1936), &quot;Het Afscheid&quot; (1948), &quot;Dagelijks Brood&quot; (1950). Starting in 1937 Permeke tried his hand at sculpting as well. As a sculptor, Permeke tried to isolate the human figure in monumental efforts. &quot;De Zaaier&quot; (1939), &quot;Niobe&quot; (1946) and &quot;De Drie Gratiën&quot; (1949) are good examples of this period.
During World War II, Permeke was forbidden to paint by the German occupiers as his art was seen by them as &quot;Entartete Kunst&quot;. Privately, things were even worse as his son Paul was arrested and sent to Germany as a forced labourer. After the war, Permeke was appointed director of the National higher Institute and of the Royal Academy in Antwerp but after only one year he offered his resignation. In 1947–48, Permeke had a big retrospective exhibition in Paris but his happiness at the return of his son was soon shattered when in 1948 his wife died. Emotionally scarred and ailing, Permeke had to be nursed by his daughter.

During the last period of his life his work mellowed somewhat as it shows much more refinement in drawing and colors. His last works are &quot;De dame met de rode handschoenen&quot; (1951) and some landscapes painted in Brittany. After his trip to there in 1951, his health declined even further and he became bedridden.

Constant Permeke died on 4 January 1952. Four days later he was buried next to his wife at the cemetery in Jabbeke. On the grave of his beloved wife was placed a statue which Permeke had commissioned from his friend George Minne.
== Honours ==
* 1922: Officer in the Order of Leopold.

== Commemoration ==
In 1997, Belgium recognized Permeke&#x27;s achievements by having his portrait and one of his works imprinted on the 1,000 Belgian franc bill.

<doc id="956427" wikidata="Q931226" url="?curid=956427" title="Pocari Sweat">
<text>is a Japanese sports drink, manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical. It was launched in 1980, and is mostly well known across Asia and the Middle East; it is also available in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, Mexico and the United States.

Pocari Sweat is a mild-tasting, relatively light , non-carbonated sweet beverage and is advertised as an &quot;ion supply drink&quot;, &quot;refreshment water&quot; (1992), &quot;body request&quot; (1999), and &quot;electrolyte beverage&quot; in Thailand. It has a mild grapefruit flavor with little aftertaste. Ingredients listed are Sugar (Japan-processed), high fructose corn syrup, fruit juice, salt / acidulant, fragrance, potassium chloride, calcium lactate, flavor enhancer (amino acids), magnesium chloride, antioxidants (vitamin C) It is sold in aluminium cans, PET bottles, and as a powder for mixing with water. An artificially sweetened version with reduced sugar called is also sold.

== History ==
Pocari Sweat was launched in 1980 in Japan by Rokuro Harima, an Otsuka Pharmaceutical employee who came up with the idea after observing a doctor drink IV solution to rehydrate. Harima had taken a trip to the hospital after getting diarrhea during a business trip to Mexico, and wondered if a drink could provide both the water and nutrients he needed to recover.

Wary of Gatorade&#x27;s dominance of the United States market, Pocari Sweat focused on expansion into Asia and the Middle East. In 1982, it was exported overseas for the first time, to Hong Kong and Taiwan, followed the next year by Singapore, Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia. By the mid-1990s, Pocari Sweat had become Japan&#x27;s first domestically produced non-alcoholic drink to ship over $1 billion in product.

== Name ==
The reference to sweat in the name of the beverage might have a somewhat off-putting or mildly humorous connotation for some English speakers. However, the name was chosen by the manufacturers originally for the purpose of marketing the product as a sports drink in Japan, where English words are used differently. It was largely derived from the notion of what it is intended to supply to the drinker: all of the nutrients and electrolytes lost when sweating. The first part of the name, &quot;Pocari&quot;, gives a refreshing impression. Otsuka Pharmaceutical&#x27;s website states: Pocari&#x27; was named for its light nuance and bright sound, and it has no particular meaning.&quot;

== Marketing ==
Pocari Sweat has maintained the same blue-and-white color scheme since its inception in 1980. Originally sold in a 245 mL can, it has been sold primarily in bottle form since 1990.

Otsuka began a targeted marketing campaign in Indonesia after an outbreak of dengue fever in 2010, promoting the drink to prevent dehydration, a common symptom of the disease.

On 15 May 2014, Pocari Sweat started a project to send a &quot;dream capsule&quot; to the Moon with the help of Quantum Aerospace. The capsule was made in the same shape as a Pocari Sweat can and filled with Pocari Sweat powder. It was intended to be the first commercial product advertised on the Moon. Originally scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in October 2015, it was flown on the Astrobotic Technology lander Peregrine that failed to reach the Moon and burned in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in January 2024.

The company also has done extensive advertising through anime. The technical director for the film &quot;Your Name&quot; helped create a 2019 anime-styled advertisement. Pocari Sweat released a January 2021 special episode of the &quot;Cells at Work!&quot; anime promoting the drink as a way to prevent heat stroke.

<doc id="956428" wikidata="Q919115" url="?curid=956428" title="Alex Raymond">
<text>Alexander Gillespie Raymond Jr. (October 2, 1909 – September 6, 1956) was an American cartoonist and illustrator who was best known for creating the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic strip for King Features Syndicate in 1934. The strip was subsequently adapted into many other media, from three Universal movie serials (1936&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, 1938&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&#x27;s Trip to Mars&quot;, and 1940&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot;) to a 1950s television series and a 1980 feature film.

Raymond&#x27;s father loved drawing and encouraged his son to draw from an early age. In the early 1930s, this led Raymond to become an assistant illustrator on strips such as &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot; and &quot;Tim Tyler&#x27;s Luck&quot;. Towards the end of 1933, Raymond created the epic &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; science fiction comic strip to compete with the popular &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; comic strip. Before long, &quot;Flash&quot; was the more popular strip. Raymond also worked on the jungle adventure saga &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; and spy adventure &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; concurrently with &quot;Flash&quot;, though his increasing workload caused him to leave &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; to another artist by 1935. He left the strips in 1944 to join the Marines, saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945, and was demobilized in 1946. Upon his return to civilian life, Raymond created and illustrated the much-heralded &quot;Rip Kirby&quot;, a private detective comic strip. In 1956, Raymond was killed in a car crash at the age of 46.

He became known as &quot;the artist&#x27;s artist&quot; and his much-imitated style can be seen on the many strips that he illustrated. Raymond worked from live models furnished by Manhattan&#x27;s Walter Thornton Agency, as indicated in &quot;Modern Jules Verne,&quot; a profile of Raymond published in the Dell Four-Color &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; #10 (1942), showing how Thornton model Patricia Quinn posed as a character in the strip.

Numerous artists have cited Raymond as an inspiration for their work, including comic artists Jack Kirby, Bob Kane, Russ Manning, and Al Williamson. George Lucas cited Raymond as a major influence for &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996. Maurice Horn stated that Raymond unquestionably possessed &quot;the most versatile talent&quot; of all the comic strip creators. He has also described his style as &quot;precise, clear, and incisive.&quot; Carl Barks described Raymond as a man &quot;who could combine craftsmanship with emotions and all the gimmicks that went into a good adventure strip&quot;. Raymond&#x27;s influence on other cartoonists was considerable during his lifetime and did not diminish after his death.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Raymond was born in 1909 in New Rochelle, New York; his parents were Beatrice W. (née Crossley) and Alexander Gillespie Raymond, Sr. The boy was raised in the Roman Catholic faith.

His father was a civil engineer and road builder who encouraged his son&#x27;s love of drawing from an early age, even &quot;covering one wall of his office in the Woolworth Building&quot; with his young son&#x27;s artwork. Raymond&#x27;s father died when he was 12, after which he felt that there was not as viable a future in art as he had hoped. He attended Iona Prep on an athletic scholarship. There, he played fullback on coach &quot;Turk&quot; Smith&#x27;s 1926 football team.

Raymond&#x27;s first job was as an order clerk in Wall Street. In the wake of the 1929 economic crisis he enrolled in the Grand Central School of Art in New York City and began working as a solicitor for a mortgage broker.

Approaching former neighbor Russ Westover, Raymond soon quit his job and by 1930 was assisting Westover on his &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot; comic strip. As a result, Raymond was &quot;introduced to King Features Syndicate&quot;, where he later became a staff artist, and for whom he would produce his greatest artwork.

Raymond was influenced by a variety of strip cartoonists and magazine illustrators, including Matt Clark, Franklin Booth, and John La Gatta. From late 1931 to 1933, Raymond assisted Lyman Young on &quot;Tim Tyler&#x27;s Luck&quot;, eventually becoming the ghost artist in &quot;1932 and 1933 ... [on] both the daily strip and the Sunday page&quot;, turning it &quot;into one of the most eye-catching strips of the time&quot;. Concurrently, Raymond assisted Chic Young on &quot;Blondie&quot;.

In 1933, King Features assigned him to do the art for an espionage action-adventure strip, &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot;, scripted by novelist Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond&#x27;s illustrative approach to that strip made him King Features&#x27; leading talent.

===Flash Gordon, Jungle Jim, and Secret Agent X-9===

Towards the end of 1933, King Features asked him to create a Sunday page that could compete with &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, a popular science fiction adventure strip that had debuted in 1929 and already spawned the rival &quot;Brick Bradford&quot; in 1933. According to King Features, syndicate president Joe Connolly &quot;gave Raymond an idea ... based on fantastic adventures similar to those of Jules Verne&quot;.

Alongside ghostwriter Don Moore, a pulp-fiction veteran, Raymond created the visually sumptuous science fiction epic comic strip &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. The duo also created the &quot;complementary strip, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, an adventurous saga set in South-East Asia&quot;, a topper which ran above &quot;Flash&quot; in some papers Raymond was concurrently illustrating &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot;, which premiered January 22, 1934, two weeks after the two other strips. It was &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; that would outlast the others, quickly &quot;develop[ing] an audience far surpassing&quot; that of &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;. &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, wrote Stephen Becker, &quot;was wittier and moved faster,&quot; so &quot;Buck&#x27;s position as America&#x27;s favorite sci-fi hero&quot;, wrote historian Bill Crouch Jr., &quot;went down in flames to the artistic lash and spectacle of Alex Raymond&#x27;s virtuoso artwork.&quot; Alex Raymond has stated, &quot;I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a white sheet of paper and dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once.&quot; A. E. Mendez has also stated that &quot;Raymond’s achievements are chopped into bite-sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond&#x27;s draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it&#x27;s just pretty pictures. Somehow or another, it&#x27;s OK for people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling. But for Raymond to study illustrators, well, that&#x27;s just not comics.&quot;

Debuting on January 7, 1934, Raymond&#x27;s first &quot;Flash&quot; strip introduced the &quot;world-famous polo player&quot;, improbably roped into a space adventure alongside love-interest Dale Arden and scientist Dr. Hans Zarkov. Transported by rocket to the planet Mongo, &quot;which was about to collide with Earth&quot;, the trio &quot;immediately became embroiled in the affairs of Mongo&#x27;s inhabitants—particularly those of its insidious warlord, Emperor Ming&quot;, who would become Flash Gordon&#x27;s nemesis throughout the franchise&#x27;s many incarnations.

Early in 1935, Hammett decided to depart as writer of &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; in order to pursue a career in Hollywood. While it has been presumed that Raymond took on the writing duties of the strip until a replacement could be found, biographer Tom Roberts instead believes that the strip was written by committee during editorial conference, a view R. C. Harvey believes is supported by the strips themselves. &quot;Saint&quot; author Leslie Charteris was hired to take over the writing of the strip in September 1935, but the pair would only collaborate on one storyline. By the end of 1935, &quot;the [work]load was too much for Raymond,&quot; who left &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; to artist , in order to devote more time to his meticulous Sunday pages.

Raymond&#x27;s work on &quot;X-9&quot; is said to particularly reach for &quot;the feel of the best pulp interior art of the time,&quot; a style that would evolve with his own so-called &quot;great flourishes&quot; and &quot;later blossom to full effect in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;&quot;. &quot;Under his pen,&quot; writes Maurice Horn, his Sunday pages &quot;became world famous (especially &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;).&quot; However, historian and critic R.C. Harvey argues that &quot;despite Raymond&#x27;s great talent as an illustrator, his deployment of the comic-strip medium (on &quot;X-9&quot;) was not very impressive.&quot; Harvey feels that Raymond&#x27;s work suffers in comparison to Milton Caniff&#x27;s contemporaneous work, with Raymond&#x27;s failings as a visual storyteller less noticeable on a weekly Sunday strip, where the space afforded played to his skills as an illustrator.
Raymond&#x27;s sensual artwork—for which the artist particularly &quot;studied popular illustrators,&quot; including pulp artist Matt Clark, whose work Raymond&#x27;s male figures particularly evoke—outshone its borders and &quot;attracted far more loyal readers than ... [the] rather contrived and unconvincing adventure stories&quot; his work depicted. Raymond swiftly became &quot;among the most highly-regarded—and most imitated—in all of comics&quot; for his work on the weekly strip, with Harvey declaring his work on the strip &quot;a technical virtuosity matched on the comics pages only by Harold Foster in &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;.&quot; Raymond evolved the layout of the strip from a four-tier strip in 1934 to a two-tier strip in 1936, reducing the number of panels but doubling their size. Combining this with a removal of dialogue from speech balloons to captions at the bottom of the panel afforded Raymond the space to create detailed and atmospheric backgrounds. Against these spacious backgrounds, the placement of characters in heroic poses &quot;lent the entire enterprise a mythic air.&quot;

&quot;Flash Gordon&quot; gained a daily strip in 1940, illustrated by Austin Briggs. Raymond left the Sunday strip in 1944 to join the Marines, whereupon the daily strip was cancelled and Briggs assumed the Sunday strip duties, continuing until 1948. Briggs was succeeded on the Sundays by Emanuel &quot;Mac&quot; Raboy, while the daily strip was revived in 1951 by Dan Barry. Barry also took over Sunday duties after Raboy&#x27;s death in 1967.

Run above &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; is described by Armando Mendez as &quot;a thing of beauty ... always more than just a topper or a shallow response to Hal Foster&#x27;s exquisite &quot;Tarzan&quot;&quot;. The companion strip evolved over time, morphing from an initial &quot;two tiers and up to six panels [layout], with speech balloons&quot; into &quot;a single row, of four very tall panels with declamatory text and static, vertical composition&quot;. Raymond&#x27;s skill and artistic dexterity, however, kept the storytelling constant and the artwork vibrant. &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; was &quot;set in contemporary times and the exotic Malay peninsula of islands, [but] was intended to hark back to the original tales of Kipling, Haggard and Burroughs&quot;.

===Military career===
Raymond took the war in Europe seriously enough to incorporate it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself involved in the conflict too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming &quot;restive about doing his duty&quot;, a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;/&quot;Jungle Jim&quot; pages to join the U.S. Marine Corps, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating &quot;I just had to get into this fight ... I&#x27;ve always been the kind of guy who gets a lump in his throat when a band plays the &#x27;Star Spangled Banner&#x27;&quot;.

Shortly thereafter, he &quot;was sent to Quantico for training in the curriculum of the Aviation Ground Officer&#x27;s School,&quot; and was soon producing &quot;posters and patriotic images from a government office in Philadelphia.&quot; His most famous image from this time is &quot;Marines at Prayer,&quot; which &quot;was destined to become a well-known and well-circulated image of Marines on a battlefield pausing for worship.&quot; Raymond also &quot;designed the official 1944 Marine Corps Christmas card.&quot; Desiring &quot;to get closer to the action,&quot; he then trained at the Marine Corps Air Station in Santa Barbara before serving in the Pacific Ocean theater &quot;on the 1945 cruise of the escort carrier USS &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot;.&quot; Treated by his fellow marines (who had been raised on &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;) as a celebrity, he was nonetheless seen as &quot;a down-to-earth fellow,&quot; and well liked. He saw &quot;a period of intense combat in June 1945,&quot; and was &quot;made an honorary member of VMTB-143 in August 1945.&quot; Raymond had, in May 1945, designed a squadron patch for the men of VMTB-143, after which the &quot;squadron adopted the new name &#x27;The Rocket Raiders&#x27;.&quot;

He was demobilized as a major in 1946. Upon his return, Raymond was unable to return to &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. King Features were not prepared to usurp Austin Briggs from the Sunday strip and pointed out that Raymond had left voluntarily to enlist. Relatives of Raymond recall the artist as resenting this decision, which left him feeling &quot;cast off with so little regard.&quot; However, King Features offered Raymond the opportunity to create a new strip.

===Rip Kirby===

Raymond&#x27;s &quot;police daily strip,&quot; named after its central character – J. Remington &quot;Rip&quot; Kirby – debuted on March 4, 1946, conceived (and initially scripted) by King Features editor Ward Greene. The plotting of the strips is harder to attribute, the scant evidence available supporting the notion that Raymond was more than simply an illustrator. However, as was relatively commonplace on such strips, published credit went to Raymond, whose name was the major selling feature; the artist even managed to gain a part-ownership deal with King Features and a better split of the profits than was usual. &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; was Raymond&#x27;s reintroduction to newspaper strips after the war, and he was quick to forge a new &quot;up-to-date&quot; style for the strip, while keeping ties to the audience he had built up with &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, and &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot;.

Running alongside the post-World War II reintegration of America&#x27;s military into civilian life, Rip (like Raymond) was &quot;an ex-Marine,&quot; who &quot;set himself up as a private detective&quot; a vocation tailor-made to provide daily thrills.

Described by Stephen Becker as &quot;modern and almost too intellectual&quot;, the strip eschewed many of the pulp fictional detective tropes (e.g. alcoholism, two-fisted assistants, and an assortment of interchangeable femmes fatale). Instead, &quot;[Rip] did more cogitating than fisticuffing, and smoked a leisurely pipe while he did it;&quot; &quot;had a frail, balding assistant ... instead of a two-fisted sidekick;&quot; &quot;had a steady girlfriend ... [and] [i]f that wasn&#x27;t enough, he even wore glasses! Rip &quot;lived and worked in a recognizable, glamorous, modern New York City on cases involving very human frailties and vice&quot;, and &quot;grew older as the strip progressed&quot;, a continuity advancement little seen in the strips of the time (although pioneered in &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot; and &quot;Mary Worth&quot;). Raymond noted the change in subject matter, commenting that &quot;I wanted to do something different and more down to earth.&quot;

Stylistically, &quot;Raymond turned to the Cooper Studio-Al Parker advertising style for inspiration, spurring a new generation of comic artists to follow a fresh direction&quot;, that of &quot;glorify[ing] contemporary post-War American life&quot;. Although the strip was published entirely in black and white, Raymond worked hard to add tone through artistic technique. &quot;Raymond nevertheless [colored] through his use of varying linework ... [creating] color through contrast&quot;. His new style was much imitated throughout the industry and became known as &#x27;the Raymond style&#x27;.

Circulation of the strip rose steadily, and it was the artist who was apportioned most of the praise – including being awarded the fourth Reuben Award in 1949. He also served as the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s president from 1950 until 1952, putting into place the committee structure responsible for overseeing the organization, and threw himself into championing the medium as an art form. Raymond profited in recognizability as well as financially, and continued on the strip until his untimely death in September 1956. His collaborator from 1952 was writer Fred Dickenson (who wrote the strip for a further 34 years), and he was succeeded artistically by magazine and Prize Publications&#x27; &quot;Young Romance&quot; illustrator John Prentice. Commentators have said that Prentice echoed the &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; artistic style, but lacked &quot;Raymond&#x27;s excellent design sense,&quot; although Prentice received praise for his work from the Raymond family. Prentice drew &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; until just before he died in 1999, the strip itself concluding a month later.

==Legacy==
In 1967, Woody Gelman reprinted in hardcover some of Raymond&#x27;s earlier comic strip work under his Nostalgia Press imprint. Regarded by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1974—alongside &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; author-illustrator Hal Foster—as &quot;some sort of genius&quot;, and described in Jerry Bails and Hames Ware&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in American Comic Books&quot; as &quot;[p]ossibly the most influential artist on early comic books&quot;, Raymond&#x27;s legacy as an artistic inspiration is immense. Harvey argued that it is because of Raymond and Foster that the illustrative style became the dominant one used for adventure strips. &quot;His work and Foster&#x27;s created the visual standard by which all such comic strips would henceforth be measured.&quot; Biographer Tom Roberts also believes Raymond&#x27;s work on &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; &quot;inspired all the soap opera style strips of the fifties and sixties&quot;. Roberts argues that strips such as &quot;Apartment 3-G&quot; &quot;can trace their origins to the success of Raymond&#x27;s strip&quot;. Although his work was rarely seen outside of the newspaper &quot;funny pages&quot;, as Raymond preferred to focus his energies on strip work, he also produced a number of &quot;illustrations for &quot;Blue Book&quot;, &quot;Look&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;&quot; as well as &quot;Esquire&quot;.

The &quot;heightened realism&quot; of Raymond&#x27;s photorealistic style has been &quot;chastised for making his pictures too realistic, too gorgeous for its own sake&quot;, although many commentators believe that this very method &quot;plunges the reader into the story&quot;. Raymond&#x27;s work has a &quot;timeless appeal,&quot; many aspects of which—including the use of feathering (a shading technique in which a soft series of parallel lines helps to suggest the contour of an object)—have inspired generations of cartoonists, his work becoming &quot;the raw material for the swipe files of future generations&quot;. His work on &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; is especially noted for its use of &quot;sophisticated black spotting&quot;, a technique Raymond used from c.1949 &quot;for pacing&quot; reasons. Fellow-cartoonist Stan Drake recalled that Raymond called his black areas &quot;pools of quiet&quot;, serving as they did &quot;as a pause for the viewer, something to slow the eye across the strip&#x27;s panels&quot;.

===Specific influences===
Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;influence on other cartoonists was considerable during his lifetime and did not diminish after his death&quot;. George Lucas has cited Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; as a major influence on his &quot;Star Wars&quot; films (which, cyclically, inspired the 1980 &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; film), while Raymond&#x27;s long shadow has fallen across the comics industry ever since his work saw print. Comics artists who have cited Raymond as a particularly significant influence on their work include Murphy Anderson, Jim Aparo, Matt Baker, Frank Brunner, John Buscema, Gene Colan, Dick Dillin, Lou Fine, José Luis García-López, Frank Giacoia, Bob Haney, Jack Katz, Everett Raymond Kinstler, Joe Kubert, Russ Manning, Mort Meskin, Sheldon Moldoff, Luis Garcia Mozos, Joe Orlando, Mac Raboy, John Romita Jr., Kurt Schaffenberger, Joe Sinnott, Dick Sprang and Alex Toth, among many others.

In particular, Raymond has been named as a key influence by many of the most influential and important comic book artists of all time. EC Comics-staple Al Williamson cites Raymond as a major influence, and is quoted as saying that Raymond was &quot;the reason I became an artist&quot;. Indeed, Williamson ultimately assisted on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strips in the mid-1950s, and &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; in the mid-1960s (all post-Raymond). Key Golden Age artists credit Raymond with influencing their work. The artistic creators of Batman (Bob Kane) and Superman (Joe Shuster) credit him (alongside Milton Caniff, Billy DeBeck and Roy Crane) as having had a strong influence on their artistic development. Decades later, the herald of the Silver Age (and co-creator of most of Marvel Comics&#x27;s pantheon of heroes), Jack &quot;King&quot; Kirby also credits Raymond, alongside fellow strip artist Hal Foster, as a particular influence and inspiration.

&quot;Cerebus&quot; creator Dave Sim has published a comic book since 2008 called &quot;glamourpuss&quot; which is an examination of Alex Raymond&#x27;s career (and the techniques of other photorealists like Stan Drake and Al Williamson) structured around a hypothetical storyline set during the last day of Raymond&#x27;s life.

===Personal life===
Raymond married Helen Frances Williams on December 31, 1930, with whom he had five children. The names of his three daughters—Judith, Lynne and Helen—were immortalized in that of Rip Kirby&#x27;s girlfriend, Judith Lynne &quot;Honey&quot; Dorian. The Raymonds also had two sons: Alan W. and Duncan. He was the great-uncle of actors Matt Dillon and Kevin Dillon. His younger brother, Jim Raymond, was also a cartoonist, and worked as assistant to Chic Young on &quot;Blondie&quot;.

===Death===
On September 6, 1956, a month before his 47th birthday, Raymond was killed in an automobile accident in Westport, Connecticut. He was driving fellow cartoonist Stan Drake&#x27;s 1956 Corvette at twice the speed limit when he hit a tree and was killed. In his biography, Roberts described the circumstances as a result of the weather. Raymond was driving the convertible with its top down when the rain started to fall. He decided to reach his destination quicker rather than stop the vehicle to put the top back up. The car crashed and Drake was thrown clear, but Raymond, who was wearing his seat belt to no avail, died instantly. Speculation surrounded the nature of his death. Drake and some others believed that Raymond was suicidal. Raymond had been involved in four automobile accidents in the month prior to his death. This led Drake to say that Raymond &quot;had been trying to kill himself&quot;. Author Arlen Schumer ascribed Raymond&#x27;s personal life as the motive for suicide. Schumer alleged that Raymond had been having affairs and that his wife was refusing to grant him a divorce. R. C. Harvey dismissed this motivation: &quot;Committing suicide strikes me as an odd way for a man of Raymond&#x27;s sophistication to react to his disappointment in romance&quot;. Harvey also noted that no mention of any alleged affairs appears in Tom Roberts&#x27;s biography, &quot;probably out of consideration to Raymond&#x27;s surviving family&quot;. Drake has also been quoted as speculating that Raymond &quot;hit the accelerator by mistake&quot;. Raymond was buried in St. John&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery in Darien, Connecticut.

==Awards==
Alex Raymond received a Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society in 1949 for his work on &quot;Rip Kirby&quot;, and he later served as president of the society in 1950 and 1951. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1996. He was inducted into the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 2014.

Maurice Horn calls Raymond &quot;one of the most celebrated comic artists of all time as the creator of four outstanding comic features (a feat unequaled to this day),&quot; noting that he &quot;received many distinctions and awards during his lifetime for his work, both as a cartoonist and as a magazine illustrator.&quot;

<text>Pharmaceutical marketing is a branch of marketing science and practice focused on the communication, differential positioning and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, like specialist drugs, biotech drugs and over-the-counter drugs. By extension, this definition is sometimes also used for marketing practices applied to nutraceuticals and medical devices.

Whilst rule of law regulating pharmaceutical industry marketing activities is widely variable across the world, pharmaceutical marketing is usually strongly regulated by international and national agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. Local regulations from government or local pharmaceutical industry associations like Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) can further limit or specify allowed commercial practices.

==To health care providers==
Marketing to health-care providers takes three main forms: activity by pharmaceutical sales representatives, provision of drug samples, and sponsoring continuing medical education (CME). The use of gifts, including pens and coffee mugs embossed with pharmaceutical product names, has been prohibited by PHRMA ethics guidelines since 2008.
Of the 237,000 medical sites representing 680,000 physicians surveyed in SK&amp;A&#x27;s 2010 Physician Access survey, half said they prefer or require an appointment to see a rep (up from 38.5% preferring or requiring an appointment in 2008), while 23% won&#x27;t see reps at all, according to the survey data. Practices owned by hospitals or health systems are tougher to get into than private practices, since appointments have to go through headquarters, the survey found.
13.3% of offices with just one or two doctors won&#x27;t see representatives, compared with a no-see rate of 42% at offices with 10 or more doctors.
The most accessible physicians for promotional purposes are allergists/immunologists – only 4.2% won&#x27;t see reps at all – followed by orthopedic specialists (5.1%) and diabetes specialists (7.6%). Diagnostic radiologists are the most rigid about allowing details – 92.1% won&#x27;t see reps – followed by pathologists and neuroradiologists, at 92.1% and 91.8%, respectively.

E-detailing is widely used to reach &quot;no see physicians&quot;; approximately 23% of primary care physicians and 28% of specialists prefer computer-based e-detailing, according to survey findings reported in the 25 April 2011 edition of American Medical News (AMNews), published by the American Medical Association (AMA).

===PhRMA Code===
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) released updates to its voluntary Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals on 10 July 2008. The new guidelines took effect in January 2009.

In addition to prohibiting small gifts and reminder items such as pens, notepads, staplers, clipboards, paperweights, pill boxes, etc., the revised Code:
# Prohibits company sales representatives providing restaurant meals to healthcare professionals, but allows them to provide occasional modest meals in healthcare professionals&#x27; offices in conjunction with informational presentations&quot;
# Includes new provisions requiring companies to ensure their representatives are sufficiently trained about applicable laws, regulations, and industry codes of practice and ethics.
# Provides that each company will state its intentions to abide by the Code and that company CEOs and compliance officers will certify each year that they have processes in place to comply.
# Includes more detailed standards regarding the independence of continuing medical education.
# Provides additional guidance and restrictions for speaking and consulting arrangements with healthcare professionals.

===Free samples===
Free samples have been shown to affect physician prescribing behavior. Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications. Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow the standard of care practices.

Receiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.

It is argued that a benefit to free samples is the &quot;try it before you buy it&quot; approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away. It also saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a pharmacy.

===Continuing medical education===
Hours spent by physicians in industry-supported continuing medical education (CME) is greater than that from either medical schools or professional societies.

===Pharmaceutical representatives===
Currently, there are approximately 81,000 pharmaceutical sales representatives in the United States pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200–300 physicians with 120–180 targets that should be visited in 1–2 or 3 week cycle.

Because of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality. Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness. Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.

The United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians. The number and persistence of pharmaceutical representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians. &quot;As the number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with doctors went down—so far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis. Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem.&quot;

Marketers must decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see them) for each individual physician, how many patients with that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, their business potential, and event their personality traits.

Marketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by drug reps &#x27;on the ground&#x27; using zip code sales and engaging in recon to figure out who the high prescribers were in a particular sales territory. However, in the mid-1990s the industry, through third-party prescribing data (e.g., Quintiles/IMS) switched to &quot;script-tracking&quot; technologies, measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then &quot;deciled&quot; into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:
* Profitability of a prescription (script)
* Accessibility of the physician
* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company&#x27;s drugs
* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug
* The adoption sequence of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments)
* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs
* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.

Physicians are perhaps the most important component in sales. They write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by people. Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales. Historically, by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A medium-sized pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000 representatives. The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly, providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently tablets. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.

=== Pharmaceutical Company Payments ===
Pharmaceutical and medical device companies have also paid physicians to use their drugs, which could affect how often a drug is prescribed. For example, one study that looked at physician payments and pimavanserin found that &quot;extensive physician payments have been associated with increased pimavanserin prescription volume and Medicare expenditures.&quot;

More specifically, drug reps help to create a culture of gifting, or the &quot;pharmaceutical gift exchange,&quot; where actual monetary transactions are rare. In reality, gifts, both large and small, ranging from cups of coffee to travel to medical conferences are exchanged on a routine basis with high prescribers in an effort to shift their obligations from patients to prescriptions and have proven effective.

===Peer influence===
;Key opinion leaders
Key opinion leaders (KOL), or &quot;thought leaders&quot;, are respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback. 

Some pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct inquiry of physicians (primary research). Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use social network analysis to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.

;Colleagues
Physicians acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues, including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.
Doctor dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire educational information from respected peers and to influence the so-called &quot;no-see&quot; physicians - those that are reluctant to engage directly with pharmaceutical reps through detailing but may come to a dinner program where a local or national expert is talking. These meetings are sponsored by some pharmaceutical companies.

===Journal articles and technical documentation===

Legal cases and US congressional hearings have provided access to pharmaceutical industry documents revealing new marketing strategies for drugs. Activities once considered independent of promotional intent, including continuing medical education and medical research, are used, including paying to publish articles about promoted drugs for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results.

===Private and public insurers===
Public and private insurers affect the writing of prescriptions by physicians through formularies that restrict the number and types of drugs that the insurer will cover. Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its Medicare program. Known as Medicare Part D, this program engages private insurers to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.

==To consumers==
Only two countries as of 2008 allow direct to consumer advertising (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand. Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States. It takes two main forms: the promotion or creation of a disease out of a non-pathologic physical condition or the promotion of a medication. The rhetorical objective of direct-to-consumer advertising is to directly influence the patient-physician dialogue. Many patients will inquire about, or even demand a medication they have seen advertised on television. In the United States, recent years have seen an increase in mass media advertisements for pharmaceuticals.
Expenditures on direct-to-users advertising almost quadrupled in the seven years between 1997 and 2005 since the FDA changed the guidelines, from $1.1 billion in 1997 to more than $4.2 billion in 2005, a 19.6% annual increase, according to the United States Government Accountability Office, 2006).

The mass marketing to users of pharmaceuticals is banned in over 30 industrialized nations, but not in the US and New Zealand, which is considering a ban. Some feel it is better to leave the decision wholly in the hands of medical professionals; others feel that users education and participation in health is useful, but users need independent, comparative information about drugs (not promotional information). For these reasons, most countries impose limits on pharmaceutical mass marketing that are not placed on the marketing of other products. In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. Canada&#x27;s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.

Reynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as Avastin and Opdivo, in the former case and statins in the latter.

===Drug coupons===
In the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide drug coupons to consumers to help offset the copayments charged by health insurers for prescription medication. These coupons are generally used to promote medications that compete with non-preferred products and cheaper, generic alternatives by reducing or eliminating the extra out-of-pocket costs that an insurers typically charge a patient for a non-preferred drug product. But sometimes coupons for brand-name drugs could potentially distort the market and leading to higher overall healthcare costs since they encourage the overuse of more expensive drugs over generic alternatives. Consumers often realize too late that the continued use of these drugs without coupons necessitates either switching to a cheaper generic or facing steep out-of-pocket expenses.

==Economics==
Pharmaceutical company spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research. In 2004 in Canada $1.7 billion a year was spent marketing drugs to physicians and in the United States $21 billion were spent in 2002. In 2005 money spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States was estimated at $29.9 billion with one estimate as high as $57 billion. When the US number are broken down 56% was free samples, 25% was detailing of physicians, 12.5% was direct to users advertising, 4% on hospital detailing, and 2% on journal ads. In the United States approximately $20 billion could be saved if generics were used instead of equivalent brand name products.

Although pharmaceutical companies have made large investments in marketing their products, overall promotional spending has been decreasing over the last few years, and declined by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010. Pharmaceutical companies are cutting back mostly in detailing and sampling, while spending in mailings and print advertising grew since last year.

==Regulation and fraud==

=== European Union ===

In the European Union, marketing of pharmaceuticals is regulated by EU (formerly EEC) Directive 92/28/EEC. Among other things, it requires member states to prohibit off-label marketing, and direct-to-consumer marketing of prescription-only medications.

=== United States ===

In the United States, marketing and distribution of pharmaceuticals is regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, respectively. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on &quot;substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience&quot;, to provide a &quot;fair balance&quot; between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.

In the 1990s, antipsychotics were &quot;still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses&quot;. Drugs such as Abilify and Geodon were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.

Every major company selling the drugs—Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Johnson &amp; Johnson—has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements in 2009 set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly&#x27;s antipsychotic Zyprexa, and the other involved Bextra. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, Geodon; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.

The following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement. Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.

==Evolution of marketing==
The emergence of new media and technologies in recent years is quickly changing the pharmaceutical marketing landscape in the United States. Both physicians and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target audiences.

In 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or medical device information—a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details. Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and Epocrates.

Direct-to-users marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television, radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, online display advertising, search engine marketing, social media campaigns, place-based media and mobile advertising to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.

In 2010, the FDA&#x27;s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.
