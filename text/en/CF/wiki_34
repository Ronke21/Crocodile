<text>A photo booth is a vending machine or modern kiosk that contains an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and film processor. Today, the vast majority of photo booths are digital.

== History ==

The patent for the first automated photography machine was filed in 1888 by William Pope and Edward Poole of Baltimore. The first known really working photographic machine was a product of the French inventor T. E. Enjalbert (March 1889). It was shown at the 1889 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. The German-born photographer Mathew Steffens from Chicago filed a patent for such a machine in May 1889. These early machines were not reliable enough to be self-sufficient. The first commercially successful automatic photographic apparatus was the &quot;Bosco&quot; from inventor Conrad Bernitt of Hamburg (patented July 16, 1890). All of these early machines produced ferrotypes. The first automatic photographic apparatus with negative and positive process was invented by Carl Sasse (1896) of Germany.

The modern concept of photo booth with (later) a curtain originated with Anatol Josepho (previously Josephewitz), who had arrived in the U.S. from Russia in 1923. In 1925, the first photo booth appeared on Broadway in New York City. For 25 cents, the booth took, developed, and printed 8 photos, a process taking roughly 10 minutes. In the first six months after the booth was erected, it was used by 280,000 people. The Photomaton Company was created to place booths nationwide. On March 27, 1927, Josepho was paid $1 million and guaranteed future royalties for his invention.

In the United Kingdom, entrepreneur Clarence Hatry established the Photomaton Parent Corporation, Ltd., in 1928.

==Operation==
After money has been inserted in the machine, multiple customers can enter the booth and pose for a set number of exposures. Some common options include the ability to alter lighting and backdrops while the newest versions offer features such as cameras from a variety of angles, fans, seats, and blue screen effects. Some establishments even offer costumes and wigs for customers to borrow.

Once the pictures have been taken, the customers select the pictures that they wish to keep and customize them using a touch screen or pen-sensitive screen. The touch screen then displays a vast array of options such as virtual stamps, pictures, clip art, colorful backdrops, borders, and pens that can be superimposed on the photographs.

Features that can be found in some sticker machines are customizing the beauty of the customers such as brightening the pictures, making the eyes sparkle more, changing the hair, bringing a more reddish color to the lips, and fixing any blemishes by having them blurred. Other features include cutting out the original background and replacing it with a different background. Certain backgrounds may be chosen so when the machine prints out the picture, the final sticker will be shiny with sparkles.

Finally, the number and size of the pictures to be printed are chosen, and the pictures print out on a glossy full-color 10 × 15 cm sheet to be cut up and divided among the group of customers. Some photo booths also allow the pictures to be sent to customers&#x27; mobile phones. Other photo places have a scanner and laptop at the cashier&#x27;s desk for customers to scan and copy their original picture before they cut and divide the pictures amongst their group.

==Types of photo booths==
=== Passport photo booths ===

Most of the photo booths are used for passport photos. They are coin-operated automated machines that are designed to print a photo in a specific format that meets the passport photo requirements. Multiple copies can be printed so users can save some for future uses.

Traditionally, photo booths contain a seat or bench designed to seat the one or two patrons being photographed. The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session. Once the payment is made, the photo booth will take a series of photographs, although most modern booths may only take a single photograph and print out a series of identical pictures. Before each photograph, there will be an indication, such as a light or a buzzer, that will signal the patron to prepare their pose. Most booths will use artificial lighting, which may be flash or continuous lighting. After the last photograph in the series (typically between 3 and 8) has been taken, the photo booth begins developing the film — a process that used to take several minutes in the old &quot;wet chemistry&quot; booths, but is now typically accomplished in about 30 seconds with digital technology. The prints are then delivered to the customer. Typical dimensions of these prints vary. The classic and most familiar arrangement from the old style photo booths is four pictures on a strip about 40 mm wide by 205 mm long; digital prints tend to have a square arrangement of two images above two images.

Both black and white and colour photo booths are common in the US, however in Europe the colour photo booth has almost entirely replaced black and white booths. However, newer digital booths now offer the customer the option of whether to print in colour or in black and white. Most modern photo booths use video or digital cameras instead of film cameras, and are under computer control. Some booths can also produce stickers, postcards, or other items with the photographs on them, rather or as well as simply a strip of pictures. These often include an option of novelty decorative borders around the photos.

===Photo sticker booths===
Photo sticker booths or photo sticker machines originated from Japan (see &quot;Purikura&quot; below). They are a special type of photo booth that produce photo stickers. Still maintaining huge popularity in Japan, they have spread throughout Asia to Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam, and Thailand. They have also been imported to Australia. Some have also begun appearing in the United States and Canada although they failed to make any impression in Europe when introduced in the mid-1990s.

===Purikura===

In Japan, refers to a photo sticker booth or the product of such a photo booth. The name is a shortened form of the registered Atlus/Sega trademark , the first &quot;purikura&quot; machine, introduced to arcades in 1995.

Purikura produce what are today called selfies. Purikura is essentially a cross between a traditional license/passport photo booth and an arcade video game, with a computer which allows the manipulation of digital images. It involves users posing in front of a camera within the compact booth, having their images taken, and then printing the photos with various effects designed to look &quot;kawaii&quot;. It presents a series of choices, such as desired backdrops, borders, insertable decorations, icons, text writing options, hair extensions, twinkling diamond tiaras, tenderized light effects, and predesigned decorative margins.

====History of purikura====
Purikura has roots in Japanese &quot;kawaii&quot; culture, which involves an obsession with beautifying self-representation in photographic forms, particularly among females. Purikura originate from the Japanese video game arcade industry. It was conceived in 1994 by Sasaki Miho, inspired by the popularity of girl photo culture and photo stickers in 1990s Japan. She worked for a Japanese game company, Atlus, where she suggested the idea, but was initially rejected. Atlus eventually decided to pursue Miho&#x27;s idea, and developed it with the help of a leading Japanese video game company, Sega, which later became the owner of Atlus. Sega and Atlus introduced &quot;Print Club&quot;, the first purikura, in February 1995, initially at game arcades, before expanding to other popular locations such as fast food shops, train stations, karaoke establishments and bowling alleys. &quot;Game Machine&quot; magazine listed &quot;Printing Club&quot; as Japan&#x27;s most successful arcade game in the non-video game category during early 1996, and it went on to become the overall highest-grossing arcade game of 1996 in Japan. By 1997, about 45,000 &quot;Purikura&quot; machines had been sold, earning Sega an estimated () or annually from &quot;Purikura&quot; sales that year. &quot;Print Club&quot; went on to generate over in sales for Atlus and Sega.

The success of the original Sega-Atlus machine led to other Japanese arcade game companies producing their own purikura, including SNK&#x27;s &quot;Neo Print&quot; in 1996 and Konami&#x27;s &quot;Puri Puri Campus&quot; (&quot;Print Print Campus&quot;) in 1997, with Sega controlling about half of the market that year. Purikura became a popular form of entertainment among youths in Japan, then East Asia, in the 1990s. To capitalize on the purikura phenomenon, Japanese mobile phones began including a front-facing camera, which facilitated the creation of selfies, during the late 1990s to early 2000s. Photographic features in purikura were later adopted by smartphone apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, including scribbling graffiti or typing text over selfies, adding features that beautify the image, and photo editing options such as cat whiskers or bunny ears.

=== 3D selfie photo booths ===
A 3D selfie photo booth such as the Fantasitron located at Madurodam, the miniature park, generates 3D selfie models from 2D pictures of customers. These selfies are often printed by dedicated 3D printing companies such as Shapeways. These models are also known as 3D portraits, 3D figurines or mini-me figurines.

===Different types of photo booths===
==Cultural significance of photo booths==
===Purikura===
Purikura offer rare insight into Japanese popular culture, specifically girl culture. Purikura is a social activity, rarely done alone. It is also now an established form of entertainment, with most Japanese having tried it at least once. The wide lexicon associated with purikura also reveals that it has grown outside kawaii culture; erotic purikura, creepy purikura, and couples purikura are all genres of this popular form of self-photography. Graffiti purikura, an alternative genre of purikura, represents young females&#x27; desire to rebel from traditional gender roles. In order to contradict stereotypical images of Japanese women as docile and meek, graffiti purikura photographers may photograph themselves in unflattering fashion or add stickers which defy cuteness, such as the poop emoji. Rather than simple conceited frivolity, purikura photography demonstrates ingenuity and creativity on the part of young Japanese women seeking forms of self-expression.

===Flinders Street Station photo booth===
Located at the Elizabeth Street exit of Melbourne&#x27;s busiest railway station, Flinders Street Station, lies a culturally significant photo booth. The photo booth has been continuously operating at the station since 1961, with many feeling it has become an iconic and irreplaceable part of the station. It has been maintained for the entirety of its life by owner Alan Adler. During May 2018, Mr Adler (then 86) was given 10 days notice to remove the photo booth by Metro Trains Victoria to make way for station upgrades. Alan informed passerby with a hand written note explaining the news prompting widespread backlash from the public and support for Alan and his photo booth. After a letter writing campaign to Metro Trains, Public Transport Victoria CEO Jeroen Weimar phoned Alan to apologise and assured him a new home would be found. Days later they successfully relocated the photo booth to another location within Flinders Street Station. The photo booth shoots analogue images in black and white and joins 3 images together vertically.

===Photo booths for parties===
Photo booth rental companies allow a person to rent a photo booth for a short period of time (usually in hours) for a fee. Photo booth rentals have become popular in the United States primarily for wedding receptions, sweet sixteen parties, Bar and Bat Mitzvah parties, along with a growing number of other public and private events. In addition to the photo booth and the printing of unlimited photo strips, rental companies usually include a photo booth attendant to service the photo booth and to help guests construct the guest book of photo strips. Online image hosting, compact discs containing the images and related merchandise are readily available. Celebrities are frequent users of photo booths in parties.
Apart from traditional photo printing, modern photo booths may also include the following new functions:
* Animated GIF
* Flip book printing
* Virtual props, placed intelligently on the person&#x27;s eyes or shoulders etc.
* Slow-motion video
* Green-screen background removal
* Fun costume virtual dressing
* Games - mostly Kinect body gesture controlled games, and print a photo of the person and his/her scores
* Facial gesture recognition

== Growth of photo booth rentals ==
As digital cameras, compact photo printers, and flat screen computer monitors became widely available in the early 2000s, people connected these together using a personal computer and software and created their own photo booths. Entrepreneurs began renting machines built along these lines at weddings and parties and the idea spread. From 2005 to 2012, interest in the United States for photo booth rentals grew significantly. By 2016, more people were searching for photo booth rentals than DJ rentals in 15 of North America&#x27;s largest cities. In Greater Los Angeles alone, there are now more than 600 photo booth rental companies. Photo booth rentals have also become popular in other countries such as Canada, Australia, and the UK. So far in 2016, there is an average of 226,000 monthly searches for a photo booth globally. This has risen by 48.9% since 2015 (in the UK alone this is nearly 20,000 searches a month).

<doc id="949727" wikidata="Q477999" url="?curid=949727" title="Mary Hunter Austin">
<text>Mary Hunter Austin (September 9, 1868 – August 13, 1934) was an American writer. One of the early nature writers of the American Southwest, her classic &quot;The Land of Little Rain&quot; (1903) describes the fauna, flora, and people of the region between the High Sierra and the Mojave Desert of southern California.

==Early years and education==

Mary Hunter Austin was born on September 9, 1868, in Carlinville, Illinois (the fourth of six children) to Susannah (née Graham) and George Hunter. She graduated from Blackburn College in 1888. Her family moved to California in the same year and established a homestead in the San Joaquin Valley.

==Career==
She married Stafford Wallace Austin on May 18, 1891, in Bakersfield, California. He was from Hawaii, a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, United States General Land Office employee, and, later, Potash War lawyer.

For 17 years, Austin made a special study of the lives of the indigenous peoples of the Mojave Desert. Her publications set forth the intimate knowledge she thus acquired. She was a prolific novelist, poet, critic, and playwright, as well as an early feminist and defender of Native American and Spanish-American rights.

Austin is best known for her tribute to the deserts of California, &quot;The Land of Little Rain&quot; (1903). Her play, &quot;The Arrow Maker&quot;, dealing with Indian life, was produced at the New Theatre, (New York) in 1911, the same year she published a rhapsodic tribute to her acquaintance H. G. Wells as a producer of &quot;informing, vitalizing, indispensable books&quot; in the &quot;American Magazine&quot;.

Austin and her husband were involved in the local California Water Wars, after which the water of Owens Valley eventually was drained to supply Los Angeles.

When the battle was lost, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Stafford moved to Death Valley, California and Mary relocated to the art colony at Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. There Austin was part of the cultural circle that included Jack London, Ambrose Bierce, Harry Leon Wilson, George Sterling, Nora May French, Arnold Genthe, James Hopper, Alice MacGowan, Joaquin Miller, Gelett Burgess, Sinclair Lewis, and Xavier Martinez. Two years after developing a friendship with Austin in 1904, Sterling enticed her to join him in Carmel. 

In 1906, she had a tree house constructed, that she called “Wick-i-up”, built by M.J. Murphy, based on a design by San Francisco architect Louis Christian Mullgardt. She wrote much of her writings from this tree house.. Austin hired Murphy in 1907 to create a Craftsman-style cottage she called &quot;Rose Cottage.&quot; The property is located at the intersection of 4th Avenue and Monte Verde Street. The cottage has gardens and two gates with paths leading to it. At this cottage, she entertained her friends, including London, Sterling, and Lewis. Today, the cottage is listed as the &quot;Mary Austin House&quot; with the Carmel Inventory Of Historic Resources, and was recorded with the Department of Parks and Recreation as significant under California register criterion as the home of one of the bohemian founders of the artist colony at Carmel.

Austin was one of the founders of the local Forest Theater, where in 1913 she premiered and directed her three-act play &quot;Fire.&quot; In July 1914, she joined William Merritt Chase, the distinguished New York painter who was teaching his last summer class in Carmel, at several society &quot;teas&quot; and privately in his studio, where he finished her portrait. The well-known artist Jennie V. Cannon reported that he began the painting as a class demonstration after Austin claimed that two of her portraits, which were executed by famous artists in the Latin Quarter of Paris, had already been accepted to the Salon. Apparently, Chase was not deterred by Austin&#x27;s &quot;pushiness and claims to extra-sensory perceptions&quot;, but was more interested in her appointment as director of East Coast publicity for San Francisco&#x27;s Panama–Pacific International Exposition. On July 25, 1914, Chase attended her Indian melodrama in the Forest Theater, &quot;The Arrow Maker&quot;, and confessed to Cannon that he found the play dreary. Apparently, Dr. Daniel MacDougal, head of the local Carnegie Institute, paid for most of her production costs, because of his not-so-secret love affair with the writer. In August 1914, one of Chase&#x27;s students, Helena Wood Smith, was brutally strangled and buried on the beach by her Japanese lover, art-photographer George Kodani, Austin joined the mob who disparaged local authorities for their incompetence. After 1914 her visits to Carmel were relatively brief.

After visiting Santa Fe in 1918, Austin helped establish The Santa Fe Little Theatre (still operating today as The Santa Fe Playhouse) and directed the group&#x27;s first production held February 14, 1919, at the art museum&#x27;s St. Francis Auditorium. Austin also was active in preserving the local culture of New Mexico, establishing the Spanish Colonial Arts Society in 1925 with artist Frank Applegate.

In 1929, while living in New Mexico, Austin co-authored a book with photographer Ansel Adams. Published a year later, the book, &quot;Taos Pueblo&quot;, was printed in a limited edition of only 108 copies. It now is quite rare because, rather than reproductions, it included photographs made by Adams.

Her home in Santa Fe, at 439 Camino del Monte Sol, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building in the Camino del Monte Sol Historic District.

==Death and legacy==
Austin died August 13, 1934, in Santa Fe. Mount Mary Austin, in the Sierra Nevada, was named in her honor. It is located 8.5 miles west of her long time home in Independence, California. A biography was published in 1939.
The Austin home in Independence, California, designed and built by the couple, became a California Historical Landmark.

A teleplay of &quot;The Land of Little Rain&quot; was written by Doris Baizley and presented on &quot;American Playhouse&quot; in 1989; it starred Helen Hunt. A 1950 edition of &quot;The Land of Little Rain&quot; and a 1977 edition of &quot;Taos Pueblo&quot; each included photographs by Ansel Adams.

<doc id="949728" wikidata="Q1564551" url="?curid=949728" title="Philadelphia Athletics (American Association)">
<text>The Philadelphia Athletics were a professional baseball team, one of six charter members of the American Association, a 19th-century major league, which began play in as a rival to the National League. The other teams were the Baltimore Orioles, Cincinnati Red Stockings, Eclipse of Louisville, Pittsburgh Alleghenys, and St. Louis Brown Stockings. The team took its name from a previous team, which played in the National Association from through and in the National League in .

==Overview==
Over the nine years of their existence, the Athletics were a successful club on the field, winning 633 games and losing 564, for a winning percentage of .529. The team won the AA pennant in , finishing one game ahead of the St. Louis team. That same year, however, the National League set up its own team in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Quakers (later Phillies). The Quakers finished last in 1883, but soon improved on the field and at the gate.

Their home games were played at Oakdale Park in 1882, and at the Jefferson Street Grounds from 1883 to 1890. In addition, games were also occasionally played at Gloucester Point Grounds. They had eight different managers, with co-owner Bill Sharsig having the longest tenure.

Notable players for the Athletics included future Baseball Hall of Fame member Wilbert Robinson and Al Atkinson. Atkinson is one of the few pitchers to throw more than one no-hitter, and he threw them both for the Athletics, on May 24, 1884 and May 1, 1886. In the first no-hitter Atkinson beaned leadoff hitter Ed Swartwood and then retired 27 batters in a row. In 1888 the Athletics had two no-hitters within a week, with Ed Seward throwing one on July 26 and Gus Weyhing on July 31.

== Beginnings ==
The Athletics were founded by businessman Bill Sharsig in September 1880. In 1881, the team went on a barnstorming tour, and Sharsig took on two partners: player Charlie Mason and manager Horace Phillips. After the tour, Phillips jumped ship to the competing Quakers and was replaced on the management team by minstrel show performer Lew Simmons.

==Success==
The Athletics were successful both on and off the field during the early part of their existence. After winning the AA in 1883, in 1884 it was said that Sharsig, Simmons and Mason had cleared between $200,000 and $300,000 in just three years, then the greatest financial success scored in baseball.

==Ownership shuffle==
After the 1887 season, Sharsig bought out Mason and Simmons, selling their shares of the club to H. C. Pennypacker and William Whittaker.

==Collapse of 1890==
The last straw for the AA Athletics, and several other American Association teams, was the creation of the Players&#x27; League in 1890. The established leagues lost players to the upstart league, player salaries soared (by the standards of the day), and there simply were not enough fans to support three baseball leagues. The Athletics also had problems with their own payroll, with the salaries of Pennypacker and Whittaker causing additional financial trouble.

Though the Players&#x27; League folded after a single season, it had taken its toll. In September 1890, the Athletics released or sold their players and finished the season with a pick-up team, losing the final 21 games. The Athletics were expelled by the league at the end of the season and was replaced by a new Philadelphia Athletics team, which previously played in the Players&#x27; League as the Quakers. The new team hired Sharsig as manager.

<doc id="949730" wikidata="Q1753461" url="?curid=949730" title="Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees">
<text>The Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (, TCO, literary &quot;White-collar workers&#x27; Central Organisation&quot;) is a national trade union centre, the umbrella organisation for 12 trade unions in Sweden that organise professional and other qualified employees in both the private and the public sectors. The affiliated trade unions represent about 1.2 million employees. In 2018, the TCO affiliated unions made up 37% of all active trade union members in Sweden (up from 17% in 1950), making the confederation the second largest of Sweden&#x27;s three major confederations. The largest TCO affiliate is Unionen with 551,000 active members in 2018. TCO is independent and not affiliated to any political party in Sweden. TCO is an affiliate of the European Trade Union Confederation and Eurocadres.

==History==
TCO is the product of two confederations that merged in 1944. The older organisation was the Confederation of Employees ( or DACO) founded in 1931 by seven private sector white collar unions representing 20,000 workers. The second organisation was the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees ( TCO) which was founded in January 1937 by eight public sector unions representing 38,000 workers. The two confederations merged in 1944, adopting the name TCO, bringing together 40 trade unions representing 180,000. After World War II membership in the affiliated unions grew rapidly to more than half a million by 1965.

==Affiliates and membership==

Union density in Sweden has been at one of the highest levels in the world, peaking around 85% in the mid-1980s, but since declining to around 70% in 2015. In general, the decline in union density in Sweden has been faster among blue-collar workers and slower among white-collar workers (TCO&#x27;s base of membership).

<text>Ely Jacques Kahn Jr. (December 4, 1916 – May 28, 1994) was an American writer with &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for five decades.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, he was the son of architect Ely Jacques Kahn, and the brother of mystery editor and anthologist Joan Kahn. He attended the Horace Mann School and Harvard University, where he took his B.A. in 1937. He was hired by St. Clair McKelway at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1937 and his first byline appeared there in the April 3, 1937 issue. Before World War II, he was drafted and served in the U.S. Army from 1941 to 1945. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; publishing 39 of his pieces on Army life that were later collected in book form.

His long career with the magazine resulted in numerous books on such varied subjects as Coca-Cola, Lesley J. McNair, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Harvard University, Herbert Bayard Swope, Frank Sinatra, Dwayne O. Andreas of Archer Daniels Midland, and the Postal Inspection Service. However, his multi-part series on grain, which was published in book form as &quot;Staffs of Life&quot; in 1985, was criticized by some as an example of the self-indulgent journalism that marked &quot;The New Yorker&quot; during the 1970s and &#x27;80s.

Kahn lived in Scarborough-on-Hudson, New York, for more than 20 years, and was a member of the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department. He taught writing at Columbia University from 1974 to 1977.

His book &quot;The New Yorker and Me&quot; (New York: G.P. Putnam&#x27;s, 1979) is a diary interspersed with memories of his life, the magazine, and its editor William Shawn—whom Kahn calls &quot;The Iron Mouse.&quot; His 1987 diary was released as &quot;Year of Change: More about the New Yorker and Me&quot; (New York: Viking, 1988).

==Death==
Kahn died in a traffic accident on May 28, 1994, in Holyoke, Massachusetts, at the age of 77.

<doc id="949737" wikidata="Q3374661" url="?curid=949737" title="Pendle Hill">
<text>Pendle Hill is in the east of Lancashire, England, near the towns of Burnley, Nelson, Colne, Brierfield, Clitheroe and Padiham. Its summit is above mean sea level. It gives its name to the Borough of Pendle. It is an isolated hill in the Pennines, separated from the South Pennines to the east, the Bowland Fells to the northwest, and the West Pennine Moors to the south. It is included in a detached part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==History==
The name &quot;Pendle Hill&quot; combines the words for hill from three different languages (as does Bredon Hill in Worcestershire). In the 13th century it was called &quot;Pennul&quot; or &quot;Penhul&quot;, apparently from the Cumbric &quot;pen&quot; and Old English &quot;hyll&quot;, both meaning &quot;hill&quot;. The modern English &quot;hill&quot; was appended later, after the original meaning of Pendle had become opaque.

Neolithic and Bronze Age burial sites have been discovered at and around the summit of the hill.

There is an ancient local legend that the Devil once jumped from Hameldon Hill to an outcrop overlooking Sabden, on the southwest slope of Pendle, leaving footprints in the sandstone. Here he gathered rocks in an apron, and after proceeding the short distance to Apronfull, threw a boulder aimed at Clitheroe Castle. At that moment the apron string broke causing the boulder to land near Pendleton and creating the pile of rocks atop the slight prominence there.

The hill is famous for its links to three events which took place in the 17th century: the Pendle witch trials (1612), Richard Towneley&#x27;s barometer experiment (1661), and the vision of George Fox (1652), which led to the foundation of the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) movement.

===Quakers===
In his autobiography, George Fox said he had a vision on Pendle Hill in 1652, during the early years of the Quakers:

Pendle continues to be linked to the Quakers, who take pilgrimage there and use the name for the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===Witches and the supernatural===
The story of the Pendle witches is a notorious and well-documented example of cases brought against alleged witches in 17th-century England.

The area became popular with ghost hunters after Living channel&#x27;s show &quot;Most Haunted&quot; visited it for a live investigation on Halloween 2004. The show&#x27;s presenter, Yvette Fielding, said it was the scariest episode they had made.

Pendle Hill and the surrounding area are the setting for 1951&#x27;s classic &quot;Mist Over Pendle&quot; by Robert Neill, and also for the fourth book in Joseph Delaney&#x27;s &quot;Spook&#x27;s&quot; series, called &quot;The Spook&#x27;s Battle&quot;.

&quot;The Witchfinders&quot;, the eighth episode of the eleventh series of the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, takes place during the 17th-century Pendle witch trials.

To mark the 400th anniversary, in January 2012 local artist Philippe Handford created a huge installation by putting &#x27;1612&#x27; on the side of Pendle Hill using of horticultural fleece.

==Geography==
===Topography===
Pendle Hill is separated from the nearby main bulk of the Bowland Fells by the River Ribble. This isolation means that Pendle Hill is in fact the most prominent child summit of Kinder Scout, far away in the Peak District, rather than a child of Ward&#x27;s Stone, the highest point in Bowland. It is included in a detached part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Pendle Water, which runs through Ogden Clough, has its source on the summit plateau, heading southwest before turning back to the east as it falls into the Ogden valley. It joins the Lancashire Calder near Burnley, a few miles upstream from the confluence with Sabden Brook, which drains the southwest slopes of the hill. Mearley Brook cuts a large clough onto the northwest face, with its tributaries and those of Pendleton Brook draining this side directly into the River Ribble.

===Geology===
The sloping plateau summit of Pendle Hill is formed from the Pendle Grit, a coarse Carboniferous age sandstone assigned to the Millstone Grit Group. It overlies a thick sequence of Carboniferous Limestone beds. In chronostratigraphy, the British sub-stage of the Carboniferous period, the &#x27;Pendleian&#x27; derives its name from Pendle Hill where an exposure in Light Clough is taken as the type locality.

Much of the lower slopes are mantled by thick deposits of glacial till or boulder clay dating from the last ice age. The historic decomposition of sphagnum moss on the hill has led to it being covered in peat.

The steep slopes of its eastern and southern flanks have given rise to a series of landslips.

<doc id="949744" wikidata="Q4743159" url="?curid=949744" title="American Beetles">
<text>American Beetles is the single most comprehensive description of the beetles of North America north of the tropical area of Mexico. It was started by Ross H. Arnett, Jr. as an update of his classic &quot;The Beetles of the United States&quot;; along with Michael C. Thomas, he enlisted more than 60 specialists to write treatments of each family. The work outlived Arnett, and was published by CRC Press in 2001 (vol. 1) and 2002 (vol. 2).

This is a highly technical book, with extensive references to the literature.
The introduction includes a section on beetle anatomy that introduces all the technical terms used later. The bulk of the content consists of treatments of the 130-odd families known to occur in North America (a couple dozen are not known from North America, and are not described); the descriptive material applies worldwide, and there are brief notes about non-North American family members.

A family treatment consists of a morphological description, including the larvae if known, habits and habitats, status of the classification, a key to the Nearctic genera (and sometimes species, if the family is small), and short treatments of the subtaxa. Every family gets at least one drawing of a member, and larger families may include dozens of drawings illustrating particular characters important for classification. Note that the classification that appears in Volume 1, pp. 10–13, is superseded by a number of changes that appeared in Volume 2 (the relegation of the families Monommatidae, Colydiidae, and Bruchidae to subfamily status, and the revised spelling of Ripiphoridae), and these changes have been incorporated into the List of subgroups of the order Coleoptera.

A handful of color photographs are included in a center section.

<doc id="949745" wikidata="Q319240" url="?curid=949745" title="Alu Alkhanov">
<text>Alu Dadashevich Alkhanov (; born 20 January 1957) is a Russian politician and the former president of Russia&#x27;s Chechen Republic. He is a career police officer who fought within the ranks of the Russian Armed Forces during the First Chechen War. He was elected as president on 30 August 2004. On 15 February 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin dismissed Alkhanov as Chechen president and appointed him a Deputy Justice Minister of Russia.

==Biography==
Born in Taldykorgan Province, Kazakhstan, Alkhanov joined the Soviet Armed Forces on leaving school. He joined the Soviet Militsiya service in 1983, graduating from the transport police school in Mogilev (now in Belarus). He went on to the High Police School in Rostov-on-Don before becoming Deputy Head of the North Caucasus Transport Department of the former Chechen-Ingushetia government in Grozny in 1992. He was later promoted to head the department, a post which he held until 1997.

When the First Chechen War broke out in 1994, Alkhanov supported the Russian side against the separatists. He was decorated with the Order of Courage for his actions during the separatists&#x27; assault on Grozny in 1996. In April 2003, he was appointed Interior Minister of Chechnya in the government of Akhmad Kadyrov and was made a Major General of the Chechen police. When Kadyrov was assassinated on 9 May 2004, Akhnanov became the favoured candidate of the Russian government.

== Presidency ==
On 1 June 2006, Alkhanov said he would prefer his republic be governed by Sharia law and suggested adapting the Islamic code.

He was widely seen to be in conflict with Chechen prime minister Ramzan Kadyrov, a former rebel fighter with presidential ambitions. Kadyrov eventually replaced Alkhanov as president in February 2007, following by placing his own people in all the leading positions.

=== Election controversy ===

Alu Alkhanov&#x27;s election in August 2004 was controversial from the outset. The election of his predecessor had been marred by allegations of ballot stuffing, voter intimidation by Russian soldiers and the exclusion of possible separatist candidates. As a career bureaucrat, Alkhanov had no obvious popular base and was seen by many observers as the placeman of the government of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Critics of Russian policy in Chechnya claimed that the government would not permit Alkhanov to be defeated, and that the outcome of the vote had been predetermined well in advance.

Alkhanov faced seven challengers. The most serious of these, Malik Saidullayev, a Moscow-based Chechen businessman, was barred from standing on the technicality of failing to fill his application correctly. The other six challengers had little recognition within Chechnya and several had ties with the government. They were:

* Abdula Bugayev, an historian and director of the Chechen branch of the Modern Humanities Academy. He finished a distant second to Kadyrov in 2003 with 5.7% of the votes.
* Movsar Khamidov, a colonel in the Chechen department of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB.
* Vakha Visayev, an economist and an adviser to the acting Chechen president, Sergey Abramov.
* Mukhmud-Khasan Asakov, a staff member of the Chechen State Council.
* Magomed Aidamirov, a businessman from the village of Tolstoy-Yurt.
* Umar Abuyev, director-general of the Chechen Petrochemical Company.

Alkhanov&#x27;s platform was effectively a continuation of his predecessor&#x27;s policies, with Chechnya continuing to remain part of Russia; economic autonomy; attracting aid and investment; cutting unemployment and the Russian military presence; and opening peace talks with separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov.

In the event, Alkhanov won by a landslide majority with 73.67% of the votes on an 85.25% turnout. Khamidov was second, with 8.95 percent, and Abdula Bugayev came third, with 4.5%. Visayev was fourth, Abuyev fifth, Asakov sixth and Aidamarov seventh, gaining between 0.6% to 4.3% of the vote. 1% of voters voted &quot;against all candidates&quot;.

The results of the election were regarded with scepticism by some outside observers and the Chechen opposition. The U.S. Department of State, and International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights questioned the fairness of the elections and highlighted the disqualification of Saidullayev. The elections was internationally monitored by the monitors from CIS and LAS; western monitors didn&#x27;t participate in the monitoring of the elections despite being invited. Polling conditions have been questioned; Khamidov has said that his campaign staff had recorded numerous irregularities and will contest the vote results in court.

== Later career ==
On the day of his resignation from the presidency, Alkhanov was appointed Deputy Minister of Justice of the Russian Federation. He holds the special rank of Colonel General of Justice.

Alu Alkhanov is married, with three children.

==Honours and awards==

* Order of Merit for the Fatherland, 4th class (February 15, 2007) – for outstanding contribution to the socio-economic development of the strengthening of Russian statehood and constitutional order
* Order of Courage
* Order of Honour (October 12, 2011) – for labour achievements and many years of diligent work

<text>Keith Max Jackson (October 18, 1928 – January 12, 2018) was an American sports commentator, journalist, author, and radio personality, known for his career with ABC Sports (1966–2006). While he covered a variety of sports over his career, he is best known for his coverage of college football from 1952 until 2006, and his distinctive voice, &quot;a throwback voice, deep and operatic. A voice that was to college football what Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s was to war. It was the voice of ultimate authority in his profession.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early life===
A farmer&#x27;s son, Jackson was born in Roopville, Georgia and grew up on a farm outside Carrollton, near the Alabama state line. He was the only surviving child in a poor family and grew up listening to sports on the radio. After enlisting and serving as a mechanic in the United States Marine Corps, he attended Washington State University in Pullman under the G.I. Bill. Jackson began as a political science major, but he became interested in broadcasting. He graduated in 1954 with a degree in speech communications.

===Broadcast career===
Though best known for his college football broadcasts, Jackson announced numerous other sports for ABC throughout his career, including Major League Baseball, NBA basketball, boxing, auto racing, PGA Tour golf, the USFL, and the Olympic Games. He briefly worked college basketball with Dick Vitale. Jackson also served as the pregame, halftime, and postgame anchor for ABC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XXII in 1988. During his on-air tenure, he is credited with nicknaming the Rose Bowl as &quot;The Grandaddy of Them All&quot; and Michigan Stadium as &quot;The Big House&quot;.

====Early assignments====
Jackson began his career as a broadcaster in 1952, when he called a game between Stanford and Washington State on the Tidewater Associated Oil Co. radio network. He then worked for KOMO radio in Seattle, and later for KOMO-TV from 1954 to 1964 as co-anchor for their first news team (first co-anchor news team on the West Coast) covering Seafair hydroplane races, minor league Seattle Rainiers baseball games, and University of Washington football games. In 1958, Jackson became the first American sports announcer to broadcast an event from the Soviet Union, a crew race between the Washington Huskies and a Soviet team. Despite heavy suspicion and numerous hurdles by the Soviet authorities, Jackson and his cohorts were able to cover the race: the first ever American sports victory on Russian soil.

Jackson became a radio news correspondent for ABC News Radio and sports director of ABC Radio West in 1964 before joining ABC Sports in 1966. He helped Walter Cronkite cover the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco.

====Professional football====
In the early 1960s, Jackson covered American Football League games. In 1970, he was chosen to be the first play-by-play announcer on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; covering the NFL, but he remained in that capacity only for the program&#x27;s first season. Frank Gifford was ABC&#x27;s initial target, but could not get out of his CBS contract until after the 1970 season. In 1971, however, Gifford landed the job. Jackson found out that he had been taken off the &quot;Monday Night&quot; package from 38 messages, not from Roone Arledge himself. This incident led to some contention between Jackson and the brass at ABC. With Gifford&#x27;s death in August 2015, Jackson became the last surviving member of the broadcast teams that called &quot;MNF&quot; games from the early 1970s.

Jackson was the lead play-by-play announcer for the United States Football League broadcasts on ABC from 1983 to 1985. He was paired with Lynn Swann and Tim Brant. He called all three championship games in the league&#x27;s short history.

As previously mentioned, for ABC&#x27;s broadcast of Super Bowl XXII at the end of the 1987 season, Jackson served as the host for the pregame, halftime, and postgame coverage.

====Olympic Games====
Jackson was involved in the ABC coverage of the 1972 Summer Olympics and continued to contribute even when an attack by Palestinian terrorists transformed the coverage from that of a typical sporting event to a greater international and historical news event. In all, he covered a total of 10 Summer and Winter Olympic Games. Jackson covered swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics and track and field at the 1976 Summer Olympics. He covered speed-skating during the 1980 Winter Olympics featuring Eric Heiden. He was offered the position of play-by-play for hockey, but turned it down (the position ultimately went to Al Michaels). Jackson called speed skating and ski jumping at the 1984 Winter Olympics. He covered basketball in 1984. He was the weekend afternoon host for ABC&#x27;s final Olympics in 1988 from Calgary.

====NBA====
He was ABC&#x27;s lead basketball play-by-play announcer (succeeding Chris Schenkel in the role) with legendary NBA player Bill Russell for two years (1971-1973) until ABC lost the NBA broadcasting rights to CBS following the conclusion of the 1973 Finals.

====&quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;====
Jackson was a regular part of ABC&#x27;s popular &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; (&quot;WWOS&quot;), covering both popular sports and obscure events like wrist wrestling. For &quot;WWOS&quot; he covered Evel Knievel&#x27;s successful jump at Exhibition Stadium, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on August 20, 1974; He also handled &quot;WWOS&quot;&#x27; first coverage of boxer Sugar Ray Leonard at the North American Continental Boxing Championships on July 26, 1975, who Jackson called a young boxer to watch. He teamed with Jackie Stewart and Chris Economaki in (&quot;WWOS&quot;) coverage of auto racing; among the notable events covered by Jackson was the 1974 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway and the 1975 Indianapolis 500. In the mid-1970s, Jackson also broadcast the United States Grand Prix motocross races from Carlsbad, California.

====Major League Baseball====
In baseball, he alongside former Mets, Phillies, Yankees, and Cardinals broadcaster Tim McCarver called the famous 16-inning sixth game of the 1986 National League Championship Series between the New York Mets and Houston Astros. That turned out to be the final Major League Baseball game that Jackson would broadcast. Jackson had previously broadcast ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1977, 1979 and 1981 World Series (Jackson split play-by-play duties with Al Michaels for the latter two with Jackson calling the games at the American League site), the 1978, 1980, and 1982 All-Star Game (again, sharing play-by-play duties with Al Michaels for the latter two), the 1980 National League Championship Series, the 1976, 1978 and 1982 American League Championship Series, the 1981 American League Division Series between the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers, and the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox alongside Don Drysdale. He also called various &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; and other regular-season games for ABC throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Jackson&#x27;s lead role on ABC&#x27;s college football coverage occasionally interfered with his postseason baseball commitments. For instance, he was unavailable to call Game 1 of the 1976 ALCS because he had just finished calling an Oklahoma vs. Texas college football game for ABC. Thus, Bob Uecker filled in for Jackson for Game 1. In 1978, Jackson called another Oklahoma-Texas football game for ABC on the afternoon of October 7, then flew to New York, arriving just in time to call Game 4 of the 1978 American League Championship Series that same night. On October 11, 1980, Jackson once again called an Oklahoma-Texas football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the 1980 National League Championship Series. In the meantime, Drysdale filled in for him on play-by-play for the early innings. On October 10, 1981, he called another Oklahoma v. Texas college football game for ABC and missed Game 4 of the Milwaukee-New York series. Again, Don Drysdale filled-in for him on play-by-play in his absence alongside color commentator Howard Cosell.

====College basketball====
Starting in 1987, he was ABC&#x27;s lead play-by-play announcer for college basketball, teaming with analyst Dick Vitale. This partnership lasted until 1992.

====College football====
For all his success, he received the most acclaim for his coverage of college football. He genuinely enjoyed the sport and the purity of it. Jackson began announcing college football when television play-by-play announcers did not always have regular analysts. He would only once miss working a college season in his over 50 years (when he served as play-by-play announcer during the inaugural season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;), beginning in 1952. Jackson was joined in the booth by Joe Paterno for the 1974 Michigan-Ohio State game in Columbus, while Woody Hayes accompanied him for the 1974 Notre Dame-USC game.
In his many years covering college football, Jackson was paired with a wide variety of color commentators, including Jackie Jensen (1966–1968), Lee Grosscup (1972–1973), Bud Wilkinson (1969–1975), Ara Parseghian (1975–1980), Frank Broyles (1978–1985), Lynn Swann (1984–1985), Tim Brant (1986, 2000–2002), Bob Griese (1987–1999), and Dan Fouts (2002–2005). Jackson called 16 Sugar Bowls and 15 Rose Bowls during his time at ABC.

For many years, he was assigned by ABC to the primary national game of the week. His quirky expressions such as &quot;Whoa, Nellie!&quot;, &quot;Fum-BLE!&quot; and &quot;Hold the phonnnnne!&quot; (following a penalty flag) are often the subject of comedic imitation. Though he greatly popularized it, Jackson notes that he learned the term &quot;Whoa, Nellie&quot; from earlier television announcer Dick Lane. He has often referred to offensive and defensive line players as the &quot;Big Uglies&quot;, or to an individual by saying &quot;That guy...is a hoss&quot; (horse). Jackson is also credited with coining the nickname for Michigan Stadium, &quot;The Big House.&quot; In the season before his first retirement, during what was thought to be his final game at The Big House, the Michigan Marching Band&#x27;s halftime show concluded by spelling out &quot;Thanks Keith&quot; across the field. The 111,019 fans turned toward the press box, stood up and cheered for the commentator. As a part of the halftime event former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler presented Jackson with a jersey with &quot;The Big House&quot; across the front and a Michigan football helmet.

During the mid-&#x27;80s, he began falling out of favor with ABC executives due to the rise of stars such as Al Michaels and Jim Lampley. Jackson&#x27;s contract expired after the 1986 Sugar Bowl. He had a 3-month &quot;retirement&quot; until new ABC Sports President Dennis Swanson personally offered him a 3-year contract, which he accepted.

In the 1990s, Jackson recorded videos for the centennial of the Alabama Crimson Tide. In 2006, Jackson introduced the Nebraska Cornhuskers&#x27; &quot;Tunnel Walk&quot; video on the stadium &quot;HuskerVision&quot; screens. This video played before every home game at Memorial Stadium in the 2006 season. It was also used for one home game in 2007, against Texas A&amp;M. On September 26, 2009, for the 300th consecutive sellout of Memorial Stadium, Jackson again provided a video tribute to the fans of Nebraska.

Jackson&#x27;s connections to the University of Nebraska remain strong. It was Jackson himself that the university contacted when designing its new press box facility—Jackson&#x27;s advice included a recommendation that it include a separate restroom inside the broadcast booth, as few if any broadcast booths had any suitable restroom facilities. When Jackson broadcast the Nebraska-California game the following season (the debut of the Cornhuskers&#x27; new pressbox), he found a restroom in the booth with a sign reading &quot;The Keith Jackson Memorial Bippy.&quot; The sign was a joke from Jackson&#x27;s longtime friend, Nebraska sports information director Don Bryant. The name stuck, and a permanent plaque was put up next to the restroom door that reads &quot;The Keith Jackson Toilet Facility – Dedicated Sept 11, 1999&quot;.

Jackson would call the 1972 USC Trojans football team the greatest team he ever saw. Jackson, who was in his first year in ABC football broadcasting narrating the taped highlights of the 1967 USC vs. UCLA football game, declared it many years later to be the greatest game he has ever seen.

Jackson&#x27;s career was not free of incidents. During the 1978 Gator Bowl, Jackson missed Ohio State Head Coach Woody Hayes&#x27; infamous punch of Clemson defensive lineman Charlie Bauman. Bauman had intercepted a pass and was pushed out of bounds on the Ohio State sidelines, and a frustrated Hayes threw a forearm at Bauman&#x27;s throat. Jackson (and color commentator Ara Parseghian) failed to see or comment on Hayes&#x27; actions, which had been captured from a different vantage point on camera. No replay of the actual incident was available in the booth during the telecast, as the television crew was working with limited replay capability. In addition to this, no sideline reporter was available to provide information on the cause of the unsportsmanlike penalties that occurred as a result. This led to accusations that Jackson was protecting Hayes, who was later fired for the incident.

====Retirement====
Approaching his 70th birthday, Jackson announced his first retirement from college football at the end of the 1998 season and his intention to live full-time at his home in California. Choosing the first BCS National Championship Game as his last broadcast, Jackson called the 1999 National Championship at the Fiesta Bowl between Tennessee and Florida State. He concluded the program by stating &quot;Tennessee 23, Florida State 16. And so it is done. I say goodbye to all of you. God bless and good night.&quot;

Jackson rescinded his decision the following fall and began to do a more limited schedule of games, teamed with Dan Fouts, Tim Brant, and later Fouts again, almost exclusively sticking to venues on the West Coast, closer to his home in California. Two notable exceptions were the 2003 Michigan–Ohio State and the 2005 Oklahoma vs. Texas football game. Each was the 100th meeting between the two archrivals. He strongly hinted that he was interested in retiring for good after the 2005 season, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was feeling his age after 53 seasons and had become upset at the increased number of mistakes in his play calling in the last few years. ABC tried convincing Jackson to stay, but his decision was firm. He officially announced his retirement on April 27, 2006, noting he did not want to &quot;die in a stadium parking lot.&quot; His last game call was the 2006 Rose Bowl featuring Texas vs. Southern California in the BCS National Championship Game. The game was the last college football game shown on ABC under the &quot;ABC Sports&quot; brand, as ABC Sports was integrated with ESPN the following summer and is now known as ESPN on ABC.

====&quot;Big Ten Icons&quot;====
In March 2010, the Big Ten Conference announced that Jackson would host a 20-episode series called &quot;Big Ten Icons&quot; for the Big Ten Network which would highlight what the Big Ten Conference considers the league&#x27;s top 50 student-athletes. The series was presented countdown style, and the top Big Ten student athlete was revealed during a program broadcast during the 2011 Big Ten Basketball tournament.

===Awards and honors===
In 1999, the National Football Foundation awarded Jackson the Gold Medal Award, its highest honor. The same year he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame for his many years of contribution to &quot;The Granddaddy of Them All&quot;. The Edward R. Murrow School of Communication at Washington State University awarded their alumnus with the Murrow Award for top leaders in the communication industry in 1999; Jackson was a charter member of the WSU Foundation, founded in 1979, provided scholarship money to the Murrow School and chaired the fund-raising drive for the school&#x27;s alumni center. In 1994, Jackson was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame. On April 24, 1995, he was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame, having won its National Sportscaster of the Year five successive times. The American Football Coaches Association awarded him its Amos Alonzo Stagg Award in 1993 as an individual &quot;whose services have been outstanding in the advancement of the best interests of football.&quot; He was the first sports announcer to receive the Stagg award.

Longtime Penn State Head Coach Joe Paterno said of Jackson: &quot;I don&#x27;t think you could say that there is any one person who is not a coach, athletic director or administrator who has done more for college football than Keith Jackson&quot;. Michigan Head Coach Lloyd Carr described Jackson as &quot;a symbol of all the good things in college football&quot;.

The Rose Bowl stadium&#x27;s radio and TV booths were renamed &quot;The Keith Jackson Broadcast Center&quot; in December 2015.

In 2010, Jackson was awarded the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College.

In 2019, he was posthumously inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame.

===Film and television appearances===
Jackson had a minor career as an actor, often either playing himself, as on an episode of &quot;Coach&quot;; or a sportscaster like himself, as in &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966), appearing in the first speaking role of the film &quot;Football Announcer&quot; as a CBS play-by-play man, a network for whom he never worked. He has also appeared in and narrated several sports documentaries. His play-by-play of the 1977 World Series is used in the background of the Spike Lee film, &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999). In 2007, he appeared in clips and voice on the ESPN original series, &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, featuring clips from ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;, and ABC Sports&#x27; coverage of the 1977 World Series.

Jackson has appeared in numerous commercials, especially in the latter stages of his career. He once parodied his broadcast persona for a Miller Lite beer commercial, in which he played the officiating minister at a wedding, finishing with his famous line, &quot;Whoa, Nellie!&quot; He also appeared in commercials for Shoney&#x27;s, a chain of family-style restaurants well known in the Southeast, especially in his native Georgia. Jackson appeared in &quot;The Legend of Gatorade&quot; ads, which he humorously alluded to during his live coverage of the 2006 Rose Bowl. In 2006, he also was shown in a commercial for Ice Breakers&#x27; Ice Cubes with Hilary Duff, Haylie Duff and Joey Lawrence, again contributing his famous &quot;Whoa, Nellie!&quot;

Jackson was portrayed by actor Shuler Hensley in the 2002 made-for-cable film &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;, which aired on TNT. This film told the story of the initial seasons of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

===Personal life and death===
Jackson and his wife, Turi Ann, resided in California and also spent time in British Columbia, where they owned a vacation property. They had three children, Melanie Ann, Lindsey and Christopher. At the time of his death, he resided in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. On the subject of writing a book, Jackson admitted that he&#x27;d considered it, but joked that he would only sit down and work on one if he were to ever lose his golf swing.

Jackson died on January 12, 2018, at the age of 89.

<text>Alagir (; ) is an industrial town and the administrative center of Alagirsky District in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, Russia, located on the west bank of the Ardon River, west of the republic&#x27;s capital Vladikavkaz. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 20,949.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from Ossetian Uællag &#x27;Upper&#x27; and Ir &#x27;Ossetia&#x27;.

==History==
The town was established in 1850 by Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, the Viceroy of the Caucasus, near an ancient silver/lead mine in the nearby Alagir Gorge. It was built up as a fortification around a smelting plant and became a major mining center. By the end of the 19th century, it had been increasingly populated by Georgians and Russians who came to work there. During the Russian Civil War, in January 1919, Alagir was a scene of intense fighting, which resulted in heavy casualties in Georgian population and difficult flight of the survivors through the mountainous passes into Georgia. The Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin commented on the incident, blaming &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot; for atrocities in Alagir, which Georgians tend to attribute to the Ossetian radicals.

Alagir was granted town status in 1938. During World War II, on November 5, 1942, the German III Panzer Corps and Romanian 2nd Mountain Division (under von Kleist) captured the town and held it until it was recovered by the Soviet forces in early January 1943.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Alagir serves as the administrative center of Alagirsky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Alagirsky District as Alagir Town Under District Jurisdiction. As a municipal division, the town of Alagir (without the rural localities) is incorporated within Alagirsky Municipal District as Alagirskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
The town&#x27;s economy is still dominated by mining and mineral extraction, but it also has significant woodworking, canning, and manufacturing industries.

==Demographics==
Major ethnic groups comprising the town&#x27;s population, as of 2002, are:
*Ossetians: 91.1%
*Russians: 6.2%

==Notable people==
*Stanislav Cherchesov, association football manager and former player
*Aslan Dudiyev, professional association football player
*Khetag Gazyumov, freestyle wrestler
*Igor Kupiejew, professional freestyle wrestler
*Sergey Menyaylo, politician; Head of North Ossetia-Alania, former Governor of Sevastopol
*Wakanohō Toshinori, sumo wrestler

<doc id="949755" wikidata="Q945507" url="?curid=949755" title="Canadian Indian residential school system">
<text>The Canadian Indian residential school system was a network of boarding schools for Indigenous peoples. The network was funded by the Canadian government&#x27;s Department of Indian Affairs and administered by various Christian churches. The school system was created to isolate Indigenous children from the influence of their own culture and religion in order to assimilate them into the dominant Euro-Canadian culture.

The system began with laws before Confederation and was mainly active after the Indian Act was passed in 1876. Attendance at these schools became compulsory in 1894, and many schools were located far from Indigenous communities to limit family contact. By the 1930s, about 30 percent of Indigenous children were attending residential schools. The last federally-funded residential school closed in 1997, with schools operating across most provinces and territories. Over the course of the system&#x27;s more than hundred-year existence, around 150,000 children were placed in residential schools nationally.

The schools caused significant harm to Indigenous children by removing them from their families and culture, leading to physical and sexual abuse, malnutrition, and disease. Many students faced forced assimilation, losing their identities and struggling to fit into both their communities and mainstream society. This disruption has contributed to ongoing issues like post-traumatic stress and substance abuse in Indigenous communities. The number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to incomplete records. Estimates range from 3,200 to over 30,000, mostly from disease.

Starting in 2008, there were apologies from politicians and religious groups for their roles in the system. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada was established to uncover truths about the schools, concluding in a 2015 report that labeled the system as cultural genocide. Efforts have been ongoing to identify unmarked graves at former school sites, and the Pope acknowledged the system as genocide in 2022. The House of Commons called for recognition of the residential school system as genocide in October 2022.

==History==

Attempts to assimilate Indigenous peoples were rooted in imperial colonialism centred around European worldviews and cultural practices, and a concept of land ownership based on the discovery doctrine. As explained in the executive summary of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada&#x27;s (TRC) final report: &quot;Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves ... a belief of racial and cultural superiority.&quot;

Assimilation efforts began as early as the 17th century with the arrival of French missionaries in New France. They were resisted by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the Recollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also played a role in the decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.

Educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior to the introduction of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in what is now the province of Ontario, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.
Although many of these early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The Mohawk Institute Residential School, the oldest continuously operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.

The renewed interest in residential schools in the early 1800s can be linked to the decline in military hostility faced by the settlers, particularly after the War of 1812. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This change was also associated with the transfer of responsibility for interactions with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.

Beginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government&#x27;s Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into European Canadian society. The TRC found that the schools, and the removal of children from their families, amounted to cultural genocide, a conclusion that echoed the words of historian John S. Milloy, who argued that the system&#x27;s aim was to &quot;kill the Indian in the child.&quot; Over the course of the system&#x27;s more than hundred-year existence, around 150,000 children were placed in residential schools nationally. As the system was designed as an immersion program, Indigenous children were in many schools prohibited from, and sometimes punished for, speaking their own languages or practising their own faiths. The primary goal was to convert Indigenous children to Christianity and acculturate them.
Many of the government-funded residential schools were run by churches of various denominations. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by 16 Catholic dioceses and about three dozen Catholic communities; 21 were operated by the Church of England / Anglican Church of Canada; 13 were operated by the United Church of Canada, and 2 were operated by Presbyterians. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed by the federal government for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.

===Government involvement===
Although the &quot;British North America Act&quot;, 1867 made education in Canada the jurisdiction of the provincial governments, the Indigenous peoples and their treaties fell under the jurisdiction of the federal government. As a condition of several treaties, the federal government agreed to provide for Indigenous education. Residential schools were funded under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; by what was then the federal Department of the Interior. Adopted in 1876 as &quot;An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting Indians&quot;, it consolidated all previous laws placing Indigenous communities, land and finances under federal control. As explained by the TRC, the act &quot;made Indians wards of the state, unable to vote in provincial or federal elections or enter the professions if they did not surrender their status, and severely limited their freedom to participate in spiritual and cultural practices.&quot;

The report commissioned by Governor General Charles Bagot, titled &quot;Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada&quot; and referred to as the Bagot Report, is seen as the foundational document for the federal residential school system. It was supported by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the West Indies, and Egerton Ryerson, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in Upper Canada. This letter was published in 1898 as an appendix to a larger report entitled &quot;Statistics Respecting Indian Schools&quot;.
The &quot;Gradual Civilization Act&quot; of 1857 and the &quot;Gradual Enfranchisement Act&quot; of 1869 formed the foundations for this system prior to Confederation. These acts assumed the inherent superiority of French and British ways, and the need for Indigenous peoples to become French or English speakers, Christians, and farmers. At the time, many Indigenous leaders argued to have these acts overturned. The &quot;Gradual Civilization Act&quot; awarded of land to any Indigenous male deemed &quot;sufficiently advanced in the elementary branches of education&quot; and would automatically enfranchise him, removing any tribal affiliation or treaty rights. With this legislation, and through the creation of residential schools, the government believed Indigenous peoples could eventually become assimilated into the general population. Individual allotments of farmland would require changes in the communal reserve system, something fiercely opposed by First Nations governments.

In January 1879, John A. Macdonald, Prime Minister of what was then post-Confederation Canada, commissioned politician Nicholas Flood Davin to write a report regarding the industrial boarding-school system in the United States. Now known as the Davin Report, the &quot;Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds&quot; was submitted to Ottawa on March 14, 1879, and made the case for a cooperative approach between the Canadian government and the church to implement the assimilation pursued by President of the United States Ulysses S. Grant. Davin&#x27;s report relied heavily on findings he acquired through consultations with government officials and representatives of the Five Civilized Tribes in Washington, DC, and church officials in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He visited only one industrial day school, in Minnesota, before submitting his findings. In his report Davin concluded that the best way to assimilate Indigenous peoples was to start with children in a residential setting, away from their families.

Davin&#x27;s findings were supported by Vital-Justin Grandin, who felt that while the likelihood of civilizing adults was low, there was hope when it came to Indigenous children. He explained in a letter to Public Works Minister Hector-Louis Langevin that the best course of action would be to make children &quot;lead a life different from their parents and cause them to forget the customs, habits &amp; language of their ancestors.&quot; In 1883 Parliament approved $43,000 for three industrial schools and the first, Battleford Industrial School, opened on December 1 of that year. By 1900, there were 61 schools in operation.

The government began purchasing church-run boarding schools in the 1920s. During this period capital costs associated with the schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated due to the lack of written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.

By the 1930s, government officials recognized that the residential school system was financially unsustainable and failing to meet the intended goal of training and assimilating Indigenous children into European-Canadian society. Robert Hoey, Superintendent of Welfare and Training in the Indian Affairs Branch of the federal Department of Mines and Resources, opposed the expansion of new schools, noting in 1936 that &quot;to build educational institutions, particularly residential schools, while the money at our disposal is insufficient to keep the schools already erected in a proper state of repair, is, to me, very unsound and a practice difficult to justify.&quot; He proposed the expansion of day schools, an approach to educating Indigenous children that he would continue to pursue after being promoted to director of the welfare and training branch in 1945. The proposal was resisted by the United Church, the Anglican Church, and the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who believed that the solution to the system&#x27;s failure was not restructuring but intensification.

Between 1945 and 1955, the number of First Nations students in day schools run by Indian Affairs expanded from 9,532 to 17,947. This growth in student population was accompanied by an amendment to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes marked the government&#x27;s shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools.

Despite the shift in policy from educational assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued through much of the 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of section 88 of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report &quot;Native Children and the Child Welfare System&quot;. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.

In 1969, after years of sharing power with churches, the DIA took sole control of the residential school system. The last federally-funded residential school, Kivalliq Hall in Rankin Inlet, closed in 1997. Residential schools operated in every Canadian province and territory with the exception of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. It is estimated that the number of residential schools reached its peak in the early 1930s with 80 schools and more than 17,000 enrolled students. About 150,000 children are believed to have attended a residential school over the course of the system&#x27;s existence.

===Parental resistance and compulsory attendance===

Some parents and families of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including the increase of centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements to the quality of education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.

In 1894, amendments to the &quot;Indian Act&quot; made attendance at a day school, if there was a day school on the reserve on which the child resided, compulsory for status Indian children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, the health of the children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance at a day school on the reserve was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrolment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.

The introduction of the &quot;Family Allowance Act&quot; in 1945 stipulated that school-aged children had to be enrolled in school for families to qualify for the &quot;baby bonus&quot;, further coercing Indigenous parents into having their children attend.

==Conditions==

Students in the residential school system were faced with a multitude of abuses by teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline that would not have been tolerated in any other Canadian school system. Corporal punishment was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls or punish and deter runaways – whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and tuberculosis; in one school, the death rate reached 69 percent. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves – overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.

Until the late 1950s, when the federal government shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisanal skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and kept some students undernourished as the control sample.

Details of the mistreatment of students were published numerous times throughout the 20th century by government officials reporting on school conditions, and in the proceedings of civil cases brought forward by survivors seeking compensation for the abuse they endured. The conditions and impact of residential schools were also brought to light in popular culture as early as 1967, with the publication of &quot;The Lonely Death of Chanie Wenjack&quot; by Ian Adams in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; and the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67. In the 1990s, investigations and memoirs by former students revealed that many students at residential schools were subjected to severe physical, psychological, and sexual abuse by school staff members and by older students. Among the former students to come forward was Phil Fontaine, then Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, who in October 1990 publicly discussed the abuse he and others suffered while attending Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.

After the government closed most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater awareness by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities to draw attention to the residential school system&#x27;s legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.

===Funding===
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission list three reasons behind the federal government&#x27;s decision to establish residential schools.

# Provide Aboriginal people with skills to participate in a market-based economy.
# Further political assimilation, in hope that educated students would give up their status and not return to their reserves or families. 
# Schools were &quot;engines of cultural and spiritual change&quot; where &quot;&#x27;savages&#x27; were to emerge as Christian &#x27;white men&#x27;&quot;.

In addition to these three the Commission stated a national security element and quoted Andsell Macrae, a commissioner with Indian Affairs: &quot;it is unlikely that any Tribe or Tribes would give trouble of a serious nature to the Government whose members had children completely under Government control.&quot;
The federal government sought to cut costs by adopting the residential industrial school system of the United States. Indian Commissioner Edgar Dewdney aspired to have the residential schools, through forced labour, be financially independent a few years after opening. The government believed through the industrial system and cheap labour costs of missionary staff it could &quot;operate a residential school system on a nearly cost-free basis.&quot; Students &quot;were expected to raise or grow and prepare most of the food they ate, to make and repair much of their clothing, and to maintain the schools.&quot; Most schools did this through a system where students studied for half the day and did &quot;vocational training&quot; for the other half. This system failed and the schools never became self-supporting.

By 1891, the government cut already low salaries, stopped covering operating costs, and implemented a fixed amount of funding per student. This policy drove competition and encouraged the admission of students that were deemed &quot;too young or too sick.&quot; The chronic underfunding developed a health crisis within the schools and a financial crisis within the missionary groups. In 1911, in an attempt to alleviate the health crisis, the federal government increased per capita grant funding. However, the funding did not adjust for inflation. In the 1930s, throughout the Great Depression and World War II, it was repeatedly reduced, and by 1937, the per capita grant averaged just $180 per student per year. For perspective, per-capita costs for comparable institutions included: Manitoba School for the Deaf: $642, Manitoba School for Boys: $550, U.S. Chilocco Indian Agricultural School: $350. The Child Welfare League of America stated per capita costs for &quot;well-run institutions&quot; ranged between $313 and $541; Canada was paying 57.5% of the minimum figure. Changes in per capita costs did not occur until the 1950s and were seen as insignificant. In 1966, Saskatchewan residential schools per capita costs ranged from $694 and $1,193, which is 7–36% of what other Canadian child-welfare institutions were paying ($3,300 and $9,855) and 5–25% of what U.S. residential care was paying ($4,500 and $14,059.)

Government officials believed that since many staff members belonged to religious orders with vows of poverty or missionary organizations, pay was relatively unimportant. Thus, almost all staff were poorly paid, and schools had trouble recruiting and retaining staff. In 1948, C.H. Birdsall, chair of the United Church committee responsible for the Edmonton school, in regard to the lack of funding for salaries, accommodations, and equipment, stated that it was &quot;doubtful the present work with Indian Children could properly be called education.&quot; In 1948, Sechelt school staff were paying full-time staff a salary of $1800. In the 1960s, Christie school staff were paid $50 a month.

The per capita grant system severely decreased the education quality. British Columbia Indian Superintendent Arthur Wellesley Vowell in response to one of his agents recommending they only approve qualified teaching staff stated that that would require more funding and that Indian Affairs did not &quot;entertain requests for increased grants to Indian boarding and industrial schools.&quot; The pay was so low relative to provincial schools that many of the teachers lacked any teaching qualifications.

Federal cuts to funding during the Great Depression resulted in students paying the price. By 1937, at the Kamloops Indian Residential School, milk production among the schools dairy herds was reduced by 50%. The federal government refused to fund construction for an additional barn to increase milk production and isolate the sick animals. Even among other schools dairy herds, funding was so low that milk was separated with &quot;skimmed milk served to the children&quot; and the fat turned to dairy products sold to fund the schools. In 1939, the Presbyterian school in Kenora began charging students 10 cents a loaf until their Indian agent ordered the school to stop.

===Family visitation===
Parents and family members regularly travelled to the schools, often camping outside to be closer to their children. So many parents made the trip that Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed argued that the schools should be moved farther from the reserves to make visiting more difficult. He also objected to allowing children to return home during school breaks and holidays because he believed the trips interrupted their assimilation.

Visitation, for those who could make the journey, was strictly controlled by school officials in a manner similar to the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases schools denied parents access to their children altogether. Others required families to meet with them in the presence of school officials and speak only in English; parents who could not speak in English were unable to talk to their children. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed, without legislative authority to do so, the pass system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.

===Instruction style and outcomes===

Instruction provided to students was rooted in an institutional and European approach to education. It differed dramatically from child rearing in traditional knowledge systems based on &#x27;look, listen, and learn&#x27; models. Corporal punishment and loss of privileges characterized the residential school system, while traditional Indigenous approaches to education favour positive guidance toward desired behaviour through game-based play, story-telling, and formal ritualized ceremonies. While at school, many children had no contact with their families for up to 10 months at a time, and in some cases had no contact for years. The impact of the disconnect from their families was furthered by students being discouraged or prohibited from speaking Indigenous languages, even among themselves and outside the classroom, so that English or French would be learned and their own languages forgotten. In some schools, they were subject to physical violence for speaking their own languages or for practicing non-Christian faiths.

Most schools operated with the stated goal of providing students with the vocational training and social skills required to obtain employment and integrate into Canadian society after graduation. In actuality, these goals were poorly and inconsistently achieved. Many graduates were unable to land a job due to poor educational training. Returning home was equally challenging due to an unfamiliarity with their culture and, in some cases, an inability to communicate with family members using their traditional language. Instead of intellectual achievement and advancement, it was often physical appearance and dress, like that of middle class, urban teenagers, or the promotion of a Christian ethic, that was used as a sign of successful assimilation. There was no indication that school attendees achieved greater financial success than those who did not go to school. As the father of a pupil who attended Battleford Industrial School, in Saskatchewan, for five years explained: &quot;he cannot read, speak or write English, nearly all his time having been devoted to herding and caring for cattle instead of learning a trade or being otherwise educated. Such employment he can get at home.&quot;

===Experimentation===
Both academic research and the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee relay evidence that students were included in several scientific research experiments without their knowledge, their consent or the consent of their parents. These experiments include nutrition experiments which involved intentional malnourishment of children, vaccine trials for the BCG vaccine, as well as studies on extrasensory perception, vitamin D diet supplements, amebicides, isoniazid, hemoglobin, bedwetting, and dermatoglyphics.

==Mortality rates==

Residential school deaths were common and have been linked to poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 3,201 students had died, mostly from disease. TRC chair Justice Murray Sinclair has suggested that the number of deaths may exceed 6,000. The vast majority of deaths occurred before the 1950s.
The 1906 Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs, submitted by chief medical officer Peter Bryce, highlighted that the &quot;Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times&quot;. Among the list of causes he noted the infectious disease of tuberculosis and the role residential schools played in spreading the disease by way of poor ventilation and medical screening.
In 1907, Bryce reported on the conditions of Manitoba and North-West residential schools: &quot;we have created a situation so dangerous to health that I was often surprised that the results were not even worse than they have been shown statistically to be.&quot; In 1909, Bryce reported that, between 1894 and 1908, mortality rates at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30 to 60 per cent over five years (that is, five years after entry, 30 to 60 per cent of students had died, or 6 to 12 per cent per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published &quot;The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921.&quot; In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates could have been avoided if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.
In 1920 and 1922, Regina physician F.A. Corbett was commissioned to visit the schools in the west of the country, and found similar results to those reported by Bryce. At the Ermineskin school in Hobbema, Alberta, he found that 50 percent of the children had tuberculosis. At Sarcee Boarding School near Calgary, he noted that all 33 students were &quot;much below even a passable standard of health&quot; and but four were infected with tuberculosis&quot;. In one classroom, he found 16 ill children, many near death, who were being forced to sit through lessons.

In 2011, reflecting on the TRC&#x27;s research, Justice Sinclair told &quot;The Toronto Star&quot;: &quot;Missing children – that is the big surprise for me ... That such large numbers of children died at the schools. That the information of their deaths was not communicated back to their families.&quot;

===Missing children and unmarked graves===

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission wrote that the policy of Indian Affairs was to refuse to return the bodies of children home due to the associated expense, and to instead require the schools to bear the cost of burials. The TRC concluded that it may be impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, in part because of the practice of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.
The fourth volume of the TRC&#x27;s final report, dedicated to missing children and unmarked burials, was developed after the original TRC members realized, in 2007, that the issue required its own working group. In 2009, the TRC requested $1.5million in extra funding from the federal government to complete this work, but was denied. The researchers concluded, after searching land near schools using satellite imagery and maps, that, &quot;for the most part, the cemeteries that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to accidental disturbance&quot;.

In May 2021, a possible burial site was found in the Kamloops Indian Residential School in Kamloops, British Columbia, on the lands of the Tkʼemlúps te Secwépemc First Nation. The site was located with the assistance of a ground-penetrating radar specialist and Tk’emlups te Secwepemc Chief Rosanne Casimir wrote that the site was undocumented and that work was underway to determine if related records were held at the Royal British Columbia Museum. As of May 2024, no remains have been excavated.

On June 23, 2021, ground-penetrating radar suggested the presence of an estimated 751 unmarked graves on the site of Marieval Indian Residential School in Marieval, Saskatchewan, on the lands of Cowessess First Nation. Some of these graves predated the establishment of the residential school. On June 24, 2021, Chief Cadmus Delorme of Cowessess First Nation held a virtual press conference. From June 2 to 23 they found an estimated 751 unmarked graves. Delorme went on to state:This is not a mass grave site, these are unmarked graves...in 1960, there may have been marks on these graves. The Catholic Church representatives removed these headstones and today they are unmarked graves... the machine has a 10 to 15 percent error...we do know there is at least 600... We cannot affirm that they are all children, but there are oral stories that there are adults in this gravesite... some may have went to the Church and from our local towns and they could have been buried here as well... We are going to put names on these unmarked graves.

On June 30, 2021, the Lower Kootenay Band reported 182 unmarked graves near Kootenay Indian Residential School in Cranbrook, British Columbia.

==Self-governance and school closure==

When the government revised the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s, some bands, along with regional and national Indigenous organizations, wanted to maintain schools in their communities. Motivations for support of the schools included their role as a social service in communities that were suffering from extensive family breakdowns; the significance of the schools as employers; and the inadequacy of other opportunities for children to receive education.
In the 1960s, a major confrontation took place at the Saddle Lake Reserve in Alberta. After several years of deteriorating conditions and administrative changes, parents protested against the lack of transparency at the Blue Quills Indian School in 1969. In response, the government decided to close the school, convert the building into a residence, and enroll students in a public school away in St. Paul, Alberta. The TRC report pertaining to this period states:

Fearing their children would face racial discrimination in St. Paul, parents wished to see the school transferred to a private society that would operate it both as a school and a residence. The federal government had been open to such a transfer if the First Nations organization was structured as a provincial school division. The First Nations rejected this, saying that a transfer of First Nations education to the provincial authority was a violation of Treaty rights.

In the summer of 1970, members of Saddle Lake Cree Nation occupied the building and demanded the right to run it themselves. More than 1,000 people participated in the 17-day sit-in, which lasted from July 14 to 31. Their efforts resulted in Blue Quills becoming the first Indigenous-administered school in the country. It continues to operate today as University nuhelotʼįne thaiyotsʼį nistameyimâkanak Blue Quills, the first Indigenous-governed university in Canada. Following the success of the Blue Quills effort the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB) released the 1972 paper &quot;Indian Control of Indian Education&quot; that responded, in part, to the Canadian Government&#x27;s 1969 White Paper calling for the abolishment of the land treaties and the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. The NIB paper underscored the right of Indigenous communities to locally direct how their children are educated and served as the integral reference for education policy moving forward.

Few other former residential schools have converted to independently operated community schools for Indigenous children. White Calf Collegiate in Lebret, Saskatchewan, was run by Star Blanket Cree Nation from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969. Old Sun Community College is run by Siksika Nation in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr. From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of Mount Royal College from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the &quot;Old Sun College Act&quot; was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.

==Lasting effects==
Survivors of residential schools and their families have been found to suffer from historical trauma with a lasting and adverse effect on the transmission of Indigenous culture between generations. A 2010 study led by Gwen Reimer explained historic trauma, passed on intergenerationally, as the process through which &quot;cumulative stress and grief experienced by Aboriginal communities is translated into a collective experience of cultural disruption and a collective memory of powerlessness and loss&quot;. This trauma has been used to explain the persistent negative social and cultural impacts of colonial rule and residential schools, including the prevalence of sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, lateral violence, mental illness and suicide among Indigenous peoples.

The 2012 national report of the First Nations Regional Health Study found that respondents who attended residential schools were more likely than those who did not to have been diagnosed with at least one chronic medical condition. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65 per cent have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21 per cent have been diagnosed with major depression; 7 percent have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7 percent have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

In a 2014 article, Anishinaabe psychiatry researcher Amy Bombay reviewed research that relates to the intergenerational effects. She found that, &quot;In addition to negative effects observed among those who attended IRS, accumulating evidence suggests that the children of those who attended (IRS offspring) are also at greater risk for poor well-being.&quot; 37.2% of adults with at least one parent who attended a boarding school contemplated committing suicide in their lifetimes, compared to 25.7% of people whose parents did not attend residential boarding schools. Higher levels of depression symptoms and psychological trauma were evident among Indian residential school survivors&#x27; children.

===Loss of language and culture===
Although some schools permitted students to speak their Indigenous languages, suppressing their languages and culture was a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. The schools strictly prohibited the use of these languages even though many students spoke little to no English or French. Traditional and spiritual activities including the potlatch and Sun Dance were also banned. Some survivors reported being strapped or forced to eat soap when they were caught speaking their own language. The inability to communicate was further affected by their families&#x27; inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed of being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty. Survivors also have to deal with the effects of cultural linguicide, which is defined as loss of language which eventually leads to loss of culture.

The stigma the residential school system created against elders passing Indigenous culture on to younger generations has been linked to the over-representation of Indigenous languages on the list of endangered languages in Canada. The TRC noted that most of the 90 Indigenous languages that still exist are at risk of disappearing, with great-grandparents as the only speakers of many such languages. 
It concluded that a failure of governments and Indigenous communities to prioritize the teaching and preservation of traditional languages ensured that despite the closure of residential schools, the eradication of Indigenous culture desired by government officials and administrators would inevitably be fulfilled &quot;through a process of systematic neglect&quot;. In addition to the forceful eradication of elements of Indigenous culture, the schools trained students in the patriarchal dichotomies then common in British and Canadian society and useful to state institutions, such as the domesticization of female students through imbuing &#x27;stay-at-home&#x27; values and the militarization of male students through soldierlike regimentation.  

However, Indigenous children in boarding schools were not deterred, and continued to speak and practice their language in an attempt to keep it alive. Assistant Professor in Professional Communication, Jane Griffith, said, &quot;Predictably, nineteenth-century government texts do not reveal the strategies Indigenous peoples had for maintaining their languages in the same way Indian boarding school survivor memoir, literature, and testimony do from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This absence may exemplify how school newspapers carefully created an English-only fantasy for readers, but may also attest to the success of students&#x27; secrecy: perhaps official school documents did not report that students still knew Indigenous languages because schools were unaware of this. Government reports, if read contrapuntally, were more forthcoming in how students continued to speak their language, though they framed such resistance as failure.&quot;

===Native resistance===

Boarding schools in Canada worked towards assimilation of Native students. Historians Brian Klopotek and Brenda Child explain, &quot;Education for Indians was not mandatory in Canada until 1920, long after compulsory attendance laws were passed in the United States, although families frequently resisted sending their children to the residential schools. Many protested the lack of decent educational opportunities available, but the government took little action until after World War I, when European-Canadians first began to acknowledge discriminatory treatment towards Indians.&quot; Indigenous resistance is defined, in the words of Anishinaabe scholar-artist Leanne Simpson as &quot;a radical and complete overturning of the nation-state&#x27;s political formations.&quot; During this time Native people found ways to resist this colonial endeavor.

Those that survived used their knowledge to speak back against colonialism, as historians Brian Klopotek and Brenda Child explain, &quot;in Canada, the results of this system were more complicated than the government anticipated. Often students returned to their reserves to become leaders, while others entered the labour market and competed with Euro-American workers.&quot; The Canadian government was displeased with this; as one minister for Indian Affairs noted in 1897, &quot;we are educating these Indians to compete industrially with our own peoples, which seems to me a very undesirable amount of public money.&quot; The government, perceiving Indian education as too generous, reduced the services available to First Nations peoples beginning in 1910 and emphasized low cost schooling thereafter.

==Apologies==
Acknowledgment of the wrongs done by the residential school system began in the 1980s.

===United Church of Canada===
In 1986, the first apology for residential schools by any institution in Canada was from the United Church of Canada in Sudbury, Ontario. At the 1986 31st General Council, the United Church of Canada responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and adopted the apology. Rev. Bob Smith stated:

We imposed our civilization as a condition of accepting the gospel. We tried to make you be like us and in so doing we helped to destroy the vision that made you what you were. As a result, you, and we, are poorer and the image of the Creator in us is twisted, blurred, and we are not what we are meant by God to be. We ask you to forgive us and to walk together with us in the Spirit of Christ so that our peoples may be blessed and God&#x27;s creation healed.

The elders present at the General Council expressly refused to accept the apology and chose to receive the apology, believing further work needed to be done. In 1998, the church apologized expressly for the role it played in the residential school system. On behalf of The United Church of Canada the Right Rev. Bill Phipps stated:

I apologize for the pain and suffering that our church&#x27;s involvement in the Indian Residential School system has caused. We are aware of some of the damage that this cruel and ill-conceived system of assimilation has perpetrated on Canada&#x27;s First Nations peoples. For this we are truly and most humbly sorry... To those individuals who were physically, sexually, and mentally abused as students of the Indian Residential Schools in which The United Church of Canada was involved, I offer you our most sincere apology. You did nothing wrong. You were and are the victims of evil acts that cannot under any circumstances be justified or excused... We are in the midst of a long and painful journey as we reflect on the cries that we did not or would not hear, and how we have behaved as a church...we commit ourselves to work toward ensuring that we will never again use our power as a church to hurt others with attitudes of racial and spiritual superiority. We pray that you will hear the sincerity of our words today and that you will witness the living out of our apology in our actions in the future.

===Roman Catholic Church===

In 1991, at the National Meeting on Indian Residential Schools in Saskatoon, Canadian bishops and leaders of religious orders that participated in the schools issued an apology stating:

We are sorry and deeply regret the pain, suffering and alienation that so many experienced. We have heard their cries of distress, feel their anguish and want to be part of the healing process ... we pledge solidarity with the aboriginal peoples in their pursuit of recognition of their basic human rights ... urge the federal government to assume its responsibility for its part in the Indian Residential Schools ... [and] urge our faith communities to become better informed and more involved in issues important to aboriginal peoples

In July 1991, Douglas Crosby, then presidential of the Oblate of Canada, the missionary religious congregation that operated a majority of the Catholic residential schools in Canada, apologized on behalf of 1,200 Oblates then living in Canada, to approximately 25,000 Indigenous people at Lac Ste. Anne, Alberta, stating:

We apologize for the part we played in the cultural, ethnical, linguistic and religious imperialism that was part of the European mentality and, in a particular way, for the instances of physical and sexual abuse that occurred in these schools ... For these trespasses we wish to voice today our deepest sorrow and we ask your forgiveness and understanding. We hope that we can make up for it being part of the healing process wherever necessary.

Crosby further pledged the need to &quot;come again to that deep trust and solidarity that constitutes families. We recognize that the road beyond past hurt may be long and steep, but we pledge ourselves anew to journey with the Native Peoples on that road.&quot;

On May 16, 1993, in Idaho, Peter Hans Kolvenbach, then Superior General of the Society of Jesus, issued an apology for the actions of Jesuits in the Western missions and in the &quot;ways the church was insensitive toward your tribal customs, language and spirituality ... The Society of Jesus is sorry for the mistakes it has made in the past&quot;.

In 2009, a delegation of 40 First Nations representatives from Canada and several Canadian bishops had a private meeting with Pope Benedict XVI to obtain an apology for abuses that occurred in the residential school system. Then leader of the Assembly of First Nations Grand Chief Phil Fontaine of the First Nations Summit in British Columbia, and Chief Edward John of Tlʼaztʼen Nation were in attendance. The Indigenous delegation were funded by Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. Afterwards, the Holy See released an official expression of sorrow on the church&#x27;s role in residential schools and &quot;the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church&quot;:

His Holiness [the Pope] emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.

Fontaine, a residential school survivor, later stated that he had sensed the pope&#x27;s &quot;pain and anguish&quot; and that the acknowledgement was &quot;important to [him] and that was what [he] was looking for&quot;. In an interview with CBC News, Fontaine stated in regards to the pope&#x27;s acknowledgement of the suffering of the school survivors &quot;I think in that sense, there was that apology that we were certainly looking for.&quot; Many argue that Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s statement was not a full apology. In the 2015 Report from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), Action 58 called for the pope to issue an apology similar to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s 2010 pastoral letter to Ireland issued from the Vatican, but be delivered by the Pope on Canadian soil.

On May 29, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the current Pope Francis for a public apology to all survivors of the residential school system, rather than the expression of sorrow issued by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009. Trudeau invited the pope to issue the apology in Canada. Although no commitment for such an apology followed the meeting, he noted that the pope pointed to a lifelong commitment of supporting marginalized people and an interest in working collaboratively with Trudeau and Canadian bishops to establish a way forward.

On June 10, 2021, a delegation of Indigenous people were announced to meet with the pope later in the year to discuss the legacy of residential schools. On 29 June, the delegation was scheduled to take place from December 17 to 20, 2021, to comply with COVID-19 global travel restrictions. Archbishop Richard Gagnon, president of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops spoke on the topic, stating &quot;What the Pope said and did in Bolivia is what he will do in Canada.&quot;
On September 24, 2021, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a formal apology for residential schools stating &quot;We, the Catholic Bishops of Canada, gathered in Plenary this week, take this opportunity to affirm to you, the Indigenous Peoples of this land, that we acknowledge the suffering experienced in Canada&#x27;s Indian Residential Schools. Many Catholic religious communities and dioceses participated in this system, which led to the suppression of Indigenous languages, culture and spirituality, failing to respect the rich history, traditions and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples. We acknowledge the grave abuses that were committed by some members of our Catholic community; physical, psychological, emotional, spiritual, cultural, and sexual.&quot; Assembly of First Nations Chief RoseAnne Archibald stated she felt conflicted, saying &quot;On one hand, their unequivocal apology is welcomed,&quot; but that she was disappointed that the bishops had not issued a formal request for the pope to visit Canada in person. The Catholic bishops also stated We are fully committed to the process of healing and reconciliation. Together with the many pastoral initiatives already underway in dioceses across the country, and as a further tangible expression of this ongoing commitment, we are pledging to undertake fundraising in each region of the country to support initiatives discerned locally with Indigenous partners. Furthermore, we invite the Indigenous Peoples to journey with us into a new era of reconciliation, helping us in each of our dioceses across the country to prioritize initiatives of healing, to listen to the experience of Indigenous Peoples, especially to the survivors of Indian Residential Schools, and to educate our clergy, consecrated men and women, and lay faithful, on Indigenous cultures and spirituality. We commit ourselves to continue the work of providing documentation or records that will assist in the memorialization of those buried in unmarked graves. The bishops also stated &quot;Pope Francis will encounter and listen to the Indigenous participants, so as to discern how he can support our common desire to renew relationships and walk together along the path of hope in the coming years&quot; with some interpreting this visit as an important step that could lead to a formal visit to Canada by the pope.

On April 1, 2022, during a meeting between a delegation of First Nations representatives and the pope at the Vatican, Pope Francis apologized for the conduct of some members of the Roman Catholic Church in the Canadian Indian residential school system. Pope Francis said:

I also feel shame ... sorrow and shame for the role that a number of Catholics, particularly those with educational responsibilities, have had in all these things that wounded you, and the abuses you suffered and the lack of respect shown for your identity, your culture and even your spiritual values. For the deplorable conduct of these members of the Catholic Church, I ask for God&#x27;s forgiveness and I want to say to you with all my heart, I am very sorry. And I join my brothers, the Canadian bishops, in asking your pardon.

During a July 2022 penitential pilgrimage to western Canada, Pope Francis reiterated the apologies of the Catholic Church, with hundreds of Indigenous people and government officials in attendance, for its members&#x27; role in administrating many of the residential schools on behalf of the government and for abuse that occurred at the hand of Catholic priests and religious sisters. At the Pope&#x27;s apologetic address given at Maskwacis, Chief Wilton Littlechild expressed hope for the future, saying: &quot;You [Pope Francis] have said that you come as a pilgrim, seeking to walk together with us on the pathway of truth, justice, healing, reconciliation, and hope. We gladly welcome you to join us on this journey ... we sincerely hope that our encounter this morning, and the words you share with us, will echo with true healing and real hope throughout many generations to come.&quot; Murray Sinclair, the former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, found the apology &quot;insultingly insufficient&quot;. J.J. McCullough, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, stated, &quot;it was common to complain that the Pope&#x27;s apology was not an institutional apology from the Church as a whole.&quot;

===Anglican===
On August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in Minaki, Ontario. Archbishop Michael Peers apologized to former residential school students on behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada. Almost 30 years later, in April to May, 2022, Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the senior bishop and a principal leader of the Church of England and the ceremonial head of the worldwide Anglican Communion, undertook a five-day visit to Canada, during which he apologized for the &quot;terrible crime&quot; he said the Anglican Church committed in running residential schools and for the Church of England&#x27;s &quot;grievous sins&quot; against the Indigenous peoples of Canada. He continued, &quot;I am so sorry that the Church participated in the attempt—the failed attempt, because you rose above it and conquered it—to dehumanise and abuse those we should have embraced as brothers and sisters.&quot; The Archbishop spent time visiting reserves, meeting with First Nations leaders and Anglicans, and listening to former residential school students.

===Presbyterian===
On June 9, 1994, the Presbyterian Church in Canada adopted a confession at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. The confession was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.We ask, also, for forgiveness from Aboriginal peoples. What we have heard we acknowledge. It is our hope that those whom we have wronged with a hurt too deep for telling will accept what we have to say. With God&#x27;s guidance our Church will seek opportunities to walk with Aboriginal peoples to find healing and wholeness together as God&#x27;s people.

===Canadian government===
====Royal Canadian Mounted Police====
In 2004, immediately before signing the first Public Safety Protocol with the Assembly of First Nations, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner Giuliano Zaccardelli issued an apology on behalf of the RCMP for its role in the Indian residential school system: &quot;We, I, as Commissioner of the RCMP, am truly sorry for what role we played in the residential school system and the abuse that took place in the residential system.&quot;

====Federal Cabinet====
After the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement was accepted by Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s ministry in 2005, activists called for Martin&#x27;s successor, Prime Minister Stephen Harper, to apologize. The Cabinet headed by Harper refused, stating an apology was not part of the agreement. On May 1, 2007, Member of Parliament Gary Merasty, of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation, introduced a motion for an apology, which passed unanimously.

On June 11, 2008, Harper issued a symbolic apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet for past ministries&#x27; policies of assimilation. He did this in front of an audience of Indigenous delegates and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the CBC. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a committee of the whole was used so that Indigenous leaders, who were not members of parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the house.

Harper&#x27;s apology excluded Newfoundland and Labrador on the basis that the 28th Canadian Ministry should not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in St Anthony, Cartwright, North West River, Nain, and Makkovik. These schools were run by the International Grenfell Association and the German Moravian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created under the auspices of the Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1,000 former students disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. Lawyers expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered an apology to Innu, Inuit, and NunatuKavut former students and their families in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Labrador. He acknowledged that students experienced multiple forms of abuse linking their treatment to the colonial thinking that shaped the school system. Trudeau&#x27;s apology was received on behalf of residential school survivors by Toby Obed, who framed the apology as a key part of the healing process that connected survivors from Newfoundland and Labrador with school attendees from across the country. Members of the Innu nation were less receptive, rejecting the apology ahead of the ceremony. Grand Chief Gregory Rich noted in a released statement that he was &quot;not satisfied that Canada understands yet what it has done to Innu and what it is still doing&quot;, indicating that members felt they deserved an apology for more than their experiences at residential schools.

====Provincial====
Then-Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger became, on June 18, 2015, the first politician to issue an apology for past cabinets&#x27; role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action—including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation, and counselling for victims—must accompany words for them to have real meaning.

The Premier of Alberta at the time, Rachel Notley, issued an apology as a ministerial statement on June 22, 2015, in a bid to begin to address the wrongs done by the province&#x27;s previous ministries to the Indigenous peoples of Alberta and the rest of Canada. At the same time, Notley called on the federal government to hold an inquiry on the missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada. The Premier also stated her intent for the government to build relationships with provincial leaders of Indigenous communities and sought to amend the provincial curriculum to include the history of Indigenous culture.

In the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, on May 30, 2016, the serving Premier of Ontario, Kathleen Wynne, apologized on behalf of the Executive Council for the harm done at residential schools. Affirming Ontario&#x27;s commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples, she acknowledged the school system as &quot;one of the most shameful chapters in Canadian history&quot;. In a 105-minute ceremony, Wynne announced that the Ontario government would spend $250million on education initiatives and would also rename the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs the Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. It was further announced that the first week of November would be known as Treaties Recognition Week.

====Calls for the monarch to apologize====
The Manitoba Keewatinook Ininew Okimowin Tribal Council, representing 30 northern Manitoba Indigenous communities, requested on February 21, 2008, that Queen Elizabeth II apologise for the residential schools in Canada. Grand Chief of the council Sydney Garrioch sent a letter with this request to Buckingham Palace.

In Winnipeg, on Canada Day, July 1, 2021, the statue of Queen Victoria in front of the Manitoba Legislative Building, and that of Queen Elizabeth II in the garden of nearby Government House, were vandalized and toppled; the head of the Queen Victoria statue was removed and thrown into the Assiniboine River. Following this event, associate professor of sociology at the University of Winnipeg Kimberley Ducey called for Queen Elizabeth II to apologize for the role of the British monarchy in the establishment of residential schools, though sovereigns since George III have had their powers constrained by the tenets of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, meaning they had no direct responsibility in residential school policy.
On Canada&#x27;s first National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, on September 30, 2021, Elizabeth, as Queen of Canada, said she &quot;joins with all Canadians ... to reflect on the painful history that Indigenous peoples endured in residential schools in Canada and on the work that remains to heal and to continue to build an inclusive society&quot;. The same year, the Queen appointed Mary Simon to represent her as governor general; Simon is the first Indigenous person to occupy the office. The Queen and Simon met in March 2022, after which the vicereine said to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, &quot;we talked about reconciliation and I did talk about the need for healing in our country and to have a better understanding and a better relationship between Indigenous people and other Canadians&quot; and she felt the Queen was well informed on issues affecting Canada.

In his first speech of his royal tour in 2022, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (Elizabeth II&#x27;s eldest son and then-heir to the Canadian Crown), said that it was an &quot;important moment, with &quot;Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples across Canada committing to reflect honestly and openly on the past, and to forge a new relationship for the future&quot;. The Prince and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, participated in moments of reflection and prayer, first with Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador Judy Foote and Indigenous leaders at Heart Garden—which had been opened on the grounds of the provincial Government House in 2019, in memory of former residential school students—and, two days later, at the Ceremonial Circle in the Dene community of Dettah, Northwest Territories, where they also participated in an opening prayer, a drumming circle, and a feeding the fire ceremony. Elisabeth Penashue, an elder of the Sheshatshiu Innu First Nation in Labrador, said it was &quot;really important they hear our stories&quot;.

At a reception hosted by the Governor General at Rideau Hall, in Ottawa, RoseAnne Archibald, National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, appealed directly to the Prince for an apology from the Queen in her capacity as monarch and head of the Church of England for the wrongful acts committed in the past by the Crown and the church in relation to Indigenous peoples. (The Archbishop of Canterbury had, though, already apologized on behalf of the Church of England in April of that year.) Archibald said that the Prince &quot;acknowledged&quot; failures by Canadian governments in handling the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous people, which she said &quot;really meant something&quot;. Royal correspondent Sarah Campbell noted, &quot;on this brief tour, there has been no shying away from acknowledging and highlighting the scandalous way many indigenous peoples have been treated in Canada.&quot;
Queen Elizabeth II died on September 8, 2022, upon which Charles acceded to the Canadian throne. Two days before Charles&#x27; coronation on 6 May 2023, Simon organized a meeting between herself, the King, Archibald, President of the Métis National Council Cassidy Caron, and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami President Natan Obed, all of whom also attended the coronation. Afterward, Caron recounted that she raised the issue of recognition for Métis residential school survivors, who were not included in the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement and were not given a symbolic apology from the prime minister. Archibald said she remained hopeful the King would apologize for colonization and the Church of England&#x27;s role in the residential school system. Simon told CTV News she was not certain there would be an apology and that she put more value in action, elaborating, &quot;an apology is words, and it makes people feel good and deal with their trauma to some extent. But, if you don&#x27;t have any action after that, it stays static&quot;.

===Universities===
On October 27, 2011, University of Manitoba president David Barnard apologized to the TRC for the institution&#x27;s role in educating people who operated the residential school system. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; believed it to be the first time a Canadian university has apologized for playing a role in residential schools.

On April 9, 2018, the University of British Columbia (UBC) opened the Indian Residential School History and Dialogue Centre as a West Coast complement to the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation in Winnipeg. At the opening, UBC President Santa Ono apologized to residential school victims and dignitaries including Grand Chief Edward John and Canadian Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould. Ono apologised for UBC&#x27;s training of policymakers and administrators who operated the system and stated:

On behalf of the university and all its people, I apologize to all of you who are survivors of the residential schools, to your families and communities and to all Indigenous people for the role this university played in perpetuating that system...We apologize for the actions and inaction of our predecessors and renew our commitment to working with all of you for a more just and equitable future.

==Reconciliation==

In the summer of 1990, the Mohawks of Kanesatake confronted the government about its failure to honour Indigenous land claims and recognize traditional Mohawk territory in Oka, Quebec. Referred to by media outlets as the Oka Crisis, the land dispute sparked a critical discussion about the Canadian government&#x27;s complacency regarding relations with Indigenous communities and responses to their concerns. The action prompted then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to underscore four government responsibilities: &quot;resolving land claims; improving the economic and social conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada&#x27;s aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life.&quot; The actions of the Mohawk community members led to, in part, along with objections from Indigenous leaders regarding the Meech Lake Accord, the creation of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples to examine the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission presented a final report which first included a vision for meaningful and action-based reconciliation.

===Ecclesiastical projects===
In 1975, the Anglican, Roman Catholic and United Churches, along with six other churches, formed Project North, later known as the Aboriginal Rights Coalition (ARC), with the objective of &quot;transformation of the relationship between Canadian society and Aboriginal peoples.&quot; The campaign&#x27;s objectives were:

* &quot;The recognition of Aboriginal land and treaty rights in Canada;
* Realizing the historic rights of Aboriginal peoples as they are recognized in the Canadian constitution and upheld in the courts, including the right to self-determination
* Reversing the erosion of social rights, including rights to adequate housing, education, health care and appropriate legal systems;
* Seeking reconciliation between Aboriginal peoples, the Christian community and Canadian society;
* Clarifying the moral and spiritual basis for action towards Aboriginal and social justice in Canada;
* Opposing development and military projects that threaten Aboriginal communities and the environment; and
* Promoting Aboriginal justice within Jubilee.&quot;

The churches have also engaged in reconciliation initiatives such as the Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health organizations such as the AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.

In 1992, The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund for Healing and Reconciliation to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. From 1992 to 2007, the fund funded over $8 million towards 705 projects.

In October 1997, the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB) agreed on the establishment of the Council for Reconciliation, Solidarity and Communion for the following year. In 2007, the council became the Catholic Aboriginal Council. On November 30, 1999, the CCCB signed an agreement with the Assembly of First Nations, represented by Grand Chief Phil Fontaine.

In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing &amp; Reconciliation Program.

===Financial compensation===
In January 1998, the government made a &quot;statement of reconciliation&quot; – including an apology to those people who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools – and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.

In June 2001, the government established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada as an independent government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched as part of a larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation. As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a &quot;voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without having to go through the civil litigation process&quot;. It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full amount of compensation without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be &quot;an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence&quot;. Within a month of the report&#x27;s release a Supreme Court of Canada decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.

On November 23, 2005, the Canadian government announced a $1.9-billion compensation package to benefit tens of thousands of former students. National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover &quot;decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities&quot;. Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was &quot;the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history&quot;. At an Ottawa news conference, Deputy Prime Minister Anne McLellan said: &quot;We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what I firmly believe will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy.&quot;

The compensation package led to the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), announced on May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, as well as an individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was based on the number of years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.

The IRSSA also included the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), a case-by-case, out-of-court resolution process designed to provide compensation for sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The IAP process was built on the ADR program and all IAP claims from former students are examined by an adjudicator. The IAP became available to all former students of residential schools on September 19, 2007. Former students who experienced abuse and wished to pursue compensation had to apply by themselves or through a lawyer of their choice to receive consideration. The deadline to apply for the IAP was September 19, 2012. This gave former students of residential schools four years from the implementation date of the IRSSA to apply for the IAP. Claims involving physical and sexual abuse were compensated up to $275,000. By September 30, 2016, the IAP had resolved 36,538 claims and paid $3.1billion in compensation.

The IRSSA also proposed an advance payment for former students alive and who were 65 years old and over as of May 30, 2005. The deadline for reception of the advance payment form by IRSRC was December 31, 2006. Following a legal process, including an examination of the IRSSA by the courts of the provinces and territories of Canada, an &quot;opt-out&quot; period occurred. During this time, the former students of residential schools could reject the agreement if they did not agree with its dispositions. This opt-out period ended on August 20, 2007, with about 350 former students opting out. The IRSSA was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history. By December 2012, a total of $1.62billion was paid to 78,750 former students, 98 per cent of the 80,000 who were eligible. In 2014, the IRSSA funds left over from CEPs were offered for educational credits for survivors and their families.

===Truth and Reconciliation Commission===
In 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to travel across Canada collecting the testimonies of people affected by the residential school system. About 7,000 Indigenous people told their stories. The TRC concluded in 2015 with the publication of a six volume, 4,000-plus-page report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. It resulted in the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.

The executive summary of the TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be difficult to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.

Among the 94 Calls to Action that accompanied the conclusion of the TRC were recommendations to ensure that all Canadians are educated and made aware of the residential school system. Justice Murray Sinclair explained that the recommendations were not aimed solely at prompting government action, but instead a collective move toward reconciliation in which all Canadians have a role to play: &quot;Many of our elements, many of our recommendations and many of the Calls to Action are actually aimed at Canadian society.&quot;

Preservation of documentation of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted as part of the TRC&#x27;s Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.

In March 2017, Lynn Beyak, a Conservative member of the Senate Standing Committee of Aboriginal Peoples, voiced disapproval of the final TRC report, saying that it had omitted the positives of the schools. Although Beyak&#x27;s right to free speech was defended by some Conservative senators, her comments were widely criticized by members of the opposition, among them Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs, Carolyn Bennett, and leader of the New Democratic Party, Tom Mulcair. The Anglican Church also raised concerns stating in a release co-signed by bishops Fred Hiltz and Mark MacDonald: &quot;There was nothing good about children going missing and no report being filed. There was nothing good about burying children in unmarked graves far from their ancestral homes.&quot; In response, the Conservative Party leadership removed Beyak from the Senate committee underscoring that her comments did not align with the views of the party.

===Educational initiatives===

Education or awareness of the residential school system or its abuses is low among Canadians. A 2020 survey suggested that nearly half of Canadians never learned about the residential schools when they were students, with 34% of those who were taught by teachers being provided a positive assessment. Another poll conducted in 2021 showed that only 10% of Canadians were very familiar with the history of the residential school system and that 68% say they were unaware of the severity of abuses or completely shocked by it, and that so many children could die. A majority of Canadians believe that educational provincial curricula does not include enough about residential schools, that the education level should increase, and that the framing of the residential school system has been downplayed in the education system.

For many communities the buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic reminder of the system&#x27;s legacy; demolition, heritage status and the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process have been discussed. In July 2016, it was announced that the building of the former Mohawk Institute Residential School would be converted into an educational centre with exhibits on the legacy of residential schools. Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, David Zimmer, noted: &quot;Its presence will always be a reminder of colonization and the racism of the residential school system; one of the darkest chapters of Canadian history.&quot;

Reconciliation efforts have also been undertaken by several Canadian universities. In 2015 Lakehead University and the University of Winnipeg introduced a mandatory course requirement for all undergraduate students focused on Indigenous culture and history. The same year the University of Saskatchewan hosted a two-day national forum at which Canadian university administrators, scholars and members of Indigenous communities discussed how Canadian universities can and should respond to the TRC&#x27;s Calls to Action.

On April 1, 2017, a pole, titled &quot;Reconciliation Pole&quot;, was raised on the grounds of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Vancouver campus. Carved by Haida master carver and hereditary chief, 7idansuu () (Edenshaw), James Hart, the pole tells the story of the residential school system prior to, during and after its operation. It features thousands of copper nails, used to represent the children who died in Canadian residential schools, and depictions of residential school survivors carved by artists from multiple Indigenous communities, including Canadian Inuk director Zacharias Kunuk, Maliseet artist Shane Perley-Dutcher, and Muqueam Coast Salish artist Susan Point.

In October 2016, Canadian singer-songwriter Gord Downie released &quot;Secret Path&quot;, a concept album about Chanie Wenjack&#x27;s escape and death. It was accompanied by a graphic novel and animated film, aired on CBC Television. Proceeds went to the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie&#x27;s brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers who had used the material in their classrooms, and hoped to continue this. In December 2017, Downie was posthumously named Canadian Newsmaker of the Year by the Canadian Press, in part because of his work with reconciliation efforts for survivors of residential schools.

===National Day for Truth and Reconciliation===

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission&#x27;s 80th call to action was for the government to designate a National Day for Truth and Reconciliation that would become a statutory holiday to honour the survivors, their families, and communities. In August 2018, the government announced it was considering three possible dates as the new national holiday. After consultation, Orange Shirt Day was selected as the holiday.

Orange Shirt Day pre-existed the government&#x27;s efforts to make it a holiday. The day started in 2013, when at a residential school reunion, survivor Phyllis Jack Webstad told her story. She recounted how her grandmother bought her a new orange shirt to go to school in, and when she arrived at the residential school, the shirt was stripped away from her and never returned. The other survivors founded the SJM Project, and on September 30, 2013—the time of the year when Indigenous children were taken away to residential schools—they encouraged students in schools in the area to wear an orange shirt in memory of the victims of the residential school system. The observance of the holiday spread quickly across Canada, and in 2017 the Canadian government encouraged all Canadians to participate in the observance of Orange Shirt Day.

On March 21, 2019, Georgina Jolibois submitted a private member&#x27;s bill to call for Orange Shirt Day to become a statutory holiday; the bill passed the House of Commons, but the next election was called before the bill could pass the Senate and become law. After the election, Steven Guilbeault reintroduced the bill to make Orange Shirt Day a national statutory holiday. Following the discovery of 215 unmarked anomalies on the grounds of the former Kamloops Indian Residential School on May 24, 2021, Parliament agreed to pass the bill unanimously, and the bill received royal assent on June 3, 2021.

During the 2022 National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill, as well as buildings across Canada, were illuminated to honour those affected by the Canadian residential school system. They were lit up in orange throughout the evening of September 30, 2022, from 7:00pm until sunrise.

<text>GnuTLS (, the GNU Transport Layer Security Library) is a free software implementation of the TLS, SSL and DTLS protocols. It offers an application programming interface (API) for applications to enable secure communication over the network transport layer, as well as interfaces to access X.509, PKCS #12, OpenPGP and other structures.

== Features ==
GnuTLS consists of a library that allows client applications to start secure sessions using the available protocols.
It also provides command-line tools, including an X.509 certificate manager, a test client and server, and random key and password generators.

GnuTLS has the following features:
* TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0, and SSL 3.0 protocols
* Datagram TLS (DTLS) 1.2, and DTLS 1.0, protocols
* TLS-SRP: Secure remote password protocol (SRP) for TLS authentication
* TLS-PSK: Pre-shared key (PSK) for TLS authentication
* X.509 and OpenPGP certificate handling
* CPU assisted cryptography and cryptographic accelerator support (/dev/crypto), VIA PadLock and AES-NI instruction sets
* Support for smart cards and for hardware security modules
* Storage of cryptographic keys in the system&#x27;s Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

== History ==

=== Origin ===
GnuTLS was initially created around March to November 2000, by Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos to allow applications of the GNU Project to use secure protocols such as TLS. Although OpenSSL already existed, OpenSSL&#x27;s license is not compatible with the GPL; thus software under the GPL, such as GNU software, could not use OpenSSL without making a GPL linking exception.

=== License ===
The GnuTLS library was licensed originally under the GNU Lesser General Public License v2, while included applications to use the GNU General Public License.

In August 2011 the library was updated to the LGPLv3. After it was noticed that there were new license compatibility problems introduced, especially with other free software with the license change, after discussions the license was downgraded again to LGPLv2.1 in March 2013.

=== Split from GNU ===
GnuTLS was created for the GNU Project, but in December 2012 its maintainer, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, dissociated the project from GNU after policy disputes with the Free Software Foundation. Richard Stallman opposed this move and suggested forking the project instead. Soon afterward, developer Paolo Bonzini ended his maintainership of GNU Sed and Grep, expressing concerns similar to those of GnuTLS maintainer Mavrogiannopoulos.

== Deployment ==

Software packages using GnuTLS include(d):

* GNOME
* CenterIM
* Exim
* WeeChat
* Mutt
* Wireshark
* slrn
* Lynx
* CUPS
* gnoMint
* GNU Emacs
* Synology DiskStation Manager
* OpenConnect

<text>Zöllner is a lunar impact crater located to the west of Sinus Asperitatis. It was named after German astrophysicist and astronomer Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner. To the north is the smaller crater Alfraganus and to the northwest lies the oval-shaped Taylor. Southeast of Zöllner is the smaller crater Kant.

The rim of Zöllner forms an irregular oval, with the formation being longer in a north–south direction. The wall is low and worn, with a distorted, crater-like depression attached to the southeast of the rim. The narrow floor still retains a central peak.

The Apollo 16 landing site is located about 80 kilometers west-southwest of the crater rim.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zöllner.

<doc id="949760" wikidata="Q833775" url="?curid=949760" title="The Hollow">
<text>The Hollow is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the United States by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. in 1946 and in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club in November of the same year. The US edition retailed at $2.50 and the UK edition at eight shillings and sixpence (8/6). A paperback edition in the US by Dell Books in 1954 changed the title to Murder after Hours.

The novel is an example of a &quot;country house mystery&quot; and was the first of her novels in four years to feature the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot—one of the longest gaps in the entire series. Agatha Christie, who often admitted that she did not like Poirot (a fact parodied by her recurring novelist character Ariadne Oliver), particularly disliked his appearance in this novel. His late arrival, jarring, given the established atmosphere, led her to claim in her &quot;Autobiography&quot; that she ruined the novel by the introduction of Poirot.
Agatha Christie&#x27;s successful career foresaw the use of her eight owned houses as settings for her novels, which were &quot;Taken at the Flood&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Folly&quot;, &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot;, &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot;, and &quot;Crooked House&quot;. However, the setting for &quot;The Hollow&quot; was inspired by Francis L. Sullivan&#x27;s house. Francis Loftus Sullivan was an English film and stage actor who portrayed Hercule Poirot in the plays &quot;Black Coffee&quot; (1930) and &quot;Peril at End House&quot; (1932) and also played the lead in &quot;The Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1953), for which he won a Tony Award in 1955.

== Plot ==

=== Introduction ===
Dr John Christow is a successful physician and leading researcher, although very tired and irritated by his current life. On the morning that he and his downtrodden wife, Gerda, are due to travel down to the country to weekend with friends, Christow allows his little daughter to tell his fortune with cards. When the death card is drawn, he pays no attention, but the appearance of an old flame at The Hollow seems to be the final link in a chain of fatal circumstances.

=== Summary ===
The eccentric Lucy Angkatell has invited the Christows, along with other members of her extended family, to her estate for the weekend. John Christow is carrying on an affair with Henrietta Savernake, a talented sculptor. The beautiful Veronica Cray, an old flame of Christow&#x27;s, suddenly appears in the house on Saturday night to borrow a box of matches. She lives at a nearby cottage. Another cottage is occupied by Hercule Poirot, who has been invited for Sunday lunch.
John walks Veronica back to her cottage, and returns home at 3 am. The next day, Poirot is witness to a scene that seems strangely staged. Gerda Christow stands with a gun in her hand next to John&#x27;s body, as it bleeds into the swimming pool. Lucy, Henrietta, and Edward (a cousin of Lucy&#x27;s and a second cousin of Henrietta) are also present at the scene. John utters a final urgent appeal, &quot;Henrietta&quot;, and dies.

It seems obvious that Gerda is the murderer. Henrietta steps forward to take the revolver from her hand, but apparently fumbles and drops it into the swimming pool, destroying the evidence. However, the pistol that Gerda was holding was not the gun used to kill John. None of the witnesses has seen Gerda shoot John. It seems difficult to build a case against any of the other potential suspects. Lucy was the next suspect, as she kept a pistol concealed in her basket of eggs. However, the pistol was the wrong calibre. Henrietta is the next suspect, having left an unusual doodle in the pavilion around the time John was killed. When the murder weapon turns up in Poirot&#x27;s hedge, it has fingerprints that match none of the suspects.

The family had deliberately misdirected Poirot, as they each knew Gerda was the murderer, and were attempting to save her from imprisonment. Gerda had taken two pistols – shooting John with one, and then planning to be discovered with the other pistol in her hand, later proven not to be the murder weapon. Immediately, Henrietta understood that John&#x27;s final appeal was for her to help Gerda. Instinctively, Henrietta assumed the responsibility by dropping the gun into the pool, and later goes back to retrieve the second weapon. She hides it in a clay sculpture of a horse in her workshop to avoid the police searches. Later, she gets it handled by a blind match-seller and then places it in Poirot&#x27;s hedge.

Midge Hardcastle, a less affluent relative of the Angkatells, is also staying at the house. She is in love with Edward, but Edward has always been in love with Henrietta, who had refused several of his marriage proposals. Edward comes to the realisation that Henrietta is no longer the Henrietta he once loved. He looks at Midge and realises that she is no longer &quot;little Midge&quot;. Edward asks her to marry him. He goes for a walk with Midge, but coming to a spot where Edward has previously walked with Henrietta, Midge believes that he is still too deeply in love with Henrietta. So, she calls off the wedding.

Edward does not understand that Midge loves him too much to hold him back from Henrietta. Misunderstanding her decision, he attempts suicide by putting his head in a gas oven but he is saved by Midge. With this dramatic proof of his despair at losing her, she relents and the wedding is on again.

With the evidence apparently destroyed or suitably confused, the family believe they have saved Gerda. There is a final clue: the holster in which the murder weapon was kept. Gerda had cut this up and placed it in her workbag. Henrietta rushes to Gerda in an attempt to retrieve it and destroy the final proof of Gerda&#x27;s guilt.

Poirot arrives, and rearranges the tea cups before Gerda returns from the kitchen. He suspects the cornered and suspicious Gerda would murder Henrietta. Gerda returns and drinks from the cup intended for Henrietta, and dies. Henrietta seeks closure and visits one of John&#x27;s patients. John&#x27;s death ended the hope of a cure but she is still showing a resilient spirit. Leaving the hospital, she reflects that there is no happy ending for her. She resolves to embark on a sculpture of herself as &quot;Grief&quot;.

== Characters ==
* Hercule Poirot, renowned Belgian detective
* Inspector Grange, the investigating officer
* Sergeant Clark, a policeman in the case
* Dr John Christow, a Harley Street doctor. He is passionate about his work and dedicates himself to finding a cure for &quot;Ridgeway&#x27;s disease&quot; – the aetiology of which bears a marked resemblance to multiple sclerosis. He is very self-confident, attractive, and has great charisma.
* Gerda Christow, John&#x27;s wife. She is rather plain and gives the impression of being clumsy; she worries about everything. She idealises John, and blames herself for her problems, even when it is he who is wrong. She inspired a sculpture by Henrietta called &quot;The Worshipper&quot;, which is described as being frightening as it has no face.
* Sir Henry Angkatell, the owner of The Hollow. He married his distant cousin, Lucy Angkatell.
* Edward Angkatell, a distant cousin of Henry and entailee of the family&#x27;s beloved house, Ainswick. He has charm but is overshadowed by Christow&#x27;s dominant personality. He lives in the past and has been devoted to Henrietta for many years. He despises himself, thinking he is good for nothing.
* Lucy, Lady Angkatell, Henry&#x27;s wife, whose sociable, charismatic veneer hides a dark side to her personality, occasionally glimpsed by her family.
* Midge Hardcastle, Lucy&#x27;s young cousin. Related to the Angkatell family through her mother, she refuses financial aid from them and works in a dressmaker&#x27;s shop.
* David Angkatell, a student. Bookish, anti-social, and possessor of &quot;modern&quot; ideas regarding the working class. He tries to express an air of superiority.
* Henrietta Savernake, a sculptor, and cousin of Sir Henry, Lucy, Midge, Edward and David. She always knows the right words to say to make someone feel comfortable, albeit sometimes at the expense of the truth. Her art is the core of her being, which, at times, conflicts with her second important characteristic.
* Veronica Cray, an actress. She is very beautiful and abnormally egotistical. She wanted Christow to abandon everything to follow her to Hollywood, but he rejected her; she found this unbearable. However, Christow is still attracted to her and, it is implied, had a one-night stand with her, which triggered Gerda&#x27;s jealousy.
* Gudgeon, the butler; he is very protective of Lady Angkatell.
* Doris, the house maid
* Beryl Collins, John&#x27;s secretary.
* Mrs Crabtree, a patient of John&#x27;s, a victim of Ridgeway&#x27;s Disease.
* Terence, John and Gerda&#x27;s twelve-year-old son; perceptive, observant, analytical, curious and lonely.
* Zena, John and Gerda&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter.

== Literary significance and reception ==
Maurice Richardson, in the 1 December 1946 issue of &quot;The Observer&quot;, wrote: &quot;Agatha Christie has staged, against her smartest, most hyperemotional background so far, the shooting of a philandering doctor. Solution by a rather subdued Poirot. Good double-bluff surprise.&quot;

Robert Barnard: &quot;Notable specimen, with more complex characterization than usual, and occasionally rising to wit (especially on the subject of cooking). Illustrates vividly one dilemma of the detective writer: if you establish characters of some psychological complexity, how do you prevent the routine detection stuff coming as an anticlimax? Christie records that her daughter protested against her decision to dramatize the book, and the instinct was probably right: most of the interest here, unusually, is internal, and difficult to present via Christie&#x27;s rather old-fashioned stage techniques. Definitely among the top ten, in spite of the falling-off in the second half.&quot;

Modern French novelist Michel Houellebecq, an admirer of the book, described it in his 2001 novel &quot;Platform&quot; as &quot;a strange, poignant book; these are deep waters [she writes about], with powerful undercurrents.&quot;

== Film, TV or theatrical adaptations ==
=== Stage play ===

Christie adapted the book into a highly successful stage play in 1951 but omitted Poirot from the narrative.

=== British television movie ===
In 2004, the novel was broadcast as a television movie featuring David Suchet as Poirot, Sarah Miles as Lady Angkatell, Megan Dodds as Henrietta Savernake, Jonathan Cake as John Christow, Lysette Anthony as Veronica Cray and Edward Fox as Gudgeon, as part of the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;.

The character of David Angkatell and some details are omitted (for example, the drawing of the card representing death). Others – such as the dénouement involving poisoned tea – are altered (Gerda instead deliberately commits suicide by injecting herself with potassium cyanide).

=== French television episode ===
A French adaptation as part of the television series &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot; was broadcast in 2021 Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie#Series Three: 1970s France.

<text>The Hoorn–Medemblik heritage railway operated by the &quot;Museumstoomtram Hoorn Medemblik&quot; is a heritage railway in the Netherlands. It runs from Hoorn to Medemblik, a distance of about .

== History ==

The original railway line was operated by &quot;Locaalspoorwegmaatschappij Hollands Noorderkwartier&quot; (1884 - 1935). The line was opened on 3 November 1887. The track followed a circuitous route to reduce the amount of land that had to be compulsorily purchased. The line used steam traction; diesel traction being introduced in 1929.

The line was closed to passenger services from 1 January 1936 to 29 May 1940.

On 5 January 1941 the line was permanently closed to passenger services; as was the railway station in Medemblik.

== Heritage railway ==
Today, the railway is operated as a tourist attraction. The centrepiece of its collection is the former Nederlandse Spoorwegen locomotive 7742 &quot;Bello&quot;, the only preserved light steam engine in the Netherlands. Other steam locomotives in running order include three tramway engines, two of which are enclosed tram engines (steam dummies).
The remaining ones are: three industrial engines; a German engine which is rebuilt as a replica of a Dutch railway shunting engine (of a series of which several also served on steam tramways); and a locomotive of industrial type which served at a steam tram company in Zuid-Holland, still awaiting restoration. One of the industrial locomotives is on a long-term loan to .

Seven of the ten steam locomotives are official Dutch railway monuments.

NS 7742 and the two enclosed tram engines are in regular use: &quot;Bello&quot; mainly in the peak season afternoon train. The regular 10.40 am train is pulled by tramloco LTM 26. The two steam dummies mainly in the peak season (Tue/Wed/Thu).

Eight steam tram carriages are in regular service, as well as several steam tram goods wagons.

Bello and the three tramway engines originate from the provinces North Holland, South Holland and Limburg.
The serviceable steam tram carriages originate from the provinces Friesland, Gelderland, North Holland, South Holland and Zeeland.

The livery and presentation of the cars is as they were in 1926.

The station is twinned with the Bluebell Railway in England. The ride between Hoorn and Medemblik is often combined by tourists with a trip from Medemblik to Enkhuizen by boat.

On the disused side of platform 2 of Huddersfield railway station in northern England, an old carriage is bolted to the ground, and set in its window is a Dutch plaque commemorating 100 years of Stoomtram Hoorn - Medemblik.

==Film==
The railway was used as film location for the 1979 movie &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;: the station building of &#x27;Emden&#x27; was in fact Medemblik, and Twisk was used to represent &#x27;Bensersiel&#x27;.

==Video of locomotive 7742 in action==

Locomotive 7742 is featured in a video by the Netherlands music group BZN as they perform &#x27;Poor Old Joe&#x27;.

<text>Messiah is a British television drama series, broadcast on the BBC One network and is produced as a co-production between BBC Northern Ireland (although the series itself is set in England) and Paramount International Television. Made up of a series of occasional serials, the first, with two parts subtitled &quot;The First Killings&quot; &amp; &quot;The Reckoning&quot;, was broadcast in 2001. It has been followed by &quot;Messiah 2: Vengeance is Mine&quot; (2003), &quot;Messiah III: The Promise&quot; (2004), &quot;Messiah IV: The Harrowing&quot; (2005) and most recently &quot;Messiah V: The Rapture&quot; (2008). The original production was based on a novel by Boris Starling: the subsequent instalments have been written directly for television. Starling has a cameo as a murder victim&#x27;s corpse in the first serial.

A crime series, it follows the investigations of DCI Red Metcalfe, who often investigates particularly gruesome murders. Metcalfe is played by Scottish actor Ken Stott, and the other main regulars in the series are Kate Beauchamp (Frances Grey), Duncan Warren (Neil Dudgeon) and Metcalfe&#x27;s wife Susan (Michelle Forbes). The deafness of Forbes&#x27; character necessitated both her and Stott learning British Sign Language for their characters&#x27; frequent exchanges.

==Production==
&quot;Messiah I&quot; is the only series to be directly adapted from the novel, and deals with a serial killer who sets out to commit twelve murders in the same vein as the Apostles. The screenplay was written by Lizzie Mickery, who also wrote &quot;Messiah II&quot; and &quot;Messiah III&quot;. The series was broadcast over a May bank holiday weekend in 2001, on 26 (Saturday) and 27 (Sunday) May respectively. The series does have some major differences to the novel it was adapted from. For example; the final scenes in the novel take place at Easter 1999, traditionally the time when Judas Iscariot hanged himself. However, the events of the final scenes in the series take place on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2000. In the novel, Red is seen crashing to the floor with his killer before crucifying them, similar to the death of Jesus Christ. However, in the series, Red&#x27;s killer tries to hang him from his staircase, before Red and his wife manage to overpower him and he falls to his death from a great height. The way in which the killer falls to their death results in them lying on the floor in the shape of a cross. Red meanwhile manages to pull himself to safety. In the novel, Red hands himself in to the police having committed murder, is interviewed by DS Beauchamp and is subsequently sent to jail. However, in the series, Red is seen simply being taken away in a police car to give his side of the story as to how his killer died. Subsequently, he is found to have been at no fault, thus paving the way for the further serials. The novel also shows Red&#x27;s marriage to his wife, Susan, falling apart and their subsequent split; however, in the series, this does not occur, and Susan appears in two further sequels. Also, it can be noted that the character of Susan is not deaf in the book, but is in the series.

&quot;Messiah II&quot; was the first original screenplay written for the series, again written by Lizzie Mickery. The plot deals with a serial killer who murders all those implicated in the wrongful imprisonment of their father. The serial was originally scheduled for broadcast on the August bank holiday weekend of 2002, 24 and 25 August respectively, but was pulled at the last moment because of the Soham Murders; it was eventually broadcast in 2003, on 11 and 12 January respectively. Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Fortune plango vulnera&quot; and &quot;O Fortuna&quot; were used as trailer music for the series.

&quot;Messiah III&quot; was again written by Lizzie Mickery. The plot deals with a prison riot, during which a member of Red&#x27;s team is held hostage and almost killed. A killer then begins to pick off everyone who threatened or harmed that officer. The series was again broadcast across an August bank holiday weekend, being broadcast on 30 and 31 August 2004 respectively. The first two pieces of Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; are used in the trailer for the series.

&quot;Messiah IV&quot; was for the first time written by Terry Cafolla. The plot deals with a killer who commits a series of elaborate and strange murders based around the killings of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante. The series was once again broadcast across an August bank holiday, but for the first time was split into three parts, being broadcast on 28, 29 and 30 August 2005 respectively.

&quot;Messiah V&quot; sees Marc Warren take over as lead actor in the series, appearing as new character DCI Joseph Walker. The series, although loosely connected with the four original series, features an entirely new cast, new writer (this series having been written by Oliver Brown), and largely new format. The plot of this series centres around a massacre in a crack den, followed by an acid attack, the murder of two sisters and a victim discovers with a missing heart. The series was broadcast in January 2008, on 20 and 21 January respectively. The first part of the serial was generally positively received by critics, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stating that despite the show lacking the shock value it had when it first started, the variations on the theme are enough to keep it going, and the directing and pacing remained good. &quot;The Herald&quot; called the show &#x27;stylishly realised&#x27;, though also asked why professional detectives would need a priest to figure out the serial killer was sending an apocalyptic message. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the plot &#x27;totally loopy&#x27; but done well, as well as being frightening.

<doc id="949769" wikidata="Q1423755" url="?curid=949769" title="Repechage">
<text>Repechage ( , ; , ) is a practice in series competitions that allows participants who failed to meet qualifying standards by a small margin to continue to the next round. A well-known example is the wild card system.

== Types ==

Different types of repechage can occur. As a basis for the examples below, assume that 64 competitors are divided into four pools of 16 competitors, labeled A, B, C, and D. The first three rounds of the primary championship bracket winnow the field down to eight competitors for the quarter-final.

=== Full repechage ===
In full repechage, a competitor who loses to the pool winner falls into the repechage bracket. The theory is that a worthy competitor who is paired with another worthy competitor should not be unduly penalized by luck of the draw, but have an opportunity to fight for at least third place. In our example, four competitors from each pool (the loser to the pool winner in the first, second, third and quarter-final rounds) fall into the repechage bracket. A larger pool results in a longer wait for first-round losers to determine if they will compete in repechage.

=== Quarter-final repechage ===
Quarter-final repechage pulls losers from the quarter-final round only. The prior rounds are single-elimination. Losers in the quarter-final from two pools (e.g., A and B) are entered into one bracket of the repechage first round. Quarter-final losers from the other two pools are entered into the other bracket. Repechage losers are placed in seventh place. Winners of these matches play against semi-final losers of opposite bracket. Losers are placed in fifth place and winners are awarded with bronze medal each. The Australian Football League (AFL) has a similar mechanism in the AFL final eight system, whereby the top four teams at the end of the home-and-away season are given a second chance in a qualifying final, with the losers of each qualifying final given a second chance in a semi-final, while winners get a bye and compete in a preliminary final. Unlike in other sport variations, the loser from a qualifying final may win the premiership should they win all three finals, including the grand final.

=== Double-elimination repechage ===
In double-elimination repechage, any loser in the championship bracket falls into the repechage bracket. Typically the losers from the championship bracket&#x27;s first round compete against each other in the repechage first round for the right to compete in the repechage second round (against the championship bracket second round losers). In &quot;full&quot; double-elimination repechage, the eventual repechage bracket winner competes against the championship bracket winner to determine the winner of the overall competition, but the repechage bracket winner must win two matches to win the competition whereas the championship bracket winner needs only win one match. In a &quot;partial&quot; double-elimination repechage bracket, the bracket winner (or winners in dual third-place scenario) will take third place.

=== Repechage bracket with two third-place finishers ===
Dual third-place finishers can result with full, quarter-final, or double-elimination repechage. Losers from two championship bracket pools (e.g., A and B) are placed into one repechage bracket and losers from the other two pools are placed in the other repechage bracket. The winner from each pool&#x27;s repechage bracket competes against the loser in the championship semi-final who comes from one of that repechage bracket&#x27;s two pools. Alternatively, in a &quot;cross-over&quot; arrangement, the semi-final loser comes from the other bracket&#x27;s pools. Each winner of this repechage round takes third place. The losers of the prior two repechage rounds are often considered to take fifth and seventh places.

=== Consolation bracket ===
A consolation bracket is when losers fall from the primary championship bracket and compete for third place or a lesser consolation prize. Hence, except in the case of full double-elimination repechage, a repechage bracket might be referred to as a consolation bracket.

== Usage ==

=== Baseball and softball ===
In Major League Baseball (MLB) a repechage bracket is formed by wild card teams in each league.
At many levels of amateur play in baseball and softball, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), tournaments are established as a full double-elimination repechage.

In the current 64-team baseball and softball NCAA tournament formats, there are alternating four-team double-elimination repechage formats, and best two-of-three games series. The first and third rounds are full double-elimination repechages, while the second and fourth rounds are best-two-of-three-game series.

The Southeastern Conference (SEC) baseball tournament has a flip-bracket format; the winner of the first championship bracket plays the winner of the second repechage bracket, and the winner of the second championship bracket plays the winner of the first repechage bracket. Both of those games are single elimination, with the winners playing for the championship.

=== Beach volleyball ===
Some competitions use a modified double elimination format called Olympic Crossing, in which the winning teams compete until two teams remain, while teams with one loss continue in an elimination format until two of them remain. Then, in the semifinals, each of the two remaining winning teams play a team from the losers bracket, and the winners of these matches compete in the final match, while the semifinal losers compete for third place.

=== Cycling ===
In track cycling, repechage heats are used in the keirin and match sprints. These heats give a second chance for non-qualifiers in the preliminary heat(s) to advance to the next round of competition.

=== Fencing ===
Although not normally used for FIE events, sometime local events use direct elimination with repechage. A disadvantage is that some competitors have to wait. An advantage for team events is more willingness to use direct elimination (DE) from the start (with seeding by drawing lots) instead of pools. Example format sheets are here.

Repechage was formerly widely used in fencing tournaments, but the majority have now abandoned it, an exception being United States Fencing Association Division I tournaments.

=== Martial arts ===
In karate, judo, taekwondo, and wrestling tournaments, single-elimination brackets are used to determine the two athletes who will compete in the final for first and second place. The repechage bracket is built from athletes who were knocked out by the finalists and building brackets to determine third place.

Repechage addresses the possibility of two top competitors meeting in an early round, allowing the loser a chance to compete for a bronze medal.

===Quiz===
In &quot;University Challenge&quot;, 28 teams compete in each season. Of the fourteen teams who lose in the first round, the four teams with the highest scores compete in the Highest Scoring Losers Play-Offs, with the two winners advancing to the second round.

===Rowing===
In rowing, often only the first one or two boats in a race will qualify automatically for the next round, and the other boats race again in one or more repechage to qualify. Conditions such as wind vary between the heats, often significantly affecting a competitor&#x27;s time, and the repechage system allows the &quot;fastest losers&quot; to qualify irrespective of the variable conditions in the opening heats.

===Rugby ===
In rugby, the qualification processes for the Rugby Union World Cup and the Rugby League World Cup use a repechage system. The Air New Zealand Cup, New Zealand&#x27;s domestic professional competition in Union, used the repechage in the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, but scrapped it for the 2007 Air New Zealand Cup.

=== Sailing ===
A repechage stage in sailing is sometimes used in match-racing competition to allow teams finishing the round robin(s) just below the top-level teams a chance to advance to the quarter-final stage. This is standard competition for the Olympic-class events, such as the ISAF Sailing World Cup.

=== Track and field athletics ===
In field athletics, automatic qualification for the next round depends on meeting or surpassing a specified minimum result. The remaining qualification spots (if any) are given in order to the best results.

In track athletics, automatic qualification for the next round is given to the best competitors in each heat. Other competitors with the best times may qualify for the next round indirectly as &quot;fastest losers&quot; as a result of the repechage. If a particular heat was significantly faster than the others, repechage spots can all be taken by athletes from that heat.

== Alternatives ==
Alternatives to repechage include single-elimination, round-robin, wild card and the Swiss system.

<doc id="949770" wikidata="Q5071466" url="?curid=949770" title="Chandraswami">
<text>Tantrik Jagadacharya Chandraswami (born Nemichand Jain; 08 February 1935 – 23 May 2017) was an Indian Tantrik.

His father Dharamchand Gandhi Jain came from Behror in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The family moved to Hyderabad in 1960s when he was a child. Chandraswami was attracted to the study of Tantra from an early age. He left home when still young to become a student of Upadhyay Amar Muni and the scholar of Tantra, Mahamohopadhyay Gopinath Kaviraj. He later lived in the jungles of Bihar and Kathmandu where he spent time in meditation. He claimed that after four years he obtained extraordinary powers called siddhis.

Though Chandraswami was by birth a Jain, he became a &quot;sadhaka&quot; (worshipper) of the Goddess Kali. He was also interested in interfaith dialogue, and sat on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute.

==Rise to fame== 
He first gained fame through his skill as an astrologer but his rise to national prominence came as a result of his association with three Prime Ministers of India P. V. Narasimha Rao, Chandra Shekhar and V. P. Singh. Chandraswami was said to have been their spiritual adviser. Soon after P. V. Narasimha Rao became Prime Minister in 1991, Chandraswami built an ashram known as Vishwa Dharmayatan Sansathan in Delhi&#x27;s Qutub Institutional Area. The land for the ashram had been allotted by Indira Gandhi.
Chandraswami is said to have dispensed spiritual advice to the Sultan of Brunei, Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa of Bahrain, Hosni Mubarak, Yasser Arafat, Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, actress Elizabeth Taylor, arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi businessmen Tiny Rowland and Mohamed Al-Fayed and crime lord Dawood Ibrahim. His loyal supporters include his secretary former BJP MLA Vikram Singh, Assistant Vijayraj Chauhan, the late Kailash Nath Aggarwal known as Mamaji. Chandraswami&#x27;s finances have fluctuated with his political fortune.

==Legal challenges==
Chandraswami has been accused repeatedly of financial irregularity activities. In 1996 he was arrested on charges of defrauding a London-based businessman of $100,000. He has faced charges for repeated violation of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. An income-tax raid on his ashram is reported to have uncovered original drafts of payments to Adnan Khashoggi of $11 million. In its report, the Jain Commission dedicated a volume to his alleged involvement in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Seventeen years after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, the Enforcement Directorate was still investigating his alleged role as financier of the killing. 
In May 2009, the Supreme Court granted Chandraswami permission to travel abroad, lifting a ban on overseas travel imposed as a result of his alleged involvement in the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. In June 2011, the Supreme Court fined Chandraswami, for violating the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, a sum of ₹9 crores.

==Death==
Chandraswami died of multiple organ failure at Apollo Hospital in New Delhi on 23 May 2017. Some of his followers believe that he was given slow poison while admitted into the hospital.

<text>The Shoes of the Fisherman is a 1968 American epic political drama film directed by Michael Anderson, based on Morris West’s 1963 novel about Vatican and Cold War politics. The film stars Anthony Quinn, Oskar Werner, David Janssen, Vittorio De Sica, Leo McKern, John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier.

The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on November 14, 1968. It received mixed reviews, but received Oscar nominations for Best Original Score and Best Production Design. Composer Alex North won a Golden Globe for his score, and the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture Drama.

== Plot ==
During the height of the Cold War, Kiril Pavlovich Lakota, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Lviv, Ukraine, is unexpectedly set free after 20 years in a Siberian labour camp by his former gaoler Piotr Ilyich Kamenev, now the Premier of the Soviet Union.

He is sent to Rome, where the pope makes him a cardinal, assigned titulus of the Church of St. Athanasius. Lakota is reluctant, begging to be given &quot;a simple mission with simple men&quot;, but the pope insists that he kneel and receive the scarlet &quot;zucchetto&quot; that designates the rank of cardinal.

When the pontiff suddenly collapses and dies, the process of a papal conclave begins, and Cardinal Lakota participates as one of the electors. During the &quot;sede vacante&quot;, two cardinals in particular, Cardinal Leone and Cardinal Rinaldi, are shown to be the leading &quot;papabili&quot; (candidates). After seven deadlocked ballots, Lakota is unexpectedly elected Pope as a compromise candidate (suggested by Cardinal Rinaldi) by spontaneous acclamation in the Sistine Chapel by the College of Cardinals, many of whom have spoken with him and been impressed by his ideas and his humility. Lakota reluctantly accepts election and takes the name of Pope Kiril. Meanwhile, the world is on the brink of nuclear war due to a Chinese–Soviet feud made worse by a famine caused by wide spread crop failures in China.

The evening after his election, Pope Kiril, with the help of his valet Gelasio, sneaks out of the Vatican and explores the city of Rome dressed as a simple priest. By chance, he encounters Dr. Ruth Faber, who is in a troubled marriage with Rome-based television journalist George Faber. Kiril helps get her medicine from a pharmacist to help a dying Jewish patient of hers. He says a Catholic prayer over the dying man, upon which the man&#x27;s friends say he is Jewish; Kiril then says a Jewish prayer, along with the man&#x27;s friends, and says he learned it from a rabbi in the labor camp.

A major secondary plot in the film is the Pope&#x27;s relationship with controversial theologian, philosopher and scientist Father Telemond (who resembles real-life priest Teilhard de Chardin). The Pope becomes Telemond&#x27;s close personal friend, but to his deep regret, in his official capacity, he must allow the Holy Office to censure Telemond for his heterodox views. Nevertheless, the two remain friends and Telemond becomes the Pope&#x27;s most trusted advisor. To the Pope&#x27;s deep grief, Father Telemond dies from a neurological malady, shortly after giving the former some much needed support.

Later, the Pope returns to the Soviet Union, dressed in civilian clothing, to meet privately with Kamenev and Chinese Chairman Peng to discuss the ongoing crisis. Pope Kiril realises that if the troubles in China continue, the cost could be a war that could rip the world apart. At his papal coronation, Kiril removes his papal tiara and pledges to sell the church&#x27;s property to help the Chinese, much to the delight of the crowds in St. Peter&#x27;s Square below. This revolutionary action brings the world a new chance at peace and Kiril&#x27;s decision is internationally acclaimed.

== Cast ==
==Production==

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer purchased the film rights in 1964 and the production was assigned to George Englund who was to write the screenplay with Morris West. (Englund was also making &quot;Dark of the Sun&quot; for the studio.)

Anthony Quinn was announced as the star of the film relatively early. The original director was to be British director Anthony Asquith, but he became ill in November 1967 (and eventually died a few months later) and was replaced by Michael Anderson.

Englund asked for technical advice from the Vatican but received no permission to film there, so places like the Sistine Chapel had to be recreated.

The papal tiara used for the coronation scene in the film is modeled after Pope Paul VI&#x27;s papal tiara.

The ending of the film was changed from the book. Morris West said:
Structurally speaking I&#x27;ve always thought &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; was one of my weaker books. It wanders too much. The script for the film is tighter, more direct and I think it says in a stronger way part of what I wanted to say in the novel. We&#x27;ve come to a point in history where men – black or white, Marxist or capitalist, Christian or non Christian – are going to have to make a choice. They&#x27;re either going to have to commit themselves to an act of love for each other or an act of hate for each other. Men on each side have to say: &quot;Look we&#x27;re all brothers. Why do we kill each other in the streets? Don&#x27;t let&#x27;s drop the atomic bomb. Let&#x27;s talk for one hour more.&quot; Today this is the real triumph of good over evil. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried to put into the last speech for the film.
Morris West said he spent months working on a scene where Telemond was questioned by the Inquisition. He says eventually the scene worked &quot;but only because I raised hell after finding that it had been altered by the actors with the consent of the director. I argued that it destroyed the theological validity of the plot in violation of contractual obligations between the studio and me.&quot; West says that &quot;By the end of the film the accumulation of the variations was such that I took my name off the script.&quot; This made him reluctant to sell &quot;anything other than a thriller or a very simple story to the movies again&quot; because of the way Hollywood &quot;tends to distort the underlying philosophy and theology of anything that can&#x27;t easily be shaped for the screen.&quot;

==Reception==
The film was the sixth most popular movie at the Australian box office in 1969. It was still a notable box-office disappointment. The escalating production costs of this film, along with &quot;Ice Station Zebra &quot; at the same time, led to the transfer of MGM President Robert O&#x27;Brien to chairman of the board, but he resigned this position in early 1969 after both films were released and failed to recoup their costs.

Alex North was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Score and George Davis and Edward Carfagno were nominated for Best Art Direction.

&quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; holds a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews.

<doc id="949791" wikidata="Q7369426" url="?curid=949791" title="Ross Island Bridge">
<text>The Ross Island Bridge is a cantilever truss bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. It carries U.S. Route 26 (Mount Hood Highway) across the river between southwest and southeast Portland. The bridge opened in 1926 and was designed by Gustav Lindenthal and honors Oregon pioneer Sherry Ross. It is named for its proximity to Ross Island. Although it looks like a deck arch bridge, it is a cantilever deck truss bridge, a rare type in Oregon.

==History and description==
The bridge was part of the unprecedented period of bridge building in Portland during the 1920s. It was opened on December 21, 1926, and cost $2 million to construct. The bridge was designed by a famous engineer named Gustav Lindenthal.

The bridge is named for its location close to Ross Island, an island in the Willamette River which measures about one-and-a-half by one mile. The bridge is about north of the island and does not connect with, nor does it provide access to, Ross Island. There is a pedestrian walkway on the north side of the bridge, with no barrier between the sidewalk and the westbound right lane. The bridge originally had sidewalks on both sides, but the one on the south side was removed in 1958, to provide more space for vehicles.

A pedestrian underpass was built at SW Kelly Avenue and SW Naito Parkway in 1942 by the state of Oregon in conjunction with the Ross Island Bridge project.
The bridge&#x27;s girders were originally painted black, but in 1955–56 they were repainted green. In 1961, Portland architect Lewis Crutcher suggested repainting all of Portland&#x27;s downtown-area bridges from black into different colors, and the proposal also included changing the Ross Island Bridge&#x27;s color to blue. The proposal was approved by the Multnomah County Commission, and repainting of the Ross Island Bridge was carried out in the summer of 1965. The bridge&#x27;s color remains blue today, specifically &quot;phthalo blue&quot;.

During the Great Depression, the bank of the Willamette near the Ross Island Bridge became the site of a Hooverville.

In 1976, ownership was transferred from Multnomah County to the Oregon Department of Transportation. In 2000–2001 the bridge underwent a $12.5 million renovation in which the deck was replaced, the railings were replaced and upgraded, and the drainage system and lighting were improved. During this renovation, lead paint was discovered, causing some delays and cost overruns.

In 2014, work began on a full repainting of the bridge, including removal of the old, lead-based paint and restoration of the bridge&#x27;s blue color, which had faded since being applied, in 1965. The project was completed in early 2019.

==Approaches==
===West approach===
The west end of the bridge has a full interchange with Naito Parkway (Oregon Route 10, Pacific Highway West), as well as access to and from Arthur Street, which carries US 26 towards Interstate 405. (Until around 2005, US 26 went north on Naito Parkway and through the south side of downtown Portland.) Access is also provided to and from the north end of Oregon Route 43 (Macadam Avenue - Oswego Highway), which runs next to Interstate 5 as frontage roads, and allows for access to and from I-5 via slip ramps and U-turns.

The pedestrian walkway comes off the north side parallel to the ramp to Kelly Avenue (leading to Arthur Street), running to the intersection of Kelly Avenue and Porter Street.

===East approach===

At the east end of the bridge, US 26 becomes Powell Boulevard as it passes over Oregon Route 99E (Pacific Highway East). Route 99E is a high-speed arterial road, built to near-freeway standards; just to the north it passes over a railroad on the twin Martin Luther King, Jr. Viaduct and Grand Avenue Viaduct. There is a direct ramp from US 26 east to Route 99E south, but no northbound access. Likewise, there is access from Route 99E north to the bridge (via Woodward Street and 8th Avenue), but traffic from Route 99E south must exit at Mill Street, about to the north, and head down Division Street, 11th Avenue and Milwaukie Avenue to US 26. This same movement is done to reach US 26 east; US 26 west however has direct access to Route 99E north via 9th Avenue and Woodward Street. A fourth direct ramp runs from Route 99E north to US 26 east.

The pedestrian walkway simply becomes the north sidewalk of Powell Boulevard, a major street.

<text>Zsigmondy is a lunar impact crater located beyond the northwestern limb on the far side of the Moon. Attached to the southeastern rim of the crater is the crater Omar Khayyam, which lies within the much larger Poczobutt. Farther to the east, along the north rim of Poczobutt, is Smoluchowski.

The rim of Zsigmondy is eroded and distorted in form, having a somewhat polygonal outline. It overlies a comparably sized crater formation Zsigmondy S along the western rim. A pair of small craters lies across the low western rim, and another pair is situated on the inner wall to the southeast. On the interior, the floor is relatively flat in the western half with a low central rise near the midpoint.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zsigmondy.

<doc id="949822" wikidata="Q490072" url="?curid=949822" title="Roger Livesey">
<text>Roger Livesey (25 June 1906 – 4 February 1976) was a British stage and film actor. He is most often remembered for the three Powell &amp; Pressburger films in which he starred: &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot;, &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;. Tall and broad with a mop of chestnut hair, Livesey used his highly distinctive husky voice, gentle manner and athletic physique to create many notable roles in his theatre and film work.

==Early life==
Livesey was born in Barry, Wales. Although most articles about him indicated that his parents were Samuel and Mary Catherine ( Edwards) Livesey, later research has shown that his father was actually Joseph Livesey. The confusion may have arisen because his mother Mary married Samuel (Joseph&#x27;s brother) after Joseph&#x27;s death and the death of Samuel&#x27;s wife, Mary&#x27;s sister.

Samuel and Mary had a child of their own, Stella, who was both Roger&#x27;s half sister (through their mother) and first cousin (through their fathers). Roger Livesey was educated at Westminster City School, London. His two half-brothers (who were also his first cousins) were also actors.

==Acting career==

Livesey studied under Italia Conti. His first stage role was as the office boy in &quot;Loyalty&quot; at St James&#x27;s Theatre in 1917. He then appeared in a wide range of productions from Shakespeare to modern comedies. He played various roles in the West End from 1920 to 1926, toured the West Indies and South Africa, and then returned to join the Old Vic/Sadler&#x27;s Wells company from September 1932 until May 1934. In 1936 he appeared in New York City in Wycherley&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Country Wife&quot;. While in New York he married actress Ursula Jeans, whom he had known previously in England (Livesey&#x27;s sister Maggie was already married to Ursula Jeans&#x27; brother Desmond).

At the outbreak of the Second World War Livesey and Jeans were among the first volunteers to entertain the troops. He then applied for flying duties in the Royal Air Force but due to his age was rejected. Instead he worked in an aircraft factory at Desford aerodrome near Leicester to &quot;do his bit for the war effort&quot;.

Livesey was chosen by Michael Powell to play the lead in &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943) after Powell was denied his original choice, Laurence Olivier (Winston Churchill had objected to the film and the Fleet Air Arm refused to release Olivier, who had been a Hollywood film star before returning to England to take a Navy commission). The film was shown in New York and established Livesey&#x27;s international reputation as a talented character actor. In 1945, he was the first choice for the male lead role in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, which in the end went to Trevor Howard.

He toured Australia from 1956 to 1958 playing Jimmy Broadbent in &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; and continued playing many theatrical roles during his film career until 1969. One of his last roles was as the Duke of St Bungay in &quot;The Pallisers&quot; television series. His final television appearance was in the series &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot; in 1975.

==Death==

Livesey died in Watford from colorectal cancer at the age of 69 on 4 February 1976. He shares a memorial plaque with his wife Ursula Jeans in the actors&#x27; church St Paul&#x27;s in Covent Garden.

==Livesey family==

The Livesey family has a complicated structure. Brothers Joseph and Sam Livesey married the Edwards sisters. Sam married Margaret Ann in 1900 and Joseph married Mary Catherine in 1905. Sam and Margaret Ann had two sons, Jack (1901) and Barrie Livesey (1905). Joseph and Mary Catherine had two children, Roger (1906) and Maggie (1911).

After Joseph died in 1911 and Margaret Ann died in 1913, Sam married Mary Catherine in 1913. They then brought up the children as one large family, having another child of their own, Stella in 1915.

The family tree was further complicated when Roger Livesey married the actress Ursula Jeans, whose brother, Desmond Jeans, was already married to Roger&#x27;s sister, Maggie.

Many of the family formed a touring company of actors, performing in regional theatres and from the back of an old wagon, one side of which could be dropped to form a stage. Because of their touring, they did not regard themselves as particularly Welsh, or English. They were just British because people happened to be born in the places where their mothers happened to be residing at the time.

<text>Richard Douglas Lamm (August 3, 1935 – July 29, 2021) was an American politician, writer, and attorney. He served three terms as the 38th Governor of Colorado as a Democrat (1975–1987) and ran for the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States in 1996.
Lamm was a Certified Public Accountant and was the co-director of the Institute for Public Policy Studies at the University of Denver.

==Early life and education==
Richard Douglas Lamm was born on August 3, 1935, in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Mary Louise (Townsend) and Edward Arnold Lamm, a coal company executive. He graduated from Mt Lebanon Sr. High School near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he majored in accounting. Lamm spent his college summers working as a lumberjack in Oregon, a stockboy in New York, and helping out on an ore boat. Lamm graduated from college in 1957, then served one year of active duty as a first lieutenant in the United States Army at Fort Carson in Colorado and Fort Eustis in Virginia until switching to reserve duty in 1958.

From 1958 to 1960 Lamm lived in Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Berkeley, holding jobs as an accountant, tax clerk, and a law clerk.

Lamm attended law school at the University of California, graduated in 1961, then moved to Denver in 1962, where he worked as an accountant and then set up a law practice. Lamm took to the Colorado lifestyle, becoming an avid skier, mountain climber, hiker, and member of the Colorado Mountain Club. He joined the faculty of the University of Denver in 1969 and was associated with the University for the rest of his life.

In 1963 he married Dottie Vennard, a former airline flight attendant. In 1998 she won the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate from Colorado, but lost in the general election to incumbent Republican Ben Nighthorse Campbell.

Lamm was selected as one of &quot;Time&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;200 Young Leaders of America&quot; in 1974, and won the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; &quot;Peace 2020&quot; essay in 1985. In 1992, he was honored by the &quot;Denver Post&quot; and Historic Denver, Inc. as one of the &quot;Colorado 100&quot; - people who made significant contributions to Colorado and made lasting impressions on the state&#x27;s history. Lamm was the recipient of the 1993 Humanist of the Year award from the American Humanist Association. He was Chairman of the Pew Health Professions Commission and a public member of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

==Political activities==

===Colorado House of Representatives===
In 1964 he was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives as a Democrat from Denver. In 1967, he drafted and succeeded in passing the nation&#x27;s first liberalized abortion law. He was an early leader of the environmental movement, and was President of the First National Conference on Population and the Environment.

In 1972, as a member of the Colorado General Assembly, Lamm led the movement against Denver&#x27;s hosting of the 1976 Winter Olympics, as part of a group known as Citizens for Colorado&#x27;s Future (CCF). Denver had already been awarded the games, but the movement succeeded in cutting off public funding for the games, forcing the city to cancel its hosting. Innsbruck, Austria then replaced Denver as the host. Lamm&#x27;s successful effort made him known statewide.

===Colorado governor===

Lamm ran for Governor of Colorado in 1974 on a platform to limit growth, and was elected. Reacting to the high cost of campaigning, he had walked the state in his campaign.

As candidate and then governor, Lamm promised for environmental reasons to &quot;drive a silver stake&quot; through plans to build Interstate 470, a proposed circumferential highway around the southwest part of the Denver Metropolitan Area. However, continued development in the area led to increased congestion on surface streets, and the highway was later built, largely with state funds, as State Highway 470.

In 1984, his outspoken statements in support of physician-assisted suicide generated controversy, specifically over his use of the phrase &quot;we have a duty to die.&quot; Lamm later explained that he &quot;was essentially raising a general statement about the human condition, not beating up on the elderly,&quot; and that the exact phrasing in the speech was &quot;We&#x27;ve got a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts and everything else like that and let the other society, our kids, build a reasonable life.&quot; His dire predictions for the future of social security and health care (&quot;duty to die&quot;) earned him the nickname &quot;Governor Gloom&quot;. His views were satirized by noted folk singer Tom Paxton in January 1985.

Lamm was elected Colorado governor three times. When he left office in 1987 after three terms and twelve years in the office, he was the longest-serving governor in state history (his successor, Roy Romer, matched this record).

===Later political campaigns===

In 1985, he announced he would not seek a fourth term as Governor or a Senate seat.

In 1990, Colorado Democratic state party leaders tried to get Lamm to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. William L. Armstrong, a Republican, but Lamm declined. In 1992 he ran for the U.S. Senate but suffered his first political defeat. Ben Nighthorse Campbell beat him in the Democratic primary and went on to win the seat. Campbell later switched to the Republican Party.

In 1996 Lamm, while noting that he was still a registered Democrat, criticized both his own Democratic Party and the Republican Party, saying &quot;I think both political parties are controlled by special interest money, and I&#x27;ve had enough of it.&quot; and &quot;The Democrats are too close to the trial lawyers and the National Education Association. The Republicans are too close to the radical right.&quot; On July 9, 1996, he formally announced his intention to run for the nomination of the Reform Party for the U.S. presidency. Less than 48 hours after Lamm announced his candidacy, Ross Perot, who built the Reform Party from his United We Stand America organization, said he would run as the Reform Party nominee if drafted. In early August, Lamm picked former California Republican congressman Ed Zschau, a high-tech millionaire and proven fund-raiser, to be his running mate on his would-be presidential ticket. Ultimately, however, Perot won 65.2 percent of the 49,266 votes cast by party members nationwide, Lamm winning just 34.8 percent.

==Writer and novelist==
In 1985, while still in the governor&#x27;s office, Lamm tried his hand as a novelist. The resulting novel, &quot;1988&quot;, is a story about a former Democratic governor of Texas running for U.S. President on a populist, third-party ticket, declaring himself a &quot;progressive conservative.&quot; The main character bore a number of similarities to Lamm himself, in his stated political positions, his background as a Democratic governor, as well as presaging Lamm&#x27;s own unsuccessful run for the Reform Party nomination in 1996. However, the main character in &quot;1988&quot; was also portrayed as a pawn of an international conspiracy to capture the White House.

A voluminous writer, Lamm&#x27;s other works include &quot;Population and the Law&quot; (1972), &quot;Some Reflections on the Balkanization of America&quot; (1978), &quot;Megatraumas: America at the Year 2000&quot; (1980), &quot;Energy Activities in the West&quot; (1980), &quot;The Angry West: A Vulnerable Land and Its Future&quot; (1982), &quot;Campaign for Quality: An Education Agenda for the 80&#x27;s&quot; (1983), &quot;Pioneers and Politicians: Ten Colorado Governors in Profile&quot; (1984), &quot;Copernican Politics&quot; (1984), &quot;The American West: A poem&quot; (1985), &quot;Immigration Time Bomb: The Fragmenting of America&quot; (1985), &quot;The Lamm Administration: A Retrospective&quot; (1986), &quot;California Conspiracy&quot; (1988), &quot;Hard Choices&quot; (1989), &quot;Crisis: The Uncompetitive Society&quot; (1989), &quot;The fall and Rise of the American Economy&quot; (1989), &quot;Indicators of Decline: An article from The Futurist&quot; (1993), &quot;The Supply Factor in Health Care Cost Containment&quot; (1993), &quot;The Ethics of Excess: An article from The Hastings Center Report&quot; (1994), &quot;Health Care Workforce Reform.: An article from State Legislatures&quot; (1994), &quot;The West at Risk&quot; (1994), &quot;Futurizing America&#x27;s Institutions.: An article from The Futurist&quot; (1996), &quot;The price of Modern Medicine&quot; (1997), &quot;Mountains of Colorado&quot; (1999), &quot;Government does, indeed, ration health care: An article from State Legislatures&quot; (1999), &quot;Redrawing the Ethics Map.: An article from The Hastings Center Report&quot; (1999), &quot;Vision for a Compassionate and Affordable Health System&quot; (2001), &quot;Brave New World of Health Care&quot; (2003), &quot;The Brave New World of Health Care&quot; (2004), &quot;The Challenge of an Aging Society: The Future of U.S. Health Care&quot; (2005), &quot;Two Wands, One Nation: An Essay on Race and Community in America&quot; (2006), &quot;Condition Critical: A New Moral Vision of Health Care&quot; (2007), and &quot;The Brave New World of Health Care Revisited&quot; (2013) with Andy Sharma, PhD.

==Activities after political office==

After leaving office, Lamm continued to speak publicly on environmental issues, mainly population control, immigration reduction, and health care issues.

In 2004 Lamm unsuccessfully ran for a seat on the board of directors of the Sierra Club. He urged that the Sierra Club advocate immigration controls as a way to limit environmental degradation due to population growth.

Lamm served as the Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), and on the board of directors of the Diversity Alliance for a Sustainable America (DASA). He was the Co-Director of the Institute for Public Policy Studies at the University of Denver.
He authored a book, &quot;The Brave New World of Health Care&quot;, a criticism of current United States health care policies and proposals for reforming them. (Fulcrum Publishing, ) Lamm also served on the board of directors of American Water Development Inc, along with, among others, Maurice Strong, Samuel Belzberg, Alexander Crutchfield, and William Ruckelshaus.

In 2005, a 2004 speech by Lamm titled &quot;I Have a Plan to Destroy America,&quot; became famous after being frequently forwarded as an email; in the talk he criticized multiculturalism.

In 2006, he gave a controversial speech on the theme of his recently released book, &quot;Two Wands, One Nation&quot;, arguing that black and Hispanic Americans should embrace &quot;Japanese or Jewish values&quot;. The essay was widely criticized by Colorado community groups and leaders of his own party.

==Death==
Lamm died on July 29, 2021, in Denver from complications of a pulmonary embolism, one week before his 86th birthday.

<doc id="949830" wikidata="Q1304121" url="?curid=949830" title="Kremlin Armoury">
<text>The Kremlin Armoury () is one of the oldest museums in Moscow. It is located in the Moscow Kremlin, and is a part of the Moscow Kremlin Museum.
The Kremlin Armoury originated as the royal arsenal in 1508. Until the transfer of the court to St Petersburg, the Armoury was in charge of producing, purchasing and storing weapons, jewelry and various household articles of the tsars. The finest Muscovite gunsmiths (the Vyatkin brothers), jewelers (Gavrila Ovdokimov), and painters (Simon Ushakov) used to work there. In 1640 and 1683, they opened the iconography and pictorial studios, where the lessons on painting and handicrafts could be given. In 1700, the Armoury was enriched with the treasures of the Golden and Silver chambers of the Russian tsars.

==History==
In 1711, Peter the Great had the majority of masters transferred to his new capital, St Petersburg. 15 years later, the Armoury was merged with the Fiscal Yard (the oldest depository of the royal treasures), Stables Treasury (in charge of storing harnesses and carriages) and the Master Chamber (in charge of sewing clothes and bedclothes for the tsars). After that, the Armoury was renamed into the Arms and Master Chamber. Alexander I of Russia nominated the Armoury as the first public museum in Moscow in 1806, but the collections were not opened to the public until seven years later.

Ten of the 44 surviving Fabergé imperial Easter eggs are displayed at the Armory Museum. After the Russian Revolution, the imperial family&#x27;s palaces were ransacked and their treasures moved to the Kremlin Armoury on order of Vladimir Lenin.

==Russian Diamond Fund==
Beside the Armoury Chamber/Museum, the Kremlin Armoury is also currently home to the Russian Diamond Fund.

<doc id="949841" wikidata="Q59698" url="?curid=949841" title="Swakopmund">
<text>Swakopmund (&quot;Mouth of the Swakop&quot;) is a city on the coast of western Namibia, west of the Namibian capital Windhoek via the B2 main road. It is the capital of the Erongo administrative district. It has 75,921 inhabitants.

The city is situated at the edge of the Namib Desert and is the fourth largest population centre in Namibia. Swakopmund is a popular beach resort and characterized by 19th century German colonial architecture. The city was founded in 1892 as the main harbour for German South West Africa.

Buildings in the city include the Altes Gefängnis, a prison designed by Heinrich Bause in 1909. The Woermannhaus, built in 1906 with a prominent tower (Damara tower), is now a public library. Attractions in Swakopmund include the Swakopmund Museum, the National Marine Aquarium of Namibia, the Crystal Gallery. 

Activities like quad biking, camel rides, sky diving, paragliding, and desert day trips are offered in the sand dunes near Langstrand, south of the Swakop River.

Outside the city, the Rossmund Desert Golf Course is one of only five all-grass desert golf courses in the world. Nearby is a farm that offers camel rides to tourists and the Martin Luther steam locomotive, dating from 1896 and abandoned in the desert.

==History==
===Etymology===
The town is named after the Swakop River. The German settlers rendered it &quot;Swachaub&quot;, and when in 1896 the district was officially proclaimed, the version &quot;Swakopmund&quot; (German: &quot;Mouth of the Swakop&quot;) was introduced.

The Herero called the place &quot;Otjozondjii&quot;, which means &#x27;place of seashells&#x27;.

===Until World War I===

Captain Curt von François founded Swakopmund in 1892 as the main harbour for the Imperial German colony—the natural deep-sea harbour at Walvis Bay belonged to the British. The founding date was on 8 August when the crew of gunboat erected two beacons on the shore. Swakopmund was chosen for the availability of fresh water and a relatively easy connection into the centre of the South West African territory, particularly Otjimbingwe and Windhoek. Other sites such as Sandwich Harbour and Cape Cross were found unsuitable due to dune belts that block the way to the hinterland.

The Swakop site did not offer any natural protection to ships lying off the coast, a geographical feature sparsely located along Namibia&#x27;s coast. When the first 120 &quot;Schutztruppe&quot; soldiers and 40 settlers were offloaded at Swakopmund in 1893, they had to dig caves into the sand for shelter. The offloading was done by Kru tribesmen from Liberia who used special boats. Woermann-Linie, the operator of the shipping route to Germany, employed 600 Kru at that time.

Swakopmund quickly became the main port for imports and exports for the whole territory and was one of six towns which received municipal status in 1909. Many governmental departments for German South West Africa had offices in Swakopmund. During the Herero Wars, a concentration camp for Herero people was operated in town. Inmates were forced into slave labour, resulting in the death of approximately 2,000 Herero.


Soon, the harbour created by the &quot;Mole&quot; (breakwater) silted up, and in 1905, work was started on a wooden jetty, but in the long term this was inadequate. In 1914, construction of a steel jetty was therefore commenced. Trading and shipping companies founded branches in Swakopmund.

===Until Namibian Independence===
Early in World War I in 1915, German South West Africa was taken over by the Union of South Africa. With this, the logistic and political barriers disappeared to use the harbour in Walvis Bay for South West Africa, as the territory now became known. In Swakopmund all harbour activities ceased, central government services disappeared, and the jetty became a pedestrian walkway. Businesses closed down, the number of inhabitants diminished, and the town fell into decline.

However, Swakopmund had been guaranteed a lifeline in a 1923 treaty in London negotiating the aftermath of World War I. Its moderate climate and location on the Atlantic made it suitable as a holiday resort for the white population of the territory, and the town was re-shaped into a tourism destination. Having lost its military importance, Swakopmund was used for recreation even during World War II, and in the 1940s and 1950s it was expanded to serve more and more tourists.

With the opening of the Rössing uranium mine in 1976, Swakopmund changed its shape once again. While this mine to the east eventually got its own town built, Arandis, logistics and workers&#x27; accommodation were first supplied by Swakopmund.

===Since 1990===
After Namibian independence from South Africa in 1990 many street names were changed from their original German, or in some cases, Afrikaans names, to honour Namibians, predominantly Namibians of black heritage. For example, in 2001, then-president of Namibia Sam Nujoma renamed the main street (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Straße) Sam Nujoma Avenue in honour of himself.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Swakopmund lies on the B2 road, and on the Trans-Namib Railway from Windhoek to Walvis Bay. It is served by Swakopmund Airport and Swakopmund Railway Station.

Public health facilities in Swakopmund are the Swakopmund State Hospital and the Tamariskia Clinic. The main private healthcare provider in the city is the Cottage Medi-Clinic, a hospital with 70 beds.

The Swakopmund Correctional Facility is one of Namibia&#x27;s seven major prisons.

===Mining===
The discovery of uranium at Rössing outside town led to the development of the world&#x27;s largest open-pit uranium mine and the foundation of Arandis. This had an enormous impact on all facets of life in Swakopmund which necessitated expansion of the infrastructure of the town to make it into one of the most modern in Namibia.

Salt Company Swakopmund produces approximately 120,000 tons of table salt per year through solar evaporation of sea water. The salt is marketed as &quot;Light Flow&quot;.

===Tourism===

The city has scattered coffee shops, night clubs, bars, and hotels. Recreation includes balloon rides, skydiving, quad biking, and small marine cruises. The Swakopmund Skydiving Club has operated from Swakopmund Airport since its founding in 1972.

There are three museums, the Swakopmund Museum, the Kristall Galerie () and the Martin Luther (steam locomotive) museum outside town.

As of the 1970s, German influences remained evident, including German street names, a German daily newspaper, and the German language being spoken by some residents, prompting &quot;The New York Times&quot; to describe it as &quot;more German than Germany&quot;. A 2008 &quot;New York Times&quot; article describes the town as having &quot;the dislocating feel of a Baltic Sea resort set in the tropics&quot;.

===Technology===
In October 2000, an agreement was signed between the Namibian and People&#x27;s Republic of China governments to build a satellite tracking station at Swakopmund. Construction was completed in July 2001 at a site north of Swakopmund to the east of the Henties Bay-Swakopmund road and opposite the Swakopmund Salt Works. The site was chosen as it was on the orbital track of a crewed spacecraft during its re-entry phase. Costing N$12 million, the complex covers an area of 150m by 85m. It is equipped with five metre and nine metre satellite dishes.

===Education===
The German school Regierungsschule Swakopmund was previously located in the city. The four secondary schools are Secondary School Swakopmund, Namib High School, Private School Swakopmund, and Coastal High School. West Side High School, Atlantic High School and Private School Swakopmund include both primary and secondary grades. Other Primary schools include Hanganeni Primary, Tamariskia Primary, Festus ǃGonteb Primary, Swakopmund Primary, Namib Primary and Vrede Rede Primary Schools.

==Politics==
===Administrative divisions===
There are the following districts and suburbs in Swakopmund:
*Town Centre
*Vineta
*Mile 4
*Ocean View
*Kramersdorf
*Vogelstrand
*Waterfront
*Mondesa
*Matutura
*Industrial Area
*Tamariskia
*Democratic Resettlement Community (DRC), an informal settlement founded in 2001 as temporary housing for people waiting for subsidized housing in the city.
Most inhabitants of the town live in the suburbs of Vineta, Tamariskia, Mondesa and Vogelstrand. Both black and white people, mostly well-to-do, live in Vineta. Tamariskia was originally a neighbourhood for the coloured people, built in the early 1970s, to replace the shacks the coloureds earlier had between the town centre and Vineta. Mondesa existed already in the 1960s, and it was a neighbourhood for the black people, and it was a considerable distance from the town centre in the early days.

===Local authority elections===
Swakopmund is governed by a municipal council that has ten seats.

Namibia&#x27;s ruling SWAPO party won the 2010 local authority election with 4,496 votes, followed by the local Swakopmund Residents Association (SRA, 1,005 votes), the United Democratic Front (UDF, 916 votes), the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP, 666 votes), and the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO, 280 votes). The 2015 local authority election was again won by SWAPO which gained six seats (5,534 votes). One seat each was won by the UDF (1,168 votes), the SRA (790 votes), the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 497 votes), and NUDO (296 votes).

The 2020 local authority election was won by the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020. The IPC obtained 3,458 votes and gained three seats. SWAPO was the runner-up, obtaining 2,745 votes and also gaining three seats. The SRA obtained 1,575 votes and two seats, and one seat each went to the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 1,059 votes) and the UDF with 641 votes.

==Geography==
===Climate===

Surrounded by the Namib Desert on three sides and the cold Atlantic waters to the west, Swakopmund has a desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification) with mild conditions year-round. The average temperature ranges from . Rainfall is less than per year, making gutters and drainpipes on buildings a rarity. The cold Benguela Current supplies moisture for the area in the form of fog that can reach as deep as inland. Fog that originates offshore from the collision of the cold Benguela Current and warm air from the Hadley Cell creates a fog belt that frequently envelops parts of the Namib desert. Coastal regions can experience more than 180 days of thick fog a year. While this has proved a major hazard to ships – more than one thousand wrecks litter the Skeleton Coast – it is a vital source of moisture for desert life. The fauna and flora of the area have adapted to this phenomenon and now rely upon the fog as a source of moisture. The climate is cold for its latitude, which is just northern of Southern Tropics, and summer months (Dec, Jan, Feb) are even colder than 20 degrees Celsius. This means summer in Swakopmund is colder than winter in Southern Florida (for example Miami), although Swakopmund is closer to the equator.

==Notable people==
* Rosina ǁHoabes, former mayor
* Werner Schulz (footballer)
* Peter Thiel, venture capitalist
* Razundara Tjikuzu, former professional footballer

==In popular culture==
Swakopmund was the filming location for &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;. In August 2008, filming commenced in Swakopmund on the AMC television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; starring Jim Caviezel and Sir Ian McKellen. In 2002, the city appeared on &quot;The Amazing Race 2&quot; and was visited again in &quot;The Amazing Race 26&quot;. In 2019, MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Challenge: War of the Worlds&quot; was filmed in Swakopmund, including the dunes of the Namib Desert and Swakopmund&#x27;s coast.

<text>The Mooney M20 is a family of piston-powered, four-seat, propeller-driven, general aviation aircraft, all featuring low wings and tricycle gear, manufactured by the Mooney International Corporation.

The M20 was the 20th design from Al Mooney, and his most successful. The series has been produced in many variations over the last 60 years, from the wooden-wing M20 and M20A models of 1955, to the M20V Acclaim Ultra that debuted in 2016. More than 11,000 aircraft in total have been produced across three production runs, with the most recent concluding in 2019.

In November 2008, the company announced that it was halting all production as a result of the late-2000s recession, but would still provide parts and support for the existing fleet. With the injection of Chinese capital after the company&#x27;s purchase, production of the M20 resumed in February 2014. Since then, the company has released two more M20 models.

==Development==
Al Mooney had been developing preliminary designs for the four-seater M20 for some time, while the single-seat M-18 Mite was in production in the late 1940s and early 1950s. When in early 1953 the company moved from Wichita, Kansas, to Kerrville, Texas, and when it became clear that the Mite was nearing the end of its production, development of the M20 accelerated. The first M20 flight took place on September 3, 1953, and it was certified on August 24, 1955.

During 1955, the company sold 10 of the M20 airplanes. Due to start-up costs, they lost about $3000 on each airplane. In 1956, they delivered 51 airplanes, and in 1957 the total was 105. The airplane gained attention because it was able to achieve speeds up to with a Lycoming O-320 engine. The combination of speed and efficiency was noteworthy. In 1958 the M20A joined the lineup with a larger Lycoming O-360-A1A engine, and by 1959, this was the only model offered, with a total sales that year of 231 units. This was the first year the company made a profit. The M20A continued production into 1960, when 166 were delivered. These were the last of the Mooneys to have wooden structures in the wings and tail. Early in the model&#x27;s history, several incidents of wooden tails breaking up in flight occurred due to water damage and the resulting rot. Consequently, most tails have now been replaced with all-metal copies, as required by Mooney Service Bulletin M20-170A and the FAA Airworthiness Directive 86-19-10. Without the possibility of metal fatigue, the wooden wing has an indefinite life expectancy and is considered by some pilots to provide a smoother ride in turbulence.

===1960s===

In January 1960, the Mooney company convinced Ralph Harmon to leave McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Missouri, and take over management of the engineering efforts. He insisted on replacing the wood in the M20 with aluminum, and the all-metal M20B was completed by the end of 1960, less than a year after his arrival. In 1961, the company sold 222 M20B airplanes. The following year, the M20C was introduced and 336 were sold that year. Also known as the Mark 21 and later the Ranger, the M20C had several improvements over the M20B, including greater deflection on control surfaces, reduced cowl flap openings for better engine cooling, improved exhaust scavenging with a Hanlon and Wilson exhaust system, new battery access door, more powerful landing light, lightweight floor, an increased gross weight of , lighter empty weight, new instrument panel layout, and a higher maximum flap angle of 33 degrees.
In 1963, the M20D was introduced, essentially an M20C with fixed landing gear and a fixed-pitch propeller. This had a slightly lower price than the M20C and was intended as a basic or trainer model which would have lower insurance costs and which would compete with the Piper Cherokee 180. It could be upgraded with retractable landing gear, and in fact, most of them were upgraded over the years. The M20D was produced from 1963 to 1966 with a total production of 161 units. In 1964 the M20E Super 21 was introduced. It was also based on the M20C but with a more powerful Lycoming fuel-injected engine. The company sold 366 M20E units that year.

In 1965, a new feature was introduced to the M20. It was called &quot;positive control&quot; and was a single-axis autopilot produced by Brittain Industries. It maintained the wings of the airplane in a level position unless a button on the control wheel was depressed for turns and banks. It was a controversial feature, liked by some pilots and disliked by others. Production and sales of the M20 continued to increase. In 1966, a total of 760 units were delivered, including 280 of the M20C Mark 21 planes and 473 of the M20E Super 21s. A new model, the M20F Executive 21, offered more legroom due to a increase in cabin length which also allowed for a third fuselage side window. It had of fuel capacity compared to in earlier models, and grossed an additional . This year, the company exceeded $1,000,000 in profits.

The M20G Statesman, a version of the M20F with less-powerful engine, was released in 1968. It had a larger airframe than the M20C, but the same engine, and as a result was slower. It was not as successful as the M20F and was produced for only three years, from 1968 to 1970, with a total production run of 189 units.

Despite strong sales, Mooney was short of cash. The company went into chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 1969, and was acquired by American Electronics Laboratories and then Butler Aviation International. Sales that year were less than half of the previous year&#x27;s figures, although a new version of the M20E Chaparral was released with electrically operated flaps and landing gear. Butler Aviation also acquired the troubled Aerostar company and combined it with Mooney in an attempt to save both. The Mooney name was dropped in 1970, as was the M20 designation; the planes were called Aerostars.

===1970s===

Butler Aviation closed the Mooney plant in early 1971, and it remained closed for more than two years. In October 1973, Mooney was purchased by Republic Steel. Robert Cumming, a general manager at Republic Steel, had owned a Mooney M20F Executive for years and flew it frequently, and wished to put the Mooney M20 back into production. This began in January 1974 with the reintroduction of the M20F Executive. Roy LoPresti, formerly of Grumman American, had been hired as the vice president of engineering. Through the efforts of his engineering group, various improvements were made to the M20 with the goal of increasing its speed, and the M20J was introduced in July 1976. It was also known as the Mooney 201 because it was capable of with its engine. The 201 was a big seller, and a turbocharged version was developed later that year. The next year, 1977, three models were offered: the M20C Ranger, the M20F Executive, and the M20J 201. By 1979, the M20C had been dropped, ending production of the short-body M20.

The same year, 1979, the company&#x27;s first turbocharged M20 was released: the M20K 231, so designated because its top speed was . It was based on the earlier 201 with further improvements. It had a wider wingspan and a six-cylinder Continental engine, and the fuel capacity was increased to . This year, a total of 439 airplanes were delivered—fewer than the top years of the 1960s, but these deliveries resulted in healthy profits. From this point through 1986, the M20J and the turbocharged M20K were the only two models offered.

===1980s===

General aviation manufacturing experienced a significant downturn starting in 1982. Mooney was affected along with other manufacturers and was forced to downsize through temporary layoffs. Despite the recession, development work continued. The 201 and 231 received more improvements, including significant reductions in cabin noise levels. In 1982, deliveries fell to 218 units, and in 1983 only 154 aircraft were produced. The United States Air Force announced a competition to develop a replacement for the Cessna T-41 trainer, and Mooney immediately began to develop a military trainer based on the 231.

While the company was dealing with the recession, Republic Steel was acquired by the Ling-Temco-Vought corporation and dropped Mooney. The company ended up in the hands of Armand Rivard of Lake Aircraft and Alexandre Couvelair, a Mooney dealer from Paris. Sales continued to fall, totaling 143 in 1984 and 99 in 1985.

The next new model, the M20K 252, appeared in early 1986 with a top speed of . It replaced the 231 and achieved its higher speed with the same engine. It featured a new 28-volt electrical system to power additional equipment and to improve cold-weather starting. The Continental TSIO-360-GB engine in the 231 had required specific pilot training and modified takeoff and climb procedures to operate at acceptable engine temperatures in hot weather. Because of this, the 252 received an intercooled TSIO-360-MB engine. The various improvements were copied to the 201 airframe, and the new 205 model was released in 1987.

This was followed in 1988 by the M20L PFM, powered by a Porsche PFM 3200 engine which had been developed from the 911 Carrera engine. The maximum speed with this configuration was . The fuselage was stretched to form the first long-body M20. One new feature on this airplane was the replacement of the throttle, mixture and propeller controls with a single power control; mixture and propeller rotation speed were automatically adjusted based on the setting of this single control. The Mooney PFM did not last, with a total of 41 units having been manufactured in 1988 and 1989. Most M20Ls no longer use this unique engine, as factory support ceased in 2005.

In February 1989, the next M20 model was released: the M20M TLS (Turbocharged Lycoming Sabre). It was powered, as the name hinted, by a turbocharged Lycoming six-cylinder engine that produced at 2,575 rpm, and it had a three-bladed propeller. It was capable of cruising at and had a range of and a maximum climb rate of per minute. The first year, the TLS accounted for 30 of the 143 aircraft delivered, and in 1990, this increased to 61 units. Also in 1989, Mooney released a trainer model based on the M20J. Beech, Cessna, and Piper had all stopped production of trainers throughout the 1980s, and the 201AT was designed to fill this gap. From 1989 to 1992, 20 units were delivered.

===1990s===

The next Mooney M20 model was the M20J 201, also designated the MSE, released in 1990 (although few were actually delivered prior to 1991). This was a non-turbocharged model that incorporated many features from the TLS. In early 1991, Mooney decided to offer its Enhanced Flight Screener Trainer model to the general public, given that the Air Force was slow to make a decision on its trainer. It was to have a Lycoming O-540 engine and would be rated for aerobatics. However, it generated little public interest. The TLS continued production through 1995, and the MSE continued, too, until it was replaced by the M20R Ovation in 1994. Once again, Mooney was offering two models: one offering high speed (the TLS) and the other offering high efficiency.

The M20T Predator, a canopy-equipped version of the basic M20 design powered by a Lycoming AEIO-540 engine, was Mooney&#x27;s entrant in the USAF Enhanced Flight Screener competition. The prototype, built in 1991, displayed in a tiger-stripe paint scheme. The sole prototype, registered N20XT, was flown in the Experimental – Market Survey category and was still owned by Mooney Aircraft in 2013, although its registration had expired November 30, 2013. The competition for the Enhanced Flight Screener program was finally held in 1992, and the Slingsby T67 Firefly was chosen instead of the Mooney EFS. Sales continued to drop, only reaching 64 units in 1993. The San Antonio location was sold and all operations returned to Kerrville. Development of the M20 continued, however, and the M20R Ovation was released in 1994. It was designed to fill a gap between the normally aspirated MSE and the turbocharged TLS, and it was powered by a Continental IO-550 engine. Of the 91 Mooney aircraft manufactured in 1995, 54 were Ovations. This model was named &quot;&quot;Flying&#x27;s&quot;&quot; single-engine plane of the year in 1994.

The following year, an upgraded model of the TLS with a more powerful Lycoming TIO-540-AF1B engine, was designated the M20M, but also was referred to as the &quot;Bravo&quot; due to the new B engine. This upgrade was offered to owners of earlier TLS models that had the TIO-540-AF1A engine. Soon after the release of the Bravo, the TKS ice protection system was offered for the Bravo and Ovation models. The M20K Encore was released in 1997, an M20K with more horsepower and a higher gross weight, giving it performance similar to the original M20K. It also had an improved interior and reduced cabin noise levels.

The M20S Eagle, released in 1999, was powered by a Continental IO-550-G. It was followed in 2001 by the Eagle 2. This model included refinements such as a standard leather interior. The Eagle 2 also used the same 3 blade propeller as the original versions of the M20R and was produced from 1994 to 1999.

===2000s===

The M20TN Acclaim was released in 2006, powered by a turbonormalized Continental TSIO-550-G powerplant with twin turbochargers and dual intercoolers. The Acclaim replaced the Mooney M20M Bravo in the company product line.

Mooney laid off 60 employees in June 2008 and cut production, citing a weak economy and sales inhibited by high fuel prices. Later that year, in November, all production was halted.

In July 2008, Mooney signed a memorandum of understanding with Rolls-Royce to develop a version of the M20 that was to have been powered by the Rolls-Royce RR500 TP turboprop powerplant. The project was announced as being a joint &quot;marketing investigation&quot; and &quot;exploration project&quot;, but does not appear to have come to fruition.

===2010s===
More employees were laid off in late 2010. The stated goal was to have fewer than 10 employees at the start of 2011, with these employees providing parts and support to existing aircraft owners while the company searched for new investment. This search ended in late 2013; Chinese investment enabled the company to resume production in early 2014. Later that year, the M10T and the M10J were announced, both to be powered by Continental diesel engines.

Two new models were released in 2016: the M20U Ovation Ultra and the M20V Acclaim Ultra. The M20U was based on the M20R, and its first flight was on June 4, 2016. It was the first M20 to have a pilot-side door. It also featured a composite shell forward fuselage which replaced the traditional aluminum skin. The M20V, which was developed from the M20TN Acclaim, had those features, as well.

The company closed its doors and laid off all staff on November 12, 2019. The company reopened and staff returned to work on December 2, 2019.

==Design==
With the exception of the earliest models which had wings and tails with wooden frames, M20s are constructed entirely of metal. All are low-wing aircraft, and the wing skin is aluminum. Slotted flaps cover 70% of the trailing edge. Earlier models use a hydraulic hand pump to extend the flaps, while later models have electrically operated flaps. The forward fuselage has a steel-tube cabin structure covered in aluminum skin; the aft portion of the fuselage is of semi-monocoque design. In many places on the skin of the airplane, flush-mounted rivets are used to reduce drag.

The landing gear on the Mooney M20 are made of heat-treated chrome-molybdenum steel. The main landing gear is attached to the main wing spar, while the nose gear is mounted to the tubular steel frame. Stacks of rubber shock discs act as shock absorbers. All models, with the exception of the M20D Master, came with retractable landing gear; on these models, the nose wheel retracts rearwards and the main wheels retract inwards. Early models use a hand-operated lever system to raise and lower the gear. The manually actuated landing gear are raised by unlocking the lever, which is called a &quot;Johnson Bar&quot; (named after the Johnson Bar (locomotive)), from just below the throttle, rotating it to the floor, and locking it into a fixture on the floor. Lowering the landing gear require the same operations in opposite order. Al Mooney got his start working as young man for the railroad industry, hence the borrowing of a steam locomotive term for use in describing part of an aircraft. Starting in 1969, electrically operated landing gear became standard.

The Mooney M20 has medium aspect-ratio tapered wings with 1.5 degrees of washout and 5.5 degrees of dihedral. Later models were equipped with stall strips to improve the stall characteristics.

The empennage of the Mooney M20 is easily recognizable by its unique tail fin with a vertical leading edge. (The tail fin looks as though it is &quot;leaning forward&quot;, but it is approximately vertical in level flight, depending on trim setting.) The horizontal tailplane, which consists of fixed stabilizers and trailing elevators, has no trim tabs. The entire tail assembly pivots at the rear of the fuselage to provide pitch trim.

All M20s store fuel in two separate &quot;wet wing&quot; tanks, which are located in the inboard sections of each wing. Fuel is driven from the tank to the injectors or carburetor by an engine-driven pump, backed up with an electric boost pump.

For increased power, many M20s also have a ram-air induction system, called the Mooney &quot;Power Boost&quot;. For normal operations, the intake air is filtered before it enters the induction system. When ram air is selected, partially unfiltered air enters the induction system with a higher pressure and consequently the manifold pressure increases about a full inch of mercury flying at 7500 feet above mean sea level, giving a greater power output. The turbocharged variants omit this feature, as the turbocharger provides a far greater increase in manifold pressure.

The Mooney M20 series has been produced in three fuselage lengths: the &quot;short-body&quot; (M20 through M20E), &quot;medium-body&quot; (M20F through M20K), and &quot;long-body&quot; (M20L through M20V). Although all M20s have four seats, the fuselage length increase provided more rear passenger legroom, but with a slight performance decrease: for a similar engine and vintage, a long-body plane is 4 to 6 knots slower than the short-body plane.

==Operational history==
In August 2017, 6,748 Mooney M20 aircraft were registered with US Federal Aviation Administration, 342 with Transport Canada, and 33 in the United Kingdom with the Civil Aviation Authority. As of July 2018, 154 M20 aircraft were registered with Australia&#x27;s CASA.

In June and July, 2017, pilot Brian Lloyd flew his Mooney M20K 231 around the world, commemorating Amelia Earhart&#x27;s attempted circumnavigation which took place 80 years earlier in 1937. Lloyd followed a route similar to the one taken by Earhart.

==Variants==
===Modifications===
Mooneys derive their performance from a clean airframe, small cabin cross-section, and drag reducing refinements over the years. Many of these refinements are supplemental type certificate (STC) modifications to the airframe developed by aftermarket businesses. Some of these modifications have been incorporated into the factory production models.

====305 Rocket====
In 1990, Rocket Engineering Corp. of Spokane, Washington, modified an M20K 231 model by replacing the standard turbocharged Continental TSIO-360 engine and two-blade propeller with a turbocharged Continental TSIO-520-NB and a McCauley three-blade propeller. This engine and propeller combination had previously been proven on the twin-engined Cessna 340 and Cessna 414. Marketed as the 305 Rocket, this variant delivered a 228-knot speed and 1,600 feet/minute rate of climb. This significantly increased performance, but at the expense of higher fuel consumption.

The 305 Rocket STC represented a year certification effort, including 1,000 flight test hours. The plane passed all FAA flight test requirements, including spin, flutter, load, cooling, and noise tests. The STC covered both the 231 and 252 M20K variants. While the 231 and 252 had a maximum certified altitude of 24,000 ft (7,300 m) and 28,000 ft (8,500 m), respectively, the engineering goal of the 305 Rocket was certification for a maximum altitude of 31,000 ft (9,500 m). Extending the altitude in the STC was abandoned due to cost/benefit considerations versus the difficulty of demonstrating compliance with the FAA requirements, plus required changes to the supplemental oxygen systems in this unpressurized aircraft. The aircraft will, however, climb at nearly 1,000 ft/min above 24,000 ft (7,300 m). The Rocket conversion was discontinued by Rocket Engineering. The production-version Mooney Acclaim now delivers faster speeds. As Rockets are available in the used market for about one-third the cost of a new Acclaim, it maintains its popularity among a small market niche.

==Aircraft on display==
The Mooney M20H engineering prototype is on display at Jandakot Airport in Jandakot, Western Australia. The aircraft is painted to represent the M20E used by Robin Miller, an Australian female pilot known as the &quot;Sugar Bird Lady&quot; for her work in distributing the polio vaccine across Australia.

<text>Man O&#x27; War (sometimes also written as &quot;Manowar&quot;) is a now out-of-print table top war game by Games Workshop. The game was set in the same realm of Warhammer Fantasy as used for the Warhammer Fantasy Battle and included most of the factions from that setting. Other races of the Warhammer world were not included, either because they were lacking seafaring abilities (Wood Elves), missing from the main factions at that time (Ogres, Lizardmen), or both.

The game name coming from &quot;Man-of-war&quot;, it dealt with the sea battles of the Warhammer world; each player controlling a fleet of model ships. The game typically used a small number of models with half a dozen to a dozen models per player. Each model had a corresponding template to record damage, crew levels, and outbreaks of fire, among other bookkeeping activities. Some innovations were present, such as alternate unit activation.

== Forces ==

Ships were designated as belonging to one of 3 categories. The largest and most powerful ships were the Men O&#x27; War (MOW). These command ships operated singularly and usually carried the fleet Admiral and Wizard (if available). Men O&#x27; War were the most powerful ships in the game and they could typically take heavy punishment before sinking. Ships of the Line (SOL) varied in size and firepower and were operated in squadrons of 3. One ship in the squadron was designated as a flagship and the other ships in the squadron had to stay within 6&quot; of it to receive orders or else they would become stragglers and suffer various penalties. Independents (INDs) were similar to Men O&#x27; War in that they operated singly, but were much less powerful and tended to be unique in some way, making their classification as a SOL less appropriate.

By the time all the supplements had been published &quot;Man O&#x27; War&quot; supported the following fleets:

*The Empire
*Bretonnia
*Dwarfs
*High Elves

The boxed game included twelve plastic models (rowed galleys), sufficient to learn the basics of play in scenarios between &quot;pirates&quot; and &quot;the Empire&quot;, but the other ships in the Empire&#x27;s fleet and those for the other races were metal models. These came in small boxes rather than blister packs. Each box had the metal parts for the model ship (or ships - smaller ships came three to a box) and printed sails and flags with plastic masts (as applicable). These miniatures are now considered out of print. The boxed game contained land features in the form of printed card shapes as well as the printed templates.

The game was removed from store shelves in 1995, but remained available through mail order in selected countries, like the US. It reached a final &quot;out of print&quot; status in 1998. It seems that the miniature moulds had worn out because of the high number of duplicates; the Bretonnian Corsairs were the first units to be unavailable.

==Supplements==

Two boxed supplements were published by Games Workshop each with a different focus on what they added to the game system. They were designed along with the boxed game, but released later to give the impression of an expanded product line.

&quot;Plague Fleet&quot; was the first expansion and its scope was to expand the total number of available fleets in the game. It included the cards and rules necessary to field the fleets of the forces of Chaos - ships for followers of the 4 Chaos gods (Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle), as well as rules and templates for Skaven and Chaos Dwarf ships.

&quot;Sea of Blood&quot; focus was more on expanding the overall game elements as it added only one more fleet (that being the Norse). New rules and cards for adding both &quot;Sea Monsters&quot; and &quot;Flyers&quot; were included in this expansion. Sea Monsters and Beasts were additional &quot;ships&quot; that could be added to any fleet regardless of which race they were playing. This was generally seen as a good addition by most players - especially considering that many fleets consisted of just three ship types and adding these creatures allowed for more flexibility when purchasing a fleet. Sea of Blood added the following &quot;Sea Monsters&quot; and &quot;Beasts&quot; to the game: Triton, Sea Elemental, Kraken, Sea Dragon, Megalodon, Promethean, Black Leviathan, Gargantuan and Behemoth.

Flyers added an aerial dimension to battles and 1 or 2 new creatures or machines were added to each of the existing races - again, expanding the choices for each admiral. Many considered the Flyer squadron rules to be unbalanced in many respects, and they have been the object of much discussion on gaming forums dedicated to Man O&#x27; War.

Rules for another two types of Empire ship, a Dwarf &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and shore forts were also included to round out the Sea of Blood expansion.

Following the release of these supplements a series of articles which provided additional rules for &quot;Man O&#x27;War&quot; were published in issues the &quot;Citadel Journal&quot;. Number 6 (of the 2nd series) provided rules for an Undead fleet though no miniatures were ever modelled by Citadel.

==Fleets==
The Bretonnian fleet was modelled on ships of the 17th century while the Empire tended more towards the look of earlier time (the inverse of their land armies). The Empire had ships with both oars and sails with the exception of the &quot;Great-Ship&quot; which was sail only. The Empire also had ships that carried single large cannon or mortars. The Empire&#x27;s flying units were Griffin riders.

Dwarf ships were steam powered ironclads, they also had submarines and balloons.

High Elf ships were fast manoeuvrable sail powered catamarans. By comparison Dark Elves mainly used great sea creatures as the basis for their &quot;ships&quot; - their largest ship, the &quot;Black Ark&quot; could house several monster-ships within for protection.

Orc ships tended towards the ramshackle and unorthodox, with large paddle driven hulks and inaccurate stone throwers as their sole armament.

Chaos Dwarf fleets consisted of various types of Battlebarge, each mounting a larger version of their tabletop artillery, the death rocket and Earthshaker.

Norse fleets were modelled on Viking longships and carried no weapons. To offset this, the Norse had a variety of specialist crew types such as Berserkers and Ulfwerener (werewolves) and excelled at performing boarding actions.

==Reception==
Chris McDonough reviewed &quot;Man O&#x27; War&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #35 (March/April, 1993), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Not many new games are as truly inspired and exciting as Game Workshop&#x27;s &quot;Man O&#x27; War&quot; game. For all you GW fans out there, this one is a masterpiece.&quot;

<text>Space Hulk is a board game for two players produced by Games Workshop. It was originally released in 1989. The game is set in the fictional universe of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. In the game, a &quot;space hulk&quot; is a mass of ancient, derelict space ships, asteroids, and other assorted space debris. One player takes the role of Space Marine Terminators, superhuman elite soldiers who have been sent to investigate such a space hulk. The second player takes the role of Tyranid Genestealers, the vanguard of an aggressive alien species which have made their home aboard the derelict ship.

== Background ==
In &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, the term &quot;space hulk&quot; is used to refer to any massive derelict space ship that drifts through the vacuum of the galaxy without apparent direction. Since the hulks often exit and re-enter the Warp seemingly at random, searching or travelling within them is dangerous in the extreme, however the Imperium often takes the risk of exploring these hulks for valuable millennia-old technology and artifacts. Space hulks may house more than just Genestealers; other threats aboard can include human followers of the dark gods of Chaos, nightmarish Warp Daemons, and Orks who use space hulks as their &quot;standard&quot; method of interstellar travel. The only realistic means of stopping such threats to the Imperium is to send boarding parties to clear out these infested hulks, as they are often so huge that they can easily shrug off all but the heaviest naval firepower while having their own atmosphere and gravity. 

Genestealers were described in an entry of the &quot;Aliens and monsters&quot; section of the first edition of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; (the &quot;WH40K - Rogue Trader&quot; manual). However Genestealers were redesigned for &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, being influenced by the xenomorphs depicted in the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise. The expanded and rewritten game lore cast Genestealers as a sub-species and shock troops of the all-consuming Tyranids alien race, and of particular note is that Genestealers infiltrate/infect the local populace of target planets to cause civil unrest in advance of an invasion of their Tyranid Hive Fleet.

Space Marine Terminators are described in game lore as first company veterans in each Space Marine Chapter, having earned the right to don the sacred Terminator Armor, making them more powerful and resilient but slower than regular Marines, so Terminators are normally used in close quarter battle environments. Space Marine Terminators were originally only used in Space Hulk-type scenarios, but rules were added in White Dwarf magazine and subsequent releases of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; for the inclusion of Terminators as a small/elite part of a Marine army on the open battlefield. 

Besides a space hulk, similar skirmishes between Space Marine Terminators and Genestealers can also be set in other environments.

== Gameplay ==

The game is set on a modular board made up of various board sections which represent corridors and rooms and which can be freely arranged and locked together like a jigsaw puzzle to represent the interior of a space hulk. One player controls the Space Marine Terminators, and the other player controls the Tyranid Genestealers.

It is an asymmetric game in the following respects:
*The two players have different forces.
*The players have different objectives to fulfill during a &quot;mission&quot; (the in-game term for a particular scenario). For example, the Terminator player may have the objective of destroying a specified area of the board or a specified Genestealer piece or some other objective; while the Genestealer player may have the objective of destroying a specified Terminator piece or all of the Terminator pieces or some other objective.
*The pieces of the two players move at different rates (Terminators move slowly, Genestealers rapidly).
*Terminator pieces excel at ranged combat, but are weak in close combat; the Genestealer pieces excel at close combat, but cannot perform ranged combat at all.

The pieces are moved by the players through a system of &quot;action points&quot;, where each piece has a certain number specified for it. A Terminator piece has few action points; a Genestealer piece has many action points.

The game is notable for its hidden play mechanics, from which it derives much of its playability and tension.

On the one hand, the Terminator player has a variable number of &quot;command points&quot; available each turn which are only revealed to the Genestealer player after they are used up; these command points may be used to move the Terminator pieces either during the Terminator player&#x27;s own turn or during the Genestealer player&#x27;s turn. (In the second edition, the extra points were not hidden from the Genestealer player.)
On the other hand, the actual number of Genestealer pieces in play is hidden from the Terminator player, because the Genestealer pieces come into play as &quot;blips&quot; which may represent multiple creatures. (1-3 creatures in the 1st, 3rd and 4th editions; 0-6 in the 2nd edition; 0-3 in the &quot;Deathwing&quot; expansion; and 1-6 in the &quot;Genestealer&quot; expansion.)

In the basic version of the game, playing as the Terminators can be engaging and tactically challenging, partly because the Terminator player is constrained by a time limit for their turn, while playing as the Genestealers can be very straightforward. To overcome this asymmetry, players are encouraged to play each mission of the game twice, swapping between playing with Terminators and playing with Genestealers. The fairly fast play time (around half an hour per mission), driven by the Terminator player&#x27;s time limitation, makes this feasible.

The &quot;Deathwing&quot; expansion pack for the first edition included rules for playing the game as a one-player game—that is, playing the game as Terminators using different mechanics for moving the Genestealer pieces. There is also the addition of the Captain and Librarian, plus further Terminator weapons into the game, which greatly expanded the Terminator player&#x27;s tactical capabilities. For instance, Terminators could be configured as melee specialists in lieu of carrying ranged weapons.

The &quot;Genestealer&quot; expansion pack for the first edition included rules for human-genestealer hybrids, which could carry weapons and equipment, and for a Magus and for a Patriarch, adding more depth for the Genestealer player. However, these additions were not carried over in the second or the third or the fourth editions, although the third and the fourth editions did include rules for a Broodlord.

== Editions ==

=== First edition ===
The first edition of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was released in May 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK White Dwarf WD113 05/1989&quot;&gt;UK &quot;White Dwarf&quot; WD113 05/1989&lt;/ref&gt;

This edition was further expanded with additional scenarios and rules in articles in the magazines &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Citadel Journal&quot;.
The early articles from &quot;White Dwarf&quot; were collected and published as two separate expansion packs, and most of the later articles from &quot;White Dwarf&quot; were collected and published as a book:

* &quot;Deathwing&quot;, a box set, was released in 1990. It introduced the Deathwing Company (First Company) of the Dark Angels Space Marines Chapter, including the Captain and the Librarian and additional Terminator weapons into the game, which greatly expanded the tactical possibilities for the Terminator player. Among other things the expansion pack also featured rules for the Space Marine player to play the game solo, and it included additional board sections.
* &quot;Genestealer&quot;, a box set, was released in 1990. It introduced the Genestealer Cult including Human-Genestealer Hybrids and the Magus and the Patriarch into the game, which greatly expanded the tactical possibilities for the Genestealer player. Among other things, the expansion pack also featured rules for an elaborate system of psychic combat, and it included additional board sections.
* &quot;Space Hulk Campaigns&quot;, a hardback book, was released in 1991 and later reprinted as a paperback in 1993. It introduced rules for Imperial Space Marine Terminators against Chaos Space Marine Terminators, and rules for Space Marines in Power Armour, and it included additional board sections.

=== Second edition ===
The second edition of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was released in April 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK White Dwarf WD196 04/1996&quot;&gt;UK &quot;White Dwarf&quot; WD196 04/1996&lt;/ref&gt;

This edition featured revamped board artwork and miniatures. It featured two identical plastic five-man Terminator squads with standard weaponry and assorted Genestealers.

This edition significantly simplified the rules compared to those of the 1st edition, and it offered less opportunity for expansion, due to the specific dice used for the game. A critical change was made to the Command Point system, no longer allowing them to be used in the enemy turn, altering the strategic complexity of the game. The rules for the heavy flamer were also changed, and the difference between the standard weapons and the area effect flamer was reduced.

This edition was further expanded with additional scenarios and rules in articles in the magazines &quot;White Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Citadel Journal&quot;, such as &quot;Defilement of Honour&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UK White Dwarf WD197 05/1996&quot;&gt;UK &quot;White Dwarf&quot; WD197 05/1996&lt;/ref&gt; which involves rules for air ducts, a new kind of board section which allows Genestealers to move off the main board and back onto it from one place to another place, and &quot;Fangs of Fenris&quot; which involves Wolf Guard Terminators of the Space Wolves Space Marines Chapter.
However the articles from &quot;White Dwarf&quot; were never collected and published as any expansion pack.

=== Third edition ===
The third edition of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; was released in September 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK White Dwarf WD257 09/2009&quot;&gt;UK &quot;White Dwarf&quot; WD257 09/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The mail order stocks sold out three days before release, and most Games Workshop retail outlets were sold out within a week of release. Games Workshop announced no plans to reprint this edition of the game as it was intended to be a limited release.

This edition featured new sculpts designed specifically for &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, instead of being shared with the sets for the tabletop game &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. Advancements in sculpting and moulding have allowed Games Workshop&#x27;s Alex Hedström to add a greater level of detail to the miniatures. Each of the twelve miniatures representing Terminators has a distinct appearance, such as Brother Omnio being shown consulting a scanner mounted in his Power Fist. The miniatures representing Genestealers were depicted in various poses, with one bursting up from the floor and another climbing down from the wall. The counters and the board sections of the game were made using new debossing techniques which applied shallow depressions into the cardboard. These board sections were additionally much thicker and heavier than those of previous editions. The Games Workshop studio and box art represents the Blood Angels Space Marine Chapter.

The rules were modernised to some extent, but were largely similar to those of the 1st edition. One critical rule change was that a Terminator jamming his gun on overwatch does not lose the overwatch status. Also, a new rule, allowing a Terminator to go on guard (essentially a close combat version of overwatch), was added.

A reissue of the third edition was released on September 20, 2014.

Although the Games Workshop website sold out of Space Hulk less than 24 hours after it was available for pre-order, most stores had a number of copies available to buy on release day.
The game was largely a re-release of the third edition with a few rules tweaked. It featured additional board sections and missions, plus refreshed graphical presentation of the existing art assets.

Three expansion campaigns were released specifically for iPad.
These campaigns chronicle other Space Marine chapters, and they include rules for additional Space Marine Terminator troopers and weapons.

* Space Hulk Mission Files: Dark Angels - Bringer of Sorrow
* Space Hulk Mission Files: Space Wolves - Return to Kalidus
* Space Hulk Mission Files: Ultramarines - Duty and Honour

== Spin-offs ==
Two types of spin-offs of the board game have been released - a video game and a card game.

=== Video games ===
Numerous video games based on the &quot;Space Hulk&quot; board game have been released.

&quot;Space Hulk&quot;, released in 1993, is a real-time tactical game for PC (MS-DOS) and Amiga, developed and published by Electronic Arts. Using overhead maps, the player orders the Marine squads, and controls individual Marines via first-person shooter interfaces. The game features a time-limited option to pause the action while enabling the player to continue issuing commands. The Space Marines featured in this game are the Deathwing (1st Company) from the Dark Angels Chapter.

A game titled &quot;Aspect Warriors&quot; was under development and planned to be published by Electronic Arts for the Sega Mega Drive but it was never released.

&quot;Space Hulk: Vengeance of the Blood Angels&quot; was released by Electronic Arts in 1995 and 1996, on PC, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and 3DO. The sequel to the 1993 video game, &quot;Vengeance of the Blood Angels&quot; combines first-person shooter gameplay with real-time tactical elements.

In 2005, a mobile phone version called &quot;Warhammer: Space Hulk&quot; was released. This game replicated the board game&#x27;s play mechanics and allowed play as either Space Marines or Genestealers.

In 2008, a small group of hobbyists released a PC conversion of the board game, along with assorted scenarios, for free over the Internet. However, within a month the game was removed from the developers&#x27; site. They noted that the web download traffic was creating problems, and that Games Workshop were threatening legal action due to THQ&#x27;s current ownership of the &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; video game license. According to the development team, their attempts to negotiate for the release of the game with THQ were refused, resulting in the game being rebranded under the name &quot;Alien Assault&quot;. A fan-made game called &quot;NetHulk&quot; is currently available as freeware. It allows two players to compete head-to-head over an internet or LAN connection, or in a hotseat mode. The game&#x27;s rules do not strictly adhere to the board game, but are a hybrid of the first and second editions. &quot;QSpacehulk&quot; is another fan-made freeware available which strictly follows the rules of the second edition.

&quot;Space Hulk&quot; is a video game for PC (Windows) and Mac and Linux by Copenhagen-based game developer Full Control ApS. It was released in August 2013. The game has received mixed reviews, holding a rating of 59 (out of 100, based on 4 reviews) on review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;Space Hulk: Ascension&quot; is a video game for PC (Windows), Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4 by Full Control ApS. It was released in November 2014 for PC.

&quot;Space Hulk: Deathwing&quot; is a tactical first-person shooter developed by Streum On Studio released in 2016 for the PC and PlayStation 4. It expands the gameplay environment, beyond the narrow maze-like corridors of the original board game and earlier video games, to include massive space ship interiors such as a cathedral. The story is co-written by Gav Thorpe, a longtime Games Workshop author and games designer.

Space Hulk: Tactics, released in 2018, is a video game for PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One. It was developed by Cyanide Studio and published by Focus Home Interactive.

=== Card game ===
One official card game has been released.

&quot;Space Hulk: Death Angel — The Card Game&quot; is a card game using a special die for one to six players by Fantasy Flight Games. It was released in 2010.

Four expansion packs have been released:

* &quot;Death Angel: Mission Pack 1 Expansion&quot;
* &quot;Death Angel: Space Marine Pack 1 Expansion&quot;
* &quot;Death Angel: Tyranid Enemy Pack&quot;
* &quot;Death Angel: Deathwing Space Marine Pack&quot;

== Reception==
In the August 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue #8), Brian Walker admired the professional production quality of this game. However, he found the game lacked play balance, since the space marines nearly always lost badly. He concluded by giving the game a poor rating of only 2 out of 5, saying, &quot;There are some great ideas buried deep in the bowels of &quot;Space Hulk&quot;, but at the moment ideas is all they are.&quot;

Two issues later, in the November 1989 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 10), &quot;Space Hulk&quot;″s rating was raised to 3 out of 5, with the comment &quot;Upgraded one star since our original review [...] as subsequent scenarios proved to be more balanced.&quot;

In Issue 43 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, John Theisen commented, &quot;There&#x27;s something very different about this game. Maybe it’s the ugly nature of the opponent, or maybe it’s just the odds.&quot; Theisen liked the components and artwork, calling them &quot;up to Games Workshop’s usual high standard for quality and use of color.&quot; He found that &quot;&quot;Space Hulk&quot; is easy to learn and (I would venture to guess) very difficult to master.&quot; Theisen concluded, &quot;&quot;Space Hulk&quot; possesses too many tactical subtleties to evaluate and has the potential for too many new scenarios to design to permit any dust to accumulate on it for very long. [...] Despite its high price, I recommend &quot;Space Hulk&quot; — or, to quote an Australian friend of mine, &#x27;This one’s a ripper!&#x27;&quot;

In the April 1991 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 168), Ken Rolston called the 1st edition of the game &quot;excellent&quot;, commenting on the &quot;Expensive and elegant components, lovely alien Genestealer and Space Marine models, simple systems, and exceptionally clear rules with lots of helpful diagrams.&quot; He also complimented the &quot;fast pace of play and lots of action and mayhem.&quot; 

In Issue 22 of &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot;, Artur Marciniak reviewed the Polish language version of the game, and although he found the translation almost as good as the original edition, he bemoaned some of the translation issues, saying, &quot;Unfortunately, the translation of the rules of the game leaves a lot to be desired. Bizarre syntax, English terms left untranslated (including some quite important ones), it all worked to reduce my satisfaction with the Polish release of this game.&quot;

In the May 1996 edition of &quot;Arcane&quot; (Issue 6), Mark Donald questioned its replayability and rated the 2nd Edition of &quot;Space Hulk&quot; a 7 out of 10, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s a fun game, a doddle to play, but it&#x27;ll probably fade away to nothing once the initial playing frenzy is spent and all the missions have been played through to completion.&quot;

&quot;Space Hulk&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Matt Forbeck commented, &quot;&quot;Space Hulk&quot; taught me more about elegance in design than any other game. It&#x27;s an icon of well-nested mechanics that build a system far greater than its parts. Better yet, every part of the game works to support not only each other but the game&#x27;s underlying metaphor, giving a united play experience that&#x27;s unmatched.&quot;

==Awards==
* &quot;Space Hulk&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1989&quot;. 
* One of its first expansions, &quot;Genestealers&quot;, won the Origins Awards the following year for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1990&quot;.
* &quot;Space Hulk&quot; won the 2009 Origins Award for Best Board Game.

<text>Teleostomi (from Greek τελεος, complete + Greek στόμα, mouth) is an obsolete taxon of jawed vertebrates that supposedly includes the tetrapods, bony fish, and the wholly extinct acanthodian fish. Key characters of this group include an operculum and a single pair of respiratory openings, features which were lost or modified in some later representatives. The teleostomes include all jawed vertebrates except the chondrichthyans and the extinct class Placodermi.

Recent studies indicate that Osteichthyes evolved from placoderms like &quot;Entelognathus&quot;, while acanthodians are more closely related to modern chondrichthyes. Teleostomi, therefore, is not a valid, natural clade, but a paraphyletic group of species.

The clade Teleostomi should not be confused with the similar-sounding infraclass Teleostei.

== Origins ==
The origins of the teleostomes are obscure. They are traditionally assumed to be descendants of the Acanthodians (&quot;spiny sharks&quot;) from the Early Silurian Period; however, more recent discoveries show that the &quot;spiny sharks&quot; are actually a paraphyletic assemblage leading to Chondrichthyes, and that placoderms like &quot;Entelognathus&quot; are more closely related to true bony fish. Living teleostomes constitute the clade Euteleostomi, which includes all osteichthyans and tetrapods. Even after the acanthodians perished at the end of the Permian, their euteleostome relatives flourished such that today they comprise 99% of living vertebrate species.

== Physical characteristics ==
Teleostomes have two major adaptations that relate to aquatic respiration. First, the early teleostomes probably had some type of operculum; however, it was not the one-piece affair of living fish. The development of a single respiratory opening seems to have been an important step. The second adaptation, the teleostomes also developed a primitive lung with the ability to use some atmospheric oxygen. This developed, in later species, into the lung and (later) the swim bladder, used to keep the fish at neutral buoyancy.

Acanthodians share with Actinopterygians the characteristic of three otoliths, the sagitta in the sacculus, the asteriscus in the lagena, and the lapillus in the utriculus. In dipnoans there are only two otoliths and in &quot;Latimeria&quot; there is only one.

However, most of the above synapomorphies can ultimately be found in several chondrichthyan groups.

<text>I Know Where I&#x27;m Going! is a 1945 romance film directed and written by the British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It stars Wendy Hiller and Roger Livesey, and features Pamela Brown.

==Plot==
Joan Webster is a 25-year-old, middle-class Englishwoman with an ambitious, independent spirit, who always &quot;knows where she&#x27;s going&quot;. She travels from her home in Manchester to the isle of Kiloran in the Hebrides to marry Sir Robert Bellinger, a very wealthy, much older industrialist.

When bad weather postpones the final leg of her journey (the boat trip to Kiloran), she is forced to wait it out on the Isle of Mull, among a community of people whose values are quite different from hers. There she meets Torquil MacNeil, a Royal Navy officer trying to go home to Kiloran while on shore leave. She also meets some of the residents, such as the boatman Ruairidh Mhór, the eccentric falconer Colonel Barnstaple, and the poor but proud Catriona Potts, a friend of Torquil&#x27;s who takes them in for the night.

The next day, on their way to catch a bus to Tobermory to use the radio, Joan and Torquil come upon the ruins of Moy Castle. Joan wants to look inside, but Torquil refuses to enter. When she reminds him that the terrible curse associated with it only applies to the laird of Kiloran, he reveals that &quot;he&quot; is the laird; Bellinger is only renting his island. On the bus, the locals, unaware of Joan&#x27;s identity, recount disparaging stories about Bellinger.

In Tobermory, Joan and Torquil use the radio, and Torquil gets two hotel rooms. When they go into the hotel&#x27;s restaurant, she asks him to sit at a different table. As the bad weather worsens into a full-scale gale, Torquil spends more time with Joan, who becomes torn between her ambition and her growing attraction to him. The two attend a ceilidh celebrating a couple&#x27;s diamond wedding anniversary; the three bagpipers hired to play at Joan&#x27;s wedding perform. Torquil translates the song &quot;Nut-Brown Maiden&quot; for Joan, emphasising the line &quot;You&#x27;re the maid for me.&quot; Despite Joan&#x27;s hesitancy, Torquil persuades her to dance.

Desperate to salvage her carefully laid plans, Joan convinces Ruairidh Mhór&#x27;s young assistant, Kenny, to attempt the crossing for £20. Unable to talk Joan out of the highly dangerous trip, Torquil invites himself aboard after Catriona tells him that Joan is running away from him. En route, the boat is caught in the Corryvreckan whirlpool, but Torquil restarts the flooded engine just in time. The trio return safely to Mull.

Finally, the weather clears. Joan asks Torquil for a parting kiss. Afterward, Torquil enters Moy Castle and finds the inscription of the curse: &quot;If he [any MacNeil of Kiloran] shall ever cross the threshold of Moy never shall he leave it a free man. He shall be chained to a woman to the end of his days and shall die in his chains.&quot; Centuries earlier, Torquil&#x27;s ancestor stormed the castle and captured his unfaithful wife and her lover. He had them bound together and cast into the water-filled dungeon, which had a stone just big enough for one person to stand on. When their strength gave out, they dragged each other into the water, but not before she placed the curse. It takes effect immediately. From the battlements, Torquil sees Joan marching resolutely towards him, accompanied by the three pipers, playing &quot;Nut-Brown Maiden&quot;. The couple meet in the castle and embrace. &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going&quot; is sung as the end credits roll.

==Production==
===Development===
Powell and Pressburger wanted to make &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; but filming was held up because they wanted to do the film in colour and there was a shortage of colour cameras. (Technicolor cameras and technical specialists were mostly in Hollywood during the Second World War.)

Pressburger suggested that instead they make a film that was part of the &quot;crusade against materialism&quot;, a theme they had tackled in &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot;, only in a more accessible romantic comedy format.

The story was originally called &quot;The Misty Island&quot;. Pressburger wanted to make a film about a girl who wants to get to an island, but by the end of the film no longer wants to. Powell suggested an island on Scotland&#x27;s west coast. He and Pressburger spent several weeks researching locations and decided on the Isle of Mull.

Pressburger wrote the screenplay in four days. &quot;It just burst out, you couldn&#x27;t hold back,&quot; he said.

The movie was originally meant to star Deborah Kerr and James Mason but Kerr could not get out of her contract with MGM, so they cast Wendy Hiller. Hiller was originally cast in the three roles Kerr played in &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; but had to withdraw when she became pregnant.

Six weeks before filming, Mason pulled out of the movie, saying he did not want to go on location. Roger Livesey read the script and asked to play the role. Powell thought he was too old and portly but Livesey lost &quot;ten or twelve pounds&quot; (four or five kilos) and lightened his hair; Powell was convinced.

Powell&#x27;s golden cocker spaniels Erik and Spangle made their third appearance in an Archers film: previously in &quot;Contraband&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), they were later also to be seen in &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946).

Pressburger later said that when he visited Paramount Pictures in 1947 the head of the script department told him they considered the film&#x27;s screenplay perfect and frequently watched it for inspiration.

===Filming===
Shooting took place on the Isle of Mull and at Denham Film Studios.

It was the second and last collaboration between the co-directors and cinematographer Erwin Hillier (who shot the entire film without a light meter).

The heroine of the film is trying to get to &quot;Kiloran&quot;, but nobody ever gets there. From various topographical references and a map briefly shown in the film, it is clear that the Isle of Kiloran is based on Colonsay, south of Mull. The name Kiloran was borrowed from one of Colonsay&#x27;s bays, Kiloran Bay. No footage was shot on Colonsay.

One of the most complex scenes shows the small boat battling the Corryvreckan whirlpool. This was a combination of footage shot at Corryvreckan between the Hebridean islands of Scarba and Jura, and Bealach a&#x27;Choin Ghlais (Sound of the Grey Dogs) between Scarba and Lunga.
*There are some long-distance shots looking down over the area, shot from one of the islands.
*There are some middle-distance and close-up shots that were made from a small boat with a hand-held camera.
*There were some model shots, done in the tank at the studio. These had gelatin added to the water so that it would hold its shape better and would look better when scaled up. 
*The close-up shots of the people in the boat were all done in the studio, with a boat on gimbals being rocked in all directions by some hefty studio hands while others threw buckets of water at them. These were filmed with the shots made from the boat with the hand-held camera projected behind them.
*Further trickery joined some of the long- and middle-distance shots together with those made in the tank into a single frame.

Though much of the film was shot in the Hebrides, Livesey was not able to travel to Scotland because he was performing in a West End play, &quot;The Banbury Nose&quot; by Peter Ustinov, at the time of filming. Thus all his scenes were shot in the studio at Denham, and a double (coached by Livesey in London) was used in all of his scenes shot in Scotland. These were then mixed so that the same scene would often have a middle-distance shot of the double and then a closeup of Livesey, or a shot of the double&#x27;s back followed by a shot showing Livesey&#x27;s face.

The film was budgeted at £200,000 () and went £30,000 over. The actors received £50,000, of which one third went to Hiller. The whirlpool cost £40,000.

Powell shot a scene at the end of the film where Catriona follows Torquil into the castle, to emphasise her love for him, but decided to cut it.

===Music===
John Laurie was the choreographer and arranger for the cèilidh sequences. The puirt à beul &quot;Macaphee&quot; was performed by Boyd Steven, Maxwell Kennedy and Jean Houston of the Glasgow Orpheus Choir. The song sung at the cèilidh that Torquil translates for Joan is a traditional Gaelic song &quot;Ho ro, mo nighean donn bhòidheach&quot;, originally translated into English as &quot;Ho ro My Nut Brown Maiden&quot; by John Stuart Blackie in 1882. It is also played by three pipers marching toward Moy Castle at the start of the final scene. The film&#x27;s other music is traditional Scottish and Irish songs and original music by Allan Gray.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a hit at the box office and recovered its cost in the UK alone.

===U.S. release===
The film was one of the first five movies from the Rank Organisation to receive a release in the U.S. under a new arrangement. The others were &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;.

===Critical reviews===
Contemporary reviews were positive:

&quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The cast makes the best possible use of some natural, unforced dialogue, and there is some glorious outdoor photography.&quot; —, 14 November 1945

&quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;[It] has interest and integrity. It deserves to have successors.&quot; —, 16 November 1945

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote:

The great strength of this most entertaining film lies in its affectionate and sympathetic handling of the Highland setting: its great weakness lies in its story. The glimpses of Highland life, the dancing at the &quot;ceilidh&quot;, the gossip of travellers in a bus, the enthusiasm of the bird enthusiast (played by Captain Knight) with his eagle, all this is admirably done; and the storm, which is the climax of the film, is realistic and gripping. The story, however, does not bear reflective analysis. ...If the fundamental framework had been sound this could have been a first-rate film; it is in any case a piece of first-rate entertainment.
Raymond Chandler wrote in 1950, &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen a picture which smelled of the wind and rain in quite this way nor one which so beautifully exploited the kind of scenery people actually live with, rather than the kind which is commercialised as a show place.&quot; —, &quot;Letters&quot;.

Martin Scorsese wrote, &quot;I reached the point of thinking there were no more masterpieces to discover, until I saw &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot;&quot;

The film critic Barry Norman included it among his 100 greatest films of all time.

In 2012 the film critic Molly Haskell included it among her 10 greatest films of all time in that year&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll.

==Radio adaptation==
Hiller appeared in a radio adaptation of the film.

==Telephone box==
The red telephone box is now a Historic Environment Scotland Category B listed building.

<doc id="949860" wikidata="Q4793010" url="?curid=949860" title="Armed Forces Reserve Medal">
<text>The Armed Forces Reserve Medal (AFRM) is a service medal of the United States Armed Forces that has existed since 1958. The medal recognizes service performed by members of the reserve components and is awarded to both officers and enlisted personnel. The medal is considered a successor award to the Naval Reserve Medal and the Marine Corps Reserve Ribbon, which were discontinued in 1958 and 1965, respectively.

If the medal is awarded for periods of service, it is accompanied by an hourglass device. Depending on the length of service, a bronze, silver, gold, or bronze and gold hourglass are worn on the suspension ribbon and service ribbon, indicating 10, 20, 30, or 40 years of service, respectively.

If the medal is awarded in connection with a mobilization, it is accompanied by an &quot;M&quot; device. Subsequent mobilizations under an unrelated presidential call-up order result in a numeral device being worn to indicate the number of mobilizations.

==For service – the Hourglass device==
In the Army Reserve and National Guard, a service member qualifies for the medal after completing a total of ten years&#x27; service in the active reserve. This service may be cumulative, provided that the combined ten years of service was performed over a period of twelve consecutive years. Voluntary recalls to active duty are not counted within the ten years of service. In addition, unlike the Reserve Good Conduct Medal, a service member&#x27;s disciplinary history is not a factor when awarding the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. In the Navy Reserve, members of the Individual Ready Reserve are eligible for the medal after 10 years of service. Commissioned officers with reserve commissions serving on active duty for 10 years or longer are eligible for the Armed Forces Reserve Medal.

Periods of service for the Armed Forces Reserve Medal are denoted through the use of the hourglass device. The length of the period for which the Armed Forces Reserve Medal is awarded is indicated using a bronze hourglass, silver hourglass, gold hourglass, or bronze and gold hourglasses together. The initial presentation of the Armed Forces Reserve Medal is authorized with the bronze hourglass device denoting ten years of reserve service. At twenty years of service, the hourglass is upgraded to silver and at thirty years the hourglass becomes gold. For those who complete forty years of reserve service, a gold and bronze hourglass device are worn simultaneously. This is the only case where hourglasses are worn together; in all other cases the hourglass device is upgraded to the next higher award degree and is worn as a single device.

Prior to issued on August 6, 1996, a bronze hourglass device was presented only upon the second and subsequent awards of the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, as in a bronze hourglass for twenty years of service, two bronze hourglasses for thirty, and three bronze hourglasses for forty. Executive Order 13013 provided awarding a bronze hour glass after 10 years&#x27; service, a silver hourglass after 20 years of service and a gold hourglass after 30 years of service. Personnel discharged or retired, prior to the change of the Hourglass Device award criteria, are not eligible for a correction of records or an upgrade of the Hourglass Device, as the Hourglass Device would have originally been presented under the original award specifications.
==For mobilization – the &quot;M&quot; device==

The Armed Forces Reserve Medal is also awarded to any member of the Reserve or National Guard who is involuntarily mobilized for a contingency operation under Title 10 or Title 14, or volunteers for federal active duty during any such mobilization. In such cases, the medal with an &quot;M&quot; device (for mobilization) are both awarded together without regard to the period or length of service. The &quot;M&quot; device is a bronze &quot;M&quot; quarter of an inch in height.

Subsequent mobilizations for a different executive order call-up authorize a numeral device (&quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, etc.), sometimes called an award numeral, to be worn with the initial &quot;M&quot; device on the service ribbon and suspension ribbon of the medal. However, in the Army, multiple deployments for different operations during a call-up for the same executive order only qualify for a single award of the &quot;M&quot; device. For example, if a soldier mobilized multiple times under , once for Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and twice for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, the soldier would still only be awarded one &quot;M&quot; device despite having been mobilized three times.

If no &quot;M&quot; device is authorized, the appropriate hourglass shall be positioned in the center of the ribbon. If no hourglass is authorized, the &quot;M&quot; device shall be positioned in the center of the ribbon, followed by Arabic numerals indicating the number of times the device has been awarded (e.g., 2 to 99—no number is worn for the first award). If both the hourglass and the &quot;M&quot; device are awarded, the hourglass(es) shall be positioned in first position on the ribbon (at the wearer&#x27;s right), the &quot;M&quot; device in middle position, and the number of times the &quot;M&quot; device has been awarded in the remaining position (at the wearer&#x27;s left).

===Authorized Operation===
The table below lists designated U.S. military operations that have been approved for award of the &quot;M’ device on the AFRM under the provisions of Section 12301 of Title 10, U.S.C, provided the member meets other award criteria designated contained in DoDM 1348.33, Volume 2, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards: DoD Service Awards – Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Medals. The Military Departments are responsible for determining individual eligibility for the &quot;M&quot; device based on award criteria. Please refer individual eligibility questions to your respective Military Department.

<doc id="949872" wikidata="Q227650" url="?curid=949872" title="Zucchius (crater)">
<text>Zucchius is a prominent lunar impact crater located near the southwestern limb. Because of its location the crater appears oblong-shaped due to foreshortening. It lies just to the south-southwest of the crater Segner, and northeast of the much larger walled plain Bailly. To the southeast is Bettinus, a formation only slightly larger than Zucchius.

The crater rim is symmetrical and shows little significant wear from impacts. The inner wall is d, and there is a group of small central peaks that forms a curving arc around the middle of the floor, making it a complex crater. Due to its ray system, Zucchius is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

To the northeast of Zucchius is the Schiller-Zucchius Basin, a Pre-Nectarian peak ring basin. This basin has received the unofficial designation &#x27;Schiller Annular Plain&#x27; among lunar observers.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zucchius.

<doc id="949873" wikidata="Q1619359" url="?curid=949873" title="HAL HJT-36 Yashas">
<text>The HAL HJT-36 &quot;Yashas&quot; () is a subsonic intermediate jet trainer aircraft designed and developed by Aircraft Research and Design Centre (ARDC) and built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy. The HJT-36 will replace the HAL HJT-16 &quot;Kiran&quot; as the Stage-2 trainer for the two forces. 

The jet, originally named &quot;Sitara&quot;, was designed as a conventional jet trainer with low swept wings, tandem cockpit and small air intakes for the engine on either side of its fuselage. It entered limited series production by 2010 but according to the Indian Air Force officials it remained &quot;unfit&quot; for service due to technological issues related to spin test (as of March 2017), an issue which was only solved in tests in January 2022.

In April 2019, &quot;Sitara&quot; flew for the first time in three years with a modified air frame to correct its spin characteristics.

During the opening ceremony of Aero India 2025, the HJT-36 was renamed as &quot;Yashas&quot; after undergoing significant design modifications. It is now capable of Stage II pilot training, counter insurgency and counter surface force operations, armament training, aerobatics and other roles.

==Development==
HAL started design work on an intermediate jet trainer in 1997. The concept was developed as a successor to HAL&#x27;s earlier trainer, the HJT-16 &quot;Kiran&quot;, introduced in 1968. In 1999, following reviews by the Indian Air Force, the Government of India awarded HAL a contract for the development, testing, and certification of two prototype IJT aircraft at the cost of . The completion of the contract was scheduled in July 2004.
===2000s===
*The first and second prototypes of the HJT-36, labeled PT-1 and PT-2, serialed S3474 and S3466, flew on 7 March 2003 and in March 2004, respectively.
*In April 2005, the project cost was revised to and timeline for Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) and the Final Operational Clearance (FOC) was expected in 2006-07 and 2007-08, respectively.
*In April 2005, some delays were expected as the SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac engine was to be replaced by NPO Saturn AL-55I (16.9 kN) for higher thrust requirements.
*In February 2006, the Ministry of Defence submitted a proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) for procurement of 12 IJT Limited Series Production (LSP) aircraft from HAL. The clearance and the contract from the Indian Air Force was received in March 2006 at a cost of . Deliveries, originally scheduled between March 2008 and March 2010, was further revised to 2011-12. Later, a CAG report flagged that LSP orders are to be placed after IOC certification from CEMILAC, however, this was not followed in case of IJT project. It was then expected that the order of 73 Serial Production (SP) aircraft was to be done after conducting operations of LSP aircraft and certain required modifications to designs.
*On 8 February 2007, IJT prototype PT-1 overshot the runway at Yelehanka AFS during the inauguration of Aero India after its tyres burst during take-off.
*In November 2008, Air HQ initiated a proposal to for supply of 73 SP IJT aircraft from HAL.
*On 4 February 2009, PT-2 met with an accident just before the Aero India event due to landing gear failure while landing during a routine test flight.
*Following the crashes and delays, in March 2009, the IOC and FOC dates were shifted to 2009-10 and 2010-11, respectively.
*The first AL-55I engine was received from Russia on 28 December 2008, 2 years later than committed, and was installed on PT-1. Following ground taxiing trials, flight tests with the new engine started on 9 May 2009.

===2010s===
*In March 2010, the Air Force placed an order for 73 HJT-36 trainers for serial production at a cost of , again before the completion of IOC certification and deliveries of LSP aircraft. Clearance for the contract was approved by the CCS in February. As per MoD, the LSP aircraft order would be completed by 2011-12 and the timeline for delivery of 73 SP aircraft was between 2013 and 2017. As per delivery timeline, 6 aircraft would have to be delivered in 2013, followed by 24 aircraft in 2014 An advance payment of was done.
*The first flight test for the limited series aircraft occurred in January 2010, and initial operational capability was expected by July 2011.
*On 28 April 2011, the first prototype (S3466) crashed in near Hosur during routine test flight in Krishnagiri district, Tamil Nadu. Both the pilots, Group Captain Anant Mathur of HAL and co-pilot Wing Commander Patra of Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment (ASTE), ejected safely. The aircraft was lost in the accident.
*On 27 July 2012, first Engine Ground Run was performed on third prototype.
*In December 2013, HAL declared that Sitara was &#x27;weeks&#x27; from certification.
*On 19 February 2014, the Indian MoD submitted a statement that the development of IJT was in the advanced stages of certification, with more than 800 test flights completed so far. The activities were progressing well with completion of sea level trials, night flying trials, high altitude trials as well as weapon and drop tank trials. The activities left for obtaining Final Operational Clearance (FOC) are the refinement of stall characteristics, and spin testing which will be commenced as soon as stall characteristics were refined. All efforts were being made to achieve FOC by December 2014. Production of aircraft was to commence immediately thereafter. However the stall cannot be tested until HAL redesigns the entire aircraft to correct its &quot;inherent asymmetry&quot;.
*As of July 2014, 6 of the LSP aircraft were produced but still not delivered due to non completion of Design and Development (D&amp;D) activities.
*BAE Systems was consulted on certain design changes, specifically the tail. Afterwards the design was put to mathematical and wind tunnel tests. The modified aircraft was expected to complete the spin tests by September 2015, and the production of 85 aircraft for the Indian Air Force to begin.
*In 2016, the programme and the testing came to a halt after the aircraft “departed from controlled flight” while testing spin characteristics.
*In March 2017, Jane&#x27;s reported that due to the HJT-36&#x27;s &quot;unsolvable&quot; issues associated with critical stall and spin characteristics the aircraft is not ready to serve as an intermediate jet trainer for Indian Air Force pilots.
*With Birhle as a consultant, the air frame was modified to move the tailfin and tailplane further down which is expected to make spin recovery easier. The modified aircraft (IJT LSP4; S3854) flew for the first time on 17 April 2019. Post modifications, a new Anti-Spin Parachute system (ASPS) was developed to ensure safety of the aircraft and test crew during spin flight testing.

===2020s===
*As per a report, &quot;The new ASPS was integrated into the aircraft in July 2020 and the successful streaming of the parachutes were demonstrated in September 2020.&quot;
*In February 2021, HJT-36 took-off during Aero India with the newly supplied AL-55I engines with improved features.
*On 6 January, the IJT has successfully demonstrated the capability to carry out six turn spins to both the left and right hand sides. As of then, the aircraft would require more two years of testing, after which it would be ready for certification. With the help of internal funding, some major modifications were done in the design configuration and, hence, re-demonstration of earlier tests was required.
*In February 2025, at the Aero India 2025, HAL renamed the HJT-36 Sitara as the HJT-36 &#x27;Yashas&#x27;. The renaming was due to its design modification to correct &quot;departure characteristics and spin resistance&quot;. The aircraft was recently integrated with &quot;state-of-the-art avionics and an ultra-modern cockpit&quot;. This upgrades videos the overall weight of the aircraft and replaced the obsolete foreign line-replaceable units with Indian LRUs.
*On 12 February 2025, it was also reported that the Indian Air Force has not placed any order for the updated aircraft but would lease 4 to 5 &#x27;Yashas&#x27; from HAL. Further orders will be placed if the user was satisfied with its training and operational capabilities.
== Design ==

=== Airframe ===
HJT-36 uses light alloys and composites, with a conventional low wing design with 18° leading-edge sweepback and a 9.8m wingspan. It features a hydraulically retractable tricycle-type landing gear. The single-wheeled main units retract inward and the twin nose wheel unit retracts forward. About a quarter of the aircraft&#x27;s line-replaceable units are common between it and the HAL Tejas trainer variant.

=== Cockpit ===
In the cockpit, the HJT-36 has a conventional tandem two-seat configuration with the trainee pilot forward and the instructor in the raised seat to the rear. The single-piece canopy gives both pilots good, all-round vision. The prototype aircraft used Zvezda K-26LT lightweight zero-zero ejection seats. However, these may be replaced with Martin-Baker Mk.16 IN16S seats, due to a price escalation of the former. The pilots have both conventional and manual flight controls.

The trainer has a full glass cockpit with a layout similar to current generation combat aircraft. It uses an integrated digital avionics system from GE Aviation Systems. Head-up display and repeater is produced by Elbit Systems.

The cockpit features a Stepped-up Rear cockpit with a Drooped Nose enhancing the pilots&#x27; situational awareness. The aircraft also features multi-function displays and head-up display. .

=== Armaments ===
The aircraft has five external hardpoints for weapons training. There is one center-line hardpoint under the fuselage and two-weapon pylons under each wing for carrying rockets, gun pods, and bombs. The maximum external payload is 1,000 kg.

=== Propulsion ===

The aircraft features a FADEC-controlled NPO Saturn AL-55I with a thrust of 17.3 kN, providing a high thrust-to-weight ratio with optimised thrust management.

The prototype aircraft was initially powered by a SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac 04-H-20 non-afterburning turbofan developing 14.12 kN of thrust. However, as stipulated by the 2005 Air Staff Qualitative Requirements (ASQRs) from the Air Force there was a requirement of higher thrust engines.

In April 2005, the Larzac engine was to be replaced by NPO Saturn AL-55I (16.9 kN) to meet training requirements. The AL-55I engine would be a Joint Venture of HAL and NPO Saturn and the deal for the development of the same was signed with Rosoboronexport in August. A funding of by the Indian Ministry of Defence was released for the higher thrust engine development.

As per a CAG report on IJT, in February 2014, the engine developed (AL-55I) had a Total Technical Life (TTL) of only 300 hours against the required 3600 hours provided in the ASQR. However, by 2013, it was told that the contract for engine development was fulfilled and the JV intended to increase the TTL to 600 hours though IAF insisted a TTL of 1,200 hours. The increase of TTL was important as ASQR projected a &quot;utilisation rate&quot; of 30 hrs/month per aircraft which meant the engines needed to be replaced every 10 months.

On 14 July 2021, it was reported that the United Engine Corporation had deliver two units of AL-55I engines to HAL for the HJT-36 programme. The life cycle of the improved engines were increased to 1,200 hours . Earlier, 16 engines had been supplied to HAL for the prototypes and limited series production (LSP) aircraft. The engines were reportedly ready for licenced production in India. The new engines also had an improved thrust of 17.27 kN and also featured a reduction of over 50 kg weight.

By February 2025, UEC supplied 18 AL-55I engines to HAL for the project. The engines will undergo type ceetification followed by start of licensed production of the engines by HAL in India.

<text>The Taipei Basin () is a geographic region in northern Taiwan. It is the largest basin in Taiwan. The basin is bounded by the Yangmingshan to the north, the Linkou Plateau to the west, and the Ridge of Xueshan Range to the southeast. The shape of the basin is close to a triangle. The three vertices are Nangang, Huilong of Xinzhuang, and Guandu of Beitou.

The main rivers in the Taipei Basin include the Tamsui, Keelung, Dahan and Xindian.

In the prehistoric era, the Taipei Basin was home to Ketagalan tribes. Han Chinese did not settle in the region until the 18th century. Today, Taipei Basin is within the boundaries of Taipei City and New Taipei City and is the largest metropolitan area in Taiwan.

==Geology==
The Taipei Basin is a subsiding half-graben.

== Pollution ==
The Taipei Basin rivers are heavily polluted by both raw sewage and industrial pollution from illegal industry. The natural river restoration is on the agenda of the Taipei City Government and several citizen organizations.

<doc id="949880" wikidata="Q725503" url="?curid=949880" title="Long and short scales">
<text>The long and short scales are two powers of ten number naming systems that are consistent with each other for smaller numbers, but are contradictory for larger numbers. Other numbering systems, particularly in East Asia and South Asia, have large number naming that differs from both the long and short scales. Such numbering systems include the Indian numbering system and Chinese, Japanese, and Korean numerals. Much of the remainder of the world adopted either the short or long scale. Countries using the long scale include most countries in continental Europe and most that are French-speaking, German-speaking and Spanish-speaking. Use of the short scale is found in most English and Arabic speaking countries and Brazil.

For powers of ten less than 9 (one, ten, hundred, thousand and million) the short and long scales are identical, but for larger powers of ten, the two systems differ in confusing ways. For identical names, the long scale grows by multiples of one million (106), whereas the short scale grows by multiples of one thousand (103). For example, the short scale &quot;billion&quot; is one thousand million (109), whereas in the long scale, &quot;billion&quot; is one million million (1012). The long scale system includes additional names for interleaved values, typically replacing the word ending &quot;-ion&quot; by &quot;-iard&quot;.

To avoid confusion, the International System of Units (SI) recommends using the metric prefixes to indicate magnitude.
For example giga is always 109, which is billion in short scale but milliard in long scale.

==Definition==
In both scales, names are given to orders of magnitude at increments of 1000. Both systems use the same names for magnitudes less than 109. Differences arise from the use of identical names for larger magnitudes. For the same magnitude name (&quot;n&quot;-illion), the value is 103&quot;n&quot;+3 in the short scale but 106&quot;n&quot; in the long scale for positive integers &quot;n&quot;.

In some languages, the long scale uses additional names for the intermediate multipliers, replacing the ending &quot;-ion&quot; with &quot;-iard&quot;; for example, the next multiplier after &quot;million&quot; is &quot;milliard&quot; (109); after a &quot;billion&quot; it is &quot;billiard&quot; (1015). Hence, a long scale &quot;n&quot;-illiard equals 106&quot;n&quot;+3.

The following table shows the size of first few short and long scale magnitudes. Notice how billion and trillion are in both scales but have different sizes.

==Comparison==
The following tables shows corresponding names and values of the two scales.

Note that instead of using an intermediate long scale word (illiard), a quantity is sometimes specified in terms of the smaller illion word. For example, &quot;thousand billion&quot; instead of &quot;billiard&quot;.

The different sizes of the same names of the two scales can be described as:

==Avoiding confusion==

One way to avoid confusion between the two scales is to use positional notation. For example 1,000,000,000,000 rather than 1 trillion (short scale) or 1 billion (long scale). This method becomes unwieldy for very large numbers.

Combinations of the unambiguous words such as ten, hundred, thousand and million. For example: one thousand million and one million million.

Scientific notation (for example 1), or its engineering notation variant (for example 10), or the computing variant E notation (for example codice_1). This is the most common practice among scientists and mathematicians.

SI metric prefixes. For example, giga for 109 and tera for 1012 can give gigawatt (109 W) and terawatt (1012 W). Use with non-SI units is unambiguous. For example, giga-dollars, megabucks, k€ and M€.

==History==
Although this situation has been developing since the 1200s, the first recorded use of the terms &quot;short scale&quot; () and &quot;long scale&quot; () was by the French mathematician Geneviève Guitel in 1975.

The short scale was never widespread before its general adoption in the United States. It has been taught in American schools since the early 1800s. It has since become common in other English-speaking nations and several other countries. For most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely used the long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the two systems were often referred to as &quot;British&quot; and &quot;American&quot; in the English language. After several decades of increasing informal British usage of the short scale, in 1974 the government of the UK adopted it, and it is used for all official purposes. The British usage and American usage are now identical.

The existence of the different scales means that care must be taken when comparing large numbers between languages or countries, or when interpreting old documents in countries where the dominant scale has changed over time. For example, British English, French, and Italian historical documents can refer to either the short or long scale, depending on the date of the document, since each of the three countries has used both systems at various times in its history. Today, the United Kingdom officially uses the short scale, but France and Italy use the long scale.

The pre-1974 former British English word &quot;billion&quot;, post-1961 current French word &quot;billion&quot;, post-1994 current Italian word &quot;bilione&quot;, Spanish &quot;billón&quot;, German &quot;Billion&quot;, Dutch &quot;biljoen&quot;, Danish &quot;billion&quot;, Swedish &quot;biljon&quot;, Finnish &quot;biljoona&quot;, Slovenian &quot;bilijon&quot;, Polish &quot;bilion&quot;, and European Portuguese word &quot;bilião&quot; (with a different spelling to the Brazilian Portuguese variant, but in Brazil referring to short scale) all refer to 1012, being long-scale terms. Therefore, each of these words translates to the American English or post-1974 British English word: &quot;trillion&quot; (1012 in the short scale), and not &quot;billion&quot; (109 in the short scale).

On the other hand, the pre-1961 former French word &quot;billion&quot;, pre-1994 former Italian word &quot;bilione&quot;, Brazilian Portuguese word &quot;bilhão&quot;, and Welsh word &quot;biliwn&quot; all refer to 109, being short scale terms. Each of these words translates to the American English or post-1974 British English word &quot;billion&quot; (109 in the short scale).

The term &quot;billion&quot; originally meant 1012 when introduced. In long scale countries, &quot;milliard&quot; was defined to its current value of 109, leaving &quot;billion&quot; at its original 1012 value and so on for the larger numbers. Some of these countries, but not all, introduced new words &quot;billiard&quot;, &quot;trilliard&quot;, etc. as intermediate terms. In some short scale countries, &quot;milliard&quot; was defined to 109 and &quot;billion&quot; dropped altogether, with &quot;trillion&quot; redefined down to 1012 and so on for the larger numbers. In many short scale countries, &quot;milliard&quot; was dropped altogether and &quot;billion&quot; was redefined down to 109, adjusting downwards the value of &quot;trillion&quot; and all the larger numbers.

The root &quot;mil&quot; in &quot;million&quot; does not refer to the numeral, &quot;1&quot;. The word, &quot;million&quot;, derives from the Old French, &quot;milion&quot;, from the earlier Old Italian, &quot;milione&quot;, an intensification of the Latin word, &quot;mille&quot;, a thousand. That is, a &quot;million&quot; is a &quot;big thousand&quot;, much as a &quot;great gross&quot; is a dozen gross or 12 × 144 = 1728.

The word &quot;milliard&quot;, or its translation, is found in many European languages and is used in those languages for 109. However, it is not found in American English, which uses &quot;billion&quot;, and not used in British English, which preferred to use &quot;thousand million&quot; before the current usage of &quot;billion&quot;. The financial term &quot;yard&quot;, which derives from &quot;milliard&quot;, is used on financial markets, as, unlike the term &quot;billion&quot;, it is internationally unambiguous and phonetically distinct from &quot;million&quot;. Likewise, many long scale countries use the word &quot;billiard&quot; (or similar) for one thousand long scale billions (i.e., 1015), and the word &quot;trilliard&quot; (or similar) for one thousand long scale trillions (i.e., 1021), etc.

==Current usage==
===Short scale users===
====English-speaking====
Most English-language countries and regions use the short scale with 109 being &quot;billion&quot;. For example:
* 
* (English-speaking) &quot;see&quot; Using both &quot;below&quot;
* (English-speaking, , &quot;trilliún&quot;)
* 
====Arabic-speaking====
Most Arabic-language countries and regions use the short scale with 109 being , except for a few countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE which use the word بليون for 109. For example:
* 
* 
* 


====Other short scale====
Other countries also use a word similar to &quot;trillion&quot; to mean 1012, etc. Whilst a few of these countries like English use a word similar to &quot;billion&quot; to mean 109, most like Arabic have kept a traditionally long scale word similar to &quot;milliard&quot; for 109. Some examples of short scale use, and the words used for 109 and 1012, are
* (Brazilian Portuguese: , )
* (Hebrew: , )
* (, )
===Long scale users===
The long scale is used by most Continental European countries and by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to &quot;billion&quot; to mean 1012. Some use a word similar to &quot;milliard&quot; to mean 109, while others use a word or phrase equivalent to &quot;thousand millions&quot;.

====Dutch-speaking====

<text>A borough (also spelled boro), in the context of local government in the U.S. state of New Jersey, refers to one of five &quot;types&quot; and one of eleven &quot;forms&quot; of municipal government (in addition to those established under a special charter).

Among New Jersey&#x27;s 564 municipalities, the borough is the most common form of local government, though the majority of state residents actually reside in townships. In 2023 there were 253 boroughs in New Jersey.
However, boroughs were not always so common. In 1875 only 17 boroughs had been created, all by special acts of the legislature. These original boroughs were &quot;subdivisions&quot; of townships, established by state charter; Elizabeth was the first, established by royal charter in 1740, within the now defunct Elizabeth Township. About half of them had been dissolved, or changed into other forms of government—often cities. In 1875, a constitutional amendment prohibited such local or special legislation. Bergen County is home to the highest number of boroughs of any New Jersey county, at 56.

==Legislation==
The Borough Act of 1878 allowed any township (or portion thereof) with a land area of no more than and a population not exceeding 5,000, to establish itself as an independent borough through a petition and referendum process on a self-executing basis. As enacted, a borough would be governed by an elected mayor (serving a one-year term) and a six-member council (elected to staggered three-year terms). The mayor would preside at council meetings, but had no vote except to break ties. This system resulted in a period, known as &quot;boroughitis&quot;, where large numbers of small boroughs were created. In 1894, the Legislature passed an act requiring each township to have a single school district. A wave of borough incorporations followed, as one part of several townships decided that it would prefer the cost of being a separate municipality to paying for the other schools.

The Borough Act of 1897 amended the original Act, eliminating the self-executing incorporation feature of the earlier legislation. Henceforth, newly incorporated boroughs (or those seeking to dissolve or increase or decrease in size) required approval of the legislature. The elected mayor and six-member council were retained, with the mayor now serving a two-year term.

The Borough Act of 1987 was created to streamline borough law and clear away amendments, changes, and contradictory rules that had accumulated over the century of the Borough&#x27;s existence as a form of government. The 1987 Act allowed for the delegation of executive responsibility to an appointed administrator.

====Borough government====
Traditionally, voters elect a mayor and six council members at-large in a partisan election. Only two boroughs, Roselle and Roselle Park, have ward structures with councils having five ward members and one at-large. The borough system has a weak mayor and the council performs most legislative and executive functions. This form of local government is used by 39% of the municipalities in New Jersey.

<doc id="949890" wikidata="Q230257" url="?curid=949890" title="Zupus (crater)">
<text>Zupus is the lava-flooded remains of a lunar impact crater. It is located on a southwestern reach of the Oceanus Procellarum, to the northwest of Mare Humorum. To the north-northeast is the flooded crater Billy, and some distance to the southeast is Mersenius. A system of faint rilles named the Rimae Zupus lie to the northwest, following a course to the north-northwest towards the mare.

Little remains of the original formation, and the rim is low and irregular in outline, giving the feature the appearance of a valley. This rim climbs to a maximum height of 1.3 km above the base. The crater Zupus S intrudes upon the eastern rim. A faint ghost crater lies in the mare to the northeast. The mare covering the floor of Zupus is darker in hue than the surrounding terrain, making the feature relatively easy for an observer to locate.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Zupus.

<doc id="949894" wikidata="Q1319139" url="?curid=949894" title="Kung-Fu Master (video game)">
<text>Kung-Fu Master, known as in Japan, is a 1984 beat &#x27;em up game developed and published by Irem for arcades. It was distributed by Data East in North America. Designed by Takashi Nishiyama, the game was based on Hong Kong martial arts films. It is a loose adaptation of the Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao film &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984), called &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan, with the protagonist Thomas named after Jackie Chan&#x27;s character in the film. The game is also heavily inspired by the Bruce Lee film &quot;Game of Death&quot; (1972), which was the basis for the game&#x27;s concept. Nishiyama, who had previously designed the side-scrolling shooter &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; (1982), combined fighting elements with a shoot &#x27;em up gameplay rhythm. Irem and Data East exported the game to the West without the &quot;Spartan X&quot; license.

The player controls Thomas, a kung fu master, as he fights his way through the five levels of the Devil&#x27;s Temple to rescue his girlfriend Sylvia from the crime boss Mr. X. As he ascends the tower, he has to fight many enemies along the way and five end-of-level boss battles, a concept inspired by &quot;Game of Death&quot;. Thomas and each boss have a health meter, and the game temporarily becomes a one-on-one fighting game during boss battles.

The game was a major commercial success, topping the Japanese arcade charts and becoming America&#x27;s second highest-grossing arcade game of 1985, while receiving critical acclaim for its fast-paced, side-scrolling gameplay and detailed, colorful graphics. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the Famicom in Japan) was developed by Nintendo under the direction of Shigeru Miyamoto, released as &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan and Kung Fu in the West, selling 3.5 million copies worldwide. It was also one of the top five best-selling Commodore 64 games of 1986. It spawned the sequel &quot;Spartan X 2&quot; (1991) and the spiritual successors &quot;Trojan&quot; (1986) and &quot;Vigilante&quot; (1988).

&quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; was a highly influential game. It is regarded as the first beat &#x27;em up video game, and an early example of the side-scrolling character action game genre, which became popular during the mid-to-late 1980s. Miyamoto&#x27;s work on the NES port inspired his development of the side-scrolling platform game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), while Nishiyama was hired by Capcom where he used the game&#x27;s boss battles as the basis for the fighting game &quot;Street Fighter&quot; (1987), before working for SNK on fighting games such as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; also influenced other media, such as the Red Ribbon Army saga (1985–1986) of the manga and anime series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, as well as the French film &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; (1988).

==Gameplay==
The player controls Thomas with an eight-way joystick and two attack buttons to punch and kick. Unlike more conventional side-scrolling games, the joystick is used not only to crouch, but also to jump. Punches and kicks can be performed from a standing, crouching or jumping position. Punches award more points than kicks and do more damage, but their range is shorter. Thomas has a health meter indicating how much damage he can take. He can absorb a significant amount of damage, but loses a life if he takes too many hits.

Underlings encountered by the player include Grippers, who can grab Thomas and drain his energy until shaken off; Knife Throwers, who can throw at two different heights and must be hit twice; and Tom Toms, short fighters who can either grab Thomas or somersault to strike his head when he is crouching. On even-numbered floors, the player must also deal with falling balls and pots, snakes, poisonous moths, fire-breathing dragons, and exploding confetti balls.

The Devil&#x27;s Temple has five floors, each ending with a different boss (described as &quot;sons of the devil&quot; at the start of the game). Each boss has a health meter like Thomas, which leads to the game temporarily becoming a one-on-one fighting game during a boss battle. In order to complete a floor, Thomas must connect enough strikes to completely drain the boss&#x27;s energy meter; he can then climb the stairs to the next floor. Thomas has a fixed time limit to complete each floor; if time runs out or his meter is completely drained, the player loses one life and must replay the entire floor. Upon completing a floor, the player receives bonus points for remaining time and energy.

The bosses of the first four levels are Stick Fighter, Boomerang Fighter, Giant, and Black Magician. The boss of the fifth floor is Mr. X, the leader of the gang that kidnapped Sylvia. Once he is defeated, Thomas rescues Sylvia and the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.

An extra life is given at 50,000 points; thereafter, the rest of the game is on &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mode. Play continues until the last Thomas is dead, which ends the game.

==Development==
The game was designed for Irem by Takashi Nishiyama. &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; is based on Hong Kong martial arts films. It is a loose adaptation of the Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao film &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; (1984), called &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan, specifically the final part of the film which involves Thomas (Jackie Chan) climbing a Spanish castle to rescue Sylvia (Lola Forner), with the help of Moby (Sammo Hung) and his cousin David (Yuen Biao). The game also borrows heavily from Bruce Lee&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Game of Death&quot;, with the five-level Devil&#x27;s Temple reflecting the movie&#x27;s setting of a five-level pagoda with a martial arts master in each level; in contrast, &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; takes place in Spain as opposed to the game&#x27;s East Asian setting. The final part of &quot;Wheels on Meals&quot; had itself borrowed its concept of climbing an enemy base by fighting enemies along the way from &quot;Game of Death&quot;. The game was also influenced by the Bruce Lee film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; (1973).

Nishiyama had earlier created Irem&#x27;s 1982 arcade side-scrolling shooter game &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;. Nishiyama designed &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; by combining a shoot &#x27;em up gameplay rhythm with fighting elements.

The music and sound for the arcade game were composed by Masato Ishizaki. Nishiyama initially believed the game did not need any music, as it was a martial arts game and he thought it would sound more impressive to just have the sound effects. Ishizaki had a melody in mind for the game, leading him to suggest that two versions be made, with and without the music, and asked to see which sounded better. After hearing both versions, Nishiyama agreed that the music version sounded better and included Ishizaki&#x27;s melody in the game.

Prior to the game&#x27;s development, Nishiyama was invited to join Capcom by its founder Kenzo Tsujimoto in 1983, after he had left Irem. Nishiyama decided to remain in Irem up until the development of &quot;Spartan X&quot;. He eventually decided to leave Irem and join Capcom before the game was complete. Ishizaki later went on to compose the music and sound for &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987).

==Release==
The arcade game was originally released as &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan, on November 24, 1984. It was then released internationally as &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, in North America during late 1984 and in Europe by early 1985.

==Ports==
In June 1985, the game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, known as the Famicom in Japan. It was released as &quot;Spartan X&quot; in Japan, before releasing internationally as &quot;Kung Fu&quot; in North America and PAL regions. The game was converted and published by Nintendo, with the port designed and directed by Shigeru Miyamoto. He led the Nintendo development team responsible for porting the Famicom port. He was interested in porting &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; due to its side-scrolling action gameplay, which was something he had in mind for the platformer genre, so he wanted to gain experience developing side-scrolling games with &quot;Excitebike&quot; (1984) and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Koji Kondo also worked on the Famicom port, designing the sound effects. In the NES version, Thomas is closely modelled after Jackie Chan, making it the first video game to feature a real-life person.

The game was ported to the Atari 2600 by programmer Dan Kitchen (brother of Garry Kitchen), shortly after he had ported &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) to the Atari 2600. This port of &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; is considered a significant programming feat considering the technical limitations of the Atari 2600.

&quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; was also ported to the Atari 7800, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Commodore 64, MSX (Irem/ASCII version as &quot;Seiken Achō&quot;), PlayChoice-10 (arcade, nearly the same as the NES version), and ZX Spectrum.

== Reception ==
===Arcade===
In Japan, the &quot;Game Machine&quot; arcade charts listed &quot;Spartan X&quot; as the top-grossing table arcade cabinet for two months in 1984, from January 15 through February 1984. It regained popularity in Japanese arcades following the release of the Famicom port later that year. In Europe, it was a major arcade hit in 1985.

In North America, it was a major hit in arcades, reaching number-one on the US arcade earnings charts upon release, and selling 5,000 arcade cabinets by April 1985. It was later the second top-grossing upright arcade cabinet on the &quot;RePlay&quot; charts in November 1985 (just below Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot;). It ended the year as America&#x27;s second highest-grossing arcade game of 1985, below the Data East fighting game &quot;Karate Champ&quot;. &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; was later also America&#x27;s eleventh highest-grossing arcade game of 1986, according to the annual &quot;RePlay&quot; chart.

Claire Edgley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; gave the arcade game a positive review in March 1985. She was positively surprised by the &quot;hard-hitting&quot; action, the &quot;very fast&quot; and &quot;breath-taking&quot; pace, and large number of enemies. She also praised the controls, referring to Thomas as &quot;a whirling, kicking, jumping, fighting machine&quot; controlled by an eight-way joystick and two buttons, the &quot;energy levels&quot; which allow the player to &quot;absorb a large number of hits&quot; from enemies, the smooth &quot;lifelike&quot; picturesque graphics, and the catchy music jingles. She concluded that if &quot;you thought that &quot;Karate Champ&quot; was good — wait &#x27;til you try this one!&quot;

Mike Roberts also gave the arcade game a positive review in the May 1985 issue of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot;. He noted it was part of the &quot;current craze&quot; for arcade martial arts games, but said it had &quot;more of a story line and game play&quot; than others, noting the progression through five floors, simplified controls, abilities such as ducking and jumping, and multiple &quot;standard baddies&quot; followed by &quot;super baddies&quot; who are tougher to beat; he refers to the final opponent as the boss of organization X. Matt Fox later reviewed the arcade game in 2013, praising the gameplay, animation and innovation.

===Ports===
In Japan, the Famicom version sold 1.42 million copies. In North America, the NES version titled &quot;Kung Fu&quot; was the top-selling video game in the United States during July 1986, and again in September. The NES version went on to sell 3.5 million copies worldwide. In Europe, the Commodore 64 port topped the UK Gallup software sales charts in February 1986, and went on to become one of the top five best-selling Commodore 64 games of 1986. The ZX Spectrum version also sold well.

&quot;Top Score&quot; reviewed the NES version in early 1987, calling it &quot;a fantastic reproduction of its arcade counterpart&quot; and an action-packed winner. Tony Takoushi of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; called it &quot;a near perfect conversion with all the gameplay and levels&quot; intact from the arcade original, praising the gameplay as well as the &quot;solid&quot; graphics and sound. In 2017, IGN ranked the NES port at number 62 on its list of top 100 NES games. They said that, despite being a &quot;dumbed-down port&quot; compared to the arcade original, it was a fun game with rewarding gameplay, challenging boss battles and replay value.

&quot;Commodore User&quot; gave the Commodore 64 version a positive review in February 1986. Rick Teverbaugh reviewed the Commodore and Apple versions for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1986. He called it &quot;a karate game with adventure elements thrown in&quot; and said that it looked better on the Commodore than on the Apple.

==Legacy==
The arcade version was later included along with the arcade versions of &quot;10-Yard Fight&quot; and &quot;Zippy Race&quot; in IAC/Irem Arcade Classics for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, released in Japan only in 1996 by Irem and I&#x27;Max. The arcade version was released to cell phones.

The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the game were included on the 1986 compilation &quot;They Sold a Million 3&quot;, along with &quot;Fighter Pilot&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and &quot;Rambo.

===Sequels and successors===
&quot;Dragon Wang&quot; is an action game made by Sega for the SG-1000 released in 1985 and was inspired by &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;. The protagonist is Wang (inspired by Jackie Chan and/or his character Thomas) whose name means &quot;King&quot; in Chinese.

&quot;My Hero&quot; was released by Sega for arcades in 1985 and for the Master System on January 1, 1986. The gameplay format is similar to Irem&#x27;s &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;.

&quot;Lady Master&quot; (レディーマスター, Redī Masutā) shortened from &quot;Lady Master of Kung Fu&quot; and known as &quot;Nunchackun&quot; in the US, is 2D side-scrolling fighting game developed by Taito and published by Magic Electronics in 1985 for arcades. Players control a character simply known as Lady (レディ), a female martial artist skilled in kung-fu using kicks and leg sweeps and wields nunchaku as a primary weapon. Gameplay can be best described as a combination between its inspiration &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; and Taito&#x27;s earlier title &quot;Elevator Action&quot;. Lady fights a multitude of many different enemies inside a large mansion featuring several floors that she uses elevators to travel in between. Some rooms on some floors are open allowing her to enter them with each possibly containing items, letters that can be collected for a stage end bonus, or more difficult enemies. These enemies may provide powerups when defeated. A room on the top floor of the mansion contains a stage boss. The game also features an alternating two-player mode. This game is one of the earlier titles to feature a playable female protagonist.

After designing &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, Takashi Nishiyama was later hired by Capcom. He designed an arcade successor for Capcom, &quot;Trojan&quot; (1986), which evolved the basic gameplay concepts of &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;. The NES port included a one-on-one fighting mode, a precursor to Nishiyama&#x27;s work on &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

&quot;Kung Fu Kid&quot;, known in Japan as &quot;Makai Retsuden&quot; (魔界列伝), is a Master System video game released in 1987. It is the follow-up to the Sega SG-1000 title &quot;Dragon Wang&quot; with both titles playing very closely to &quot;Spartan X&quot;.

Originally in 1985, Irem began work on the prototype &quot;Super Kung-Fu Master&quot; which later expanded the work into an arcade sequel called &quot;Beyond Kung-Fu: Return of the Master&quot; under development and underwent location testing in 1987, but was shelved after it underperformed. &quot;Beyond Kung-Fu&quot; was then revamped into &quot;Vigilante&quot;, after Irem decided to give the game a more Americanized setting, which was released in 1988.

In 1990, the arcade game received a Game Boy sequel of the same name(s) as the 1984 original, which has similar gameplay to the arcade game, but with a completely different plot and setting with a new protagonist named &quot;Bruce Leap&quot; in the releases outside of Japan.

In 1991, a sequel was released in Japan for the Famicom, titled &quot;Spartan X 2&quot;. It was originally planned to release in North America as &quot;Kung Fu II&quot; in the fall of 1991, but ended up not releasing there. &quot;Spartan X 2&quot; did not receive a North American release until 2016, when it was included as a built-in title for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console under the name &quot;Kung-Fu Master 2&quot;.

Indie publisher and developer Toushiryoku Laboratory (闘志力研究所) released doujin games &quot;Tifa Tan X&quot; (TifaTan X, ティファタンX) in 2004 and its sequel &quot;Tifa Tan X2&quot; (TifaTan X 2, ティファタンX2) in 2005 as light-hearted homages and ecchi style parodies of &quot;Spartan X&quot; for PC and stars Tifa Lockhart from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as a playable character. Inspired heavily from &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, gameplay is similar across both titles with the second seeing improvement to overall gameplay, graphics, and sound. The second game also features other characters making cameos from other games as boss fights those being Lilith from &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;, Mai Shiranui from &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, Princess Athena from her own game, Abobo from &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, and a male Red Mage from the original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; who is the main antagonist.

On December 26, 2019, developer PiXEL released their doujin game &quot;Xiaomei and the Flame Dragon&#x27;s Fist&quot; (焔龍聖拳シャオメイ, Fire Dragon Master Fist Xiaomei) for PC through DLsite and was later ported to the Nintendo Switch by publisher Leoful on March 31, 2023 as a digital only release. The game pays homage mainly to the original &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; in terms of its hud, level layout, and overall game structure although the title includes other elements from other games of its type during the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. The plot features heroine Xiaomei, who embarks on a journey to save her older sister, Xiaoyin, from the evil influence of the Dark Dragon. The Switch version also comes with a new story from Xiaoyin&#x27;s perspective in Xiaoyin Mode (after completing the main story), with new characters, and unlockables such as wallpapers and character illustrations. Players fight enemies on a single plane from left to right to reach and fight a boss at the end of each stage with a variety of moves including simple and kicks to jumping attacks along with more advanced moves such as a powerful downward strike and short ranged attacks among others. Moves can also be strung together into combos for extra damage and points. While fighting, item pickups can be available to restore health and augment the player&#x27;s attacks. Enemies include the classic Gripper types that swarm and immobilize the player and begins draining their health until the player dies along with flying birds and dragons attacking them from above among other enemy types. Former Namco composer Norio Nakagata was brought onboard along with one-time Sega sound designer Hirofumi Murasaki to do the game&#x27;s music and sound effects. The game&#x27;s illustrations and graphics are by Studio Vigor and character voices by Suika.

==Impact==
===Beat &#x27;em up and fighting games===
&quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; is regarded as the first beat &#x27;em up video game (also referred to as brawlers) in the world. According to &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; invented the genre. It distinguished itself from &quot;Karate Champ&quot; by simplifying the combat system and featuring multiple opponents along a side-scrolling playfield. It established the &quot;walk forward and beat up dudes&quot; trend that influenced many games after it. It also established the end-of-level boss battle structure used in the beat &#x27;em up genre, with the player character progressing through levels and fighting a boss character at the end of each level; in turn, this end-of-level boss battle structure was adapted from the Bruce Lee film &quot;Game of Death&quot;, where Lee&#x27;s character fights a different boss character on each floor as he ascends a pagoda.

According to Matt Fox, it &quot;one hundred percent defined&quot; the beat &#x27;em up genre, with variations of its plot structure used in virtually every scrolling beat &#x27;em up since. There were numerous imitators, such as &quot;Black Belt&quot; (1986) and &quot;Kung Fu Kid&quot; (1987) on the Master System. Other beat &#x27;em ups that followed its single-plane side-scrolling format include arcade games such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;My Hero&quot; and &quot;Flashgal&quot; (1985), Taito&#x27;s &quot;The Ninja Warriors&quot; (1987), Data East&#x27;s &quot;Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja&quot; (1988) and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Splatterhouse&quot; (1988). Other titles such as Technōs Japan&#x27;s &quot;Renegade&quot; (1986) and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; (1987), Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Final Fight&quot; (1989) and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Streets of Rage&quot; (1991) evolved the beat &#x27;em up formula established by &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; with a belt-scrolling format.

The boss battles had health meters for the player character and each boss, which led to the game temporarily becoming a one-on-one fighting game during boss battles. The &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; boss battles became the basis for the 1987 fighting game &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, which was directed by &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; designer Takashi Nishiyama after leaving Irem for Capcom. Following the release of &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;, Capcom was interested in hiring Nishiyama, who then led the development of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Nishiyama later left Capcom to run SNK&#x27;s video game development division, creating the Neo Geo arcade system board and fighting games including &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;.

===Side-scrolling character action games===
&quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; was an early example of a side-scrolling character action game, a genre of games that featured large sprite characters in colorful, side-scrolling environments, with the core gameplay consisting of fighting large groups of weaker enemies using attacks (or weapons) such as punches, kicks, guns, swords, ninjutsu or magic. More arcade side-scrollers followed during the mid-to-late 1980s, including ninja games such as Taito&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; (1985), Sega&#x27;s &quot;Shinobi&quot; (1987), and Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (1988) as well as run and gun video games such as Konami&#x27;s Rush&#x27;n Attack and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1986). &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; was the first side-scrolling martial arts action game, serving as the prototype for most martial arts games during the late 1980s, and also established the health meter mechanic as a standard feature in fighting games and side-scrolling action games such as beat &#x27;em ups. Jamie Lendino also notes that, unlike &quot;most arcade games&quot; which had emphasized high scores and lives, &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; &quot;had a genuine narrative arc&quot; with a beginning, middle and end.

The game&#x27;s side-scrolling action gameplay played a key role in the development of Nintendo&#x27;s influential side-scrolling platform game &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985), developed by the same Nintendo team behind the NES port &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. Shigeru Miyamoto cited his development of the Famicom port as one of the key factors behind his creation of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; According to Miyamoto, the concept of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; came about as a result of the &quot;technical know-how&quot; built up from &quot;Excitebike&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, his work on which inspired him to come up with a game that would have the player &quot;strategize while scrolling sideways&quot; over long distances, have aboveground and underground levels, and have colorful backgrounds rather than black backgrounds, resulting in the creation of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;

&quot;Kung Fu&quot; was one of the first NES titles that originated from a third-party developer, giving it a &quot;special place&quot; in the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System according to IGN. &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; also influenced the combat system of &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; (1987).

===Popular culture===
Akira Toriyama cited the Famicom version of &quot;Spartan X&quot; as an inspiration for a major saga in the manga and anime series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;: the Red Ribbon Army saga (1985-1986), specifically the Muscle Tower arc, which involves Goku ascending an enemy base and fighting enemies on each floor. This arc was a turning point for &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, a departure from the tournament format of the previous saga. Tooru Fujisawa, creator of manga and anime series &quot;Great Teacher Onizuka&quot; (&quot;GTO&quot;), is also a fan of &quot;Spartan X&quot;.

The game also influenced a French film called &quot;Kung Fu Master&quot; (1988) directed by Agnès Varda. Despite the title, it is not an adaptation of the game, nor is it a martial arts film, but it is rather a drama film concerning a divorced mother falling in love with a 14 year-old video game player. The film showcases various arcade games, with the character&#x27;s interest in the &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; arcade game being a central plot device.

<text>Phillip Dennis Ivey Jr. (born February 1, 1977) is an American professional poker player who has won eleven World Series of Poker bracelets, one World Poker Tour title, and appeared at nine World Poker Tour final tables. Ivey is regarded by numerous poker observers and contemporaries as the best all-around player in the world. In 2017, he was elected to the Poker Hall of Fame.

== Background ==
Ivey first began to develop his poker skills by playing against co-workers at a New Brunswick, New Jersey, telemarketing firm in the late 1990s. He was introduced to the game by playing five-card stud with his grandfather as a child. One of his nicknames, &quot;No Home Jerome&quot;, stems from the fake ID card he secured to play poker in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in his teenage years. He was given the nickname &quot;The Phenom&quot;. His other nickname is &quot;the Tiger Woods of Poker&quot;.

====World Series of Poker====
Ivey&#x27;s first breakthrough at the WSOP came in 2000, when he won a Pot Limit Omaha event for his first career bracelet. In winning the tournament, Ivey was the first person to defeat Amarillo Slim heads-up at a WSOP final table. Ivey&#x27;s tournament accomplishments include winning three bracelets at the 2002 World Series of Poker, tying Phil Hellmuth Jr, Ted Forrest, and Puggy Pearson for most World Series tournament wins in a single year (Jeff Lisandro and George Danzer have since tied the record). He won a Pot Limit Omaha event once again in 2005 for $635,603. 

In 2009, Ivey won his sixth career bracelet in the $2,500 No-Limit 2–7 Draw Lowball Event of the 2009 WSOP. He defeated a field of 147 players to catch his bracelet. He won a heads-up battle against John Monnette. He proceeded to win another bracelet in the $2,500 1/2 Seven Card Stud Hi/Lo 1/2 Omaha Hi/Lo event besting a field of 376 people. He defeated Ming Lee heads-up.

In the 2010 World Series of Poker, Ivey received the most votes for the Tournament of Champions.

At the 2010 WSOP, Ivey won his eighth bracelet in the $3,000 H.O.R.S.E. event in a final table made up of other notable players, which included Bill Chen (2nd), John Juanda (3rd), Jeff Lisandro (5th), and Chad Brown (8th). At the 2024 WSOP, Ivey won his 11th bracelet in the $10,000 Limit 2-7 Lowball Triple Draw Championship for $347,440.

Between 2002 and 2009, Ivey finished among the top 25 players in the Main Event four times, in fields ranging in size from 600 entrants to just under 7,000. Ivey finished 23rd in 2002, 10th in 2003, 20th in 2005, and 7th in 2009. Ivey&#x27;s 10th place finished in the 2003 WSOP Main Event was one place short of the final table. He was eliminated by eventual champion Chris Moneymaker on a hand where Ivey&#x27;s full house was defeated by Moneymaker&#x27;s larger full house on a river card. In his 7th place finish in 2009, his lost to Darvin Moon&#x27;s when a queen paired Moon on the flop; he ended his 2009 Main Event with winnings of $1,404,002.

With 11 World Series of Poker bracelets, Ivey currently has the second most WSOP titles all-time, second only to Phil Hellmuth Jr. Also, at age 38, he was the youngest player to ever win ten bracelets. He broke Phil Hellmuth&#x27;s mark of 42 years old at the time of his tenth bracelet. In addition, no other player has accumulated ten bracelets more quickly; it took Ivey only 14 years from the time of his first bracelet to his tenth (Phil Hellmuth took 17 years). He is the all-time record holder for most bracelets won in non-Holdem events, with all 11 of his victories coming in non-Holdem events. His 2010 win gave him the lead over Billy Baxter. He is the WSOP record holder for most mixed-game bracelets having won five in his career. He won one in S.H.O.E. in 2002, Omaha Hi/Lo / 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo in 2009, H.O.R.S.E. in 2010, WSOP APAC Mixed Event in 2013, and Eight Game Mix in 2014.

, Ivey&#x27;s total live tournament winnings exceed $38.3 million. He has 11 cashes in his live poker career worth at least $1 million. Over $9.2 million of his total winnings have come from cashes at the WSOP. He is currently ranked 11th on the all-time money list.

====Cash games====
Ivey is a regular participant in the $4,000–$8,000 mixed cash game at the Bellagio in Las Vegas (often referred to as the Big Game). In February 2006, he played heads-up Limit Texas Hold&#x27;em versus Texas billionaire Andy Beal. With stakes at $25,000/$50,000 and $50,000/$100,000, Ivey won over $16,000,000 over the course of three days, during a heads up match at The Wynn Resort. Ivey was playing for &quot;The Corporation&quot;, a group of poker professionals who pooled their money and took turns playing against Beal. Earlier in the month, Beal had beaten the Corporation out of over $13,000,000.

===Online poker===
Ivey was part of the original design team for Full Tilt Poker. In May 2011, Ivey filed a lawsuit in Clark County, Nevada claiming Full Tilt had breached his contract. The suit asked for damages in excess of $150,000,000, as well as for him to be released from his contract with the company. Ivey voluntarily withdrew the suit on June 30.

According to HighStakesDB.com, Ivey won $1.99 million on FullTilt in 2007, $7.34 million in 2008, $6.33 million in 2009, and $3 million in 2010.

==Edge-sorting litigation==
Ivey has twice been successfully sued by casinos on accusations of breach of contract, both incidents being due to his manipulation of edge sorting. He lost all court challenges (initial and appeals) in both incidents, though an appeal court in the second incident arranged a mediation which led to an agreed settlement between Ivey and the casino.

In August 2012, Ivey was reported to have won £7,300,000 (US$) playing Punto banco at Crockfords, a casino in London, but was refused payment beyond his initial £1 million stake due to his use of edge sorting. He issued a statement through his lawyers denying any misconduct: &quot;Any allegations of wrongdoing by Crockfords are denied by me in the very strongest of terms.&quot;

In April 2014, the Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey sued Ivey, claiming he cheated at baccarat by taking advantage of a defect in the manufacturing of the playing cards. Both Crockfords and the Borgata used the same kind of playing cards, manufactured by Gemaco, at Ivey&#x27;s demand. The Borgata sued Gemaco as well as Ivey. The US casino sued Ivey for $15.6 million, a total which included $10 million in winnings, $5.4 million the casino’s legal team figured the casino would have beaten Ivey for if he had been playing without an improper advantage, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in comps.

On October 8, 2014, a UK court held that the techniques Ivey used at Crockford&#x27;s constituted cheating and decided for the casino with costs.

In November 2015, Ivey was given permission to appeal. However, on November 3, 2016, his appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, upholding the earlier decision that the technique amounted to cheating. A further appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom led to a unanimous judgement delivered on October 25, 2017, which found in favor of the casino. The court concluded that Ivey&#x27;s actions constituted cheating and that, had it been necessary to make a finding on dishonesty, it would have determined that Ivey&#x27;s &quot;conduct was dishonest&quot;.

In January 2019, a federal judge allowed the Borgata to pursue Ivey&#x27;s assets in Nevada to recoup more than $10 million he won at the casino using edge-sorting.

On June 27, 2019, the US Marshals Service served a writ of execution to the World Series of Poker and seized Ivey&#x27;s 2019 winnings to be used towards payment to The Borgata.

After an oral argument on September 17, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit referred Ivey and the Borgata to the court’s mediation program. On July 10, 2020, Card Player magazine reported the parties had agreed to a settlement.

==Personal life==
Ivey was born in Riverside, California, and moved to Roselle, New Jersey, when he was three months old. He graduated from Old Bridge High School in Old Bridge Township, New Jersey.

Ivey resides in Las Vegas. In December 2009, Ivey and his then wife, Luciaetta, filed a joint petition for divorce after seven years of marriage. The divorce was granted on December 29, 2009.

Ivey is a Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets fan. Aside from poker, Ivey&#x27;s hobbies include sports betting, prop betting, and golf. He participated in the inaugural World Series of Golf, where he finished in fourth place in the final group.

Ivey has given money to a number of charitable causes. In March 2008, he donated $50,000 to Empowered 2 Excel, a Las Vegas charity for underprivileged children, and later that week created the Budding Ivey Foundation, a non-profit organization to continue the work of his grandfather, Leonard &quot;Bud&quot; Simmons. The foundation raised $260,000 (mostly for Empowered 2 Excel) at a July 3, 2008, charity poker tournament, and is also involved in children&#x27;s literacy projects and programs to feed the homeless. In 2010, he also partnered with the Make-A-Wish Foundation to bring three children to the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. Each child was given $100 and competed in roulette, baccarat, and craps with Ivey. Ivey has also founded two companies. Ivey Poker, established in 2012 offers a &quot;play for free&quot; poker App that allows users to compete against Ivey and other pros. Ivey League was a poker training site with a full roster of professional coaches launched in 2014.

<text>The Interstate Bridge (also Columbia River Interstate Bridge, I-5 Bridge, Portland-Vancouver Interstate Bridge, Vancouver-Portland Bridge) is a pair of nearly identical steel vertical-lift, Parker through-truss bridges that carry Interstate 5 traffic over the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington and Portland, Oregon in the United States.

The present-day northbound bridge opened to traffic in 1917 as a single bridge carrying two-way traffic. A second twin bridge, which carries southbound traffic, opened in 1958. The twin bridges are each over long and carry three lanes of traffic. The bridges handle a combined 130,000 vehicles daily. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, as the &quot;Portland–Vancouver Highway Bridge&quot;.

Since 2005, several proposals for replacing the bridge have been produced and debated. The bridge is considered responsible for traffic congestion of both road and river vehicles. Plans for a replacement bridge, known as the Columbia River Crossing (CRC) project, estimated to cost at least $3.4 billion, had come together by 2012 after many delays, but were very controversial, with both strong support and strong opposition. In late June 2013, the CRC project was canceled, after the Washington state legislature declined to authorize funding for the project. The Interstate Bridge Replacement Program, a joint effort between ODOT, WSDOT, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Metro, Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council, the cities of Portland and Vancouver, the Port of Portland, and the Port of Vancouver USA, was relaunched in 2017.

==First bridge==
Before a permanent crossing existed between Portland and Vancouver, there was an overcrowded ferry system operated by Pacific Railway, Light &amp; Power Co.

Plans for the original bridge began as early as 1912, with local efforts leading to an initial survey and bond measures totaling $2,000,000; $1.5 million contributed from Portland, and $500,000 from Vancouver. Waddell &amp; Harrington were retained as the project&#x27;s consulting engineers. Construction on the bridge began in March 1915, and the structure opened on February 14, 1917 at a final cost of $1.75 million (equivalent to $ million in ), which was shared between Clark and Multnomah counties. Clark County paid $500,000 and Multnomah County paid $1.25 million—probably proportional to population.

The first bridge has a total of 13 steel spans, with three measuring in length and the remaining ten spans each. Piers sit atop pile caps on wooden pilings approximately 70 feet deep. One of the spans is the lift span for allowing river traffic under the bridge. The lift span is capable of moving vertically, and provides of clearance below when fully raised. The towers are
 tall, above the roadway.

The original paved roadway was wide and had a wide sidewalk. It was the first automobile bridge across the river between Washington and Oregon, and the second to span the river at all, after the Wenatchee Bridge of 1908. It was originally a toll bridge costing 5¢ per vehicle or per horse and rider, equivalent to $ in . In 1928 the states of Washington and Oregon jointly purchased the bridge from the counties and discontinued tolling the following year. The Oregon Department of Transportation became the lead agency responsible for the maintenance and operations of the structure.

Electric streetcars operated across the bridge from opening day in 1917 until 1940. The bridge&#x27;s deck carried dual gauge track, to accommodate both Vancouver&#x27;s standard gauge cars and Portland&#x27;s gauge cars. Before the bridge, Portland had had a Vancouver streetcar line since 1893, but it ran to Hayden Island, where passengers transferred to a ferry owned by the street railway company to continue across the river to Vancouver. Streetcar service across the Interstate Bridge ended on September 3, 1940.

The bridge became part of then-new Interstate 5 in 1957. It was previously part of U.S. Route 99 when that route was established in 1926.

==Second bridge and renovations==
Plans to address congestion on the first Interstate Bridge, which carried over 30,000 vehicles per day by 1948, were drawn after World War II by highway officials in Oregon. The chief highway engineer, R. H. Baldock, proposed a second span over the Columbia River after it was determined that expanding the existing bridge was not feasible. Several sites were proposed and surveyed, but ultimately a twinned span west of the original bridge was chosen in September 1950 by Oregon and Washington. The proposed reinstatement of the toll led to a lawsuit that was heard by the Washington Supreme Court in September 1953 and decided in the states&#x27; favor.

In 1958, a $14.5 million ($ million in dollars) project created a second, almost identical span and doubled the capacity of the bridge. The new bridge was built with a &quot;humpback&quot; that provides of vertical clearance and minimizes bridge openings. Construction began in summer 1956, and the new, parallel bridge opened to traffic on July 1, 1958.

At the time the new bridge was opened, the old one was temporarily closed for rebuilding to give it a matching humpback section. When both bridges were first open concurrently, on January 8, 1960, each bridge became one-way (the new bridge for southbound traffic and the old one for northbound traffic) and tolls were reinstated at $0.20 for cars, $0.40 for light trucks, and $0.60 for heavy trucks and buses. The tolls were removed in 1966 after the construction expenses were paid off.

A $3 million ($ million in dollars) upgrade to the lift cables, expansion joints, and a deck repaving was completed in 1990. The diesel generator used to power the lift was replaced in 1995 at a cost of $150,000. In 1999, the bridge was repainted at a cost of $17 million. A $10.8 million electrical upgrade was completed in mid-May 2005. The damaged trunnion on the northbound bridge was replaced in September 1997, requiring a full shutdown of I-5 for six days; the project was completed ahead of the original schedule, which anticipated a 21-day closure. A temporary commuter train was operated by Amtrak from Union Station in Portland and Vancouver station during peak hours. The free trains had ten round trips and drew an average of 1,335 passengers per day; the low ridership was attributed to the isolated location of Vancouver&#x27;s station. The northbound bridge&#x27;s trunnion was replaced in 2020 with all traffic carried on the southbound bridge, arranged into two lanes in the peak direction controlled by a zipper machine.

==Vertical lift==

The bridge is long with a main span of . The vertical lift provides of river clearance when fully opened. Openings last about ten minutes and occur between 20 and 30 times per month, or around 300 per year.

Outside peak commuting times (6:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m), marine traffic is granted right of way at the bridge by federal law (33 CFR 117.869).

In 2006, the six total lanes of the bridges carried 130,000 vehicles daily. Full traffic capacity occurs four hours every day.

The Interstate Bridge&#x27;s name is a simple descriptive one based on its location, as a bridge connecting two states. In 1917, the new bridge gave its name to a Portland arterial street. Shortly before the bridge opened, a pair of streets through North Portland that were planned to be treated as the main route to and from the bridge, Maryland Avenue and Patton Avenue, were renamed Interstate Avenue.

==Replacement planning==
===Columbia River Crossing (2005–2013)===

The bridge is frequently a bottleneck which impacts both traffic on the freeway, as well as on the river. The Oregon and Washington transportation departments are jointly studying how to replace the bridge. Both spans have been rated as &quot;functionally obsolete,&quot; with sufficiency ratings of 18.3% and 49.4% for the original and second spans, respectively. Initially, the estimated cost for a replacement bridge was around $2 billion, but that number has climbed steadily to around $3.4 billion. An independent study in 2010 estimated the full cost to be closer to $10 billion.

Design of a replacement (especially a fixed-span bridge) is complicated by the existence of a railroad drawbridge crossing the Columbia a short distance downriver (on the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6), which constrains the location of the shipping channel; and by approach paths to Portland International Airport in Portland and to Pearson Field in Vancouver, which limit the height of any new structure. Some have proposed replacing the bridge in a different location. There were originally 12 transportation plans that were being studied to improve and expand the Interstate 5 crossing of the Columbia River. In late 2006, four of these plans were selected for a final proposal, along with a fifth no-build option. The Columbia River Crossing project&#x27;s six local partner agencies selected a replacement I-5 bridge and light rail extension to Clark College as the project&#x27;s Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) in 2008.

There is also a longstanding debate as to whether or not a new bridge would include a MAX Light Rail line, express buses, or bus rapid transit. During his 2007 &quot;State of the City&quot; address, Vancouver mayor Royce Pollard stated 

In December 2007, Oregon governor Ted Kulongoski advocated for a new bridge, publicly endorsing the Oregon Business Plan&#x27;s proposal.

In 2008, as fuel prices increased and project cost estimates soared, many in the area began questioning whether the project is worth the costs. In addition, many on the Portland side of the river fear that a 12-lane highway bridge to Vancouver, which many also believe has virtually no land use restrictions, will encourage suburban sprawl and development north of the river.
Further concerns over the 12-lane &quot;Columbia River Crossing&quot; (CRC) proposal include its failure to examine critical environmental impacts, such as damage to Clark County&#x27;s drinking water supply, endangered fish habitat in the Columbia, and air pollution in North Portland.

In 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency found that the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the CRC had failed to adequately cover these issues, as well as the potential induced demand for suburban sprawl. In a letter to CRC planners, the EPA wrote that &quot;There was no indication (in the CRC environmental impact statement) of how these vulnerable populations might be impacted by air pollution, noise, diesel construction vehicles and increased traffic&quot;, referring to minority communities in North Portland.

In June 2013, the Washington Legislature voted against further funding of the CRC. On June 29, Oregon Governor Kitzhaber directed the CRC to shut down operations.

===Interstate Bridge Replacement Program (2019–present)===
The relaunched Interstate Bridge Replacement Program is a joint effort between ODOT, WSDOT, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Metro, Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council, the cities of Portland and Vancouver, the Port of Portland, and the Port of Vancouver USA.

The Joint Oregon-Washington Legislative Action Committee was formed by the Washington legislature in 2017 to study a bridge replacement, but initially had no Oregon representation for a year. The new committee was formed to prevent $140 million in federal funding allocated for the CRC from being recalled after a deadline, which was extended to 2025. In April 2019, the Washington legislature approved $17.5 million to establish a project office to conduct pre-design and planning work, which was followed by a matching contribution from the Oregon Transportation Commission in August.

A new timeline for the project, with the start of environmental review in 2020 and construction by 2025, was approved by the joint committee in late 2019. The replacement bridge&#x27;s design is unspecified, with discussions about the inclusion of light rail, lane configurations, and investigating a third crossing all under consideration. Former Michigan Department of Transportation deputy director Greg Johnson was appointed as the bridge program administrator in June 2020. Several alternative ideas have been proposed, including an immersed tube tunnel, a third bridge, and a bascule bridge favored by the U.S. Coast Guard, but have been rejected for their drawbacks and cost.

, the project is estimated to cost $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion. The locally preferred alternative selected in 2022 is an eight-lane bridge with a light rail guideway on the west side and several modified interchanges. The U.S. Coast Guard requested an alternative design with a drawbridge to preserve the clearance for river traffic, which would be lowered by if the locally preferred alternative was built. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2025 or early 2026. Tolls will be implemented on the Oregon side of the existing bridge to help fund the new bridge as it is being built.

<text>The Czech Republic men&#x27;s national ice hockey team is the national ice hockey team of the Czech Republic. Since 2021, the team has been officially known in English as Czechia. It is one of the most successful national ice hockey teams in history and a member of the so-called &quot;Big Six&quot;, the unofficial group of the six strongest men&#x27;s ice hockey nations, along with Canada, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States. It is governed by the Czech Ice Hockey Association. The Czech Republic has 85,000 male players officially enrolled in organized hockey (0.8% of its population).

==History==
The Czech national team was formed following the breakup of Czechoslovakia, as the country was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic was recognized as the successor to Czechoslovakia and retained in the highest pool (A), while Slovakia was required start international play in pool C. &quot;See also Post-Cold War period of the IIHF world championships&quot;.

The Czechs won the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics. In 2024, the team was recognized with the IIHF Milestone Award, given by the International Ice Hockey Federation to a team that made a significant contribution to the development of international hockey. The 1998 Olympic hockey tournament was also the first the include National Hockey League players. The IIHF reported the gold medal to be &quot;the most important event in the country&#x27;s history after the 1968 Uprising&quot;.

The Czechs won three straight gold medals at the world championships from 1999 to 2001. In the next three years, the team did not get a medal at the world championships—not even home at the 2004 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships held in Prague and Ostrava, thus keeping the &quot;world championship home ice curse&quot; alive. The following year, however, the Czechs won gold at the 2005 tournament, the only world championship where, due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, all NHL players were available to participate.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics, the Czechs won a bronze medal, defeating Russia 3–0 (roster) in the bronze medal game. At the 2006 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, the Czechs earned silver, falling to Sweden in the final, the only time the Czechs have lost the final game of the tournament. The Czech Republic won the 2010 World Championships in Germany. For the first time in history, the Czech Republic did not qualify for the quarterfinals at the 2022 Winter Olympics and finished in ninth place, their lowest placement in history. However, they won a bronze medal at the 2022 IIHF World Championship later the same year, ending its longest medal drought in IIHF tournaments history, which had lasted since 2012. In 2023, the Czech Republic finished in eighth place at the World Championship, which is the worst placement in history. At the 2024 IIHF World Championship, they ended their 14-year gold drought after winning it for the first time since 2010, also as hosts.

<text>Don Perrin (born 1 October 1964) is a Canadian writer and former military officer.

==Early life and education==
Born in Iserlohn, Germany, Perrin grew up in Kingston, ON, Canada, McMasterville, QC, Canada, Bromley, Kent, England, and Ottawa, ON, Canada. Perrin served in the Canadian Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, in the Canadian Department of National Defence. He holds a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Physics from the Royal Military College of Canada in 1987.

==Career==
Don Perrin was Vice President of Operations with Mag Force 7, Inc. He wrote a series of novels in the Mag Force 7 series, with the first hitting the shelf in April 1995. He has three successful collectible game designs to his credit with Star of the Guardians Collectible Trading Card Game and Wing Commander Collectible Trading Card Game, and the Star Trek: the Card Game. Perrin has also designed role playing products for Imperium Games&#x27;s Traveller RPG Universe. For the fourth edition of &quot;Traveller&quot; (also called &quot;Marc Miller&#x27;s Traveller&quot; or &quot;T4&quot;) published by Imperium in 1996, each of the designers worked on separate portions of the rules, with Perrin writing rules for starships. Perrin then worked on the game &quot;Zero&quot; (1997) for Archangel Entertainment. Perrin is also a contributor to the Dragonlance novel series.

Perrin and Lester Smith designed the &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; RPG (1998) based on the trilogy of &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; books, and Margaret Weis formed the company Sovereign Press with herself as CEO to publish the RPG. Perrin announced on April 17, 2001, that Sovereign Press would replace its original game system for &quot;Sovereign Stone&quot; with a line based on the D20 System. To support the setting, Weis and Perrin wrote a short story titled &quot;Shadamehr and the Old Wives Tale&quot; which was published in &quot;Dragon&quot; #264 (October, 1999). Wizards of the Coast licensed the Dragonlance setting to Sovereign Press as the result of an agreement in 2002 to be used for role-playing publication; Weis and Perrin wrote the &quot;Dragonlance Campaign Setting&quot; (2003), with Jamie Chambers and Christopher Coyle, which Wizards of the Coast published, and afterwards allowed Sovereign Press to further expand on the material in that book by publishing supplements making use of the d20 license. Perrin left Sovereign Press in 2004 and Weis then formed the new company Margaret Weis Productions.

Perrin acted as an advisor for Margaret Weis on the final Star of the Guardians novel, &quot;Ghost Legion&quot; (in which he also appears as a character). The couple co-authored the Mag Force 7 novels.

Don Perrin, Michael Cosentino and Kathyrn Plamback purchased the two US wargaming magazines, &quot;The Courier&quot; and &quot;MWAN&quot; and combined them into the Historical Miniature Gamer Magazine in 2005. This magazine won the Nonfiction Publication of the Year Award at the 32nd Annual Origins Awards. The magazine offered articles on wargaming/wargames (of widely varied periods), tips on painting, building hints, scenarios, reviews of wargaming books, rules, miniatures and a monthly column by Howard Whitehouse. In 2007 James Manto was brought in as editor-in-chief to help with the organization and structure of the articles. Taking advantage of Perrin&#x27;s QPOD (Quality Printing on Demand) in-house printing (where small numbers of books, rules, supplements can be printed inexpensively) the magazine underwent a complete overhaul to an easy to hold quarterly magazine. The magazine was closed in 2008.

==Personal life==
Perrin was married to Margaret Weis, though they are now divorced.

Perrin married Kathryn Plamback in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2016.

He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.

<doc id="949904" wikidata="Q511513" url="?curid=949904" title="Jakob Johann von Uexküll">
<text>Jakob Johann Freiherr von Uexküll (; ; – 25 July 1944) was a Baltic German biologist who worked in the fields of muscular physiology and animal behaviour studies and was an influence on the cybernetics of life. However, his most notable contribution is the notion of &quot;Umwelt&quot;, used by semiotician Thomas Sebeok and philosopher Martin Heidegger. His works established biosemiotics as a field of research.

==Early life==
The son of Baron Alexander von Uexküll and Sophie von Hahn, Jakob von Uexküll was born in the Keblas estate, Sankt Michaelis, Governorate of Estonia. His aristocratic family lost most of their fortune by expropriation during the Russian Revolution. Needing to support himself, Uexküll took a job as professor at the University of Hamburg where he founded the &quot;Institut für Umweltforschung&quot;.

==Umwelt==
Uexküll was particularly interested in how living beings perceive their environment(s). He argued that organisms experience life in terms of species-specific, spatio-temporal, &quot;self-in-world&quot; subjective reference frames that he called &quot;Umwelt&quot; (translated as &quot;surrounding-world&quot;, &quot;phenomenal world&quot;, &quot;self-world&quot;, &quot;environment&quot; - lit. German &quot;environment&quot;). These &quot;Umwelten&quot; (plural of &quot;Umwelt&quot;) are distinctive from what Uexküll termed the &quot;Umgebung&quot; which would be the living being&#x27;s surroundings as seen from the likewise peculiar perspective or &quot;Umwelt&quot; of the human observer. &quot;Umwelt&quot; may thus be defined as the perceptual world in which an organism exists and acts as a subject. By studying how the senses of various organisms like ticks, sea urchins, amoebae, jellyfish and sea worms work, he was able to build theories of how they experience the world. Because all organisms perceive and react to sensory data as signs, Uexküll argued that they were to be considered as living subjects. This argument was the basis for his biological theory in which the characteristics of biological existence (&quot;life&quot;) could not simply be described as a sum of its non-organic parts, but had to be described as subject and a part of a sign system.

The biosemiotic turn in Jakob von Uexküll&#x27;s analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal&#x27;s relationship with its environment. The &quot;Umwelt&quot; is for him an environment-world which is (according to Giorgio Agamben), &quot;constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] &quot;carriers of significance&quot; or &quot;marks&quot; which are the only things that interest the animal&quot;. Agamben goes on to paraphrase one example from Uexküll&#x27;s discussion of a tick, saying,
&quot;...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin&#x27;s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood.&quot;
Thus, for the tick, the &quot;Umwelt&quot; is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, (2) The temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (corresponding to the blood of all mammals), (3) The hairiness of mammals.

==Theoretical biology==
Uexküll anticipated many computer science ideas, particularly in the field of robotics, roughly 25 years before these things were invented.

Uexküll views organisms in terms of information processing. He argues every organism has an outer boundary which defines an Umwelt (German word generally meaning &quot;environment&quot;, &quot;surrounding world&quot;). Rather than the general meaning, Uexküll&#x27;s concept draws on the literal meaning of the German word, which is &quot;surround-world&quot;, to define the Umwelt as the subjectively perceived surroundings about which information is available to an organism through its senses. This is a subjective &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, or &quot;world view&quot;, and is therefore fundamentally different from the black box concept, which is derived from the objective Newtonian viewpoint.

The organism has sensors that report the state of the &quot;Umwelt&quot; and effectors that can change parts of the &quot;Umwelt&quot;. He distinguished the effector as the logical opposite of the sensor, or sense organ. Sensors and effectors are linked in a feedback loop. Sensor input is processed by a &quot;Merkorgan&quot; and effectors are controlled by a &quot;Werkorgan&quot;. The modern term &quot;sensorimotor&quot; used in enactive theories of cognition encompasses these concepts.

He further distinguishes the &quot;Umgebung&quot; (that part of the &quot;Umwelt&quot; that represents distal features of the external world, in German &quot;that which is being given as surroundings&quot;) from the Innenwelt which is reported directly by sensors and is therefore the only unmediated reality immediately knowable to the organism. The relationship between the distal (mediated, transformed) features of the Umgebung and the proximal (untransformed, unmediated, primal) features of the Innenwelt must be learned by the organism in infancy. The nature of the Umgebung::Innenwelt relationship is relevant to the later theories of embodied cognition.

This is also similar to Kant&#x27;s phenomenon and noumenon but derived logically from the properties of the sensors. What we now call a &quot;feedback loop&quot; he calls a &quot;function-circle&quot; and &quot;circle&quot; seems to be something like &quot;system&quot;. He uses the term &quot;melody&quot; to mean something close to &quot;algorithm&quot;. He coins around 75 technical terms, and a proper understanding of his book would require clearly defining them in modern terms and understanding their relations. He notices qualia, comes close to object-oriented programming (page 98) uses the image of a helmsman which later showed up as &quot;cybernetics&quot; (page 291) and makes a good guess about DNA (page 127). He has a large number of ideas, although not expressed clearly in modern terms. His metaphysics is hyper-Kantian (&quot;All reality is subjective appearance&quot;, page xv.) Space is a set of direction symbols. He rejects Darwin and says nothing of God. Organisms are based on something called &quot;Plan&quot;, the origin of which we cannot know.

Uexküll was an advocate of non-Darwinian evolution and critic of Darwinism. Kalevi Kull noted that &quot;despite his opposition to Darwinism, Uexküll was not anti-evolutionist&quot;.

== Influence ==
Works by scholars such as Kalevi Kull connect Uexküll&#x27;s studies with some areas of philosophy such as phenomenology and hermeneutics. Jakob von Uexküll&#x27;s theory of biosemiotics directly influenced N. Katherine Hayles&#x27; concept of cybersemiotics.

However, despite his influence on the work of philosophers Max Scheler, Ernst Cassirer, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Peter Wessel Zapffe, Humberto Maturana, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari (in their &quot;A Thousand Plateaus&quot;, for example) and José Ortega y Gasset he is still not widely known, and his books are mostly out of print in German and in English. A paperback French translation of &quot;Streifzüge durch die Umwelten von Tieren und Menschen&quot; [A stroll through the Umwelten of animals and humans] of 1934 is currently in print. This book has been translated in English as &quot;A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with A Theory of Meaning&quot; by Jakob von Uexküll, translated by Joseph D. O&#x27;Neil, introduction by Dorion Sagan, University of Minnesota Press, 2011. The other available book is &quot;Theoretical Biology&quot;, a reprint of the 1926 translation of &quot;Theoretische Biologie&quot; (1920). &quot;Foray&quot; is a popular introduction while &quot;Theoretical Biology&quot; is intended for an academic audience.

== Family ==
His sons were the physician Thure von Uexküll and journalist Gösta von Uexküll. His daughter was Sophie Luise Damajanti von Uexküll (&#x27;Dana&#x27;). His grandson is the writer Jakob von Uexküll.

== Involvement with National Socialism ==
In 2021 Gottfried Schnödl and Florian Sprenger proved that Uexküll was much more deeply involved in National Socialism than previously known. In 1933 he signed the &quot;Confession of German Professors to Adolf Hitler&quot;. In May 1934, together with Martin Heidegger, Carl Schmitt, and Alfred Rosenberg, among others, he was a founding member of the Committee for Philosophy of Law of the Academy for German Law, both of which were headed by Hans Frank. This committee was to accompany the National Socialist program with a philosophy of law appropriate to &quot;Germanness.&quot; In doing so, Uexküll did not merely seek a connection to National Socialism, but actively participated in the collaborative elaboration of a National Socialist philosophy of law and attempted to substantiate it through his conception of Umwelt. Uexküll&#x27;s doctrine led to a holistically based rejection of democracy and discharged itself in an identitarian logic in which everything is in its place according to plan and that which is in the wrong place should disappear.

As late as 1933 Uexküll held hopes that the rise of Hitler to power might bring an end to the expansion of communism and the democratization of German society, for which he had an aristocratic antipathy, but his expectations were met with disappointment. In May of the same year Uexküll wrote a letter to Eva Wagner Chamberlain, daughter of Richard Wagner, and wife of his late friend Houston Stewart Chamberlain, lamenting that the ideas of her husband were being used by Nazism to justify the persecution of Jews in Germany, and describing racial discrimination against Jews as &quot;the worst kind of barbarism&quot;. By the autumn of 1933, Uexküll evinced disapproval of Nazi policy and ideology, and afterwards tried to avoid political issues, although it sometimes proved impossible. In 1934, Uexküll dedicated his book &quot;A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans&quot; to a Jewish fellow researcher Otto Cohnheim, who, in his words, &quot;lost his appointment as a university professor because of racial politics&quot;.

Following the publication of Sprengers and Schnödls book, there have been discussions about Uexkülls role in the early 1930s. As Sprenger and Schnödl show, there are no reliable historical sources for many of the assumptions that have been used to defend Uexküll. These anecdotes are taken from a biography of Uexküll written by his wife, Gudrun von Uexküll, in 1964. This book defends Uexküll against all accusations, but does not give any reliable sources or references. For example, Carlos Brentari refers to Uexkülls autobiographical book of personal reminiscences, &quot;Nie geschaute Welten&quot; (Worlds never seen). Brentari argues that in this book, Uexküll wrote favorably of the Russian Jews and the Baroness Rothschild. He even states that the book officially banned from display in bookshop windows. This assumption has turned out wrong: The book is not listed on any of the National Socialist&#x27;s lists of banned books. And, contrary to Brentari, Uexküll takes up the idea of the Jews as &quot;parasitic plants&quot; which only grow where they belong. As Sprenger writes: &quot;This rhetoric already holds the germ of the idea that the host must rid itself of this parasite, despite all sympathies he may harbor for individual members of the alien race, and thus end the supposed abuse of his hospitality. It is precisely because the Jewish population is understood as a parasite that it can, in Uexküll&#x27;s representation, be so easily expelled: transplanted elsewhere, it will be able to live just as well; but there, too, it may also spread parasitically.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Uexküll&#x27;s ideas about how organisms create their own concept of time are described in Peter Høeg&#x27;s novel &quot;Borderliners&quot;, and contrasted with Isaac Newton&#x27;s view of time as something that exists independent of life.

Uexküll&#x27;s umwelt concept is described and used as a basic concept in Edmund Soon-Weng Yong&#x27;s book &quot;An Immense World: How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us&quot; (2022).

<doc id="949918" wikidata="Q1399540" url="?curid=949918" title="RAF Nordhorn">
<text>Royal Air Force Nordhorn, more commonly known as RAF Nordhorn, is a former military aviation bombing and gunnery range to the east of nearby Nordhorn, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The range was used by the British Royal Air Force (RAF), the German Luftwaffe, and other NATO air forces and aviation arms of their other branches (such as the Army Air Corps, and the Fleet Air Arm). For decades it was part of RAF Germany.

The first use for gunnery purposes was by the Wehrmacht in 1933, when the heaths to the east of the town of Nordhorn were used for artillery target practice. The RAF took over the range in 1945. The station played host to several Polish units, No. 302 Polish Fighter Squadron, No. 308 Polish Fighter Squadron, No. 317 Polish Fighter Squadron, and No. 662 Squadron RAF for short periods in April 1945. Also resident for a time was No. 131 Wing RAF, the First Polish Fighter Wing.

During the Cold War, the daily flights over the town of Nordhorn were a constant reminder to the local townspeople of the ongoing struggle with the Soviets, despite the great distance to the border with communist East Germany.

Despite the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the base remained as one of the few military facilities used by British Armed Forces in Germany. In 1996, as British forces were withdrawn from the rest of Germany, the Nordhorn aerodrome was expanded. Also in 1996, the UK Ministry of Defence decided to hand control of the base to the German government within a timeframe of ten years. It was transferred back to the German Bundeswehr in March 2001 and the RAF left the site.

President Trujillo was moved by the idea as he found out that in Latin America only three countries (Cuba and Mexico) had TV stations, and in the early 1950s, what is called Radio Television Dominicana (RTVD) was founded. Dominican Republic become the 3rd country in Latin America with TV station.

Its current name is Corporación Estatal de Radio y Televisión (CERTV) and operates only on channel 4.

<text>USS &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; (SSBN-658), was a fleet ballistic missile submarine, was named for Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (1807–1890), a key proponent of California statehood. The boat&#x27;s service extended from 1966 until 1995.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, on 8 August 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 7 July 1964. She was launched on 23 October 1965, sponsored by Miss Patricia Oliver Vallejo McGettigan, great-great- granddaughter of Mariano Vallejo, and commissioned on 16 December 1966, with Commander Douglas B. Guthe commanding the Blue Crew and Commander John K. Nunneley commanding the Gold Crew.

==Service history==
&quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; conducted shakedown and training exercises along the United States West Coast, in the Caribbean Sea, and off the coast of Florida. Transiting the Panama Canal for the second time on 21 March 1967, she headed for her assigned home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Arriving there on 10 April 1967, she continued training exercises and sound trials, then returned briefly to Mare Island Naval Shipyard. From there she sailed back to Pearl Harbor, becoming, as of 1 August 1967, a fully operational unit of Submarine Squadron 15, ready to conduct strategic deterrent patrols.

&quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; was the last to patrol, last to off-load her missiles and the last to arrive in Washington making her the last of the &quot;Forty-one for Freedom.&quot; On 2 August 1994, the submarine left Charleston for the last time. She arrived at the Panama Canal on 10 August and during the voyage to San Diego transited from the epicenter of a 7.2 earthquake. In port at the Mare Island shipyard the crew hosted over three thousand tours of the boat in eleven days.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; was both decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 March 1995. Her scrapping via the U.S. Navy″s Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Bremerton, Washington, began on 1 October 1994 and was completed on 22 December 1995.

==Commemoration==
&quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot;″s sail was preserved, and has been on the waterfront at Mare Island since 1995. Much of this time, the sail sat at the docks, exposed to the elements and mostly neglected. As of 2019, it was moved to a permanent memorial located within the Mare Island Museum as part of the Save-Our-Sail Project. In addition to the preservation of the sail, the control room of &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot; was reconstructed including a fully operational periscope from &quot;Mariano G. Vallejo&quot;.

A Google Street View of the boat&#x27;s sail prior to its installation at the museum is located here.

<text>Podocarpus macrophyllus is a conifer in the genus &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, family Podocarpaceae. It is the northernmost species of the genus, native to southern Japan and southern and eastern China. Common names in English include yew plum pine, Buddhist pine, fern pine and Japanese yew. and are Japanese names for this tree. In China, it is known as &quot;luóhàn sōng&quot; (), which literally means &quot;arhat pine&quot;.

==Description==

It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, reaching tall. The leaves are strap-shaped, long, and about 1 cm broad, with a central midrib. The cones are borne on a short stem, and have two to four scales, usually only one (sometimes two) fertile, each fertile scale bearing a single apical seed 10–15 mm. When mature, the scales swell up and become reddish purple, fleshy, and berry-like, 10–20 mm long; they are then eaten by birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings.

&quot;P. macrophyllus&quot; occurs in forests, open thickets, and roadsides from near sea level to 1000 m above it.

==Symbolism, cultivation, and uses==
&quot;Kusamaki&quot; is the state tree of Chiba Prefecture, Japan. It is a popular large shrub or small tree in gardens, particularly in Japan and the Southeastern United States. The ripe cone arils are edible, though the seed should not be eaten. Because of its resistance to termites and water, &quot;inumaki&quot; is used for quality wooden houses in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

Buddhist pine is highly regarded as a &quot;feng shui&quot; tree in Hong Kong, giving it a very high market value. In recent years, the illegal digging of Buddhist pine has become a problem in the city.

This species can be trained as a bonsai.

<text>Johannes Bugenhagen (24 June 1485 – 20 April 1558), also called &quot;Doctor Pomeranus&quot; by Martin Luther, was a German theologian and Lutheran priest who introduced the Protestant Reformation in the Duchy of Pomerania and Denmark in the 16th century. Contributions of Karlstadt and Luther to the translation of theology into social legislation were most fully realized by Bugenhagen. Among his major accomplishments was organization of Lutheran churches in Northern Germany and Scandinavia. He has also been called the &quot;Second Apostle of the North&quot;.

Johannes Bugenhagen was pastor to Martin Luther at St. Mary&#x27;s church in Wittenberg. He is also commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod as a pastor on 20 April.

== Biography ==

===Early life===

Bugenhagen was born in Wollin (now Wolin), Duchy of Pomerania, on 24 June 1485 as one of three children of local Ratsherr Gerhard Bugenhagen. From 1502 to 1504, he studied artes at the University of Greifswald. In 1504, he moved to Treptow an der Rega (now Trzebiatów) and became the rector of the local school. Though he had not studied theology, he was ordained as a priest at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Treptow in 1509, and served as a vicar at the Kanonikerkolleg of that church thereafter.

In 1517, abbot Johann Boldewan called Bugenhagen to serve as a Biblical lecturer at his nearby Belbuck Abbey, where the two became the core of a Humanist circle. Duke Bogislav X of Pomerania ordered Bugenhagen to write down the history of Pomerania in Latin. The year 1518 is the beginning of historical writing of the combined territory Pomerania.

Bugenhagen first encountered the theology of Luther in the reformer&#x27;s &quot;Prelude on the Babylonian Captivity of the Church&quot; in 1520. At first he did not like Luther&#x27;s thoughts at all. However, once he had studied it more, Bugenhagen became a supporter of the Reformation and moved to Wittenberg in 1521.

===Wittenberg===
In Wittenberg, Bugenhagen was elected parish pastor on 25 October 1523, making him Martin Luther&#x27;s pastor and confessor. He was a member of Luther&#x27;s team translating the Holy Bible from Greek and Hebrew to German, and opened the debate on Ulrich Zwingli&#x27;s reforms.

By 1523, his private lectures had become well known, so he was called to lecture the following years at the &quot;Leucorea&quot;, the university in Wittenberg (today Martin Luther University). In March 1524 the printer Adam Petri of Basel printed his &quot;Interpretations of the Psalms&quot;&quot;&quot; (Lat.&quot;Librum Psalmorum interpretatio&quot;) in the Latin language. The cover was cut after a drawing by Hans Holbein the Younger depicting biographical events of David’s life in relation to the New Testament. The book saw four further editions in the Latin language within half a year. A second edition by Adam Petri in August, one by Johannes Petreius in Nuremberg and also by Johannes Knobloch in Strassburg. Another one is assumed to have been printed by Johann Schöffer in Mainz. Two years later, a German translation was printed by Adam Petri in which for the Psalms text, the German translation by Martin Luther were used. Bugenhagen was regarded as one of the most important teachers and practitioners of biblical interpretation in the Wittenberg-centered Protestant Reformation, ordaining a generation of Lutheran pastors who were educated at this university.

On 17 March 1533, he was promoted doctor of theology at the university of Wittenberg, together with Johannes Aepinus and Kaspar Cruciger. He then became a professor in 1535. The promotion was supervised by Martin Luther, based on Philipp Melanchthon&#x27;s theses, financed and attended by Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, and formally granted by deacon Justus Jonas. With the ceremony in Wittenberg&#x27;s castle church (&quot;Schloßkirche&quot;), Aepinus, Bugenhagen and Cruciger became the first three Protestant doctors of theology.

While theological doctoral promotions had been suspended in Wittenberg for the preceding eight years, the promotion of Aepinus had become necessary as the Hamburg burghers demanded their new superintendent to bear the title of a doctor. Melanchthon had written the speech for Jonas which laid the foundation of a Protestant doctorate, and Frederick III &quot;the Wise&quot; sponsored a subsequent celebration to introduce the new Protestant doctorate to the theological world.

===Reformatory work===
After he had outlined his reform ideas in a letter to the Hamburg community, Bugenhagen was the most important figure in the Protestant Reformation in Northern Germany and Scandinavia. He took an active lead in creating new &quot;church orders&quot; (Kirchenordnungen) for Hildesheim (1544), Hamburg (1528/29), Lübeck (1530–1532), the Duchy of Pomerania (1534/5), East Frisia (1534/5), Schleswig-Holstein (1542), Braunschweig (1528), Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1543), and Denmark-Norway (1537), where he also crowned Christian III.

This earned him later the epithet &quot;Second Apostle of the North&quot;. Not only did he create the new rules, he also established them and persuaded people to follow them. Bugenhagen produced rules and regulations for religious service, for schooling, and for social issues of the church. In 1539, he became superintendent of the Lutheran Church in Saxony.

Also in 1539, Bugenhagen reformed the Pomeranian University of Greifswald, which he &quot;re-founded&quot; as a Protestant university, modelled after the university of Wittenberg.

Bugenhagen sought to inform the public that indulgences, not only done without God&#x27;s word but against it.

===Late life===

After the death of Luther in 1546, Bugenhagen took care of Luther&#x27;s widow and children. Bugenhagen died in Wittenberg in 1558 and was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Church (Stadtkirche Wittenberg). The church also contains a memorial painting to Bugenhagen by Lucas Cranach the Younger depicting the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan by John the Baptist (with the whole Bugenhagen family watching).

Other than for his theological opinions, Bugenhagen was also well known because of his organising ability. Bugenhagen was also appreciated for his work in making a Middle Low German translation of Luther&#x27;s Bible in 1534.

Johannes Bugenhagen was always a pastor at heart, and because of his love for music, his family coat of arms shows a harp.

==Family==

His daughter Sara (died 1563) married Georg Cracow.

<text>:&quot;This list contains only the films that Laurel and Hardy made together. For their solo films see Stan Laurel filmography and Oliver Hardy filmography.&quot;
Laurel and Hardy were a motion picture comedy team whose official filmography consists of 106 films released between 1921 and 1951. Together they appeared in 34 silent shorts, 45 sound shorts, and 27 full-length sound feature films. In addition to these, Laurel and Hardy appeared in at least 20 foreign-language versions of their films and a promotional film, &quot;Galaxy of Stars&quot; (1936), produced for European film distributors.

Stan Laurel (1890–1965) and Oliver Hardy (1892–1957) were established as film comedians prior to their teaming, with Laurel appearing in over 50 silent films and Hardy in over 250. (Hardy also appeared in three sound features without Laurel.) Although they first worked together in the film &quot;The Lucky Dog&quot; (1921), this was a chance pairing and it was not until 1926 when both separately signed contracts with the Hal Roach film studio that they appeared in film shorts together. Laurel and Hardy officially became a team the following year with their 11th silent short film, &quot;The Second Hundred Years&quot; (1927). The pair remained with the Roach studio until 1940. Between 1941 and 1945, they appeared in eight features and one short for 20th Century Fox and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. After finishing their film commitments, Laurel and Hardy concentrated on stage shows, embarking on a music hall tour of Great Britain. In 1950, they appeared in their last film, &quot;Atoll K&quot;, a French/Italian co-production.

In 1932, Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s short &quot;The Music Box&quot; won the Academy Award for Live Action Short Film (Comedy). In 1960, Laurel was presented with an Academy Honorary Award &quot;for his creative pioneering in the field of cinema comedy.&quot; In 1992, 1997, 2012 and 2020 respectively, &quot;Big Business&quot; (1929), &quot;The Music Box&quot;, &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot; (1933) and &quot;The Battle of the Century&quot; (1927) were added to the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; For their contributions to cinema, Laurel and Hardy have been awarded separate stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Filmography==
===Official films===
The following is a list of Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s official filmography as established in &quot;Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies&quot; by Randy Skretvedt and &quot;Laurel and Hardy&quot; by John McCabe, Al Kilgore, and Richard W. Bann. Each book lists 105 films and Skredvedt&#x27;s adds a 106th in its appendix, &quot;Now I&#x27;ll Tell One&quot;, a previously lost film that was partly rediscovered.

Except where noted, all of these films were photographed in black and white, produced by Hal Roach, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Except where noted, all short films are two reels in length. All films produced prior to 1928 are silent and all films made after 1929 are sound. Releases from 1928 are silent except as noted. 1929 releases are identified as silent, all-talkie, or sound films with music and sound effects only.

===Foreign-language versions===
During the early days of sound American motion picture companies often made foreign-language versions of their films. The following is a list of known foreign-language versions of Laurel and Hardy films.


Note: A lost German-language version of &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, &quot;Wir Schalten um auf Hollywood&quot; (We Switch to Hollywood), was made and released in 1931. Apparently Laurel and Hardy do not appear in it.

<text>RAF Oakhanger was a Royal Air Force station in Hampshire split over three operational sites; with accommodation in nearby Bordon. The main site and operations centre is located near the village of Oakhanger, the two other sites being nearby. The parent station for administrative purposes was RAF Odiham.

==History==
RAF Oakhanger was the home of No. 1001 Signal Unit, responsible for supporting satellite communications services for the British Armed Forces worldwide. The unit was made up of four sub-units: Space Operations, Ground Operations, Telemetry and Control, and Support; with subordinate detachments based at RAF Rudloe Manor, RAF Colerne and RAF Defford. Command and Control of the system was conducted from Oakhanger, with a planning unit based at Rudloe Manor, co-located with No. 1 Signal Unit and Controller Defence Communication Network. The Colerne and Defford detachments provided a ground anchoring capability for the communications spacecraft. The Defford detachment was managed by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, later QinetiQ.

Space Squadron was responsible for flying a constellation of Skynet satellites, up to the fourth iteration of six space vehicles which supported Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force units. The space vehicles were controlled on a permanent basis from Oakhanger, with command and control traffic being passed from one of the three ground stations. Space Squadron also controlled the flight of space vehicles on behalf of NATO, with an earth station at the nearby NATO ground terminal. The constellation comprised geosynchronous satellites, providing Earth coverage and higher-power coverage over Northern Europe.

Ground services was responsible for routing traffic via the space vehicles, from a number of locations in the United Kingdom, to either stationary ground terminals such as Germany, Cyprus, Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands, or tactical ground terminals, mounted in ships or vehicles. Tactical terminals were operated by the Tactical Communications Wing, 30 Signal Regiment, 16 Signal Regiment, 249 (AMF(L)) Signal Squadron, 264 (SAS) Signal Squadron, or the Royal Marines Signal Squadrons.

==Current use==
Support to British military satellite communications was outsourced to EADS Astrium&#x27;s subsidiary company—Paradigm Secure Communications—in 2003, as a Private Finance Initiative. Paradigm Secure Communications is now known as Airbus Defence and Space.

RAF Oakhanger is now used to support the Skynet 5 constellation and the United States Space Force&#x27;s Satellite Control Network. A very small contingent from the U.S. 23rd Space Operations Squadron are stationed at RAF Oakhanger who with MOD civilians and contractors provide support to over 175 U.S. and allied satellites, the only site where U.S. satellites are supported by non-U.S. personnel.

<doc id="949952" wikidata="Q735150" url="?curid=949952" title="Mule (shoe)">
<text>Mule is a style of shoe that has no back or constraint around the foot&#x27;s heel. The English word &quot;mule&quot;originally written &quot;moyle&quot;comes from French, which was using it specifically for women&#x27;s slippers with an open heel since at least 1556. There, mules were bedroom slippers and not worn in public. Through the centuries, mules have changed in style and purpose and are no longer just boudoir shoes but are worn at any time, for any occasion. In addition to Western examples, mules come from cultures such as Turkey and Egypt, and appear in popular culture, from famous paintings to iconic celebrities&#x27; shoes.
==Name==

The English word &quot;mule&quot;originally written &quot;moyle&quot;comes from French, which was using it specifically for women&#x27;s slippers with an open heel since at least 1556. This sense seems to have been mixed at the time with the idea of any shoe with an especially thick sole. Medieval Latin ) was a variant spelling of , the plural of , used by for slippers generally. This name in turn seems to have derived from the Classical (&quot;red calceus&quot;), whose color name was taken from the much-prized red and striped red mullet fish. It is much disputed whether the properly referred to the special senatorial shoe () or the older shoe particular to Rome&#x27;s patrician class () since they both seem to have usually been dyed, may have varied over time, and Roman colorsparticularly around items dyed with Tyrian purplecould encompass a large range of distinct shades. (The fish&#x27;s name itself is cognate with the Greek &quot;mélas&quot; (), usually intending black.) In any case, the connection to the later use of the name for slippers may have been that the aristocratic calceiparticularly the luxurious seem to have had a thicker-than-normal sole.

==History==
Mules of the 16th century to the 19th century were bedroom or boudoir slippers worn inside and not out in public. Accordingly, mules were worn with dressing gowns and typically matched the loose outfits by having the same comfort. The early mules did not have any distinguishable features. This style of shoe has a storied history: when Comtesse d’Olonne, the risqué society beauty, wore a soft red pair of mules to church in 1694 – daringly peeping from beneath her richly-embellished skirt – it paved the way for the style.

While mules have been worn since the 15th century to the present day, their popularity has not always been constant. They were typical indoor shoes for both men and women in the early 1700s. By the 1720s to the end of the century, mules were the most popular indoor slipper. Fashion plates that exist from the end of the 1790s describe women wearing mules but are not seen due to the long lengths of the contemporary petticoats. Therefore, they were popular by the end of the 1700 but not as visible. In the beginning of the 1800s mules went out of style. In the mid to early 1800s, they rose in popularity again.

During the mid-19th century, mules were primarily designed as comfortable indoor shoes, but may have seen some outdoor use anyways. 

&quot;Ballin&#x27; The Jack,&quot; also known as a &quot;Spring-o-Lator&quot; mule, attributed to the Herbert Levine Company, where an elastic strip in the footbed that bridged the ball of the foot to the arch, allowed the wearer to keep the shoes securely on while wearing stockings, despite the lack of any straps at the side or back of the shoes. Through much of the 1950s and 1960s a wide range of shoe designers used Herbert Levine&#x27;s Spring-o-Lator technology in their shoe lines.

In the late 20th century, mules were again in fashion as they embraced the trends. They were especially popular during the end of the 1990s in the high-fashion as elite designers put their own touch on the mule.

Most recently, Elle magazine called mules the shoe of 2017.

== Styles ==

Mules have changed in style over time. In the fifteenth century mules from Venice were stilted and resembled chopines. Their toes were of all shapes: round, square and forked. The heel similarly was not constrained in height. Heels ranged from 1 5/8 inches to 2 ½ inches. Mules were embroidered across centuries from 1550 to 1700. For example, Florentine embroidery, which is a flame stitch of various lengths, was popular during the 18th century. Throughout the 1700s, mules were regularly heeled and worn by both men and women. Between 1720 and 1790 the shoe structure itself was relatively dull and boring not to distract from eye-catchy buckles. By 1850s, heeled mules were less frequent for men. From 1885 to 1910, the trend of large buckles and elaborate trims was replaced by less decorated low heeled leather and felt shoes.

In the twentieth century wartime mules of the 1940s were made of lino, oilcloth, felt, compounds of raffia, rattan, bark or synthetic hemp. 1950s mules were made from plastic and decorated with feathers. The marabou mule promoted the time periods &quot;sex-kitten&quot; ideals. The styles for mules in the 1960s and in the 1980s mirrored the shoe trends of their respective decades. For the 1960s, mules had angular shapes and pointy toes. In the 1980s, this meant that mules were colorful, opulent, and highly accessorized with jewels.

=== Mules for men ===
Mules not only came in different styles and various decorations, but also can be categorized by distinct types. In the nineteenth century, two male slippers were very popular mules. In the late 1880s, a very popular version of the mule at the time in England was the Albert. In addition to the Albert, the Alfred was also a man&#x27;s boudoir, or morning slipper. This name comes from Daniel Green and Company 1892&#x27;s &quot;Alfred Dolge&#x27;s Felt Slippers and Shoes.&quot;

==Mules in the East==

Mules also appear in eastern cultures. This history is similarly rich originating from the 800s and still present today. In eighth century Egypt, mules are depicted on gravestones and seem to be made of red kid. Iranian mules from 1800 to 1889 were made of velvet, leather, silk, metal thread. They are shaped like a fish. A mule from Turkey in the Metropolitan Museum&#x27;s collection is made of wood, leather, metal, and silk. Mules from India were made from cow, buffalo or goat hide, fur, silk, wool, or cotton fiber, velvets, brocade and reeds and grass. Similar to the European examples, mules in India were embroidered and embellished with tassels and appliqué. In South Asia, a jutti is a type of shoe that is similar to the mule because it does not have backs. Sometimes, mules resemble Turkish because of the use of Near Eastern fabrics. For example, Pierre Yantorny&#x27;s mules designed for Rita de Acosta Lydig are made of an identical to other Near Eastern footwear. She potentially wore these shoes with a harem dress, further illustrating Eastern culture.

==In popular culture==
Mules have been associated with several celebrities. Queen Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I famously wore an embroidered pair of mules in the 17th century. In Édouard Manet&#x27;s 1863 painting &quot;Olympia,&quot; the central woman wears mules in bed. Her shoes connect to a type of slipper (chausson), which was slang for &quot;old prostitute&quot;. During the 1950s, iconic actresses like Marilyn Monroe, Joan Fontaine, and Jayne Russel wore the marabou mules in their films and daily lives. For example, Marilyn Monroe wore them in The Seven Year Itch. Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City frequently wore mules. In Marie Claire&#x27;s list of the top 32 Carrie Bradshaw shoes, six pairs are mules.

In 2017, many celebrities and models were sighted wearing versions of the mules. Gigi Hadid designed a mule for Stuart Weitzman&#x27;s spring 2017 collection. Beyoncé&#x27;s Instagram post of her wearing Givenchy mules received over 2 million likes. Gucci&#x27;s Princetown loafer is a version of a mule worn by both men and women. In 2015, a version of this shoe was lined with kangaroo fur, which stirred anti fur activists. These shoes were snapped on celebrities&#x27; social media platforms from Marc Jacobs to Leandra Medine of Man Repeller. In 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez, combined two major shoe trends in one mule at the Venice Film Festival.

<doc id="949958" wikidata="Q1170354" url="?curid=949958" title="Come Drink with Me">
<text>Come Drink with Me () is a 1966 Hong Kong &quot;wuxia&quot; film produced by Shaw Brothers Studio and directed by King Hu. Set during the Ming Dynasty, it stars Cheng Pei-pei, Yueh Hua and Chan Hung-lit in the leading roles, and features action choreography by Han Ying-chieh.

Considered one of the greatest wuxia films of all time, &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, and launched the career of Cheng Pei-pei as a star of the wuxia genre. It was selected as the Hong Kong entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 39th Academy Awards, but was not nominated.

==Plot==
Zheng Bi-qiu, a provincial magistrate and the son of the governor, is kidnapped by the bandit Jade-Faced Tiger. Tiger demands Zheng release his imprisoned master, but when the principled man refuses, he instead holds him for ransom: demanding to the Governor that the master be released in five days, or his son will be killed.

The Governor&#x27;s other child, a young woman known as Golden Swallow, is sent to rescue her brother. Initially disguised as a man, Golden Swallow is herself an adept swordfighter and martial artist, demonstrating her skills against Tiger&#x27;s bandits when they confront her at a local inn. 

A local beggar, known as Drunken Cat, acts as Golden Swallow&#x27;s guardian angel, covertly saving her from an ambush attempt later that night. When Golden Swallow goes to thank him the next day, he feigns ignorance, appearing only as a hedonistic drunkard collecting scraps with his army of children. However, he covertly communicates the bandits whereabouts via a coded message in a song, describing the traditional Chinese character meaning temple ().

Jade-Faced Tiger&#x27;s gang have occupied a local Buddhist monastery with the support of its corrupt abbot, Liao Kung. Golden Swallow penetrates the compound disguised as a parishioner, but is swiftly found out by Jade-Faced Tiger and forced into a confrontation. Despite her skills, she is woefully outnumbered, and narrowly escapes with her life. During the brawl, she is injured by one of Tiger&#x27;s poison-tipped darts. She is rescued in the woods by Drunken Cat, who nurses her back to health. 

While she is convalescing, Golden Swallow learns that Drunken Cat is actually Fan Da-pei, a Shaolin master and a leader of the Green Wand Kung Fu school, which he otherwise keeps a secret. Liao Kung is Fan&#x27;s blood brother, having him into the martial arts society when he was a starving orphan. Greedy for power, Liao Kung killed their master to take over the school, and sought the valuable bamboo staff that is their symbol, which Fan has obtained. Although Liao Kung claims to be the legitimate heir to the throne, as he was the most senior student, Fan maintains that his murderous deeds have negated that right. However, he is unwilling to fight his blood brother, both out of gratitude for saving his life, and because of Liao&#x27;s superior skills.

Fan negotiates a prisoner exchange between Zheng Bi-qiu and the bandits&#x27; master. However, after Bi-qiu is handed released, Fan ambushes the bandits and prevents them from releasing their leader. As the government soldiers march the bandit leader back to prison, the bandits attack the procession. Golden Swallow, leading her female warriors, manages to fight them off, killing all but Jade-Faced Tiger, who is spared at the intervention of Liao Kung. A fight with Fan ensues, and he holds his blood brother at swordpoint, demanding he reform his evil ways in exchange for his life. Liao seemingly agrees, but then later attacks Fan at his house. In their final confrontation, Fan kills Liao with their master&#x27;s bamboo staff.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;Come Drink With Me&quot; was shot on-location in Taiwan and at the Shaw Brothers Studio in Hong Kong. It was the breakthrough role for actress Cheng Pei-pei, who was only 19 years old at the time of filming. Cheng did not have a martial arts background, but was a trained ballet dancer and choreographer, which director King Hu found conducive to his style of action filmmaking.

Hu told critic Tony Rayns (quoted in Bey Logan&#x27;s book) that he had deliberately chosen a ballet dancer for the lead female role, &quot;... rather than fighting. I&#x27;m very interested in Peking opera and particularly its movement and action effects, although I think it&#x27;s difficult to express them adequately on stage, where the physical limitations are too great&quot;. King Hu was said to recognise that some of the fights are stylised as opposed to realistic but claimed that combat in his movies was &quot;always keyed to the notion of dance&quot;.

Jackie Chan is rumoured to have appeared as one of the child singers near the beginning of the film. Lead actress Cheng Pei-pei denied this in the audio commentary to the Hong Kong DVD release of the film. Still, the film is listed among Chan&#x27;s acting credits on his official website and autobiography.

== Reception ==
This film was a great success upon its release in Hong Kong and made a star of Cheng Pei-pei and others.

==Home video==
In 2003, Intercontinental Video Limited (IVL), through Celestial Pictures, released a digitally restored version of this classic film with a new trailer and interviews, including Cheng Pei-pei.

In May 2008, Dragon Dynasty released their own edition with an improved transfer, the original Mandarin mono soundtrack and exclusive supplements, including a newly recorded audio commentary with Cheng Pei-pei, trailers, and interviews with the cast (Cheng Pei-pei, Yueh Hua) and director King Hu.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Golden Swallow&quot;, was released in 1968. Cheng Pei-pei reprised her role, with Jimmy Wang Yu as her male co-star.

==Unproduced remake==
Producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein announced in April 2007 that they would invest in movies with Asian themes. One of the movies they announced was a remake of &quot;Come Drink with Me&quot;, directed by Quentin Tarantino. However, little has been heard of the project since then, and in June 2008, Tarantino announced his next project would be &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, leaving the status of the remake undisclosed.

<doc id="949960" wikidata="Q456280" url="?curid=949960" title="Telephone hybrid">
<text>In analog telephony, a telephone hybrid is the component at the ends of a subscriber line of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) that converts between two-wire and four-wire forms of bidirectional audio paths. When used in broadcast facilities to enable the airing of telephone callers, the broadcast-quality telephone hybrid is known as a broadcast telephone hybrid or telephone balance unit.

The need for hybrids comes from the nature of analog plain old telephone service (POTS) home or small business telephone lines, where the two audio directions are combined on a single two-wire pair. Within the telephone network, switching and transmission are almost always four-wire circuits with the two signals being separated. Hybrids perform the necessary conversion. In older analog networks, conversion to four-wire was required so that repeater amplifiers could be inserted in long-distance links. In today&#x27;s digital systems, each speech direction must be processed and transported independently.

The line cards in a telephone central office switch that are interfaced to analog lines include hybrids that adapt the four-wire network to the two-wire circuits that connect most subscribers.

The search for better telephone hybrids and echo cancelers (a related technology) was an important motive for the development of DSP (digital signal processing) algorithms and hardware at Bell Labs, NEC, and other sites.

==Technology==
The fundamental principle is that of impedance matching. The incoming signal is applied to both the telephone line and a &quot;balancing network&quot; that is designed to have the same impedance as the line. The outgoing signal is derived by subtracting the two, thus canceling the incoming signal from the outgoing signal. Early hybrids were made with transformers configured as hybrid coils that had an extra winding that could be connected out of phase. The name &quot;hybrid&quot; comes from these special mixed-winding transformers.

An effective hybrid would have high trans-hybrid loss, which means that relatively little of the incoming audio would appear on the outgoing port. Too much leakage can cause echoes when there is a delay in the transmission path, as there is with satellite, mobile phone, and VoIP links. This is a result of a talker&#x27;s voice traversing to the far-end hybrid and returning to his own receiver with insufficient attenuation. ITU-T Recommendation G.131 describes the relationship of echo delay vs. amplitude to listener annoyance. At 100ms, 45 dB return loss is required for less than 1% of test subjects to express dissatisfaction.

Good cancellation depends upon the balancing network having a frequency-vs.-impedance characteristic that accurately matches the line. Since telephone line impedances vary depending upon many factors and the relationship is not always smooth, analog hybrids are able to achieve only a few dB of guaranteed isolation. For this reason, modern hybrids use digital signal processing to implement an adaptive least mean squares filter that automatically detects the line&#x27;s impedance across the voice frequency range and adjusts to it. These may reach greater than 30 dB trans-hybrid loss, measured with white noise as the send signal.

DSP hybrids are also called &quot;line echo cancellers&quot; (LECs). (The phrase &quot;echo canceller&quot; in this context is misleading since there is no cancellation of echo per se but rather of leakage from the analog line interface with very short time delay more accurately characterized as phase-shift. However, any uncancelled hybrid leakage will cause echo when the associated transmission path has delay, so the effect on the system is reduction of echo.)

Hybrids and cancellers are sometimes combined with echo suppressors. These work on the assumption that usually only one of the two parties to a conversation is speaking at a given time. The suppressor switches a loss into the inactive speech path, thus enhancing the echo-cancelling effect of the hybrid at the expense of simultaneous two-way conversation.

Despite being inherently four-wire, VoIP systems require hybrids when they interface to two-wire lines. A VoIP-to-Telco gateway used to interface a VoIP PBX (private branch exchange) to analog lines would contain hybrids to perform the required conversion. End-end VoIP needs no hybrids unless adaptation to a two-wire line is required.

==Broadcast telephone hybrids==

In broadcast studio facilities, the name for the functional part has come to refer to the whole, and a telephone hybrid is the device that packages all the functions needed to connect telephone lines to studio audio systems, providing electrical and physical interface between the telco lines and studio equipment. These devices often include processing in addition to the hybrid function, such as dynamics control, filtering, and equalization (EQ). Some have dynamic EQ that adjusts parameters automatically to maintain spectral consistency from widely varying source audio. Some incorporate acoustic echo cancellation to allow setups with acoustic paths between loudspeakers carrying phone audio and microphones feeding the phone lines.

In studio applications, a hybrid needs particularly good send-to-receive isolation. When too much of the host audio appears at the hybrid&#x27;s output, there will be a number of defects. Distortion of the host&#x27;s voice can result from the telephone line&#x27;s changing the phase of the send audio before it returns, with varying shifts at different frequencies. The original and leakage audio are mixed at the console and combine in and out of phase at the various frequencies. When this occurs, the host sounds either hollow or tinny as the phase cancellation affects some frequencies more than others. Audio feedback can result from the acoustic coupling created when callers must be heard on a loudspeaker. When lines are conferenced and the gain around the loop of the multiple hybrids is greater than unity, feedback &quot;singing&quot; will be audible. If the leakage is very high, operators will not be able to control the relative levels of the host audio and the caller since the console telephone fader will affect both signals.

The digital signal processing technology used in modern hybrids addresses the isolation requirement and implements ancillary functions.
ISDN and VoIP telco connections theoretically have no need for hybrids. However, calls that have ISDN or VoIP on one end usually terminate to an analog line at the other, and so there is a significant source of echo from both the telco hybrid on the line card and the phone itself. Acoustic coupling, when the microphone picks up the output of the earpiece, is another potential source of echo. Electrical pickup between analog circuits (crosstalk) is yet another. Even low echo levels can be audible when there is a long delay, as is usually the case with VoIP.

Telephone hybrids intended for studio applications are usually rack-mount units that have RJ-style connectors for the telephone line and either balanced analog or AES3 audio inputs/outputs on XLR connectors for the studio equipment connection. One, two, or more hybrids might be packaged within a unit. There are variations to accommodate either POTS, ISDN, or VoIP telephone lines. In addition to the audio functions, hybrids can include extra capabilities such as auto-answer/disconnect, DTMF detection/generation, and Caller ID detection.

Note that telephone hybrids must be fed from the mixing console with mix-minus to avoid feedback.

Some inexpensive adapters connect between a telephone and its handset, with a button to activate either the handset or the adapter. These are simple passive devices that pass the audio from the telephone without processing.

At the other end of the spectrum are systems that can handle multiple lines and connect to a computer so that a producer can follow who is on which line, communicate with the host, and manage the order of taking calls.

Telephone hybrids are also used to interface production intercom systems to the PSTN.

POTS codecs, ISDN codecs, and IP codecs are used for remote broadcasts when it is possible to have specialized equipment at both ends of the connection. POTS codecs work with analog lines, ISDN codecs with ISDN lines, and IP codecs with any link that can provide IP connectivity. These employ audio data compression and decompression at each end. Audio bandwidths up to 20 kHz can be achieved this way. Compression is often via MPEG MP3 or AAC.

<text>40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, sometimes shortened to 40 Acres, is an American production company founded by filmmakers Spike Lee and Monty Ross in 1979. It has produced all of Lee&#x27;s films.

==History==
The company&#x27;s name is a reference to forty acres and a mule, a section of military orders during the American Civil War which stated that certain recently emancipated black families on the Georgia coast were to be given some surplus army mules and lots of land no larger than . The company&#x27;s logo contains a circle with the icon &quot;40a&quot; and it has occasionally used a parody of the Mark VII Limited logo.

The company has produced all of Lee&#x27;s films, starting in 1986 with &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;. After the success of his films &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, Lee expanded the company&#x27;s brand by opening clothing stores featuring its merchandise.

40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks has an advertising division with DDB called Spike DDB located in New York City. They have done Super Bowl, Nike, Lay&#x27;s, and Eckō Unltd. commercial spots. They have produced commercials and music videos in addition to Lee&#x27;s films. The company established a music branch, used to designate records, 40 Acres and a Mule Musicworks in 1993.

In the late 1980s, the company sought a partnership with Universal Pictures, which was reupped in September 1992, and stayed on for five years, which lasted until March 2, 1997, when it was moved to Columbia Pictures. Sam Kitt was named president of production at the Sony-based studio on June 18, 1997.

In 2004, the company moved all of its operations to New York City with headquarters on South Elliott Place in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. In 2010, Lee&#x27;s documentary &quot;If God Is Willing and Da Creek Don&#x27;t Rise&quot; won a Peabody Award. In 2021, the company had signed a multi-year creative partnership with Netflix to develop their film and television projects.

<text>In artificial intelligence and operations research, constraint satisfaction is the process of finding a solution through 
a set of constraints that impose conditions that the variables must satisfy. A solution is therefore an assignment of values to the variables that satisfies all constraints—that is, a point in the feasible region.

The techniques used in constraint satisfaction depend on the kind of constraints being considered. Often used are constraints on a finite domain, to the point that constraint satisfaction problems are typically identified with problems based on constraints on a finite domain. Such problems are usually solved via search, in particular a form of backtracking or local search. Constraint propagation is another family of methods used on such problems; most of them are incomplete in general, that is, they may solve the problem or prove it unsatisfiable, but not always. Constraint propagation methods are also used in conjunction with search to make a given problem simpler to solve. Other considered kinds of constraints are on real or rational numbers; solving problems on these constraints is done via variable elimination or the simplex algorithm.

Constraint satisfaction as a general problem originated in the field of artificial intelligence in the 1970s (see for example ). However, when the constraints are expressed as multivariate linear equations defining (in)equalities, the field goes back to Joseph Fourier in the 19th century: George Dantzig&#x27;s invention of the simplex algorithm for linear programming (a special case of mathematical optimization) in 1946 has allowed determining feasible solutions to problems containing hundreds of variables.

During the 1980s and 1990s, embedding of constraints into a programming language was developed. The first language devised expressly with intrinsic support for constraint programming was Prolog. Since then, constraint-programming libraries have become available in other languages, such as C++ or Java (e.g., Choco for Java).

==Constraint satisfaction problem==
As originally defined in artificial intelligence, constraints enumerate the possible values a set of variables may take in a given world. A possible world is a total assignment of values to variables representing a way the world (real or imaginary) could be. Informally, a finite domain is a finite set of arbitrary elements. A constraint satisfaction problem on such domain contains a set of variables whose values can only be taken from the domain, and a set of constraints, each constraint specifying the allowed values for a group of variables. A solution to this problem is an evaluation of the variables that satisfies all constraints. In other words, a solution is a way for assigning a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied by these values.

In some circumstances, there may exist additional requirements: one may be interested not only in the solution (and in the fastest or most computationally efficient way to reach it) but in how it was reached; e.g. one may want the &quot;simplest&quot; solution (&quot;simplest&quot; in a logical, non-computational sense that has to be precisely defined). This is often the case in logic games such as Sudoku.

In practice, constraints are often expressed in compact form, rather than enumerating all the values of the variables that would satisfy the constraint. One of the most-used constraints is the (obvious) one establishing that the values of the affected variables must be all different.

Problems that can be expressed as constraint satisfaction problems are the eight queens puzzle, the Sudoku solving problem and many other logic puzzles, the Boolean satisfiability problem, scheduling problems, bounded-error estimation problems and various problems on graphs such as the graph coloring problem.

While usually not included in the above definition of a constraint satisfaction problem, arithmetic equations and inequalities bound the values of the variables they contain and can therefore be considered a form of constraints. Their domain is the set of numbers (either integer, rational, or real), which is infinite: therefore, the relations of these constraints may be infinite as well; for example, formula_1 has an infinite number of pairs of satisfying values. Arithmetic equations and inequalities are often not considered within the definition of a &quot;constraint satisfaction problem&quot;, which is limited to finite domains. They are however used often in constraint programming.

It can be shown that the arithmetic inequalities or equations present in some types of finite logic puzzles such as Futoshiki or Kakuro (also known as Cross Sums) can be dealt with as non-arithmetic constraints (see &quot;Pattern-Based Constraint Satisfaction and Logic Puzzles&quot;).

===Solving===

Constraint satisfaction problems on finite domains are typically solved using a form of search. The most-used techniques are variants of backtracking, constraint propagation, and local search. These techniques are used on problems with nonlinear constraints.

Variable elimination and the simplex algorithm are used for solving linear and polynomial equations and inequalities, and problems containing variables with infinite domain. These are typically solved as optimization problems in which the optimized function is the number of violated constraints.

===Complexity===
Solving a constraint satisfaction problem on a finite domain is an NP-complete problem with respect to the domain size. Research has shown a number of tractable subcases, some limiting the allowed constraint relations, some requiring the scopes of constraints to form a tree, possibly in a reformulated version of the problem. Research has also established relationships of the constraint satisfaction problem with problems in other areas such as finite model theory.

==Constraint programming==
Constraint programming is the use of constraints as a programming language to encode and solve problems. This is often done by embedding constraints into a programming language, which is called the host language. Constraint programming originated from a formalization of equalities of terms in Prolog II, leading to a general framework for embedding constraints into a logic programming language. The most common host languages are Prolog, C++, and Java, but other languages have been used as well.

===Constraint logic programming===
A constraint logic program is a logic program that contains constraints in the bodies of clauses. As an example, the clause codice_1 is a clause containing the constraint codice_2 in the body. Constraints can also be present in the goal. The constraints in the goal and in the clauses used to prove the goal are accumulated into a set called constraint store. This set contains the constraints the interpreter has assumed satisfiable in order to proceed in the evaluation. As a result, if this set is detected unsatisfiable, the interpreter backtracks. Equations of terms, as used in logic programming, are considered a particular form of constraints, which can be simplified using unification. As a result, the constraint store can be considered an extension of the concept of substitution that is used in regular logic programming. The most common kinds of constraints used in constraint logic programming are constraints over integers/rational/real numbers and constraints over finite domains.

Concurrent constraint logic programming languages have also been developed. They significantly differ from non-concurrent constraint logic programming in that they are aimed at programming concurrent processes that may not terminate. Constraint handling rules can be seen as a form of concurrent constraint logic programming, but are also sometimes used within a non-concurrent constraint logic programming language. They allow for rewriting constraints or to infer new ones based on the truth of conditions.

===Constraint satisfaction toolkits===

Constraint satisfaction toolkits are software libraries for imperative programming languages that are used to encode and solve a constraint satisfaction problem.

* Cassowary constraint solver, an open source project for constraint satisfaction (accessible from C, Java, Python and other languages).
* Comet, a commercial programming language and toolkit
* Gecode, an open source portable toolkit written in C++ developed as a production-quality and highly efficient implementation of a complete theoretical background.
* Gelisp, an open source portable wrapper of Gecode to Lisp. http://gelisp.sourceforge.net/
* IBM ILOG CP Optimizer: C++, Python, Java, .NET libraries (proprietary, free for academic use). Successor of ILOG Solver/Scheduler, which was considered the market leader in commercial constraint programming software as of 2006
* JaCoP, an open source Java constraint solver.
* Koalog, a commercial Java-based constraint solver.
* logilab-constraint, an open source constraint solver written in pure Python with constraint propagation algorithms.
* Minion, an open-source constraint solver written in C++, with a small language for the purpose of specifying models/problems.
* ZDC, an open source program developed in the Computer-Aided Constraint Satisfaction Project for modelling and solving constraint satisfaction problems.

===Other constraint programming languages===

Constraint toolkits are a way for embedding constraints into an imperative programming language. However, they are only used as external libraries for encoding and solving problems. An approach in which constraints are integrated into an imperative programming language is taken in the Kaleidoscope programming language.

Constraints have also been embedded into functional programming languages.

<text>Bayawan, officially the City of Bayawan (), is a component city in the province of Negros Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 122,747 people.

Bayawan used to be known as New Tolong, and only had its modern name starting 1952.

Bayawan became a chartered city in December 2000. It boasts its distinction as a &quot;Character City&quot; (International Association of Character Cities) and a pioneer &quot;Healthy City&quot; (DOH certified) in the Philippines. The Asian Institute of Management recognized the city as &quot;one of the Top 10 Best Cities to Live In in the Philippines (Small Cities Category)&quot; under its Competitive Cities Survey of 2007.

The town is home to the &quot;Minagahat language&quot;, the Indigenous language of Southern Negros as listed by Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino. The language is vital to the culture and arts of the people of southern Negros.

== Etymology ==
An altercation happened between a priest and the natives that used to live in the area. The town center was previously located in an uphill settlement called &#x27;Omod&#x27;, and a chapel was erected to serve the religious needs of the new converts. During a mass, a native threw a lance in the priest, who was raising the Holy Host at that time, instantly killing him.

The name &quot;Bayawan&quot; stems from the Visayan term &quot;Bayaw&quot;– to hoist or elevate, in reference to the priest&#x27;s action just before his death.

==History==
It was in 1751 when the Spanish friars first established their settlement. 116 years later, Tolong Nuevo (Bayawan&#x27;s former name) had existed as early as 1868 as part of Tolong Viejo (now the Municipality of Santa Catalina). It was not until 1872 when she was formally organized as a pueblo.

In 1953, the name Tolong Nuevo was changed to Bayawan, by virtue of Republic Act 694 as approved by the 3rd congress of the Philippines, consigning the name “Tolong” into obscurity and deep oblivion soon slowly to be forgotten by the succeeding generations. This made Bayawan a separate municipality.

===Cityhood===

Bayawan, after meeting all of its requirements for its cityhood, became a city on December 23, 2000, via plebiscite that was set by COMELEC.

==Geography==
Bayawan is located from the provincial capital Dumaguete and from Kabankalan. It is a coastal city with a land area of , the largest in the province and whole Negros island. This accounts for 13% of the province&#x27;s land area. Mabinay bounds it to the north, Santa Catalina to the south, Tanjay to the east, Basay to the west, and it also shares a boundary with Kabankalan of Negros Occidental on the northwest. The coastline is west to east, with 7 coastal barangays.

Bayawan City is subdivided into three development zones:
*The urban area constitutes only 2.3% (15.73 km2) of the city&#x27;s total area and contains the main institutional, commercial and central business district of the city. It functions as the main economic hub, while economic growth nodes are established in strategically located barangays in the hinterlands.
*The sub-urban area is about 14.7% (102.6 km2) of the total area and is set to contain the agro-industrial zones, industrial zones and human settlements. The existing industrial activity (lime plant), the establishment of saw mills, and the identified industrial zones in the area show the natural pattern of development. Residential zones are considered in the sub-urban area to provide settlements for the people in the commercial center and in the industrial zones.
*The rural area accounts for 83.1% of the total land area and is basically agricultural. However, some barangays are identified to contain a high level of commerce, trade and agro-processing industry being the economic growth nodes of the city. These growth nodes are singled out due to their strategic geographic location while other rural barangays are mainly agricultural production areas.

===Barangays===
Bayawan is politically subdivided into 28 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

Kalumboyan was formerly a sitio of Nangka, while Balabag (now Villareal) was a sitio of Manihihon. They were converted into independent barrios in 1955.











===Climate===
Under the Modified Coronas&#x27; Climate Classification system, Bayawan has two distinct climate seasons: the dry season, well pronounced in the months of January to May; and the wet season, in the months of June to December.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, the city has a population of 122,747.

In 2000, 21,814 of 101,391 inhabitants of the city comprise the urban population. The population density is 180/km2, which is manageable compared to other cities in the country.

==Economy==

Bayawan is more of the rural setting than urbanized with only 2.25% of its total land area as urban area. The city is basically agricultural and its economy sits on an agricultural platform. Revenues from land farming, livestock production, aqua-culture activities and marine fishing are a major income contribution of the city. In 2000, the assessment of City Agriculture Office (CAO) indicated that agricultural production was valued at Php 2.3 Billion; 91.4% of which came from crop production, 7.9% from livestock production, and 0.7% from fisheries.

On a general scale, the city is not yet self-sufficient since its local revenue is only 12% of the total revenue and 88% comes from its Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) (Year 2000 Data).

The City however has several investment opportunities especially in the field of agro-industry and processing as well as in the processing of marine products. The vast agricultural resources and the LGU&#x27;s thrust on agricultural development opens avenues of investing in feed mills, palm oil mills, rice mills, corn mills, storage and other farming and post harvest facilities and equipment. Besides agri-industries, the trading and auction markets are already well established in the hinterland barangays especially in Dawis and Kalumboyan. Moreover, the fishery industry and aqua-culture also offers wide business opportunities especially in the establishment of the proposed fishing port.

Another window for investors is in the transportation system. With the opening of the Bayawan-Kabankalan Road Network, more transport facilities will be required. The city is already recognized as a transport hub in South Negros, and planned to be enhanced further with improvement of the road network.

Currently, the people in the city are engaged in self-employment activities such as farming, fishing, trading or buying &amp; selling activities. Resident professionals in the city are in abundance however majority often migrate seeking employment opportunities.

Puregold Bayawan opened last November 2019 as the first full-service mall in the city.

==Environment==

Bayawan has one of the most barren mountains in the province. The Department of Environment &amp; Natural Resources (DENR) have classified that 72.7% and 27.3% (198.05 km2) of the total land area of Bayawan as A&amp;D (alienable and disposable) and as forestlands respectively. However, recent assessment of land use utilization shows that only 17.8% of the total land area is used as forestlands. From these, it can be deduced that a large portion of the land area supposedly classified as forestlands are cultivated and unsuitably used. This situation can be attributed to the improper settling and farming practices of the people in the hinterlands. There are uncontrolled and unmonitored conversions of classified forestlands through slash and burn practices, then cultivation by the people in all parts of the upland barangays. However, these lands have or in the process of application for land titles (ownership).

The haphazard conversion and cultivation of the forestlands and denudation of the forest cover have resulted to the perennial problem of flooding in both upland and lowland barangays during rainy season. Its adverse effects include the severe siltation of the three rivers in the city and loss of soil fertility in the hinterlands due to soil erosion and landslides. In addition, some springs has become intermittent (no water flowing during dry season) because of the destruction of their watersheds.

In terms of sanitary sewerage and solid waste disposal, only the urban barangays have established sewerage in the city, however, the system drains directly into the rivers or directly into the sea without wastewater treatment. Other households utilize backyard septic tanks for their wastewater disposal. Solid wastes are collected by the LGU in the urban barangays and dumped into an open dumpsite in Barangay Banga. In anticipation for more solid wastes in the future as development spins in the city, a new dumping site was acquired in Barangay Nangka.

==Tourism==

* Niludhan Fals
* Banay Banay Falls
* Lourdes Falls
* Bayawan Boulevard
* Bayawan City Plaza
* Bayawan Nature Reserve 
* Narra Water Park
* Bayawan City Waste Management and Ecological Center

==Infrastructure==
The main infrastructure of the city is concentrated in the city proper, although various dams for agricultural purposes have been constructed to improve irrigation in the farmlands. The connecting road to Kabankalan City is also nearing completion. The 2.5 kilometers long boulevard fronting the beachfront in the city proper is among the longest in the province, and has become a major local venue as well as a tourist attraction.

===Transport===
As of 2000 the city had 645.23 km of roads; 6.26% of which are National Roads; 19.41% are Provincial Roads; 1.79% are City Roads/Streets; and majority of which is 72.54% are Barangay Roads. Moreover, of the total road length only 5.75% are concrete roads and 2.81% asphalt roads. Of the unpaved roads, only 105 kilometers are gravel roads and the remaining 75.16% or 485 kilometers are earth fill roads. This translates that most of the roads especially the barangay roads in the upland barangays are not passable during bad weather conditions. The road situation affected for the residents in the hinterlands and the farmers have to shoulder very high cost of transporting their products.

The improvement of road infrastructure of the city especially the provincial road that connects the City Proper, Kalumboyan and Manduao to the City of Kabankalan in Negros Occidental is deemed to open up a new dimension in the economic and social activity of the city. The improvement of the city&#x27;s transport route to Mabinay and towards the Cities of Tanjay and Bais is recently seen to be apparent.

===Bridges and spillways===
There are 13 bridges with a total length of 494.95 meters that provide passengers over the different rivers or creeks in the city. Ten of these bridges are made of reinforced concrete, having a total length of 287.15 meters. Among these, seven with a total length of 277.85 meters are classified as National bridges and two with total length of 9.3 meters as Barangay. One is made of reinforced concrete with steel frame with a length of 175.7 meters and classified as National. Two (2) Barangay bridges with a total length of 32.1 meters are made of wood with steel bracing for pedestrian use.

One bridge (Milagrosa Bridge) located in Sitio Milagrosa Barangay Nangka is totally damaged. It is to be converted into a spillway.

Hugno Footbridge is a proposed bridge located in Hugno, Barangay Nangka.

There are 52 spillways present in different Barangays. Only 18 spillways were in excellent condition. Fourteen need improvement, repair, and to be developed. Two to be replaced with a bridge, seven need to be replaced, three were proposed, six to be re-constructed, and two were damaged and needs re-construction.

Generally, the inland barangays only have Level I (developed source) water system or Level II (communal waterworks) have just been recently established in Barangay Tabuan through BIARSP which is 1.6 million project. Only Barangay Nangka and Kalumboyan have level III water system that only the bario proper is being served, when there are no waterworks in the area especially as in the case in sitios the usual water sources are dug wells or springs.

In this aspect, the city has formulated policies and work programs to address the water problems of the city. To address the needs in the barangay, water sources are assessed and projects are outlined such that potable water can be conveyed into every household. New water sources (such as the Danapa Spring in Nangka) are looked into for feasible development into a water supply infrastructure project so that the water needs of the city&#x27;s households, industries and commercial sectors will be met.

===Flood control and drainage===

The city proper of Bayawan experiences flooding during rainy season. The existing sewerage/drainage system is still inadequate and unable to effectively drain rainwater especially during strong typhoons. A reinforced concrete wharf located in Barangay Ubos and Suba along the Bayawan River, having a length of 326 meters served as a flood control structure. This structure is to hold the water especially during high tides and strong typhoons from coming/ flowing into the City Proper. This flood control mechanism however also needs improvement especially that the carrying capacity of the Bayawan River has been immensely reduced from its siltation.

Along the Coastal Margin (Pagatban, Malabugas, Banga and Villareal) and even in the upland barangays with low-lying built-up areas (such Minaba, Kalumboyan and Tabuan), flooding is also a perennial issue since there are no established drainage infrastructure projects in these barangays.

Identified short-term solutions of flooding include the proper maintenance and repair of existing infrastructure and the expansion of construction projects. Well-thought of, effective and efficient drainage design and work programs are yet to be created. The long-term solution will include the effective rehabilitation of the watershed areas, reforestation, ripropping of riverbanks and maintenance of river easements such that soil erosion and subsequent siltation of the rivers will be reduced if not eliminated. This entails long-term integrated (multi-sectoral) and environment-focused planning, sound policy-making, strong political will and support, effective law enforcement, and vigilant monitoring.

Various command irrigation projects are now being implemented by the National Irragation Authority (NIA). Among these are the Tabuan Communal Irrigation Project (CIP), Mantapi CIP and the upper/ lower Malabugas CIP of which the LGU have provided a Php 1 million equity per projects. Moreover, the LGU have allocated Php 22.02 million as counterpart for the proposed Bayawan CIP which has a total project cost of Php 130.47 million. The Bayawan CIP is among the priority projects of the 10 year Bayawan Urban Infrastructure Development Plan.

Making cities safe from disaster is everybody&#x27;s business. Equally Bayawan in its crossroad of development, being efficient and effective not only through environmental management, administrative processes, infrastructure and business, but particularly on disaster preparedness. With the increase in localized disasters has necessitated a corresponding increase in disaster preparedness and response capacity at the community and local government levels. The presence of early warning systems &quot;(LFEWS)&quot; linked to the Disaster Risk Reduction to provide accurate and timely advice to Barangay emergency response organizations.

===Power===
The source of power of the city is the Palinpinon Geothermal Power Plant and is delivered through the Negros Oriental II Electric Cooperative (NORECO II). In spite of the relatively close proximity of the city to and abundance of the power source, only 16.64% of the total number of households in the whole city are energized. Most of the households served are located in the urban areas. At present, NORECO II have served 4,106 household out of a potential 18,623 subscribers in the city. The energized household are those of the urban barangays and some rural barangays namely Malabugas, Pagatban, Nangka, San Roque, San Miguel, Minaba Tayawan, Tabuan, Dawis, Kalumboyan, Ali-is, Narra.

The low level of energization in the city can be directly attributed to the existing road conditions. It follows that the unfavorable road conditions make the installation of power infrastructures difficult. Besides, the current standard of living of the people in the hinterlands (which is way below the poverty level) does not provide an encouraging market for the electric Service provider. The low energization level of the City does not require much solution on finding of power sources or the installation of electrical infrastructures but more on improving the road conditions and finding socio-economic solutions.

===Telecommunications===
The city has telephone services, cellular mobile telephone services, wireless local coop services, satellite communication, print media, broadcast media (radio), telegraph/ telegram, postal services and fast courier delivery services provided for the public. The onset of fast and modern communication facilities resulted to the gradual phase-out of the traditional means of communication in the city.

Telecommunications in the city is along the current trends although more expansion and promotion is needed. The city has three telephone service companies: PLDT, Cruztelco and Globe Telecom. Cruztelco being the pioneer telephone company in the city has 400 lines installed and have an existing 131 subscribers. PLDT has 1,200 cables installed and an existing 616 subscribers and 122 potential subscribers with pending application. A cell site of Smart Communications is also in operation. National and provincial dailies and periodicals are delivered and available in the city. Also, the Local Government Unit (LGU) of Bayawan circulates copies of GABAYAN, an official newsletter of the city, every quarter. Radio and Television are the broadcast media available in the city. Radio Natin has broadcast coverage up to the Municipalities of Santa Catalina, Basay, Pamplona, and Siaton. Television cable networks E &amp; E Cable TV and Fil Products Cable TV operates in the city. Broadband internet access is also widely available from numerous internet cafes within the city proper. DOTC public calling stations exist in Barangay Nangka, Maninihon, San Roque and Dawis.

===Housing===
There are two Housing Projects owned by private developers—with an expected total units of 663 houses. The LGU has begun implementing low cost housing projects, starting with Fishermen&#x27;s Village in Tawi-Tawi. Resettlement areas will be provided for the Informal Settlers within the urban area.

==Education==
Bayawan City has three tertiary institutions, the Negros Oriental State University (formerly NONAS), Bayawan College (now defunct) and Southern Tech College. Nursery education is provided by day-care centers located in each urban barangay.

The public schools in Bayawan are administered by the Schools Division of Bayawan City.

<text>Gobabis (, ) is a town in eastern Namibia. It is the regional capital of the Omaheke Region, and the district capital of the Gobabis electoral constituency. Gobabis is in the heart of the cattle farming area. It had a population of 33,418 people in 2023. 

==History==

===Etymology and pre-colonial history===
The area around Gobabis and along the Nossob River had a strong population of elephants. The settlement itself was a base camp for ivory hunters and a trading post for elephant tusks.

In 1856 a mission station was established by one Friederich Eggert of the Rhenish Missionary Society. In the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century several conflicts flared up between the Ovambanderu and the Khauas Khoikhoi, as well as between the settlers and the indigenous people. Gobabis is in an area where the Herero and the Nama people fought wars against one another, as well as with settlers from the Cape colony that occupied the land.

According to oral tradition, the earliest name for the settlement in this area was the Khoekhoegowab word ǂKhoandabes, &quot;the place where the elephant came to lick&quot;. The reason for this name is speculated to be that elephant tusks that would crack in the dry and hot climate of the Omaheke were at times stored right in the settlement&#x27;s well. The Herero called the place &quot;Epako&quot;.

Later the settlement was referred to as &quot;Gobabis&quot; by the Whites, this expression was likely derived from goba (argue, quarrel) and bis (place): &quot;The place where people quarreled&quot;. A common earlier interpretation of the name, ǂkhoa (Elephant) -bes (place), &quot;Elephant fountain&quot;, was introduced by Heinrich Vedder and gained wide acceptance. Vedder also opined that it was Amraal Lambert, Captain of the Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) who called the place Gobabis because he could not pronounce &quot;ǂKoabes&quot;. Apart from linguistic problems, this interpretation was contradicted by an 1845 letter by Reverend Joseph Tindall, a Wesleyan missionary, which states: &quot;Reached Gobabis which I named &#x27;Elephant&#x27;s fountain&#x27;&quot; - a place name like &quot;Place of Altercation&quot; would not bode too well for the missionary station he intended to establish.

===Colonial===
The Gobabis district was proclaimed by the German authorities in February 1894 and in June the following year Gobabis was occupied by a German garrison. While the military fort, built in 1896–7, has long since disappeared, one of the few buildings dating back to that era is the field hospital, or Lazarett, which has been declared a national monument.

==Geography==
Gobabis is situated down the B6 motorway from Windhoek to Botswana. The town is from the Buitepos border post with Botswana, and serves as an important link to South Africa on the tarred Trans-Kalahari Highway. Gobabis also has its own local airport. 

===Demographics===
===Climate===
Gobabis has a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with hot summers and cool winters (with mild days and chilly nights). The average annual precipitation is .

==Economy and infrastructure==
Gobabis is in the heart of the cattle farming area. A statue of a large Brahman bull with the inscription &quot;Cattle Country&quot; greets visitors to the town.

Gobabis continues to grow as a town due to goods being transported from the mines of landlocked Botswana to the Namibian port of Walvis Bay, and furthermore from consumer goods being imported into Namibia from Gauteng in South Africa. The transport route is known as the Trans-Kalahari Corridor. Gobabis is connected to the Namibian railway system. The passenger train that used to run to the capital Windhoek four times a week, no longer takes passengers. The town hosts a state hospital, a state clinic and a private hospital, banking and shopping facilities. Legare Stadium is located in the town.

==Politics==
===Local===
Gobabis is governed by a municipal council that has seven seats. The town has its own local party, the Gobabis Residents&#x27; Association (GRA) which won three council seats in the 1998 local authority election and one seat in 2004.

The 2015 local authority election was won by SWAPO which gained 3,077 votes and five seats. One seat each was won by the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 682 votes) and the National Unity Democratic Organisation (NUDO, 153 votes). SWAPO also won the 2020 local authority election but lost majority control over the municipal council. It obtained 1,986 votes and gained three seats. One seat each went to the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 818 votes), the GRA (681 votes), NUDO (440 votes) and the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM), formerly DTA, with 338 votes.

===Regional===
Gobabis is the regional capital of the Omaheke Region. Gobabis Constituency covers most of the town area except for its eastern township of Nossobville which belongs to the Kalahari Constituency. 

==Education==
Gobabis is home to Wennie du Plessis Secondary School, which began as an Afrikaans-medium school. With the government abolition of non-English education after grade 4 at independence, the Afrikaans speaking community endeavoured to start a private school, and the Gobabis Gymnasium came into existence in January 2000 with 67 students from grades 8 to 11 and 6 teachers. In January 2002, 122 students were enrolled, and on December 2, 2004, the school was registered to teach grades 1 through 12. Primary school education officially was started in January 2005.

The Omaheke Regional Library is situated in town between the Epako suburb and Legare Stadium.

<text>Evolution-Data Optimized (EV-DO, EVDO, etc.) is a telecommunications standard for the wireless transmission of data through radio signals, typically for broadband Internet access. EV-DO is an evolution of the CDMA2000 (IS-2000) standard which supports high data rates and can be deployed alongside a wireless carrier&#x27;s voice services. It uses advanced multiplexing techniques including code-division multiple access (CDMA) as well as time-division multiplexing (TDM) to maximize throughput. It is a part of the CDMA2000 family of standards and has been adopted by many mobile phone service providers around the world particularly those previously employing CDMA networks. It is also used on the Globalstar satellite phone network.

An EV-DO channel has a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, the same bandwidth size that IS-95A (IS-95) and IS-2000 (1xRTT) use, though the channel structure is very different. The back-end network is entirely packet-based, and is not constrained by restrictions typically present on a circuit switched network.

The EV-DO feature of CDMA2000 networks provides access to mobile devices with forward link air interface speeds of up to 2.4 Mbit/s with Rel. 0 and up to 3.1 Mbit/s with Rev. A. The reverse link rate for Rel. 0 can operate up to 153 kbit/s, while Rev. A can operate at up to 1.8 Mbit/s. It was designed to be operated end-to-end as an IP-based network, and can support any application which can operate on such a network and bit rate constraints.

== Standard revisions ==
There have been several revisions of the standard, starting with Release 0 (Rel. 0). This was later expanded upon with Revision A (Rev. A) to support quality of service (to improve latency) and higher rates on the forward and reverse link. In late 2006, Revision B (Rev. B) was published, whose features include the ability to bundle multiple carriers to achieve even higher rates and lower latencies (see TIA-856 Rev. B below). The upgrade from EV-DO Rev. A to Rev. B involves a software update of the cell site modem, and additional equipment for new EV-DO carriers. Existing cdma2000 operators may have to retune some of their existing 1xRTT channels to other frequencies, as Rev. B requires all DO carriers be within 5 MHz.

=== EV-DO Rel. 0 (TIA-856 Release 0) ===
The initial design of EV-DO was developed by Qualcomm in 1999 to meet IMT-2000 requirements for a greater-than-2 Mbit/s down link for stationary communications, as opposed to mobile communication (i.e., moving cellular phone service). Initially, the standard was called High Data Rate (HDR), but was renamed to 1xEV-DO after it was ratified by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) under the designation TIA-856. Originally, 1xEV-DO stood for &quot;1x Evolution-Data Only&quot;, referring to its being a direct evolution of the 1x (1xRTT) air interface standard, with its channels carrying only data traffic. The title of the 1xEV-DO standard document is &quot;cdma2000 High Rate Packet Data Air Interface Specification&quot;, as cdma2000 (lowercase) is another name for the 1x standard, numerically designated as TIA-2000.

Later, due to possible negative connotations of the word &quot;only&quot;, the &quot;DO&quot;-part of the standard&#x27;s name 1xEV-DO was changed to stand for &quot;Data Optimized&quot;, the full name - EV-DO now stands for &quot;Evolution-Data Optimized.&quot; The 1x prefix has been dropped by many of the major carriers, and is marketed simply as EV-DO. This provides a more market-friendly emphasis of the technology being data-optimized.

==== Forward link channel structure ====
The primary characteristic that differentiates an EV-DO channel from a 1xRTT channel is that it is time multiplexed on the forward link (from the tower to the mobile). This means that a single mobile has full use of the forward traffic channel within a particular geographic area (a sector) during a given slot of time. Using this technique, EV-DO is able to modulate each user’s time slot independently. This allows the service of users in favorable RF conditions with very complex modulation techniques while also serving users in poor RF conditions with simpler (and more redundant) signals.

The forward channel is divided into slots, each being 1.667 ms long. In addition to user traffic, overhead channels are interlaced into the stream, which include the &#x27;pilot&#x27;, which helps the mobile find and identify the channel, the Media Access Channel (MAC) which tells the mobile devices when their data is scheduled, and the &#x27;control channel&#x27;, which contains other information the network needs the mobile devices to know.

The modulation to be used to communicate with a given mobile unit is determined by the mobile device itself; it listens to the traffic on the channel, and depending on the receive signal strength along with the perceived multi-path and fading conditions, makes a best guess as to what data-rate it can sustain while maintaining a reasonable frame error rate of 1-2%. It then communicates this information back to the serving sector in the form of an integer between 1 and 12 on the &quot;Digital Rate Control&quot; (DRC) channel. Alternatively, the mobile can select a &quot;null&quot; rate (DRC 0), indicating that the mobile either cannot decode data at any rate, or that it is attempting to hand off to another serving sector.

The DRC values are as follows:

Another important aspect of the EV-DO forward link channel is the scheduler. The scheduler most commonly used is called &quot;proportional fair&quot;. It&#x27;s designed to maximize sector throughput while also guaranteeing each user a certain minimum level of service. The idea is to schedule mobiles reporting higher DRC indices more often, with the hope that those reporting worse conditions will improve in time.

The system also incorporates Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ. Each sub-packet of a multi-slot transmission is a turbo-coded replica of the original data bits. This allows mobiles to acknowledge a packet before all of its sub-sections have been transmitted. For example, if a mobile transmits a DRC index of 3 and is scheduled to receive data, it will expect to get data during four time slots. If after decoding the first slot the mobile is able to determine the entire data packet, it can send an early acknowledgement back at that time; the remaining three sub-packets will be cancelled. If however the packet is not acknowledged, the network will proceed with the transmission of the remaining parts until all have been transmitted or the packet is acknowledged.

==== Reverse link structure ====
The reverse link (from the mobile back to the Base Transceiver Station) on EV-DO Rel. 0 operates very similar to that of CDMA2000 1xRTT. The channel includes a reverse link pilot (helps with decoding the signal) along with the user data channels. Some additional channels that do not exist in 1x include the DRC channel (described above) and the ACK channel (used for HARQ). Only the reverse link has any sort of power control, because the forward link is always transmitted at full power for use by all the mobiles. The reverse link has both open loop and closed loop power control. In the open loop, the reverse link transmission power is set based upon the received power on the forward link. In the closed loop, the reverse link power is adjusted up or down 800 times a second, as indicated by the serving sector (similar to 1x).

All of the reverse link channels are combined using code division and transmitted back to the base station using BPSK where they are decoded. The maximum speed available for user data is 153.2 kbit/s, but in real-life conditions this is rarely achieved. Typical speeds achieved are between 20-50 kbit/s.

=== EV-DO Rev. A (TIA-856 Revision A) ===
Revision A of EV-DO makes several additions to the protocol while keeping it completely backwards compatible with Release 0.

These changes included the introduction of several new forward link data rates that increase the maximum burst rate from 2.45 Mbit/s to 3.1 Mbit/s. Also included were protocols that would decrease connection establishment time (called enhanced access channel MAC), the ability for more than one mobile to share the same timeslot (multi-user packets) and the introduction of QoS flags. All of these were put in place to allow for low latency, low bit rate communications such as VoIP.

The additional forward rates for EV-DO Rev. An are:

In addition to the changes on the forward link, the reverse link was enhanced to support higher complexity modulation (and thus higher bit rates). An optional secondary pilot was added, which is activated by the mobile when it tries to achieve enhanced data rates. To combat reverse link congestion and noise rise, the protocol calls for each mobile to be given an interference allowance which is replenished by the network when the reverse link conditions allow it. The reverse link has a maximum rate of 1.8 Mbit/s, but under normal conditions users experience a rate of approximately 500-1000 Kbit/s but with more latency than DOCSIS and DSL.

=== EV-DO Rev. B (TIA-856 Revision B) ===
EV-DO Rev. B is a multi-carrier evolution of the Rev. A specification. It maintains the capabilities of EV-DO Rev. A, and provides the following enhancements:
* Higher rates per carrier (up to 4.9 Mbit/s on the downlink per carrier). Typical deployments are expected to include 2 or 3 carriers for a peak rate of 14.7 Mbit/s. Higher rates by bundling multiple channels together enhance the user experience and enable new services such as high definition video streaming.
* Reduced latency by using statistical multiplexing across channels—enhances the experience for latency sensitive services such as gaming, video telephony, remote console sessions and web browsing.
* Increased talk-time and standby time
* Reduced interference from the adjacent sectors especially to users at the edge of the cell signal which improves the rates that can be offered by using Hybrid frequency re-use.
* Efficient support for services that have asymmetric download and upload requirements (i.e. different data rates required in each direction) such as file transfers, web browsing, and broadband multimedia content delivery.

=== EV-DO Rev. C (TIA-856 Revision C) and TIA-1121 === 

Qualcomm early on realized that EV-DO was a stop-gap solution, and foresaw an upcoming format war between LTE and determined that a new standard would be needed. Qualcomm originally called this technology EV-DV (Evolution Data and Voice). As EV-DO became more pervasive, EV-DV evolved into EV-DO Rev C.

The EV-DO Rev. C standard was specified by 3GPP2 to improve the CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications and requirements. It was proposed by Qualcomm as the natural evolution path for CDMA2000 and the specifications were published by 3GPP2 (C.S0084-*) and TIA (TIA-1121) in 2007 and 2008 respectively.

The brand name UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) was introduced in 2006 as a synonym for this standard.

UMB was intended to be a fourth-generation technology, which would make it compete with LTE and WiMAX. These technologies use a high bandwidth, low latency, underlying TCP/IP network with high level services such as voice built on top. Widespread deployment of 4G networks promises to make applications that were previously not feasible not only possible but ubiquitous. Examples of such applications include mobile high definition video streaming and mobile gaming.

Like LTE, the UMB system was to be based upon Internet networking technologies running over a next generation radio system, with peak rates of up to 280 Mbit/s. Its designers intended for the system to be more efficient and capable of providing more services than the technologies it was intended to replace. To provide compatibility with the systems it was intended to replace, UMB was to support handoffs with other technologies including existing CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO systems.

UMB&#x27;s use of OFDMA would have eliminated many of the disadvantages of the CDMA technology used by its predecessor, including the &quot;breathing&quot; phenomenon, the difficulty of adding capacity via microcells, the fixed bandwidth sizes that limit the total bandwidth available to handsets, and the near complete control by one company of the required intellectual property.

While capacity of existing Rel. B networks can be increased 1.5-fold by using EVRC-B voice codec and QLIC handset interference cancellation, 1x Advanced and EV-DO Advanced offers up to 4x network capacity increase using BTS interference cancellation (reverse link interference cancellation), multi-carrier links, and smart network management technologies.

In November 2008, Qualcomm, UMB&#x27;s lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring LTE instead. This followed the announcement that most CDMA carriers chose to adopt either WiMAX or LTE standard as their 4G technology. In fact no carrier had announced plans to adopt UMB.

However, during the ongoing development process of the 4G technology, 3GPP added some functionalities to LTE, allowing it to become a sole upgrade path for all wireless networks.

<text>Allan Gregg is a Canadian pollster, political advisor, television interviewer and pundit.

==Early life==
Gregg was born in Edmonton, Alberta. He was the eldest child in his family which consisted of four boys and one girl. Gregg graduated from Harry Ainlay High School at the second top of his class with honors. Gregg then went on to study political science at the University of Alberta and Carleton University in Ottawa. He briefly served as a lecturer while working on his PhD, but abandoned his studies due to the birth of his first child in 1975.

==Tory strategist==
Gregg has long been involved in Canadian politics, but decided to travel south of the border to work with Republican Party pollster Richard Wirthlin, and learned much from him. He then returned to Canada in the late 1970s. He first came to national attention as the national campaign secretary of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada successful effort in the 1979 federal election.

Soon after that campaign, Gregg founded Decima Research, a joint polling/public relations firm. The company became the Conservative party&#x27;s polling firm, and Gregg played an important role in the 1984 election when the PC Party was led by Brian Mulroney.

Gregg was an unusual-looking figure in Canadian politics, and especially in the Tory party. He adopted a unique style including gold earrings, bright red shoes, long hair, and a great deal of leather clothing. He founded a record label, The Song Corp., and was co-manager of the Tragically Hip. He also served a five-year stint as Chair of the Toronto International Film Festival.

He rose to greater prominence in the 1988 election where he handled communications and polling for the PC Party. Long an advocate for negative campaigning, he directed the famed &quot;bridge bombing&quot; attack on Liberal leader John Turner that was designed to break the bridge linking anti-free trade voters to Turner. The offensive was a success, Turner&#x27;s popularity dropped, and the Tories were re-elected. He also played an important role in the 1992 Canadian referendum where he crafted the message that the doom of Canada would be the certain result of a &quot;No&quot; vote.

==1993 election==
Gregg was given even more responsibility in the 1993 federal election campaign. He was senior pollster as well as top strategist and communications manager.

The 1993 Conservative Federal campaign was an unmitigated disaster for all concerned, including Gregg. Other campaign leaders complained that his many duties meant he missed too many meetings. Gregg again pushed for negative tactics, crafting an attack ad one of which Canadians found especially distasteful and offensive. The ad ridiculed a facial deformity of Liberal leader Jean Chrétien which was a result of a childhood polio infection. This ad backfired and the Conservatives were reduced to two seats in the House of Commons of Canada from their previous 151 seats. This was the result of a number of factors, including the intense unpopularity of former Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. His party suffered the worst defeat ever in Canadian history for an incumbent federal party.

While the Tory campaign was not going well, this television ad (which aired on only one evening) was a memorable element. Modern Canadian national political campaign coverage has had few noteworthy campaign moments, but much like the 1984 Mulroney Turner debate (&quot;You had an option, sir&quot;), this advertising mistake was memorable. Attacking a physical defect was widely seen by Canadians as a low blow and as an American-style no-holds-barred campaign style that should not be imported. Several years later Gregg wrote about this in the pages of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; magazine, where his &quot;mea culpa&quot; rang hollow, as he continued to argue that &quot;the ad tested well in the focus groups.&quot;

==Pollster==
After the campaign, Gregg left public life for a time. He quit Decima, and sold his share of the company for millions of dollars.

After a year off, he founded a new company, The Strategic Counsel, a market research and consulting firm, but one geared towards business rather than politics. He returned to the public eye as a columnist in Maclean&#x27;s magazine and a frequent pundit on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation news for several years.

Gregg also had a weekly television show, &quot;Allan Gregg in Conversation with...&quot; on the public broadcaster TVOntario. Its format was a half-hour, in-depth interview format, in which the subject of the interview was usually an author or intellectual discussing a current release. The format differed from traditional interview programs in that it included more comments from the interviewer (Gregg) than is usually the case. After several years of production TVO cancelled the program.

In 2001, he strongly denounced negative campaigning in a lecture at the School of Journalism and Communication at Carleton University, saying that it would destroy politics as we know it and &quot;invite totally unaccountable forces&quot; to &quot;influence society without the countervailing force of representative democracy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gregg was born in 1949 and has three children; Christian (b. 1975), Allanah (b. 1986), and Connor (b. 1988); his wife Marjorie died in 1995.

<text>Acoustic Alchemy is an English smooth jazz band formed in England in the early 1980s by Nick Webb and Simon James.

==1981–1989: Early days==
Acoustic Alchemy was formed around the acoustic guitars of Simon James (nylon string) and Nick Webb (steel string), often backed up by double bass, percussion, and string quartet the Violettes. The band made two albums that were unprofitable. In the mid-1980s, James left, and in the 1990s he formed Kymaera, a similar, though more Latin oriented band.

In 1985, Webb discovered Greg Carmichael, a guitarist with a London pub band called the Holloways (not affiliated with the indie band of the same name), who became James&#x27; successor. The new pairing found work as an in-flight band on Virgin Atlantic flights to and from the United States. Six weeks after sending demos to MCA, the band was called to record their first album, which was released in 1987 titled &quot;Red Dust and Spanish Lace&quot;. Appearing on the album were Mario Argandoña on percussion and Bert Smaak on drums. The album was the first of many to be recorded at the Hansa Haus Studios, in Bonn, Germany, where they met sound engineer Klaus Genuit, who worked on many of the band&#x27;s albums. Two more albums followed for MCA: &quot;Natural Elements&quot; (1988) and &quot;Blue Chip&quot; (1989). The title track from &quot;Natural Elements&quot; became the theme music for the BBC TV programme &quot;Gardeners&#x27; World&quot;.

==1990–1998: Mainstream success==
Acoustic Alchemy were soon moved to jazz label GRP as MCA bought GRP in February 1990. Six more albums followed, starting with &quot;Reference Point&quot; (1990), featuring a cover of &quot;Take Five&quot; by Dave Brubeck and &quot;Back on the Case&quot; (1991). &quot;Reference Point&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award. Webb uncovered fourteen early tracks from 1982 to 1987 featuring Simon James, which were released on the compilation &quot;Early Alchemy&quot; (1992). &quot;The New Edge&quot; (1993) and &quot;Against the Grain&quot; (1994) followed.

For their eighth album, &quot;Arcanum&quot; (1996), the band re-recorded some of its popular tracks. The album was recorded in London&#x27;s Pinewood Studios with the string section of the London Metropolitan Orchestra. The collection included three new tracks, &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;Something She Said&quot;, and &quot;Chance Meeting&quot;. Personnel on the recording was Webb, Carmichael, Sheppard, Murphy and Parsons. It was produced by Aubry &quot;Po&quot; Powell, who worked with Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant.

&quot;Positive Thinking&quot; (1998) was to be Acoustic Alchemy&#x27;s last album with original frontman Nick Webb. It was recorded over a week in a large house in Monkton Combe, near Bath, England. Recorded by Steve Jones, the musicians were Greg Carmichael (guitar), John Sheppard (drums), and Dennis Murphy (bass).

Webb was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer before working on the album and died on 5 February 1998.

==1999: Reform and changes==
After Webb&#x27;s death, Greg Carmichael brought in Miles Gilderdale as his partner, and the band moved label to Higher Octave Music. The debut album on the label, &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;, (2000) was more experimental, borrowing from several genres of music. It featured the introduction of Anthony &quot;Fred&quot; White on keyboards.

&quot;AArt&quot; (2001) was released a year later and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album.

&quot;Radio Contact&quot; (2003) contained &quot;Little Laughter&quot;, the band&#x27;s first song with a vocal, performed by Jo Harrop. Harrop was a backing vocalist who was discovered by Gilderdale during a session with Latin singer Enrique Iglesias.

Early in 2006, bassist Frank Felix left the band to concentrate on other projects. The position was filled by two bass players: former Incognito and Down to the Bone bassist Julian Crampton for UK dates and guitarist Gary Grainger (brother of longtime drummer Greg Grainger) in the U.S.

GRP re-released a concert/documentary video of Acoustic Alchemy entitled &quot;Best Kept Secret&quot; on 25 July 2006.

&quot;This Way&quot; (2007) included guest appearances by trumpeter Rick Braun and Down to the Bone. &quot;Roseland&quot; followed in 2011.
