<text>A Byzantine fault is a condition of a system, particularly a distributed computing system, where a fault occurs such that different symptoms are presented to different observers, including imperfect information on whether a system component has failed. The term takes its name from an allegory, the &quot;Byzantine generals problem&quot;, developed to describe a situation in which, to avoid catastrophic failure of a system, the system&#x27;s actors must agree on a strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable in such a way as to cause other (good) actors to disagree on the strategy and they may be unaware of the disagreement.

A Byzantine fault is also known as a Byzantine generals problem, a Byzantine agreement problem, or a Byzantine failure.

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the resilience of a fault-tolerant computer system or similar system to such conditions.

== Definition ==

A Byzantine fault is any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers. A Byzantine failure is the loss of a system service due to a Byzantine fault in systems that require consensus among multiple components.
The Byzantine allegory considers a number of generals who are attacking a fortress. The generals must decide as a group whether to attack or retreat; some may prefer to attack, while others prefer to retreat. The important thing is that all generals agree on a common decision, for a halfhearted attack by a few generals would become a rout, and would be worse than either a coordinated attack or a coordinated retreat.

The problem is complicated by the presence of treacherous generals who may not only cast a vote for a suboptimal strategy; they may do so selectively. For instance, if nine generals are voting, four of whom support attacking while four others are in favor of retreat, the ninth general may send a vote of retreat to those generals in favor of retreat, and a vote of attack to the rest. Those who received a retreat vote from the ninth general will retreat, while the rest will attack (which may not go well for the attackers). The problem is complicated further by the generals being physically separated and having to send their votes via messengers who may fail to deliver votes or may forge false votes.

Without message signing, Byzantine fault tolerance can only be achieved if the total number of generals is greater than three times the number of disloyal (faulty) generals. There can be a default vote value given to missing messages. For example, missing messages can be given a &quot;null&quot; value. Further, if the agreement is that the null votes are in the majority, a pre-assigned default strategy can be used (e.g., retreat).

The typical mapping of this allegory onto computer systems is that the computers are the generals and their digital communication system links are the messengers. Although the problem is formulated in the allegory as a decision-making and security problem, in electronics, it cannot be solved by cryptographic digital signatures alone, because failures such as incorrect voltages can propagate through the encryption process. Thus, a faulty message could be sent such that some recipients detect the message as faulty (bad signature), others see it is having a good signature, and a third group also sees a good signature but with different message contents than the second group.

== History ==

The problem of obtaining Byzantine consensus was conceived and formalized by Robert Shostak, who dubbed it the &quot;interactive consistency&quot; problem. This work was done in 1978 in the context of the NASA-sponsored SIFT project in the Computer Science Lab at SRI International. SIFT (for Software Implemented Fault Tolerance) was the brainchild of John Wensley, and was based on the idea of using multiple general-purpose computers that would communicate through pairwise messaging in order to reach a consensus, even if some of the computers were faulty.

At the beginning of the project, it was not clear how many computers in total were needed to guarantee that a conspiracy of &quot;n&quot; faulty computers could not &quot;thwart&quot; the efforts of the correctly-operating ones to reach consensus. Shostak showed that a minimum of 3&quot;n+&quot;1 are needed, and devised a two-round 3&quot;n+1&quot; messaging protocol that would work for &quot;n&quot;=1. His colleague Marshall Pease generalized the algorithm for any n &gt; 0, proving that 3&quot;n&quot;+1 is both necessary and sufficient. These results, together with a later proof by Leslie Lamport of the sufficiency of 3&quot;n&quot; using digital signatures, were published in the seminal paper, &quot;Reaching Agreement in the Presence of Faults.&quot; The authors were awarded the 2005 Edsger W. Dijkstra Prize for this paper.

To make the interactive consistency problem easier to understand, Lamport devised a colorful allegory in which a group of army generals formulate a plan for attacking a city. In its original version, the story cast the generals as commanders of the Albanian army. The name was changed, eventually settling on &quot;Byzantine&quot;, at the suggestion of Jack Goldberg to future-proof any potential offense-giving. This formulation of the problem, together with some additional results, were presented by the same authors in their 1982 paper, &quot;The Byzantine Generals Problem&quot;.

== Mitigation ==

The objective of Byzantine fault tolerance is to be able to defend against failures of system components with or without symptoms that prevent other components of the system from reaching an agreement among themselves, where such an agreement is needed for the correct operation of the system.

The remaining operationally correct components of a Byzantine fault tolerant system will be able to continue providing the system&#x27;s service as originally intended, assuming there are a sufficient number of accurately-operating components to maintain the service.

When considering failure propagation only via errors, Byzantine failures are considered the most general and most difficult class of failures among the failure modes. The so-called fail-stop failure mode occupies the simplest end of the spectrum. Whereas the fail-stop failure mode simply means that the only way to fail is a node crash, detected by other nodes, Byzantine failures imply no restrictions on what errors can be created, which means that a failed node can generate arbitrary data, including data that makes it appear like a functioning node to a subset of other nodes. Thus, Byzantine failures can confuse failure detection systems, which makes fault tolerance difficult. Despite the allegory, a Byzantine failure is not necessarily a security problem involving hostile human interference: it can arise purely from physical or software faults.

The terms fault and failure are used here according to the standard definitions originally created by a joint committee on &quot;Fundamental Concepts and Terminology&quot; formed by the IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s Technical Committee on Dependable Computing and Fault-Tolerance and IFIP Working Group 10.4 on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance. See also dependability.

Byzantine fault tolerance is only concerned with broadcast consistency, that is, the property that when a component broadcasts a value to all the other components, they all receive exactly this same value, or in the case that the broadcaster is not consistent, the other components agree on a common value themselves. This kind of fault tolerance does not encompass the correctness of the value itself; for example, an adversarial component that deliberately sends an incorrect value, but sends that same value consistently to all components, will not be caught in the Byzantine fault tolerance scheme.

== Solutions ==

Several early solutions were described by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease in 1982. They began by noting that the Generals&#x27; Problem can be reduced to solving a &quot;Commander and Lieutenants&quot; problem where loyal Lieutenants must all act in unison and that their action must correspond to what the Commander ordered in the case that the Commander is loyal:

* One solution considers scenarios in which messages may be forged, but which will be &quot;Byzantine-fault-tolerant&quot; as long as the number of disloyal generals is less than one third of the generals. The impossibility of dealing with one-third or more traitors ultimately reduces to proving that the one Commander and two Lieutenants problem cannot be solved, if the Commander is traitorous. To see this, suppose we have a traitorous Commander A, and two Lieutenants, B and C: when A tells B to attack and C to retreat, and B and C send messages to each other, forwarding A&#x27;s message, neither B nor C can figure out who is the traitor, since it is not necessarily A—the other Lieutenant could have forged the message purportedly from A. It can be shown that if &quot;n&quot; is the number of generals in total, and &quot;t&quot; is the number of traitors in that &quot;n&quot;, then there are solutions to the problem only when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 3&quot;t&quot; and the communication is synchronous (bounded delay). The full set of BFT requirements are: For F number of Byzantine failures, there needs to be at least 3F+1 players (fault containment zones), 2F+1 independent communication paths, and F+1 rounds of communication. There can be hybrid fault models in which benign (non-Byzantine) faults as well as Byzantine faults may exist simultaneously. For each additional benign fault that must be tolerated, the above numbers need to be incremented by one. If the BFT rounds of communication don&#x27;t exist, Byzantine failures can occur even with no faulty hardware.
* A second solution requires unforgeable message signatures. For security-critical systems, digital signatures (in modern computer systems, this may be achieved, in practice, by using public-key cryptography) can provide Byzantine fault tolerance in the presence of an arbitrary number of traitorous generals. However, for safety-critical systems (where &quot;security&quot; addresses intelligent threats while &quot;safety&quot; addresses the inherent dangers of an activity or mission, i.e., faults due to natural phenomena), error detecting codes, such as CRCs, provide stronger coverage at a much lower cost. (Note that CRCs can provide guaranteed coverage for errors that cryptography cannot. If an encryption scheme could provide some guarantee of coverage for message errors, it would have a structure that would make it insecure.) But neither digital signatures nor error detecting codes such as CRCs provide a known level of protection against Byzantine errors from natural causes. And more generally, security measures can weaken safety and vice versa. Thus, cryptographic digital signature methods are not a good choice for safety-critical systems, unless there is also a specific security threat as well. While error detecting codes, such as CRCs, are better than cryptographic techniques, neither provide adequate coverage for active electronics in safety-critical systems. This is illustrated by the &quot;Schrödinger CRC&quot; scenario where a CRC-protected message with a single Byzantine faulty bit presents different data to different observers and each observer sees a valid CRC.
* Also presented is a variation on the first two solutions allowing Byzantine-fault-tolerant behavior in some situations where not all generals can communicate directly with each other.

There are many systems that claim BFT without meeting the above minimum requirements (e.g., blockchain). Given that there is mathematical proof that this is impossible, these claims need to include a caveat that their definition of BFT strays from the original. That is, systems such as blockchain don&#x27;t guarantee agreement. They use resource-intensive mechanisms that make disagreements impractical to maintain.

Several system architectures were designed c. 1980 that implemented Byzantine fault tolerance. These include: Draper&#x27;s FTMP, Honeywell&#x27;s MMFCS, and SRI&#x27;s SIFT.

In 1999, Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov introduced the &quot;Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance&quot; (PBFT) algorithm, which provides high-performance Byzantine state machine replication, processing thousands of requests per second with sub-millisecond increases in latency.

After PBFT, several BFT protocols were introduced to improve its robustness and performance. For instance, Q/U, HQ, Zyzzyva, and ABsTRACTs, addressed the performance and cost issues; whereas other protocols, like Aardvark and RBFT, addressed its robustness issues. Furthermore, Adapt tried to make use of existing BFT protocols, through switching between them in an adaptive way, to improve system robustness and performance as the underlying conditions change. Furthermore, BFT protocols were introduced that leverage trusted components to reduce the number of replicas, e.g., A2M-PBFT-EA and MinBFT.

== Applications ==

Several examples of Byzantine failures that have occurred are given in two equivalent journal papers. These and other examples are described on the NASA DASHlink web pages.

=== Applications in computing ===
Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms use components that repeat an incoming message (or just its signature, which can be reduced to just a single bit of information if self-checking pairs are used for nodes) to other recipients of that incoming message. All these mechanisms make the assumption that the act of repeating a message blocks the propagation of Byzantine symptoms. For systems that have a high degree of safety or security criticality, these assumptions must be proven to be true to an acceptable level of fault coverage. When providing proof through testing, one difficulty is creating a sufficiently wide range of signals with Byzantine symptoms. Such testing will likely require specialized fault injectors.

=== Military applications ===
Byzantine errors were observed infrequently and at irregular points during endurance testing for the newly constructed &quot;Virginia&quot; class submarines, at least through 2005 (when the issues were publicly reported).

=== Cryptocurrency applications ===
The Bitcoin network works in parallel to generate a blockchain with proof-of-work allowing the system to overcome Byzantine failures and reach a coherent global view of the system&#x27;s state. Some proof of stake blockchains also use BFT algorithms.

=== Blockchain Technology ===
Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a crucial concept in blockchain technology, ensuring that a network can continue to function even when some nodes (participants) fail or act maliciously. This tolerance is necessary because blockchains are decentralized systems with no central authority, making it essential to achieve consensus among nodes, even if some try to disrupt the process.

==== Applications and Examples of Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Blockchain ====
Safety Mechanisms: Different blockchains use various BFT-based consensus mechanisms like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), Tendermint, and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) to handle Byzantine faults. These protocols ensure that the majority of honest nodes can agree on the next block in the chain, securing the network against attacks and preventing double-spending and other types of fraud. Practical examples of networks include Hyperledger Fabric, Cosmos and Klever in this sequence. 

51% Attack Mitigation: While traditional blockchains like Bitcoin use Proof of Work (PoW), which is susceptible to a 51% attack, BFT-based systems are designed to tolerate up to one-third of faulty or malicious nodes without compromising the network&#x27;s integrity.

Decentralized Trust: Byzantine Fault Tolerance underpins the trust model in decentralized networks. Instead of relying on a central authority, the network&#x27;s security depends on the ability of honest nodes to outnumber and outmaneuver malicious ones.

Private and Permissioned Blockchains: BFT is especially important in private or permissioned blockchains, where a limited number of known participants need to reach a consensus quickly and securely. These networks often use BFT protocols to enhance performance and security.

=== Applications in aviation ===
Some aircraft systems, such as the Boeing 777 Aircraft Information Management System (via its ARINC 659 SAFEbus network), the Boeing 777 flight control system, and the Boeing 787 flight control systems, use Byzantine fault tolerance; because these are real-time systems, their Byzantine fault tolerance solutions must have very low latency. For example, SAFEbus can achieve Byzantine fault tolerance within the order of a microsecond of added latency. The SpaceX Dragon considers Byzantine fault tolerance in its design.

<doc id="970032" wikidata="Q6963088" url="?curid=970032" title="Nancy Workman">
<text>Nancy Workman (December 9, 1940 – May 3, 2020) was an American politician who was the first county mayor of Salt Lake County, and a member of the Republican Party. She was the last Republican to have held this office. She was born in Pueblo, Colorado, but grew up in Boise, Idaho where her father was an automobile dealer. She finally settled in the Salt Lake Valley during her senior year of high school.

Workman went to college at the University of Utah and ran a construction business before seeking office as county recorder. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990 she was finally elected in 1994 to a six-year term. Later, after the post was approved by the county commission, Workman was elected to the newly created post of county mayor of Salt Lake County.

As County Mayor, Workman presided over a budget of nearly $700 million and never asked for a tax increase. She moved the county-owned planetarium from its historic but outdated facility on State Street to the new Gateway shopping development. Workman also worked to establish a fire district and supported self-determination of unincorporated areas in the county.

In 2004, Democratic District Attorney David Yocum accused Workman of misusing funds to pay for an employee at a local chapter of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. She faced two felony charges of misusing county monies by allegedly placing county employees at the club: one Second Degree Felony and one Third Degree.

During the trial, it was revealed that the county employee was actually hired as a replacement for Workman&#x27;s daughter at the Boys &amp; Girls Club, rather than an assistant, as the D.A. had suspected. On February 10, 2005 a jury found Workman not guilty of all charges.

Originally, Workman decided not to drop out of the 2004 county mayoral race, even when the Utah GOP dropped public support for her. The Republicans replaced her with Ellis Ivory as a write-in candidate. On October 12, 2004, Workman then dropped out of the race in an effort to give the Republicans a better chance at securing the office. She was succeeded in office by Democrat Peter Corroon.

Workman later served as the President and CEO of the Sandy Area Chamber of Commerce. She died at her home in St. George in 2020, aged 79.

<doc id="970036" wikidata="Q2746259" url="?curid=970036" title="Party chair">
<text>In politics, a party chair (often party chairperson/-man/-woman or party president) is the presiding officer of a political party. The nature and importance of the position differs from country to country, and also between political parties.

The role of a party chairperson is often quite different from that of a party leader. The duties of the chairman are typically concerned with the party membership as a whole, and the activities of the party organization. Chairpersons often play important roles in strategies to recruit and retain members, in campaign fundraising, and in internal party governance, where they may serve as a member of, or even preside over, a governing board or council. They often also have influence in candidate selections, and sometimes in the development and promulgation of party policy. When describing the position within the American Democratic Party, PBS NewsHour described it as &quot;part cheerleader, part fundraiser, part organizer and recruiter, part public messenger&quot;.

Throughout the years Party Chairperson roles have changed as candidates create their own fundraising committees.

==Examples==

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the top position of a political party is typically called its chairman (&quot;voorzitter/président&quot;), but its role is rather that of a party leader or even a combination of both. The party chairman/leader is the mightiest person within the party, controlling appointments etc. After the Prime Minister of Belgium the party chairmen are the most important figures in Belgian politics, sometimes characterized as a particracy. Following parliamentary elections, the party chairmen are the chief negotiators of the coalition agreement, and subsequently the chairman of the largest governing party typically becomes the Prime Minister and resigns as party chairman; he is replaced by a different chairman, usually interim. For example, PS chairman Elio Di Rupo became Prime Minister of the Di Rupo Government in 2011 and resumed the chairmanship in 2014 at the end of the government. He was replaced by Thierry Giet and Paul Magnette during this period.

Most major political parties elect their chairman by a vote of all the party&#x27;s members. This practice was started by the Flemish liberal party in the 1990s.

=== India ===

The convenor of the ruling BJP led National Democratic Alliance is called the Chairperson. India&#x27;s Home Minister Amit Shah holds the post.

===China===
The leader of Chinese Communist Party between 1943 and 1982 was the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. The post of chairman was abolished in 1982, and most of its functions were transferred to the revived post of General Secretary. The move was made as part of a larger effort to distance the country from Maoist politics.

=== Malaysia ===
Usually in Malaysia, the term is used to refer any leader of a political coalition. The term &#x27;president&#x27; in the other hand refer to a political party leader. Despite that, the role of a coalition chair is the same as party leader. The leader of the largest party within the coalition is usually will also be the chairperson of his or her alliance. However, this is not a requirement. For example, current President of People&#x27;s Justice Party cum Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also the Chairman of Pakatan Harapan despite his party is not the largest one in the coalition.

However, in a political party, there may still a title of Chairperson (often styled as Permanent Chairperson) exist in most of parties. It holds the highest ranking in any party posts. Despite that, the position is not the most powerful within the party as the President still holds its power.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, in contrast to Belgium, the chairmen are relatively weak, due to a separation of powers. Chairmen of political parties merely control the party organization, the bureau, and its finances, while the political leader, often the chair of the parliamentary party, decides over the party&#x27;s political course. Many party chairmen go on to occupy more important posts. Ria Beckers for instance was chairman of the Political Party of Radicals, before she became chair of its parliamentary party. There is one important exception to the above picture: Jan Marijnissen, former political leader of the Socialist Party combined being political leader of its parliamentary party and chairman of the party itself. In both smaller and newer parties. Both the party chair and the political leader is often not are occupied by the same person due to the size and the rapid organization of the party

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom the term may refer to the holder of the office of Chairman of the Conservative Party or to a senior member of the Labour Party (not to be confused with the other Chairman of the Labour Party who chairs the NEC or the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party elected solely by Labour MPs). This title was given to Labour&#x27;s Harriet Harman after she was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party in June 2007.

===United States===
The chairmen of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) serve as the operational heads of their respective political party. In addition, each state and territory has their own Democratic and Republican Party which also have chairmen or chairwomen.

<doc id="970046" wikidata="Q1046980" url="?curid=970046" title="Martin Delany">
<text>Martin Robison Delany (May 6, 1812January 24, 1885) was an American abolitionist, journalist, physician, military officer and writer who was arguably the first proponent of black nationalism. Delany is credited with the Pan-African slogan of &quot;Africa for Africans.&quot; Born as a free person of color in Charles Town, Virginia, now West Virginia (not Charleston, West Virginia), and raised in Chambersburg and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Delany trained as a physician&#x27;s assistant. During the cholera epidemics of 1833 and 1854 in Pittsburgh, Delany treated patients, even though many doctors and residents fled the city out of fear of contamination. In this period, people did not know how the disease was transmitted.

Delany traveled in the South in 1839 to observe slavery firsthand. Beginning in 1847, he worked alongside Frederick Douglass in Rochester, New York to publish the &quot;North Star&quot;. In 1850, Delany was one of the first three black men admitted to Harvard Medical School, but all were dismissed after a few weeks because of widespread protests by white students. These experiences convinced Delany that black people had no future in the United States, leading him instead to the possibility of settling them in Africa. He visited Liberia, a United States colony founded by the American Colonization Society, and lived in Canada for several years, but when the American Civil War began, he returned to the United States. When the United States Colored Troops were created in 1863, he recruited for them. Commissioned as a major in February 1865, Delany became the first African American field grade officer in the United States Army.

After the Civil War, Delany went to the South, settling in South Carolina. There he worked for the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and became politically active, including in the Colored Conventions Movement. Delany ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor as an Independent Republican. He was appointed as a trial judge, but he was removed following a scandal. Delany later switched his party affiliation. He worked for the campaign of Democrat Wade Hampton III, who won the 1876 election for governor in a season marked by violent suppression of black Republican voters by Red Shirts and fraud in balloting.

==Early life and education==
Delany was born free in Charlestown, Virginia (present-day Charles Town, West Virginia, not Charleston, West Virginia) to Pati and Samuel Delany. Although his father was enslaved, his mother was a free woman. Under Virginia&#x27;s slave laws, children were considered born into the social status of their mothers (&quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;). All of Delany&#x27;s grandparents had been born in Africa. His paternal grandparents were of Gola ethnicity (from modern-day Liberia), taken captive during warfare and brought as slaves to the Virginia colony. Family oral history said that the grandfather was a chieftain, who had escaped to Canada for a period, and died resisting slavery&#x27;s abuses.

His mother Pati&#x27;s parents were born in the Niger Valley, West Africa, and were of Mandinka ethnicity. Her father was said to have been a prince named Shango, captured with his betrothed Graci and brought to America as slaves. After some time, their master gave them their freedom in Virginia, perhaps based on their noble birth. Shango returned to Africa. Graci stayed in the colony with their only daughter Pati. When Delany was just a few years old, attempts were made to enslave him and a sibling. Their mother Pati carried her two youngest children 20 miles to the courthouse in Winchester to argue successfully for her family&#x27;s freedom, based on her own free birth.

As he grew up, Delany and his siblings learned to read and write using &quot;The New York Primer and Spelling Book&quot;, given to them by a peddler. Virginia prohibited education of black people. When the book was discovered in September 1822, Pati moved with her children to nearby Chambersburg in the free state of Pennsylvania to ensure their continued freedom. They had to leave their father Samuel, but a year later he was allowed to buy his freedom and he rejoined his family in Chambersburg.

In Chambersburg, young Martin continued learning. Occasionally he left school to work when his family could not afford for him to study. In Pennsylvania, black children were only educated through the elementary grades, so Delany educated himself by reading. In 1831, at the age of 19, he journeyed west to the growing city of Pittsburgh, where he attended the Cellar School of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. He apprenticed with a white physician.

Delany and three other young black men were later accepted into Harvard Medical School, but they were forced to leave after white students protested. The whites reportedly petitioned the school to exclude applicants of color.

==Marriage and family==
While living in Pittsburgh, in 1843 Delany met and married Catherine A. Richards. She was the daughter of a successful food provisioner, said to be one of the wealthiest families in the city. The couple had eleven children, seven of whom survived into adulthood. The parents stressed education, and some of their children graduated from college.

==Pittsburgh==
Delany became involved with Trinity A.M.E. Church on Wylie Avenue, which had classes for adults. The church was part of the first independent black denomination in the United States, which was founded earlier in the 19th century in Philadelphia. Shortly after, he learned classics, Latin and Greek with Molliston M. Clark, who studied at Jefferson College. During the national cholera epidemic in 1832, Delany became apprenticed to Dr. Andrew N. McDowell, where he learned contemporary techniques of fire cupping and leeching, then considered the primary techniques to treat most diseases. He continued to study medicine under the mentorship of Dr. McDowell and other abolitionist doctors, such as Dr. F. Julius LeMoyne and Dr. Joseph P. Gazzam of Pittsburgh.

Delany became more active in political matters. In 1835, he attended his first National Negro Convention, held annually in Philadelphia since 1831. He was inspired to conceive a plan to set up a &#x27;Black Israel&#x27; on the east coast of Africa.

In Pittsburgh, Delany began writing on public issues. In 1843, he began publishing &quot;The Mystery&quot;, a Black-controlled newspaper. His articles and other writings were often reprinted in other venues, such as in abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison&#x27;s &quot;The Liberator&quot;. A eulogy which Delany delivered for Rev. Fayette Davis in 1847 was widely redistributed. His activities brought controversy in 1846, when he was sued for libel by &quot;Fiddler&quot; Johnson, a Black man he accused in &quot;The Mystery&quot; of being a slave catcher. Delany was convicted and fined $650 — a huge amount at the time. His white supporters in the newspaper business paid the fine for him.

While Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison were in Pittsburgh in 1847 on an anti-slavery tour, they met with Delany. In the same year, after a falling-out of sorts occurred between Douglass and &quot;The Liberator&quot; editor Garrison over the use of violence in the abolition cause and the concept of a strictly African-American-run newspaper, Delany with Douglass conceived of the newspaper developed as the &quot;North Star&quot;: to give voice to the stories of African Americans from their own accounts. They started publication later that year in Rochester, New York, where Douglass was based. Douglass handled the editing, printing, and publishing, while Delany traveled to lecture, report, and obtain subscriptions.

In July 1848, Delany reported in the &quot;North Star&quot; that U.S. District Court Justice John McLean had instructed the jury in the &quot;Crosswait&quot; trial to consider it a punishable offense for a citizen to thwart those trying to &quot;repossess&quot; an alleged runaway slave. His coverage influenced the abolitionist Salmon P. Chase to lead a successful drive to remove McLean as a candidate of the Free Soil Party for the Presidency later that summer.

==Medicine and nationalism==
While living in Pittsburgh, Delany studied medicine under doctors. He founded his own practice in cupping and leeching. In 1849, he began to study more seriously to prepare to apply to medical school. In 1850 he was accepted into Harvard Medical School, after presenting letters of support from seventeen physicians, although other schools had rejected his applications. Delany was one of the first three black men to be admitted there. However, the month after his arrival, a group of white students wrote to the faculty, complaining that &quot;the admission of blacks to the medical lectures highly detrimental to the interests, and welfare of the Institution of which we are members&quot;. They cited that they had &quot;no objection to the education and elevation of blacks but do decidedly remonstrate against their presence in College with us.&quot;

Within three weeks, Delany and his two fellow black students, Daniel Laing, Jr. and Isaac H. Snowden, were dismissed, despite many students and staff at the medical school supporting their being students. Furious, Delany returned to Pittsburgh. He became convinced that the white ruling class would not allow Black people to become leaders in society, and his opinions became more extreme. His book, &quot;The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States, Politically Considered&quot; (1852), argued that black people had no future in the United States. He suggested they should leave and found a new nation elsewhere, perhaps in the West Indies or South America. More moderate abolitionists were alienated by his position. Some resented his criticizing men who failed to hire colored men in their own businesses. Martin Delany was also actively involved in the Prince Hall Freemasonry movement, which aligned with his efforts to promote civil rights and social progress for African Americans during the 19th century.

Delany worked for a brief period as principal of a colored school before going into practice as a physician. During a severe cholera outbreak in 1854, most doctors abandoned the city, as did many residents who could leave, since no one knew how the disease was caused nor how to control an epidemic. With a small group of nurses, Delany remained and cared for many of the ill.

Delany is rarely acknowledged in the historiography of African-American education. He is generally not included among African-American educators, perhaps because he neither featured prominently in the establishment of schools nor philosophized at length on Black education.

==Emigration==
Having heard stories about his parents&#x27; ancestors, he wanted to visit Africa, which he considered his spiritual home.

In August 1854, Delany led the National Emigration Convention in Cleveland, Ohio, along with his friend James Monroe Whitfield, the abolitionist poet, and other black activists.

Delany advanced his emigrationist argument in his second manifesto, &quot;Political Destiny of the Colored Race on the American Continent&quot;. The 1854 convention approved a resolution stating: &quot;[A]s men and equals, we demand every political right, privilege and position to which the whites are eligible in the United States, and we will either attain to these, or accept nothing.&quot; A significant number of women attendees also voted for the resolution, considered the foundation of black nationalism.

In 1856, Delany moved his family to Chatham, Ontario, Canada, where they remained for nearly three years. In Chatham, he assisted in Underground Railroad activities, helping resettle American refugee slaves who had reached freedom in Canada. The same year, he was a member of the Chatham Vigilance Committee that sought to prevent former slaves from being returned to the United States and brought back into slavery, such as the case of Sylvanus Demarest.

In response to Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s anti-slavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852), in 1859 and 1862, Delany published parts of &quot;Blake; or the Huts of America: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, the Southern United States, and Cuba&quot; in serialized form. His novel portrayed an insurrectionist&#x27;s travels through slave communities. It highlights Cuba as the source of illegal international slave trade to the United States. He believed that Stowe had portrayed slaves as too passive, although he praised her highlighting the cruelty of Southern slave owners. Modern scholars have praised Delany&#x27;s novel as an accurate expression of black culture. The first half of Part One was serialized in &quot;The Anglo-African Magazine&quot;, January to July 1859. The rest of Part One and Part Two was included in serial form in the &quot;Weekly Anglo African Magazine&quot; from 1861 to 1862. It was not published in book form until 1970 and the last chapters remain missing.

In May 1859, Delany sailed from New York for Liberia, to investigate the possibility of a new black nation in the region. The colony had been founded by the American Colonization Society to relocate free black people outside of the United States. He traveled for nine months and signed an agreement with eight indigenous chiefs in the Abeokuta region, in today&#x27;s Nigeria, that would permit settlers to live on &quot;unused land&quot; in return for applying their skills for the community&#x27;s good. It is a question whether Delany and the chiefs shared the same concepts of land use. The treaty was later dissolved due to warfare in the region, opposition by white missionaries, and the advent of the American Civil War.

In April 1860, Delany left Liberia for England. His presence at the International Statistical Congress in London in July of that year discomfited the American minister to Great Britain, former Vice-president George M. Dallas:Toward the close of the session, Lord Brougham, seeing Mr. Dallas, the American Minister, present, said: &#x27;I hope my friend Mr. Dallas will forgive me reminding him that there is a negro present, a member of the Congress.&#x27; (Loud laughter and vociferous cheering.) After the cheering had subsided, Mr. Dallas made no sign, but the negro in question, who happened to be Dr. Martin R. Delany, from Canada, rose, amid loud cheers, and said: &#x27;I pray your Royal Highness will allow me to thank his lordship, who is always a most unflinching friend of the negro, for the observation he has made, and I assure your Royal Highness and his lordship that I am a man.&#x27; This novel and unexpected incident elicited a round of cheering very extraordinary for an assembly of sedate statisticians.According to some sources, an abashed American delegate walked out in protest. As 1860 ended, Delany returned to the United States. The next year, he began planning settlement of Abeokuta, and gathered a group of potential settlers and funding. However, when Delany decided to remain in the United States to work for emancipation of slaves, the pioneer plans fell apart.

==Union Army service==

In 1863, after Abraham Lincoln had called for a military draft, the 51-year-old Delany abandoned his dream of starting a new settlement on Africa&#x27;s West Coast. Instead, he began recruiting black men for the Union Army. His efforts in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and later Ohio raised thousands of enlistees, many of whom joined the newly formed United States Colored Troops. His son Toussaint Louverture Delany (named after Toussaint Louverture a major leader of the Haitian Revolution) served with the 54th Regiment. The senior Delany wrote to the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, requesting that he make efforts &quot;to command all of the effective black men as Agents of the United States&quot;, but the request was ignored. During the recruitment, 179,000 black men enlisted in the U.S. Colored Troops, almost 10 percent of all who served in the Union army.

In early 1865, Delany was granted an audience with Lincoln. He proposed a corps of black men led by black officers, who he believed could serve to win over black Southerners to the Union side. Although the government had already rejected a similar appeal by Frederick Douglass, Lincoln was impressed by Delany and described him as &quot;a most extraordinary and intelligent man&quot; in a written memo to his Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Delany was commissioned as a major in February 1865, becoming the first black field officer in the United States Army and achieving the highest rank an African-American field officer would reach during the Civil War. (The highest-ranking African-American officer of the Civil War, among those who received their commissions from the United States government, was Dr. Alexander Thomas Augusta, a medical officer who obtained the rank of Lt. Colonel by brevet.)

Delany especially wanted to lead colored troops into Charleston, South Carolina, the former secessionist hotbed. When Union forces captured the city, Major Delany was invited to the War Department ceremony in which Major General Robert Anderson would unfurl the very flag over Fort Sumter that he had been forced to lower four years earlier. Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson and abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison and Henry Ward Beecher also participated in the ceremony. Major Delany had recruited black Charlestonians to restore the capacity of the 103rd and 104th regiments and start the 105th regiment of U.S. Colored Troops. He arrived at the ceremony with Robert Vesey, son of Denmark Vesey, who had been executed for starting a slave rebellion. The man came in the &quot;Planter&quot;, a ship piloted by the former slave Robert Smalls (who had taken it over during the war and driven the ship to Union lines, running the Confederate blockade outside Charleston Harbor).

The following day, the city learned that President Lincoln had been assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Delany continued with the planned political rally for Charleston&#x27;s freedmen, with Garrison and Senator Warner as speakers. He soon published an open letter to African Americans asking them to contribute to a memorial for &quot;the Father of American Liberty&quot;. Two weeks later, Delany was scheduled to speak at another rally, before the visiting Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. A journalist was surprised when Delany addressed the issue of ill-feelings between black freedmen and mulattos (or &quot;browns&quot;, free people of color and mixed race) in Charleston. He said that two mulattos had informed authorities about Denmark Vesey&#x27;s plans for a rebellion in 1822 conspiracy, rather than trying to promote racial healing and empowerment between the groups.

After the war, Delany initially remained with the Army and served under General Rufus Saxton in the 52nd U.S. Colored Troops. He was later transferred to the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, serving on Hilton Head. Encountering Delany at a black church in South Carolina several weeks after the end of the Civil War, journalist Whitelaw Reid described him as &quot;a coal-black negro, in the full uniform of a Major of the army, with an enormous regulation hat&quot; and &quot;no lack of flowing plume, or gilt cord and knots,&quot; who, while giving an ill-received speech, was noisily interrupted by the arrival of Salmon P. Chase, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Delany shocked white officers after the war by taking a strong position in supporting redistribution of land to freedmen. Later in 1865, Delany was mustered out of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and shortly afterward resigned from the Army.

==Later life==
Following the war, Delany continued to be politically active. He established a land and brokerage business in 1871 and worked to help black cotton farmers improve their business and negotiating skills to get a better price for their product. He supported the Freedman&#x27;s Bank (as did Douglass), and also traveled and spoke in support of the Colored Conventions Movement. Delany also argued against carpetbaggers and black candidates for office when he saw fit. For instance, he opposed the vice presidential candidacy of Jonathan Jasper Wright and John Mercer Langston on the grounds of inexperience, and he opposed the candidacy of another black man as Charleston&#x27;s mayor.

Delany unsuccessfully sought various positions, such as appointment as Consul General to Liberia. In 1874, Delany ran as an Independent Republican for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina (with John T. Green as the gubernatorial candidate). Despite the corruption scandals that enveloped former Republican governor Franklin Moses, Jr. (who chose not to run for re-election), their ticket lost to Republican Attorney General Daniel H. Chamberlain and his running mate Richard Howell Gleaves.

Delany was appointed as a trial justice (judge) in Charleston. In 1875, charges of &quot;defrauding a church&quot; were brought against him. After conviction, he was forced to resign, and served time in jail. Although pardoned by Republican Governor Chamberlain, with the intervention of Wade Hampton, Delany was not allowed to return to his former position.

Delany supported Democratic candidate Wade Hampton in the 1876 gubernatorial election, the only prominent black person to do so. Partly as a result of black swing votes encouraged by Delany, Hampton won the election by fewer than 1,100 votes. However, the election was marred by white intimidation and violence against black Republicans, in an effort to suppress the black vote. Armed men from &quot;rifle clubs&quot; and the Red Shirts operated openly. The latter was a paramilitary group of mostly white men who worked to suppress black voting as &quot;the military arm of the Democratic Party.&quot; By 1876, South Carolina rifle clubs had about 20,000 white men as members. More than 150 black people were killed in election-related violence.

In early 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops from the South after reaching a compromise over the national election. This marked the end to Reconstruction, and Governor Chamberlain left the state. The Democrats, calling themselves Redeemers, had taken control of South Carolina&#x27;s legislature. Paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts continued to suppress black voting in the Carolinas, especially in the upland counties.

In reaction to whites regaining power and the suppression of black voting, black Charlestonians started planning again for emigration to Africa. In 1877, they formed the Liberia Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company, with Delany as chairman of the finance committee. A year later, the company purchased a ship, the &quot;Azor&quot;, for the voyage led by Harrison N. Bouey. He served as president of the board to organize the voyage.

==Last years and death==
In 1880, Delany withdrew from the project to serve his family. Two of his children were students at Wilberforce University in Ohio and required money for tuition fees. His wife had been working as a seamstress to make ends meet. Delany began practicing medicine again in Charleston. On January 24, 1885, he died of tuberculosis in Wilberforce, Ohio.

Delany is interred in a family plot at Massies Creek Cemetery in Cedarville, Ohio, next to his wife Catherine, who died July 11, 1894. For over 120 years his family plot was only marked with a small government-issued tombstone on which his name was misspelled. Three of his children, Placido (died 1910), Faustin (died 1912) and Ethiopia (died 1920), were subsequently buried alongside their parents. Every grave except Martin&#x27;s remained unmarked. In 2006, after many years of fundraising, The National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center was able to raise $18,000 (~$ in ) to have a monument built and placed at the grave site of Delany and his family. The monument is made of black granite from Africa and features an engraved picture of Delany in uniform during the war.

==Legacy and honors==
According to historian Benjamin Quarles the most extraordinary characteristic about Delany:
: was his deep-seated pride of race in his wide range of activities... Delaney has been called &#x27;the father of African nationalism,&#x27; a sobriquet reflecting his pride in his color and ancestry, his insistence that Negro Americans control their destiny, and his firm belief that Black Africa would one day regain its ancient glory... By word and deed Delaney&#x27;s pride in blackness and his emotional attachment to Africa struck a responsive vein in the hearts of many Negro Americans of his day and subsequently.

*In 1853 the abolitionist poet James Monroe Whitfield dedicated his book &quot;America and other poems&quot; to Delany.
*In 1991, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker near 5 PPG Place in Pittsburgh, near to where Delany published &quot;&#x27;The Mystery&quot;, Meaning unclear. that commemorated Delany&#x27;s historic importance. In 2003, Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a second historical marker on Main Street in Chambersburg, noting Delany&#x27;s historic importance.
*In 1999, Star Lodge #1 of the Prince Hall Masons erected a historical marker in Charles Town to honor Delany (adding an &quot;n&quot; to his middle name).
*In 2002, the scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Delany as among the 100 Greatest African Americans.
*In 2017, the West Virginia Legislature passed a resolution to name the new bridge over the Shenandoah River carrying West Virginia Route 9 the &quot;Major Martin Robison Delany Memorial Bridge&quot;
*A mannequin of Delany greets visitors at the From Slavery to Freedom exhibit at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

<text>Exuma is a district of The Bahamas, consisting of over 365 islands and cays.

The largest of the islands is Great Exuma, which is 37 mi (60 km) in length and joined to another island, Little Exuma, by a small bridge. The capital and largest town in the district is George Town (population 1,437). It was founded 1793 and located on Great Exuma. Near the town, but on Little Exuma, the Tropic of Cancer runs across Pelican Beach lending it another name: Tropic of Cancer Beach. Its white sand and turquoise waters make it a world-famous destination. The entire island chain is 130 mi (209 km) long and 72 sq mi (187 km²) in area. Great Exuma island has an area of 61 sq mi (158 km²) while Little Exuma has an area of 11 sq mi (29 km²).

Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Exuma more than doubled, reflecting the construction of large and small resort properties and the related direct air traffic to Great Exuma from locations as distant as Toronto, Canada. The population in 2010 was 6,928.

== Etymology ==
The indigenous Lucayan people called the Exuma Cays as &quot;Curateo&quot;, meaning &quot;outer far distant land&quot;.

== History ==
Exuma was settled in or around 1783 by American colonial loyalists fleeing the Revolutionary War. The expatriates brought a cotton plantation economy to the islands. George Town was named in honour of George III, to whom the settlers maintained their loyalty. A few smaller cays still remain partially or wholly privately owned, albeit they are still referred to as part of the Exuma–Bahamas Cays; they are distinguished by a three-digit suffix number. The best known examples are adjoined cays Exuma 642 and 643, which are suffering from receding shorelines.

John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle, a Loyalist settler of the Exumas, is a major figure in the islands&#x27; heritage. Upon his death in 1842, he bestowed all of his significant Exuma land holdings to his slaves. As a result, towns on Great Exuma such as Rolleville and Rolletown were named after him.

The islands are a popular spot for yachting, sailing, diving, and coral reef and cave exploring. Many of the unnamed beaches and coves of the islands, including extensive offshore reef areas, are included in the protected Exuma National Land and Sea Park or the Moriah Harbour Cay National Park of the Bahamas National Trust. Some of the islands on which there are permanent residents and resorts include Great Exuma, Little Exuma, Stocking Island, Staniel Cay (home of the Staniel Cay Yacht Club, a fixture in the Exumas), Fowl Cay, Musha Cay and Iguana Cay. Thunderball Grotto, located just a few hundred yards off Staniel Cay, is one location where the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; was filmed. Sandy Cay, just a short boat ride from Little Exuma was the location used for filming the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; beach scenes and a Shell commercial. The novel &quot;Wind from the Carolinas&quot; was set in Great Exuma.

The Exumas are the historic home of the indigenous Lucayans, who were wholly enslaved in the 16th century, leaving the islands uninhabited until the 18th century. In the intervening period, the Exumas provided many hideouts and stashes for pirates. Elizabeth Harbour was allegedly a favorite lair of Captain Kidd.

In 2017, it was the site of the Fyre Festival, a fraudulent &quot;luxury&quot; music festival which became notorious online and in the media for its shambolic organization, and the numerous lawsuits that followed.

==Transportation==

Exuma International Airport serves the island of Great Exuma including the city of George Town directly from Nassau, Miami, Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte, and Toronto. Staniel Cay and Black Point also have small airstrips commercially served by charter or scheduled charter airlines. A number of other cays have small airstrips, both private and public. Boat travel from Nassau to the Northern Exuma Cays is approximately one hour.

Local transportation may consist of taxis, rental vehicle or golf cart depending on the cay.

==Food==
 The Exumas are known for fresh food and cultural significance to The Bahamas. Sea life regularly caught for commercial purpose include barracuda, bonefish, conch, grouper, jack, lobster, marlin, sailfish, snapper, tarpon, tuna and wahoo.

Exumian food is often similar or a slight variation of traditional Bahamian dishes.

The George Town Fish Fry is a collection of businesses, some of which are only open at night serving a variety of cuisine. It is popular among local residents and tourists alike.

==Economy==
The capital, George Town, is home to government offices, shops and services that serve both the traveling public and residents of the islands. As of 2021 there was 1 bank, a police station, 2 grocery stores, 3 liquor stores, a gas station and 1 hotel within the town proper although there are a few other businesses nearby that are typically associated as being in George Town due to proximity.

There are a number of restaurants throughout Exuma, the majority of which serve variations of local cuisine, and some that serve other cuisines such as Italian.

=== Fishing ===
Fishing is a part of both the local and tourism economies of Exuma. Visitors may fish on their own, hire a fishing guide or charter for sport while the local fishing economy primarily supports the local population&#x27;s food supply. Locals can be often seen fishing from shore and bridges presumably for their own food, often using a hand line.

Known as the &quot;Grey Ghost&quot;, bonefish can be found in the flats areas covered by as little as one foot of water, or less. Their fair colouration is perfectly adapted as camouflage against the sandy ocean bottom, making the fish difficult to spot in spite of the clear Bahamian waters. Anglers may employ spin casting equipment, but more often opt for fly-fishing in their hunt for bonefish. Other flats fish targets may include permit and tarpon.

Fishing in Exuma is primarily separated into two broad regions, the shallower southern or western side and the deep water of Exuma Sound, although some inshore fishing grounds exist such as in Moriah Harbour National Park. These areas are habitat for other types of fish including various snapper, grunts, jacks, grouper are possible to be caught throughout the fishing areas in Exuma while pelagic species like wahoo, mahi-mahi, barracuda, marlin, tuna, sailfish and more are primarily caught in Exuma Sound.

=== Tourism ===
The islands have built a reputation as a luxury travel destination.

=== Telecommunication ===
The telephone area code for the island is 242, which is the same as the rest of the Bahamas. There are 2 main telecommunication providers that cover most of the Exuma cays, Aliv and BTC Bahamas.

High-speed internet is available from both providers with varying technologies such as DSL, cellular and fiber optic cable becoming available.

==Culture==
The annual Bahamian Music and Heritage Festival, Regattas, Junkanoo and various &quot;homecoming&quot; events held in smaller settlements are highly anticipated in The Exumas by tourists and islanders alike. These festivals may focus on the food, sailing competition, arts, and music of the local culture.

==Media==
Because the population is so tiny, there is a small traditional media industry. The Bahamas is served by many newspapers, radio stations and web sites, whereas the local media on Great Exuma consists of The Blaze 98.3 FM. &quot;The Chain&quot; is a free newspaper published monthly and is the &quot;one source for current and accurate information&quot; on the chain of islands.

=== Books ===
Some books have been written about living in Exuma, including &quot;Life on a Rock&quot; and &quot;This Sweet Place: Island Living and Other Adventures&quot;.

==Religion==

St. John&#x27;s Baptist Church was built in 1892; St. Theresa&#x27;s Church was built in 1960; St. Andrews Anglican Parish is the oldest church in Georgetown.

The Baptist church of Farmer&#x27;s Hill ordained Rev. Stephen Smith in 2015. Rev. Smith &#x27;superseded&#x27; Dr. Irvin Clarke Sr., who had been pastor for the previous 45 years. The culvert at Farmer&#x27;s Hill is being repaired, with sustainable development by an islands construction company.

==Sports==
Sandals Emerald Bay has an 18-hole golf course designed by professional golfer Greg Norman. Emerald Bay hosts the Great Exuma Classic on the Web.com Tour.

Sailing is a popular sport in Exuma and with many competitions year-round. The Family Island Regatta in George Town is a recurring event at the beginning of every year. Others include the George Town Cruising Regatta and Black Point Regatta.

Rowing is being developed in Exuma with the aim of developing the island as an outlet for competitive and recreational rowing.

== Politics ==
For elections to the House of Assembly of the Bahamas, Exuma is part of &quot;The Exumas and Ragged Island&quot; constituency.

==Notable people==
The main island has been a haven for celebrities for years. Until recently, the tourist population on the island was extremely minimal, allowing anonymity for anyone escaping the spotlight. Frequent visitors included Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, who stayed at the Goat Cay home of Babbie Holt, Jackie Onassis, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and Sigourney Weaver, who vacationed there with her family. More recently, the islands were used by John McAfee, founder of McAfee Software, who conducted his brief 2020 presidential campaign from a boat moored in the harbour.

The Bahamian tax structure may be an advantage for some with the desire to establish residency, while others may purchase homes for private use or investment. Some have purchased private islands, while others have purchased more common homes. A number of well-known people own islands or residences in the Exumas. These include Aga Khan, Nicolas Cage, David Copperfield, Ali Daei, Johnny Depp, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Ali Karimi, Eddie Murphy, Eddie Irvine, Tyler Perry and Jena Sims.

<doc id="970055" wikidata="Q5699585" url="?curid=970055" title="Marlow Cook">
<text>Marlow Webster Cook (July 27, 1926 – February 4, 2016) was an American politician from Kentucky who served as a member of the United States Senate from his appointment in December 1968 to his resignation in December 1974. He was a moderate Republican.

He also ran the lobbying firm Cook and Henderson with former Democratic United States House of Representatives member David N. Henderson from North Carolina, and the two were the primary political lobbyists for the Tobacco Institute in the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Cook was born in Akron, New York, a town in Erie County, New York. He moved to Louisville, Kentucky at 17. Also at that age, he joined the United States Navy and served on submarines in both the European Theater of Operations, United States Army and Theaters of Operations in the Pacific War during World War II. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Louisville and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1948 and a law degree in 1950. He practiced law in Louisville until 1957.

==Political career==
===Kentucky House of Representatives===
Cook was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1957 and again in 1959. He served on a special committee analyzing education in the state and also on a planning committee.

Cook was elected to two terms as Jefferson County Judge, the equivalent of a mayoral or county executive position administering populous Jefferson County, which, by the 1960s, was mostly suburbs of Louisville. He was elected in 1961 and, along with fellow Republican William Cowger, who became the new mayor of Louisville, Cook unseated the Democratic Party, which had held both offices for 28 years.

In 1962, Cook was primarily responsible for the county&#x27;s $34,000 purchase of the decrepit steamboat &quot;Avalon&quot; at government auction in Cincinnati. Auctioned as little more than scrap material, upon refurbishment the boat was now called the &quot;Belle of Louisville&quot;, and, , it still carried passengers yearly and was one of the most recognizable symbols of the city. At the time, Interstate 64 was being constructed along the city&#x27;s waterfront, and Cook&#x27;s purchase of the steamboat was intended as a measure to bring attention to the city&#x27;s historic cobblestone wharf.

A politically motivated taxpayer suit was brought by local lawyer Daniel Boone because of the county&#x27;s expenditure of such an &quot;outrageous sum&quot; for a dilapidated &quot;throwback to the Dark Ages of transportation,&quot; in Alan Bates&#x27; memorable phrase. According to Cook, the expenditure worked out to roughly six cents per taxpayer, a negligible sum, even at that time, and when individual citizens complained, he would simply pay them off with pennies from a jar that he kept in his office desk for the purpose. In a 1989 interview, Cook said that some people insisted on checks, and he wrote several such six-cent checks, but none of them was ever cashed.

Cook was reelected county judge in 1965 by a wide margin, 121,481 votes to Democrat William B. Stansbury&#x27;s 71,280.

In 1967, Cook ran at the top of a slate of statewide office holders as a candidate for governor of Kentucky in the Republican primary election. He was narrowly defeated by more conservative Barren County Judge Louie Nunn, who went on to be elected the first Republican governor in Kentucky since 1943. Nunn had also been the party&#x27;s unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in 1963 but had narrowly lost to Democrat Ned Breathitt. At the time, Kentucky governors could not succeed themselves in office.

===U.S. Senator===
In 1968, Cook ran for the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of another moderate Republican, Thruston Ballard Morton, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. In the general election in which Richard Nixon carried Kentucky over Hubert Humphrey and George Wallace, Cook defeated former state Commerce Commissioner Katherine Peden. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold statewide office in Kentucky. He was subsequently one of the first Republican senators to call for Nixon to resign during the Watergate scandal.

Cook was defeated in his 1974 bid for re-election by Governor Wendell Ford, a popular Democrat. Cook&#x27;s repeated plea that Ford debate him was seen as highly unusual. Following the election, Cook resigned his seat early, in December, so that Ford could resign and be appointed senator by his successor, thus having greater seniority in assuming the office. (Morton had done the same for Cook, in 1968.)

==Later career==
Following his political career, Cook practiced law in Washington, D.C. until 1989, when he retired to Sarasota, Florida. In a fiery op-ed, he announced his support for Democrat John Kerry of Massachusetts in the 2004 United States presidential election: &quot;I have been, and will continue to be, a Republican. But when we as a party send the wrong person to the White House George W. Bush, then it is our responsibility to send him home if our nation suffers as a result of his actions.&quot;

Some of his former aides went on to congressional careers. Mitch McConnell, later the Senate Minority Leader, was Cook&#x27;s chief legislative aide from 1968 to 1970, and John Yarmuth, then-chair of the United States House Committee on the Budget, was an aide to Cook in the 1970s, later becoming a Democrat before running for office.

Cook, however, opposed McConnell in the 1984 campaign. McConnell defeated the incumbent Democratic senator, Walter Dee Huddleston.

In later years, Cook was uncertain about what he considered McConnell&#x27;s turn to the right. McConnell had helped Cook to advance the unsuccessful Equal Rights Amendment, but Cook opposed his former aide on several other pieces of legislation, particularly his opposition to the Affordable Care Act.

Cook died on February 4, 2016, in Sarasota, Florida from complications from a heart attack, at age 89.

<doc id="970058" wikidata="Q782752" url="?curid=970058" title="Protocol-Independent Multicast">
<text>Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) is a family of multicast routing protocols for Internet Protocol (IP) networks that provide one-to-many and many-to-many distribution of data over a LAN, WAN or the Internet. It is termed &quot;protocol-independent&quot; because PIM does not include its own topology discovery mechanism, but instead uses routing information supplied by other routing protocols. PIM is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol; it can make use of any unicast routing protocol in use on the network. PIM does not build its own routing tables. PIM uses the unicast routing table for reverse-path forwarding.

There are four variants of PIM: 
* PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) explicitly builds unidirectional shared trees rooted at a &quot;rendezvous point&quot; (RP) per group, and optionally creates shortest-path trees per source. PIM-SM generally scales fairly well for wide-area usage.
* PIM Dense Mode (PIM-DM) implicitly builds shortest-path trees by flooding multicast traffic domain wide, and then pruning back branches of the tree where no receivers are present. PIM-DM is straightforward to implement but generally has poor scaling properties. The first multicast routing protocol, DVMRP used dense-mode multicast routing. See RFC 3973. 
* Bidirectional PIM (Bidir-PIM) explicitly builds shared bi-directional trees. It never builds a shortest path tree, so may have longer end-to-end delays than PIM-SM, but scales well because it needs no source-specific state. See RFC 5015.
* PIM Source-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM) builds trees that are rooted in just one source, offering a more secure and scalable model for a limited number of applications (mostly broadcasting of content). In SSM, an IP datagram is transmitted by a source S to an SSM destination address G, and receivers can receive this datagram by subscribing to channel (S,G). See informational .

PIM-SM is commonly used in IPTV systems for routing multicast streams between VLANs, subnets or local area networks.

==Versions==
There are two PIM versions. The versions are not directly compatible though may coexist on the same network. Network equipment may implement both versions. PIMv2 has the following improvements over PIMv1: A single RP is used per group. RP discovery is accomplished by a Bootstrap Router (BSR). Groups are either sparse or dense mode; Interfaces can be either. General improvements to protocol flexibility and efficiency.

==Sparse mode==
Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse-Mode (PIM-SM) is a protocol for efficiently routing Internet Protocol (IP) packets to multicast groups that may span wide-area and inter-domain internets. The protocol is named &quot;protocol-independent&quot; because it is not dependent on any particular unicast routing protocol for topology discovery, and &quot;sparse-mode&quot; because it is suitable for groups where a very low percentage of the nodes (and their routers) will subscribe to the multicast session. Unlike earlier dense-mode multicast routing protocols such as DVMRP and dense multicast routing which flooded packets across the network and then pruned off branches where there were no receivers, PIM-SM explicitly constructs a tree from each sender to the receivers in the multicast group.

===Multicast clients===
A router receives explicit Join/Prune messages from those neighboring routers that have downstream group members.

* In order to join a multicast group, G, a host conveys its membership information through the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
* The router then forwards data packets addressed to a multicast group G to only those interfaces on which explicit joins have been received.
* A Designated Router (DR) sends periodic Join/Prune messages toward a group-specific Rendezvous Point (RP) for each group for which it has active members.
** Note that one router will be automatically or statically designated as the rendezvous point (RP), and all routers must explicitly join through the RP.
* Each router along the path toward the RP builds a wild card (any-source) state for the group and sends Join/Prune messages on toward the RP.
** The term route entry is used to refer to the state maintained in a router to represent the distribution tree.
** A route entry may include such fields as:
*** source address
*** the group address
*** the incoming interface from which packets are accepted
*** the list of outgoing interfaces to which packets are sent
*** timers, flag bits, etc.
** The wild card route entry&#x27;s incoming interface points toward the RP
** The outgoing interfaces point to the neighboring downstream routers that have sent Join/Prune messages toward the RP as well as the directly connected hosts which have requested membership to group G.
* This state creates a shared, RP-centered, distribution tree that reaches all group members.

===Multicast sources===
* When a data source first sends to a group, its Designated Router (DR) unicasts Register messages to the Rendezvous Point (RP) with the source&#x27;s data packets encapsulated within.
* If the data rate is high, the RP can send source-specific Join/Prune messages back towards the source and the source&#x27;s data packets will follow the resulting forwarding state and travel un-encapsulated to the RP.
* Whether they arrive encapsulated or natively, the RP forwards the source&#x27;s de-capsulated data packets down the RP-centered distribution tree toward group members.
* If the data rate warrants it, routers with local receivers can join a source-specific, shortest path, distribution tree, and prune this source&#x27;s packets off the shared RP-centered tree.
* For low data rate sources, neither the RP, nor last-hop routers need join a source-specific shortest path tree and data packets can be delivered via the shared RP-tree.

Once the other routers which need to receive those group packets have subscribed, the RP will unsubscribe to that multicast group, unless it also needs to forward packets to another router or node. Additionally, the routers will use reverse-path forwarding to ensure that there are no loops for packet forwarding among routers that wish to receive multicast packets.

==Dense mode==
Dense mode multicast is one mode that multicast can use to construct a tree for sending packets to the multicast subscribers. It is an alternative to sparse mode.

The basic assumption behind dense mode is that the multicast packet stream has receivers at most locations. Sparse mode assumes relatively fewer receivers. Dense mode is ideal for groups where many of the nodes will subscribe to receive the multicast packets, so that most of the routers must receive and forward these packets (groups of a high density).

This difference shows up in the initial behavior and mechanisms of the two protocols. Dense Mode uses a fairly simple approach to handle IP multicast routing. The source initially broadcasts to every router directly connected to it. These neighboring routers further forward the data to their neighbors. When a router does not wish to receive this group&#x27;s data (if no other neighboring PIM routers are present and no host is interested in the group), it sends a Prune message to indicate its lack of interest. Upon receiving a Prune message, the router will modify its state so that it will not forward those packets out that interface. If every interface on a router is pruned, the router will also be pruned.

In older Cisco IOS releases, PIM-DM would re-flood all the multicast traffic every 3 minutes. This is fine for low volume multicast, but not higher bandwidth multicast packet streams. More recent Cisco IOS versions support a new feature called PIM Dense Mode State Refresh, since 12.1(5)T. This feature uses a PIM state refresh messages to refresh the Prune state on outgoing interfaces. Another benefit is that topology changes are recognized more quickly. By default, the PIM state refresh messages are sent every 60 seconds.

Additionally, the routers will use reverse-path forwarding to ensure that there are no loops for packet forwarding among routers that wish to receive multicast packets. When a data packet is received on a non-RPF interface, a mechanism is required to prevent loops. If the non-RPF interface is a LAN, an Assert message is sent. Non-Forwarder routers then send a Prune on their RPF interface if they don&#x27;t need the multicast stream. Only one such Prune is sent, at the time of the transition to having no interfaces in the Outgoing Interface List (OILIST). The LAN Prune receiver delays acting on it for 3 seconds, so that if another LAN router still needs the multicast stream, it can send a PIM Join message to counteract (cancel) the Prune. (&quot;That router doesn&#x27;t need it, but I still do!&quot;)

Suppose a router has Pruned, and some time later a receiver requests the multicast stream with an IGMP message. The router then sends a Graft message. In effect, &quot;hey, I need that multicast stream over here now&quot;.

<text>Petrof Bay is a small bay on the west side of Kuiu Island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska, United States. It is located at and opens into the Chatham Strait. 

The bay was named in 1924 for U.S. Census Bureau employee Ivan Petrof, whose reports of his travels in the late 19th century are a valuable source of Alaska history for that period.

The US Navy aircraft carrier USS &quot;Petrof Bay&quot;, launched in January 1944, was named after it.

<text>A sideboard, also called a buffet, is an item of furniture traditionally used in the dining room for serving food, for displaying serving dishes, and for storage. It usually consists of a set of cabinets, or cupboards, and one or more drawers, all topped by a wooden surface for conveniently holding food, serving dishes, or lighting devices. The words &quot;sideboard&quot; and &quot;buffet&quot; are somewhat interchangeable, but if the item has short legs, or a base that sits directly on the floor with no legs, it is more likely to be called a &quot;sideboard&quot;; if it has longer legs, it is more likely to be called a &quot;buffet&quot;.

The earliest versions of the sideboard familiar today made their appearance in the 18th century, but they gained most of their popularity during the 19th century, as households became prosperous enough to dedicate a room solely to dining. Sideboards were made in a range of decorative styles and were frequently ornamented with costly veneers and inlays. In later years, sideboards have been placed in living rooms or other areas where household items might be displayed.

In traditional formal dining rooms today, an antique sideboard is a desirable and fashionable accessory, and finely styled versions from the late 18th or early 19th centuries are the most sought-after and most costly. Among its counterparts in modern furniture styles, the form is often referred to as a &quot;server&quot;. Some of the earliest production of sideboards arose in England, France, Poland, Belgium and Scotland. Later, American designs arose. Characteristic materials used in historic sideboard manufacture include mahogany, oak, pine, and walnut.

<text>Heuston Station, ( ; ; formerly Kingsbridge Station) also known as Dublin Heuston, is one of Dublin&#x27;s largest railway stations and links the capital with the south, southwest and west of Ireland. It is operated by Iarnród Éireann (IÉ), the national railway operator. It also houses the head office of its parent company, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ). The station is named in honour of Seán Heuston, an executed leader of the 1916 Easter Rising, who had worked in the station&#x27;s offices.

==History==
In 1836, a committee of Commissioners was appointed by the British Government to identify a system of rail routes throughout Ireland which would best serve the interests of the country as a whole. In their report of 1838, Kingsbridge, or &#x27;King&#x27;s Bridge&#x27;, was selected as the optimum location for a terminus in Dublin which would most conveniently serve a main trunk railway line to the southern and western districts of Ireland. The site had been known as &quot;Kingsbridge&quot; since the completion of the nearby King&#x27;s Bridge over the River Liffey in 1828.

The Great Southern and Western Railway (GS&amp;WR) company was authorised by an Act passed in 1844 and began selecting a site in Dublin for their main city terminus, as well as the site of their headquarters. In a series of pamphlets, the promoters of a proposed rail link to Cashel, County Tipperary argued that Kingsbridge was the better choice for a Dublin terminus over a competing proposal for a Portobello terminus, due to it being conveniently located next to the quays, Smithfield cattle market, hay and straw markets, wool and butter cranes, woollen, cotton, iron and leather warehouses, the Linenhall area, as well as sites of strategic military importance such as the Royal Barracks.

An Incorporation Act entitled “An Act for Making and Maintaining a Railway from the City of Dublin to the Town of Cashel, with a Branch to the Town of Carlow&quot; was passed and established in law. On 28 October 1845 the Great Southern and Western Railway Company bought a site in Dublin adjoining the Military Road, and another parcel of ground, from the Right Honorable Henry John Lord Viscount Palmerston for £1,600. In December 1845 the GS&amp;WR began advertising for tenders for building the Kingsbridge railway terminus on the land they had recently bought.

The station opened on 4 August 1846 as the terminus and headquarters of the Great Southern and Western Railway with the Freeman&#x27;s Journal describing how &quot;carriages of all classes were densely crowded with passengers, thus giving early evidence of the vast traffic which is likely to accrue on the line when in full and perfect operation&quot;. The first regular passenger train service from the station commenced later that month with the running of two trains each way daily between Dublin and Carlow (Carlow-bound trains departed Dublin at 9am and 5pm). Trains were scheduled to take about 2hr 35min for the stretch to Carlow from where conventional mail coach connections could carry passengers onwards to Kilkenny, Clonmel, Waterford or Cork.

The passenger terminal and buildings were built to designs by London-born architect Sancton Wood, and the train sheds and infrastructure were designed by Irish-born railway engineer John MacNeill. Regarding the architectural merits of the passenger terminal, historian Maurice Craig described it thus: &quot;a delightful building, a renaissance palazzo, gay and full-blooded, with fruity swags and little domed towers on the wings, a thoroughgoing formal composition, excellently articulated&quot;.

When first constructed the station had only two platforms separated by 5 carriage lines. Two of the lines were subsequently replaced by a two-sided platform and the remaining carriage line also removed. An additional platform, created in 1872 on the south side of the station, beyond the station roof, was known as the &quot;military platform&quot; - the intention being that military personnel could be kept separate from the rest of the public. Due to the need to cater for increased demand and reduce delays, three new platforms were incorporated in August 2002 as part of a development incorporating improved signalling and approach track-work.

In 1966, on the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising, it was renamed &quot;Heuston Station&quot; in honour of Seán Heuston, a young railway worker who commanded a nearby post in the 1916 Easter Rising. Heuston was one of the 16 executed by the British after that Rising, and had previously worked in the station&#x27;s offices.

Since the station&#x27;s refurbishment and modernisation (by Quinn Savage Smyth architects and engineers Buro Happold) its retail facilities now include a branch of Easons, as well as some dining facilities, including a branch of Supermacs, several cafés, a kiosk, and a large pub.

A maintenance depot at the Inchicore railway works is located approximately three kilometres (two miles) away and, as with Heuston Station itself, was also opened in 1846.

==Operation==
Based on 2019 National Transport Authority figures for &quot;boardings and alightings&quot;, Heuston was then the third busiest station in Ireland, behind Connolly and Pearse stations, also in Dublin. All services leave the station on a triple line as far as Inchicore, quadruple line until Hazelhatch, and thereafter only double line (one each way).

===Rail services===
The following services depart Heuston on weekdays:

* 1 train per hour (tph) to 
* 7 trains per day (tpd) to 
* 1 tp2h to 
* 3 tpd to 
* 1 tph to (peak times only)
* 1 tpd to 
* 1 tph to 
* 2 tpd to 
* 1 tpd to 

Heuston is the terminus for the mainline to Cork, and there are key service and transfer points in the Cork-bound direction at:

*Kildare (for stations on the Waterford line)
*Portarlington (for routes to the west via Tullamore and Athlone)
*Portlaoise (end of commuter services from Heuston)
*Ballybrophy (junction for stations on the Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line),
*Limerick Junction (for transfer to Limerick and Ennis services, and Waterford via Clonmel)
*Mallow (junction for Killarney and Tralee, and the start of Cork commuter services).

===Links to other main railway stations===
Before 2016, the physical rail link between Connolly Station and Heuston via the Phoenix Park Tunnel was usually only used for freight and rolling stock movements. Once or twice a year special trains operated, usually from Cork to Connolly for Gaelic Athletic Association matches at Croke Park. A more regular service along this route began on 21 November 2016.

The Luas light rail red line connects the two stations (apart from off-peak Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays).
Dublin Express has a direct service to Dublin Airport.

===Platforms===
There are nine platforms: eight terminal platforms and one through platform. Platform 1 is an extension to Platform 2, and is reachable only via that platform. Prior to Heuston&#x27;s 2002-2004 upgrade, there were five terminal platforms.

The through platform is numbered Platform 10 and is situated on the Phoenix Park Tunnel line, which connects to Connolly Station. There is no platform nine. Platform 10 is some distance from the main concourse and is not used for any regularly scheduled trains.

==Proposed developments==
A 2018 consultation paper for the proposed Dublin MetroLink project included a reference to a potential future station, labelled &quot;Heuston West&quot;, with connections via the Phoenix Park Tunnel to Cabra.

Other plans, first published in the 1970s, suggested that a proposed DART Underground project would link underground stations at Heuston and Pearse Street via a tunnel. As of 2015, these plans were subject to review, and as of mid-2018, the DART Underground project was not funded.

==Heuston Luas stop==


Heuston is an interchange with Dublin&#x27;s Luas light rail tram system. Opened in 2004, Heuston Luas stop is located in front of the station building; the tram tracks run perpendicular to the main line tracks. To the north of the stop, trams cross the River Liffey on the Seán Heuston Bridge, which was refurbished as part of the Luas construction. To the south, trams travel up Steeven&#x27;s Lane, which is closed to road vehicles other than those accessing St. Patrick&#x27;s University Hospital.

Heuston has three platforms. There are two outer edge platforms and two sides of an island platform. The two platforms nearest the station serve the same section of track, used for northbound trams travelling towards Connolly or The Point. The platform nearest St. John&#x27;s Road West is for southbound trams travelling towards Tallaght and Saggart. The eastern side of the island is a terminus platform, used only in certain peak times, when extra services are run in the city centre section.

==In culture==
Exterior shots of the station appeared in the 1978 heist film &quot;The First Great Train Robbery&quot; purporting to be London Bridge railway station. The station was altered to represent the Victorian era including the erection of offices, signs, posters and horse-drawn transport.

<doc id="970070" wikidata="Q6865995" url="?curid=970070" title="Minister for the Cabinet Office">
<text>The Minister for the Cabinet Office is a position in the Cabinet Office of the United Kingdom. The minister is responsible for the work and policies of the Cabinet Office, and since February 2022, reports to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The position is currently the third highest ranking minister in the Cabinet Office, after the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

From the second May ministry until mid-2019 when the first Johnson ministry came to power, it functioned as an alternative title to Deputy Prime Minister or First Secretary of State. This practice ended when Dominic Raab was appointed as First Secretary of State on 24 July 2019, by Boris Johnson. Since a reshuffle in February 2022, the role attends Cabinet but not as a full member.

The corresponding Shadow Minister is the Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office.

==Function and status==
The Cabinet Office has a primary responsibility to support the work of the Prime Minister and ensure the effective running of government. Within this set-up, the Minister for the Cabinet Office has been seen to have varying responsibilities and stature in the government. The role is a flexible one and has variously been described as one or several of the following under different office-holders (and sometimes conflicting accounts of the status of the same office holder):

* Monitoring the co-ordination of the work of government departments
* Chairing or sitting on several Cabinet Committees
* An additional title to indicate special responsibility
* An additional title to indicate seniority

The government describes the minister for the Cabinet Office as being &quot;in overall charge of and responsible for the policy and work of the department, and attends Cabinet&quot;.

Damian Green held the office in 2017, simultaneously with the office of First Secretary of State. Green chaired numerous Cabinet Committees and filled in for the Prime Minister at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions. By virtue of his responsibilities and as First Secretary of State, he was considered the &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister. Upon the appointment of David Lidington in 2018, Lidington retained the responsibilities Green had held, but the title of First Secretary of State remained vacant (as did the office of Deputy Prime Minister, vacant since 2015).

As a result, the office in its 2017–2019 absorbed the responsibilities of a &quot;de facto&quot; Deputy Prime Minister, without either of the associated titles usually granted to individuals in the British Government (First Secretary of State or Deputy Prime Minister). In 2019, new Prime Minister Boris Johnson ended this arrangement with the appointment of a new First Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, before upgrading his title again to Deputy Prime Minister in 2021.

==Current minister and responsibilities==
Nick Thomas-Symonds has served as the Minister for the Cabinet Office since 8 July 2024. He also serves as Paymaster General alongside his position. 

The most recent responsibilities are:
*Oversight of all Cabinet Office policy and appointments
*Oversight of transition period activity and the United Kingdom&#x27;s future relations with the EU

*Devolution issues and Strengthening the Union
*Leading cross-government and public sector transformation and efficiency
*Oversight of cross-government work on veterans&#x27; issues
*Oversight of Cabinet Office responsibilities on National Security and resilience, and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, including COVID-19
*Supporting the coordination of the cross-government and the devolution aspects of the response to COVID-19

==Ministers for the Cabinet Office==
Every occupant of the position has simultaneously held a sinecure office, this being Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster from Clark to Byrne, Paymaster General from Jowell to Gummer, and First Secretary of State with Green. Oliver Dowden, and all holders since Michael Ellis, including the incumbent Nick Thomas-Symonds, have held the office of Paymaster General, while David Lidington, Michael Gove and Steve Barclay held the role of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

<doc id="970075" wikidata="Q6490735" url="?curid=970075" title="Larry Maguire">
<text>Larry Maguire (born June 1, 1949) is a politician and activist farmer in Manitoba, Canada. Formerly a Progressive Conservative MLA in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election on November 25, 2013. He is a member of the Conservative Party of Canada and sits on the House Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. During the 43rd Canadian Parliament Maguire&#x27;s Private member&#x27;s bill, Bill C-208, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (transfer of small business or family farm or fishing corporation) was adopted.

==Farming activist==

Maguire was the owner and operator of Maguire Farms Limited in Elgin with his former spouse, Beryl from 1975 to 2001 when the farmland was sold to neighbours. He was named mid-Canada&#x27;s Outstanding Young Farmer in 1986, and received a Certificate of Merit from the Manitoba Agricultural and Food Sciences Grads Association in 1990. He was twice elected as the Canadian Wheat Board Advisory Committee&#x27;s Western Manitoba Representative, serving from 1987 to 1994. He was also chairman of the Agricultural Diversification Alliance (ADA) and a public governor of the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange in this period, and advocated changes to the federal Crow Equity Fund.

Maguire served as president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association from 1995 to 1999. This group opposed the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s single-desk marketing policy, and favoured market competition in wheat and barley. Maguire campaigned for re-election as a Wheat Board advisor in 1994 on an openly anti-monopoly platform, arguing that sellers could receive higher prices through an open market. Others disagreed with his assessment. He was defeated by pro-monopoly candidate Bill Nicholson, 2,728 votes to 1,544.

Maguire supported the anti-monopoly position in a 1997 CWB referendum on barley sales. Farmers rejected this position, with 67% opting to remain with single-desk marketing. Maguire was critical of the referendum question, arguing that it should have included a dual-market option.

In 1998, Maguire was appointed to a council evaluating proposals for the Agri-food Research and Development Initiative. This was a joint project from the federal and provincial governments. Later in the same year, he endorsed anti-monopoly candidates in the first ever election of the Canadian Wheat Board&#x27;s directors. Pro-monopoly candidates won eight of the ten positions.

==Politician==

;Federal politics

In June 1993, Maguire upset provincial cabinet minister Jim McCrae to win the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada nomination for Brandon—Souris in the 1993 federal election. The final vote among party members was 1,520 to 1,194. Maguire emphasized farming issues in his nomination speech, and argued that he would be successful in bringing Reform Party supporters back to the Progressive Conservatives.

The Brandon—Souris riding had been held by the PCs since 1953, and had long been considered a safe seat for the party. The party&#x27;s support base in western Canada collapsed, however, with most of that support transferring to the Reform Party. Maguire was pushed into third place behind the Reform candidate and Liberal Party of Canada Glen McKinnon. He planned to seek the PC nomination again for the 1997 election, but withdrew in favour of Brandon Mayor Rick Borotsik.

On August 12, 2013, Merv Tweed, Borotsik&#x27;s successor, announced his resignation from the House of Commons. The following week, Maguire announced his intention to seek the Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination in the electoral district.

Maguire was re-elected in the 2015 and 2019 Canadian federal elections. In the lead up to the 2019 election, Maguire was one of 27 candidates with a strong environmental track record from across the political spectrum to be endorsed by GreenPAC. GreenPAC is a non-profit, non-partisan organization that works to elect and support environmental leaders. Maguire&#x27;s endorsement is a recognition of his efforts to protect water and wetlands as an MLA and an MP. This includes securing funding for water management and wetland restoration projects such as the Assiniboine River Basin Initiative.

During the 43rd Canadian Parliament Maguire&#x27;s Private member&#x27;s bill, Bill C-208, was adopted. Introduced on February 19, 2020, Bill C-208: An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (transfer of small business or family farm or fishing corporation) applies the capital gains tax and its exemptions, instead of the dividend tax, to inter-generational transfers of corporations classified as small businesses, family farms, and family fishing corporations so that they are taxed at the same rate as they would when selling to a third party. Previously, it was more financially advantageous for an owner to sell their operation to a third-party than to a family member from a taxation perspective.

;Provincial politics

Maguire sought the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba nomination for Arthur-Virden in April 1999, but lost to rival candidate Gary Nestibo. Nestibo forfeited his nomination following allegations of dubious land sales and vote-stacking, however, and a new nomination meeting was scheduled for August. Maguire finished second on the first ballot, behind Gary&#x27;s wife Lorna Nestibo, but won on the second count with support from third-place candidate Grant Fotheringham. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1999 provincial election, as the New Democratic Party won a majority government under Gary Doer. He entered the legislature as a member of the opposition.

Maguire was appointed as the Progressive Conservative critic for the environment, and lobbied for improvements to the provincial Water Rights Act. He represented the PCs in an all-party delegation to Ottawa to advocate increased funding for farmers, and served on an all-party provincial committee on agriculture.

There were rumours that Maguire would campaign to succeed Gary Filmon as Progressive Conservative Party leader in 2000, although nothing came of this. In 2001, he was reassigned as PC critic for rural development. Shortly thereafter, he recommended conducting research into the possibility of selling large quantities of water to the United States. In 2002, he participated in an all-party mission to the United States to oppose that country&#x27;s farm subsidy policies. He was promoted to finance critic later in the year.

Maguire decided not to open a constituency office following his 1999 election, saying that he could communicate with his constituents by telephone and e-mail. In 2002, he was one of five PC MLAs to support a government motion granting pension, alimony and death benefits to gay and lesbian spouses.

He was re-elected in the 2003 provincial election, as the NDP won an increased majority across the province. After the election, he served as his party&#x27;s critic for transportation, conservation and intergovernmental affairs. In 2004, he opposed a proposal to introduce photo radar in rural Manitoba. Hugh McFadyen was elected as the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s new leader in 2006, and chose Maguire as his deputy leader and Infrastructure Critic.

Maguire was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election, in which the New Democratic Party won a third consecutive majority government. In September 2007, he was replaced as deputy leader by Myrna Driedger and was appointed Critic for Infrastructure and Transportation, Government Services, and Competitiveness, Training and Trade.

<text>The Shumagin Islands (Unangan: &quot;Qagiiĝun&quot;; ) are a group of 20 islands in the Aleutians East Borough south of the mainland of Alaska, United States, at 
54°54&#x27;–55°20&#x27; North 159°15&#x27;–160°45&#x27; West. The largest islands are Unga Island, Popof Island, Korovin Island, and Nagai Island. Other islands include Andronica, Big Koniuji, Little Koniuji, Simeonof, Chernabura, and Bird. The total land area is 1,192.369 km2 (460.376 sq mi) and their total population as of the 2020 census was 578 persons, almost entirely in the city of Sand Point, on Popof Island.

The Shumagin Islands were named after Nikita Shumagin, one of the sailors on Vitus Bering&#x27;s 1741 expedition to North America who died of scurvy and was buried on Nagai Island.

<doc id="970099" wikidata="Q595713" url="?curid=970099" title="Return address">
<text>In postal mail, a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message. It provides the recipient (and sometimes authorized intermediaries) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed.

The return address should include an address or P.O. box details in the same way as the delivery address should. In most countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, France, the return address is located in the upper left-hand corner of the envelope, card, or label, which is also recommended by the Universal Postal Union. In the United Kingdom, the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope, after the words &quot;Return address&quot;.

Businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address. Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence. Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots. Rolls of return address labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes.

The return address is not required on postal mail. However, lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable; such as from damage, postage due, or invalid destination. Such mail may otherwise become dead letter mail.

==History==
The return address has been used on U. S. postage since the 1880s. As pressure printing became more commonplace during the early 1900s, labels became cheaper and more easily distributed. The profession involved with producing these labels was known as lithography.

During the 1950s in the United States, more and more mail was not arriving at intended recipients, and as a result of the lack of a return address, said mail ended up in the dead letter office. With this rise in dead mail, the post office pleaded for people to use a return address. Even after this, the public still tended to neglect to add a return address. This prompted the postmaster to inform the public that mail without a return address would be less of a priority than mail with a return address.

Still, the public did not widely use a return address until the 1960s when companies began to offer deals for preprinted return labels such as 2,500 labels for $2.00. They became more popular with the invention of label dispensers. With the invention of the personal computer, software enabled people to print their own labels. As email began to overtake written mail, the return address became automatic in an e-mail.

<doc id="970103" wikidata="Q6097202" url="?curid=970103" title="Ivan Petrof">
<text>Ivan Petrof (1842? - 1896) (commonly spelled &quot;Petroff&quot; in sources) was a Russian-born soldier, writer, and translator who for many years was regarded as a major authority on Alaska. According to historian Terrence Cole, Petrof &quot;holds the distinction of probably telling more lies about Alaska that were believed for more years than any other person in history.&quot;

Petrof&#x27;s early history is obscure. He served in the United States Army 1867-1870, including service at Fort Kenai in Alaska as a translator. He re-enlisted in 1871 and subsequently deserted, though he later obtained a special discharge through political influence. He worked for H.H. Bancroft starting in about 1874 and was an author of &quot;Bancroft&#x27;s History of Alaska&quot;. He traveled to Sitka in 1878 to collect and translate source material. According to Cole, a dozen of the documents he returned with were complete forgeries (though this was not recognized until many years later).

Petrof was special agent of the United States Tenth Census (1880) for Alaska. He traveled extensively in Alaska and then prepared the &quot;Report on the Population, Industries, and Resources&quot; of Alaska, which forms 189 pages of Volume VIII of the Tenth Census, published in 1884. This report and two general maps of Alaska were issued by the Census Office, one dated 1880 and the other 1882. Petrof&#x27;s census results are still cited; in this context historian Stephen Haycox writes that &quot;in the final analysis his work has been considered generally reliable and hugely influential.&quot;

A preliminary version of the report on the population, industries, and resources of Alaska was published early in 1881 as House of Representative Ex. Doc. No. 40, Forty-sixth Congress, third session. This report contains a general map of Alaska showing Petrof&#x27;s travel route for his census work. He traveled through Kodiak, the Shumagin Islands, Sannak, Belkofski, Unalaska, Unimak, Atka, the Pribilof Islands, and St. Michael. He also journeyed for considerable distances up the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers.

After 1880 he lived in Kodiak, Alaska. From 1883-1887 he was assistant collector of Customs at Kodiak. Subsequently he was director of the 1890 census for Alaska.

In 1892, while writing up the census results, he was asked to serve as a translator for the US State Department in connection with the Bering Sea Arbitration. It was discovered that he had inserted his own interpolations into the translated Russian documents; this caused great embarrassment to the United States since the translations had already been submitted to the tribunal. This ended his public career and called his previous work into question. Subsequently it has been discovered that much of what he said and wrote about his own experience was false.

Petrof Bay on Kuiu Island in the Alaska Panhandle and (probably) Petrof Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula are named for Ivan Petrof.

<text>The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially known as the VII Olympic Winter Games, was an international multi-sport event held in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy, from 26 January to 5 February 1956. A total of 821 athletes representing 32 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 24 events in 4 sports across 8 disciplines.

Overall, athletes from 13 nations received at least one medal, and 9 of them won at least one gold medal. At their first Winter Olympics, athletes from the Soviet Union won the most gold medals, with 7, and the most overall medals, with 16. Athletes from Austria came second in the medal table with 4 gold medals and 11 medals overall, while athletes from Finland came third with 3 gold medals and 7 medals overall. Teams from Poland and Japan won their nations&#x27; first Winter Olympic medals.

Alpine skier Toni Sailer of Austria won the most gold medals for an individual at the Games. He won the three gold medals available in the men&#x27;s alpine skiing events and became the first person to do so. Cross-country skier Sixten Jernberg of Sweden won the most overall medals for an individual at the Games, winning four medals with one gold, two silvers, and one bronze.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

In speed skating, two gold medals (and no silver) were awarded to Yevgeny Grishin and Yuri Mikhaylov for a first-place tie in the men&#x27;s 1500 metres event.

<text>Cognex Corporation is an American manufacturer of machine vision systems, software and sensors used in automated manufacturing to inspect and identify parts, detect defects, verify product assembly, and guide assembly robots. Cognex is headquartered in Natick, Massachusetts, USA and has offices in more than 20 countries.

Cognex began exploring commercial applications of machine vision in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, Cognex&#x27;s business grew due to a demand for machine vision tools to help automate semiconductor and electronics manufacturing. While semiconductor manufacturing remains an important market for Cognex, it has expanded to general manufacturing applications.

The company&#x27;s product portfolio includes In-Sight, VisionPro software, and DataMan.

==History==
Cognex Corporation was founded in 1981 by Robert J. Shillman, a lecturer in human visual perception at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two MIT graduate students, Bill Silver and Marilyn Matz. Cognex stands for &quot;Cognition Experts.&quot;

The company&#x27;s first vision system, DataMan, was introduced in 1982. DataMan was an optical character recognition (OCR) system designed to read, verify, and assure the quality of letters, numbers, and symbols printed on products and components. The company&#x27;s first customer was a typewriter manufacturer that purchased DataMan to read letters on typewriter keys and ensure that they were located in the correct position.

In 1989, Cognex went public on the NASDAQ exchange for $1.38 per share—within a year, the stock price had tripled.

In 1995, Cognex purchased Acumen, a U.S. based developer of wafer identification systems.

In 2004, the company won an intellectual property victory when a federal judge ruled in Cognex&#x27;s favor in a patent lawsuit brought against the estate of the inventor Jerome H. Lemelson, who had filed dozens of submarine patents, some of which purported to cover machine vision processes. The machine vision-related patents were held invalid. The ruling was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

Cognex sold off its in-vehicle product in 2007, citing concerns about profitability and intellectual property issues.

In 2015 Cognex sold off its Surface Vision Division and the associated range of products SmartView (web inspection), Vision Gear (slit inspection), Smart Advisor (process surveillance, web monitoring) and VisionPro Surface to Ametek Inc. for approximately 160M US$. The sold division represented about 12% of Cognex in terms of revenue and number of employees.

In April 2017 Cognex acquired ViDi Systems, a Swiss-based provider of deep learning software for industrial machine vision applications. In October 2019 Cognex acquired Sualab, a Korean-based developer of vision software using deep learning for industrial applications.

During summer 2020 Cognex laid off 8% of its headcount (190 employees). In December 2020 Cognex announced payment of $2 dividend per share. In the press release explaining this special dividend the chairman, Robert J.

<doc id="970121" wikidata="Q7672224" url="?curid=970121" title="TVR Speed Six engine">
<text>The TVR Speed Six was the name of a naturally aspirated straight-6 engine manufactured from 1999 to 2007 by British car manufacturer TVR, and used in several of their cars including the Tuscan, Cerbera, Tamora, T350, Sagaris and Typhon. 

The engine&#x27;s prototypes (referred to as AJP-6) were designed and delivered by independent engineer Al Melling (the &quot;A&quot; in AJP) as both 3.0 and 3.5 litre units. Many of its key cylinder head design elements (particularly the valvetrain) were first seen in the 1991 Suzuki GSX-R750 (M) motorcycle engine (also a Melling design).

The key design features were an all aluminium alloy block and head, with cast iron cylinder liners, double overhead camshafts, finger follower 24-valve actuation, one throttle and injector per cylinder (throttle-body fuel injection), equal length tubular exhaust manifolds dual 3-way catalytic converters and a dry sump lubrication system allowing the engine to be mounted lower in the vehicle chassis. These features enabled the engine to provide lightweight, compact dimensions, extremely fast throttle response and high peak horsepower. 

In order to reduce unit production costs, the engines that actually went into production, called Speed Six, were TVR modified versions of the initial AJP-6 prototypes with and capacities. Prominent modifications were alterations to valve train geometry, a switch from a billet steel crank to cast iron (with a crank damper), different connecting rods, oil filter relocation to the inlet side of the engine, and removal of the exhaust cam oil feed. The two different capacities were achieved through stroke alterations from a con-rod design able to accommodate two different stroke lengths, and different piston crown designs altering the compression ratios. The bore diameters were shared. Pistons were made in Italy by Asso Werke from pre-existing casts, initially designed for the Rotax-Aprilia RSV 1000 engine. Those casts, refused by Rotax, were modified and used to produce the smaller Speed Six pistons.

Unfortunately, during TVR’s development of the original MCD design, it was decided to remove the drilled lubrication oil-ways from the camshaft centres to the peak of each of the camshaft lobes, resulting in starvation of lubrication and early versions of the Speed Six engine suffering from poor valve-train durability leading to many warranty claims against TVR. 

German and French tuners and owners have, since, re-introduced these oil-ways, returning the motor to its original, efficient and reliable design. 

Other third party development work has also mitigated this issue by using revised material hardness for the cam lobes, finger followers and valve guides. Softer valve springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have also improved durability.

The initial 4.0 litre version of the engine as used in the Cerbera produced with the final incarnations of the engine having TVR claimed outputs of in the Tuscan S, Sagaris and Typhon and being the most powerful naturally aspirated straight-six engine in any production road car.

TVR further developed the Speed Six into the limited-production V12 Speed Twelve racing engine. TVR also experimented with supercharging the Speed Six engine for use in the Typhon/T440 model. However this proved unsuccessful due to cooling challenges so the few Typhon/T440 models that made production were instead fitted with standard naturally aspirated 4.0L Speed Six engines.

<text>A robotic telescope is an astronomical telescope and detector system that makes observations without the intervention of a human. In astronomical disciplines, a telescope qualifies as robotic if it makes those observations without being operated by a human, even if a human has to initiate the observations at the beginning of the night or end them in the morning. It may have software agents using artificial intelligence that assist in various ways such as automatic scheduling. A robotic telescope is distinct from a remote telescope, though an instrument can be both robotic and remote.

By 2004, robotic observations accounted for an overwhelming percentage of the published scientific information on asteroid orbits and discoveries, variable star studies, supernova light curves and discoveries, comet orbits and gravitational microlensing observations.

All early phase gamma ray burst observations were carried by robotic telescopes.

==Design==
Robotic telescopes are complex systems that typically incorporate a number of subsystems. These subsystems include devices that provide telescope pointing capability, operation of the detector (typically a CCD camera), control of the dome or telescope enclosure, control over the telescope&#x27;s focuser, detection of weather conditions, and other capabilities. Frequently these varying subsystems are presided over by a master control system, which is almost always a software component.

Robotic telescopes operate under closed loop or open loop principles. In an open loop system, a robotic telescope system points itself and collects its data without inspecting the results of its operations to ensure it is operating properly. An open loop telescope is sometimes said to be operating on faith, in that if something goes wrong, there is no way for the control system to detect it and compensate.

A closed loop system has the capability to evaluate its operations through redundant inputs to detect errors. A common such input would be position encoders on the telescope&#x27;s axes of motion, or the capability of evaluating the system&#x27;s images to ensure it was pointed at the correct field of view when they were exposed.

Most robotic telescopes are small telescopes. While large observatory instruments may be highly automated, few are operated without attendants.

==Professional robotic telescopes==
Robotic telescopes were first developed by astronomers after electromechanical interfaces to computers became common at observatories. Early examples were expensive, had limited capabilities, and included a large number of unique subsystems, both in hardware and software. This contributed to a lack of progress in the development of robotic telescopes early in their history.

By the early 1980s, with the availability of cheap computers, several viable robotic telescope projects were conceived, and a few were developed. The 1985 book, &quot;Microcomputer Control of Telescopes&quot;, by Mark Trueblood and Russell M. Genet, was a landmark engineering study in the field. One of this book&#x27;s achievements was pointing out many reasons, some quite subtle, why telescopes could not be reliably pointed using only basic astronomical calculations. The concepts explored in this book share a common heritage with the telescope mount error modeling software called Tpoint, which emerged from the first generation of large automated telescopes in the 1970s, notably the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope.

In 2004, some professional robotic telescopes were characterized by a lack of design creativity and a reliance on closed source and proprietary software. The software is usually unique to the telescope it was designed for and cannot be used on any other system. Often, robotic telescope software developed at universities becomes impossible to maintain and ultimately obsolete because the graduate students who wrote it move on to new positions, and their institutions lose their knowledge. Large telescope consortia or government funded laboratories don&#x27;t tend to have this same loss of developers as experienced by universities. Professional systems generally feature very high observing efficiency and reliability. There is also an increasing tendency to adopt ASCOM technology at a few professional facilities (see following section). The need for proprietary software is usually driven by the competition for research dollars between institutions.

Since the late 1980s, the University of Iowa has been in the forefront of robotic telescope development on the professional side. The (ATF), developed in the early 1990s, was located on the roof of the physics building at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. They went on to complete the Iowa Robotic Observatory, a robotic and remote telescope at the private Winer Observatory in 1997. This system successfully observed variable stars and contributed observations to dozens of scientific papers. In May 2002, they completed the Rigel Telescope. The Rigel was a 0.37-meter (14.5-inch) F/14 built by Optical Mechanics, Inc. and controlled by the Talon program. Each of these was a progression toward a more automated and utilitarian observatory.

One of the largest current networks of robotic telescopes is RoboNet, operated by a consortium of UK universities. The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) Project is another example of a professional robotic telescope. LINEAR&#x27;s competitors, the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search, Catalina Sky Survey, Spacewatch, and others, have also developed varying levels of automation.

In 1997, the Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) wide-field telescope array, named ROTSE-I, began operation in manual mode. Software systems allowed fully automated robotic operation in late March 1998, with the first automated responses to GRB 980326 from triggers received over the GRB Coordinates Network. ROTSE-I operated from then on and was the first fully autonomous closed-loop robotic telescope, and was used for GRB responses, X-ray transients and Soft Gamma-ray Repeater study, variable star and meteor study. The first prompt optical burst from a GRB was discovered by ROTSE-I for GRB 990123. The ROTSE-III project involved four half-meter telescopes based on the ROTSE-I operation approach, which began operation in 2003. These were used primarily for GRB follow up study, and also a supernova search and study. It was with ROTSE-III observations that the first superluminous supernovae were discovered. 

In 2002, the RAPid Telescopes for Optical Response (RAPTOR) project, designed in 2000, began full deployment in 2002. The project was headed by Tom Vestrand and his team: James Wren, Robert White, P. Wozniak, and Heath Davis. Its first light on one of the wide field instruments was in late 2001. The second wide field system came online in late 2002. Closed loop operations began in 2003. Originally the goal of RAPTOR was to develop a system of ground-based telescopes that would reliably respond to satellite triggers and more importantly, identify transients in real-time and generate alerts with source locations to enable follow-up observations with other, larger, telescopes. It has achieved both of these goals. Now RAPTOR has been re-tuned to be the key hardware element of the Thinking Telescopes Technologies Project. Its new mandate will be the monitoring of the night sky looking for interesting and anomalous behaviors in persistent sources using some of the most advanced robotic software ever deployed. The two wide field systems are a mosaic of CCD cameras. The mosaic covers and area of approximately 1500 square degrees to a depth of 12th magnitude. Centered in each wide field array is a single fovea system with a field of view of 4 degrees and depth of 16th magnitude. The wide field systems are separated by a 38 km baseline. Supporting these wide field systems are two other operational telescopes. The first of these is a cataloging patrol instrument with a mosaic 16 square degree field of view down to 16 magnitude. The other system is a .4m OTA with a yielding a depth of 19-20th magnitude and a coverage of .35 degrees. Three additional systems are currently undergoing development and testing and deployment will be staged over the next two years. All of the systems are mounted on custom manufactured, fast-slewing mounts capable of reaching any point in the sky in 3 seconds. The RAPTOR System is located on site at Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA) and has been supported through the Laboratory&#x27;s Directed Research and Development funds. 

==Amateur robotic telescopes==
In 2004, most robotic telescopes are in the hands of amateur astronomers. A prerequisite for the explosion of amateur robotic telescopes was the availability of relatively inexpensive CCD cameras, which appeared on the commercial market in the early 1990s. These cameras not only allowed amateur astronomers to make pleasing images of the night sky, but also encouraged more sophisticated amateurs to pursue research projects in cooperation with professional astronomers. The main motive behind the development of amateur robotic telescopes has been the tedium of making research-oriented astronomical observations, such as taking endlessly repetitive images of a variable star.

In 1998, Bob Denny conceived of a software interface standard for astronomical equipment, based on Microsoft&#x27;s Component Object Model, which he called the Astronomy Common Object Model (ASCOM). He also wrote and published the first examples of this standard, in the form of commercial telescope control and image analysis programs, and several freeware components. He also convinced Doug George to incorporate ASCOM capability into a commercial camera control software program. Through this technology, a master control system that integrated these applications could easily be written in perl, VBScript, or JavaScript. A sample script of that nature was provided by Denny.

Following coverage of ASCOM in &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine several months later, ASCOM architects such as Bob Denny, Doug George, Tim Long, and others later influenced ASCOM into becoming a set of codified interface standards for freeware device drivers for telescopes, CCD cameras, telescope focusers, and astronomical observatory domes. As a result, amateur robotic telescopes have become increasingly more sophisticated and reliable, while software costs have plunged. ASCOM has also been adopted for some professional robotic telescopes.

Also in 1998, the Tenagra Observatories site near Cottage Grove, Oregon was constructed by Michael Schwartz with a robotic Celestron Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope 1998.

Meanwhile, ASCOM users designed ever more capable master control systems. Papers presented at the Minor Planet Amateur-Professional Workshops (MPAPW) in 1999, 2000, and 2001 and the International Amateur-Professional Photoelectric Photometry Conferences of 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 documented increasingly sophisticated master control systems. Some of the capabilities of these systems included automatic selection of observing targets, the ability to interrupt observing or rearrange observing schedules for targets of opportunity, automatic selection of guide stars, and sophisticated error detection and correction algorithms.

Remote telescope system development started in 1999, with first test runs on real telescope hardware in early 2000. RTS2 was primary intended for Gamma ray burst follow-up observations, so ability to interrupt observation was core part of its design. During development, it became an integrated observatory management suite. Other additions included use of the Postgresql database for storing targets and observation logs, ability to perform image processing including astrometry and performance of the real-time telescope corrections and a web-based user interface. RTS2 was from the beginning designed as a completely open source system, without any proprietary components. In order to support growing list of mounts, sensors, CCDs and roof systems, it uses own, text based communication protocol. The RTS2 system is described in papers appearing in 2004 and 2006.

The Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface (INDI) was started in 2003. In comparison to the Microsoft Windows centric ASCOM standard, INDI is a platform independent protocol developed by Elwood C. Downey of ClearSky Institute to support control, automation, data acquisition, and exchange among hardware devices and software frontends.

=== Smart telescopes ===

A newer introduction to the consumer market are smart telescopes. They are self contained robotic astronomical imaging devices that combine a small (50mm to 114mm in diameter) telescope and mount with pre-packaged software designed for astrophotography of deep-sky objects. They use GPS data and automatic star pattern recognition (plate solving) to find out where they are pointed. They have no optical system that allows the user to directly view astronomical objects and instead send an image captured over time via image stacking to a built in digital display (usually shaped like a conventional eyepiece), or to a smartphone or tablet. They come with a database of pre-programmed objects, per-determined imaging routines, and Mobile app software that allows the end user to begin astrophotography as soon as the telescope is set up. They can be operated remotely and are able to collect a series of images unattended. They can automate various techniques of astrophotography, including &quot;lucky imaging&quot; and &quot;speckle imaging&quot;. The design of the imaging system, combined with relatively small optics, are not optimal for imaging planets or the Moon. Examples include models from the French companies Unistellar and Vaonis.

<doc id="970147" wikidata="Q2658249" url="?curid=970147" title="Dublin Pearse railway station">
<text>Pearse railway station () or Dublin Pearse is a railway station on Westland Row on the Southside of Dublin, Ireland. It is Ireland&#x27;s busiest commuter station and second busiest station overall (behind Dublin Connolly railway station) with 9 million passenger journeys through the station in 2016.

==Facilities==
The station has two through platforms, 1 and 2, the former on the Boyne Street side for northbound &quot;up&quot; services towards Connolly station, the other on the Pearse Street side for southbound &quot;down&quot; services towards Bray and Wexford. It also has a café, shop and public toilets.

The southbound entrance (Pearse Street and Trinity BioScience) is open from 7:00 AM to 7:30 PM daily from Monday to Friday excluding Bank Holidays, and on Saturdays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, in addition to the main entrance on Westland Row, which is open all during station opening hours. The ticket office is open from 7:30 AM to 9:50 PM, Monday to Sunday.

==History==

===Origins===
The station building originated from a design by Charles Blacker Vignoles. As the lines from the south were elevated above street level, tracks were laid on the first floor of the building. The initial covering chosen for the passenger station was a two-span structure covering the platforms as far as Cumberland Street. It was designed to facilitate the arrival and departure of trains every 15 minutes.

The station opened for service traffic on 17 December 1834 as Westland Row Station, the city terminus of the Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway (D&amp;KR), serving and the West Pier Kingstown Harbour.

The precise details of the original 1834 trackwork may be uncertain, but a diagram from 1835 shows three platformed tracks each terminating in linked connecting turntables and a non-platformed carriage siding, all set well back from Westland Row entrance. The arrivals road and platform were nearest to Merrion Square. This was in common with most platforms until the 1870s of the low-level &quot;continental&quot; style. On the other side of the arrivals track was an island platform which was the only means of access to a train on the next track. The island platform was of a raised height design and was accessed by a lower-able drawbridge ramp from the arrivals platform. The departure track was on the side of the middle line of pillars supporting the two-span roof that extended as far as Cumberland Street. The track was serviced by a departure platform that allowed separate access for first-class passengers at the southern end of the train. The final track was a siding on the Pearse Street side of the station. The station entrance from Westland Row contained two sets of stairs to the upper platform level. There was also a (horse-drawn) cab entrance and ramp to the far end of the arrival platform which would have been convenient for first-class passengers.

In 1857, the gauge was changed from to to match the Irish standard. By then Dublin and Wicklow Railway (D&amp;WR) had taken over operations from the D&amp;KR and trains were able to run over the course of the old Dalkey Atmospheric Railway through to connecting at Shanganagh junction with the line from Harcourt Street to Bray.

Patronage grew to 4.5 million passengers per annum in the late 1870s with powers and land obtained for the enlargement of the station. A map of the station in 1878 shows a &quot;departure local &amp; arrival mail&quot; platform of not more than on the Great Brunswick Street (Pearse Street) side where platform 2 is now, and a similar platform opposite for &quot;departure mail &amp; arrival local&quot; purposes. A turntable existed at the end of the line which could enable an engine to draw away from its train, turn, and proceed up the other line if the station was empty.

There ensured various alterations in the 1880s including the replacement of the roof and thereafter had four platforms and five tracks, later becoming five platforms. The main span covered the two long platforms where the tracks were later to be extended northbound and two southbound bay platforms one to each side of them. There was also a roof span to the southwest which covers a smaller southbound bay platform.

The ownership of the station remained with the D&amp;KR until the amalgamation to Great Southern Railways in 1925. During the interim period, the main operating company the D&amp;WR changed its name to Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway (DW&amp;WR) in 1860 and Dublin and South Eastern Railway (DSER) in 1907.

===1891 rebuild as a through station===
The station was extensively rebuilt for the opening of the City of Dublin Junction Railway in 1891. During this process, the station was converted into a layout through the station with three terminus platforms that were to remain unchanged until the early 2000s with the northeast bay filled in towards the end of that period. The existing tracks at the Northern end of the station had to be raised by to give the required clearance over Westland Row and the platforms had to be sloped upwards towards the platform exit to compensate. Some DW&amp;WR suburban trains started working through to Amiens Street and boat trains and mail could subsequently be worked round to Broadstone and Kingsbridge.

An 1893 and 1924 diagram show the platforms numbered as follows:
# A bay southbound platform in the smaller canopy on the Merrion Square side. The 1893 diagram shows the platform as the same size as platform 2, and the 1924 diagram shows it as shorter.
# A bay southbound platform in under the main canopy.
# The &#x27;down&#x27; through platform which is now platform 1 generally used for southbound trains.
# The &#x27;up&#x27; though platform which is now platform 2 generally used for northbound trains. The 1893 diagram shows this shorter than platform 3.
# A bay southbound platform under the main canopy. The 1893 diagram shows this bay of a long length, in the 1924 diagram it is shown as the same length as platform 2.

===Former services===
Prior to 1936, the station handled commuter services and boat trains. In January 1937, the station took over services to Sligo, Westport and Galway over the Midland and Great Western Route via Mullingar, which were transferred to Pearse (then Westland Row) in 1934 with the closure of Broadstone Station on the north side of the Liffey. Great Southern Railways (GSR) facilitated this by installing colour light signalling in 1937 allowing reversible working for the main platforms. These express trains used platform 4 as the departure and arrivals platform which was convenient for the boat trains which generally ran into platform 5. On occasion the train for Galway train would be driven engine-first into platform 5 and the passengers loaded; it would then reverse out and pass through the station on platform 3. Services running south of Bray on the ex-DSER route to Wicklow, Arklow, Wexford and Rosslare also operated out of Westland Row, though the principal terminus for that route was, for many years Harcourt Street station until 1959.

The upgrading of the Portarlington to Athlone branch in the mid-1970s saw Westport and Galway trains transferred to Heuston station, whilst Sligo and Rosslare trains were retimed to originate and terminate at Connolly station. A very small number of passenger services to Heuston or its mainline continued to pass through Pearse station until the about the time of the closure of the Dún Laoghaire pier branch around 1989.

===Station renaming===
The station was renamed in 1966, when several Irish railway stations were renamed as part of the Easter Rising 50th-anniversary celebrations, after the Pearse brothers, Patrick and Willie. Probably due to confusion with the nearby Pearse Street, Dubliners often refer to it as &quot;Pearse Street station&quot;.

===Bay platform removal===
The bay platforms have been used as a set for movies including &quot;Johnny Nobody&quot;, &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, &quot;Nora&quot; and the 2005 remake &quot;Lassie&quot;. Until 2007 the former platform 2 was occasionally used for special services. The former platform 1 continued to exist but was unsuitable for modern passenger trains and was used as a siding before conversion to a car park. Platform 5 had also been unused for some time. By 2008 all the bay platforms had been removed or filled in.

===Station renovation===
Major renovation commenced in 2007 with publicity erected in the station for this in March 2008. As part of phase 1, automatic ticket validation machines were installed on platforms 1 and 2. The front entrance of the station was changed. The former Spar shop was completely taken out of the station and the old ticket barriers were removed. Platforms 3, 4 and 5 were removed. New signage and CCTV cameras were added on both active platforms and, on Platform 2, a larger waiting area for passengers was provided.

An additional Southbound entrance (Pearse Street and Trinity Bio Science) was opened on 9 April 2013.

===Signalling improvements===
The completion of the Irish Rail &quot;City Centre Re-signalling Project&quot; has seen an increase in the number of Northern and Maynooth line suburban trains stopping. Trains from Newbridge now also serve Pearse station. This was made possible by increasing the ability of the signalling system in the city centre to operate 20 trains per hour in both directions instead of the previous 8. The project began in March 2015 and was commissioned on 17 July 2016.

===Roof renovations===
The roof structure comprises two main sections - the main station area roof has 40 barrelled roof trusses, each spanning 28 metres, over 38 bays, with additional gable end structures at both ends. Adjacent to the main station roof there is a second similar roof, which covers a car park and station infrastructure area. This is smaller and comprises 19 trusses over 18 bays.

A €10m roof replacement project started in August 2018 and was completed in June 2020.

Pearse Station was closed for 13 weekends over the two years to facilitate the replacement project. During these weekends, northside DART, Maynooth and Drogheda services operated to and from Connolly Station, with southside DART and Rosslare services operating from Grand Canal Dock.

== Services ==

=== Train services ===
All DART services stop at the station. Additionally Pearse is on the South Eastern Commuter (Dublin Connolly to Gorey) and South Western Commuter (Grand Canal Dock to Newbridge) routes, and is a terminus for the Northern Commuter (to Balbriggan / Dundalk) and Western Commuter (to Maynooth / Longford) services. An evening peak service operates to Newry. It also services the InterCity (from Dublin Connolly to Rosslare Europort) route.
=== Bus services ===
The station is served by a number of Dublin Bus, Matthews Coach Hire and Bus Eireann routes, stops for which are located just outside the station on Westland Row and around the corner at stop number 399 on Pearse Street.

==Proposed underground station==
The National Transport Authority proposed a DART Underground connecting Heuston Station to the northern DART network via the Docklands railway station. As part of this project, an underground station would have been constructed beneath Pearse station. The proposed project was shelved in 2011, and, as of 2024, not scheduled for any development or funding until &quot;after 2042&quot;.

<text>Hotham Inlet, also known as Kobuk Lake, is an arm of Kotzebue Sound on the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is 50 miles (80 km) long and 5–20 miles (8–32 km) wide. The inlet is the outlet of the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers and it is bounded on the southwest by the Baldwin Peninsula.

This inlet was named in 1826 by Royal Navy Captain Frederick William Beechey after Sir Henry Hotham, one of the lords of the British Admiralty.

==Geography==
The eastern coast of Kotzebue Sound is broken by many deep embayments and inlets. The largest of these—Hotham Inlet—is a long, irregular-shaped body of water, cut off from the sound by a long, narrow neck of land. The largest tributaries of Kotzebue Sound—the Noatak, the Kobuk, and the Selawik—flow into the inlet.

The Selawik, the southernmost of the three, empties into Selawik Lake, which is connected by a narrow water passage with the head of Hotham Inlet. This lake or lagoon undoubtedly owes its origin to the building out of the delta of the Kobuk River, which has thus cut off a part of the former extension of the inlet. Several smaller bodies of water to the east are connected by tidal&quot; channels with the larger basin.

The eastern shore of Hotham Inlet is formed by the broad delta of the Kobuk&#x27; River, whose headwaters have not been explored, but are known to lie about 200 miles due east of Hotham Inlet, in a high mountain mass near latitude 67°, longitude 155°. In the same region are probably the sources of the Alatna, which flows south into the Koyukuk; of the Noatak, which flows west into Kotzebue Sound, and of a branch of the Colville, which flows northerly into the Arctic Ocean. The general trend of the valley of the Kobuk is east and west with, however, a number of broad bends. The lower half of the valley is characterized by a broad, flat depression, while the upper half, made up of a series of basins and connecting canyons.

Near the one hundred and sixty-first meridian the north wall of the Kobuk valley recedes and swings around the head of the eastern arm of Hotham Inlet, while the mountain range which forms the south wall terminates abruptly at the delta, a featureless plain, across which the river sends its drainage to the inlet through innumerable tortuous channels. The delta is about 30 miles square, and is bounded on the south by Selawik Lake and on the west and north by Hotham Inlet. It is traversed by a maze of intricate waterways, with numerous lakes and lagoons, is being rapidly extended seaward, and is constantly encroaching on the shallow waters of Hotham Inlet.

The Noatak is the third and probably the largest of the three rivers which flow into Kotzebue Sound from the east. Its head lies near the sources of the Colville and Kobuk, and its general course is westerly until it approaches within 30 miles of the coast, where it bends sharply and reaches the sea at the north end of Hotham Inlet by a general southerly course.

<text>Lucy Clare Davis (born 17 February 1973) is an English actress best known for playing Dawn Tinsley in the BBC comedy &quot;The Office&quot; (2001–2003). 
She is also known for her roles as Hilda Spellman in the Netflix series &quot;The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; (2018–2020), Dianne in the horror-comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), and Etta Candy in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017). She played Eva in Disney Channel&#x27;s action comedy series &quot;The Villains of Valley View&quot;, which premiered in 2022.

==Career==
Davis appeared briefly in an episode of &quot;The Detectives&quot;, a show created for and starring her father (Jasper Carrott). She played Maria Lucas in the BBC&#x27;s 1995 production of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and also had a role in the 1996 Christmas special of &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot;. After her breakthrough role as Dawn Tinsley in &quot;The Office&quot;, she appeared in the films &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; in 2004, whilst continuing to play Hayley Jordan in &quot;The Archers&quot; on BBC Radio 4. She gave up this last role when her other acting responsibilities made it impossible to continue, and the part was recast in September 2005.

Davis appeared in the third-season episode &quot;Elephants and Hens&quot; of UK TV programme &quot;Black Books&quot;. In 2006, she appeared as the &quot;Fashion TV&quot; host on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, and later that year played writer Lucy Kenwright in NBC&#x27;s &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot;. In 2008, she appeared in several episodes of the US series &quot;Reaper&quot;. In 2010, she starred in ITV&#x27;s six-episode comedy drama, &quot;Married Single Other&quot;, and also appeared in a guest role in &quot;The Mentalist&quot; alongside her then-husband Owain Yeoman. She also appears in the John Landis-produced thriller &quot;Some Guy Who Kills People&quot;. In 2012, she had a guest voice part in &quot;Family Guy&quot; for the episode &quot;Be Careful What You Fish For&quot;. She appeared in series two, episode eight of the BBC series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; (2013). She became a Patron for the performing arts group Theatretrain in 2012.

Davis played Etta Candy in the 2017 film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, the first live-action cinematic portrayal of the comic book character. She said of the character: &quot;She&#x27;s a woman in a man&#x27;s world and so being heard and seen aren&#x27;t the easiest things, but it kind of doesn&#x27;t deter her. Etta is unapologetically herself and I think that that&#x27;s the thing that has drawn me to her the most... it took quite a while in my life to be unapologetically myself.&quot;

Davis appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; as Hilda Spellman, which aired from 2018 to 2020. She is starring as Eva, known as the supervillain Surge, on the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;The Villains of Valley View&quot; which premiered on 3 June 2022.

==Personal life==
Davis is the daughter of Hazel Jackson and comedian Robert Davis, better known as Jasper Carrott. In December 1997, she underwent a kidney transplant after being diagnosed with kidney failure during a medical examination. Her mother donated the kidney. Around Christmas 2005 she was again hospitalised for kidney failure, but recovered. She also has type 1 diabetes.

On 9 December 2006, Davis married Welsh actor Owain Yeoman at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. The wedding was attended by fellow &quot;The Office&quot; cast members and writers. She was entitled to marry there as her father is an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and St Paul&#x27;s contains the chapel of the order. Davis and Yeoman separated in January 2011 and divorced in October 2011.

In 2007, Davis posed nude in the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals&#x27;s campaign against the Guards Division&#x27;s continued use of traditional bearskin caps.

<text>The Khadr family () is an Egyptian-Canadian family noted for their ties to Osama bin Laden and connections to al-Qaeda.

==Members==

The Khadr family is composed of:
* Ahmed Khadr (1948–2003), father, an Egyptian-Canadian, killed in 2003, possibly by Pakistani security forces;
* Maha el-Samnah (born 1957), mother, a Palestinian-Canadian;
* Their children:
** Zaynab Khadr (born 1979 in Ottawa), daughter; she now lives in Sudan with her fourth husband and four children.
** Abdullah Khadr (born 1981 in Ottawa), son arrested in Canada in 2005 and held for five years while an extradition request from US was reviewed. Ontario Superior Court ordered him released in 2010;
** Abdurahman Khadr (born 1982), son; 
** Ibrahim Khadr (1985–1988), a son who died of congenital heart defect;
** Omar Khadr (born 1986), son captured by American forces following a 2002 firefight and held in Guantanamo Bay from 2002 to 2012; 
** Abdulkareem Khadr (born 1989), son, became paralyzed in the attack where his father died.
** A daughter (born 1991).

===Zaynab Khadr===
Zaynab Ahmed Said Khadr (; born 1979) is the eldest daughter and first child of Ahmed Khadr, an Egyptian immigrant to Canada noted for being a terrorist and senior al-Qaeda member. Two of her younger brothers, Abdurahman and Omar, were held by the United States as enemy combatants in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp after being captured in Afghanistan in 2002.

With her family, she grew up in Pakistan and Canada, as they frequently traveled back and forth. Following a severe 1992 injury that left her father disabled, Zaynab became a &quot;second mother&quot; to the younger children of the family. She was married and divorced three times, and has a daughter from her second marriage.

She and her widowed mother returned to Canada in February 2005. Khadr has since fought for the family members&#x27; legal rights to remain there. She has also worked for justice for her brothers. Abdullah Khadr was detained in Pakistan and resisted extradition to the United States; he finally returned to Canada in 2005. Abdurahman Khadr was also detained, but he had claimed to have been working for the United States CIA when he was held as a detainee in Guantanamo Bay detention camp, 2002–2003. In October 2010, her youngest brother Omar Khadr pleaded guilty to charges in a plea agreement, and was repatriated to Canada in 2012 to serve the rest of his eight-year sentence.

On January 31, 2016, Michelle Shephard and Peter Edwards, writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, reported that Zaynab had been apprehended, in Turkey for a visa violation.

In August 2017, it was reported that she lived in Sudan with her husband and four children, but by December 2018 she had moved to Georgia.

====Early life and education====

Zaynab Khadr was born in Ottawa, Ontario in 1979, the eldest daughter and first child of Maha el-Samnah and Ahmed Khadr, Egyptian-Canadian citizens. Her father was in graduate school.

The family moved to Pakistan in 1985, where her father worked for charities assisting Afghan refugees after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The children went to school there and were also home schooled by their mother. Zaynab has five younger brothers: Abdullah, Abdurahman, Abdulkareem (known as Kareem), Ismail (died), and Omar, and a younger sister.

In July 1995, her father arranged for the 15-year-old Zaynab to marry Khalid Abdullah, an Egyptian, in December. Her mother began preparing an apartment for the couple in the family&#x27;s house in Pakistan.

On November 19, 1995, Ayman al-Zawahiri bombed the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan. Named as one of the conspirators, Zaynab&#x27;s fiancé Abdullah went into hiding. When police arrived eight days later to arrest her father on suspicion of involvement, Zaynab grabbed his rifle and screamed at them, while her mother barricaded the door.

Zaynab later recalled having celebrated the engagement of her friend Umayma al-Zawahiri at the girl&#x27;s family house in an all-day party. Umayma&#x27;s father, al-Zawahiri, had knocked at Umayma&#x27;s door to ask the two girls to keep their singing and partying quiet as it was nighttime.

====Marriage and family====
In October 1997, Khalid Abdullah re-surfaced in Tehran and contacted the Khadr family to reschedule his wedding with Zaynab. Khadr agreed to take his family on a long vacation, which they ended in Iran. They said farewell to Zaynab, by then reluctant, as she started a new life with Abdullah. Six months after the couple began living in a rented Tehran apartment, Abdullah phoned his father-in-law to report that Zaynab was inconsolable at being separated from her family. The marriage was not working out, and Zaynab returned to live with her family.

In 1999, Zaynab was introduced to Yacoub al-Bahr, a Yemeni who had fought in Bosnia. He was better-known as a wedding singer in Kabul, Afghanistan. Her father asked the boys of the family to vote on whether he should give his consent to the marriage, and did so after Abdurahman and Kareem voiced their enthusiasm; the younger Abdullah and Omar abstained. The wedding was in Kabul. Both al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden attended. Zaynab later explained that nobody was individually invited, and that word of mouth informed interested parties about the open invitation to their upcoming wedding. The couple moved into a separate wing of the Khadr household.

The following year, Zaynab and her mother returned to Canada for several months late in her pregnancy, where she gave birth to a daughter, named Safia. After returning to Afghanistan and introducing her new child to Rabiyah Hutchinson, Zaynab was advised to take her daughter to a doctor. Safia was diagnosed with hydrocephalus and required surgery, which Zaynab decided would be better performed at a Canadian hospital. Her husband disagreed, and insisted that a hospital in Lahore would be just as effective. When Zaynab insisted on taking her daughter to Canada, al-Bahr separated from her and left the household permanently.

In late 2001, Ahmed Khadr encountered al-Bahr in Kabul; he advised him that he should either return to his wife and daughter, or consent to a divorce. After receiving written reassurance from Zaynab that she would not seek any form of restitution, al-Bahr agreed to a formal divorce.

====Life in post-invasion Afghanistan====
In January 2002, Zaynab took Safia and Abdulkareem to Lahore for a stay at the hospital, where her daughter needed medical attention. Her brother Abdullah later joined them, since he required surgery to remove cartilage from his nose.

He disappeared later that year, as did their younger brother Omar, not yet 16; she learned later that they were both being detained by the United States as enemy combatants at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

In 2003, Zaynab, her daughter and her mother stayed at a house in Birmal, Pakistan for two days, before their hosts grew wary of American jets overhead. They moved further into the mountains of Waziristan. Her father was killed in October 2003. Zaynab moved to Islamabad, where she lived for some time in a rented apartment with her daughter and younger sister.

In her book &quot;Wanted Women&quot; Deborah Scroggins describes meeting Zaynab while she was a house-guest of Khalid Khawaja, in Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2004. According to Scroggins, Zaynab told her that the time she lived under the Taliban was &quot;the best five years of my life.&quot;

====Return to Canada====
Although her passport had been revoked by the Canadian High Commission in Pakistan after her father was alleged to be a terrorist, Khadr returned to Canada on February 17, 2005 to be with her mother, and help the legal defence teams of her brothers Abdullah and Omar. Zaynab and her widowed mother Maha are both on passport &quot;control&quot; lists, meaning they will no longer be issued Canadian passports. This is due to the frequency with which they have reported losing their passports since 1999.

When Zaynab returned to Canada, security officials, including Konrad Shourie, met her at the airport bearing a search warrant. It was based on the statement that she &quot;has willingly participated and contributed both directly and indirectly towards enhancing the ability of Al Qaeda.&quot; They seized her laptop, DVDs, audiocassettes, diary and other files. The security officials said that, through the computer files, they were able to determine the present locations of multiple al-Qaeda veterans, though they had no evidence to charge her. Zaynab said she had purchased the computer second-hand seven months before her trip.
On June 18, 2005, after the expiry of the three-month limit on holding the items, the court granted the RCMP a one-year extension.

On October 5, 2009, Isabel Teotonio, writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, reported on the extradition hearing for Zaynab&#x27;s brother Abdullah Khadr. She wrote that Canadian officials had seized a hard drive from Zaynab that had belonged to her father. Although Zaynab has indicated a desire to one day return to Pakistan, her Canadian passport remained withheld, for many years, rendering her unable to leave the country. According to Mark Steyn, after the death of Osama bin Laden, Zaynab Khadr was &quot;disconsolate at the death of Osama, and has adopted his mugshot as the photo for her Facebook page.&quot;

====Apprehension in Turkey====
According to a January 2016 report from Michelle Shephard and Peter Edwards, in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Zaynab left Canada, for Turkey, in 2012, shortly after her brother Omar was returned to Canada, to finish out his sentence. They reported that she married again, for a fourth time, and bore two more children.

They reported that they had learned she was being held in Turkey.
They noted that Turkey had been criticized by human rights workers for holding tens of thousands of individuals, without charge. They noted that they didn&#x27;t know why she was being held, whether it was over a criminal concern, or an immigration matter; and they didn&#x27;t know whether she had been formally charged, or was being held in extrajudicial detention. It was subsequently reported that her detention was due to a visa violation.

The &quot;National Post&quot; reported Turkish diplomats, in Ottawa, would not comment on her case.

After her release, Khadr moved to Sudan where she lived with her fourth husband and four children, before moving again to Georgia.

====Advocacy====
In 2004, Zaynab appeared in a &quot;PBS Frontline&quot; documentary entitled &quot;Son of al Qaeda,&quot; during which she said concerning the September 11th attacks:

Most news stories reported only that she had supported the attacks, mobilizing public sentiment against the family. Zaynab has worked to arrange legal support for other Canadians accused of militant actions in the war on terror, notably attending the bail hearings and preliminaries for the men and youths arrested in Toronto in 2006. Her presence has caused a stir in the media, while she maintains that many of the accused were friends of the family.

In July 2008 clips from secret surveillance recordings at Guantanamo of Omar&#x27;s first visit from Canadian officials were made public. The clips stirred controversy, as they showed Omar being pleased, when he thought he was finally going to get help from Canadian officials; and they showed him weeping uncontrollably when he realized these Canadian officials were security officials, interested only in helping the CIA utilize him as an intelligence source against the Al-Qaeda terrorist network. &quot;Global TV&quot; interviewed Zaynab and her mother who described being &quot;devastated&quot; by Omar&#x27;s distress.

In October 2008, Zaynab began an 18-day hunger strike on Parliament Hill, where she hoped to draw attention to the government&#x27;s inaction in bringing her brother Abdurahman back to face trial in Canada.

Her brother Omar Khadr was released to Canadian custody at the end of 2012. In 2014, he was moved to a medium-security prison and released in May 2015. On July 4, 2017, an unnamed government source leaked that the Canadian government would apologize and pay $10.5 million in compensation to Khadr. The decision of Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government to award Omar Khadr, an alleged former member of Al-Qaeda convicted of murder (notably, as a minor), with these funds has been highly controversial in the country, igniting resentment and outrage in a segment of the Canadian population.

==Location==
Ahmed Khadr went to college in Canada, where he met and married Maha el-Samnah. They moved to Pakistan in 1985 to work with Afghan refugees following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

In 1992, the family returned to Canada and lived near Bloor/Dundas following an incident in Afghanistan that left the father Ahmed disabled and needing rehabilitation. The family later left and returned to Pakistan. In 1995, Ahmed Khadr was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the bombing of the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan, but was later released.

During this time, the family stayed at Nazim Jihad, the home of Osama bin Laden in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. They stayed at the compound the following year during the father&#x27;s absence. The family claims they stayed two days, while the FBI maintains they stayed for a month.

The family subsequently moved to the Karte Parwan neighbourhood of Kabul and lived there from 1999–2001. The Khadrs were registered as operators of a Canadian charity, and eventually did their work out of their home.

Following the Invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the family joined a convoy leaving Kabul to travel towards Gardez. They later discovered that their intended residence had been bombed.

The family then traveled to an orphanage that Ahmed Khadr had run. They eventually moved in with a Pashtun family in a hut in the mountains, where Ahmed visited monthly.

==Controversy==
In 2002, Omar Khadr was captured in Afghanistan and was detained at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp for approximately ten years. His brother Abdurahman Khadr had been arrested and worked as an undercover informant with the CIA while at Guantanamo, and later continued to work undercover in Bosnia.

Ahmed Khadr was killed in 2003 near the Afghanistan border by what has been described in various sources as Pakistan security forces or a US drone. On April 9, 2004, Maha and Abdulkareem used the family&#x27;s savings to return to Canada; The politicians Stockwell Day, Bob Runciman and John Cannis were among those in a public outcry calling for the Khadrs&#x27; citizenship to be revoked, and for the pair to be deported. Others suggested it was unfair to revoke citizenship from people who held views contrary to the government or majority.

Some Canadians complained that the Khadrs had &quot;taken advantage of&quot; Canada, living off its social services, while decrying it as a morally corrupted country. Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty dissented, stating that the province would recognise the family&#x27;s right to Ontario Health Insurance Plan medical coverage and to be treated like any other Canadian family.

In 2005, following the oldest daughter Zaynab&#x27;s return to the country, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer Konrad Shourie said, &quot;The entire family is affiliated with al Qaeda and has participated in some form or another with these criminal extremist elements&quot;.

A noted friend of the family, former Pakistani Air Force officer and ISI agent Khalid Khawaja, spoke in their defense; he said that they were being unfairly targeted by Canadian authorities because of a deference to the United States (who held their youngest son), and Islamophobia. Since returning to Canada, the Khadr family has been described as &quot;poverty-stricken&quot;.

In their 2008 report concerning Mahmoud Jaballah, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) stated that Omar and his older brother Abdulkareem attended terror training camps. In late October 2010, Omar Khadr pleaded guilty to charges against him in a plea agreement before a Military Commission at Guantanamo, admitting to having received &quot;one-on-one terrorist training from an al-Qaeda operative and that he threw the grenade that killed U.S. Sergeant Christopher Speer&quot;. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, in addition to the time already served. In 2012, he was repatriated to Canada to serve the remainder of his sentence.

==Representation in other media==
* &quot;Son of Al-Qaeda&quot;, 2008, &quot;PBS Frontline&quot; documentary featuring Abdurahman Khadr, also included conversations with other members of his family. Transcript and excerpts from interviews available at website.

<text>The &quot;FIRST&quot; Lego League Challenge (formerly known as &quot;FIRST&quot; Lego League) is an international competition organized by &quot;FIRST&quot; for elementary and middle school students (ages 9–14 in the United States and Canada, 9-15 elsewhere).

Each year in August, FIRST Lego League Challenge teams are introduced to a scientific and real-world challenge for teams to focus and research on. The robotics part of the competition involves designing and programming Lego Education robots to complete tasks. The students work out a solution to a problem related to the theme (changes every year) and then meet for regional, national and international tournaments to compete, share their knowledge, compare ideas, and display their robots.

The &quot;FIRST&quot; Lego League Challenge is a partnership between &quot;FIRST&quot; and the Lego Group. It is the third division of FIRST Lego League, following FIRST Lego League Discover for ages 4-6, and FIRST Lego League Explore for ages 6-10.

==Competition details==

At the beginning of the competition season, &quot;FIRST&quot; sends a set of official competition materials to each registered team, consisting of a &#x27;challenge mat&#x27;, LEGO electronic and mechanical components, and instructions for building the items for the mat (collectively known as the Challenge Set, formerly the Field Setup Kit). The teams also receive a list of tasks, called &#x27;missions&#x27;, to complete involving each model on the mat (e.g. taking a loose piece from one model and placing it inside another). The &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge gives teams complete freedom on how to complete the missions, providing that they are completed by a programmed LEGO Education robot with no outside assistance. The robot has two and a half minutes to complete the missions; called the &quot;Robot Game&quot;. Each team has a minimum build period of 8 weeks to analyze the challenge mat, design and build a LEGO Education robot, and program it to fulfill the given missions in any manner they see fit. The robot must be autonomous, and may contain only one LEGO Education programmable block and no more than four motors.

In addition to the live robot run, or &quot;Robot Game&quot;, the competition has three additional judged sections with the purpose of providing teams with feedback on their achievement of the &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge learning objectives. The first judging session, &quot;Core Values&quot;, is designed to determine how the team works together and uses the &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Core Values in everything they do, which include inspiration, teamwork, &quot;Gracious Professionalism&quot;, and &quot;Coopertition&quot;. In addition to discussing how their team exhibits these values, teams may also be asked to perform a teamwork activity, usually timed, to see how the team works together to solve a new problem. Secondly, in the &quot;Robot Design&quot;, or &quot;technical&quot; judging, the team demonstrates the mechanical design, programming, and strategy/innovation of their robot. The goal of this judging session is to see what the robot “should” do during the Robot Game. Thirdly, in the &quot;Project&quot;, the students must give a 5-minute presentation on the research of a topic related to the current challenge. The required steps of the project as teams to first identify a problem that is related to the topic of that year&#x27;s competition, then create an innovative solution to their identified problem by modifying something that already exists or creating something completely new (an &quot;innovative solution&quot;), and then they must share that solution with others, such as real-world professionals who have expertise in the annual challenge theme.

===Table performance===

When the official competition convenes, each team brings their robot to compete on an official challenge mat identical to their own. Two team members are allowed at the board during a match; however, they can switch out with others in the team. In the case of a serious problem, such as the entire robot breaking down, the entire team is allowed at the board for as long as the problem persists. Members are not permitted to bring additional robots or any other items to the board during the competition.

The robot starts in an area marked as &#x27;base&#x27;, a white area in the corner or to one side of the table. While at base, two team members are allowed to touch the robot and start programs. If the team touches the robot outside of base (an &#x27;interruption&#x27;), the referee will issue a penalty, resulting in the removal of a Precision Token. These are stationary LEGO models that increase the final score if they remain until the end, providing an incentive to not interrupt the robot. The robot is not required to return to base; some teams have completed all their missions without returning to base during the time allowed to complete the missions. In fact, in the 2008–09, 2009–10, 2011-13 and 2021 challenges, points were awarded if the robot was in one of two specified areas, not including base, at the end of the two and a half minute match.

===Parts and Robotic platforms===

&quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge teams may use &quot;any LEGO-made building parts in their original factory condition&quot; to construct their robots. The robots are programmed using any language allowing autonomous movement. Many teams opt for a block-based programming environment such as the official EV3 software, the official NXT-G software (now outdated), or Robolab. All these are built around Labview.

The robots used are Lego Education units. Until 2021, the platform of choice was the Lego Mindstorm EV3. While the EV3 will still be permitted in FLL competitions, starting in August 2022, the Guided Mission will only be available for SPIKE Prime.

==Events==
Teams in different parts of the world have different times allotted to complete the construction of the robot due to the varying date of qualifying tournaments but must have a minimum of 8 weeks from &quot;Global Challenge Release&quot; (the date, usually in August, by which the details of the missions and research project become available to the public). They go on to compete in &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge tournaments, similar to the &quot;FIRST&quot; Robotics Competition regionals. The initial levels of competition are managed by an Affiliate Partner Organization (commonly affiliated Universities), who are led by an Affiliate or Operational Partner Representative (&quot;The Partner&quot;). The Partner has complete control over all official tournaments in their region. Region boundaries are set by &quot;FIRST&quot;. Some States represent an entire region, while others, like Central Florida, represent a mix of Counties within the State. Most Partners have a two-tier system; teams first go to a &quot;Qualifier&quot;, and if they meet certain criteria and perform well in all three judged areas, they can receive a bid to advance to the next level of competition, which is most often a Regional-Level event. Certain territories have 3-tiers and may also employ a State Championship.

The largest single-day regional qualifying tournament is hosted by First State Robotics and First State &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League in Wilmington, Delaware. Taking place every January, this event holds &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Explore, &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge, &quot;FIRST&quot; Tech Challenge, &quot;FIRST&quot; Robotics Competition, and robot sumo competitions under one roof at the University of Delaware&#x27;s Bob Carpenter Center. Teams from Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland (among other regions) attend this tournament to make it the largest single-day &quot;FIRST&quot; event in the world.

===&quot;FIRST&quot; Championship ===
The only competition run by &quot;FIRST&quot; is the &quot;FIRST&quot; Championship In 2007, 96 teams competed in the &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League World Festival in Atlanta, Georgia on April 27–30. The 2007–08 Power Puzzle &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League World Festival and the 2008–09 &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League World Festival on Climate Connections were held again in the Georgia Dome and Georgia World Congress Center. Starting with 2010–11, &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League World Festival is held at the Edward Jones Dome and America&#x27;s Center in St. Louis. In 2016, &quot;FIRST&quot; announced that they were expanding the &quot;FIRST&quot; Championship to two back-to-back events. Through 2020, these events will be held first in Houston, Texas at the George R. Brown Convention Center and the following week in Detroit, Michigan at the Cobo Center.

Additionally, top-performing teams from the highest level of regional/state competition may be nominated to participate in one of the Open Championships (also called &quot;Invitationals&quot;), which are organized by &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge Partners. 
With the exception of Local Awards (a special recognition designed by that region&#x27;s Partner), the Rookie Award, which recognizes a team for whose this is their first year competing and displayed extraordinary achievements, the Judges Award, which recognizes a team that displays much achievement, but did not qualify for any typical award, and the Robot Performance Award, which recognizes the team with the single highest numeric robot performance score at that particular event, teams are only allowed to win one award at any particular event.

=== Global Innovation Award ===

Officially registered teams can also be nominated by their region for the Global Innovation Award, where they could win a grant to make their innovative solution to the annual challenge theme&#x27;s problem a reality. As of the &quot;Animal Allies&quot; Season, the First Place team wins $20,000 and two other Finalists each win $5,000. The money can be used to further the team&#x27;s ideas or to continue in &quot;FIRST&quot; programs. All three finalist teams also receive a LEGO Mindstorms Education EV3 Robot Set. All submissions are reviewed by a panel of judges consisting of experts from engineering and industrial fields as well as experts in the challenge theme for that year. Teams are judged on problem identification, innovation, implementation, and effective use of STEM principles. From all of the teams nominated by every &quot;FIRST&quot; LEGO League Challenge region, twenty teams are selected as semi-finalists and are invited to attend the Global Innovation Award Celebration in San Jose (formerly in Washington, D.C.) At this event, the teams present to a panel of judges, and the first place and other finalist teams winning the cash prizes are announced.

<text>The scree skink (Oligosoma waimatense) is a species of skink native to several sites throughout the South Island of New Zealand. A member of the family Scincidae, it was described by Geoff Patterson in 1997. It favours rocky habitats, particularly greywacke screes. Threats to scree skinks include predation by introduced mammals, weed encroachment, human interference and (for stream bed populations) severe flood events.

== Conservation status ==
As of 2012 the Department of Conservation (DOC) classified the scree skink as Nationally Vulnerable under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

<doc id="970173" wikidata="Q910501" url="?curid=970173" title="Otago skink">
<text>The Otago skink (Oligosoma otagense) is a rare, endangered species of large skink in the family Scincidae, found in the rocky canyons and grassy patches of Central Otago, New Zealand.

==Physical characteristics==
Otago skinks are large compared to other New Zealand skinks, growing up to . They are marked with distinctive black, yellow, and green spots, which provides excellent camouflage in their rocky habitat of lichen-covered rocks and schist outcrops. Juveniles have more of a yellow base with dark blotches and shorter limbs. Like most skinks, Otago skinks are omnivores and feed on a wide variety of insects, fleshy fruits, flower petals, or even other small reptiles. They are long-lived, reaching around 16 years in the wild and up to 40 years in captivity, and are slow to mature, reaching sexual maturity at 3–4 years. Unlike many reptiles, this species is viviparous, with embryos developing in the mother&#x27;s body, who then gives birth to live young. Between one and three young are born between January and March.

==Distribution and habitat==
Otago skinks are only found in very specific locations in Otago. Most are found in eastern Otago, between Macreas Flat and Sutton, usually up to 1,000 meters in elevation. There is also a smaller population in western Otago between Lake Hāwea and Lindis Pass. The combined range is nearly 860 mi2. Although the two populations are morphologically similar, there has been speculation as to whether they have undergone genetic divergence. A phylogeographic analysis found a separation in lineages but that gene flow was still occurring in neighboring locations, and suggested that the two regions be assessed and treated separately.

Although individuals occasionally are found in the surrounding tussocks, the skinks are typically limited to the large schist rock outcroppings found in that region. They can often be seen sunning themselves on these rocks to regulate body temperature and seek refuge in the deep crevices when alarmed, at night and on cold days.

An estimate from 2001 found that the range of the Otago skink had decreased by roughly 90% over the last 100 years, presumably driven by land use changes, particularly the intensification of farming, and the introduction of mammalian predators.

==Conservation==

The Otago skink has been assessed as Endangered by the IUCN, based on its very limited range and low total population. As of 2012 the Department of Conservation (DOC) has classified the Otago Skink as Nationally Critical under the New Zealand Threat Classification System, and research into conservation management is ongoing.

Most threats to the species seem to derive from anthropogenic sources. Agriculture and mining have over time taken up much of its habitat, altering the landscape and removing food sources and cover. This was compounded by the introduction of mammalian predators. The Otago skink, having historically been exposed to only limited predation from native birds, was heavily impacted by the spread of house cats, rabbits, ferrets, and weasels in conjunction with the increasing lack of sheltering habitats.

Anthropogenic threats appear to be combining with natural traits suich as low productivity and late sexual maturity to inhibit the recovery of the species. Additionally, the skink currently requires a specialised habitat, leaving the populations isolated and small with virtually no room for relocation or expanding.

Conservation efforts consisting of habitat protection, predator-proof fencing and predator control have been in force for some time. A management trial was developed in 2005 that lead to a major population recovery. Habitat conservation, predator control, and program monitoring became major objectives and have since proven successful, as skink numbers are slowly increasing. The Otago skink is currently fully protected under New Zealand law. DOC aims to continue efforts for management in situ, but some captive management has been carried out by breeders, conservation organizations, and zoos to ensure preservation from natural catastrophe. At one point, it was estimated that the species would become functionally extinct; work to protect the population has made this less likely, but the species is still considered to be at risk of extinction.

<text>Mount Crescent is a mountain located in the Crescent Range of the White Mountains in Randolph, New Hampshire. It is 3,251 ft (991 m) high, and its summit is the second highest mountain summit in Randolph, after Black Crescent Mountain (3,264 feet, 995 m). Both mountains are in Randolph&#x27;s Ice Gulch Town Forest. On the 1896 topographic map, Mount Crescent is shown as &quot;Randolph Mtn.&quot; with an elevation of 3,280 ft, and Black Crescent is shown as &quot;Mt. Crescent&quot; with an elevation of 3,322 ft.

The southeast side of Mount Crescent drains into Moose Brook, thence into the Androscoggin River, which drains into Merrymeeting Bay, the estuary of the Kennebec River, and thence into the Gulf of Maine. 
The southwest end of Mt. Crescent drains into Carlton Brook, thence into the Moose River, a different stream which is also a tributary of the Androscoggin River. 
The northwest side of Crescent drains into the Upper Ammonoosuc River, thence into Connecticut River, which drains into Long Island Sound in Connecticut.

Mount Crescent may be reached by hiking trails from either the north, via Pond of Safety Road (sometimes shown as Stag Hollow Road) and Bog Dam Road, or from the south, via Randolph Hill Road.

<text>Shlomo Riskin (born May 28, 1940) is an Orthodox rabbi, and the founding rabbi of Lincoln Square Synagogue on the Upper West Side of New York City, which he led for 20 years; founding chief rabbi of the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the Israeli-occupied West Bank; former dean of Manhattan Day School in New York City; and founder and Chancellor of the Ohr Torah Stone Institutions, a network of high schools, colleges, and graduate Programs in the United States and Israel. 

==Early career==
Shlomo Riskin was born on May 28, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York. He attended the Yeshiva of Brooklyn, and graduated valedictorian, summa cum laude, from Yeshiva University in 1960, where he received rabbinic ordination under the guidance of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik. In 1963, Riskin received his master&#x27;s degree in Jewish history, and he completed a Ph.D. from New York University in 1982. From 1963 until 1977, he lectured and served as an Associate Professor of Tanakh and Talmud at Yeshiva University in New York City.

At the age of 23, Riskin became the founding rabbi of Lincoln Square Synagogue in New York City and served in that position until 1983. Rabbi Riskin transformed the Conservative minyan into one of New York&#x27;s most innovative and dynamic Orthodox communities. The synagogue became particularly well known for its pioneering outreach programs which inspired many secular people to become religiously observant Orthodox Jews.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he became a leader of the movement to allow free, unfettered emigration for persecuted Soviet Jews and made several trips to visit and strengthen the Jewish communities in the then USSR. He was the chairman of Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, the first American national movement to free Russian Jews.

==Immigration and after==
In 1983, Riskin immigrated to the Israeli settlement of Efrat in the Israeli-occupied West Bank with his family, where he became the founding Chief Rabbi, a position he held until 2020. Over the years, he was joined by many former members of his New York congregation. In Israel, Riskin has established a network of high schools, colleges, graduate programs, seminaries and rabbinical schools under the name Ohr Torah Stone Institutions with a total student enrollment numbering in the thousands.

Riskin has dedicated himself to training a new generation of leaders for the Orthodox Jewish world. To this end, he established a Rabbinical Seminary and Practical Rabbinics Program to prepare young men with the scholarship and practical skills to become effective spiritual leaders, teachers and spokesmen for Orthodox Judaism. Riskin now has hundreds of former students serving as rabbis and educators in Israel and throughout the world.

He has also pioneered the rights of women in the world of Orthodox Judaism. He broadened women&#x27;s participation in public religious practices, and declared that women could hold their own celebration of Simhat Torah. He co-founded a women&#x27;s college, Midreshet Lindenbaum (originally named Michlelet Bruria), a prominent seminary for Orthodox women. In 2014, the first-ever book of halachic decisions written by women who were ordained to serve as poskim (Idit Bartov and Anat Novoselsky) was published. The women were ordained by Riskin, after completing Midreshet Lindenbaum women&#x27;s college five-year ordination course in advanced studies in Jewish law, as well as passing examinations equivalent to the rabbinate&#x27;s requirement for men. In addition, in 2021 he supported the appointment of an additional graduate of this program Rabbanit Shira Marili Mirvis as the spiritual leader of the Shirat HaTamar synagogue in Efrat. Marili Mirvis is the first woman to serve as the sole leader of an Orthodox congregation in Israel.

In 1991, Riskin issued a challenge in Israel&#x27;s High Court to the laws which prevented women from serving as &quot;Toanot&quot; - advocates in the Rabbinical Court. Riskin won the case and established the first program for the training of women advocates in the religious courts. Graduates of the program now defend the rights of Agunot (women whose husbands refuse to grant them a divorce) in the religious courts, helping them to secure a &quot;Get&quot; (bill of religious divorce). Riskin is an advocate of prenuptial agreements as a solution for the problem of recalcitrant husbands.

Parallel to these institutions, Riskin also established the first ever programs for young men and women from the Diaspora with severe learning and developmental difficulties to spend a year studying Torah in Israel while also gaining vocational training.

Riskin is a forceful spokesperson for Jews and Israel, and against anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. As an advocate of religious and cultural tolerance, he has worked to promote good relations with the leaders of the Palestinian villages surrounding the Efrat settlement.

In 2008, Riskin established the Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation, or CJCUC, the first Orthodox Jewish institution to dialogue with the Christian world on a religious and theological basis. The center, currently located in Jerusalem, engages in Hebraic Bible Study for Christians, from both the local community and from abroad, has organized numerous interfaith praise initiatives, such as &quot;Day to Praise&quot;, and has established many fund-raising initiatives such as &quot;Blessing Bethlehem&quot; which aim to aid the persecuted Christian community of Bethlehem, in part, and the larger persecuted Christian community of the Middle East region and throughout the world. Since Riskin&#x27;s retirement as president of Ohr Torah Stone in 2018, the overseeing of all CJCUC activities has been turned over to David Nekrutman who has served as the center&#x27;s chief director since its inception.

In 2018, Riskin was awarded the Bonei Zion (Builders of Zion) Prize for outstanding achievements in Education.

==Controversy==

Rabbi Riskin&#x27;s term as Chief Rabbi of Efrat was extended by five years on June 28, 2015, after a month-long controversy in which the Chief Rabbinate was allegedly planning to retire him at age 75 because of his religious views on the advancement of women in Orthodoxy and an inclusive approach towards conversion.

Rabbi Riskin was accused of comparing U.S. President Barack Obama to the antagonist of the Book of Esther, Haman, in a March 28, 2015, speech in the Great Synagogue in Jerusalem.

In April 2015, Riskin&#x27;s launching of the Day to Praise interfaith joint praise initiative caused an uproar within the Haredi and other conservative-Orthodox Jewish circles. In a statement, the once chief Sephardi Rabbi of Israel, and the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Rabbi Shlomo Amar, expressed his &quot;stomach churning&quot; in light of the joint Hallel prayer of Jews and Christians in a synagogue in Jerusalem being led by Rabbi Riskin. In a rebuttal, Rabbi Riskin defended his actions, stating that, &quot;We are talking about a thanksgiving prayer to G-d that would include Christians who worship His actions towards the Jewish people and the Land of Israel... What could possibly be more appropriate?&quot; 

In 2010, Riskin appeared in a video where he referenced Jesus with a title of Rabbi, and called Jesus a &quot;model Rabbi&quot;, referring to the historical origins of Jesus as a Jew, and not of the modern perception of Jesus. Many took Riskin&#x27;s statements out of context, claiming that Riskin&#x27;s statements are incompatible with mainstream theologies in other forms of Judaism. Riskin explained in an additional statement that a poor edit to the video left out his explanation elaborating upon the fundamental differences between the religions, and the historical context within which his statements were made.

<doc id="970189" wikidata="Q6837847" url="?curid=970189" title="Michigan v. Long">
<text>Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032 (1983), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court that extended &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, to allow searches of car compartments during a stop with &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;. The case also clarified and narrowed the extent of adequate and independent state ground, allowing U.S. Supreme Court review of state supreme court decisions unless they explicitly appealed to state laws.

==Background==
David Long was questioned by police after driving his car off a road and into a shallow ditch in Barry County, Michigan. Officers said he acted erratically and that he, &quot;appeared to be under the influence of something.&quot; Noticing a hunting knife on the floor of the car, they conducted a &quot;Terry&quot; protective patdown (named after &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;), but they turned up no weapons. They then conducted a &quot;protective search&quot; of the car with the same justification: searching for weapons. Inside the car, police found an exposed bag of marijuana. In the trunk they found approximately more, and Long was arrested for drug possession.

===Procedural history===
Long argued during his trial that the evidence found in his car should be suppressed because the search was unconstitutional. The same argument was advanced during his appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals. In each case, the court ruled against suppressing the evidence.

However, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed these rulings. Relying largely on federal precedent, especially &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the &quot;protective search&quot; violated the Fourth Amendment, and thus the &quot;poisonous fruit&quot; of the illegal search must be discarded.

Additionally, the Michigan Supreme Court grounded its decision on article 1, section 11 of the Michigan Constitution. It argued that the search violated both federal and state constitutions, suggesting that if the federal ruling was overturned the presumably more rigorous ruling from the Michigan Constitution would survive. Precedent from &quot;Murdock v. City of Memphis&quot;, 87 U.S. 590 (1874) and other cases established that the U.S. Supreme Court could not review state cases if there was adequate and independent state ground. That is, state supreme courts are the last word on interpreting state constitutions and laws. The Supreme Court, however, found that the lower court&#x27;s opinion did not indicate that its decision rested on grounds in any way independent from its interpretation of federal law. Apart from two citations to the Michigan Constitution, the state court relied exclusively on its understanding of federal law.

==Decision==
The Supreme Court not only ruled that Michigan misapplied &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; and the Fourth Amendment but also ruled that &quot;Long&quot; had insufficient adequate and independent state ground. O&#x27;Connor, a former judge on the Arizona Court of Appeals, affirmed the doctrine of independent state ground, but wrote that the Michigan Supreme Court adjudicated almost exclusively from federal law. Thus, the Court &quot;accept[ed] as the most reasonable explanation that the state court decided the case the way it did because it believed that Federal law required it so.&quot; Essentially, the Supreme Court presumed the state decision rested on federal grounds. O&#x27;Connor suggests that state courts write &quot;clearly and expressly&quot; that their decision rests on &quot;bona fide&quot; state grounds. Should they do this, the U.S. Supreme Court would &quot;not undertake to review the decision.&quot;

One solution is that state courts may rule their own constitution &quot;in parallel&quot; with the U.S. Constitution. That is, they take Federal case law, especially if it is to their liking, as &quot;advisory,&quot; but they make clear that federal law is not considered by the court precedent. In this way, state courts can protect individual rights at a very high level as the late Justice Brennan suggested.

Although this opinion helped clarify what had theretofore been ambiguous, some critics charged that &quot;Michigan v. Long&quot; was politically motivated. Justice Stevens, for example, enumerated the ways the US Supreme Court had previously handled such ambiguities. Predominantly, the Court sent cases back down for clarification, but in &quot;Long&quot; they ruled directly against it without awaiting clarification. Presumably, the more conservative Burger court sought to reverse the liberal Michigan decision.

<text>The TVR Speed Twelve engine is the name of a V12 engine manufactured by TVR for use in the TVR Speed 12 race car, and later the TVR Cerbera Speed Twelve road car.

The engine was developed by essentially joining two Speed Six engine blocks to a common crankshaft. However it featured a revised cylinder head design with bucket valve actuation in place of the Speed Six&#x27;s finger follower system. The completed engine displaced 7.7 litres and was originally developed for racing applications in TVR&#x27;s Speed Twelve. Later on, a version was developed for the prototype of a road car to be called the Cerbera Speed Twelve.

Unusually for an automobile, the Speed Twelve&#x27;s engine block was not constructed of cast iron or aluminum alloy, but rather of welded steel construction.

The racing version of the engine produced approximately with its power limited by the intake restrictors required by racing regulations. For the road-version of the engine, the restrictors were not needed so the engine was developed without them. According to reports from TVR engineers, the de-restricted engine snapped the central shaft of their -rated dynamometer during the bench-test. The engine&#x27;s output was later estimated at , though the official figure given by TVR was . When the prototype vehicle was road-tested by then-owner Peter Wheeler, he reportedly concluded that the vehicle was too powerful to be practical and the project was scrapped.

<text>A technology demonstration (or tech demo), also known as demonstrator model, is a prototype, rough example or otherwise incomplete version of a conceivable product or future system, put together as proof of concept with the primary purpose of showcasing the possible applications, feasibility, performance and method of an idea for a new technology. They can be used as demonstrations to the investors, partners, journalists or even to potential customers in order to convince them of the viability of the chosen approach, or to test them on ordinary users.

==Computers and gaming==
Technology demonstrations are often used in the computer industry, emerging as an important tool in response to short development cycles in software and hardware development.

* Computer game developers use tech demos to rouse and maintain interest to titles still in development (because game engines are usually ready before the art is finished) and to ensure functionality by early testing. Short segments using finished game engines may be presented as game demos.
* Graphics cards manufacturers use tech demos to showcase the performance of their cards even before any games can deliver that performance or before the product is ready to be used outside of the development labs. In November 2002, Nvidia started the practice of featuring realistic characters in graphics card technology demos, by releasing Dawn for its GeForce FX card. The demo featured a forest fairy with semi-realistic short hair and beautiful wings. Later, Nvidia followed with similar, new demos and ATI Technologies joined the race.
* Being by nature much less complex than complete games (that have to include dynamic physics modelling, audio engines, etc.), technology demos for graphics can deliver substantially better image quality, making the general look of games lag several years behind video card technology demos. For example, the PlayStation 2 demos &quot;Namco Girl&quot; (a lifelike female character from &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; winking flirtatiously at viewers) and &quot;older man&quot; used all the processing power to produce a high-quality single-character model, in a static environment. Xbox trailers showed Raven, a buff woman and her robot, showing off martial art moves.

Computer technology demos should not be confused with demoscene-based demos, which, although often demonstrating new software techniques, are regarded as a stand-alone form of computer art.

===Google Tech Demo===

* Demo Slam, a website from Google Inc., was a large collection of technology demonstration videos uploaded by users, and Google employees as well.

===Sales engineering technology demonstration===
Sales Engineering staff, often bearing the title Sales Engineer or Presales Consultant, will prepare technology demonstrations for business meetings or seminars to show capabilities of business products. This can include both software and hardware products, and can show multiple products integrating together. Usually, a demonstration is less than a Proof of concept, but can come some of the way to showing how a business project may be justified. Large companies with tens or hundreds of Sales Engineers will often have a team who specialize in the production of demonstration systems and plans.

<doc id="970201" wikidata="Q760014" url="?curid=970201" title="Edge of Darkness (1943 film)">
<text>Edge of Darkness (a.k.a. Norway in Revolt) is a 1943 World War II film directed by Lewis Milestone that features Errol Flynn, Ann Sheridan, and Walter Huston. The feature is based on a script written by Robert Rossen which was adapted from the 1942 novel &quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; by William Woods.

==Plot==
Norway, 1942. In the Nazi-occupied fishing village of Trollness, Dr. Martin Stensgard and his wife hold on to the pretense of gracious living and ignore the occupiers. The doctor would also prefer to stay neutral, but is torn. Kaspar Torgersen, his brother-in-law, the wealthy owner of the local fish cannery, collaborates with the Nazis. However, the doctor&#x27;s daughter, Karen, is a resistance member, romantically involved with its leader, Gunnar Brogge. Complicating matters further, the doctor&#x27;s son, Johann, has just returned from school in Oslo. Unfortunately, he comes under the influence of his Nazi-sympathizer uncle. Though she loves her brother, Karen makes it known to the townsfolk that Johann is a Quisling.

A key group of resistance members, headed by Gunnar and Karen, anxiously await a secret arrival of arms from a British submarine. They hide the weapons in a cellar and call upon the townsfolk to delay violence until the opportune moment. One evening, Karen, on her way to a meeting, is grabbed by a German soldier and disappears, while Gunnar frantically searches the town for her. She eventually appears at the meeting, clothes torn and face bruised, indicative that she has been raped. Gunnar loses his perspective after seeing what the Germans have done and prepares to attack without delay. But Karen and the others convince him that it is still not yet the time.

After the meeting, Karen&#x27;s father, in anger, murders a German soldier. The Nazi commandant orders all suspected resistance leaders held for public execution. The next morning, they dig their own graves in the town square. Then, they hear singing and discover the townsfolk have armed themselves with the smuggled arsenal. The local pastor fires a machine gun from the church tower, and the townsfolk follow suit. They re-capture their village and load the women and children onto fishing boats bound for England. At the local hotel, which serves as German headquarters, and where Karen&#x27;s brother has moved, preparations are made for defense. Gunnar, Karen, her father, and other resistance members march through the forest toward the hotel. Johann, experiencing a change of heart, warns the rebels from the hotel they are walking into a crossfire trap. The Germans kill Johann, then engage in battle with the rebels, who finally seize the hotel. The Nazi commandant commits suicide. Later, surviving resistance members take to the hills to continue their fight against occupation.

==Production==
===Original Novel===
&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was based on the debut novel of William Woods. Warner Bros. bought the film rights in January 1942 for $30,000. The novel was published on April 9, the second anniversary of the German invasion of Norway.

===Development===
Henry Blanke was assigned to produce, Robert Rossen to write the script and Lewis Milestone to direct. Milestone later told the press:
It is twelve years now since I made &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. That film embodied the retrospective disillusionment toward another war. In &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; we are making a picture that has done away with disillusionment. We know the enemy we are fighting and we are facing the stern realities of the present war. The moral in &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; is that &#x27;united we stand, divided we fall&#x27;. That is the keystone for victory in all the democracies.
&quot;I can&#x27;t think of a story about which I could be more enthusiastic,&quot; said Blanke about &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;.

The job of writing the script was given to Robert Rossen. Milestone later said Rossen &quot;hit on an idiom for the dialogue that had nothing to do with Norway but derived mainly from the language he knew best - the speechways of New York&#x27;s East Side. Since nobody else knew the difference the idiom worked admirably.&quot;

===Casting===
Ann Sheridan and Humphrey Bogart were announced as stars.

Eventually Bogart dropped out and was replaced by Errol Flynn.

The cast included Helmut Dantine who had just signed a long-term contract with Warners following his appearance in &quot;Casablanca&quot;.

There were a large number of actors cast who were best known for their stage work, including Judith Anderson and Ruth Gordon.

Milestone later said &quot;an extremely mixed cast gave some damned good performances.&quot;

===Shooting===
Shooting was to begin in August 1942 but was postponed for two weeks so Errol Flynn could recuperate from bad health. He was meant to do this on his yacht but Hedda Hopper reported he slipped down to Mexico City with a friend for some hunting, and that he &quot;hasn&#x27;t wanted to do it [the film] from the first&quot;, in part because his role was relatively small. Bruce Cabot was listed as a possible replacement if Flynn did not return. Warners pressured Flynn and he eventually returned for filming.

(It was later reported that Flynn had signed a new contract with Warners for four films a year, in one of which he was to also act as producer.)

Most of the film was shot in Warner Bros. studios at Burbank with some exteriors in the town of Monterey. Warners rented two of the biggest piers in Monterey and a fleet of Monterey sailing boats; they lined the streets with Norwegian and Nazi flags and signs and cast several locals as extras. The unit returned from Monterey on September 16 to resume studio shooting.

Erskine Caldwell reportedly operated as a technical adviser on the film because he had some experience of Norway.

During filming, Warners added six grave markers with the names of Nazi saboteurs recently executed in the US, for extra realism. Filming ended in November.

&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was one of several films set in occupied Europe, others being &quot;The Commandos Strike at Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Moon is Down&quot;.

Milestone later said &quot;Flynn kept underrating himself. If you wanted to embarrass him, all you had to do was to tell him how great he was in a scene he&#x27;d just finished playing: he&#x27;d blush like a young girl and muttering &#x27;I&#x27;m not an actor&#x27; would go away somewhere and sit down.&quot;

===Music===
Franz Waxman did the score. He used two main pieces, the Lutheran chorale &quot;A Mighty Fortress is Our God&quot; and the national hymn of Norway. According to one review, &quot;the rest is frankly color orchestration and the necessary filling in. The result is a magnificent build up to an overwhelming emotional climax.&quot;

==Reception==
Contemporary reviews were positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;melodrama [but] strong melodrama, to be sure.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;a dramatic, tense, emotion-stirring story of the ravaging of Norway, superbly acted by a fine cast and firmly directed by Lewis Milestone.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;Excellent! ... Lewis Milestone&#x27;s direction is masterful, and the performances, from the stars to the bit players, are superb.&quot; David Lardner of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; compared the film to &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;, writing that both were worth seeing but that &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; was slightly better due to rounder characterizations. &quot;Filmink&quot; magazine called it &quot;definitely Errol&#x27;s most communist (ish) movie.&quot;

The film was one of the five most requested movies by the US Army in April 1943 - the others being &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, &quot;Hit Parade of 1943&quot;, &quot;Flight for Freedom&quot; and &quot;Hello, Frisco, Hello&quot;. The Sons of Norway organization also arranged special screenings of the film.

After the 1943 Argentine Revolution the pro-Nazi Vice-President Juan Perón banned &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; in Buenos Aires because of its sympathetic portrayal of the Norwegian resistance movement and the unambiguously evil characterization of the Nazi occupiers.

Flynn was to follow the movie with &quot;To the Last Man&quot; (which became &quot;Northern Pursuit&quot;) and &quot;Captain Horatio Hornblower&quot; (which was postponed and then made with Gregory Peck).

===Box Office===
According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $2,039,000 within the U.S. and $1,630,000 abroad.

<text>The Selawik River (Iñupiaq: &quot;Siiḷivium Kuuŋa&quot;; Koyukon: &quot;Nozaatne&quot;) is a stream, long, in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Alaska. Originating in the Purcell Mountains near the Zane Hills, it flows generally west through the Selawik National Wildlife Refuge to Selawik Lake, which empties into the Kotzebue Sound in the Chukchi Sea. The river is approximately at the latitude of the Arctic Circle.

The village of Selawik is along the river near its mouth. The river is used for subsistence fishing by residents and for rafting and sport fishing by tourists.

<text>The White Spider (1959; with chapters added in 1964; original title: Die Weisse Spinne) is a non-fiction book by Heinrich Harrer that describes the first successful ascent of the infamous north face (&quot;Nordwand&quot;) of the Eiger, a mountain in the Berner Oberland of the Swiss Alps, with sections devoted to the history of mountaineering in the area.

==Overview==

&quot;The White Spider&quot; tells the stories of the first attempts to ascend the Eiger&#x27;s North Face, a nearly vertical wall of rock, snow, and ice almost 1,828 metres tall from its base to the mountain&#x27;s 3,967-metre summit, making it the tallest north face in the Alps. Well known for both its technical difficulty and its extreme hazards from avalanches, falling rock, and severe weather, the North Face is also notorious for the many accidents and tragedies that have befallen its climbers, for which it has been given the colloquial epithet &quot;Mordwand&quot; (&quot;murder wall&quot;), a play on &quot;Nordwand&quot; (&quot;north wall&quot;). Harrer recounts in detail all of the first attempts and successes on the Face through the first 25 years of its climbing history, beginning with Max Sedlmayr&#x27;s and Karl Mehringer&#x27;s disastrous try in 1935, through the first successful ascent by a German-Austrian party in 1938, of which Harrer himself was a member, and continuing to the successful ascent by Kurt Diemberger and Wolfgang Stefan in July 1958.

After his successful summit of the mountain, Harrer endeavored to write a history of the early years of climbing on the Face, and received many letters from fellow climbers, which he sifted through with climber and author Kurt Maix to become the contents of &quot;The White Spider&quot;. Harrer describes in particular the tragedy of the 1936 attempt by Edi Rainer, Willy Angerer, Andreas Hinterstoisser, and Toni Kurz, all of whom died during the climb; Harrer&#x27;s own climb, which was the first successful ascent of the North Face; the strenuous but successful climb of Hermann Buhl, Gaston Rébuffat, and their seven companions in 1952; and the catastrophe of 1957, when two Italians, Stefano Longhi and Claudio Corti, joined two Germans, Günther Nothdurft and Franz Mayer – which resulted in eight bivouac nights on the wall of the mountain for the Italians and the death of all but Corti. Harrer&#x27;s account of the 1957 tragedy was the subject of much controversy when published and is no longer considered historically accurate. In the book, Harrer also describes the media frenzy that ensued after each of the tragedies because the whole of the mountain&#x27;s Nordwand can be watched by telescope from nearby Kleine Scheidegg.

==Book title==
The title of the book is derived from a spider-shaped ice field high on the north face of the mountain, towering above the town of Grindelwald. As Harrer describes, and the climbers discovered, the White Spider is the key to a successful ascent of the Nordwand. Although physically exhausted by the time they reach that point, climbers must navigate the steep ice-field to reach the peak&#x27;s summit. The White Spider acts as a funnel, with rock and ice slides channelled through the ice field, putting the climbers in great danger while on the field.

<doc id="970223" wikidata="Q367772" url="?curid=970223" title="Supertrain">
<text>Supertrain is an American science fiction adventure drama television series that ran on NBC from February 7 to May 5, 1979. Nine episodes were made, including a two-hour pilot episode.

==Premise==
The series takes place on the &quot;Supertrain&quot;, a nuclear-powered high speed train that is equipped with amenities more appropriate to a cruise ship. It has luxuries such as a swimming pool, shopping centers, a gym, a library, a medical center, and a discotheque. It is so big it has to run on very broad gauge track. Though it had a rated top speed of , and cruised at , the train took 36 hours to go from New York City to Los Angeles, which would put the train&#x27;s average speed at around , slower than the moderately-paced Amtrak Acela Express and well below the speeds of bullet trains in Europe and Asia; however, the first few episodes establish that Supertrain does not go directly from New York to Los Angeles, stopping in Chicago and Denver as well as an unnamed stop somewhere in Texas.

Much like its contemporary &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, the plots concerned the passengers&#x27; social lives, usually with multiple intertwining storylines. &quot;Supertrain&quot; was described in a 1979 &quot;Variety&quot; review, &quot;It&#x27;s a &#x27;Love Boat&#x27; on wheels which has yet to get on track.&quot; Most of the cast of a given episode were guest stars. The production was elaborate, with huge sets and two high-tech model trains for outside shots.

==Production troubles==
&quot;Supertrain&quot; was the most expensive series ever aired in the United States at the time. The production was beset by problems, including a model train that crashed. NBC paid $10 million for a total of three sets of trains: a full-size train with enormous passenger cars measuring , and two model train sets at 1:9.6 and 1:48 scales for outside shots. While the series was heavily advertised during the 1978-1979 season, it received poor reviews and low ratings, with 16.24 million viewers watching its premiere. The 2-hour premiere was out-rated by a 2-hour special of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and received a 21.8 rating and 32 share, ranking it 17th for the week. Despite attempts to salvage the show by replacing its producer, reworking the cast and the show&#x27;s genre to a sitcom-like format, and a timeslot change from Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. to Saturdays at 10:00 p.m., it went off the air after only three months. NBC, which had produced the show itself, with help from &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; producer Dan Curtis, was unable to recoup its losses from the high production costs. This, combined with the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics the following season (whose coverage NBC was to have carried, costing the network millions in ad revenue), nearly bankrupted the network. For these reasons, &quot;Supertrain&quot; has been called one of the greatest television flops. The show finished 69th out of 114 shows during the 1978-79 season, with an average 15.7 rating and 25 share. By the end of the series, the show had lost over half its audience with only 7.08 million viewers watching the last episode.

Before the show aired in the U.S., NBC sold it directly to the BBC, the first foreign broadcaster to pick up the series. &quot;For two runs, BBC reportedly coughed up more than $25,000 per hour episode, which if not a record series price in this market is close to it.&quot; The BBC was planning to air &quot;Supertrain&quot; in the fall of 1979, after the series premiered in the U.S. in February. By selling the show to international markets, NBC hoped to offset its own development costs. After the failure of the series in the United States, the BBC never aired the show.

== Reception ==
In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Supertrain&quot; number 28 on its &quot;50 Worst TV Shows of All Time&quot; list.

In the May 19, 1979, edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the show received criticism from Robert MacKenzie. He compared the futuristic train to his traditional ideas of a Pullman locomotive and describes the environment as &quot;bigger, gaudier, and noisier, including the passengers.&quot; He described the amenities of the train and the &quot;marvel, cinematically,&quot; of the set design and train itself. Mackenzie found fault with the show&#x27;s reliance on the extravagant train to wow the audience and the lack of character depth or entertaining plot. &quot;When the early ratings proved disappointing, NBC took the series off the air for emergency surgery. The &#x27;All New &quot;Supertrain&quot;&#x27; appeared April 14 looking remarkably like the old &quot;Supertrain&quot;&quot;, which shows NBC&#x27;s attempts to fix the show&#x27;s flaws mid-season. He summarized his opinion on the newly changed episodes by stating, &quot;This tale d-r-a-g-g-e-d even more than previous episodes despite the attempt to glamorize it with models in bikinis and Peter Lawford playing his usual shopworn sophisticate.&quot; In his annual television special later that year, comedian Alan King commented on the show&#x27;s ratings failure: &quot;It&#x27;s a bird! It&#x27;s a bomb! It&#x27;s &quot;Supertrain&quot;!&quot;

&quot;Supertrain&quot; was critiqued by the Telefilm Review in the February 9, 1979, edition of &quot;Variety.&quot; The article begins, &quot;NBC&#x27;s highly-promoted new &quot;Supertrain&quot; series features a slick new train of tomorrow, with a script from yesterday...it seeks to overwhelm, but underwhelms instead.&quot; By emphasizing the train as the main character, the character plots and stories of each episode seem like more of a second thought. Telefilm predicted the show&#x27;s failure in its review: &quot;Without better scripts, the train&#x27;s trek may well end in 13 weeks. More emphasis on characters, less on the train, is in order.&quot; The show lasted just over 12 weeks. The choices of the producer, Dan Curtis, were harshly criticized, saying he was &quot;neglecting characterizations for the sake of camera angles, and his contribution is a sorrowful one.&quot;

==Episodes==
==Home media==
The pilot was released on VHS, as &quot;Express to Terror&quot; in the US, and &quot;Super-Train&quot; in the UK. It was also released in Norway.

<text>Nachman Bulman (also known as Nathan Bulman, 1925-July 6, 2002) was an American rabbi associated with Orthodox Judaism. He was born to Rabbi Meir and Etil Bulman after a blessing from the Rebbe of Ger, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. He grew up on the Lower East Side, Manhattan, and was, for a brief period, part of the circle of the Rebbe of Modzitz, remaining close to the Rebbe until the latter&#x27;s death.

He studied at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS), where obtained his &quot;semicha&quot; (&quot;rabbinical ordination&quot;). Turning down offers from various communities because of inadequate standards, he eventually accepted a position in Danville, Virginia, which had a small Jewish community that he served for three years. Subsequently, he served as a synagogue rabbi and Jewish educator in number of cities in the United States for most of his life. In 1975, he moved to Israel and served as rabbi in Migdal HaEmek starting in 1979. During the last few years of his life he served as rabbi of the Nachliel Synagogue in Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem, where he resided at the time of his death.

==Ideology and impact==
Rabbi Bulman was a student of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik at Yeshiva University where he received his rabbinic ordination. However, in terms of religious ideology, Bulman chose to follow and be identified with Agudath Israel of America, one of Haredi Judaism&#x27;s largest movements. He referred to himself as a disciple of Rabbi Eliyahu Kitov. At a later stage in his life, Bulman sometimes dressed in the style typical of Gerrer Hasidim, even donning a spodik in his later years, on the Sabbath and holidays.

He was a popular teacher, lecturer, writer, translator of Hebrew language works into English, and builder of Jewish communities in both America and Israel.

In the late 1970s, he taught in Israel at Yeshivat Ohr Somayach in Jerusalem serving as its mashgiach ruchani and continued to serve in that capacity after he established a community in Migdal HaEmek. He was seen as a great visionary and was known for understanding modern political events through the lens of timeless Torah wisdom. Often he would compare the events of the weekly Haftorah with current events in his sermons.
He was also a great student of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch&#x27;s teachings and would sometimes incorporate those teachings into his lectures.

After leaving Migdal HaEmek, Bulman again taught at Ohr Sameyach and resided nearby in Maalot Dafna. In 1996 he founded a Beis Midrash, Nachlas Tzvi, in Telz-stone, named after the writings of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch. He strove to teach immigrants and others how to function within Israeli Haredi society without losing their individual identities. During the final three years of his life he lived in Neve Yaakov, a northern neighborhood of Jerusalem, where he founded Bais Medrash Nachliel, and where Kollel Nachmani was established in his memory.

He translated Rabbi Eliyahu Kitov&#x27;s Hebrew books &quot;The Book of Our Heritage&quot;, &quot;Jew and His Home&quot; and &quot;Rite and Reason&quot; to English. His name was often written as Nathan Bulman in English.

<text>The Battle of Trocadero, fought on 31 August 1823, was a significant battle in France&#x27;s expedition in support of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII. The French defeated the Spanish liberal forces and restored Ferdinand to absolute rule.

==Prelude==
After the downfall of Napoleon, King Ferdinand VII of Spain refused to adopt the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 and in 1820 faced a rebellion in favour of a constitutional monarchy, led by Rafael del Riego y Nuñez.
The King was captured and detained at Cádiz, the seat of the Spanish parliament, the Cortes. Alarmed by these events, the other European powers convened in October 1822 at the Congress of Verona and authorized France to intervene in the conflict and restore the rule of Ferdinand, with only Britain abstaining from that decision.

==Military intervention==

On 17 April 1823, French forces led by Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, son of the future Charles X, crossed the Pyrenees into Spain.

The French forces were welcomed by the Basques and conservative Spaniards. The duke dispatched a force to besiege San Sebastián while he launched an attack on Madrid, held by the rebel government, which on 23 May withdrew to Seville. Madrid&#x27;s military commander secretly surrendered and fled to France, and the leaderless Madrid garrison could not keep out the French, who seized the city and installed a regent, pending Ferdinand&#x27;s expected return.

The French moved south to deal with the rebels at Cádiz, and besieged the fort of Trocadero, which controlled access to the city. On 31 August 1823 they launched a surprise bayonet attack from the sea side, taking advantage of the low tide, and took the fort. After this action, French infantry captured the Trocadero village by a flank attack. After this last action, 1700 Spanish soldiers were captured by the French.

Cádiz itself held out for three weeks despite bombardments, but was forced to surrender on 23 September 1823 and King Ferdinand was released and handed over to the French. Despite a prior promise of amnesty, the king ordered reprisals against the rebels; in the following years, an estimated 30,000 people were executed and 20,000 imprisoned.

== Aftermath ==

The Battle of Trocadero was one of the events that prompted U.S. President James Monroe to proclaim what would become known as the Monroe Doctrine on 2 December 1823, to safeguard the Americas against intervention by European powers.

The fall of Trocadero was commemorated in Paris, with the Trocadéro, where the city was expanding to the edges of the Bois de Boulogne. Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, the victor of the battle, was offered the title &quot;Prince of Trocadero&quot; by the Spanish king, but he refused to accept it, partly in disgust at Ferdinand going back on his promises of clemency.

In &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, Victor Hugo devoted several paragraphs to the battle (Volume II, Book 2, chapter 3), in which he called the battle &quot;a fine military action&quot;, but also said that &quot;[t]he war of 1823 was an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, (..) at the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution.&quot;

<doc id="970305" wikidata="Q855485" url="?curid=970305" title="Stenodus leucichthys">
<text>Stenodus leucichthys, also known as the inconnu, sheefish, &quot;ak balyk&quot;, or &quot;beloribitsa&quot;, is a species of large, anadromous, freshwater whitefish in the family Salmonidae. In the strict sense its natural distribution is restricted to the Caspian Sea basin. It is now considered extinct in the wild, but survives in cultured stocks. The nelma (&quot;Stenodus nelma&quot;), a more widespread species of Eurasia and North America, is sometimes considered its subspecies.

== Systematics ==
Alternatively, the name &quot;Stenodus leucichtys&quot; has previously been used in a broader sense, referring to a widespread species composed of two subspecies, which if true would make it the sole extant representative of the &quot;Stenodus&quot; genus. In addition to the landlocked subspecies &quot;Stenodus leucichthys leucichthys&quot;, it comprises the nelma, &quot;Stenodus leucichthys nelma&quot; (Pallas, 1773) which lives in Eurasian and North American rivers of the Arctic basin. Despite this designation, nelma, similarly known as the sheefish or inconnu, is currently often considered to be a distinct species &quot;Stenodus nelma&quot;, which makes the legitimacy of this use case and its inclusion of both species as one debatable.

At a higher level, the genus &quot;Stenodus&quot; is not considered phylogenetically distinct from the broader lake whitefish genus &quot;Coregonus&quot;, although it is phenotypically distinct due to its large size and specialized predator morphology. This is due to conflicting evidence regarding the monophyly of the &quot;Coregonus&quot; genus and its relationship to &quot;Stenodus&quot;, either being sister to or nested within &quot;Coregonus&quot;, with several studies backing both arguments. Possible reasons for conflicting results include the relatively new age of the clade that contains both genera, which diverged approximately 10 million years ago, and the lack of sufficient data on the effect of hybridization between and within each genera. While the most recent mitogenomic analysis does support the monophyly of &quot;Coregonus&quot;, evidence of the Atlantic whitefish species, &quot;C. huntsmani&quot;, being more basal to the whitefish genus than the &quot;Stenodus&quot; genus suggests it being paraphyletic.

== Description ==
The inconnu has a large, terminal mouth with a protruding lower jaw, a high and pointed dorsal fin, a forked and homocercal tail, and possesses an adipose fin. It is generally silvery white on the body sides and underbelly with a green, blue, or pale brown back. The meat is white, flaky, sweet, and somewhat oily. It has an elongate, fusiform body plan of up to in total length and weighing up to . Males exhibit slight sexual dimorphism during spawning, developing nuptial tubercles on its head and body side. Additionally, Stenodus leucichthys, and the closely related nelma, are distinct among whitefish due to their more predatory morphologies. In addition to being extremely closely related species, S. leucichthys and S. nelma are also largely indistinguishable in appearance, however, the two species should not be confused given their ranges occupy different continents.

== Biology ==
&quot;Stenodus leucichthys&quot; is an anadromous fish, meaning it migrates up stream into fresh waters from the sea in order to spawn and reproduce externally. Egg development can last up to 200 days, culminating in the release of over 100 thousand eggs, with each individual spawning twice during their life cycle (every 2 to 3 years). Migrations can last up to or exceeding a year long, this is partially owing to the slow development of their gonads which can require up to 8 months spent in the river to fully mature, just in time for their spawning season. In terms of development, inconnu larvae reach the fingerling stage at approximately 30 to 40 days and have a maturation period lasting 3 to 6 years, with males typically reaching maturity about one year earlier. Although historically calculated based on their scales, age is most accurately measured by analyzing the otolith or fin rays, particularly pectoral fin rays, of &quot;Stenodus&quot; as crowding of scales in old age fish reduces the accuracy and readability of these measurements. However, the accuracy of these measurements has only been analyzed in the North American populations of the closely related, or possible subspecies, &quot;Stenodus nelma&quot;. 

The fish eat plankton and aquatic insect larvae as juveniles and then become predators of smaller fish almost exclusively in adulthood. However, 30-day old fingerlings stomach contents have been observed to contain the larvae and juveniles of smaller fish species, indicating that this predatory transition occurs during very early life stages. As an adult, its primary food source, comprising over 90% of its diet, is small pelagic fish which mainly consisted of native kilka and silverside, with less reliance on Caspian roach and gobiids, prior to its extirpation.

== Distribution ==
Endemic to the Caspian Sea, the Caspian inconnu is now considered extinct in the wild, with current populations confined to hatcheries or only maintained due to stocking. Within the Caspian, inconnus live primarily in the central and southern parts of the sea during summer months but are also often found in the Northern Caspian for feeding during autumn and winter months. 

Historically, &quot;ak balyk&quot; used to inhabit particularly the Volga, Ural and Terek rivers, and migrate up to upstream from the Caspian to their main spawning grounds Kama River until dam construction and river contamination limited migration past the city of Volgograd. In addition to the Kama tributary, their major spawning grounds included the Oka and Sura tributaries among others along the greater Volga River. Alternatively, the closely related nelma has a broad, arctic and sub-arctic distribution extending from northern Eurasia to north-west North America.

== Habitat ==
Inconnus are pelagic fish that do not exceed depths of , typically inhabiting depths. It is euryhaline given its anadromous spawning migration, allowing them to survive in fresh and brackish waters with increased salinity tolerances developing in fingerlings around the age of 30 to 50 days. A primarily cold-water species, inconnu prefer temperatures below 20°C and will only be found in the North Caspian when temperatures reach around 10°C.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyAlczSm164.

== Conservation Status ==
Following the construction of dams and hydropower reservoirs, particularly the Volgograd dam in 1959, the migration and natural reproduction of this species has been completely impeded with no efforts to reestablish their natural migration routes. Historically, their food supply was sustained by native small fish until the introduction of invasive comb jelly Mnemiopsis into the Caspian and the decline of prey fish stocks, especially kilka, degraded their food supplies, which contributed to its decline as well. Today, the taxon is considered to be extinct in the wild by the IUCN Red List. The stock however survives in hatcheries, particularly those established in the Volga River, and some populations are maintained by stocking.

== Human Use ==
In the past, inconnu was a very important commercial fish, with its fat-rich meat making it ideal for smoking. Smoked whitefish is typically referred to as &quot;balyk&quot; in the Turkic-speaking areas of this region and is likely the origin for the species’ Kazakh name, &quot;ak balyk&quot;. While annual commercial catch rates used to exceed 1000 tons in the early to mid-20th century, the rapidly declining population has led to a ban on commercial fishing of &quot;Stenodus leucichthys&quot;, with fishing only done for reproductive purposes in support of hatcheries and only at special fishing sites. While this ban was lifted in the 1980s due to artificial reproduction efforts, it was reestablished because of continued population decline from illegal fishing, river contamination, and hatcheries releasing fewer fingerlings. During this ban lift, the inconnu served as an important fish for restocking in the Caspian, however these efforts were largely reduced in the 1990s due to further population decline. The widespread, closely related &quot;Stenodus nelma&quot; is a historically important subsistence food for Native Alaskans in the Yukon and Mackenzie River basins.

<text>The Setantii (sometimes read as &quot;Segantii&quot;) were a possible pre-Roman British people who apparently lived in the western and southern littoral of Lancashire in England. It is thought likely they were a sept or sub-tribe of the Brigantes, who, at the time of the Roman invasion, dominated much of what is now northern England.

==Background==
The Setantii name is known from a single source only, the 2nd century &quot;Geographia of Ptolemy&quot;. Recorded there is the placename &quot;Portus Setantiorum&quot; (Port of the Setantii). Its precise location remains unknown although various suggestions have been made, including the possibility that it has since been lost to the sea. Some scholars argue that it may have been located in present-day Fleetwood. Also recorded by Ptolemy is the hydronym &quot;Seteia&quot;, assumed by its position in his text to refer to the River Mersey.

==Links to later Celtic legends==
Sir John Rhys linked the name of the Setantii with Seithenyn, a figure in Welsh mythology. Seithenyn was a prince with responsibilities over the sea defences of Cantre&#x27;r Gwaelod. Drunkenly neglecting his duties one night, the sea overran the kingdom, and it sank beneath Cardigan Bay. Rhys noted the similarities between Setantii, Seithenyn, the Irish Sétanta Beg, and the Breton legends surrounding &quot;Enez-Sizun&quot; and the Lost City of Ys.

Rhys posited that, although the name was Brythonic in origin, the soundings of the later legends left no doubt that &quot;we have in these names distant echoes of an inundation story, once widely current in both Britains (Great Britain and Brittany) and perhaps also in Ireland&quot;. Although he acknowledged he was unaware of any similar legend on the Lancashire coast (such as the inundation of Portus Setantiorum), Rhys linked all the later legends back to the Setantii of Lancashire.

&quot;Sétanta&quot;, the birth name of the Irish legendary figure Cú Chulainn, may also be linked to the Setantii.

<text>The Baldwin Peninsula (Iñupiaq: &quot;Qikiqtaġruk&quot;) is a peninsula located on the Arctic Circle in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Alaska, at . It extends into Kotzebue Sound from the Alaska mainland and defines the south boundary of Hotham Inlet. It is 2–19 km (1–12 miles) wide and named after Leonard D. Baldwin, a New York City attorney and investor who in conjunction with the Lomen brothers, introduced domesticated reindeer to Alaska, which Inuit in Alaska took part in.

The city of Kotzebue and Ralph Wien Memorial Airport are located at the end of the peninsula. The remainder of Baldwin Peninsula is covered with permafrost and hundreds of tundra lakes.

<doc id="970325" wikidata="Q6208724" url="?curid=970325" title="Joe Borowski (politician)">
<text>Joseph Paul Borowski (December 12, 1932 – September 23, 1996) was a Canadian politician and activist. From 1969 to 1971, he was a cabinet minister in Manitoba Premier Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democratic Party (NDP) government. Subsequently, he gained national fame for his opposition to abortion.

==Early life==
Borowski was born in Wishart, Saskatchewan, and was educated at Birchcreek School in that province. He subsequently moved to Sudbury, Ontario, and Thompson, Manitoba, to work as a miner and steelworker. Borowski was vice-president of the United Steelworkers of America Local 6166 in 1964–65, and helped to win municipal incorporation for Thompson at around the same time. He retired from manual labour in his 30s, and became the owner of a gift shop.

==Political career==
Borowski became a public figure in Manitoba during the late 1960s, when he camped outside the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in extremely cold weather on two separate occasions. His first such action, in 1965, was intended as a protest against the lack of free municipal elections in Thompson. The following year, he stayed outside the legislature for sixty-five days to protest the pay increases awarded to Premier Roblin and his cabinet. His presence was a nuisance to many in government, and cabinet minister Stewart McLean eventually had him ejected from the legislative grounds. He was later arrested on three separate occasions for refusing to collect the provincial sales tax in his store.

Borowski had not been directly involved in politics prior to this experience. He had supported John Diefenbaker&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives for a time at the federal level, but was not directly involved in partisan politics, and does not appear to have contemplated running for public office. He had become a local celebrity through his protest, however, and was drafted by the Manitoba NDP to campaign in a February 1969 by-election in the northern riding of Churchill. He won the party&#x27;s nomination over Archie Nabess, and defeated independent candidate Blain Johnston by sixteen votes (confirmed by a recount) in the general election. He returned to the legislature in March 1969, to join the NDP caucus on the opposition benches. Borowski endorsed Sidney Green for the party&#x27;s leadership in May 1969.

He was easily re-elected in the province&#x27;s general election of 1969 (held in June), defeating Progressive Conservative Thomas Farrell by almost a thousand votes in Thompson.

When the NDP formed a minority government following the 1969 election, Schreyer surprised many by appointing Borowski as his Minister of Transportation. Borowski represented northern interests in the cabinet, and was also seen as an important populist link between the NDP and working class voters. Russell Doern, who joined cabinet in 1970, later claimed that Borowski&#x27;s popularity rivalled that of the Premier during this period. On September 3, 1970, Borowski was given the additional position of Minister of Public Works.

There are conflicting views as to Borowski&#x27;s performance in cabinet. Some claim that he was a committed Public Works Minister, who often conducted personal inspections of road renewal projects and demanded efficient results. Others allege that he treated provincial bureaucrats with contempt, and ran his ministries in a highly centralized manner. Assessments of his job performance, however, were soon overshadowed by controversies unrelated to his ministerial duties.

On February 17, 1971, Borowski made derogatory comments about aboriginal Canadians, veterans and people with disabilities during an address to NDP supporters in Winnipeg. Former party leader Russell Paulley openly criticized his remarks, and Borowski was nearly dropped from cabinet before agreeing to a public apology.

Borowski was known for his social conservatism on subjects such as pornography and abortion, and frequently expressed his views on these subjects in public debate. He was dropped from cabinet on September 8, 1971, after making several intemperate remarks on the subject of abortion, which included mocking a group of protesters who had arrived on the legislative grounds to support abortion services. As a backbencher, he tried to prevent public funds from being spent on hospitals which provided out-of-province abortion referrals.

Borowski finally left the NDP caucus on June 25, 1972, arguing that the Schreyer government&#x27;s new film censorship board would not adequately prevent pornographic movies from entering the province. He initially sat as an &quot;independent New Democrat&quot;, and later left the NDP entirely.

In the provincial election of 1973, Borowski ran as an independent candidate in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Point Douglas, and lost to NDP incumbent Donald Malinowski by more than 2,500 votes. Borowski&#x27;s campaign was based almost entirely on an anti-abortion platform. He never ran for public office again after this loss. After briefly supporting Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s Liberal government in the mid-1970s, Borowski abandoned partisan politics entirely. In later years, he criticized all major parties as ineffective on issues such as abortion.

==Activism==
Shortly before the 1977 provincial election, Borowski placed a large advertisement in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; which purported to describe the views of several MLAs on the subject of abortion. Not all of his information was accurate. MLAs whom Borowski believed were supporters of abortion were listed as &quot;pro-death&quot;. Schreyer was described as ambivalent. Borowski was active in this period as the co-ordinator of Campaign Life in Manitoba and remained active with the group for the rest of his life.

In addition to his activities as an anti-abortion spokesman, Borowski also became an insurance salesman and a proponent of health foods in the late 1970s. In 1977, he published a work entitled &quot;The Borowski Cookbook&quot;. He withheld his income tax for five years in the 1970s, to show his opposition to Canada&#x27;s federal abortion policies.

In 1981, Borowski went on an eighty-day hunger strike to protest the absence of a provision for the unborn in Canada&#x27;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The public effect of this demonstration was blunted somewhat when it was pointed out that he had outlived contemporary IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands, who in 1981 had starved to death in Maze Prison after a hunger strike that lasted only 66 days.

Three years earlier, his lawyers had put forward a case arguing that abortion was illegal under Canada&#x27;s 1960 Bill of Rights, in that it robbed fetuses of their right to life. The case was not brought to trial until 1983, and was not completed for several years after that. The Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear Borowski&#x27;s case in 1989, on the grounds that it had become irrelevant when Canada&#x27;s abortion laws were struck down in 1988.

Borowski also published a series of works in the late 1980s that were criticized as homophobic. In 1988, he released a document that called for &quot;all known gays&quot; to be quarantined from the rest of society until the AIDS epidemic had subsided. He also published a work entitled &quot;Child Molestation and Homosexuality&quot;, the front page of which showed a middle-aged man attempting to lure a child for sexual purposes. Winnipeg AIDS activist and future mayor Glen Murray became a vocal opponent of Borowski during this period.

Borowski died of cancer in 1996. In August 2004, author Lianne Laurence published a biography entitled &quot;Borowski: A Canadian Paradox&quot;, funded largely by donations from the anti-abortion community in Canada.

<doc id="970340" wikidata="Q901654" url="?curid=970340" title="Everybody Loves a Happy Ending">
<text>Everybody Loves a Happy Ending is the sixth studio album by English pop rock band Tears for Fears, released on 14 September 2004 in the United States and on 7 March 2005 in the United Kingdom and Europe. 

The album marked Tears for Fears&#x27; comeback following a hiatus in the late 1990s, as well as the return of founding member Curt Smith. However, it performed modestly on the UK and US music charts compared to the band&#x27;s previous records. The band focused primarily on touring in the years following &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot;″s release, with a follow-up album not being completed until nearly eighteen years later.

==Release==
Work on the album began in 2000, after Orzabal and Smith ended their longstanding feud. The album was originally due for release on the Arista label, but personnel changes in the label&#x27;s management (namely the departure of L.A. Reid who had signed the duo) led to the band breaking ties with the label before any music was commercially released, with the record company only pressing up a number of red vinyl promos. As Orzabal and Smith own the copyright, they left Arista without having to re-record the album and struck up a number of deals to release the record with various independent/heritage record labels around the world. The album eventually surfaced in the US in 2004 when it was released on the New Door label (a subsidiary of Universal Music), and in the UK in 2005 on the British independent label Gut Records. In 2020, after Orzabal and Smith signed with Irving and Jeff Azoff&#x27;s Full Stop management company the record appeared on various streaming services worldwide.

According to SoundScan figures, the album had sold 99,000 copies in the US by January 2008.

==Reception==
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot; has an average score of 65 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

James Christopher Monger of AllMusic gave a positive review, giving the album four stars, observing. &quot;&quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending&quot; will do little to convert those who winced at Orzabal and Smith&#x27;s obtuse lyrics and over the top production the first time around, but loyal followers, fans of XTC&#x27;s &quot;Apple Venus, Pt. 1&quot;, and lovers of intricately arranged and artfully executed pop music will find themselves delightfully consumed by another chapter from this enigmatic group.&quot;

==Track listing==


Notes
*&quot;Size of Sorrow&quot; was written by Roland Orzabal in the 1990s and was first performed live during Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;Elemental&quot; tour in 1993, as one of several new and unreleased songs at that time. This earlier version featured slightly different lyrics and the lead vocal was performed by vocalist/bass player Gail Ann Dorsey who was working and touring with the band at the time after the departure of Curt Smith. The studio version, as heard on this album, was sung by Smith.
*&quot;Who You Are&quot; is the first original song released by Tears For Fears to not credit Orzabal as a writer. A different version of the song appears on Curt Smith&#x27;s solo album &quot;Halfway, Pleased&quot;, released in 2007.
*&quot;Ladybird&quot; quotes the English nursery rhyme &quot;Ladybird Ladybird&quot; in its chorus. It was the first collaboration between Smith and Orzabal since the split. Smith had presented the chorus to Orzabal, who wrote a verse to it. The first song written entirely together for the album was &quot;Closest Thing to Heaven&quot;.

<doc id="970356" wikidata="Q5526812" url="?curid=970356" title="Gastrobot">
<text>Gastrobot, meaning literally &#x27;stomach robot&#x27;, was a term coined in 1998 by the University of South Florida professor, Dr. Stuart Wilkinson, who stated that a gastrobot is &quot;...an intelligent machine (robot) that derives all its energy requirements from the digestion of real food.&quot; The gastrobot&#x27;s energy intake may come in the form of carbohydrates, lipids etc., or may be a simpler source, such as alcohol.

This type of robot ingests food and passes it into a microbial fuel cell (MFC), which converts the food into gases and other potential energy. The gases and liquids help fuel things such as a hydrogen fuel cell, which helps create more energy, and generates other gases that help power the gastrobot&#x27;s mechanics.

== Application ==
Gastrobotics could allow users to deploy self-sustaining robots for extended times without human supervision. Common robots of today—powered by solar panels, batteries, or other energy sources—tend to become unreliable without human supervision for battery replacement, etc. Other robots must plug in to recharge, so they require constant access to an electrical outlet, which limits range. Solar powered robots are more independent but need a large surface area of solar panels to be efficient. This adds bulk and depends on weather conditions and clean panels to remain efficient. Gastrobotics might be able to live entirely off available natural resources. The main goal of this new technology is to produce robots that can go on missions where human supervision is not feasible or desirable.

Some examples include 
* Automatic lawn mower powered by grass clippings.
* Fruit picking or soil testing robot powered by fallen leaves or fruit
* Exploration robots that are powered by their own environment 
* Sea exploration: seaweed and algae 
* Forest exploration: grass, fruits and vegetables
* Military applications: powered by enemy

== Technology ==
Gastrobotics energy sources mainly focuses on the use of a microbial fuel cell. Microbial fuel cells require an oxidation reduction reaction to generate electricity. A microbial fuel cell uses bacteria, which must be fed. The fuel cell typically contains two compartments, the anode and cathode terminals which are separated by an ion-exchange membrane.

First, in the anode chamber, the bacteria remove electrons from the organic material and pass the electrons to a carbon electrode. The electrons then move through the ion-exchange membrane to the cathode chamber, where they combine with protons and oxygen to form water. The electrons flowing from the anode into the cathode terminals generate electrical current and voltage. From this point, research is exploring using a hydrogen fuel cell to amplify the energy from the microbial fuel cell. The hydrogen fuel cell would use microbial fuel cell byproducts to create more energy without having to consume more material. Gastrobot requirements include: 
* Harvesting: Must be able to gather food from real world settings and include some sort of arm or other mechanism that grabs food for consumption. 
* Mastication: It needs some type of mouth to &quot;chew&quot; or break down food into smaller pieces for the system. 
* Ingestion: An &quot;esophagus&quot; must move food from the &quot;mouth&quot; to the microbial fuel cell. 
* Digestion: The microbial fuel cell &quot;stomach&quot; must produce energy. 
* Defecation: The gastrobot must remove waste to avoid it building up.

=== Fuel ===
The best fuel source for a gastrobot is anything high in carbohydrates. Vegetables, fruit, grains, insects, and foliage are good candidates. However, it can also consume organic waste products such as urine, anaerobic sludge (biodegradable waste and sewage), and landfill leachate. Meat can be a fuel, but contains too much fat to be efficient.

== Benefits ==
The future of gastrobotics has many potential benefits to society.
* Robot independence: A successful gastrobot would not require human supervision to carry out tasks. Independence could improve efficiency by freeing humans to work on other tasks.
* Eco-friendly fuel source: The gastrobot, by breaking down food, potentially runs on a completely green fuel source. After the food breaks down into energy, what is left is and (water and oxygen). This type of energy source might let robots function without adding to pollution.

== Challenges ==
The gastrobot is in its early development stages, and so faces many challenges:
* Efficiency: The current prototype is inefficient. It takes about 18 hours of &quot;carbo-loading&quot; for about 15 minutes of movement. This is useless in any real world application.
* Foraging: Development must make the gastrobot able to locate, identify, and acquire food.
* Intelligence: Gastrobots require more processing power and sophisticated software to function efficiently in many real world applications. They must be able to locate, identify and acquire food with potential for consumption. They must also be able to identify and adapt to new environments while following instructions for their mission.
* Maneuverability: The current prototype has very little maneuverability. For the robot to move around, it must also be able to grab, harvest, and move potential fuel sources. Furthermore, the robot must regulate the amount of food it eats at a time—like an electronic appetite. If the robot consumes too much organic material it may overload and clog. Furthermore, it must know when to search for food.

As robots become more independent they must be more compliant. If a robot is out on a &quot;mission&quot; it must be sensitive to others around it instead of having a &quot;complete task at all costs&quot; mentality.

<doc id="970369" wikidata="Q1932662" url="?curid=970369" title="Futures (album)">
<text>Futures is the fifth studio album by American rock band Jimmy Eat World, released on October 19, 2004, through Interscope Records. After touring in support of &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001) for two years, the band returned home and began working on new material by mid-2003. Following fruitless sessions with producer Mark Trombino, the band re-grouped and recorded with Gil Norton. The sessions lasted from February to May 2004 and were held at various studios in California and Arizona. Described as encompassing several rock styles, &quot;Futures&quot; included more solos and complex guitar parts than past releases, intended to expand on the atmosphere of their third studio album &quot;Clarity&quot; (1999). The songs on the album were compared to the work of Jets to Brazil and Maritime, while some of the guitar parts echoed the sound of Fugazi and Hüsker Dü.

&quot;Futures&quot; was met with favorable reaction from music critics, many of whom found it an enjoyable listen and praised the songwriting. It charted at number 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 after selling 98,000 copies in its first week. It would go on to sell over 615,000 copies, and was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;Pain&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in August 2004. &quot;Futures&quot; was promoted with headlining tours of the US, Europe, and Japan, before the band toured with Green Day in the US, the UK, and Australia. Jimmy Eat World followed the album with two further singles, &quot;Work&quot; in December 2004 and &quot;Futures&quot; in May 2005. Some publications, such as &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; included the album on their list of the year&#x27;s best releases. &quot;Pain&quot; was later certified gold by the RIAA and peaked at number 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Work&quot; and &quot;Futures&quot; both reached the top 30 of the radio-only Alternative Airplay chart, with the former peaking higher at number six.

==Background and development==
In July 2001, Jimmy Eat World released their fourth studio album, &quot;Bleed American&quot;, through major label DreamWorks Records. It became a commercial success, selling over 1.3 million copies, being certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Two of its singles charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, namely, &quot;Sweetness&quot; at number 75 and &quot;The Middle&quot; at number five. Due to the album&#x27;s popularity, the band promoted it with two years of touring, which made it hard for the members to unwind after returning home. In May 2003, vocalist and lead guitarist Jim Adkins said that the band had a lot of new material and would record sometime thereafter with Mark Trombino in Los Angeles, California. Trombino worked with the band previously, having produced &quot;Static Prevails&quot; (1996), &quot;Clarity&quot; (1999), and &quot;Bleed American&quot;.

Jimmy Eat World began pre-production in mid-July with Trombino, where they worked on 18 songs. Recording began in early August, with the aim of working on 14 songs. By September 2003, after five weeks, recording sessions were nearly finished. The group reached a breaking point with Trombino as they ran out of song ideas; their disagreements led to Trombino&#x27;s departure from the project, with Adkins saying, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to work with people who aren&#x27;t extremely passionate about their ideas and their contributions.&quot; The band subsequently took a break and performed a few shows. &quot;Believe in What You&quot;, a stop-gap video/live-album, was released in October. The following month, the band&#x27;s label, DreamWorks, was bought by Universal Music Group and absorbed into Interscope Records in January 2004.

==Production==
Jimmy Eat World regrouped sometime after and wrote &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Polaris&quot;, and &quot;23&quot;. The band had been working with Trombino for around 10 years and wanted to see what ideas another producer would suggest. Bassist Rick Burch said they felt it was too soon to work on an album, having spent a considerable amount of time touring &quot;Bleed American&quot;, suggesting that they should have taken a six month break. The members had liked albums by the different acts that producer Gil Norton had previously produced, such as the Pixies, The Distillers, and Dashboard Confessional. Lind said that while Trombino was able to handle recording, mix and be a producer, Norton preferred to focus his efforts on the production. He added that Norton&#x27;s long career producing aided the band&#x27;s direction. Norton spent two days at the band&#x27;s own studio, where they showed him demos they had done. Norton enjoyed the demos and was enlisted by the band to produce their next album. Pre-production started and lasted for a month before recording sessions began in February 2004 at Cello Studios in Los Angeles.

When they entered the studio, they had accumulated about 30 tracks to work with; Norton and engineer David Schiffman were assisted by Jason Grossman and Steven Rhodes. The drum parts and a few basic tracks were completed over the course of three weeks. Drummer Zach Lind said he fell into the habit of doing simple drum patterns during the making of &quot;Clarity&quot; and &quot;Bleed American&quot;, but Norton pushed Lind to challenge himself. Sessions then moved to the home studio of Harvey Moltz, a friend of the band, in Tucson, Arizona, where most of the album was recorded. Adkins said the group simply wanted a change of scenery from California, as Tucson helped them work without distractions; guitars and vocals were done there. During the course of the sessions, the band recorded up to 9 or 10 versions of each track.

Additional recording was done by the band at Tempe Studio in Tempe, Arizona, where they recorded vocals. Strings were recorded at Oceanway Studios in Los Angeles with Jake Davies, who was assisted by Greg Burns. Rich Costey and Davies acted as additional engineers; the latter also did digital editing. While recording strings for &quot;Drugs or Me&quot;, there were 30 minutes remaining for the session. Davies transcribed a synthesizer placeholder part for &quot;23&quot; into string notation and had the musicians record it with the time left over. Sessions were concluded in May 2004, with mixing taking place from mid-June over the course of a month, with Costey at Cello Studios. He was assisted in this process by Claudius Mittendorfer with secondary engineer Dan Leffler. Costey mixed &quot;Drugs or Me&quot; at Avatar Studios in New York City with secondary engineer Ross Petersen. Ted Jensen then mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City.

==Composition==

===Overview===
Musically, &quot;Futures&quot; has been described as alternative rock, arena rock, emo, pop-punk, pop rock, and power pop. The album saw the band shy away from the pop-influenced sound of &quot;Bleed American&quot; and expand on the mood of &quot;Clarity&quot;. The band incorporated more guitar solos, which rhythm guitarist Tom Linton had been insisting on, and complex guitar lines. Adkins viewed the release as a sequel to &quot;Clarity&quot;, with which &quot;Futures&quot; shared greater musical density. When working on material, Adkins would show the band a rough outline of it, which the rest of the members would flesh out and potentially add further instrumentation, such as piano. Discussing the title, Adkins said it could be perceived in different ways: &quot;It&#x27;s pessimistic, it&#x27;s optimistic, and hopeful, and greedy all at the same time.&quot;

Lind compared its darker sound to the middle portion of &quot;Clarity&quot; and said the album&#x27;s second half was more atmospheric than their previous work. Some of the material on the album dated back to when the band was recording &quot;Bleed American&quot;, while other material had existed for only two weeks prior to the band entering the studio for &quot;Futures&quot;. Linton said producer Norton provided a number of &quot;really good&quot; song ideas in regards to the sound and final arrangements. Norton helped the band think about transitions between sections in songs; previously Adkins felt &quot;the best transition was none... I always thought it was more powerful not to do one.&quot; The album drew comparisons to the bands Jets to Brazil and Maritime, while some of the guitar lines recalled Hüsker Dü and Fugazi. The lyrics delve into darker subject matter, such as despair, politics, drug abuse, and self-loathing. Adkins said several tracks were influenced by the presidency of George W. Bush; he said he was &quot;reacting to the political climate of that period&quot;.

===Tracks===
The opening song, &quot;Futures&quot;, was a mid-tempo track that was compared to other acts Norton had worked with, such as Foo Fighters and the Pixies. The song starts with two harmonizing guitar riffs, shifting into verses that put the vocals at the forefront. A tremolo-affected guitar line in the pre-chorus leads into the half-time chorus section, complete with echo-enhanced vocals. In an earlier iteration of the song, the bridge section was a wall of loud guitars, instead of the final version where it shifts to acoustic guitars and a Rhodes piano. Adkins said the track was about Bush as well as disillusionment. One of lines from the song&#x27;s chorus – &quot;Trade up for the fast ride&quot; – is taken verbatim from &quot;In the Same Room&quot;, a track from &quot;Static Prevails&quot;. &quot;Just Tonight...&quot; was in the vein of &quot;Run to You&quot; by Bryan Adams, and recalled the group&#x27;s &quot;Static Prevails&quot; material. &quot;Just Tonight...&quot; was one of the earliest songs written for the album, and ended up receiving constant minor changes during the writing process. The track was originally called &quot;Sex You Up&quot;; Lind said its final name &quot;Just Tonight...&quot; was a reference to Color Me Badd.

&quot;Work&quot; is a pop-rock track with vocal harmonies that recalled &quot;The Middle&quot;. Liz Phair contributed backing vocals to it; the group felt it would be a song she should sing. The band&#x27;s A&amp;R representative personally knew Phair, and eventually got in contact with her. Adkins, who wrote the song while having Phair&#x27;s &quot;Divorce Song&quot; (1993) in mind, said the track was simply about &quot;doing something you know you shouldn&#x27;t be doing&quot;. &quot;Kill&quot; opens with a piano and acoustic guitar intro, which builds to crescendos in the vein of the Pixies. Burch&#x27;s bassline plays a counter-melody to the acoustic guitar; strings are barely audible during the bridge section. Adkins set himself a challenge to write a track that had no repetitive lyrics, which became &quot;Kill&quot;; it features a reference to the Heatmiser song &quot;Half Right&quot;. Lind had discovered a piece of music that became &quot;Kill&quot; partway through writing when looking through their ideas on a computer. It was had scratch vocals from Adkins and a 30-second acoustic guitar part. Lind was impressed that out of all the ideas they had, this section had fallen by the wayside. He showed the clip to Adkins, when the pair quickly expanded it into a full song.

&quot;The World You Love&quot; was initially titled &quot;Suicide&quot; and went through many versions before the band landed at the final one. The AC/DC-indebted track, &quot;Pain&quot;, discusses the pros and cons of self-medicating through the use of alcohol and drugs. It was the last track written for the album, done just before they entered the studio. Adkins came up with the lyrics while walking around the University of Arizona campus. &quot;Drugs or Me&quot; is a piano-and-feedback-led ballad about Adkins&#x27;s friend choosing him or drugs. It features strings that were arranged by David Campbell and was compared to the work of Death Cab for Cutie. An earlier version included an acoustic guitar playing eighth notes, which the rest of the song was then based upon. They later re-made it, building the song around Adkins&#x27; vocals and swapping the acoustic eighth notes for arpeggiated guitar and piano parts.

&quot;Polaris&quot; was done in the vein of U2; the guitar part was a mix of &quot;Frontwards&quot; by Pavement and &quot;Hysteria&quot; by Def Leppard. Norton persuaded the band to end the song with another chorus breakdown instead of concluding early as they intended. The following track, &quot;Nothingwrong&quot;, was the most reminiscent of &quot;Bleed American&quot;, specifically the track &quot;Get It Faster&quot;. The power ballad &quot;Night Drive&quot; opens with an &quot;ooh&quot; vocal melody; it talks about an alcoholic person in Adkins&#x27;s life. Adkins said with the track, the listener &quot;get[s] the feeling of a verse, chorus and bridge&quot;, despite only one chord progression being present throughout it. The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;23&quot;, recalled the 1989 album &quot;Disintegration&quot; by The Cure. It starts with a bass part and echo-affected acoustic guitars, before the drums and Adkins&#x27;s vocal part accompany them. Adkins said it is about discovery and taking chances on opportunities that arise. The song was an attempt to match both the atmospheric material on &quot;Clarity&quot; and the intentionally simplistic songs found on &quot;Bleed American&quot;.

==Release==
On July 15, 2004, &quot;Futures&quot; was announced for release in three months&#x27; time; alongside this, the band emailed three songs, namely &quot;Pain&quot;, &quot;Just Tonight...&quot; and &quot;Polaris&quot;, to their street team. On July 30, the album&#x27;s track listing was revealed. Samples of three new tracks—&quot;Futures&quot;, &quot;Nothingwrong&quot;, and &quot;Night Drive&quot;—were posted on the group&#x27;s website shortly afterwards. &quot;Pain&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on August 24, 2004. Two versions of the CD single were released: one included demos of &quot;When I Want&quot; and &quot;Shame&quot; and the music video for &quot;Pain&quot;; while the other featured the demo &quot;Shame&quot;, a live recording of &quot;Yer Feet&quot;, and the video for &quot;Pain&quot;. The video, which premiered on September 14 through Launch.com, was directed by Paul Fedor and roughly followed the theme of the 1985 film &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;. It was shot in North Bridge, California.

On October 11, &quot;Futures&quot; was made available for streaming through MTV&#x27;s website before being released on October 19 through Interscope Records. The artwork was a photograph taken by Christopher Wray-McCann at Burning Man. According to Adkins, the event had a phonebooth &quot;in the middle of nowhere with a sign above it that says &#x27;Talk to God. Bonus tracks were added to various versions: &quot;Shame&quot; on the vinyl and European CD versions; &quot;Shame&quot;, &quot;When I Want&quot;, and &quot;You&quot; on the Japanese edition. Some promotional copies featured the extra track &quot;Jen&quot;, which was left off the album, as Adkins felt it was out of place. A deluxe edition of the album was released showcasing the album&#x27;s songs in demo form. The UK deluxe edition included &quot;Shame&quot; and &quot;When I Want&quot;, and demo versions of both of them, as bonus tracks, while the Japanese version featured &quot;Shame&quot;, &quot;When I Want&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, demos of these three tracks, alongside &quot;Sparkle&quot;, an acoustic version of &quot;Work&quot;, and a cover of &quot;The Concept&quot; by Teenage Fanclub. The cover was also featured on the 7&quot; vinyl version of the single &quot;Work&quot;.

&quot;Work&quot; was released to radio on December 7, 2004. To coincide with the UK stint of a European tour, &quot;Work&quot; was released as a single there in March 2005. The CD single included the glitch musician Styrofoam&#x27;s remix of &quot;Drugs or Me&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Work&quot;, as well as the song&#x27;s music video. &quot;Futures&quot; was released to radio on May 10, 2005. In 2013, an &quot;iTunes Sessions&quot; EP was released, which featured a rendition of &quot;Kill&quot;. In 2014, the band went on a celebratory 10th anniversary tour for the album, where they played it live in its entirety, touring the US, Australia, and New Zealand. To coincide with this, &quot;Futures&quot;, alongside &quot;Static Prevails&quot; and &quot;Clarity&quot;, was re-pressed on vinyl. In 2021, the band performed the album in its entirety again, alongside 2019&#x27;s &quot;Surviving&quot; and 1999&#x27;s &quot;Clarity&quot;.

==Touring==
In late August and early September 2004, the band performed at the Street Scene and Summerfest festivals. Later in September, the group played two shows in the UK. To promote its release, the band played in-store gigs, held listening parties at Fast Forward chain stores, and a session for Launch.com. They appeared on &quot;Daily Download&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. In October and November, they embarked on a US tour with the likes of Recover, Emanuel, and Razorlight. Throughout December, the band played a series of radio festivals. In January 2005, they went on a brief, two-week US tour with Elefant and Reuben&#x27;s Accomplice.

In February and March 2005, the group went on a European tour, which ended with a stint in the UK. At the end of March, the band performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. A short series of shows in Japan led into a two-month US arena tour, co-headlining with Taking Back Sunday in April and May. Some shows featured supporting acts the Format and Mates of State. Jimmy Eat World supported Green Day for two shows in the UK in June, which was followed by a European tour in June and July. In late August, the group performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. Following this, between late August and October, the band had a supporting slot on Green Day&#x27;s three-month US arena tour. In December, the group again supported Green Day, for two shows in Australia.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Futures&quot; was well received by music critics upon its release. On the review aggregating website Metacritic, the album obtained an average score of 73, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Sputnikmusic staff member Adam Knott wrote that each second of the album &quot;is direct in its accessible, spirited approach and brilliantly executed.&quot; Its &quot;[g]ut-wrenching guitar lines, rhythmic releases and poignant songwriting are not even consistent; they&#x27;re constant.&quot; In a review for Punknews.org, Scott Heisel said the tracks &quot;toe the ever-so-thin line between commercial success and artistic integrity&quot;, thanks in part to Norton. &quot;E! Online&quot; found in the album a return to the group&#x27;s early beginnings, &quot;sporting 11 sparkling gems that carefully balance balladry ... with bombast&quot;. Bram Teitelman of &quot;Billboard&quot; said it contained the &quot;same trademarks that made [&quot;Bleed American&quot;] so enjoyable ... upbeat pop-punk, tempered with moodier, slower songs, great melodies and vocal harmonies&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Brian Hiatt opined that &quot;if Jimmy are in the middle of a long ride, Futures retains just enough tunefulness to keep us from jumping out of the car.&quot;

At &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Betty Clarke noted that the record was &quot;the ultimate pop-rock break-up album&quot;, with Adkins &quot;jump[ing] neck-deep into heartbreak. His lyrics are his strength.&quot; Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the band to be &quot;rid[ing] their bighearted radio rock into O.C.-worthy teen turmoil on &quot;Futures&quot;, their fifth and finest album.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; Gareth Dobson said the album would not &quot;break the mould, it&#x27;s not too radical, but then, JEW never were.&quot; It was &quot;an inviting, maturing album that still shows enough vitality to still be classed as a good rock album.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Tim Sendra stated &quot;Futures will most likely not be the sensation that Bleed American was – it is too dark and inwardly focused for that.&quot; Sendra, however, noted that the album shows a sound progression that fans should accept. &quot;IGN&quot; writer Todd Gilchrist criticized it as &quot;music for adults trying to be kids, and, well, I&#x27;m an adult.&quot; He added that it was not &quot;a bad album, but merely an unspecial one&quot;.

===Commercial performance and accolades===
&quot;Futures&quot; sold 98,000 copies in its first week, charting at number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Prior to the release of &quot;Chase This Light&quot; (2007), &quot;Futures&quot; had sold over 615,000 copies. &quot;Futures&quot; was certified gold in the US by the RIAA in March 2005, which was followed by gold certification of &quot;Pain&quot; two months later. Outside the US, &quot;Futures&quot; reached number seven in Canada, number 22 in the UK, number 23 in Scotland, number 27 in Australia, number 33 in Germany, and number 65 in Switzerland. The album was certified gold in Canada, and silver in the UK.

&quot;Pain&quot; charted at number one on Alternative Airplay, number 27 on Digital Song Sales, and number 93 on the Hot 100. &quot;Work&quot; charted at number six on Alternative Airplay, and number ten on Bubbling Under Hot 100. &quot;Futures&quot; charted at number 27 on Alternative Airplay.

&quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spartanburg Herald-Journal&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; included the album on their best-of-2004 album lists. It was ranked at number 44 in &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s &quot;50 Albums You Need to Hear Before You Die&quot; list. Mayday Parade drummer Jake Bundrick cited the album as an inspiration, while Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low has expressed admiration for it. Three of the album&#x27;s songs, namely, &quot;Just Tonight...&quot;, &quot;Work&quot;, and &quot;Nothingwrong&quot;, were covered by Australian acts for the tribute album &quot;Sing It Back: A Tribute to Jimmy Eat World&quot; (2015).

<doc id="970374" wikidata="Q17009817" url="?curid=970374" title="Eating utensil etiquette">
<text>Various customary etiquette practices exist regarding the placement and use of eating utensils in social settings. These practices vary from culture to culture. Fork etiquette, for example, differs in Europe, the United States, and Southeast Asia, and continues to change. In East Asian cultures, a variety of etiquette practices govern the use of chopsticks.

==Fork etiquette==
When used in conjunction with a knife to cut and consume food in Western social settings, two forms of fork etiquette are common. In the &quot;European style&quot;, which is not uniform across Europe, the diner keeps the fork in the left hand, in the &quot;American style&quot;, the fork is shifted between the left and right hands. Prior to the adoption of the fork, the custom in Europe was for all food to be conveyed to the mouth by the right hand (using a spoon, a knife, or fingers). When the fork was adopted, it followed this rule; it was held in the left hand while cutting and then transferred to the right to eat. This custom was brought to America by British colonists and became the American style. Most of Europe adopted the more rapid style of leaving the fork in the left hand in relatively modern times.

The difference between the American and European styles has been used as plot point in fictional works, including the 1946 film &quot;O.S.S.&quot; and the 2014 series &quot;&quot;. In both works, using the wrong fork etiquette threatens to expose undercover agents.

===German style===
The German style, also called the continental or European style despite the fact that it is not uniform across Europe, is to hold the fork (with the tines pointing down) in the left hand and the knife in the right. Once a bite-sized piece of food has been cut, it is speared and conducted to the mouth by the left hand. For other items, such as potatoes, vegetables or rice, the blade of the knife is used to assist or guide placement of the food on the back of the fork. The knife and fork are both held with the handle running along the palm and extending out to be held by thumb and forefinger. This style is sometimes called &quot;hidden handle&quot; because the palm conceals the handle.

===French and British style===
The French table setting involves placing the fork tines pointing down on the table on the left hand side of the plate. This was done to show the coat of arms that was traditionally on that side contrary to Germany or the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the fork tines face upward while sitting on the table.

The knife should be in the right hand and the fork in the left. However, if a knife is not needed – such as when eating pasta – the fork can be held in the right hand. Bread is always served and can be placed on the table cloth itself. It is considered unacceptable to use one&#x27;s fingers to taste the food. To taste a sauce before serving oneself, however, it is permissible to place a small piece of bread at the end of the fork for dipping.

===American style===
In the American style, also called the &quot;zig-zag method&quot; or &quot;fork switching&quot;, the knife is initially held in the right hand and the fork in the left. Holding food in place with the fork tines-down, a single bite-sized piece is cut with the knife. The knife is then set down on the plate, the fork transferred from the left hand to the right hand, and the food is brought to the mouth for consumption. The fork is then transferred back to the left hand and the knife is picked up with the right. In contrast to the European hidden handle grip, in the American style the fork is held much like a spoon or a pen once it is transferred to the right hand to convey food to the mouth.

One commentator has asserted that the American style of fork-handling is in decline, with the increased use of a hybrid of the traditional American and European styles. In this new style, the fork is not switched between hands between cutting and eating and may also be deployed &quot;tines-up&quot; as a scoop when convenient.

In defense of the traditional American style, Judith Martin wrote, &quot;Those who point out that the European manner is more efficient are right. Those who claim it is older or more sophisticated—etiquette has never considered getting food into the mouth faster a mark of refinement— are wrong.&quot;

===Southeast Asian style===
In the Southeast Asian style, the spoon is held in the right hand throughout consumption, except with certain dishes when a fork is more suitable. Rice and soups are a staple of the diet in Southeast Asian countries, so using a spoon is practical in such dishes. The spoon is used for manipulating food on the plate; knives are rarely used. Dishes are often cut into small portions before cooking, eliminating the need for a knife.

==Table setting==
Tables are often set with two or more forks, meant to be used for different courses; for example, a salad fork, a meat fork, and a dessert fork. Some institutions wishing to give an impression of high formality set places with many different forks for meals of several courses, although many etiquette authorities regard this as vulgar and prefer that the appropriate cutlery be brought in with each course.

In American dining etiquette, different placements are used when setting down the utensils to indicate whether a diner intends to continue eating or has finished.

==Cutlery placement after eating==

In the United States, a diner may place all their utensils together in a &quot;4-o&#x27;clock&quot; position on their plate, to indicate to waiting staff that they have finished their course and the plate may be taken away.

==Chopstick etiquette==
While etiquette customs for using chopsticks are broadly similar from region to region, finer points can differ. In some Asian cultures, it is considered impolite to point with chopsticks, or to leave them resting in a bowl. Leaving chopsticks standing in a bowl can be perceived as resembling offerings to the deceased or spirits.

<text>The Intelligence Corps (Int Corps) is a corps of the British Army. It is responsible for gathering, analysing and disseminating military intelligence and also for counter-intelligence and security. The Director of the Intelligence Corps is a brigadier.

==History==
===1814–1914===
In the 19th century, British intelligence work was undertaken by the Intelligence Department of the War Office. An important figure was Sir Charles Wilson, a Royal Engineer who successfully pushed for reform of the War Office&#x27;s treatment of topographical work.

In the early 1900s intelligence gathering was becoming better understood, to the point where a counter-intelligence organisation (MI5) was formed by the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DoMI) under Captain (later Major-General) Vernon Kell; overseas intelligence gathering began in 1912 by MI6 under Commander (later Captain) Mansfield Smith-Cumming.

===1914–1929===
Although the first proposals to create an intelligence corps came in 1905, the first Intelligence Corps was formed in August 1914 and originally included only officers and their servants. It left for France on 12 August 1914. The Royal Flying Corps was formed to monitor the ground, and provided aerial photographs for the Corps to analyse.

During the Irish War of Independence, Intelligence Corps operatives were used to monitor the Irish Republican Army. On Bloody Sunday (1920) 15 British Military Officers and civilians were shot and killed during multiple attacks in Dublin. Of the 15 killed six were Army Intelligence Officers, two were Courts Martial Officers, one was a senior Staff Officer serving with Irish Command (Brevet Lieut-Colonel Hugh Montgomery), three policemen (all former British military), two civilians (all former British military) and one local civilian. Following the war the Intelligence Corps was gradually scaled down and disbanded entirely in 1929; intelligence matters were left to individual unit officers.

===Second World War===
On 19 July 1940 a new Intelligence Corps was created by Army Order 112 and has existed since that time. The Army had been unprepared for collecting intelligence for deployment to France, and the only intelligence had been collected by Major Sir Gerald Templer. The Corps trained operatives to parachute at RAF Ringway; some of these were then dropped over France as part of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Intelligence Corps officers were involved in forming the highly-effective Long Range Desert Group, and Corps officer Lt Col Peter Clayton was one of the four founders of the Special Air Service (SAS). Around 40 per cent of British Army personnel at Bletchley Park were in the Intelligence Corps.

The Combined Allied Intelligence Corps as it was known in Malta, began recruiting in 1940 following Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of Germany. Among its many responsibilities in the Mediterranean Theatre were debriefing and interrogation of high-ranking prisoners of war in East Africa following Mussolini&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia (&quot;Eldoret&quot; P.O.W. Camp no. 365 being one example), counter-intelligence operations following Operation Husky the Allied invasion of Sicily in August 1943, and implementation of the Allied Screening Commission. The commission was established by Field-Marshal Sir Harold Alexander a few days after the fall of Rome in June 1944 to identify and reimburse Italian civilians who had assisted Allied escapees.

===Cold War===
Throughout the Cold War, Intelligence Corps officers and NCOs (with changed insignia) were posted behind the Iron Curtain in East Germany, to join in the intelligence-gathering activities of the British Commanders&#x27;-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany (Brixmis).

===Northern Ireland===
Many members of the Intelligence Corps served in Northern Ireland during &quot;the Troubles&quot;. Units such as the Military Reaction Force, Special Reconnaissance Unit, Force Research Unit and 14 Intelligence Company contained Corps soldiers and officers.

===Designation===
On 1 February 1985 the corps was officially declared an &#x27;Arm&#x27; (combat support) instead of a &#x27;Service&#x27; (rear support).

==Corps traditions==
Intelligence Corps personnel wear a distinctive cypress green beret with a cap badge consisting of a union rose (a red rose with a white centre) between two laurel branches and surmounted by a crown. Their motto is &quot;Manui Dat Cognitio Vires&quot; (&quot;Knowledge gives Strength to the Arm&quot;). The corps&#x27; quick march is &quot;The Rose &amp; Laurel&quot; while its slow march is Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Trumpet Tune &amp; Ayre&quot;.

Within the British Army, soldiers of the Intelligence Corps are often referred to as Green Slime, or sometimes simply &#x27;Slime&#x27;, due to the colour of their beret.

==Locations==
Their headquarters, formerly at Maresfield Camp, East Sussex, then Templer Barracks at Ashford, Kent, moved in 1997 to MOD Chicksands in Bedfordshire along with the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre (DISC). DISC was renamed as Joint Intelligence Training Group in January 2015.

The Intelligence Corps Museum was created in 1969, and later renamed as the Military Intelligence Museum, now also at Chicksands. Because the museum is on a working military base, it can be visited by appointment only.

==Training and promotion==
The corps has a particularly high proportion of commissioned officers, many of them commissioned from the ranks, and also a high percentage of female members. Non-commissioned personnel join as an Operator Military Intelligence (OPMI) or Operator Military Technical Intelligence (OPTI). They do basic 14-week military training at either the Army Training Centre Pirbright, or the Army Training Regiment, Winchester. OPMI/OPTI soldiers then will complete a 20-week special-to-arm training at Templer Training Delivery Wing, Chicksands, at the end of which they are promoted to Lance Corporal and posted to a battalion.

<doc id="970386" wikidata="Q579928" url="?curid=970386" title="The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie">
<text>The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is a 2004 American animated adventure comedy film based on the television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. It was co-written, co-produced, and directed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg and features the series&#x27; regular voice cast consisting of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Clancy Brown, Rodger Bumpass, Mr. Lawrence, Jill Talley, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mary Jo Catlett. Guest stars Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeffrey Tambor voice new characters, and David Hasselhoff appears in live-action as himself. In the film, Plankton enacts a plan to discredit his business nemesis Mr. Krabs, steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and take over the world by stealing King Neptune&#x27;s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. SpongeBob and Patrick team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune&#x27;s wrath and their world from Plankton&#x27;s rule.

Hillenburg accepted an offer for a film adaptation of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; from Paramount Pictures in 2002, after turning it down multiple times the previous year. He assembled a team from the show&#x27;s writing staff, including himself, Derek Drymon, Tim Hill, Kent Osborne, Aaron Springer, and Paul Tibbitt, and structured the film as a mythical hero&#x27;s journey that would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended to serve as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner, with Tibbitt taking his place.

&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on November 14, 2004, and was released in the United States on November 19. It received generally positive reviews and grossed $141 million worldwide, becoming the seventh highest-grossing animated film of 2004. Two sequels have since been released: &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (2015) and &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; (2020), with a fourth film, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants&quot; set to be released on December 19, 2025.

== Plot ==

The film opens with a band of pirates finding a treasure chest containing tickets to &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, and enthusiastically head to the theater to watch the film.

In the film proper, set in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, Eugene Krabs opens a second location of his popular restaurant, the Krusty Krab, next door to the original. His positive fry cook, SpongeBob SquarePants, hopes to be made manager of his second establishment, but Krabs instead chooses his co-worker, Squidward Tentacles, explaining to SpongeBob that as a &quot;kid&quot;, he is too immature to handle the job. Depressed, SpongeBob heads to the Goofy Goober ice cream parlor, where he and his best friend Patrick Star overindulge in ice cream. Meanwhile, Krabs&#x27; rival Plankton, owner of the unpopular Chum Bucket, puts &quot;Plan Z&quot; into effect. He steals King Neptune&#x27;s crown, sends it to Shell City, and frames Krabs for the crime.

King Neptune confronts Krabs about his stolen crown at the Krusty Krab 2, becoming further convinced of his guilt when SpongeBob, feeling the effects of the previous night, smears him. Immediately regretful, SpongeBob offers to retrieve the crown from Shell City himself; Neptune freezes Krabs and orders SpongeBob to return within six days or Krabs will be executed. Neptune&#x27;s daughter Mindy encourages SpongeBob, but warns him of a dangerous Cyclops that lurks near Shell City.

SpongeBob and Patrick head for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a Krabby Patty-shaped car stored underneath the restaurant. Immediately upon leaving Bikini Bottom, they are carjacked. They follow the thief to a dive bar, where they cause a scene by blowing bubbles in the bathroom, but manage to escape with the car.

Meanwhile, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula from the frozen Krabs and uses it to sell Krabby Patties at the Chum Bucket, where he gives away free helmets that brainwash customers into doing Plankton&#x27;s bidding. He subsequently takes over Bikini Bottom and renames it &quot;Planktopolis&quot;, hiring a hitman named Dennis to prevent SpongeBob from returning with the crown.

SpongeBob and Patrick come across a hazardous trench, lose the Patty Wagon again, and consider giving up. Mindy appears and gives them encouragement by applying fake mustaches made of seaweed, making them believe she magically transformed them from &quot;kids&quot; into men. With newfound confidence, the two successfully cross the trench but run into Dennis on the other side. He pulls the mustaches off and prepares to crush the pair with his giant boot, but is himself stepped on by a bigger boot - which belongs to the &quot;Cyclops&quot; (actually a human diver) who takes the duo away.

SpongeBob and Patrick wake up in a fish bowl before being placed under a heat lamp by the Cyclops, and discover that they are in &quot;Shell City&quot;: a gift shop where dried sea creatures are sold as souvenirs. Proud of having achieved their goal despite their imminent deaths, the two each shed a single tear before dying. The tears they shed end up short-circuiting the lamp, activating the emergency sprinkler system, and reviving them and the dried sea creatures. While the rest of the sea creatures attack the Cyclops, the pair take the crown and head to the beach, where David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride home. Dennis catches up to them and fights the pair on Hasselhoff&#x27;s back, eventually getting knocked into the sea when Hasselhoff passes underneath a catamaran.

Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Krabs, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just in time. Plankton drops a mind-control helmet on Neptune and surrounds SpongeBob, Patrick and Mindy with his army of slaves. SpongeBob, embracing the fact that he&#x27;s accomplished so much despite being a kid, uses the power of rock and roll to play &quot;Goofy Goober Rock&quot;, freeing Neptune and the citizens of Bikini Bottom from Plankton&#x27;s control. Plankton is arrested, Neptune unfreezes Krabs and SpongeBob is made manager of the Krusty Krab 2.

In a post-credits scene, an usher informs the pirates that the film is over and orders them to leave the theater.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had approached series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a film based on the show, but he refused for more than a year. Hillenburg was concerned, after watching &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999) and &quot;Toy Story&quot; (1995) with his son, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he called the SpongeBob &quot;cadence&quot;. Hillenburg believed that, &quot;to do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think this had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure. That&#x27;s where the comedy&#x27;s coming from, having these two naïve characters, SpongeBob and Patrick, a doofus and an idiot, on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them.&quot;
In 2002, Hillenburg and the show&#x27;s staff stopped making episodes to work on the film after the show&#x27;s third season. The film&#x27;s plot originally had SpongeBob rescue Patrick from a fisherman in Florida; an obvious reference to the film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), this was later said by Tom Kenny (the voice of SpongeBob) to be a &quot;joke&quot; plot to keep fans busy. Hillenburg directed and produced the film, and also co-wrote it with five other writer-animators from the show (Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill) over a three-month period in a room of a former Glendale, California bank. Osborne said, &quot;It was hugely fun  although it did get kind of gamey in there.&quot; At the beginning of the series, Hillenburg screened a number of silent shorts (from Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin, and Buster Keaton) and work by two modern comic actors: Jerry Lewis and Pee-wee Herman, both obvious inspirations for SpongeBob. For the film, the writers created a mythical hero&#x27;s quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. Bill Fagerbakke (the voice of Patrick) said about the plot, &quot;It&#x27;s just nuts. I&#x27;m continually dazzled and delighted with what these guys came up with.&quot;

When the film was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series &quot;so it wouldn&#x27;t jump the shark&quot;. However, Nickelodeon desired more episodes; Hillenburg stated: &quot;Well, there was concern when we did the movie [in 2004] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon.&quot; As a result, Hillenburg resigned as the series&#x27; showrunner, appointing writer, director, and storyboard artist Paul Tibbitt to succeed him. Tibbitt was one of Hillenburg&#x27;s favorite crew members: &quot;[I] totally trusted him.&quot; Tibbitt would remain showrunner until he was succeeded in 2015 by the show&#x27;s creative director Vincent Waller and staff writer Marc Ceccarelli. He also acted as an executive producer from 2008 to 2018. While Hillenburg no longer wrote or directly ran the show on a day-to-day basis, he reviewed each episode and submitted suggestions: &quot;I figure when I&#x27;m pretty old I can still paint I don&#x27;t know about running shows.&quot; Kenny, Fagerbakke, and the crew confirmed that they had completed four episodes for broadcast on Nickelodeon in early 2005, and planned to finish a total of about 20 for the fourth season. In 2015, Hillenburg returned to the show following the completion of the second film as an executive producer, having greater creative input and attending crew meetings until his death on November 26, 2018.

In September 2003, Jules Engel, Hillenburg&#x27;s mentor when he studied experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, died. Hillenburg dedicated the film to him: &quot;He truly was the most influential artistic person in my life. I consider him my &#x27;Art Dad.&#x27;&quot;

=== Casting ===

The film stars the series&#x27; main cast members: Tom Kenny as SpongeBob SquarePants, Gary the Snail, and the French Narrator, Bill Fagerbakke as Patrick Star, Rodger Bumpass as Squidward Tentacles, Clancy Brown as Mr. Krabs, Mr. Lawrence as Plankton, Jill Talley as Karen, Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks, Mary Jo Catlett as Mrs. Puff, and Lori Alan as Pearl Krabs. It also features Dee Bradley Baker as Perch Perkins, Carlos Alazraqui as King Neptune&#x27;s squire, Aaron Hendry as the Cyclops, and Neil Ross as the voice of the Cyclops. In addition to the series&#x27; cast, it was reported on March 23, 2004, that Scarlett Johansson, Jeffrey Tambor, and Alec Baldwin would voice new characters Princess Mindy, King Neptune, and Dennis, respectively, and David Hasselhoff would appear as himself.

Johansson accepted the role because she liked cartoons and was a fan of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. When Tambor signed for his voice cameo, he saw his character (King Neptune) and joked, &quot;This is me.&quot; He remembered the first cartoon he saw, &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942): &quot;My first cartoon, I had to be carried out crying. It was &quot;Bambi&quot;. It&#x27;s like the great American wound: the death of Bambi&#x27;s mother. &#x27;Run, Bambi, run!&#x27;&quot; Stephen Hillenburg said that Baldwin recorded his character Dennis on a &quot;phone&quot;: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say that about his performance. He might be mad if we said that. Technically, it was like he was in another booth in the studio.&quot;

Hasselhoff accepted the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: &quot;I got an offer to do a cameo in the &quot;SpongeBob Movie&quot; and I turned to my girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s SpongeBob?&#x27; and they said, &#x27;Oh my gosh, Dad, it&#x27;s the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.&#x27;&quot; Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: &quot;It was great fun and to this day around the world kids stop me and say, &#x27;Are you David Hasselhoff?&#x27; because I was the only human in the picture.&quot; Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: &quot;It&#x27;s amazing - so many of the kids were so young and didn&#x27;t see &quot;Baywatch&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider&quot; so I got a whole new legion of fans.&quot;

=== Animation ===
There were a number of stages involved in the making of the film, beginning with a rough animation process of ideas drawn on Post-it notes. The writers drew, working from rough outlines rather than scripts (which made the humor more visual than verbal). The storyboard artists, including Sherm Cohen, then illustrated ideas conceived by the writers. In the series Tom Yasumi and Andrew Overtoom do the animatics, but Hillenburg and Drymon did the animatics for the film. Yasumi and Overtoom were the film&#x27;s animation-timing directors, concentrating on the sheets. &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, like the series, was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. The animators worked semi-digitally with pencil-drawn poses that would be composited into layouts in Photoshop.

Series writer and storyboard artist Erik Wiese left the show for a year to work on &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; and &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, but returned to do storyboards and character layout for the film. He &quot;always wanted to be a feature animator, and the movie felt like I was on the character animation end&quot;, describing the experience as &quot;a blast it felt like coming home.&quot;

Hillenburg enjoyed the process of making the film: &quot;The TV schedule is tight, and you don&#x27;t always have a lot of time to work on your drawings.&quot; He appreciated the film&#x27;s hand-drawn animation: &quot;I think the movie&#x27;s drawings are much superior than the TV show&quot;, although CGI animation was flourishing at the time of the film&#x27;s release. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of talk about 2-D being dead, and I hope people don&#x27;t think that. Even Brad Bird is a proponent of 2-D. He would agree with me that it&#x27;s all about what you&#x27;re trying to say. There are many ways to tell a story, and what&#x27;s unique about animation is that there are many styles with which to tell a story.&quot; The clay animation scenes were shot by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Chris Finnegan at Screen Novelties in Los Angeles.

=== Filming ===
The film features live-action scenes directed by Mark Osborne in Santa Monica, California. The ship used during the 30-second opening featuring the pirates singing the theme song was the &quot;Bounty&quot;, a -long, enlarged reconstruction of the 1787 Royal Navy sailing ship HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; built for &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962). The ship appeared in a number of other films, including &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1999), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; (2006), and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot; (2007). In film trailers, live-action scenes were taken from &quot;Das Boot&quot; (1981), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), and &quot;U-571&quot; (2000).
David Hasselhoff made a cameo in the live-action scenes, offering SpongeBob and Patrick a ride to Bikini Bottom. The scene was originally written before consulting Hasselhoff. Hillenburg was pleased with the storyboards; Lead storyboard artist Sherm Cohen said, &quot;He had been wrestling with the ending for quite a while, and finally he was ready to pitch his ideas to some of the other board artists.&quot; Hillenburg was counting on casting Hasselhoff, and the first question he asked him was &quot;So, do we have Hasselhoff?&quot; He replied &quot;No&quot;, with a grin. Hasselhoff eventually agreed, before seeing the script. Hillenburg said about the actor, &quot;He&#x27;s a great guy. ... He was great at making fun of himself.&quot;

The crew built a , replica of Hasselhoff. The $100,000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff&#x27;s home; he has said, &quot;It freaked me out because it was so lifelike, with teeth, when you touch it it feels like real skin. It&#x27;s soft, like your skin.&quot; At the completion of filming, Hasselhoff said, &quot;That&#x27;s ridiculously awesome. What are you gonna do with it?&quot; Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, &quot;Uh, yeah. Okay.&quot; Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea; he described the experience as &quot;cold but a lot of fun.&quot;

In late March 2014, Hasselhoff offered the replica up for auction with other memorabilia collected during his career. Julien&#x27;s Auctions handled the item&#x27;s sale, which was expected to bring in between $20,000 and $30,000. Ultimately, Hasselhoff pulled the item, just a few days before the auction.

=== Deleted scenes ===

The DVD and Blu-ray releases include animatics of deleted scenes from the film, including SpongeBob and Patrick&#x27;s meeting with Sandy Cheeks (a squirrel) on the surface after they escape from Shell City. Patrick repeatedly vomits, upset by Sandy&#x27;s unusual appearance. The squirrel is pursued by black-suited exterminators, and defends herself with acorns. She informs SpongeBob and Patrick that they can return to Bikini Bottom by taking a bus at the beach. This idea was later used for the second film &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (2015), where Sandy became a giant realistic squirrel.

In 2013, the film&#x27;s lead storyboard artist, Sherm Cohen, released a storyboard panel of a deleted scene from the film with SpongeBob awakening from his dream saying &quot;WEEEEE!&quot; and Mr. Krabs holding a manager&#x27;s hat.

== Soundtrack ==

Gregor Narholz composed the score for the film, conducting the recording sessions (in 5.1 surround sound) with the London Metropolitan Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. Narholz was signed when series music editor Nick Carr recommended him to Hillenburg after they worked together at the Associated Production Music library. Narholz was honored at the 2005 ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards for his work on the film, and received a nomination for Music in an Animated Feature Production at the 32nd Annie Awards.
American rock band The Flaming Lips recorded &quot;SpongeBob And Patrick Confront the Psychic Wall of Energy&quot;. They shot the song&#x27;s music video, directed by band member Wayne Coyne and filmmaker Bradley Beesley, in Austin, Texas. Coyne said, &quot;Stephen Hillenburg seems to be a fan of the weirder music of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s. He wanted to evoke the music he got turned onto back then.&quot; Coyne suggested a duet with Justin Timberlake, but Hillenburg refused, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t want any of those sort of commercial weirdos on there. I don&#x27;t like those commercial people. I like you guys, and Wilco and Ween.&quot; American band Wilco wrote and recorded &quot;Just a Kid&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s producers contacted frontman Jeff Tweedy after seeing a SpongeBob air freshener hanging from Tweedy&#x27;s rearview mirror in &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco&quot; (2002). Tweedy said, &quot;I fell in love with SpongeBob when I heard him describe the darkness at the bottom of the sea as &#x27;advanced darkness&#x27;. How could I not write a song for this film? It automatically makes me the coolest dad on the block.&quot; Avril Lavigne recorded the series&#x27; theme for the soundtrack. Other artists contributing to the soundtrack were Motörhead, singing &quot;You Better Swim&quot; (a derivative of their 1992 song &quot;You Better Run&quot;); Prince Paul (&quot;Prince Paul&#x27;s Bubble Party&quot;); Ween (&quot;Ocean Man&quot;), and the Shins (&quot;They&#x27;ll Soon Discover&quot;, partially written in 2001).

&quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;, written by Tom Kenny (SpongeBob&#x27;s voice actor) and Andy Paley, was featured in the film and on its soundtrack. Kenny and Paley were working on what would become the album &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;, writing &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot; and &quot;Under My Rock&quot;. The film&#x27;s production team needed two more tracks for the soundtrack; Hillenburg heard the songs, and decided to include them. &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot; ended up being played during the film&#x27;s closing credits.

== Marketing ==
=== Promotion ===
Julia Pistor, the film&#x27;s co-producer, said that although Nickelodeon (which owns the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; trademark) wanted to sell character-themed backpacks, lunch boxes, and wristwatches it respected Hillenburg&#x27;s integrity and gave him control of merchandising. Hillenburg had no problem with candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats&#x27; simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was &quot;full of hidden additives.&quot; Pistor said, &quot;The trouble is that you can&#x27;t go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in. People don&#x27;t take you seriously.&quot; Hillenburg replied, &quot;Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn&#x27;t do that. We didn&#x27;t want to suddenly become the people serving up food that&#x27;s not that good for you, especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that&#x27;s crossing the line. I don&#x27;t want to be the Pied Piper of fast food.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; estimated the media value was $150 million.

The film was promoted across the United States. Nickelodeon joined Burger King for a 12-figure toy line based on the film, and about 4,700 Burger King stores perched , inflatable SpongeBob figures on their roofs as part of the promotion (one of the largest in fast food history). Customers could also purchase one of five different SpongeBob-themed watches for $1.99 with the purchase of a value meal.

On November 11, 2004, it was reported that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, &quot;As to the motives behind these apparent &#x27;spongenappings&#x27;, we can only speculate. We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota.&quot; The chain offered a year&#x27;s supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: &quot;We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes.&quot; Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; Simon said, &quot;Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody.&quot; The following year, Burger King took &quot;extra security precautions&quot; in response to the SpongeBob incident, when Stormtroopers from George Lucas&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; guarded the delivery of &quot;Star Wars&quot; toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood as part of a promotion for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005).

The Cayman Islands joined with Nickelodeon to create the first Cayman Islands Sea School with SpongeBob for the film. The partnership was announced by Pilar Bush, Deputy Director of Tourism for the Cayman Islands, on March 10, 2004. As part of the agreement, the Cayman partnership was seen on Nickelodeon&#x27;s global multimedia platforms, including on-air, online, and in magazines. Other promotional partners included Mitsubishi, Holiday Inn, Kellogg&#x27;s, and Perfetti Van Melle.

In 2005, Nickelodeon and Simon Spotlight released a book, &quot;Ice-Cream Dreams&quot;, as a tie-in to the film. It was written by Nancy E. Krulik and illustrated by Heather Martinez, with Krulik and Derek Drymon as contributors.

=== &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; 300 ===
On October 15, 2004, the film was the first to sponsor a NASCAR race: the , Busch Series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; 300 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. It was the first race of its kind where children at the track could listen to a special, &quot;kid-friendly&quot; radio broadcast of the event.

Kyle Busch and Jimmie Johnson debuted a pair of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;-themed Chevrolet race cars in the race. Johnson&#x27;s No. 48 Chevrolet included an image of SpongeBob across the hood, and Busch&#x27;s No. 5 Chevrolet featured Patrick Star. Johnson said, &quot;This sounds so cool I know there are a lot of families who will be excited that Lowe&#x27;s is doing this. The great thing is there will be something for every type of race fan. Plus how can we go wrong with SpongeBob helping us out on the car?&quot;

== Release ==

=== Theatrical ===
&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; premiered on November 14, 2004, at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. It was released in the United States on November 19. Among celebrities who saw the premiere with their children were Ray Romano, Larry King, Ice Cube, Gary Dourdan, and Lisa Kudrow. The carpet was a reminder of home for Tom Kenny, SpongeBob&#x27;s voice actor; he said, &quot;I have a 15-month-old daughter, so I&#x27;m no stranger to yellow carpets.&quot;

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on March 1, 2005, in wide- and full-screen editions, by Paramount Home Entertainment. The VHS release is known for being the last animated film by Nickelodeon Movies to be released on the platform. The DVD special features include an 18-minute featurette, &quot;The Absorbing Tale Behind The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, featuring interviews with most of the principal cast and crew; a 15-minute featurette, &quot;Case of the Sponge &quot;Bob&quot;&quot;, hosted by Jean-Michel Cousteau; a 20-minute animatic segment featuring scenes from the film with dialogue by the original artists, and the film&#x27;s trailer. As a tie-in to the film&#x27;s DVD release, 7-Eleven served a limited-edition Under-the-Sea Pineapple Slurpee in March 2005.

The film was released as a Blu-ray-plus-DVD combination pack on March 29, 2011, alongside &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. It was re-released on DVD and Blu-ray on December 30, 2014. A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray Steelbook was released on July 16, 2024 to commemorate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; earned $9,559,752 on its opening day in the United States, second behind &quot;National Treasure&quot; (2004) (which earned $11 million). It grossed a combined total of $32,018,216 during its opening weekend, on 4,300 screens at 3,212 theaters, averaging $9,968 per venue (or $7,446 per screen, again second to &quot;National Treasure&quot;). The film dropped an unexpected 44 percent over the Thanksgiving weekend, and 57 percent the weekend after that. The opening weekend earned 37.48 percent of the film&#x27;s final gross. It closed on March 24, 2005, failing to out-gross holiday animated competitors &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004) ($261,441,092) and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004) ($183,373,735). It was still profitable for distributor Paramount Pictures and producer Nickelodeon Movies, earning $85,417,988 in the United States and $140,161,792 worldwide on a budget of $30 million.

=== Critical response ===

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, &quot;Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; a score of 66 out of 100 based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, calling it &quot;the &quot;Good Burger&quot; of animation plopping us down inside a fast-food war being fought by sponges, starfish, crabs, tiny plankton and mighty King Neptune.&quot; Ed Park of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote, &quot;No Pixar? No problem! An unstoppable good-mood generator, the resolutely 2-D [&quot;The&quot;] &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; has more yuks than &quot;Shark Tale&quot; (2004) and enough soul to swallow &quot;The Polar Express&quot; whole.&quot; Michael Rechtshaffen of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;an animated adventure that&#x27;s funnier than &quot;Shark Tale&quot; and more charming than &quot;The Polar Express&quot;.&quot; Randy Cordova of &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; said, &quot;Like the TV show it&#x27;s based on, it&#x27;s a daffy, enjoyable creation.&quot; Jami Bernard of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the feature a score of three out of four: &quot;It&#x27;s not &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, or one of those animated features that spent zillions on character design, pedigree and verisimilitude. But SpongeBob is a sweet, silly thing with a child-friendly esthetic all its own.&quot; Will Lawrence of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four out of five stars, calling it &quot;a film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a B-minus grade: &quot;The best moments in his [SpongeBob SquarePants] first movie outing are those that feel most TV-like, just another day in the eternally optimistic undersea society created with such contagious silliness by Stephen Hillenburg.&quot; Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; enjoyed the film: &quot;You gotta love SpongeBob. Coolest sponge in the sea, although this one has a suspiciously manufactured look.&quot;

Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; retains the 2-D charm of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cartoon but adds a few tricks a little 3-D here, a little David Hasselhoff there. The series&#x27; appeal never lay in its visuals, however. &#x27;SpongeBob&#x27; endeared itself to kids and adults through sweetness and cleverness, also abundant here.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a score of four out of five: &quot;If you&#x27;re tired of bluster and swagger, SpongeBob is your man.&quot; Tom Maurstad of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; also gave the film a B-minus grade: &quot;Being so good is what led to making the movie, and it&#x27;s also the reason that many small-screen episodes are better than this big-screen venture.&quot;

Some reviews praised David Hasselhoff&#x27;s appearance in the film. Jennifer Frey of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;Getting to see the hairs on Hasselhoff&#x27;s back (and thighs, and calves) magnified exponentially is perhaps a bit creepy. Like the movie, it&#x27;s all in good fun.&quot; Cinema Blend founder Joshua Tyler called Hasselhoff&#x27;s role &quot;the best movie cameo I&#x27;ve seen since Fred Savage stuck a joint in his crotch and played a clarinet to charm the resulting smoke like a snake.&quot;
David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s plot, calling it a &quot;big, heavy anchor of a story structure to weigh him down.&quot; Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;harmlessly off-the-cuff — but facing far more pedigreed multiplex competition — &quot;SpongeBob&quot; barely rates as OK when compared with &quot;The Incredibles&quot;.&quot; A reviewer noted in &quot;Time Out London&quot;, &quot;Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.&quot; In his &quot;Variety&quot; review, Todd McCarthy said the film &quot;takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion.&quot;

While the film received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans of the show, it is considered a turning point in the show&#x27;s history; many fans believe that the television series has declined in quality since the film&#x27;s release. While episodes aired before the film were praised for their &quot;uncanny brilliance&quot;, those aired after the film have been called &quot;kid-pandering attention-waster[s]&quot;, &quot;tedious&quot;, &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;dreck&quot;, a &quot;depressing plateau of mediocrity&quot; and &quot;laugh-skimpy.&quot; After the film&#x27;s release, fans &quot;began to turn away from the show,&quot; causing fansites to &quot;bec[ome] deserted.&quot; Some fans believe that the show&#x27;s 2012 ratings decline correlates with a decline in quality, and &quot;whatever fan support [the show] enjoys is not enough&quot; to save it from its slide in ratings. This was because Stephen Hillenburg and many writers left the show.

=== Accolades ===


=== Fan project ===

In honor of Stephen Hillenburg, a non-profit reanimated collaboration project, titled &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Rehydrated&quot;, was released online on May 1, 2022. Similarly to 3GI&#x27;s &quot;Shrek Retold&quot; collaboration, the video consists of over 300 artists recreating the film&#x27;s animation and audio in their own artistic styles. Amid the YouTube premiere, the video was taken down by Paramount Global due to copyright laws. As a result, the hashtag #JusticeForSpongeBob became trending on Twitter against Paramount&#x27;s action. The video was restored the following day.

== Video game ==

A video game based on the film was released for PlayStation 2 PC, Game Boy Advance, Xbox, and GameCube on October 27, 2004 for Mac OS X in 2005 and PlayStation 3 on February 7, 2012. The home-console version was developed by Heavy Iron Studios; the Game Boy Advance version was developed by WayForward Technologies and published by THQ.

It was created on the same engine as &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom&quot;, which uses RenderWare. Game developer Heavy Iron Studios tweaked the graphics to give the game a sharper and more imaginative look than &quot;Battle for Bikini Bottom&quot;. It increased the polygon count, added several racing levels, and incorporated many creatures from the film. The game&#x27;s plot was based on the film, with SpongeBob and Patrick on a mission taking them outside Bikini Bottom to retrieve Neptune&#x27;s crown. On October 4, 2004, THQ announced the game&#x27;s mobile release. Nickelodeon vice-president for new-media business development Paul Jelinek said, &quot;As one of the leading publishers of wireless entertainment content, THQ Wireless is introducing the SpongeBob SquarePants license to a whole new audience of gamers THQ has been a great partner to Nickelodeon over the years and we look forward to the same standard of excellence with these upcoming SpongeBob SquarePants games for wireless devices.&quot; The mobile console was developed by Amplified Games.

== Standalone sequels ==
=== &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; ===

A second movie, which was announced in February 2012, was directed by Paul Tibbitt, written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, and executive-produced by Stephen Hillenburg, who co-wrote the story with Tibbit. Paramount stated in early June 2014 that the film would be released on February 6, 2015. The film involves SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Plankton and Sandy taking back the Krabby Patty secret formula from a pirate that stole it, resulting in them making it to land.

=== &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; ===

The third movie, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot;, was announced in late 2019 and was released on August 14, 2020, in Canada and on March 4, 2021, on Paramount+ in the United States. Tim Hill served as the director and the screenplay was written by Aaron Springer with Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. The film follows SpongeBob and Patrick on a rescue mission to save Gary, and reveals how SpongeBob and Gary met at Kamp Koral.

<doc id="970390" wikidata="Q5232273" url="?curid=970390" title="USS Bluefish (SSN-675)">
<text>USS &quot;Bluefish&quot; (SSN-675), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bluefish.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Bluefish&quot; was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 15 July 1966 and her keel was laid down there on 13 March 1968. She was launched on 10 January 1970, sponsored by Mrs. David Packard, and commissioned on 8 January 1971.

==Propulsion Methods==

The USS Bluefish was propelled by one S5W Nuclear reactor. S5W stands for S = Submarine Platform, 5 = Fifth Generation Core and W = Westinghouse as the contracted designer. The S5W is a high speed submarine reactor with the average power of 78 MWth (MegaWatt thermal) or 15,000 SHP (Shaft Horse Power). From the time the submarine was laid to its scrapping, the S5W core lifetime would last 5,500 hours at full power for older model S5Ws to 10,000 hours at full power for newer core models.

==Armament==
The USS &quot;Bluefish&quot; had a wide variety of weapons systems available for its use. The armament included 4 x 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo Tubes, Mark 48 torpedoes; UUM-44 SUBROC anti-submarine missiles; UGM-84A/C Harpoon missiles (anti-ship), Mark 57 deep-water mines (anti-ship/submarine), and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines (anti-submarine)

The Mark 48 torpedo has been in the U.S. Navy since 1972. Each , torpedo has a piston engine and pump jet capable of accelerating it past . The official range is greater than and it can be fired at depths down to underwater. The torpedo is guided by passive/aggressive accusative homing or wire guidance to deliver its warhead to the target. Each unit costs an average of 2.5 million dollars to produce.

The UUM-44A SUBROC missile is an anti-submarine missile. Unlike your average anti-submarine missile, the UUM-44A is designed to be fired out of the submarine into the air where it calculates its targets position and flies 55 kilometers to impact point. This weapon is so powerful it doesn&#x27;t have to have a direct impact to cause significant damage to its target with its 39-inch, 460 pound W-55 thermonuclear warhead. This missile is propelled by Thiokol TE-260G solid-fuel and has the capabilities to go supersonic. The weight of each unit is 4000 pounds (1800 kg).

The UGM-84A/C Harpoon missiles are the dedicated anti-ship missiles used in the US Navy. Each unit is propelled by a Teledyne/CAE J402-CA-400 turbojet and has the range of approximately 220 km. The traveling speed of this anti-ship missile is Mach 0.85. Its warhead weights 488 pounds (221 kg) and is officially called a WDU-18/B penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead.

The Mark 57 deep-water mines were deployed beginning in 1966. The detection system to cause the fatal explosion was a total field magnetic exploder. The warhead was a HBX-3 warhead that weighed 340 pounds. The whole mine weighed 2000 pounds (909 kg) and could be laid at up to 1000 feet (305 meters).

Mark 60 CAPTOR mines begin being deployed in 1979. It is powered by a two-speed, reciprocating external combustion engine, and has a range of 8,000 yards at 28 knots. The mine weighs 2056 pounds (935 kg) with a 98-pound PBXN-103 high explosive bulk charge warhead. Its detection system is reliable acoustic path (RAP) sound propagation with a snake or circle search pattern in launch mode.

==Service history==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; circumnavigated the globe near the North Pole on 3 May 1975 and surfaced at the North Pole on 4 May 1975.
&quot;Bluefish&quot; may have been the only Sturgeon class submarine to circumnavigate the globe during extended patrol in the Indian Ocean in 1982.
Bluefish was designed for stealth and surveillance, and was an integral part of the US NAVY&#x27;s strategic defense during the height of the Cold War.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Bluefish&quot; was decommissioned with Commander Richard C. West in command on 31 May 1996 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, was completed on 1 November 2003.

<text>USS &quot;Spadefish&quot; (SSN-668), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the spadefish, a spiny-finned fish found in coastal waters of the western Atlantic from Cuba to Cape Cod.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Spadefish&quot; was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 9 March 1965 and her keel was laid down there on 21 December 1966. She was launched on 15 May 1968, sponsored by Mrs. Charles T. Booth, and commissioned on 14 August 1969.

==Service history==
===1969-1984===
&quot;Spadefish&quot; was assigned Norfolk, Virginia, as her home port, and it remained her home port throughout her career. She was attached to Submarine Squadron 6.

Following shakedown in the Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Spadefish&quot; underwent post-shakedown repairs and alterations at Newport News from April to June 1970 and in July 1970 participated in antisubmarine warfare exercises in the North Atlantic Ocean. After returning to her home port, Norfolk, Virginia, she deployed in the Atlantic from October to December 1970 and then returned to Norfolk for upkeep.

On 18 February 1971, &quot;Spadefish&quot; got underway for her second deployment in the Atlantic, visiting Faslane, Scotland, before returning to Norfolk on 18 April 1971. She operated in the Norfolk area for the remainder of 1971, participating in antisubmarine warfare exercises and attack submarine training.

In 1972, &quot;Spadefish&quot; participated in training operations in the Norfolk area until deploying in the Atlantic from June to August, visiting Holy Loch, Scotland, before returning to Norfolk. She again deployed in the Atlantic on 10 October 1972 and returned to Norfolk on 17 December 1972.

Through June 1973, &quot;Spadefish&quot; operated out of Norfolk along the United States East Coast. She conducted independent exercises, a fleet ballistic missile submarine security exercise, and independent attack submarine training. In May and June 1973, she supported Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla 8 in an Atlantic readiness exercise and a sea control exercise. At the end of June 1973, she spent a week at the Isle of Portland in England, and, in July 1973, returned to the U.S. East Coast. At the beginning of September 1973, she commenced a major at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; completed overhaul in July 1974 and resumed operations along the U.S. East Coast.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; operated in the Arctic on an Ice Exercise (ICEX) in 1984 under the command of Commander George Bardsley.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; operated in the Arctic on an ICEX in 1992 under the command of Commander R. B. Williams.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; again operated in the Arctic on an ICEX in 1993, still under the command of Commander Williams.

&quot;Spadefish&quot; completed two deployments to the Persian Gulf in 1995 and 1996, crossing the equator on both occasions. The 1996 deployment began at Pier 21 in Norfolk and ended at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington.

==Decommissioning and disposal==

&quot;Spadefish&quot; remained at Bremerton after her 1996 arrival, and was decommissioned there on 11 April 1997 under the command of Commander C. W. &quot;Buddy&quot; Puryear. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard began on 1 October 1996 and was completed on 24 October 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Puffer&quot; (SSN-652), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class nuclear attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pufferfish, a saltwater fish with toxic spines that can inflate its body with water or air and is one of the most poisonous vertebrates in the world.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Puffer&quot; was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 26 March 1963, and her keel was laid down there on 8 February 1965. She was launched on 30 March 1968, sponsored by Mrs. John B. Colwell, and commissioned on 9 August 1969.

==Service history==

Like all ships of her class in the Silent Service, USS &quot;Puffer&quot; conducted many operations that were critical to the needs of the nation and the U.S. Navy during the Cold War.

==1970s==

USS &quot;Puffer&quot; operated in the Pacific Ocean during the 1970s, earning two Navy Unit Commendations and at least one Presidential Unit Citation, among other awards. At least one of her commanding officers during the 1970s earned a Legion of Merit for his role in leading &quot;Puffer&quot; on a highly successful mission.

On 22 May 1978 a valve was mistakenly opened releasing up to 500 US gallons (1,900 L; 420 imp gal) of radioactive water into Puget Sound, during an overhaul in drydock at Bremerton Naval Shipyard.

==1980s==
As part of Submarine Squadron One, from May to October 1980 USS &quot;Puffer&quot;, under the command of Commander Howard W. Habermeyer, Jr., USN, conducted her fifth Westpac/Indian Ocean Cruise, visiting the ports of Hong Kong, Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, Guam, and Diego Garcia. On 18 July 1980 USS &quot;Puffer&quot; docked at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;, Rockingham, Western Australia for an R&amp;R visit, departing on 25 July 1980. After this deployment USS &quot;Puffer&quot; received her third Navy Unit Commendation.

After returning to Pearl Harbor from her 1980 Westpac cruise, USS &quot;Puffer&quot; conducted local operations from November 1980 to May 1981, when the submarine went into a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) which was completed in August 1981. During 1981 USS &quot;Puffer&quot; was awarded Submarine Squadron One&#x27;s Battle &#x27;E&#x27;, Engineering &#x27;E&#x27;, and Supply &#x27;E&#x27;. From September to late October 1981 USS &quot;Puffer&quot; conducted workups for her upcoming deployment.

USS &quot;Puffer&quot; conducted her sixth Westpac/Indian Ocean Cruise from November 1981 to 14 May 1982. Still under the command of Commander Habermeyer, USS &quot;Puffer&quot; again visited ports like Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, and Yokosuka, Japan. Again USS &quot;Puffer&quot; docked at HMAS &quot;Stirling&quot;, Rockingham, Western Australia for an R&amp;R visit from 10 to 17 February 1982. After this deployment USS &quot;Puffer&quot; received her fourth Navy Unit Commendation, as well as her second Submarine Squadron One Battle &#x27;E&#x27;.

==1989==
Prior to the filming of The Hunt for Red October, actor Sean Connery was on board preparing for his role as Captain Marko Ramius. He was given the honorary status of a Navy commander and was allowed (while the ship&#x27;s captain was next to him) to give orders while the ship was underway. (Ref. IMDb.com)

In &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, the scene for the flashing light sequence was filmed at sea off the coast of San Diego using &quot;Puffer&quot; and a captain&#x27;s gig from one of the submarine tenders located at the Point Loma submarine base. A mess cook who knew Morse Code was given a script. The eyepiece was removed from the Number 2 periscope and a large flashlight was used, since a modern submarine does not have (or need) the capability to transmit Morse code in the way that was shown in the film. &quot;Puffer&quot; is not listed in the film credits.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
After more than 25 years of service, &quot;Puffer&quot; was decommissioned on 12 July 1996 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. Her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, began on 20 October 1996 and was completed on 28 March 1997.

&quot;Puffer&quot;″s fairwater planes can be seen as part of &quot;The Fin Project&quot;, a permanent outdoor art installation on the shore of Lake Washington in Seattle, at Magnusson Park.

<text>Tarland (Gaelic: &quot;Turlann&quot;) is a village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland northwest of Aboyne, and west of Aberdeen. The population was 720 in 2016.

Tarland is home to the Culsh Earth House, an Iron Age below-ground dwelling otherwise known as a Souterrain.

Just south of Tarland is the Tomnaverie stone circle, a 4,000-year-old recumbent stone circle. The land is owned by the MacRobert Trust and in the care of Historic Scotland. The circle was recently restored with help from a donation by the trust.

Melgum Lodge near Tarland was originally built as a hunting lodge for the physician to Queen Victoria who frequently stayed in the vicinity at Balmoral Castle.

<text>Robotron 64 is a 1998 multidirectional shooter for the Nintendo 64. It is a port of &quot;Robotron X&quot;, which itself is an updated version of the 1982 dual-stick shooter &quot;&quot;. The game was originally scheduled to be released by Midway Games in the summer of 1997, but the game was put on hiatus before it would see a new publisher and a release date of January 5, 1998.

==Plot==
The player is a mutant scientist trapped in another dimension trying to save the last human family. His mutant powers allow him to defeat the evil robots that are trying to kill all of humanity.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Robotron 64&quot; uses the dual-stick control scheme of the original &quot;Robotron&quot;. The player has the option to use a single controller using the analog stick for movement and the C-buttons for firing, or use two controllers to allow use of both analog sticks for movement and shooting. 

The soundtrack consists of electronica and techno music.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;Robotron 64&quot; were mostly positive, though many critics questioned whether the game ultimately offered anything over the original &quot;Robotron 2084&quot;. Dan Hsu proclaimed in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Finally, a good update of Robotron! This version fixes all of the problems that plagued the PS version. R64 is fast, frantic and sure as hell hard to put down.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; likewise described it as &quot;just as fast and wild&quot; as &quot;Robotron 2084&quot;, while having upgraded graphics. &quot;Next Generation&quot; was more measured in its praise: &quot;Add to that new bosses and power-ups, hundreds of levels, and a decent non-stop techno soundtrack, and this tiny 4MB cart stands as proof that size isn&#x27;t everything – it&#x27;s what you do with it that counts. It still may not improve on the original, but it&#x27;s much better than expected.&quot; On the negative end of the spectrum, Hsu&#x27;s co-reviewer Sushi-X criticized the low difficulty and the lack of the full-screen overhead view of &quot;Robotron 2084&quot; and summed up &quot;Robotron 64&quot; as &quot;one last attempt at reviving a game that seems better left to fond memories.&quot; Jeff Gerstmann, reviewing the game for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, also felt it was too easy and concluded it &quot;simply isn&#x27;t up to snuff. You&#x27;d be better off playing the original &quot;Robotron 2084&quot;.&quot; The game holds 72/100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic based on six reviews.

&quot;GamePro&quot; disagreed about the game being easy, arguing that it only appears easy because the first 30 levels allow the player to breeze through while accumulating a number of surplus extra lives, and that the remaining 170 levels, which comprise the bulk of the game, are a challenge to master. While noting the music is a little repetitive, critics overwhelmingly praised it for its appropriately frenzied pace and mood. Gerstmann disagreed, saying the music is hampered by the storage limitations of the cartridge medium. The vast majority of critics found the graphics to be functional but wholly unimpressive, though there was a dissenting voice on this point as well, with &quot;GamePro&quot; applauding how well the character graphics and animation stand out among the game&#x27;s chaotic action.

Other commonly praised elements of the game included the huge number of stages and the way the camera views provide a much better view of the action than the PlayStation&#x27;s &quot;Robotron X&quot;. However, the most widely acclaimed feature of the game was the ability to use two controllers at once, which critics said evokes memories of the original &quot;Robotron 2084&quot; arcade machine&#x27;s dual joysticks while giving the control an impressive level of analog depth. Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot;, for example, commented that &quot;It sounds odd, but it is absolutely ingenious and replicates the same double-joystick control of the original arcade machine. It allows for so much movement possibility that addiction is inevitable.&quot;

<text>is a Japanese businessman best known as the founder and former president of Nintendo of America, and the co-founder of Tetris Online, Inc.

==Biography==
Minoru Arakawa was born on 3 September 1946 in Kyoto, Japan, the second son of Waichiro Arakawa and Michi Ishihara. His elder brother, Shoichi, later took over the family business. His sister married a professor of medicine. Waichiro was the manager of Arakawa Textiles, and was more concerned with maintaining positive relationships with suppliers and customers than growing the company. Michi was an artist, who spent afternoons in the family garden or her studio; her paintings were hung at their family home. Arakawa&#x27;s family was wealthy; the total real estate of Arakawa&#x27;s family combined was about one-fifth of the downtown district in Kyoto.

Arakawa began studying at Kyoto University in 1964, taking general classes for the first two years before focusing on civil engineering. He graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in 1969, before moving to Boston in 1971 to continue studying civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He witnessed several protests against the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, but did not participate. Arakawa graduated MIT with a second master&#x27;s degree in 1972. Following a conversation on campus with a group of young Japanese businessmen, he decided to try to find work with a trading company. Upon returning to Japan, he was hired by Marubeni, a company in Tokyo that developed hotels and office buildings. At a Christmas party in Kyoto, Arakawa met Yoko Yamauchi, daughter of Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi. They married in November 1973. Arakawa, along with his wife and three-year-old daughter Maki, moved to Vancouver, Canada in 1977 for work. A second daughter, Masayo, was born in 1978.

Hiroshi Yamauchi offered Arakawa the job of establishing Nintendo of America; while Yoko opposed the position, having seen the impact of the company on her father&#x27;s life, Arakawa accepted the offer. Arakawa and his wife established an office in Manhattan in 1980, and Arakawa became the company&#x27;s first president. He had modest success at importing arcade games from the parent company in Japan, and then betting his small company on a huge order of &quot;Radar Scope&quot; with disastrous reception. This failure prompted the parent company&#x27;s innovative creation of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, and he converted his warehouse full of useless &quot;Radar Scope&quot; units into a phenomenally successful inventory of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; units. This is the debut of Mario, who Arakawa is credited with naming after the office&#x27;s Italian landlord Mario Segale. Starting in 1985, he and Howard Lincoln were instrumental in rebuilding the North American video game industry from the crash of 1983, with the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Arakawa also hired Howard Phillips, who would be invaluable to the creation of the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine. In January 2002, Arakawa resigned as NoA president and was succeeded by Tatsumi Kimishima, former chief financial officer of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; subsidiary. Arakawa won a lifetime achievement award in February 2007 at the Interactive Achievement Awards.

In January 2006, Arakawa co-founded Tetris Online, Inc. with Henk Rogers and &quot;Tetris&quot; creator Alexey Pajitnov, which developed various games for Nintendo DS, Wii, iOS, and Facebook. Arakawa served as the president of Tetris Online, Inc. until March 2013. He is also an advisor to Avatar Reality.

Arakawa is played by Ken Yamamura in the 2023 movie &quot;Tetris&quot;.

<doc id="970447" wikidata="Q3087844" url="?curid=970447" title="Chern–Weil homomorphism">
<text>In mathematics, the Chern–Weil homomorphism is a basic construction in Chern–Weil theory that computes topological invariants of vector bundles and principal bundles on a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; in terms of connections and curvature representing classes in the de Rham cohomology rings of &quot;M&quot;. That is, the theory forms a bridge between the areas of algebraic topology and differential geometry. It was developed in the late 1940s by Shiing-Shen Chern and André Weil, in the wake of proofs of the generalized Gauss–Bonnet theorem. This theory was an important step in the theory of characteristic classes.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a real or complex Lie group with Lie algebra and let formula_1 denote the algebra of formula_2-valued polynomials on formula_3 (exactly the same argument works if we used formula_4 instead of Let formula_5 be the subalgebra of fixed points in formula_1 under the adjoint action of &quot;G&quot;; that is, the subalgebra consisting of all polynomials &quot;f&quot; such that formula_7, for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in formula_8,

Given a principal G-bundle &quot;P&quot; on &quot;M&quot;, there is an associated homomorphism of formula_2-algebras,
:formula_10,
called the Chern–Weil homomorphism, where on the right cohomology is de Rham cohomology. This homomorphism is obtained by taking invariant polynomials in the curvature of any connection on the given bundle. If &quot;G&quot; is either compact or semi-simple, then the cohomology ring of the classifying space for &quot;G&quot;-bundles, formula_11, is isomorphic to the algebra formula_12 of invariant polynomials:
:formula_13
(The cohomology ring of &quot;BG&quot; can still be given in the de Rham sense:
:formula_14
when formula_15 and formula_16 are manifolds.)

==Definition of the homomorphism==
Choose any connection form ω in &quot;P&quot;, and let Ω be the associated curvature form; i.e., the exterior covariant derivative of ω. If formula_17 is a homogeneous polynomial function of degree &quot;k&quot;; i.e., formula_18 for any complex number &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in then, viewing &quot;f&quot; as a symmetric multilinear functional on formula_19 (see the ring of polynomial functions), let
:formula_20
be the (scalar-valued) 2&quot;k&quot;-form on &quot;P&quot; given by
:formula_21
where &quot;v&quot;&quot;i&quot; are tangent vectors to &quot;P&quot;, formula_22 is the sign of the permutation formula_23 in the symmetric group on 2&quot;k&quot; numbers formula_24 (see Lie algebra-valued forms#Operations as well as Pfaffian).

If, moreover, &quot;f&quot; is invariant; i.e., formula_7, then one can show that formula_20 is a closed form, it descends to a unique form on &quot;M&quot; and that the de Rham cohomology class of the form is independent of formula_27. First, that formula_20 is a closed form follows from the next two lemmas:

:Lemma 1: The form formula_20 on &quot;P&quot; descends to a (unique) form formula_30 on &quot;M&quot;; i.e., there is a form on &quot;M&quot; that pulls-back to formula_20.
:Lemma 2: If a form of formula_32 on &quot;P&quot; descends to a form on &quot;M&quot;, then formula_33.

Indeed, Bianchi&#x27;s second identity says formula_34 and, since &quot;D&quot; is a graded derivation, formula_35 Finally, Lemma 1 says formula_20 satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 2.

To see Lemma 2, let formula_37 be the projection and &quot;h&quot; be the projection of formula_38 onto the horizontal subspace. Then Lemma 2 is a consequence of the fact that formula_39 (the kernel of formula_40 is precisely the vertical subspace.) As for Lemma 1, first note
:formula_41
which is because formula_42 and &quot;f&quot; is invariant. Thus, one can define formula_30 by the formula:
:formula_44
where formula_45 are any lifts of formula_46: formula_47.

Next, we show that the de Rham cohomology class of formula_30 on &quot;M&quot; is independent of a choice of connection. Let formula_49 be arbitrary connection forms on &quot;P&quot; and let formula_50 be the projection. Put
:formula_51
where &quot;t&quot; is a smooth function on formula_52 given by formula_53. Let formula_54 be the curvature forms of formula_55. Let formula_56 be the inclusions. Then formula_57 is homotopic to formula_58. Thus, formula_59 and formula_60 belong to the same de Rham cohomology class by the homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology. Finally, by naturality and by uniqueness of descending,
:formula_61
and the same for formula_62. Hence, formula_63 belong to the same cohomology class.

The construction thus gives the linear map: (cf. Lemma 1)
:formula_64
In fact, one can check that the map thus obtained:
:formula_10
is an algebra homomorphism.

== Example: Chern classes and Chern character ==
Let formula_66 and formula_67 its Lie algebra. For each &quot;x&quot; in formula_8, we can consider its characteristic polynomial in &quot;t&quot;:
:formula_69
where &quot;i&quot; is the square root of -1. Then formula_70 are invariant polynomials on formula_8, since the left-hand side of the equation is. The &quot;k&quot;-th Chern class of a smooth complex-vector bundle &quot;E&quot; of rank &quot;n&quot; on a manifold &quot;M&quot;:
:formula_72
is given as the image of formula_70 under the Chern–Weil homomorphism defined by &quot;E&quot; (or more precisely the frame bundle of &quot;E&quot;). If &quot;t&quot; = 1, then formula_74 is an invariant polynomial. The total Chern class of &quot;E&quot; is the image of this polynomial; that is,
:formula_75

Directly from the definition, one can show that formula_76 and &quot;c&quot; given above satisfy the axioms of Chern classes. For example, for the Whitney sum formula, we consider
:formula_77
where we wrote formula_78 for the curvature 2-form on &quot;M&quot; of the vector bundle &quot;E&quot; (so it is the descendent of the curvature form on the frame bundle of &quot;E&quot;). The Chern–Weil homomorphism is the same if one uses this formula_78. Now, suppose &quot;E&quot; is a direct sum of vector bundles formula_80&#x27;s and formula_81 the curvature form of formula_80 so that, in the matrix term, formula_78 is the block diagonal matrix with Ω&quot;I&quot;&#x27;s on the diagonal. Then, since we have:
:formula_84
where on the right the multiplication is that of a cohomology ring: cup product. For the normalization property, one computes the first Chern class of the complex projective line; see Chern class#Example: the complex tangent bundle of the Riemann sphere.

Since formula_85, we also have:
:formula_86

Finally, the Chern character of &quot;E&quot; is given by
:formula_87
where formula_78 is the curvature form of some connection on &quot;E&quot; (since formula_78 is nilpotent, it is a polynomial in formula_78.) Then ch is a ring homomorphism:
:formula_91
Now suppose, in some ring &quot;R&quot; containing the cohomology ring formula_92, there is the factorization of the polynomial in &quot;t&quot;:
:formula_93
where formula_94 are in &quot;R&quot; (they are sometimes called Chern roots.) Then formula_95.

== Example: Pontrjagin classes ==
If &quot;E&quot; is a smooth real vector bundle on a manifold &quot;M&quot;, then the &quot;k&quot;-th Pontrjagin class of &quot;E&quot; is given as:
:formula_96
where we wrote formula_97 for the complexification of &quot;E&quot;. Equivalently, it is the image under the Chern–Weil homomorphism of the invariant polynomial formula_98 on formula_99 given by:
:formula_100
== The homomorphism for holomorphic vector bundles ==
Let &quot;E&quot; be a holomorphic (complex-)vector bundle on a complex manifold &quot;M&quot;. The curvature form formula_78 of &quot;E&quot;, with respect to some hermitian metric, is not just a 2-form, but is in fact a (1, 1)-form (see holomorphic vector bundle#Hermitian metrics on a holomorphic vector bundle). Hence, the Chern–Weil homomorphism assumes the form: with formula_66,
:formula_103

<doc id="970454" wikidata="Q5194808" url="?curid=970454" title="Curl-up">
<text>Curl-up or Wentelteefje (original Dutch title) is a lithograph print by M. C. Escher, first printed in November 1951.

This is the only work by Escher consisting largely of text. The text, which is written in Dutch, describes an imaginary species called &quot;Pedalternorotandomovens centroculatus articulosus&quot;, also known as “wentelteefje” or “rolpens”. He says this creature came into existence because of &quot;the absence, in nature, of wheel shaped, living creatures with the ability to roll themselves forward&quot;.

The creature is elongated and armored with several keratinized joints. It has six legs, each with what appears to be a human foot. It has a disc-shaped head with a parrot-like beak and eyes on stalks on either side.

It can either crawl over a variety of terrain with its six legs or press its beak to the ground and roll into a wheel shape. It can then roll, gaining acceleration by pushing with its legs. On slopes it can tuck its legs in and roll freely. This rolling can end in one of two ways; by abruptly unrolling in motion, which leaves the creature belly-up, or by braking to a stop with its legs and slowly unrolling backwards.

The word &quot;wentelteefje&quot; is Dutch for French toast, &quot;wentel&quot; meaning &quot;to turn over&quot;. Rolpens is a dish made with chopped meat wrapped in a roll and then fried or baked. &quot;Een pens&quot; means &quot;belly&quot;, often used in the phrase beer-belly.

There is a diagonal gap through the text containing an illustration showing the step by step process of the creature rolling into a wheel. This creature appears in two more prints completed later the same month, &quot;House of Stairs&quot; and &quot;House of Stairs II&quot;.

==Translation==

The translation of the surrounding text is as follows:
The Pedalternorotandomovens Centroculatus Articulosus (curl-up) came into existence (spontaneous generation), because of the absence, in nature, of wheel shaped, living creatures with the ability to roll themselves forward. The accompanying &#x27;beastie&#x27; depiction, referred to as &#x27;revolving bitch&#x27; or &#x27;roll paunch&#x27; in laymen&#x27;s terms, subsequently anticipates the need with sensitivity. Biological details are still few: is it a mammal, a reptile, or an insect? It has a long, drawn-out, horned, sectioned body and three sets of legs; the ends of which look like the human foot. In the middle of the fat, round head, that is provided with a strong, bent parrot&#x27;s beak; they have bulb-shaped eyes, which, placed on posts, protrude far out from both sides of the head. In the stretched out position, the animal can, slowly and cautiously, with the use of his six legs, move forward over a variety of terrains (it can potentially climb or descend steep stairs, plow through bushes, or scramble over boulders). However, when it must cover a great distance, and has a relatively flat path to his disposal, he pushes his head to the ground and rolls himself up with lightning speed, at which time he pushes himself off with his legs - for as much as they can still touch the ground. In the rolled up state it exhibits the form of a discus, of which the eye posts are the central axle. By pushing off alternately with one of his three pairs of legs, he can achieve great speeds. It is also sometimes desirable during the rolling (i.e. The descent of an incline, or coasting to a finish) to hold up the legs and &#x27;freewheel&#x27; forward. Whenever it wants, it can return again to the walking position in two ways: first abruptly, by suddenly extending his body, but then it&#x27;s lying on his back with his legs in the air, and second through gradual deceleration (braking with his feet) and slowly unrolling backwards in standing position.
The original Dutch text on the litho is:

<doc id="970455" wikidata="Q3099945" url="?curid=970455" title="Howard Lincoln">
<text>Howard Charles Lincoln (born February 14, 1940) is an American lawyer and businessman, known primarily for being the former chairman of Nintendo of America and the former chairman and chief executive officer of the Seattle Mariners baseball team, representing absentee majority owner Hiroshi Yamauchi until Yamauchi died on September 19, 2013.

==Early life==
Born in Oakland, California, Lincoln was an active Boy Scout. As a thirteen-year-old boy, he posed for the famous Norman Rockwell painting &quot;The Scoutmaster&quot;, which was published in a calendar in 1956. In the painting, young Lincoln is on the immediate right of the campfire. Lincoln eventually attained the rank of Eagle Scout and received a Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.

Lincoln matriculated in 1957 at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his BA in political science in 1962 and his Juris Doctor degree from University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1965. From 1966 to 1970, he served as a lieutenant within the United States Navy Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps. He then worked in private practice as an attorney in Seattle, Washington.

== Nintendo ==
Lincoln did legal work in 1981 for Nintendo, culminating in the legal case &quot;Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.&quot;, in which Universal City Studios had sued Nintendo claiming that the video game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; infringed upon Universal City Studio&#x27;s rights to &quot;King Kong&quot;. Lincoln hired John Kirby to represent Nintendo in the courtroom. Nintendo won the case, as well as successive court appeals.

Lincoln met Yamauchi in 1982 and joined Nintendo in 1983, as its Senior Vice President and General Counsel. He and Minoru Arakawa were instrumental in rebuilding the North American video game industry (after the crash of 1983) with their highly successful marketing of the Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1994, he was appointed its chairman.

As Vice President of Nintendo, Lincoln was involved in litigation with Tengen, a subsidiary of Atari Games, about the rights to Tetris, and defended Nintendo&#x27;s use of the 10NES lock-out chip. He represented the company in the 1993 United States Senate hearings on video games, during which he promised Joe Lieberman and Herb Kohl he would not release Night Trap on a Nintendo console because it was considered inappropriate for children.

Lincoln announced his retirement from Nintendo in 1999 and departed the company in 2000

== Seattle Mariners ==
In September 1999, Lincoln became CEO of the Seattle Mariners, serving as the point man for majority investor Hiroshi Yamauchi when it came to making decisions (up until 2008, Lincoln noted that Yamauchi only pushed heavily for the team to pursue three players: Kazuhiro Sasaki, Ichiro Suzuki and Kenji Johjima); it was Lincoln that hired Pat Gillick to serve as general manager for the 2000 season. 

Lincoln&#x27;s tenure as CEO of the Seattle Mariners saw both success and controversy. Lincoln was considered instrumental, along with former senator Slade Gorton, in preserving the team&#x27;s location in Seattle and negotiating with the city for a new stadium, Safeco Field. His stewardship has seen the team&#x27;s first post-season appearances, in 1995, 1997, 2000, and 2001, as well as the aggressive expansion of the Mariners into the Japanese market, most noticeably through the acquisition of Japanese superstar Ichiro Suzuki.

Lou Piniella left after the 2002 season and Pat Gillick left the following year. Pinella once described Lincoln and Gillick prior to his departure: &quot;I like Howard personally. I enjoyed working with him. He&#x27;s a bright guy, a charming guy. But I&#x27;ll tell you this -- he&#x27;s bottom line. Howard likes total, total control. Pat wants to win. Howard just doesn&#x27;t know how.&quot; Lincoln disagreed with that remark, stating that he gave the benefit of the doubt to those he had serve as general manager. Lincoln replaced Pinella with Bob Melvin and Gillick with Bill Bavasi, with the latter being considered by Lincoln as a regret. In 2002, the first season without playoff baseball for the Mariners in years, he was quoted as saying the following about the goal set out for the team when it came to acquisitions in or out of season: &quot;You can go to the Series two ways; first, go for it regardless of the financial risk or consequences, the way Cleveland or Florida has; or go for it with a competitive team that plays for championships on a continual basis. The objective of the Seattle Mariners is not to go to the World Series regardless of the financial consequences, that is irresponsible.&quot; (this clarification arose after he had been quoted as saying the goal of the team was not to win a World Series but to be competitive every year). From 2003 to 2016, the Mariners went through nine different managers, with none of them reaching the playoffs under Lincoln (who was reported as having kept a notebook of the insults leveled at him up to 2004) as CEO.

In April of 2016, Lincoln retired as CEO, concurrent with Nintendo selling most of its stake in the team.

== Philanthropy ==
In addition to Lincoln&#x27;s business achievements, he is an active philanthropist. He has served as campaign chair for United Way of King County and the Chief Seattle Council of the Boy Scouts of America. He is also a trustee of Western Washington University.

== In popular culture ==
* Lincoln was portrayed by Ben Miles in the 2023 historical fiction film &quot;Tetris&quot;.

<doc id="970458" wikidata="Q2980154" url="?curid=970458" title="Book discussion club">
<text>A book discussion club is a group of people who meet to discuss books they have read. It is often simply called a book club, a term that may cause confusion with a book &quot;sales&quot; club. Other terms include reading group, book group, and book discussion group. Book discussion clubs may meet in private homes, libraries, bookstores, online forums, pubs, and cafés, or restaurants, sometimes over meals or drinks.

A practice also associated with book discussion, common reading program or common read, involves institutions encouraging their members to discuss select books in group settings; common reading programs are often organized by educational institutions.

==History==
Though women had formed Bible study groups since the 1600s, it wasn&#x27;t until the late 1700s that secular reading circles emerged in both America and Europe. Reading circles were not limited to particular races or classes, with one of the first reading groups for black women being formed in Lynn, Massachusetts in 1827. Throughout the 1800s, women’s reading circles expanded, with some becoming outspoken on social issues such as abolition—foreshadowing the club movement of the end of that century. Well into the 1900s, book clubs continued to serve as both an intellectual outlet and a radical political tool.

In the first half of the 20th century, women continued to be barred from many top universities. This time period was the heyday of the Book of the Month Club and the Great Books movement, both of which encouraged average Americans to take on hefty literary novels.

Women’s chief role in founding the modern book club—a consequence of being marginalized from other intellectual spaces—has gone on to influence the book industry, with women accounting for 80 percent of fiction sales. Author Toni Morrison called the 1996 launch of the Oprah&#x27;s Book Club the beginning of a &quot;reading revolution&quot;; in its first three years, books Oprah chose averaged sales of 1.4 million copies each.

Sociologist Christy Craig said that women have turned to book clubs to construct social networks and important partnerships, especially in times of upheaval.

A 2018 &quot;BookBrowse&quot; survey found that 88% of private book clubs are all-women groups, but almost half of public groups—such as those hosted by libraries—include men. The survey found that 70% of book clubs primarily read fiction, though 93% read nonfiction at least occasionally.

== Single-title clubs ==
A single-title club is one in which people discuss a particular title that every person in the group has read at the same time, often with each member buying a personal copy. Clearly, the club must somehow decide ahead of time what that title will be. Some groups may decide to choose new release titles, whilst others may choose older ones, or a mixture of the two. If it is a book discussion club that meets at a library, then each member may borrow a copy of the book from the library over a given timeframe in order for a later discussion.

There may be a few problems with these clubs. Some members may regard them as opportunities to meet people for social contact and general conversation, partially veering off onto a wide variety of non-literary topics, while others wish to engage in serious literary analysis focused on the book in question and related works, with little non-literary interaction. Additionally, some members may suggest a book not because they are interested in it from a literary point-of-view but because they think it will offer them an opportunity to make points of personal interest to them or fit an external agenda. Also, different expectations and education/skill levels may lead to conflicts and disappointments in clubs of this kind.

== Multi-title clubs ==
The characteristics of a multi-title club are such that each member may be reading different titles from each other at any given time, and they may share a reading list for a period of time. What distinguishes this from any group of unrelated people reading different things from each other is that each title is expected to be read by the next member in a serial fashion.

=== Open loans ===
Open loans suggest that the books in question are free to be loaned among the population with the expectation of getting them back eventually. Instead of one member deciding what everyone will read, with all the cost implications of acquiring that title, these clubs usually involve circulating books they already own. Each book is introduced with a short precis. This offers members the advantage of previewing a work before committing to read. It has the effect of narrowing the focus of the dialogue so that book and reader are more quickly and more accurately matched up. The sequential nature of the process implies that within a short time, three to five people may have read the same title, which is the perfect amount for a worthy conversation.

=== Catch and release ===
Catch and release imply that actual ownership of the book transfers each iteration with no expectation of the book returning to the original owner. The mechanism of transfer may include a personal face to face hand off, sending the items through the mail, or most remarkably, leaving the book in a public place with the expectation that unknown future readers will find it there. All three methods are utilized with BookCrossing. Participants use a website and a system of unique identification numbers to track released items as they migrate through a worldwide community. The interaction is largely web-centric, but it does not exclude face-to-face gatherings, each of which can take on the traits of other book discussion clubs.

==Library book clubs==
Many public libraries lead book clubs as a library program on a regular basis. A librarian usually leads a discussion after participants read the book. Copies of the book are available to be checked out for the group meeting. Some libraries at secondary schools and tertiary education institutions form book clubs. For book discussion groups outside of the facility, some libraries offer book discussion kits where several titles of a book are able to be loaned to a single patron, with a lending period typically longer than normal. The kits also contain suggested reading guides with discussion questions.

Librarians can aid in the procurement of items needed for private book club meetings. They are able to reserve multiple copies of a publication and extend loan periods. They are also able to facilitate club meetings digitally, through discussion boards or video meetings. Librarians have noted the positive influence of Google+ hangouts and Skype to host meetings for long-distance club members and for times in which not all members can attend the club. Librarians have also helped non-traditional book clubs find footing within their communities.

== Online clubs ==

Online book clubs exist in the shape of Internet forums, Yahoo Groups, e-mail mailing lists, dedicated websites, and even telephone conference calls. Also, in the category of social networks, these online clubs are made up of members of a variety of reading interests and often approach book discussion in different ways, e.g. academic discussion, pleasure-reading discussion, personal connection, and reaction to books members read.

== Author led clubs ==
In 2012, a new book club format referred to as author-led book clubs was introduced by Business Book Club &quot;12 Books.&quot; Author led book clubs include the author of the current book as part of the discussion; it often concludes the discussion with a live conference call or webinar.

== Broadcast clubs ==
A broadcast club is one in which a television, radio, or podcast show features a regular segment that presents a discussion of a book. The segment is announced in advance so that viewers or listeners may read the book prior to the broadcast discussion. Some notable broadcast book discussion clubs include:

* &quot;Oprah&#x27;s Book Club&quot;, a segment of the American television show &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; hosted by Oprah Winfrey
* &quot;Book Club of the Air&quot;, a segment of NPR&#x27;s American radio show &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; hosted by Ray Suarez
* &quot;Good Morning America Book Club&quot;, a segment of ABC&#x27;s American television show &quot;Good Morning America&quot;
* &quot;Despierta Leyendo (Wake Up Reading)&quot;, a segment of Univision&#x27;s American Spanish-language television show &quot;¡Despierta América! (Wake Up America)&quot; hosted by Jorge Ramos
* &quot;Richard &amp; Judy Book Club&quot;, a segment of Channel 4&#x27;s British television show &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; hosted by Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan
* &quot;Bookclub&quot;, a British radio show on the BBC Radio 4 station hosted by James Naughtie
* &quot;First Tuesday Book Club&quot;, an Australian television show on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation network hosted by Jennifer Byrne
* &quot;Jonny&#x27;s Book Club&quot;, a segment of the weekly podcast &quot;Gay Pimpin&#x27; with Jonny McGovern&quot; hosted by Jonny McGovern
* &quot;Chapter by Chapter&quot;, a Youtube Playlist by a Podcast host Vishwajeet M. Upadhye

== Book reading clubs ==
Given the busy lifestyles of today, another variation on the traditional &#x27;book club&#x27; is the book reading club. In such a club, the group agrees on a specific book, and each week (or whatever frequency), one person in the group reads the book out loud while the rest of the group listens. The group can either allow interruptions for comments and questions from the members at any time, or agree to allow such input at chapter or section endings. Such a club makes reading a shared experience and frees the busy members from the &quot;homework&quot; of having read the book before coming to the club. It also creates a lively environment for commenting on the specifics of the books as it is read and can lead to very enriching exchanges. A given book may continue for several sittings, depending on the pace of reading, frequency of meetings, and the extent of comments and discussion. Members can take turns reading to share the reading responsibility. Another variation on the concept could be jointly listening to an audio-book with pauses for comments. Once a book is completed, members recommend their choices of the new books and vote on which book to proceed with next.

<doc id="970459" wikidata="Q1151493" url="?curid=970459" title="Vassa">
<text>Vassa (, , both &quot;rain&quot;) is the three-month annual retreat observed by Theravada Buddhists. Taking place during the wet season, Vassa lasts for three lunar months, usually from July (the Burmese month of Waso, ) to October (the Burmese month of Thadingyut, ).

In English, Vassa is also called Rains Retreat. While Vassa is sometimes casually called &quot;Buddhist [[Lent]]&quot;, others object to this terminology.

For the duration of Vassa, monastics remain in one place, typically a monastery or temple grounds. In some monasteries, monks dedicate the Vassa to intensive meditation. Some Buddhist lay people choose to observe Vassa by adopting more ascetic practices, such as giving up meat, alcohol, or smoking. In Thailand, the sale of alcohol is prohibited on the first (&quot;Wan Khao Phansa&quot;) and last (&quot;Wan Ok Phansa&quot;) days of Vassa. Commonly, the number of years a monk has spent in monastic life is expressed by counting the number of vassas (or &quot;rains&quot;) since ordination.

Mahayana Buddhists also observe Vassa. Vietnamese Thiền and Korean Seon monastics observe an equivalent retreat of three months of intensive practice in one location, a practice also observed in Tibetan Buddhism.

Vassa begins on the first day of the waning moon of the eighth lunar month, which is the day after Asalha Puja or Asalha Uposatha (&quot;Dhamma day&quot;). It ends on Pavarana, when all monastics come before the sangha and atone for any offense that might have been committed during Vassa.

Vassa is followed by Kathina, a festival in which the laity expresses gratitude to monks. Lay Buddhists bring donations to temples, especially new robes for the monks.

The Vassa tradition predates the time of Gautama Buddha. It was a long-standing custom for mendicant ascetics in India not to travel during the rainy season as they may unintentionally harm crops, insects or even themselves during their travels. Many Buddhist ascetics live in regions which lack a rainy season. Consequently, there are places where Vassa may not be typically observed.

<text>Cindy Pickett (born April 18, 1947) is an American actress. She is known for her 1970s role as Jackie Marler-Spaulding on the CBS soap &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and Dr. Carol Novino on the television drama &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; in the 1980s. Pickett, however, is best known to audiences for her lighter turn as Katie Bueller, Ferris Bueller&#x27;s loving and unsuspecting mother, in the 1986 American comedy movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

Other notable cinematic roles and performances include Valerie St. John, the leading role in Roger Vadim&#x27;s 1980 film, &quot;Jeux de Nuit / Night Games&quot;, and the tough-as-nails and heroic Dr. Diane Norris in the 1989 sci-fi-horror film &quot;DeepStar Six&quot;.

==Life and career==
Pickett was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, daughter of Cecil Pickett, a director and drama teacher at the University of Houston.

Pickett made a major departure from her soap opera image when she played the central role in the 1980 erotic film &quot;Jeux de Nuit / Night Games&quot;, directed by Roger Vadim. It was a sexually charged role involving numerous nude scenes, however the film went unnoticed and did not boost Pickett&#x27;s career. In the 1981 mystery/crime drama &quot;Margin for Murder&quot;, Pickett played the role of Velda, Mike Hammer&#x27;s (Kevin Dobson) loyal and devoted secretary. She played &quot;Jackie Marler&quot; on the soap opera &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; from 1976 to 1980, &quot;Vanessa Sarnac&quot; on the ABC weekly TV series &quot;Call to Glory&quot; from 1984 to 1985, and she appeared as Dr. Carol Novino on the hospital drama TV series &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; from 1986 to 1988.

Pickett had a supporting role in the 1987 mini-series &quot;Amerika&quot;, which she then considered to be her &quot;best part and the best showcase&quot; she ever had. In 1991 she played the part of Addy Mathewson in the TV movie/pilot &quot;Plymouth&quot;, which at the time was considered to be one of the most expensive such movies ever made. Pickett portrayed the real-life Kay Stayner, the mother of a boy who was kidnapped for several years, in the dramatic TV movie &quot;I Know My First Name Is Steven&quot;. TV series she has guest-starred on include &quot;Riptide&quot;, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot;, &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot; and &quot;Burn Notice&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pickett dated Roger Vadim, who directed her in &quot;Night Games&quot;. She met Lyman Ward when they played the parents of the teenaged protagonist in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. They married in real life, and had two children, divorcing shortly after playing the parents of the teenaged protagonist in the 1992 film &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. Pickett is a collector of stereopticon cards.

<doc id="970471" wikidata="Q6723023" url="?curid=970471" title="Mace (spray)">
<text>Mace is the brand name of an early type of aerosol self-defense spray invented by Alan Lee Litman in the 1960s. The first commercial product of its type, Litman&#x27;s design packaged phenacyl chloride (CN) tear gas dissolved in hydrocarbon solvents into a small aerosol spray can, usable in many environments and strong enough to act as a deterrent and incapacitant when sprayed in the face.

A generic trademark, its popularity led to the name &quot;mace&quot; being commonly used for other defense sprays regardless of their composition, and for the term &quot;maced&quot; to be used to reference being pepper sprayed. It is unrelated to the spice mace.

==History==
The original formulation consisted of 1% chloroacetophenone (CN) in a solvent of 2-butanol, propylene glycol, cyclohexene, and dipropylene glycol methyl ether. Chemical Mace was originally developed in the 1960s by Allan Lee Litman and his wife, Doris Litman, after one of Doris&#x27;s female colleagues was robbed in Pittsburgh. In 1987, Chemical Mace was sold to Smith &amp; Wesson and manufactured by their Lake Erie Chemical division. Smith &amp; Wesson subsequently transferred ownership to Jon E. Goodrich along with the rest of the chemical division in what is now Mace Security International, which also owns federal trademark registrations for the term &quot;mace&quot;.

Historically, &quot;chemical mace&quot; was the development of irritant with the active ingredient called phenacyl chloride (CN) to incapacitate others whereas the term &quot;Mace&quot; is a trademarked term for use on personal defense sprays. Though the design has been expanded on, the original chemical mace formula using only CN has since been discontinued. Due to the potentially toxic nature of CN and the generally superior incapacitating qualities of oleoresin capsicum (OC) pepper spray in most situations, the early CN has been mostly supplanted by OC formulas in police use, although Mace Security International still retains a popular &quot;Triple Action&quot; formula combining CN, OC and an ultraviolet marker dye.

<text>USS &quot;Hazelwood&quot; (DD-107) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Hazelwood&quot;, named in honor of John Hazelwood, was laid down 24 December 1917 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, launched 22 June 1918 and commissioned 20 February 1919. Following shakedown and a voyage to Norfolk for supplies, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; departed New York for the Mediterranean 15 April 1919. Reaching Gibraltar 9 May, she participated in training and served as escort to &quot;Arizona&quot; (BB-39). After patrolling the Mediterranean, she departed Malta 28 July and arrived New York 13 August. Next day she got underway for her new home waters, the Pacific. Sailing via Cuba and Panama, she arrived at San Francisco 5 September. After operations along the West Coast, she decommissioned at San Diego 7 July 1922.

&quot;Hazelwood&quot; recommissioned 1 April 1925, and participated in training and readiness exercises with units of the Pacific Fleet for the next five years. She decommissioned again 15 November 1930, at San Diego, was sold to Learner and Rosenthal 30 August 1935, and was scrapped 14 April 1935.

<text>A Ramsar site is a wetland site designated to be of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, also known as &quot;The Convention on Wetlands&quot;, an international environmental treaty signed on 2 February 1971 in Ramsar, Iran, under the auspices of UNESCO. It came into force on 21 December 1975, when it was ratified by a sufficient number of nations. It provides for national action and international cooperation regarding the conservation of wetlands, and wise sustainable use of their resources. Ramsar treaty participants meet regularly to identify and agree to protect &quot;Wetlands of International Importance&quot;, especially those providing waterfowl habitat.

, there are 2,521 Ramsar sites around the world, protecting , and 172 national governments are participating.

==Site listings==
The non-profit organisation Wetlands International provides access to the Ramsar database via the Ramsar Sites Information Service. 

==Ramsar site criteria==
A wetland can be considered internationally important if any of the following nine criteria apply:

* Criterion 1: &quot;it contains a representative, rare, or unique example of a natural or near-natural wetland type found within the appropriate biogeographic region.&quot;

<doc id="970484" wikidata="Q6238436" url="?curid=970484" title="John Hazelwood">
<text>John Hazelwood (1726 – March 1, 1800) served as a Commodore in the Pennsylvania Navy and Continental Navy and was among the most noted naval officers during the American Revolutionary War. Born in England about 1726, he became a mariner and settled in Philadelphia early in life, became married and had several children. Promoted to Commodore during the Philadelphia campaign, he also became commander of Fort Mifflin while it was under siege by the British. Throughout the campaign Hazelwood and George Washington were in frequent communication with letters. 

During the weeks he spent engaging the Royal Navy on the Delaware River, Hazelwood innovated several naval tactics and played a major role in the development of riverine warfare in the United States. Recommended by Washington and his council, Hazelwood was chosen to lead a large fleet of American ships and riverboats up river to safety. For his bravery and distinguished service Congress awarded him with a ceremonial military sword, while the famous presidential artist Charles Peale found Hazelwood worthy enough to paint his portrait. After the Revolution Hazelwood lived out his remaining years in Philadelphia.

==Personal life==

In the years before the American Revolution broke out Hazelwood served as a captain on various merchant vessels, most often shipping goods between Philadelphia and London. In 1772 he became one of the founders of the Saint George society of Philadelphia. Hazelwood married his first wife, Mary Edgar, who died in 1769 at age 36. In 1771 he married the widow Ester Leacock. His first and second marriage brought him five children. His first child, Thomas, by his first wife, became a captain in the Pennsylvania Navy during the Revolution. His son, John, was a lieutenant in an artillery company serving in the Pennsylvania Western Expedition in 1794. John Jr. died in action only weeks after his father&#x27;s death in 1800 and was buried next to him. Hazelwood was a vestryman of Christ Church in Philadelphia from 1779 to 1783.

==Naval career==

A commissioned officer in the Pennsylvania Navy, Commodore Hazelwood commanded all naval vessels of the Pennsylvania and Continental navies on the Delaware River. In the years before the American Revolution he commanded a number of ships including the &quot;Susanna and Molly&quot; in 1753, the &quot;Greyhound&quot; in 1762, the &quot;Monckton&quot; in 1763, the &quot;Sally&quot; in 1771 and the &quot;Rebecca&quot; in 1774. The earliest known record of Hazelwood&#x27;s service in the American Revolutionary War is 1775. Hazelwood was appointed supervisor of building and management of fire-vessels in December, 1775, and by October 1776 was promoted to &quot;Commodore&quot; in the Pennsylvania Navy.

===Early Revolution===

During the Revolutionary War against the British Hazelwood played an important role in the planning of the various American river defenses. During the months prior to the British advance on Philadelphia he oversaw the development and construction of fire-vessels, which were used in conjunction with the many river obstructions, Cheval de frise, that were also developed for use in the Delaware River. The designs proved effective and in July, 1776, Hazelwood was immediately sent to Poughkeepsie, New York, (one among a committee of three) with orders to plan for and construct similar river obstructions to prevent British marine navigation on the upper Hudson River;

At the time Commodore John Barry was the senior navy captain in Philadelphia and the visible choice to command both the Pennsylvania and Continental navies, but command was given to Hazelwood, already in command of the Pennsylvania Navy. Hazelwood was soon promoted to &quot;Commodore&quot; of both the Pennsylvania and Continental navies in the Delaware River some time in 1777 but the exact date is not known.

Hazelwood planned for and participated in the defense of the Delaware River approach to Philadelphia in 1777 before and during the Siege of Fort Mifflin, which lasted approximately three weeks. He was soon appointed to oversee the building of and command of fire rafts, which were used to prevent passage of British ships bringing badly needed supplies to British in Philadelphia. In planning for the fort&#x27;s defense the Committee of Safety authorized the construction of war-ships, a flotilla of fire-rafts, floating batteries and the construction of river obstacles which were floated into place and sank. Construction of ten fire-rafts reached completion by December 27 where Hazelwood was appointed commander of this fleet of rafts. In the following May the Committee of Safety selected Hazelwood &quot;to survey the river from Billingsport to Fort Island and the East side across from the island.

Hazelwood was given a scouting assignment on September 19, with orders to move the American fleet to Darby Creek to observe British strength, vessels and activity at Chester. Various American rivercraft also engaged and harassed the British at various points along the river. In the process Hazelwood obtained much information about the British presence, which was copied and passed on to other commanders in the greater area.

Philadelphia finally fell on September 26 and Vice Admiral Howe and the British army entered the city, however they were low on ammunition and supply and had not established a naval supply route along the heavily defended Delaware River. In the days that followed the British began fortifying the shore surrounding the city and at the mouth of the Schuylkill River, bringing in heavy guns and supplies. During October the American fleet engaged British naval vessels and gave support to American forts along the river. Hazelwood frequently ordered galleys to deter British ships away from Billingsport. Hazelwood&#x27;s galleys kept up a disrupting fire while others patrolled the waters around Fort Mifflin. On October 9, Hazelwood&#x27;s fleet of galleys attacked the British battery at Webb Ferry. Two days later, Hazelwood landed a body of militia on Carpenter&#x27;s Island, assaulting the middle battery and capturing fifty men and two officers. A second assault on British batteries was attempted the next day but was met with heavy fire, causing the American vessels to withdraw after receiving heavy losses.

On October 22 the British launched naval assaults on positions below the fort in concert with a ground assault on Fort Mercer. In a letter of October 23, 1777, to General Washington, a fatigued Hazelwood reported that on that morning his fleet had driven the British fleet down river and forced one of its frigates ashore where the vessel accidentally exploded somehow. He reported also that his fleet was in need of reinforcements but maintained that he would not draw any men from the fort, as they were badly needed there. At this time the Marine Committee of Congress ordered Hazelwood and his second in command, Captain Charles Alexander, to take a small fleet of vessels and fire on British positions in and about Philadelphia. During the exchange of fire, the American frigate USS &quot;Delaware&quot;, commanded by Alexander, received heavy damage and was run aground where Alexander, his crew and ship were soon captured. When the tide had risen the &quot;Delaware&quot; was brought back to Philadelphia. On October 23, Hazelwood&#x27;s gunboats and galleys maintained a harassing fire on British men-of-war trying to dismantle river obstructions. In the process the British ship of the line HMS &quot;Augusta&quot;, commanded by Francis Reynolds grounded and mysteriously caught fire and blew up. The sloop of war &quot;Merlin&quot; also grounded, forcing its crew to burn the vessel. On October 27 Washington advised Hazelwood that he should send a party to the waterfront at Philadelphia at night and burn the captured &quot;Delaware&quot; but Hazelwood thought the prospect too risky and declined.

Though the capture of the &quot;Delaware&quot; was a major tactical loss, Hazelwood now realized that attacking British positions and vessels about Philadelphia with smaller vessels more suitable to river navigation was a feasible effort. During the weeks Hazelwood had engaged the British on the Delaware River he innovated and developed many naval riverine tactics and introduced the idea of small boat riverine warfare to the American navy. However, in the face of mounting British forces Hazelwood&#x27;s fleet eventually proved too small to maintain an effectual fire while maintaining a defense for forts Mifflin and Mercer.

===Siege of Fort Mifflin===

Hazelwood played a major role in the American effort in keeping British ships from reaching Philadelphia by way of the Delaware River. In the months leading up to the British siege of Fort Mifflin Washington&#x27;s headquarters at this time was located north of Philadelphia in Whitemarsh where he maintained frequent communication with Hazelwood, sending him reports, orders and advice. Fort Mifflin, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Smith, was located on an island in the middle of this river and was a key point of defense for the Americans. The fortress, along with Fort Mercer on the east bank, were the only obstacles preventing the British naval access to Philadelphia. 
Vice Admiral Howe dispatched a message to Hazelwood requesting that he surrender the Pennsylvania fleet, allowing Howe and his fleet to control the Delaware Bay, where Hazelwood was allegedly promised a pardon from the King if he cooperated. Hazelwood refused the dubious offer, declaring that he would &quot;defend the fleet to the last&quot;. 
The successful siege upon the stone and earthen fort required the prolonged bombardment by the British Navy under the command of Admiral Howe, also involving land batteries, lasting from September 26 to November 16, 1777. The standoff and defense of the fort allowed time for Washington and the Continental Army to safely deploy for the Battle of White Marsh and its subsequent withdrawal to Valley Forge. Washington received warnings from Generals Porter and Lee, stationed on the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia, that the British were making communication runs across the river at night using small boats. In a letter of November 4, Washington &quot;advised&quot; Hazelwood to do all he could to stop the activity. Hazelwood&#x27;s efforts to end the communications were less than effectual. Several days before the fall of the fort Washington dispatched another letter to Hazelwood inquiring about his status, urging that if at all possible to remain at his station with the fleet after the fort has fallen so as to hinder and prolong British operations long enough to allow the river to freeze over, preventing passage of supply ships into Philadelphia until the spring thaw.
After weeks of almost constant bombardment from British ships and batteries and receiving extensive damage and heavy casualties, Fort Mifflin was finally abandoned on November 15, while the fort&#x27;s flag was left there and remained flying. Capture of the fort was finally effected on November 16, leaving only Fort Mercer on the Red Bank of New Jersey to defend the river. Two days later, with 7,000 British troops led by General Cornwallis and with General Howe&#x27;s 1000 troops marching north to Fort Mercer, Hazelwood scuttled many of the smaller ships and galleys located there while Captain Christopher Greene and the American garrison abandoned the fort on November 20 leaving it to the advancing British. Two days later General Washington called a Council of War, meeting with several of his generals on board one of Hazelwood&#x27;s ships. During the assembly Washington&#x27;s council recommended that Commodore Hazelwood lead the effort &quot;with the first favorable wind&quot;, and get the American ships and supplies in the area safely up river just past Burlington, New Jersey. On the night of the 21st Hazelwood and the American naval fleet managed to pass by the British who were busy securing their position in Philadelphia, with no shots fired by them to stop passage of Hazelwood and the American fleet.

Soon after the fall of Forts Mifflin and Mercer Washington and other commanders sought an explanation about what led to their capture. Washington had sent General Varnum to Fort Mifflin in November to quell the frequent command disputes between garrison and naval commanders with little success. Varnum faulted himself and offered his apologies to Washington. Hazelwood and Smith, already rivals, laid the blame on each other. Exchanges between the two became increasingly heated and bitter, while each embarked on campaigns in Congress and the Pennsylvania Council for the purpose of exonerating themselves of any shortcomings, while the blaming from both continued. At one point their exchanges became so heated that Varnum and other officers had to intervene to prevent a duel.

In June 1778 the British were ordered to abandon Philadelphia and defend New York. In August The Assembly of Pennsylvania decided that a large State navy was no longer necessary and recommended that most of its ships and supplies be disbanded. During the transition Commodore Hazelwood, who was the last to hold this rank, was discharged along with a number of other officers. Widely trusted and respected in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, he was appointed &quot;Receiver of Provisions&quot; for the Pennsylvania militia.

===Later Revolution===
In February 1779, urged by the Board of War and merchants, Hazelwood was part of a committee of six defense experts chosen to survey the Delaware River, and represented the State of Pennsylvania in this effort. They were accompanied by Continental Army chief engineer Du Portail and Baron Von Steuben. Hazelwood and the defense Committee crossed the Delaware from Gloucester Point in south Philadelphia to New Jersey at Red Bank. There they embarked on horseback across Gloucester County to inspect defense works at Billingsport. From there they crossed the river to Mud island and then returned to Philadelphia with advice for General Washington as how best to defend the river.
Later that year Hazelwood became a member of a public committee chosen to meet in Philadelphia to raise money to help provide for the Army. In 1780 he became the Commissary of Purchases for the Continental Army, considered an office of great trust and responsibility over the great sums of money involved.

===Post Revolution===
On April 11, 1785, Hazelwood was selected to be one of the port wardens in Philadelphia.

==Later life==
Relatively less is known about Hazelwood&#x27;s life after the American Revolution.
The renowned patriot and artist Captain Charles Wilson Peale considered Hazelwood worthy of one of his portraits, which was later acquired by the city of Philadelphia and was hung in Independence Hall. John Hazelwood died in Philadelphia at age 74 on March 1, 1800. He was buried on March 3 in the graveyard of Saint Peter&#x27;s Church.

==Legacy==
For Hazelwood&#x27;s role in the War for Independence, the Continental Congress awarded him a handsome silver and gold enameled sword, one of only fifteen awarded during the Revolution, all swords being identical in design. Hazelwood&#x27;s sword now hangs in the collection of the Naval Historical Foundation.

USS &quot;Hazelwood&quot; (DD-107) was named in his honor.

<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;&lt;section end=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;

The 1993 Australian federal election was held to determine the members of the 37th Parliament of Australia. It was held on 13 March 1993. All 147 seats of the Australian House of Representatives and 40 seats of the 76-seat Australian Senate were up for election. The incumbent government of the centre-left Australian Labor Party led by Paul Keating, the Prime Minister of Australia, was re-elected to a fifth term, defeating the centre-right Liberal/National Coalition led by Opposition Leader John Hewson of the Liberal Party of Australia, and coalition partner Tim Fischer of the National Party of Australia. This was the first, and to date only, time the Labor Party won a fifth consecutive election. 

The result was considered an upset, as opinion polls had predicted a Coalition win. In his victory speech, Keating would famously describe the result as &quot;the sweetest victory of all&quot;. The Coalition&#x27;s loss was attributed to the unpopularity of Hewson and his economic policy, popularly known as Fightback!, with the set piece being the majorly divisive Goods and Services Tax (GST). 

This would be the last time that the Labor Party won a majority at the federal level until the 2007 election as the next four elections would produce Coalition victories. It also remains the only time that the Liberal Party was led by a leader who previously had no experience as a minister.

==Background==

This was the first election after the end of the late 80s and early 90s recession. The opposition Liberal Party was led by John Hewson, a former professor of economics at the University of New South Wales who succeeded Liberal leader Andrew Peacock in 1990. 

In November 1991 the Liberal Party launched the 650-page Fightback! policy document a radical collection of &quot;dry&quot;, economic liberal measures including: 
*the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 15%, 
*various changes to Medicare including the abolition of bulk billing for non-concession holders, 
*the introduction of a nine-month limit on unemployment benefits, 
*various changes to industrial relations including the abolition of industrial award, 
*a $13 billion personal income tax cut directed at middle and upper income earners, 
*$10 billion in government spending cuts, 
*the abolition of state payroll taxes and the privatisation of a large number of government-owned enterprises. 
All of this presented a vision of a very different future direction to the Keynesian economic conservatism practiced by previous Liberal/National Coalition governments. The 15 percent GST was the centrepiece of the policy document.

Following the December 1991 Labor leadership spill, where former Treasurer Paul Keating ousted Bob Hawke as leader of the Labor Party and subsequently Prime Minister, Keating mounted a campaign against the Fightback! package, and particularly against the GST throughout 1992. Keating described the GST as an attack on the working-class in that it shifted the tax burden from direct taxation of the wealthy to indirect taxation as a broad-based consumption tax. Pressure group activity, public opinion and Keating himself were highly critical of the GST who relentlessly led Hewson to exempt food from the proposed GST. However the exclusions announced by Hewson led to questions surrounding the complexity of what precisely which food items would and would not be exempt from the GST. Hewson&#x27;s difficulty in explaining this to the electorate was exemplified in the infamous birthday cake interview, considered by some as a turning point in the election campaign. Keating won a record fifth consecutive term for the Labor Party and a record 13 years in government at the 1993 election, a level of political success not previously seen by federal Labor. A number of the proposals were later adopted in to law in some form, to a small extent during the Keating Labor government, and to a larger extent during the John Howard Liberal government (most famously the GST, becoming law on 1 July 2000), while unemployment benefits and bulk billing were re-targeted for a time by the Tony Abbott Liberal government.

The Australian Electoral Study conducted after the election showed 70 per cent of respondents had tuned in to the Keating-Hewson televised debates, the highest ever viewership for Australian election debates. Nine Network debates saw the infamous &quot;worm&quot; being introduced for the first time to its screens during the debate. The &quot;worm&quot; wriggled along the bottom of the screen, rising and falling away on the reactions of a chosen audience. It was reported that Keating scored big-time with the worm when he savaged Hewson over his plans for a GST during the debate.

The election-eve Newspoll reported the Liberal Party and National Party Coalition on a 50.5 percent two-party-preferred vote, with Paul Keating&#x27;s personal ratings being significantly negative.

For the first time since the 1966 election, an incumbent government had increased their two-party-preferred vote.

There was an unusual circumstance in the division of Dickson (QLD). One of the candidates, an independent, died very shortly before the election, making it necessary to hold a supplementary election on 17 April. Following the return of the Labor Party to government, Keating announced the makeup of the Second Keating Ministry to be sworn in on 24 March, but kept the portfolio of Attorney-General of Australia open for Michael Lavarch subject to him winning Dickson on 17 April. He won the seat, and was appointed to the ministry on 27 April.

<doc id="970500" wikidata="Q3124136" url="?curid=970500" title="Gérard Louis-Dreyfus">
<text>Gérard C. Louis-Dreyfus (21 June 1932 – 16 September 2016), also known as William, was a French-American businessman. His net worth was estimated at $3.4 billion by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2006. He was the chairman of Louis Dreyfus Energy Services and the great-grandson of Léopold Louis-Dreyfus, founder of Louis Dreyfus Group. He was the father of actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

== Life and career ==
Louis-Dreyfus was born in Paris in 1932. His great-grandfather Léopold Louis-Dreyfus founded the Louis Dreyfus Group in 1851. His mother, Dolores Porges (née Neubauer; 1905–1987), was American-born, the daughter of a Brazilian father and a Mexican mother. His father, Pierre Louis-Dreyfus (1908–2011), was a Frenchman who headed the Louis Dreyfus group. Pierre, who was Jewish, fought in the French Resistance during World War II; his mother was Catholic. He has one sister, Dominique Cornwell.

Another cousin is Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the former chief executive officer of Adidas and ex-Chairman of French football club Olympique de Marseille.

In 1940, Louis-Dreyfus moved to the United States with his mother after her divorce from Pierre. By 1945, he had adopted the name William as a symbol of his integration into American society.

After graduating from Duke University and Duke University School of Law, Louis-Dreyfus worked at the law firm of Dewey Ballantine, New York, before joining Louis Dreyfus in 1965. He was chairman of the Poetry Society of America from 1998 to 2008. He had poems published in publications such as &quot;The Hudson Review&quot;.

== Politics ==
In October 2012, Dreyfus published a full-page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;A Call To Arms To The Wealthy To Protect The Right To Vote&quot; encouraging wealthy people in the United States to fight voter suppression. Dreyfus himself donated $1 million.

== Personal life ==
Louis-Dreyfus was married twice. In 1955 he married Judith LeFever. They had one daughter, actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus (b. January 1961) before divorcing in 1962. In 1965, he married Phyllis Blankenship; they had two daughters, both social workers: Phoebe Émilie Dominique Louis-Dreyfus Eavis (b. May 1968) and Emma R. Louis-Dreyfus (b. 16 June 1974; died on 13 August 2018). In 1996, Phoebe married English financial journalist Peter Eavis at St. Matthew&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Bedford, New York. He also had a son, Raphael Penteado.

== Death ==
Louis-Dreyfus died at his home in Mount Kisco, New York on 16 September 2016 at the age of 84. His daughter Julia dedicated her 2016 Emmy win to her late father.

<text>The Mollusk is the sixth studio album by American rock band Ween, released by Elektra Records on June 24, 1997. It is a multi-genre concept album with a dark nautical theme, with several songs incorporating elements from psychedelia and/or sea shanties, while also featuring a heavy progressive rock influence. Dean Ween described the album as &quot;the only record that I ever felt really confident about&quot; and &quot;my favorite record we&#x27;ve ever done&quot;. Gene Ween has echoed this sentiment, saying: &quot;&quot;The Mollusk&quot; is probably my favorite, at the end of the day&quot;.

==Background==
Starting with the release of their 1994 album &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;, Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo—known by their stage names Gene and Dean Ween, respectively—began to significantly enhance their approach to studio recording. While their earlier albums were almost entirely recorded by Freeman and Melchiondo themselves at their home using a 4-track recorder, &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; marked the first time the band produced an album in a professional recording studio. It also notably began their transition from a duo to a more traditional band with the addition of drummer Claude Coleman, allowing Freeman and Melchiondo to experiment with a wider range of musical styles than they could with the drum machine they had used on previous releases.

Though Ween&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot; was their first record to feature a full-fledged band on each track, the songs were recorded with various Nashville session musicians, so it was viewed by the band as more of a spin-off album, in the vein of &quot;The Beach Boys&#x27; Christmas Album&quot;, than a true follow-up to &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;. &quot;The Mollusk&quot; was the debut album for keyboardist Glenn McClelland, and, with bassist Dave Dreiwitz joining shortly before the album’s release, the band finally evolved into the final five-man incarnation that continues to this day.

The cover art for &quot;The Mollusk&quot; was created by Storm Thorgerson, the graphic designer who designed many of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album covers, including &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Thorgerson liked the album so much that, although he was only hired to do the cover art, he decided to do the related promo and poster art, including all of the initial print ads associated with &quot;The Mollusk&quot;, for no extra charge.

==Recording==
After recording 1994&#x27;s &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot; in a professional studio, Gene and Dean Ween decided they wanted to return to their early method of recording albums at home. In 1995, they relocated their recording equipment to a rented beach house on the shore of Holgate, New Jersey, and the equipment and some of the early materials for the album were nearly lost when a water pipe burst in the house while it was unoccupied. At this point, the band put this album on hold and made plans to record 1996&#x27;s &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot; in Nashville. After recording &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot; in 1995 and releasing and touring behind it, Ween completed the remaining tracking of &quot;The Mollusk&quot; at various inland locations. The album was finished in 1996 and released on June 24, 1997.

==Music==
AllMusic labelled it as being another &quot;multi-genre extravaganza&quot; like &quot;Chocolate and Cheese&quot;, in contrast to &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot;, which focused on a single genre. The album draws from celtic rock, country, cowpunk, electronica, 17th century folk music, jazz, new wave, progressive rock, psychedelia, punk, soft rock, symphonic rock, show tunes and vaudeville. At the time, the album&#x27;s overall sound was described as &quot;gay sea shanties&quot;.

The opening track &quot;I&#x27;m Dancing in the Show Tonight&quot; incorporates elements from vaudeville and show tunes. In a July 2017 interview for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Dean Ween said that the music from the song came from an old ballet practice record his sister had. The band recorded the song shortly after meeting Glenn McClelland, and had his two year old son Charlie sing on the song. According to Dean Ween, &quot;everybody sang on the song&quot;, and there were 11 other vocal tracks mixed in with Charlie McClelland&#x27;s voice, which was the most prominent one on the song. The vocal tracks were all at different speeds, which Dean Ween said &quot;[made it sound] really fucked up&quot;. Some incorrectly believed that the high pitched vocals were simply achieved through pitch shifting Dean Ween&#x27;s voice. 

&quot;Pink Eye (On My Leg)&quot; is a jazz and psychedelic tinged instrumental which has sound clips of a dog barking. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Johnny on the Spot&quot; is a fast punk influenced track. The lyrics are about the phrase itself &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Johnny on the Spot&quot;, which is used to mean someone you can rely on to pull through for you. It debuted live while the band were on tour for &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot;, and this early live version had country instrumentation rather than distorted punk instrumentation. &quot;Buckingham Green&quot; incorporates symphonic rock elements, and the song&#x27;s title may have been a reference to a shopping center called &quot;Buckingham Green&quot;, which is located near the band&#x27;s hometown of New Hope, Pennsylvania. &quot;The Blarney Stone&quot; incorporates sea shanty and celtic rock elements, and like &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Johnny on the Spot&quot;, had earlier been performed live with country instrumentation. It is lyrically about a tattoo artist friend of the band named Joe Rose. &quot;Waving My Dick in the Wind&quot; is a country/cowpunk song, and the most country-influenced track on &quot;The Mollusk&quot;, with the band having originally considered recording it with the Nashville musicians for &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot;. It has been described as a &quot;leftover country tune&quot;. &quot;Cold Blows the Wind&quot; was inspired from an old book of 17th century folk songs that Gene Ween had. &quot;She Wanted to Leave&quot; has been called an homage/parody of the British progressive rock band The Moody Blues.

&quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be (Alright)&quot; is a soft rock ballad with subtle electronic elements, and has lyrics inspired by a breakup Gene Ween was going through. When it was written, he was feeling depressed and didn&#x27;t have his head in the right mindset to make music, so Dean Ween cheered him up by taking him for a night of gambling at Atlantic City. The band ended up winning money while gambling and spent it at a steakhouse. The song has rarely been performed live by the band, only being played a few times on the subsequent tour for &quot;The Mollusk&quot;.

==Reception==

Sara Scribner of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described &quot;The Mollusk&quot; as a &quot;poppier, less fractured album&quot; in 1997. Rob Brunner of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a C on June 27, 1997. He considered it a return to the band&#x27;s previous sound, and critiqued its &quot;juvenility&quot;. He said, &quot;after a strange detour with the flippant &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot;, this alt-rock comedy act returns to past albums’ suburban-stoners-with-a-tape-deck silliness with &quot;The Mollusk&quot;.&quot; In her July 1, 1997 review, Lynn Gellar of &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine wrote that Ween were equivalent to meeting a man at a party who was &quot;willing to do anything for a laugh.&quot; She added that, &quot;the fact that they’re great musicians capable of jumping genres every album is just icing on a sardonic cake.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; included the album on their list of the 50 best albums from 1997. Newsweek named The Mollusk as the 14th best album of 1997.

==Impact==
&quot;The Mollusk&quot; was a direct influence on the animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Stephen Hillenburg, the show&#x27;s creator, contacted the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release, and he requested a song from them which later became &quot;Loop de Loop&quot;. The track &quot;Ocean Man&quot; is played during the end credits of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;.

Kurt Vile named &quot;Mutilated Lips&quot; his favorite song of all time, and recalled that the album &quot;blew [his] mind&quot; when he listened to it as a teenager.

==Track listing==
Notes
* &quot;I&#x27;m Dancing in the Show Tonight&quot; is a re-working of the 1953 Christmas song, &quot;Are My Ears on Straight?&quot;.
* &quot;Cold Blows the Wind&quot; is a reworking of the traditional English folk song &quot;The Unquiet Grave&quot;.
* &quot;She Wanted to Leave&quot; ends at 2:25; a slow instrumental reprise of &quot;I&#x27;m Dancing in the Show Tonight&quot; accompanied by wind noises plays after 7 seconds of silence.

==The Mollusk Sessions==

In 2007, Ween released The Mollusk Sessions, which contains demo versions of the album&#x27;s tracks as well as some cut tracks. Some of these cut tracks would end up being featured on future albums: Flutes of The Chi would end up on the following record White Pepper, and Did You See Me would later be included on the B-sides compilation Shinola, Vol. 1.

<text>The Carpet People is a comic fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. First published in 1971 and written when Pratchett was 17 years old, it was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author&#x27;s Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: &quot;This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.&quot;

&quot;The Carpet People&quot; contains a similar mix of humour and serious topics like war, death and religion, which later became a major part of the Discworld series. Before creating the Discworld, Pratchett wrote about two different flat worlds, first in this novel, and then in the novel &quot;Strata&quot;.

==Characters==

*Glurk, chief of the Munrungs
*Snibril, Glurk&#x27;s younger brother
*Pismire, the wise man of the Munrung tribe
*Bane, a Dumii general
*Brocando, King of the Deftmenes
*Fray, a natural phenomenon wreaking havoc on the Carpet
*Mouls, a power-hungry species
*Wights, who remember the future
*Camus Cadmes

==Themes==
The book explores the conflict between traditions and innovation. There is an established civilization, complete with bureaucrats, taxation, and permits; there are people who resent the establishment; there is a need for both groups to find common ground in order to save their collective civilization.

<text>Anne Bishop is an American fantasy writer. Her most noted work is the Black Jewels series. She won the Crawford Award in 2000 for the first three Black Jewels books, sometimes called the Black Jewels trilogy: &quot;Daughter of the Blood&quot;, &quot;Heir to the Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Queen of the Darkness&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in 1955, Anne Bishop started her writing career by publishing short stories. She is best known for her award-winning novels, The Black Jewels Trilogy, &quot;Daughter of the Blood&quot;, &quot;Heir to the Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Queen of the Darkness&quot;. Bishop has also created The Tir Alainn Trilogy, and The Landscapes of Ephemera Series. She is currently residing in upstate New York working on The Others, her newest series. Many of her novels are also available internationally.

She lives in upstate New York.

==Works==

===Series===
Speculative fiction series constitute most of Bishop&#x27;s published work.

;Black Jewels

The first volume of the original trilogy, and first novel set in the Black Jewels universe, &quot;Daughter of the Blood&quot;, was published in March 1998. &quot;Heir to the Shadows&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Darkness&quot;, published in April 1999 and January 2000, completed the trilogy. An omnibus edition was released in 2003. Also in 2000, Bishop released her first stand alone novel for the Black Jewels universe, &quot;The Invisible Ring&quot;. Taking place prior to the trilogy itself, readers were able to pick up the novel either before or after reading the trilogy, though Bishop recommends reading it after. In 2005, Bishop then released the book of four short stories known as &quot;Dreams Made Flesh&quot;. Once again, this collection of short stories allowed a reader to taste the rich universe Bishop had created without needing to have read the core trilogy. Although, reading the trilogy added to the depth of the individual short stories and vice versa. 2008 brought about another stand-alone novel, &quot;Tangled Webs&quot;. Then in 2009, Bishop&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shadow Queen&quot; was published and here she did something a little different. Unlike her prior releases, this novel was related to characters and events which occurred during another of her stand-alone novels, &quot;The Invisible Ring&quot; as well as the events of the original trilogy. &quot;Shalador&#x27;s Lady&quot;, released in 2010, is the sequel to &quot;The Shadow Queen&quot; and in March 2011, &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Dawn&quot; hit the shelves. It contains four more short stories which help to answer some questions reader&#x27;s had about different parts of the universe/story. Two short stories, &quot;By the Time the Witchblood Blooms&quot; and &quot;The Price&quot; were originally published (March 2000 and October 2004 respectively) in anthologies of short stories from a variety of authors. &quot;By the Time the Witchblood Blooms&quot; can also be found at the end of &quot;Tangled Webs&quot;.

In publication order the titles are: 
*&quot;Daughter of the Blood&quot;, March 1998
*&quot;Heir to the Shadows&quot;, April 1999
*&quot;Queen of the Darkness&quot;, January 2000

<doc id="970517" wikidata="Q282121" url="?curid=970517" title="Yoshiyuki Sadamoto">
<text>is a Japanese character designer, manga artist, and one of the founding members of the Gainax anime studio.

==Career==

When Gainax was originally founded as Daicon Film, Sadamoto served as animator on the second animated project, the Daicon IV opening animation. His first assignment as a character designer for Gainax was the film &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise&quot;, released in 1987, he continued to design characters for Gainax with the series &quot;&quot;, &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, &quot;FLCL&quot;, and &quot;Diebuster&quot;. The official manga adaptation of Evangelion, published between 1994 and 2013, was fully written and illustrated by Sadamoto. He also collaborated with director Mamoru Hosoda to provide character designs for the films &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot;, &quot;Summer Wars&quot;, and &quot;Wolf Children&quot;.

According to Yasuo Otsuka, who guided Sadamoto as a newcomer, there are only three people whom he regarded as more skillful than himself that he has met during his career. One of them is Yoshiyuki Sadamoto. The other two are Sadao Tsukioka who became a visual creator, and award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki. When Otsuka met the three men, he seems to have felt that he was taking off his hat to them at once. However, he thinks that only Miyazaki completely mastered a genuinely superior animation technique at present. He guesses, &quot;A too excellent person might despair in the group work&quot;.

In a 2013 interview with Japanese Entertainment website Nihongogo, it was revealed that Sadamoto is a stickler for details and wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable illustrating anything too unfamiliar to him. &quot;In general, I don’t want to draw something that I have to study further in order to draw. For example, I could not draw a medical manga because it’s impossible for me to make a lie about medicine. Also things like Soccer and Baseball. I am unfamiliar with these worlds so it would be too difficult to show the actual plays.&quot; When asked about dream collaborations he revealed an interest in working with Robert Westall and Philip K. Dick but apologized &quot;These are all deceased people, sorry.&quot;

===Criticism===
On August 9, 2019, Sadamoto criticized on Twitter a statue featured in the “After ‘Freedom of Expression’?” historical art exhibition at the Aichi Prefecture Museum of Art, &quot;Statue of Peace&quot; (2011), by Kim Seo-kyung and Kim Eun-sang memorializing comfort women, girls who worked in wartime brothels in World War II for the Japanese military. The statue was first installed by its creators in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul as a form of political protest. He also criticized a movie in the exhibition that showed a picture of the Emperor of Japan being burned and then stomped underfoot, he referred to it as &quot;indistinguishable from a certain country&#x27;s style of propaganda&quot;. Sadamoto said &quot;I wanted it to be an art event with academic contemporary art at its core...Remove the crazy [propaganda]-affirming media and the exhibition could still be redeemed.&quot; he follows &quot;I&#x27;m not going to completely reject the act of turning propaganda into art, but honestly speaking, it did not speak to me at all on an artistic level.&quot; His comments have been criticized by some Koreans and English speakers who replied to his tweet with displeasure of his views. 

Later, Sadamoto claimed he merely disliked the statue&#x27;s design, but liked Korean idols and even had Korean friends. According to Gainax co-founder Toshio Okada, Sadamoto&#x27;s feelings towards Koreans were already a factor of animosity during the production of &quot;Nadia&quot;, during which he blamed outsourced Korean animators for oscillations of quality during the series&#x27; &quot;Island Arc&quot; and would go on angry tirades disparaging their work, leaving the studio on his motorcycle. Anno believed this was part of miscommunication in the production process, and Okada attributed it to cultural differences.

After &quot;3.0&quot;, Sadamoto did not return to work on the final &quot;Rebuild&quot; movie, &quot;&quot;, and has had a diminishing role in the tetralogy. Character design, as well as authorship for the spin-off manga &quot;Evangelion 3.0 (-120 min.)&quot;, was instead handed to Hidenori Matsubara for most of the &quot;Rebuilds&quot;, with Sadamoto being credited instead as &quot;original character design&quot; in &quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;3.0&quot; and &quot;3.0+1.0,&quot; with diminishing involvement in a supervisory role for &quot;2.0&quot; and &quot;3.0&quot;. He was also not interviewed for the last two films. Many fans, primarily Korean ones, protested at Sadamoto&#x27;s statements, and asked if he was still involved with the new &quot;Eva&quot; movie. Sadamoto denied this and stated he had completely resigned from Khara and had &quot;no involvement whatsoever&quot;.

Yang Guo traces his lineage to Yang Zaixing, a Song general who participated in the Jin–Song Wars against the Jin Empire. His father, Yang Kang, is the antagonist in &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; and was notorious for committing several atrocities. His mother, Mu Nianci, was Yang Kang&#x27;s lover. She left Yang Kang after seeing how unrepentant and incorrigible he was, but was already pregnant with Yang Guo at the time.

Yang Guo&#x27;s birth is briefly mentioned at the end of the first novel. Mu Nianci met Guo Jing and Huang Rong shortly after giving birth to her son. Guo Jing, who was Yang Kang&#x27;s sworn brother, hoped that Yang Kang&#x27;s child will not follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps. He named the baby boy &quot;Guo&quot;, which means &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;fault&quot;, and gave him the courtesy name &quot;Gaizhi&quot;, which means &quot;to correct&quot;. Guo Jing hopes that Yang Guo would redeem the Yang family&#x27;s name, which has been tarnished by Yang Kang&#x27;s villainy. He also promises Mu Nianci that he will teach Yang Guo martial arts when the boy becomes older.

==Early life==
Yang Guo became an orphan at the age of 11 after his mother died. His mother taught him some of the skills she learnt from his grandfather, Yang Tiexin, and the Beggars&#x27; Gang&#x27;s former chief, Hong Qigong. He roams the &quot;jianghu&quot; after his mother&#x27;s death and meets Guo Jing and Huang Rong by coincidence. They recognise him as the son of Yang Kang and Mu Nianci after seeing that he resembles his parents. Their suspicions are confirmed when Yang Guo demonstrates some combat skills that only Mu Nianci knew. The Guo couple then take him under their care. Huang Rong is initially suspicious of Yang Guo as she sees that he bears an uncanny resemblance to his father and worries that he will turn out to be like his father. She strongly opposes her husband&#x27;s decision to instruct Yang Guo in martial arts and only teaches him literary arts such as poetry and Confucian classics.

Guo Jing brings Yang Guo to the Quanzhen School on Mount Zhongnan for better guidance and tutelage in orthodox martial arts and moral ethics. In an earlier misunderstanding, Guo Jing fought and defeated several Quanzhen students, who mistook him for an enemy. After Guo Jing left, the Quanzhen students vent their frustration on Yang Guo by picking on him and bullying him all the time. Yang Guo&#x27;s martial arts teacher, Zhao Zhijing, is prejudiced against him and does not teach him any practical martial arts. Yang Guo is unable to stand the ill treatment so he flees from Quanzhen after injuring one of the bullies.

Yang Guo ventures into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead and meets Xiaolongnü and Granny Sun. Xiaolongnü refuses to let him stay in the tomb and asks Granny Sun to send him back to Quanzhen. Granny Sun dotes on the boy and defends him from the bullies. The scuffle gradually escalates into a fight between Granny Sun and the Quanzhen School. Hao Datong, one of the &quot;Seven Immortals of Quanzhen&quot;, accidentally kills Granny Sun during the fight. At this critical moment, Xiaolongnü shows up and rescues Yang Guo.

==Love relationship with Xiaolongnü==
Yang Guo joins the Ancient Tomb School as Xiaolongnü&#x27;s apprentice and they live together in the Ancient Tomb for many years. During this time, they develop a romantic relationship, rendering their master-apprentice relationship merely superficial. Yang Guo meets Guo Jing and Huang Rong later and they immediately oppose his decision to marry Xiaolongnü. A romantic relationship between master and apprentice is regarded as highly taboo according to the prevailing norms of the &quot;wulin&quot; (martial artists&#x27; community). Yang Guo&#x27;s impulsive personality and lack of respect for other senior martial artists, compounded by the rebellious streak in him, makes the situation worse. He then leaves with Xiaolongnü.

Yang Guo becomes an outcast of the &quot;wulin&quot; and is despised by fellow martial artists. However, he saves Guo Jing&#x27;s family from danger on different occasions as he still respects the Guo couple as his surrogate uncle and aunt. He is briefly separated from Xiaolongnü numerous times throughout the novel, usually over misunderstandings but they are always reunited again later.

==From rebellious youth to legendary hero==
Throughout the novel, Yang Guo encounters several elite martial artists, including Huang Yaoshi, Ouyang Feng and Hong Qigong, who teach him some of their skills. He employs the skills he mastered to his advantage and uses them for greater purposes as he gradually matures. He creates a new palm technique called &#x27;Melancholic Palms&#x27;, an extremely powerful skill incorporating elements of all the skills he learnt earlier.

Yang Guo initially suspects that Guo Jing and Huang Rong are responsible for his father&#x27;s death. He meets Jinlun Guoshi and agrees to help the Mongols kill Guo Jing. However, he becomes so impressed with Guo Jing&#x27;s loyalty and strong sense of chivalry that he refrains from killing Guo Jing on a few occasions when he had a chance to. Because of a misunderstanding, Guo Jing&#x27;s daughter, Guo Fu cuts off his right arm with a sword in a heated quarrel. Yang Guo later hides in a cave, along with the Condor (a large god bird that can carry people, this bird knows martial arts and understands human language) practicing martial arts. Then, with the Condor, he saved many people in trouble and was honored as the Condor Hero. 

He eventually gives up his desire to avenge his father after hearing about his father&#x27;s villainy and misdeeds. Yang Guo still maintains filial piety for his father despite his shame, knowing it would be hypocritical for him to hate his father on account of his past temptations for revenge that nearly led him to the path of villainy. He replaces the original headstone (inscribed by Qiu Chuji) on his father&#x27;s grave, with a new one bearing the words: &quot;Yang Kang, my late father. Erected by his unworthy son, Yang Guo,&quot; and seeks to atone his father&#x27;s crimes. He takes Guo Jing&#x27;s side and participates in defending the city of Xiangyang from Mongol invaders. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Xiaolongnü, temporarily halts the Mongol invasion by slaying Möngke Khan, and becomes a legendary hero, finally redeemed his family&#x27;s name.

In the sequel &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot;, it is implied that, prior to Xiangyang&#x27;s falls to Kublai Khan&#x27;s army, Yang Guo met with the Guo Family and provided them Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s Heavy Iron Sword and the Ancient Tomb Sect&#x27;s Lady Sword to forge two weapons: the Heaven Sword and the Dragon Saber. His descendants are charged to oversee Huang Rong&#x27;s plans and seeking a worthy successor to inherit Guo Jing&#x27;s heroic path as China&#x27;s protector and formidable skills.

==Martial arts and skills==
At the end of the novel, Yang Guo becomes the most powerful martial artist of his time and is compared favourably to the &quot;Five Greats&quot; of the era, who are older and more experienced than him by a considerable margin. His martial arts are an eclectic mix of the numerous skills he gains under the tutelage of several legendary masters. At the end of the novel, Huang Rong names Yang Guo the &quot;Western Passionate&quot; of the new generation of the &quot;Five Greats&quot;, replacing his deceased godfather, &quot;Western Venom&quot; Ouyang Feng.

===Mu Nianci===
Yang Guo&#x27;s mother, Mu Nianci, taught him some of the martial arts she learnt from Yang Tiexin and Hong Qigong. However, due to his young age and his mother&#x27;s demise, Yang Guo was unable to fully master those skills nor utilise them in combat until he meets Hong at Mount Hua years later. When he first met Guo Jing and Huang Rong, the latter managed to deduce that he is the son of Yang Kang and Mu Nianci by observing his movements because of them had also learned from Hong.

===Ouyang Feng===
At the beginning of the story, Yang Guo encounters the insane Ouyang Feng, who likes him and accepts him as a godson. Ouyang Feng was a gifted but vicious Kung Fu practitioner and one of the older generation of the &quot;Five Greats&quot;. In the Legend of the Condor Heroes, he became crazy after learning from a fake martial arts manual which limited his potential. He is still very strong though but can never go back to his old form.
Ouyang Feng teaches Yang Guo the Toad Skill (). Yang Guo used this skill once in his childhood on the Wu brothers when he was bullied by them and he injured Wu Xiuwen. He uses the skill again when he is bullied in Quanzhen School and knocks out one of the bullies Lu Qingdu. He meets his godfather for the last time when the latter is fighting with Hong Qigong. Ouyang Feng teaches him the Serpent Staff techniques before his death.

===Quanzhen School===
In Quanzhen, Yang Guo becomes an apprentice of Zhao Zhijing, one of the apprentices of one of the senior members of the &quot;Seven Immortals&quot;. However, Zhao holds a grudge against Guo Jing after the latter defeated him in an earlier misunderstanding. Zhao Zhijing then vents his frustration on Yang Guo after Guo Jing left. He is determined not to instruct Yang Guo in practical martial arts and merely teaches him the literary and verbal forms to disguise his neglect. Yang Guo is able to recite the verses smoothly but has not been taught how to apply them in actual combat.

Yang Guo only learnt how to apply those verses in martial arts after he joined the Ancient Tomb School. He uses the verses to help himself and Xiaolongnü master the Swordplay of Jade Maiden.

===Ancient Tomb School===
While in the Ancient Tomb, Yang Guo learnt the school&#x27;s martial arts from Xiaolongnü. Some of the skills are listed as follows:

* Ancient Tomb School &quot;qinggong&quot; ()
* Fist of Beauties ()
* Palm of Infinity Web ()
* Swordplay of Jade Maiden (), based on the &quot;Jade Maiden Heart Sutra&quot; ()

===Five Poisons Secret Manual===
Yang Guo was saved by Cheng Ying after he was injured in a fight against Jinlun Guoshi. Cheng Ying brings him to a secluded hut in a mountainous area to recuperate. On the same night, Li Mochou comes to kill Cheng Ying and her cousin Lu Wushuang. Lu Wushuang passes Yang Guo the &quot;Five Poisons Secret Manual&quot; (), which she stole from Li Mochou, and tells him to memorise the book before destroying it.

===Nine Yin Manual===
In an early chapter, Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü were fleeing from Li Mochou when they stumble upon a secret chamber in the Ancient Tomb. They discover carvings of the &quot;Nine Yin Manual&quot; on the stone walls and practise them. Although Yang Guo does not manage to fully master all the skills in the manual, he integrates the fragmentary knowledge he gained from those carvings into his own martial arts and his prowess improves tremendously.

The manual is also a legacy of Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü. In &quot;The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber&quot;, the Yellow Dress Maiden defeats Zhou Zhiruo&#x27;s evil Nine Yin White Bone Claw (an unconventional skill derived from the manual) with an orthodox version of the Claw. Her family name is briefly mentioned to be &quot;Yang&quot; and she hints to Zhang Wuji that she is a descendant of the Condor Hero Couple (Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü), by saying: &quot;Behind Mount Zhongnan in the Tomb of the Living Dead, the Condor Hero Couple disappear from the &quot;jianghu&quot;&quot;.

===Hong Qigong===
Yang Guo meets Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng on Mount Hua. Hong Qigong and Ouyang Feng have been rivals for a long time and they fight again on the summit. Neither emerges the victor after several rounds of fighting. After many days, both of them are physically weakened after pitting their inner energy against each other. Both of them thought of new techniques to counter each other&#x27;s moves but fatigue prevents them from doing so. Yang Guo has been an observer throughout this time and they decide to use him as an intermediary, performing each technique for the other to see. He learns the Dog Beating Staff Technique () from Hong Qigong. Yang Guo uses this skill during a duel against the Mongols, surprising Huang Rong and Guo Jing. Huang Rong was curious but Guo Jing was nothing but ecstatic for Yang Guo.

===Huang Yaoshi===
Yang Guo meets Huang Yaoshi once while he is escaping from Li Mochou together with Lu Wushuang and Cheng Ying. Huang Yaoshi helps them defeat and drive away Li Mochou, and then chats with Yang Guo. Huang Yaoshi likes Yang Guo because of their similar disdain for rules and customs, and teaches him the Finger Flicking Skill () and Jade Flute Swordplay (). Huang Yaoshi also teaches Yang Guo how to utilise his inner energy to its full potential.

===Dugu Qiubai===
In a dramatic twist of events, Guo Jing&#x27;s daughter Guo Fu attacks Yang Guo in a heated argument and slices off his right arm with a sword. Yang Guo is weakened and delirious from losing too much blood, but manages to stagger away and is later saved by the Condor. The Condor was once a companion of Dugu Qiubai, a great swordsman who lived long ago and whose skills were unparalleled in his time.

The Condor helps Yang Guo recover from his wound and leads him to the items left behind by Dugu Qiubai. Yang Guo inherits Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s Heavy Iron Sword () and learns Dugu&#x27;s swordplay techniques from the Condor. Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s swordplay skills are advantageous to the handicapped Yang Guo as they focus on great strength rather than fancy moves, thereby Guo Fu inadvertently helped him fulfill its practices&#x27; prerequisite. Yang Guo trains with the Condor in the rain which dramatically improves his inner energy to fit the heavy sword. He overcomes his disability to wield the Heavy Iron Sword with one arm and also he had been consuming snake gallbladders every day for over a month. His inner energy at this point was near its peak and could easily rival anyone in wulin from this point.

Yang Guo confronts Jinlun Guoshi, Da&#x27;erba and Huodu on Mount Zhongnan later and defeats them easily with the Heavy Iron Sword. After his separation from Xiaolongnü again, he returns to join the Condor and continues with his training for another seven years tremendously improving his swordsmanship to the point where he is stronger without a weapon than with a weapon. He had nearly learned all of Dugu Qiubai&#x27;s swordplay (everything that was written inside the cave) although no one knew if there were more to it.

===Melancholic Palms===
Yang Guo&#x27;s agony and misery from being separated from Xiaolongnü spurs him to create a new set of palm techniques, known as the &#x27;Melancholic Palms&#x27; (), which incorporates elements of all the martial arts he learnt in his whole life. Its movements are based on Yang Guo&#x27;s emotions and despite its designation as a palm technique, incorporates the use of the full body.

Yang Guo spars with Huang Yaoshi and Zhou Botong with his new skill and they are impressed. Huang Yaoshi remarked that Yang Guo&#x27;s new palm techniques can rival Guo Jing&#x27;s Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

==In film and television==
Notable actors who have portrayed Yang Guo in films and television series include Patrick Tse (1960), Alexander Fu (1982), Leslie Cheung (1983), Andy Lau (1983), Louis Koo (1995), Christopher Lee (1998), Richie Ren (1998), Huang Xiaoming (2006) and Chen Xiao (2014).

<doc id="970536" wikidata="Q745233" url="?curid=970536" title="Peter Saville (graphic designer)">
<text>Peter Andrew Saville (born 9 October 1955) is an English art director and graphic designer. He designed many record sleeves for Factory Records, which he co-founded in 1978 alongside Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus.

==Early life==

Peter Saville was born in Manchester, Lancashire, and attended St Ambrose College. He studied graphic design at Manchester Polytechnic from 1975 to 1978.

Saville became involved in the music scene after meeting Tony Wilson, the journalist and broadcaster. The meeting resulted in Wilson commissioning the first Factory poster (FAC 1). Saville was a partner in Factory Records along with Wilson, Martin Hannett, Rob Gretton and Alan Erasmus.

==Factory Records==
Peter Saville designed many record sleeves for Factory artists, most notably for Joy Division and New Order.

Influenced by fellow student Malcolm Garrett, who had begun designing for the Manchester punk group Buzzcocks, and by Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Pioneers of Modern Typography&quot;, Saville was inspired by Jan Tschichold, chief propagandist for the New Typography. According to Saville: &quot;Malcolm had a copy of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Pioneers of Modern Typography&quot;. The one chapter that he hadn&#x27;t reinterpreted in his own work was the cool, disciplined &#x27;New Typography&#x27; of Tschichold and its subtlety appealed to me. I found a parallel in it for the New Wave that was evolving out of Punk.&quot;

Saville collaborated with Ben Kelly on numerous projects during this period. Saville credited Kelly as a major influence on his work, saying &quot;I thought I could just take things from Ben, like he was a reference book or something. He used to get really mad about it.&quot; Kelly and Saville won a Designers and Art Directors Award for the sleeve of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s 1980 self-titled first album.

Saville&#x27;s album design for Joy Division&#x27;s last album, &quot;Closer&quot;, released shortly after the suicide of Ian Curtis in May 1980, was controversial in its depiction of Christ&#x27;s body entombed. However, the design pre-dated Curtis&#x27;s death, which the magazine &quot;New Musical Express&quot; confirmed, since it had been displaying proofs of the artwork in its offices for several months.

Saville&#x27;s output from this period included re-appropriation from the canon of art and design. Design critic Alice Twemlow wrote: &quot;... in the 1980s ... he would directly and irreverently &#x27;lift&#x27; an image from one genre—art history for example—and recontextualise it in another. A Fantin-Latour &#x27;Roses&#x27; painting in combination with a colour-coded alphabet became the seminal album cover for New Order&#x27;s &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; (1983), for example.&quot;

In the 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;, which is based on Tony Wilson and the history of Factory Records, Saville is portrayed by actor Enzo Cilenti. His reputation for missing deadlines is comically highlighted in the film.

==Non-Factory work==

In 1979, Saville moved from Manchester to London and became art director of the Virgin offshoot Dindisc. He subsequently created a body of work that furthered his refined take on modernism, producing work for artists such as Roxy Music, Wham!, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Ultravox and Peter Gabriel. During his time at Dindisc, he also designed the sleeve for Canadian band Martha and the Muffins’ album &quot;Metro Music&quot;. He was paid more to design Gabriel&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;So&quot; than for any other record sleeve in his career; he received £20,000. Saville founded the design agency Peter Saville Associates (still designing primarily for musical artists and record labels), which included Brett Wickens, before he was invited to close his office in 1990 to join the partner-owned Pentagram. Saville collaborated with Transport for Greater Manchester in 2008 for the rebranding of the Metrolink tram system with a yellow and silver polka-dot scheme after a period of significant expansion had been undertaken on the network.

==Work after Factory Records==

In 1993 Saville left London and moved to Los Angeles, to join ad agency Frankfurt Balkind with Brett Wickens. Saville soon returned to London, however, where he asked designer Howard Wakefield to restart the design studio. For three years they worked from &quot;The Apartment&quot; in partnership with German advertising agency Meiré &amp; Meiré. Saville&#x27;s modernist apartment in Mayfair doubled as the London studio. (The same apartment is depicted in the record sleeve of Pulp&#x27;s album &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;.) The Apartment produced works for clients such as Mandarina Duck and Smart Car. In 1999 Saville moved to offices in Clerkenwell.

Saville grew in demand as a younger generation of people in advertising and fashion had grown up with his work for Factory Records. He reached a creative and a commercial peak with design consultancy clients such as Selfridges, EMI and Pringle. Other significant commissions came from the field of fashion. Saville&#x27;s fashion clients have included Jil Sander, John Galliano, Yohji Yamamoto, Christian Dior, Stella McCartney and Calvin Klein Saville often worked in collaboration with longtime friend, fashion photographer Nick Knight. The two launched the art and fashion website SHOWstudio in November 2000. Belgian fashion designer Raf Simons was granted full access to the archives of Saville&#x27;s vintage Factory projects and made a personal selection of Saville-designed works to integrate them into Raf Simons &quot;Closer&quot; Autumn/Winter 2003-04 collection. Raf Simons Spring/Summer 2018 collection also features a selection of archival works by Saville.

In 2004 Saville became Creative Director of the City of Manchester, playing a strategic role in the regeneration and cultural renaissance of his home city, notably defining the ethos for the Manchester International Festival.

In 2010 Saville designed the England football team home shirt.
Saville has three D&amp;AD awards, is a Royal Designer for Industry and won the London Design Medal in 2013. 
In 2012 Saville collaborated with Dovecot Studios, Edinburgh in celebration of their centenary to create a large scale tapestry of his work After, After Monarch of the Glen. This new tapestry commission is Dovecot Studios re appropriation of Peter Saville&#x27;s appropriation of Sir Peter Blake&#x27;s appropriation of Sir Edwin Landseer&#x27;s 1851 painting &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot;.

In 2018, Saville redesigned the logo for British luxury fashion house Burberry, as revealed by then creative director Riccardo Tisci.

In July 2019 Saville was featured in the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Only Artists&quot; in conversation with industrial designer Marek Reichman.

Saville was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to design.

Saville works with Jony Ive&#x27;s studio LoveFrom.

==Exhibition, book and soundtrack==
Saville&#x27;s reclaimed status and contribution to graphic design were firmly established when London&#x27;s Design Museum exhibited his body of work in 2003. The exhibition, &quot;The Peter Saville Show&quot;, was open from 23 May through 14 September 2003. A book published by Frieze, &quot;Designed by Peter Saville&quot;, accompanied the exhibition. &quot;The Peter Saville Show Soundtrack&quot; for the exhibition was performed and recorded by New Order, and was available to early visitors to the exhibition.
==Swing Project==

Anna Blessmann and Peter Saville met in a gallery in Berlin in 2001 and soon began an artwork collaboration, works have been shown at Paul Stolper Gallery London, CRAC Alsace, Migros Museum Zurich, Whitechapel London and in various publications.

In 2010 they presented &#x27;Swing Project 1&#x27; in the FRAC Champagne-Ardenne, Reims and in 2012 &#x27;Swing Project 2&#x27; at Galerie Neu, Berlin. In 2013 they participated in the Fiorucci Art Trust &#x27;Volcano Extravaganza&#x27;, Stromboli. In 2014 they exhibited &#x27;Swing Project 3&#x27; at the Cabinet Gallery, London.

<doc id="970540" wikidata="Q7995190" url="?curid=970540" title="White Pepper">
<text>White Pepper is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Ween, and the last album they would release on Elektra Records. It was released on May 2, 2000.

==Promotion and commercial performance==
The band helped promote the album by performing &quot;Exactly Where I&#x27;m At&quot; on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The track &quot;Even If You Don&#x27;t&quot; was made into a music video and directed by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of &quot;South Park&quot; fame. According to Dean Ween (Mickey Melchiondo), he and Gene Ween (Aaron Freeman) are good friends of Parker and Stone, and Freeman has referred to them as &quot;kindred spirits.&quot;

&quot;Stay Forever&quot; was written for cellist Tanya Haden.

In November 2002, two and a half years after the album was released, Billboard magazine reported that White Pepper had sold 72,000 copies in the US alone. 

===Singles===
* &quot;Even If You Don&#x27;t&quot; was released as a single on Mushroom Records with the B-side &quot;Cornbread Red&quot;.
* &quot;Stay Forever&quot; was released as a single on Mushroom Records with &quot;The Grobe&quot; and &quot;Who Dat?&quot;. &quot;Who Dat?&quot; was also included in the Japanese version of the album.

==Legacy==
&quot;White Pepper&quot; was included on &quot;Creative Loafing&quot;″s list of the 101 best albums of the 2000s, while &quot;Glide&quot; magazine named it the 12th best album of the decade. &quot;Magnet&quot; included it at #15 on their list of the 60 best albums released between 1993 and 2003, and the album was included in the book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; in 2008. Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters named it one of his favorite albums of all time, stating: &quot;I love the stew of what they do – they can be whimsical, they can be heavy – they&#x27;re just incredible musicians and songwriters. To me, &quot;White Pepper&quot; is an amazing snapshot and a great collection of songs. They&#x27;re kind of like Beck – they&#x27;ve always delivered – and also some of it is just so fucking juvenile.&quot;

In 2020, &quot;Stereogum&quot;″s Nate Rogers wrote a piece on the album for its 20th anniversary. He attributed the initial lukewarm reception of the album to its lack of profanity and increased accessibility, suggesting that it may have alienated much of the band&#x27;s hardcore fans. &quot;It&#x27;s much easier to appreciate &quot;White Pepper&quot; now that we know it did not lead to a final form in which Ween were just edge-less and overglossed&quot; he wrote, &quot;The band never gave in to the powers that be. They never stopped being artists who deferred to the playful will of their mighty Demon God Boognish while also writing frequently — if not perpetually — fantastic music.&quot;

<doc id="970543" wikidata="Q7874470" url="?curid=970543" title="USS Sunfish (SSN-649)">
<text>USS &quot;Sunfish&quot; (SSN-649), a &quot;Sturgeon&quot;-class attack submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the ocean sunfish (&quot;Mola mola&quot;), a marine species having a deep body truncated behind, and high dorsal and anal fins.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Sunfish&quot; was awarded to the General Dynamics Quincy Shipbuilding Division in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 26 March 1963 and her keel was laid down there on 15 January 1965. She was one of the two nuclear submarines built at the former Fore River Shipyard, the other being USS Whale (SSN-638). Whale&#x27;s keel was laid down on 27 May 1964 and these two were the only submarines built there since 1925.

She was launched on 14 October 1966, sponsored by Mrs. Robert C. Byrd, the wife of United States Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, and commissioned on 15 March 1969.

==Service history==

===1969–1975===
&quot;Sunfish&quot; spent the period from April to August 1969 undergoing shakedown and in various exercises such as torpedo firing, sound trials, control drills, and casualty drills. A short dedependents&#x27; cruise in late August 1969 was followed by post-shakedown repairs and alterations at Groton, Connecticut. The last two weeks of 1969 were devoted to a leave and recreation period for the crew.
&quot;Sunfish&quot; spent early 1970 in upkeep periods and several short cruises in preparation for an extended deployment. She was deployed from 16 June to 26 August 1970, when she arrived at her home port, Charleston, South Carolina. She deployed again from 6 October to 1 December 1970.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; put to sea again on 22 January 1971 to participate in a short fleet exercise, but her operational commitments changed after she left port and she did not return until 9 March 1971. She made a cruise to Port Everglades, Florida, in April 1971, followed by a fleet exercise. She spent the remainder of 1971 participating in antisubmarine warfare exercises with destroyers and patrol aircraft.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; departed Charleston on 3 January 1972, for a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and a tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. She returned to her Charleston on 21 May 1972 and entered a stand-down period that lasted until early October, when she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for her first major .

The overhaul was completed in August 1973, and &quot;Sunfish&quot; proceeded to New London, Connecticut, for refresher training. She touched at Charleston in early November 1973, then continued to the Caribbean Sea for sound training and weapon systems tests.

&quot;Sunfish&quot; returned to Charleston on 9 December 1973 for a leave and upkeep period. She operated along the United States East Coast from New London to Cape Kennedy, Florida, until June 1974. During the period from June 1974 until December 1975, Sunfish completed highly successful Mediterranean and North Atlantic deployments as well as Western Atlantic operations and a successful MK 48 Torpedo SINKEX. She was awarded the Submarine Squadron Four Battle E and a Meritorious Unit Commendation.

===1978-1981===
The boat was scheduled for refit, and was sent to Ingalls Shipyard, East Bank facility, Pascagoula, Mississippi in the early part of 1978.
Ingalls was owned by Litton Industries at the time,
She successfully weathered Hurricane Frederic, which hit the Gulf Coast region.
There were numerous delays, but in early 1980, she completed her sea trials, and was again sent to her homeport at the United States Naval Base, Charleston, South Carolina, after a Caribbean visit to San Juan, Puerto Rico.

===1000th dive, 1996===
&quot;Sunfish&quot;″s home port had been changed to Norfolk, Virginia, by 1996, when she made history: Early that year, after pulling away from the submarine tender , &quot;Sunfish&quot; made her one thousandth dive. Commander Submarine Group 8, Rear Admiral Richard W. Mies, who had served on &quot;Sunfish&quot; from March 1970 to April 1973, was aboard to give the order to submerge for the history-making dive. On 4 March 1996, the U.S. Navy″s Chief of Naval Information released this story:

&quot;Sunfish&quot; made her last deployment to the Mediterranean in 1995 - 1996. Port visits included La Maddalena, Italy and Lisbon, Portugal. In September 1996, Sunfish departed Norfolk for the final time. After a transit through the Panama Canal, the crew became &quot;shellbacks&quot; by crossing the Equator (at a classified longitude). Sunfish stopped briefly in San Diego to offload torpedoes before her final underway to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Sunfish&quot; was decommissioned on 31 March 1997 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. her scrapping via the Nuclear-Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program at Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington was completed on 31 October 1997.

<text>Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. is an American company and a supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with operations spanning 26 states, Canada and the Caribbean. In particular, Martin Marietta Materials supplies resources for the construction of roads, sidewalks and foundations.

==History==
The present-day materials business is distantly descended from Superior Stone, an aggregates company founded in 1939 in Raleigh, North Carolina. In 1959, the company was purchased by the American-Marietta Corporation, which merged with the Glenn L. Martin Company a year later to form the Martin Marietta Corporation. In 1971, Martin Marietta acquired Harvey Aluminum, a company which made aluminum oxide, aluminum ingot and aircraft grade aluminum sheet. Martin Marietta merged with Lockheed Corporation in 1995, and a year later, Martin Marietta Materials was spun off as an independent company, with Lockheed Martin retaining various aerospace, defense, and other manufacturing lines of business.

Martin Marietta&#x27;s Magnesia Specialties business provides a full range of magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and dolomitic lime products.

<text>Tabaluga is a German media franchise featuring a fictional green dragon, created by German rock musician Peter Maffay, children&#x27;s songwriter Rolf Zuckowski and author Gregor Rottschalk. Artist Helme Heine drew the image of Tabaluga as it is currently known. The character Tabaluga was first introduced by Maffay in the musical fairy tale &quot;Tabaluga ... oder die Reise zur Vernunft&quot; (Tabaluga or... The Journey to Reason) in 1983. This first studio album was the step to success: within the next years some Helme Heine books, six sequel concept studio albums, two tours, a stage musical, &quot;Tabaluga und Lilli&quot; (&quot;Tabaluga and Lilli&quot;), based on the third concept album and many TV cartoons which have been broadcast in over 100 countries round the world followed and a children&#x27;s game show. Over 100 kindergartens and child care groups carry the word &quot;Tabaluga&quot; in their name.

== Fictional character biography ==
Tabaluga inhabits the fictional province of &quot;Greenland&quot;. He is about 7 &quot;dragon-years&quot; old (700 human years, as one year for a dragon is 100 for a human). His father Tyrion died when he was six. Little is known about his mother. Following his father&#x27;s death, Tabaluga became the last of the dragons.

In the first album, &quot;Tabaluga oder... die Reise zur Vernunft&quot;, Tabaluga is a young dragon who gets sent by his father Tyrion in a learning quest as a punishment for not listening his admonitions. Tabaluga, who only reveres imagination, must therefore find reason. On his travel he meets the Moon, a queen of time and order; the giant Grykolos, related to the tree of life; and the fire salamander Pyromella, who Tabaluga learns coexistence with. At one point, the stork Arafron advices him to consult the 200 years old turtle Nessaja and brings him to her, and by the way Tabaluga sees a pod of dolphins who just enjoy their existence. At the end of his journey, Nessaja tells him that she never wanted to grow and that she has remained a child deep down.

In the second album, &quot;Tabaluga und das leuchtende Schweigen&quot;, Tabaluga steals a magical jade stone from Tyrion and, when the latter doesn&#x27;t answer to his question about what is love, Tabaluga uses the stone to teleport. At the end of the rainbow he finds the Halfchild, the daughter of the Sun and the Moon, who cries because she cannot love herself without the Shining Silence. By advice of the rainbow, Tabaluga uses the stone to travel to a world without love, populated by robots who believe themselves to be perfect, and he only overloads them when he asks about love. Still desiring to know, he travels to the world of the shapeshifting Dream Woman, where he meets Deimon and the snake Bilingua, embodiments of hate and envy. After a last travel to the Ice World, where the cold-hearted Ice Princess keeps souls frozen forever, Tabaluga is deceived by a stranger that takes him away from his father. Tyrion fights Deimon and his fourth winds in his search for Tabaluga, and after a long battle, the old dragon is killed by Deimon, dying in remorse for not having answered to his son&#x27;s question. Tabaluga is crushed by his father&#x27;s death, but Death teaches him that Tyrion is now a star in the sky and that he will always love him. Next day, Tabaluga flies to the rainbow, where the Halfchild is now happy and with the Shining Silence, the mix of all colors. Looking upon all those he met in his travel, the dragon finally understands what love is.

In the third album, &quot;Tabaluga und Lilli&quot;, Tabaluga hears a strange noise and disobeys his father&#x27;s warning not to travel to the ice kingdom. There he finds king Arktos sculpting a daughter made of ice for himself, and although an angry Arktos forces him to fly away, Tabaluga is smitten with the figure. Exhausted, he sleeps and meets his father on a dream, being told that he will have to know new things as part of life. Next morning, after being taught politeness by bees, Tabaluga discovers a volcano operated by a Crater Man, and accidentally singes himself by triggering an eruption out of curiosity. He gets thrown to the webs of black widow spider Tarantula, whom he talks with about fear and love, and eventually finds an ice castle similar to a large casino. Arktos is here and offers Tabaluga to bet Lilli against his dragon fire in a play of dice; although the dragon wins, Lilli is revealed to move only through a golden key who the evil Arktos has. Deceived, Tabaluga finds the world collapsing around him and wonders whether it was dream or reality. He feels he has lost Lilli, but the hermit crab Ostrakes talks to him about the power of love advices him to use his fire on her. By doing so, the ice of her heart melts and she gains sentience, and she and an overjoyed Tabaluga embrace.

In the fourth album, &quot;Tabaluga und das verschenkte Glück&quot;, years after defeating Arkos, Tabaluga celebrates his seventh birthday. He receives many gifts, including from Arktos himself, but he ends up loaded with heavy jeweled chains he can barely move. The ice king offers to remove a crystal chain in exchange for it, and Tabaluga, free, soars away. He trades another chain for honey with the bees, gifts a sad river with another, uses another to mend the tree of life from his first adventure, grants another to a unlucky fellow, and gifts the penultimate to a dirty pig. He also meets the Silver Fox, a friend of Arktos who tries to steal his last chain, but Tabaluga gives it voluntarily and explains he only needs his fire to live. Free from the weight, Tabaluga boastfully tries to lift an iceberg, but gets trapped underneath and Arktos takes advantage to try to conquer Greenland. Fortunately for Tabaluga, all the people he gave his chains come and form a living chain to get him free. Tabaluga ponders about friendship and, being then gifted a mirror by Nessaja, decides he doesn&#x27;t want to keep holding doubts about himself.

In the fifth album, &quot;Tabaluga und die Zeichen der Zeit&quot;, when Tabaluga accidentally breaks his alarm clock, he fears he has stopped time, but a stone and a mayfly explain he has not. Arktos kills the mayfly, though, so Death appears under the form of a strange fellow and explains Tabaluga that lives can have different lengths. Still wanting to learn about time, Tabaluga meets the Lion, king of beasts, but the latter believes time is money and you can never have enough of both. That night, Tyrion appears to Tabaluga in a dream and tells him time cannot be bought and that he lacked time himself with his son. Tabaluga&#x27;s search for knowledge gets interrupted by his friends, who wish more time for everybody, and the four seasons, who sing four songs. With the song of summer, Arktos starts melting, but an amused Tabaluga saves him on the say that the two of them belong together. The dragon later finds a bazaar, where a dealer offers him a watch with 13 hours in exchange for his fire, but the man turns out to be the ungrateful Arktos and Tabaluga passes. He then finds Time in the form of a young woman, and she grants Tabaluga his greatest wish, to dance one more time with Lilli. When the dance is over, Tabaluga realizes that time only stops in dreams and that love is the only thing that can defeat it.

The sixth album, &quot;Tabaluga - Es lebe die Freundschaft!&quot;, sees Arktos attacking Greenland with a massive snow storm, burying Tabaluga under an avalanche. Although a bug and an army of ants manage to shovel Tabaluga free, he has lost his memory, so the bug must help him recover it. He finds the volcano from the third album and causes an enormous eruption the same way he did then, threatening both Greenland and the ice kingdom. Tabaluga and Arktos must work together to stop the volcano, and in the process they finally become friends.

=== Cartoon series ===

An animated television series was produced by Yoram Gross-Village Roadshow and Yoram Gross-EM.TV. It was broadcast from 1997 to 2004 with a total of 78 episodes split into 3 seasons. In this series, Tabaluga is the last of the dragons, and as revealed in the second season, is the crown-prince of Greenland, a magical place inhabited by talking animals of many different species. Tabaluga must defend his home from two rival kingdoms on either side of Greenland; a frigid arctic tundra, ruled by the evil snowman Arktos and a searing desert, ruled by an evil sand-spirit named Humsin.

=== Tabaluga tivi ===
&quot;Tabaluga tivi&quot; was a 90-minute television children&#x27;s entertainment and game show similar to Disney Club or its German derivative, Tigerenten Club, that ran on ZDF from October 4, 1997 to 2011, serving as a mother show to the cartoon series. It featured the little green dragon Tabaluga, his friend Happy (a snow hare), his enemy Arktos (a wicked snowman) as well as the Penguin Butler &quot;James&quot; (who is a loyal servant of Arktos). It consisted of games, sketches, cartoons and short documentaries and was hosted by Tabaluga and some human co-hosts that changed multiple times over the years.

In the show, two teams play against each other in five competition rounds to win prizes for themselves, and to win the contents of a treasure chest, which they can donate to their school, a children&#x27;s home, etc. The broadcast is transmitted by ZDF and also KiKa. In Summer 2005 the show celebrated its 400th transmission. The show is made for ZDF in co-production with Munich Production Company MingaMedia and is made in the Bavaria-Studios in Unterföhring, near Munich.

=== Musical ===
The musical &quot;Tabaluga &amp; Lilli&quot; celebrated its premiere on 24 September 1999 in the TheatrO CentrO, Oberhausen, and ran there until 30 June 2001. The little dragon managed to unite the High Society of German musical actors, with stars such as Andreas Bieber, Ross Antony, Paul Kribbe, Carolin Fortenbacher. Its plot is a combination of the second and third concept albums.

In the musical, the race of the dragons is almost extinct in the battle against the kingdom of ice led by Arktos. The last great dragon king, Tyrion, has placed his hopes on his young son, Tabaluga, who must find the True Fire in order to defeat the evil. Therefore, aided by a wise wizard, Tabaluga sets out on a quest for the fire, avoiding dangers such as a black widow spider but also finding beautiful things like a group of dolphins. In this travel, Tabaluga learns that there is both good and bad in the world and that everything has its meaning a place in life.

In order to defeat Tabaluga, Arktos creates a beautiful girl of pure ice, Lilli, and sends her to charm Tabaluga so he cannot end his search for the True Fire. Tabaluga falls in love with Lilli and the plan seems to be working, and during a battle, Tyrion dies trying to protect him. Crushed, Tabaluga wants to give up, believing that his life without his father has no meaning anymore. However, he then realizes he has finally found the True Fire, which was actually the fire of love. Arktos&#x27; powers then wane and good triumphs over evil.

=== Film ===

&quot;Tabaluga&quot; (also known as &quot;Tabaluga &amp; Lilli&quot;) was a 2018 animated film directed by Sven Unterwaldt Jr. and starring Wincent Weiss in the title role. The story follows Tabaluga, who teams up with an ice princess, Lilli, to help him find his fire, and save the world from the evil snowman, Arktos.

<doc id="970554" wikidata="Q1881065" url="?curid=970554" title="Centaurus A/M83 Group">
<text>The Centaurus A/M83 Group is a complex group of galaxies in the constellations Hydra, Centaurus, and Virgo. The group may be roughly divided into two subgroups. The Cen A Subgroup, at a distance of 11.9 Mly (3.66 Mpc), is centered on Centaurus A, a nearby radio galaxy. The M83 Subgroup, at a distance of 14.9 Mly (4.56 Mpc), is centered on the Messier 83 (M83), a face-on spiral galaxy.

This group is sometimes identified as one group and sometimes identified as two groups. Hence, some references will refer to two objects named the &quot;Centaurus A Group&quot; and the &quot;M83 Group&quot;. However, the galaxies around Centaurus A and the galaxies around M83 are physically close to each other, and both subgroups appear not to be moving relative to each other.

The Centaurus A/M83 Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster, the local supercluster of which the Local Group is an outlying member.

==Members==

===Member identification===

The brightest group members were frequently identified in early galaxy group identification surveys. However, many of the dwarf galaxies in the group were only identified in more intensive studies. One of the first of these identified 145 faint objects on
optical images from the UK Schmidt Telescope and followed these up in hydrogen line emission with the Parkes Radio Telescope and in the hydrogen-alpha spectral line with the Siding Spring 2.3 m Telescope. This
identified 20 dwarf galaxies as members of the group. The HIPASS survey, which was a blind radio survey for hydrogen spectral line emission, found five uncatalogued galaxies in the group and also identified five previously-catalogued galaxies as members. An additional dwarf galaxy was identified as a group member in the HIDEEP survey, which was a more intensive radio survey for hydrogen emission within a smaller region of the sky. Several optical surveys later identified 20 more candidate objects to the group.
In 2007, the Cen A group membership of NGC 5011C was established. 

While this galaxy is a well-known stellar system 
listed with a NGC number, its true identity remained hidden because of coordinate confusion and wrong redshifts in the literature. From 2015 to 2017 a full optical survey was conducted using the Dark Energy Camera, covering 550 square degrees in the sky and doubling the number of known dwarf galaxies in this group. Another deep but spatially limited survey around Centaurus A revealed numerous new dwarfs.

The dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Centaurus A group have been studied and have been found to have old, metal-poor stellar populations similar to those in the Local Group, and follow a similar metallicity–luminosity relation. One dwarf galaxy, KK98 203 (LEDA 166167), has an extended ring of Hα emission.

===Member list===

The table below lists galaxies that have been identified as associated with the Centaurus A/M83 Group by I. D. Karachentsev and collaborators. Note that Karachentsev divides this group into two subgroups centered on Centaurus A and Messier 83.


Additionally, ESO 219-010, PGC 39032, and PGC 51659 are listed as possibly being members of the Centaurus A Subgroup, and ESO 381-018, NGC 5408, and PGC 43048 are listed as possibly being members of the M83 Subgroup. Although HIPASS J1337-39 is only listed as a possible member of the M83 Subgroup in the later list published by Karachentsev, later analyses indicate that this galaxy is within the subgroup.
Saviane and Jerjen found that NGC 5011C has an optical redshift of 647 km/s and thus is a member of the Cen A group 
rather than of the distant Centaurus galaxy cluster as believed since 1983.

<text>Zhangjiakou (), also known as Kalgan and by several other names, is a prefecture-level city in northwestern Hebei province in Northern China, bordering Beijing to the southeast, Inner Mongolia to the north and west, and Shanxi to the southwest. By 2020, its population was 4,118,908 inhabitants on , divided into 17 Counties and Districts. The built-up (&quot;or metro&quot;) area made of Qiaoxi, Qiaodong, Chongli, Xuanhua, Xiahuayuan Districts largely being conurbated had 1,413,861 inhabitants in 2020 on .

Since ancient times, Zhangjiakou has been a stronghold of military significance and vied for by multiple sides, hence nicknamed the Northern Gate of Beijing. Due to its strategic position on several important transport arteries, it is a critical node for travel between Hebei and Inner Mongolia and connecting northwest China, Mongolia, and Beijing. Dajingmen, an important gate and junction of the Great Wall of China is located here.

In the south, Zhangjiakou is largely cultivated for agricultural use. In the north, Bashang is a part of the Mongolian plateau and dominated by grasslands. The forest coverage reaches 37%, earning Zhangjiakou the title of National Forest City. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Zhangjiakou has the freshest air and the least PM 2.5 pollution of all Chinese cities north of the Yellow River. Zhangjiakou also possesses 4.6% of China&#x27;s wind energy resources, and the city ranks second in solar energy use. Zhangjiakou was one of the host cities at the 2022 Winter Olympics.

==Names==
Zhangjiakou is the atonal pinyin romanization of the Chinese name written in traditional characters and in simplified ones, meaning &quot;pass of the Zhang family&quot;. It is written in tonal pinyin and was formerly romanized as Chang-chia-k&#x27;ou in Wade–Giles and as Changchiakow in Postal Map romanization. The name is a clipping of Zhangjiakoubu ), &quot;earthwork fortress of the Zhang family&quot;, named in honor of the Ming-era official Zhang Wen ) who directed its construction from 1429. During China&#x27;s Republican Era, the town was also known in Chinese as Zhangyuan ), &quot;the Zhang Wall&quot;.

Until the mid-20th century, Zhangjiakou was more often known to Europeans as Kalgan from its classical Mongolian name meaning barrier or beam gate, but actually a shortened form of the full name &quot;assembly&quot; or &quot;meeting gate&quot; from its importance along Sino-Mongolian trade routes. The modern Mongolian forms of these names are () and (). The Manchu form of the name was ().

During the Ming dynasty, when the city was a major military outpost against the Northern Yuan, it was also known as Wucheng ), &quot;Martial&quot; or &quot;War Town&quot;. Because of its strategic position above and northwest of Beijing, Zhangjiakou has been nicknamed &quot;Beijing&#x27;s Northern Door&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-Qin era===
There are many paleolithic remains like Nihewan, Xiaochangliang, and Maquangou located in Guyuan county, which indicated human activities dating back possibly 2 million years ago.

Around 2500 BC, the legendary ancestors of Chinese people, Huangdi, Yandi, and Chiyou used to live in the area of Zhuolu Town, and later fought the Battle of Zhuolu and Battle of Banquan, amalgamating different tribes into a single Huaxia tribe, thus beginning Chinese history.

During Spring and Autumn period, Xiongnu and Donghu people inhabited the northern area while Yan State (since around 11th century BC) and Dai state (since 7th century BC) occupied the southern area. In 475 BC, Dai was occupied by Zhao Wuxu of Zhao State. In 300 BC, King Wuling of Zhao established Dai Commandery, managing the area of ancient Dai state with its administrative center in Dai, currently Daiwangcheng, Yu County. During the same period of time, King Zhao of Yan sent General Qin Kai who was once captured by Donghu people and thus became familiar with their tactics to defeat Donghu. Following that, Yan State built Great Wall in its border extending from Zaoyang (currently northeast of Xuanhua) to Xiangping (currently north of Liaoyang). In 283 BC, King Zhao established Shanggu Commandery. In 265 BC, Li Mu, a famous general of Zhao, commanded and deployed troops in Dai to protect against Xiongnu. After arriving in Dai, initially Li Mu banned any counterattack against Xiongnu to preserve the strength for years, which however incurred the discontent of King of Zhao. As a result, Li Mu was sacked. Following Zhao troops&#x27; defeat later, King of Zhao reinstated Li Mu. Viewing Zhao troops as cowards, Xiongnu grew arrogant and underestimated Zhao&#x27;s strength. Finally, Li Mu led troops and ambushed Xiongnu, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and great damage of Xiongnu, thus ensuring decades of peace in Zhao&#x27;s borderlands.

In 228 BC, Wang Jian, a Qin general defeated Zhao army and occupied its capital, Handan. Jia, a son of Zhao king, escaped to Dai, currently northeast of Yu County and declared himself as the King of Dai. In alliance with Xi, King of Yan, the combined army, commanded by Crown Prince Dan was defeated at Yishui. In 222 BC, Wang Ben, a Qin general defeated Yan state and then, attacked Dai. He captured Jia and ended Dai as a state. Jia feared humiliation and committed suicide.

=== Qin–Han era ===
During the Qin dynasty, Shihuangdi sent Meng Tian, commanding 300,000 troops to defend his empire from Xiongnu&#x27;s attacks. They spent 10 years connecting the Great Wall of Yan, Qin and Zhao, thus building Great Wall of Qin, the first Great Wall of 10,000 li, its 80-kilometer-long relics currently located in Batou (), or Erdaogou () in local slang, to the north of Zhangjiakou downtown area. The southern area of Zhangjiakou was under jurisdiction of Dai Commandery and Shanggu Commandery.

During the Han dynasty, most part of the area belonged to You Prefecture while some parts belonged to Wuhuan, Xiongnu and Xianbei. When Liu Bang established the Han dynasty, he granted Dai and the title of King of Dai to his brother Liu Zhong in 201 BC. One year later, Liu Zhong was defeated by Modu Chanyu of Xiongnu and escaped, thus demoted. In 196 BC, Chen Xi, the chancellor of Zhao, rebelled against the emperor and occupied more than 20 cities soon after. As a result, Liu Bang commanded an army in person from Luoyang. During the war, the empress launched a coup d&#x27;état and killed Han Xin, the most important general who helped establish the Han dynasty. With the help of Fan Kuai and Zhou Bo, Liu Bang defeated Chen Xi very soon. Following the rebellion, Liu Bang granted the title of King of Dai to his third son, Liu Heng, later Emperor Wen of Han.

Zhangjiakou was a major battleground during Han–Xiongnu War. In 127 BC, Xiongnu cavalry attacked Shanggu (currently Huailai), Yuyang. The Emperor Wu of Han launched a successful counterattack. In 124 BC, Xiongnu cavalry invaded Dai Commandery. Emperor Wu ordered Wei Qing commanding 100,000 troops to counterattack. Wei Qing left the Great Wall more than 600 to 700 kilometers, encircled Xiongnu&#x27;s head, Youxianwang (). In 122 BC, 50,000 Xiongnu invaded Shanggu, killed hundreds of people. In next March, Huo Qubing commanded 10,000 cavalry to counterattack and achieved success. In 119 BC, Wei Qing and Huo Qubing each commanded 50,000 cavalry. Huo Qubing departed from Dai Commandery, marched 2000 li northward crossing Gobi desert. Finally, Han troops defeated Xiongnu under Yizhixie completely. Following the success, a new office, the Colonel-Protector of the Wuhuan (), was established in Shanggu in order to prevent contact between the Wuhuan with the Xiongnu and to use them to monitor the Xiongnu activities. In 106 BC, Emperor Wu of Han organized the Western Han dynasty into 13 province-sized prefectures, each administered by a cishi () or inspector, thus putting Shanggu and Dai under the jurisdiction of You Prefecture.

Following the Xin dynasty, Lu Fang () rebelled against Han but was defeated. Then, Emperor Guangwu of Han granted him the King of Dai. In 48 AD, the Eastern Han dynasty established Colonel-Protector of the Wuhuan in Ningcheng (), Shanggu (currently, Ningyuanbao Qiaodong District), representing Han&#x27;s management of Wuhuan. Meanwhile, Han also opened Hu Market () to conduct regular exchanges with Wuhuan in Ningcheng. From 110 AD, Ningcheng also began to manage affairs with Xianbei.

=== Jin–Sui era ===
In 274, Western Jin divided Shanggu Commandery and established Guangning Commandery () in Xialuo (, in the west of present Zhuolu), which was disestablished during Northern Qi.

During the period known as Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese history when the northern China was repeatedly invaded and occupied various nomadic peoples from further north, Zhangjiakou area became part of Dai, Former Yan, ultimately ruled by Northern Wei of Xianbei. In 310, by helping Jin&#x27;s Liu Kun, the governor of Bingzhou to fight Xiongnu state of Han Zhao, Tuoba Yilu, the supreme chieftain of the Tuoba, was appointed Duke of Dai by Western Jin and since 315, the King of Dai. In 376, Dai was conquered by Former Qin state.

Former Qin fell into disarray in 383 following its defeat by Jin forces at the Battle of Fei River. In 386, Tuoba Gui, the grandson of Tuoba Shiyiqian, the last King of Dai, took the opportunity to reestablish Dai and soon changed its name from Dai to Wei. Initially, Tuoba Gui was a vassal of Later Yan but claimed imperial title in 397 after defeating Murong Bao of Yan in Battle of Canhe Slope. Later, Tuoba Gui was given the title of Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei.

In 423, in order to defend itself from Rouran&#x27;s invasions, Northern Wei built a Great Wall from Chicheng to the east and Wuyuan to the West, and established Huaihuang (, in present Zhangbei), Rouxuan (, in present Shangyi), Woye (, in present Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia) as two of the Six Frontier Towns. Later on, Yuyi (, in present Chicheng and Guyuan ) was added. In 523, an uprising happened in Huaihuang, thus starting the Rebellion of Six Frontier Towns, an anti-Sinicization movement among northern peoples. In 525, Du Luozhou () led Shanggu Uprising, leading to many similar uprising to respond, including Gao Huan&#x27;s. Next year, Du Luozhou broke through Juyong Pass and occupied You Prefecture.

=== Tang–Song era ===
In 645, Taizong of Tang had a north march in Jiming Mountain () during his campaign against Xueyantuo. In 822, Tang established Longmen County () and Huai&#x27;an County (), thus the first appearance of Huai’an. In 866. Tang established Xinzhou (), the administrative center located to the west of Zhuolu. In 877, Li Keyong, the grandfather of Li Cunxu, later the emperor of Later Tang, was serving as the deputy commander of the Shatuo troops and stationed in Yuzhou, turning this place into his base for future struggles. In 899, Wuzhou () was established with its administrative center in Xuanhua. Meanwhile, Wende County () was established, the administrative center in present Xuanhua.

During the period of Five Dynasties, Zhangjiakou area, like other places in northern China, underwent repeated changes of rules of different dynasties. In 937, in order to enlist the help from Khitan people to defeat Later Tang, Shi Jingtang of Later Jin (Five Dynasties) agreed to cede Sixteen Prefectures to Khitan, later Liao dynasty, in which Xinzhou (, present Zhuolu), Weizhou (, Huailai), Wuzhou (), Yuzhou () were included. The Sixteen Prefectures held strategic locations in the north and because the Great Wall was across Zhangjiakou area, the cession left China in a vulnerable position against the invasions from the north. In 951, Yelu Ruan, the Emperor Shizong of Liao intended to attack Later Zhou in the south despite the reluctance of many subordinate tribes. While passing Huoshendian (), the west of Xinzhou, a rebellion broke out and Yelu Gecha () and Yelu Pendu () assassinated the drunken emperor. The rebellion was put down very soon by Shizong&#x27;s successor, Yelu Jing, the Emperor Muzong of Liao.

During the reign of Emperor Jingzong of Liao, the empress Xiao Yanyan often took part in politics and war. She often stationed troops in Yanzicheng (present Zhangbei), the name of which is believed to derive from Xiao Yanyan in preparations for the War against Song. Attracted by the beautiful scenery in Zhangjiakou area, she built two royal gardens, Shanghuayuan () and Xiahuayuan (, in present Xiahuayuan District). Xiao resided there often and enlisted many talent in his war with the Song dynasty.

In 1168, the Emperor Shizong of Jin traveled to Helihudongchuan (). Seeing the fully blossoming yellow flowers, he named the yellow flowers Jinlianhua () and the place became Jinlianchuan ().

=== Yuan–Ming–Qing era ===

In August 1211, during the Battle of Yehuling, Genghis Khan&#x27;s 90,000 strong force destroyed the 450,000 strong Jin dynasty army. In 1251, Möngke Khan became the Khagan of the Mongol Empire. He put Kublai, his brother, in charge of affairs of northern China. Kublai established Jinlianchuan Mufu (), enlisting many talent of Han people like Liu Bingzhong to assist his governance. Kublai regularly consulted them and discussed politics, religion ranging from Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism.

In 1307, Külüg Khan or the Emperor Wuzong of Yuan began the construction of Yuan Zhongdu () in Onggachatu (, north to present Zhangbei) where the court was moved. However, before full completion, Emperor Wuzong died soon and his successor Wuzong&#x27;s brother, Emperor Renzong of Yuan called it off. In August 1329, during Tianli Incident following the War of the Two Capitals, the new emperor Khutughtu Khan Kusala was poisoned to death by El Temür in Zhongdu. Zhongdu was later destroyed in 1357 during the Red Turban Rebellion as the rebels marched towards Shangdu.

In 1370, Zhu Yuanzhang ordered his general, Tang He, to occupy Xuande (), later changed to Xuanfu (), Hua Yunlong to occupy Yunzhou (), seated in the north of Chicheng. Xuanfu was one of the Nine Garrisons of the Ming dynasty. In order to defend China proper from invasions from the north, Ming emperors, especially Yongle Emperor (who sent the fleet of Zheng He journeying as far as East Africa) put great emphasis on the building of defensive forces in northern China, where most troops were deployed in Xuanfu, reaching 151 thousand during 1403 to 1424. Fighting Mongols, Yongle Emperor&#x27;s campaigns against the Mongols mainly took place to the north of Zhangjiakou. In 1429, the official Zhang Wen began fortifying the city, which was subsequently renamed in his honor.
On September 1, 1449, while retreating from the campaign against Mongols (Oirats), the 500,000-man army was defeated and the Emperor Yingzong of Ming was captured by chasing Mongolian troops in Huailai County, which was later called Tumu Crisis. The Emperor was sent back next year but only restored his throne in 1457. In 1529, local officer Zhang Zhen () built a small gate to north, which was strengthen in 1574 and 1581. Zhangjiakoubu enjoyed a paramount strategic position, thus being called Wuheng (). Therefore, Zhangjiakoubu was the origin and starting point of modern-day Zhangjiakou City.
In 1514 and 1517, Dayan Khan led Mongol troops to invade China, causing great damage. He built forts in Xuanhua and Datong and stationed 15000 troops on Ming territory. Culminating in the Battle of Yingzhou () in 1517, Dayan Khan was killed in the battle. From 1545, Xuanda Governor Weng Wanda () began building Xuanfu Great Wall, reaching 462 li (231 km) next year. In 1545, he built Great Walls again, reaching 169 li (84.5 km), effectively defending the area of Mongol cavalry&#x27;s invasion.

In 1571, Altan Khan of Mongols received the title &quot;Prince of Shunyi&quot; (Obedient and Righteous Prince) from the Longqing Emperor, thus reaching an agreement of lasting peace with Ming. Since then, the city of Zhangjiakou was transformed from a military base to an important horse market for Mongolian mounts imported into China. The water-scarce city was historically the chief northern gate in the Great Wall to China for Europeans travelling along the Northern Tea Road through Juyong Pass, including Ivan Petlin in 1619 and Nicolae Milescu. From 1727 it was an important station for the Kyakhta trade between Russia and China. In early autumn long lines of camels would come in from all quarters for the conveyance of the tea chests from Zhangjiakou to Kyakhta across the Gobi Desert. Each caravan usually made three journeys in the winter. In the 19th century, the town had an estimated population of 70100,000 and some Russian merchants had permanent residences and warehouses just outside the gate.

===Modern history===

In October 1909, Zhangjiakou was connected with Beijing by Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway, the first railway solely designed and built by Chinese people. Zhan Tianyou was the chief engineer. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica noted that, in Kalgan, &quot;the ordinary houses have an unusual appearance, from the fact that they are mostly roofed with earth and become covered with green-sward&quot; and that &quot;on the way to Peking the road passes over a beautiful bridge of seven arches, ornamented with marble figures of animals&quot;. Following Xinhai Revolution, Zhangjiakou was incorporated into Chahar Special Administrative Region, later changed to Chahar Province in 1928, after the success of Northern Expedition of Kuomintang.

In 1937, the Japanese occupied the region and made Kalgan the capital of the autonomous Cha-nan (South Chahar) Province. The Federated Mengjiang Commission was set up to supervise the economic affairs, banking, communications, and industry of Japanese-occupied Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang).

During the second phase of the Chinese Civil War, The 35th Army under Fu Zuoyi was surrounded at Xinbao&#x27;an of Zhangjiakou and defeated. This caused Fu Zuo Yi to quickly strike a deal with the Communists and make peace.

In the early 1960s, at the height of Sino-Soviet tensions, Zhangjiakou was considered one of the most important cities in China for military strategy reasons. Zhangjiakou was aptly nicknamed, &quot;Beijing&#x27;s Northern Door&quot;, because whoever controlled Zhangjiakou was in a good position to either attack (in the case of the Soviets) or defend (in the case of the Chinese) Beijing.

Zhangjiakou hosted some of the events in the 2022 Winter Olympics.

==Tourism==

Lying in between the Mongolian Plateau and the North China Plain, Zhangjiakou has a somewhat rugged topography characterized by high mountains, deep valleys, and rocky pathways. As a result, it serves as a perfect natural screen for Beijing, which has made it a strategic priority militarily since ancient times. It is called &quot;The Gateway to Beijing&quot; and &quot;The Mountain City beyond the Great Wall&quot;. The grand Yan Mountain, the towering Taihang Mountain, the vast grasslands, and the meandering Sangyang River converge here.

<text>Albert Hanlin &quot;Al&quot; Crews Jr. (born March 23, 1929), (Col, USAF, Ret.), is a former American chemical and aeronautical engineer, and U.S. Air Force astronaut.

==Early life and education==
He was born on March 23, 1929, in El Dorado, Arkansas. He graduated in 1950 from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (then named Southwestern Louisiana Institute) with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering. He earned a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1959.

==Test pilot==

As a USAF Test Pilot School graduate, he was selected as a military astronaut designee in the second group of X-20 Dyna-Soar astronauts on April 20, 1962, and assigned as a Dyna-Soar pilot on September 20, 1962. The Dyna-Soar program was cancelled in 1963. On November 12, 1965, he was selected as an astronaut in the first group for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. He transferred to NASA Flight Crew Directorate at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, in June 1969 when the MOL program was cancelled. He remained a pilot for NASA, flying such aircraft as the &quot;Super Guppy&quot; outsize cargo transport, the WB-57F atmospheric research aircraft and the OV-095 SAIL Space Shuttle simulator until he retired at age 65.

==Personal life==
He is married, with three children from his previous marriage.

<text>Edward Twitchell Hall Jr. (May 16, 1914 – July 20, 2009) was an American anthropologist and cross-cultural researcher. He is remembered for developing the concept of proxemics and exploring cultural and social cohesion, and describing how people behave and react in different types of culturally defined personal space. Hall was an influential colleague of Marshall McLuhan and Buckminster Fuller.

==Biography==
Hall was born in Webster Groves, Missouri and taught at the University of Denver, Colorado; Bennington College in Vermont; Harvard Business School; Illinois Institute of Technology; Northwestern University in Illinois and others. The foundation for his lifelong research on cultural perceptions of space was laid during World War II, when he served in the U.S. Army in Europe and the Philippines.

From 1933 through 1937, Hall lived and worked with the Navajo and the Hopi on Native American reservations in northeastern Arizona, the subject of his autobiographical &quot;West of the Thirties.&quot; He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1942 and continued with field work and direct experience throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. During the 1950s he worked for the United States State Department, at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), teaching inter-cultural communications skills to foreign service personnel, developed the concepts of high-context and low-context cultures, and wrote several popular practical books on dealing with cross-cultural issues. He is considered a founding father of intercultural communication as an academic area of study.

Throughout his career, Hall introduced a number of new concepts, including proxemics, monochronic time, polychronic time, and high-context and low-context cultures. In his second book, &quot;The Hidden Dimension&quot; (1966), he describes the culturally specific temporal and spatial dimensions that surround each of us, such as the physical distances people maintain in different contexts.

In &quot;The Silent Language&quot; (1959), Hall coined the term &quot;polychronic&quot; to describe the ability to attend to multiple events simultaneously, as opposed to &quot;monochronic&quot; individuals and cultures who tend to handle events sequentially.

In the 1960s, Hall published his theory of proxemics, the study of the human use of space, creating a new field of research investigating the nature of personal and public space, and how it may differ between cultures.

In 1976, he released his third book, &quot;Beyond Culture&quot;, which is notable for having developed the idea of extension transference; by an extension, he simply means any technological item, from clothes to laptops. He brings to our attention the fact that these &#x27;extensions&#x27; only help us perform certain functions, but they as extensions will never quite be able to carry out these functions by themselves (for example, think about computers, airplanes, etc. We can fly with airplanes, but we can&#x27;t on our own and nor can airplanes fly &#x27;on their own&#x27;). His biggest claim is that culture itself is an extension of man. Extensions also exist in their own evolutionary realm, as well. That is, they evolve on their own and do not directly influence human evolution.

&quot;The Dance of Life: The Other Dimension of Time&quot; (1983) describes different types of time in a provocative cross-cultural exploration of how time varies across cultures. Hall develops a classification system of nine different types of time. Particularly interesting are his ideas about how rhythms and music structure cultural interaction in different cultures.

The &#x27;transference&#x27; of &#x27;extension transference&#x27; is a term he coined to describe when people regard a symbol to actually be its referent. The clearest example of this would be language; like when people do not realize that words are merely symbolic to their referents. For example, there is nothing inherently watery about the physical object &quot;water&quot;, at least in terms of the symbolic acoustic properties that are produced when someone utters &quot;water&quot;. Evidence for this would be the fact that across languages there are thousands of unique words that all refer to water. Culture, as an extension, is also a good example; extension transference of culture happens naturally when people are unaware of the extent to which culture shapes how they perceive time and space, or that culture shapes their perception of them at all. Time and space are the two prominent aspects that Hall in particular focuses on in many of his works.

He died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 20, 2009.

==Influence==
According to Nina Brown, the work of Hall was so groundbreaking that it created a multitude of other areas for research. One of the most widely sought after topics of anthropology is an idea that was first introduced by Edward Hall: Anthropology of Space. Brown goes on to mention that the Anthropology of Space has essentially opened the door to dozens of new topics. Along with influencing the Anthropology of Space, Hall&#x27;s research had a substantial influence on the development of intercultural communication as a research topic. Since at least 1990, he has been acknowledged frequently for his role in introducing nonverbal aspects of communication, specifically proxemics, the study of the social uses of space, the investigation of communication between members of different cultures. For example, Robert Shuter, a well-known intercultural communication researcher, commented: &quot;Edward Hall&#x27;s research reflects the regimen and passion of an anthropologist: a deep regard for culture explored principally by descriptive, qualitative methods... The challenge for intercultural communication... is to develop a research direction and teaching agenda that returns culture to preeminence and reflects the roots of the field as represented in Edward Hall&#x27;s early research.&quot;

What was particularly innovative about Hall&#x27;s early work is that instead of focusing on a single culture at a time, or cross-cultural comparison, as was typical in 1950s’ anthropology, he responded to the needs of his students at the Foreign Service Institute of the Department of State to help them understand interactions between members of different cultures. Hall points out that the only environment in which classroom dialogue is encountered is simply in the classroom, ergo it served the students little use when actually in the foreign country of interest. At the same time, and in response to the same students, he narrowed his focus from an entire culture, as was then standard within anthropology, to smaller moments of interaction. Colleagues working with him at FSI at the time included Henry Lee Smith, George L. Trager, Charles F. Hockett, and Ray Birdwhistell. Between them, they used descriptive linguistics as a model for not only proxemics but also kinesics and paralanguage.

<text>Featherston () is a town in the South Wairarapa District, in the Wellington Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is at the eastern foothills of Remutaka Range close to the northern shore of Lake Wairarapa, north-east of central Wellington and south-west of Masterton.

The town has a population of Featherston has increasingly become a satellite town of Wellington since the Remutaka rail tunnel opened in 1955; at the 2006 census, 36% of employed Featherston residents worked in Wellington and the Hutt Valley. This proximity to the capital, coupled with low house prices, made Featherston popular with writers, artists and those with young families, in turn leading to a recent upsurge in business investment and creative activity. From 2014 to 2019, housing prices in Featherston increased by 108% while rental prices went from an average of $140 to $400 in the same time period. 

==History==
Wairarapa Moana (Lake Wairarapa) was among the first areas settled in New Zealand, with sites dating back some 800 years. Fish and waterfowl were plentiful, but the major draw card was tuna – the native freshwater eel. Tuna could be caught in vast quantities during their seasonal migration to the sea, and the catch could be dried for storage or trading. Seasonal eeling settlements dotted the edge of Wairarapa Moana, with several permanent settlements on the surrounding higher ground.

The town of Featherston was first known as Burlings, after Henry Burling, who opened an accommodation house near the Māori settlement of Pae-O-Tu-Mokai in 1847. In 1856, the provincial government surveyed the spot for a town, naming it after its superintendent, Isaac Featherston.

The Featherston Military Camp was a major training camp in World War I, established in 1916 and housing up to 8000 men. The camp was larger than the town and included 16 dining halls, six cookhouses, 17 shops, a picture theatre, a hospital, and a post office. After training, infantrymen marched over the Remutaka Range for embarkation at Wellington.

During World War II, in 1942 it became the Featherston prisoner of war camp, holding 800 Japanese POWs captured in the South Pacific. On 25 February 1943, an incident occurred where 122 Japanese Prisoners of War in the camp were shot (48 dead, 74 wounded). Tension had been building for weeks before a group of recently arrived prisoners staged a sit-down strike and refused to work. Guards fired a warning shot, wounding Lieutenant Adachi Toshio. The prisoners then rose, and the guards opened fire. Wartime censors kept details of the incident quiet to prevent Japanese reprisals against Allied POWs. After the war, the first POW to return to Featherston burned incense at the site in 1974 and a joint New Zealand–Japanese project established a memorial ground, located 2 km north of the town on State Highway 2.

Featherston houses the world&#x27;s only surviving Fell locomotive engine in the Fell Locomotive Museum. The locomotive system operated successfully for 77 years from 1878 to 1955. Remnants of the trains and the once busy settlement are visible on the Remutaka Rail Trail Cycleway.
