<text>Portorož (; ) is a Slovenian Adriatic seaside resort and spa settlement located in the Municipality of Piran in southwestern Slovenia. Its modern development began in the late 19th century with the vogue for the first health resorts. In the early 20th century Portorož became one of the grandest seaside resorts in the Adriatic, along with Opatija, Lido and Grado, then as part of the Austrian Littoral. It is now one of Slovenia&#x27;s major tourist areas. Located in the centre is the Palace Hotel, once one of the most important resorts for the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and currently one of the finest hotels between Venice and Dubrovnik.

The settlement and its surrounding areas are served by Portorož International Airport which is located in the nearby village of Sečovlje.

==Name==
The Slovene name &quot;Portorož&quot; is borrowed from Italian &quot;Portorose&quot;, literally &#x27;port of roses&#x27;, which was recorded in the 12th century as &quot;Porto di rose&quot;. The name is derived from &quot;Santa Maria delle Rose&quot; &#x27;St. Mary of the Roses&#x27;, the patron saint of a former church in the settlement.

== History ==

The history of the settlement is directly connected to that of the neighbouring town of Piran, with Illyrian settlers already living there in the prehistoric era. They were followed by Celtic tribes, which were later conquered and annexed by the Roman Empire in 178 B.C. Archaeological finds suggest that in this period many farms and villas, also named &quot;villae rusticae&quot;, were built in the area. A large development of the area followed only after the demise of the empire, with enlargement of the number of settlers seeking shelter from attacks by the Barbarians.

In the 7th century, the area was a part of the Byzantine Empire. Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the feudal rule, as well as the rising power of the Venetian Republic, the settlement of Pirano signed a trade treaty with Venice, which included a lesser degree of autonomy.
One of the first religious orders who came to this area was the Benedictines. 
In the 12th century, the broader region already had four monasteries and even more churches. Among those, one of the oldest was the church of &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot;, which stood by the bay in the beginnings of the 13th century. Its name was &quot;Sancta Maria Roxe&quot; or &quot;S. Maria delle Rose&quot;, and in 1251 the bay was named by it &quot;Portus sanctae Mariae de Rosa&quot;.

One of the most important roles in the history of the settlement was the monastery of Saint Laurence, where the Benedictines healed rheumatic illnesses, ascites and other diseases with concentrated saltwater and saline mud. In 1210, the area was overtaken by the Patriarchy of Aquileia.

In the 13th century, Pirano entered a brief war from December 1282 to January 1283, in which it was defeated by the Venetian Republic. 

During the second Venetian rule, it was, contrary to other towns on the Istrian peninsula, loyal to Venetian rule, and as such gained special privileges within the republic, which in turn caused the local economy to boom. In 1797, Venetian rule came to a close as the Austrian Empire took over the area for a brief period until 1806. From 1806 to 1813, the entire Istrian Peninsula became part of the Illyrian Provinces.

A period of economic growth followed during the second Austrian rule, with enlargement of trade and locally important salt pans in nearby Lucija and Sečovlje. In the aftermath of the Great War, the Treaty of Rapallo determined the Istrian peninsula to be from that point on a part of the Kingdom of Italy.

Under the royal and then fascist rule, the area found itself amidst economic decline and civil conflicts between the populace and the state. In World War II, the area had not seen much action, although the important industrial hub of Trieste suffered multiple bombings. In the aftermath of the war, the settlement found itself in the United Nations-administered Free Territory of Trieste. After the dissolution of the Trieste state it became a part of Yugoslavia.

== Economy ==

The economy of Portorož is mainly based on tourism and the gambling industry. The facilities include a marina, numerous sporting facilities and several casinos, along with many hotels and apartment complexes.

===Tourism development===
In the second half of the 19th century, the leaders of the Pirano municipality and local doctors decided to stimulate tourism in the region, by offering health treatment by concentrated salt water and salina mud. From 1879 onward, Giovanni Lugnano was first to offer such salt treatments to various visitors.

In 1885, after several years of successful start of new spa salt treatments, constructions of new treatment complexes and private villas began, and, in 1890, the predecessor of the famous Hotel Palace was built.

In 1908, Orazio Pupini, a prominent Austrian doctor with a notable treatment history opened a sanatorium. He was also the main doctor of the Austrian Railways, and a member of the Austrian Doctors&#x27; Association. In 1902, the Parenzana railway system was introduced which increased the popularity of the region, but was later dissolved because of decreased spa interests. In 1909, the era of construction of most private villas ended with opening of a much bigger building for accommodation standards at the time; the &quot;Palace Cur Hotel&quot;, later known as the Palace Hotel. At the initial opening ceremony, in 1910, the Palace Hotel was named &quot;the most beautiful hotel on the Adriatic coast&quot;. The hotel was equipped with the most modern therapeutic accessories, and a casino was built for important wealthy guests.

The thriving tourist community was halted by World War I, and a few years after the war (in which they came under Italian rule) in 1928 they included a new electric therapy among their treatment programmes. In the interwar period the settlement was slowly regaining its former glory when World War II severely crippled it again. The crisis lasted until 1968 when renovations and new constructions under the new entity of Yugoslavia began to take place along the whole region. In this time they began to build the settlement&#x27;s infrastructure with the casino doing the bulk of the investments in reconstructing the sports airfield in nearby Sečovlje and building the multi-purpose auditorium in 1972.

In 1976, two hotel complexes were constructed in Bernardin; in the following year another was added in the same area. In the same year they began transforming the Lucija saltworks into a marina for smaller vessels. Since the separation of Slovenia from Yugoslavia, Portorož has become one of the most important tourist sites in the country.
===Gambling===
The first casino to be opened was in Villa San Lorenzo, on 27 July 1913, and was run by the &quot;Casino des Etrangers&quot; society. It only lasted a few months before being shut down.

The industry faded away in the northern Adriatic region, until 1963, when &quot;Zavod za pospeševanje turizma&quot;, whose president was Anton Nino Spinelli, proposed a reopening of the casino. The next year the first casino in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, and the second within Yugoslavia other than the one in Opatija, Croatia.

In 1972, the company moved into the newly built and much larger Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol, where they employed around 450 people. Having a large budget surplus, they began investing in the settlement&#x27;s infrastructure.
Today there are multiple casinos located in Portorož, such as the Casino Riviera, Grand Casino Portorož, and the Casino Bernardin, located in the Grand Hotel Emona complex, which includes the Hotel Villa Park.

===Bernardin===
Bernardin is a tourist complex located in the western part of Portorož. Its name derives from &quot;sveti Bernardin&quot; (&quot;Saint Bernardino&quot;), as the church, now in ruins, was named. Before the construction of multiple complexes, the area was a shipyard for smaller vessels, later moved to the town of Izola.
In 1971, Emona company from Ljubljana established Hoteli Bernardin, and began working on building the complex. In 1976, the first two hotels, Bernardin and Vile Park were built, with Grand hotel Emona following the next year.

The monastery associated with Saint Bernardino&#x27;s Church, which was built in 1452, was closed in 1806. In 1830, the Austrian military converted the structure into a fortress to guard the Bay of Piran, after which the buildings started to deteriorate.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===

Portorož belongs to the coastal municipality of Piran, located in the southwest of the Gulf of Trieste (at the northernmost point of the Adriatic Sea) between the boundaries of Italy to the north and Croatia to the south. Part of Portorož are the streets Fiesa and Pacug. In the southern part near the salt pans there are some old salt warehouses, on the hill of Crocebianca (Beli Križ), there is a viewpoint over the Portorož bay and the Radio Capodistria antenna.

===Climate===
Portorož has humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with cool winters and warm summers. Winters are cool with a January average of while summers are warm with a July high of and a low of . Due to its coastal location, temperatures below or above are rare. The average annual precipitation is 
 which is fairly distributed throughout the year, though September and October see a peak in precipitation levels. Portorož averages 2,423 hours of sunshine per year.

==Arts==

Portorož hosts the annual Festival of Slovenian Film (&quot;Festival slovenskega filma&quot;), with &quot;Vesna&quot; awards being awarded for the best achievements in Slovenian cinematography.

Since 1961, Portorož has also hosted a contemporary art biennale, the International Forma Viva Sculpture Workshop. The works are on display in a sculpture park above the village of Seča.

The settlement is also home to The Rolling Stones Museum, one of the most unique ones of its type in the world.
==Sports==
Portorož was a home of the Banka Koper Slovenia Open tennis tournament of WTA Tour from 2005 to 2010. Since 2013 the Tilia Slovenia Open, a men&#x27;s ATP Challenger tournament, takes place every summer on the same courts of the ŠRC Marina.

In 1958, the Portorož international chess tournament was won by Mikhail Tal; Bobby Fischer finished sixth, and was awarded the title of grandmaster at the (then) record age of 15. Tal went on subsequently to win the candidates tournament and the world title of 1960. 
Portorož was host to the International Physics Olympiad in 1985 and the European Universities Debating Championships in 2001.

In 2008, the new Euro-Mediterranean University of Slovenia was inaugurated in collaboration with universities of the EU, the Middle East, and North Africa.

In 2023, Portorož will host the European Girls&#x27; Mathematical Olympiad.

<doc id="956675" wikidata="Q1754095" url="?curid=956675" title="Parallel RAM">
<text>In computer science, a parallel random-access machine (parallel RAM or PRAM) is a shared-memory abstract machine. As its name indicates, the PRAM is intended as the parallel-computing analogy to the random-access machine (RAM) (not to be confused with random-access memory). In the same way that the RAM is used by sequential-algorithm designers to model algorithmic performance (such as time complexity), the PRAM is used by parallel-algorithm designers to model parallel algorithmic performance (such as time complexity, where the number of processors assumed is typically also stated). Similar to the way in which the RAM model neglects practical issues, such as access time to cache memory versus main memory, the PRAM model neglects such issues as synchronization and communication, but provides any (problem-size-dependent) number of processors. Algorithm cost, for instance, is estimated using two parameters O(time) and O(time × processor_number).

==Read/write conflicts==
Read/write conflicts, commonly termed interlocking in accessing the same shared memory location simultaneously are resolved by one of the following strategies:

#Exclusive read exclusive write (EREW)—every memory cell can be read or written to by only one processor at a time
#Concurrent read exclusive write (CREW)—multiple processors can read a memory cell but only one can write at a time
#Exclusive read concurrent write (ERCW)—mostly never considered because it mostly doesn&#x27;t add more power
#Concurrent read concurrent write (CRCW)—multiple processors can read and write. A CRCW PRAM is sometimes called a concurrent random-access machine.

Here, E and C stand for &#x27;exclusive&#x27; and &#x27;concurrent&#x27; respectively. The read causes no discrepancies while the concurrent write is further defined as:
::&quot;Common&quot;—all processors write the same value; otherwise is illegal
::&quot;Arbitrary&quot;—only one arbitrary attempt is successful, others retire
::&quot;Priority&quot;—processor rank indicates who gets to write
::Another kind of &quot;array reduction&quot; operation like SUM, Logical AND or MAX.

Several simplifying assumptions are made while considering the development of algorithms for PRAM. They are:
# There is no limit on the number of processors in the machine.
# Any memory location is uniformly accessible from any processor.
# There is no limit on the amount of shared memory in the system.
# Resource contention is absent.
# The programs written on these machines are, in general, of type SIMD.

These kinds of algorithms are useful for understanding the exploitation of concurrency, dividing the original problem into similar sub-problems and solving them in parallel. The introduction of the formal &#x27;P-RAM&#x27; model in Wyllie&#x27;s 1979 thesis had the aim of quantifying analysis of parallel algorithms in a way analogous to the Turing Machine. The analysis focused on a MIMD model of programming using a CREW model but showed that many variants, including implementing a CRCW model and implementing on an SIMD machine, were possible with only constant overhead.

==Implementation==
PRAM algorithms cannot be parallelized with the combination of CPU and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) because DRAM does not allow concurrent access to a single bank (not even different addresses in the bank); but they can be implemented in hardware or read/write to the internal static random-access memory (SRAM) blocks of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), it can be done using a CRCW algorithm.

However, the test for practical relevance of PRAM (or RAM) algorithms depends on whether their cost model provides an effective abstraction of some computer; the structure of that computer can be quite different than the abstract model. The knowledge of the layers of software and hardware that need to be inserted is beyond the scope of this article. But, articles such as demonstrate how a PRAM-like abstraction can be supported by the explicit multi-threading (XMT) paradigm and articles such as demonstrate that a PRAM algorithm for the maximum flow problem can provide strong speedups relative to the fastest serial program for the same problem. The article demonstrated that PRAM algorithms as-is can achieve competitive performance even without any additional effort to cast them as multi-threaded programs on XMT.

==Example code==
This is an example of SystemVerilog code which finds the maximum value in the array in only 2 clock cycles. It compares all the combinations of the elements in the array at the first clock, and merges the result at the second clock. It uses CRCW memory; codice_1 and codice_2 are written concurrently. The concurrency causes no conflicts because the algorithm guarantees that the same value is written to the same memory. This code can be run on FPGA hardware.

<text>In music, a serenade (; also sometimes called a serenata, from the Italian) is a musical composition or performance delivered in honour of someone or something. Serenades are typically calm, light pieces of music. The term comes from the Italian word , which itself derives from the Latin . Sense influenced by Italian &quot;sera&quot; &quot;evening&quot;, from Latin &quot;sera&quot;, fem. of &quot;serus&quot; &quot;late&quot;.

==Early serenade music==

In the oldest usage, which survives in informal form to the present day, a serenade is a musical greeting performed for a lover, friend, person of rank or other person to be honored. The classic usage would be from a lover to his lady love through a window. It was considered an evening piece, one to be performed on a quiet and pleasant evening, as opposed to an aubade, which would be performed in the morning. The custom of serenading in this manner began in the Medieval era, and the word &quot;serenade&quot; as commonly used in current English is related to this custom. Music performed followed no one particular form, except that it was typically sung by one person accompanying himself on a portable instrument, most likely a guitar, lute or other plucked instrument. Works of this type also appeared in later eras, but usually in a context that referred specifically to a past time, such as arias in an opera (there is a famous example in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;). Carl Maria von Weber composed his serenade for voice and guitar, &quot;Horch&#x27;! Leise horch&#x27;, Geliebte!&quot; (1809).

==Baroque era==

In the Baroque era, a serenata—as the form was called since it occurred most frequently in Italy and Vienna—was a typically celebratory or eulogistic dramatic cantata for two or more singers and orchestra, performed outdoors in the evening by artificial light. Some composers of this type of serenade include Alessandro Stradella, Alessandro Scarlatti, Johann Joseph Fux, Johann Mattheson, and Antonio Caldara. Often these were large-scale works performed with minimal staging, intermediate between a &quot;cantata&quot; and an opera. The main difference between a &quot;cantata&quot; and a serenata, around 1700, was that the &quot;serenata&quot; was performed outdoors and therefore could use instruments which would be too loud in a small room (for example, trumpets, horns, and drums).

==Classical and Romantic eras==
The most important and prevalent type of serenade in music history is a work for large instrumental ensemble in multiple movements, related to the divertimento, and mainly being composed in the Classical and Romantic periods, though a few examples exist from the 20th century. Usually the character of the work is lighter than other multiple-movement works for large ensemble (for example the symphony), with tunefulness being more important than thematic development or dramatic intensity. Most of these works are from Italy, Germany, Austria and Bohemia.

Among the most famous examples of the serenade from the 18th century are those by Mozart, whose serenades typically comprise between four and ten movements. His serenades were often purely instrumental pieces, written for special occasions such as those commissioned for wedding ceremonies. Famous serenades by Mozart include the &quot;Haffner&quot; &quot;Serenade&quot;, &quot;Serenade No. 10 for winds&quot; commonly known as &quot;Gran Partita&quot;, the &quot;Serenata notturna&quot;, and one of his most famous works, &quot;Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.&quot; The last two of these, had they been written earlier in the century, would have been atypical for using only string instruments.

By the 19th century, the serenade had transformed into a concert work, and was less associated with outdoor performance for honorary occasions. Composers began to write serenades for other ensembles. The two serenades by Brahms are rather like light symphonies, perhaps more closely related to suites, except that they use an ensemble such as Mozart would have recognized: a small orchestra (in the case of the Serenade No. 2, an orchestra entirely without violins). Dvořák, Tchaikovsky, Josef Suk, Edward Elgar, and others wrote serenades for strings only, see Serenade for Strings (Dvořák), Serenade for Strings (Tchaikovsky), Serenade for Strings (Suk), and Serenade for Strings (Elgar), as did Hugo Wolf, who wrote one for string quartet (the &quot;Italian Serenade&quot;). Other composers to write serenades in a Romantic style include Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert, Richard Strauss, Max Reger, Ethel Smyth, Wilhelm Stenhammar and Jean Sibelius (see Two Serenades (Sibelius)).

==20th century==
Some examples of serenades in the 20th century include the &quot;Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings&quot; by Benjamin Britten, the Serenade in A for piano by Stravinsky, the Serenade for baritone and septet, Op. 24 by Arnold Schoenberg, and the movement entitled &quot;Serenade&quot; in Shostakovich&#x27;s last string quartet, No. 15 (1974). Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote a &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; (for 16 solo voices and orchestra) that premiered in 1938, while Leonard Bernstein composed his &quot;Serenade after Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;&quot; (for solo violin, strings harp and percussion) in 1954. These modern serenades are freely explored adaptations to the serenade&#x27;s original formal layout and instrumentation. A modern play on serenading is using a boombox to play music. One notable example is in the 1989 movie &quot;Say Anything&quot; when John Cusack&#x27;s character Lloyd plays &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Peter Gabriel under his love interest&#x27;s open bedroom window.

A serenade is commonly of a multi-movement structure, ranging anywhere from four to up to ten movements. They usually are constructed with a fast opening movement, followed by middle slow movements that alternate with fast ones and close with a fast presto or allegro movement. There are strong influences from chamber music, and serenades can be subtly inserted into a chamber music program. A serenade can be considered somewhere in between a suite and a symphony, but is usually of a light and romantic nature — casual and without too many overly dramatic moments.

<doc id="956689" wikidata="Q169349" url="?curid=956689" title="Kura–Araxes culture">
<text>The Kura–Araxes culture (also named &quot;Kur–Araz culture, Mtkvari–Araxes culture, Early Transcaucasian culture, Shengavitian culture&quot;) was an archaeological culture that existed from about 4000 BC until about 2000 BC, which has traditionally been regarded as the date of its end; in some locations it may have disappeared as early as 2600 or 2700 BC. The earliest evidence for this culture is found on the Ararat plain; it spread north in the Caucasus by 3000 BC.

Altogether, the early Transcaucasian culture enveloped a vast area approximately 1,000 km by 500 km, and mostly encompassed the modern-day territories of the South Caucasus (except western Georgia), northwestern Iran, the northeastern Caucasus, eastern Turkey, and as far as northern Syria.

The name of the culture is derived from the Kura and Araxes river valleys. Some local variations of the Kura–Araxes culture are sometimes known as Shengavitian, Karaz (Erzurum), Pulur (after a site renamed later as Sakyol), and Yanik Tepe (Iranian Azerbaijan, near Lake Urmia) cultures. It gave rise to the Khirbet Kerak-ware culture found in the Levant and Trialeti culture of the South Caucasus and Armenian Highlands. In Nakhchivan region and nearby areas, Kura-Araxes culture was followed by Nakhchivan culture.

This civilization was characterized by an agricultural sedentary economy with more than a thousand settlements covering the fertile riverside valleys, high plateaus and high mountain zones of the Armenian highlands and neighboring regions. The Early Bronze Age artificial hill-settlements were characterized by multiple cultural layers, which in some places spread to tens of meters (Mokhrablur of Nakhijevan, Norsun-Tepe).

== Genetics ==

Ancient DNA analysis has provided insights into the genetic composition of individuals associated with the Kura-Araxes culture. The Y-chromosome haplogroups identified in Kura-Araxes individuals include G2b, J-CTS1460 (x2), J-Z1842, and R1b1-M415 (xM269), reflecting a mixture of lineages with deep Near Eastern and Caucasian origins. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis indicates diverse maternal lineages, with haplogroups including H, H1u, K3, N1b1a, R1a1, T2a1b2b, T2h, U1a1a, U3a2, U3b1a1, U3b2, and X2f. These haplogroups suggest genetic connections between Kura-Araxes populations and neighboring regions such as Anatolia, the Near East, and the Caucasus. Genomic studies indicate that Kura-Araxes individuals shared a significant portion of their ancestry with Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers (CHG) and Anatolian Chalcolithic populations. The data indicate a largely stable genetic profile over time, with limited gene flow from Steppe populations, distinguishing them from later Bronze Age groups that incorporated more Yamnaya-related ancestry.

== Early history ==

The formative processes of the Kura-Araxes cultural complex, and the date and circumstances of its rise, have been long debated.

Shulaveri-Shomu culture preceded the Kura–Araxes culture in the area. There were many differences between these two cultures, so the connection was not clear. Later, it was suggested that the Sioni culture of eastern Georgia possibly represented a transition from the Shulaveri to the Kura-Arax cultural complex.

At many sites, the Sioni culture layers can be seen as intermediary between Shulaver-Shomu-Tepe layers and the Kura-Araxes layers. This kind of stratigraphy warrants a chronological place of the Sioni culture at around 4000 BCE.

Some scholars consider the Kartli and Kakheti areas as key to forming the earliest phase of the Kura–Araxes culture. To a large extent, this appears as an indigenous culture of Caucasus that was formed over a long period, and at the same time incorporating foreign influences.

There are some indications (such as at Arslantepe) of the overlapping in time of the Kura-Araxes and Uruk cultures; such contacts may go back even to the Middle Uruk period.

Some scholars have suggested that the earliest manifestation of the Kura-Araxes phenomenon should be dated at least to the last quarter of the 5th millennium BC. This is based on the recent data from Ovçular Tepesi, a Late Chalcolithic settlement located in Nakhchivan by the Arpaçay river.
== Expansion ==
Rather quickly, elements of Kura–Araxes culture started to proceed westward to the Erzurum plain, southwest to Cilicia, and to the southeast into the area of Lake Van, and below the Urmia basin in Iran, such as to Godin Tepe. Finally, it proceeded into the present-day Syria (Amuq valley), and as far as Israel.

Its territory corresponds to large parts of modern Armenia, Azerbaijan, Chechnya, Dagestan, Georgia, Ingushetia, North Ossetia, and parts of Iran and Turkey.

At Sos Hoyuk, in Erzurum Province, Turkey, early forms of Kura-Araxes pottery were found in association with local ceramics as early as 3500-3300 BC. During the Early Bronze Age in 3000-2200 BC, this settlement was part of the Kura-Araxes phenomenon.

At Arslantepe, Turkey, around 3000 BCE, there was widespread burning and destruction, after which Kura-Araxes pottery appeared in the area.

According to Geoffrey Summers, the movement of Kura-Araxes peoples into Iran and the Van region, which he interprets as quite sudden, started shortly before 3000 BC, and may have been prompted by the &#x27;Late Uruk Collapse&#x27; (end of the Uruk period), taking place at the end of Uruk IV phase .

=== Iranian sites ===
There are many important Kura-Araxes sites located along the Araxes river, south of which is modern Iran. Kultepe, Azerbaijan, in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic close to Araxes river, has already been known for a long time. In Iran, the excavations especially accelerated in the 21st century. Kul Tepe Jolfa, a related site, is seen as an important gateway for Kura-Araxes culture on its way south towards Lake Urmia area. Ancient obsidian trade and distribution are particularly revealing of cultural connections, and Kul Tepe Jolfa was an important transshipment point for the movement of Caucasian obsidian to Iranian sites. This trade was probably conducted by groups of mobile pastoralists from Iran.

Also in Iran downstream the Araxes river, two additional sites from the same period have recently been excavated, Kohne Pasgah and Kohne Tepesi.

Many other Iranian sites have come to light recently and have been excavated already.

== Cultural connections ==

Kura–Araxes culture is closely linked to the approximately contemporaneous Maykop culture of the North Caucasus. The two cultures seem to have influenced one another.

===Economy===
The economy was based on farming and livestock-raising (especially of cattle and sheep). They grew grain and orchard crops, and are known to have used implements to make flour. They raised cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, and in later phases, horses.

Before the Kura-Araxes period, horse bones were not found in Transcaucasia. Later, beginning about 3300 BCE, they became widespread, with signs of domestication.

There is evidence of trade with Mesopotamia as well as Asia Minor. It is, however, considered above all to be indigenous to the Caucasus, and its major variants characterized (according to Caucasus historian Amjad Jaimoukha) later major cultures in the region.

It was at this period that the irrigation systems built on the slopes of the Aragats and Geghama mountains were formed and at the sources of canals, artificial water pools and springs, dragon stones (vishapakar) made from one piece basalt were erected. Another prerequisite for unprecedented economic development was copper production. A large number of weapon and tools made of arsenical bronze are attested by both the finds near Yerevan and the stone and clay molds found in various ancient sites of Shengavit civilization (Shengavit, Margahovit, etc.). In the Shengavit ancient site, weight standards similar to those used in the Levant were found, which testify to Armenia&#x27;s involvement in the newly formed international trade relations in the Early Bronze Age. The weapons that were found were arrows, daggers, battle axes, spears and other weapons made of obsidian, flint, bone and bronze.

=== Settlements ===
Archaeological evidence of inhabitants of the Kura–Araxes culture showed that ancient settlements were found along the Hrazdan river, as shown by drawings at a mountainous area in a cave nearby. Structures in settlements have not revealed much differentiation, nor was there much difference in size or character between settlements, facts that suggest they probably had a poorly developed social hierarchy for a significant stretch of their history. Some, but not all, settlements were surrounded by stone walls. Among the settlements with an area of 1-10 ha, the central ones were surrounded by fortified walls built of stone (Shengavit,
Garni, Persi, Khorenia-Javakhk) and of mud-brick (Mokhrablur, Goy-tepe, Gudaberteke), with artificial puddles (Norabats, Kvatskhelebi, Khizannat-gora). The Shengavit fortified wall is noteworthy with its stone foundations, reinforced with rectangular masonry walls and a tiled secret passage leading to Hrazdan river. The central urban areas, which are characterized by dense construction (Shengavit, Mokhrablur, etc.), were surrounded by satellite residences. 

The Kura-Araxes built mud-brick houses, originally round, but later developing into subrectangular designs with structures of just one or two rooms, multiple rooms centered around an open space, or rectilinear designs. The mud-brick was made from sandy clay with the help of mold forms and dried in the sun. It was the main building material from which 10 to 11 walls, temples, residential and economic buildings and hydro-engineering structures were built. The foundations of the houses were made of river stones, cracked or unprocessed basalt (Shengavit, Harich, Karaz, Amiranis-gora, etc.), on which mud-brick walls were raised. Round buildings with a diameter of 4-10 m and rectangular floorplan were widespread. The latter had a flat, log roof, and the buildings with round floorplan had primitive roofs of “hazarashen” type, covered with clay mud-bricks with reed, with a skylights hole in the centre of the roof, that solved the issues of light and ventilation of the house (Shengavit, Mokhrablur). The floors were of rammed earth. There were also plaster covered, up to 10 cm thick (Shengavit) and red painted (Garakepek-Tepe) floors. There are found samples of attempts to enliven the monotonous clay walls with decoration and with shaped arrangement of bricks of different color and to enlighten the monotonous appearance of the walls with various colors (Shengavit, Mokhrablur in Nakhijevan, Yanik-tepe, etc).

At some point the culture&#x27;s settlements and burial grounds expanded out of lowland river valleys and into highland areas. Although some scholars have suggested that this expansion demonstrates a switch from agriculture to pastoralism and that it serves as possible proof of a large-scale arrival of Indo-Europeans, facts such as that settlement in the lowlands remained more or less continuous suggest merely that the people of this culture were diversifying their economy to encompass crop and livestock agriculture.

Shengavit Settlement is a prominent Kura-Araxes site in present-day Yerevan area in Armenia. It was inhabited from approximately 3200 BC cal to 2500 BC cal. Later on, in the Middle Bronze Age, it was used irregularly until 2200 BC cal. The town occupied an area of six hectares, which is large for Kura-Araxes sites.

===Metallurgy===
In the earliest phase of the Kura–Araxes culture, metal was scarce. In comparison, the preceding Leilatepe culture&#x27;s metalwork tradition was far more sophisticated. Especially after 3000 BC, a significant increase in the use of metal objects occurred at Kura-Araxes sites. Also the variation in copper alloys increased during this time. The rich tomb of a woman at Kvazchela is a good example of this, which is quite similar to the &#x27;royal tomb&#x27; from Arslantepe. The use of an arsenical component up to 25% in copper objects resulted in a shiny greyish, silvery colour. So it&#x27;s quite possible that these unusually high arsenical alloys were intended to imitate silver.

The Kura–Araxes culture would later display &quot;a precocious metallurgical development, which strongly influenced surrounding regions&quot;. They worked copper, arsenic, silver, gold, tin, and bronze.

Their metal goods were widely distributed, from the Volga, Dnieper and Don-Donets river systems in the north to Syria and Palestine in the south and Anatolia in the west.

===Pottery===
Their pottery was distinctive. The spread of their pottery along trade routes into surrounding cultures was much more impressive than any of their achievements domestically. It was painted black and red, using geometric designs. Examples have been found as far south as Syria and Israel, and as far north as Dagestan and Chechnya. The spread of this pottery, along with archaeological evidence of invasions, suggests that the Kura-Araxes people may have spread outward from their original homes and, most certainly, had extensive trade contacts. Jaimoukha believes that its southern expanse is attributable primarily to Mitanni and the Hurrians.

According to Giulio Palumbi (2008), the typical red-black ware of Kura–Araxes culture originated in eastern Anatolia, and then moved on to the Caucasus area. But then these cultural influences came back to Anatolia mixed in with other cultural elements from the Caucasus.

Köhne Shahar is a very large Kura-Araxes archaeological site in Iran located close to the Turkish border. Situated in a narrow valley at the altitude of 1905m asl, it was excavated in 2012-2014. It was located on the trade route between Iran and Anatolia.

===Viticulture===
Viticulture and wine-making were widely practised in the area from the earliest times. Viticulture even goes back to the earlier Shulaveri-Shomu culture.

The earliest evidence of domesticated grapes in the world has been found at Gadachrili Gora, near the village of Imiri, Marneuli Municipality, in southeastern Republic of Georgia; carbon-dating points to the date of about 6000 BC.

Grape pips dating back to the V-IVth millennia BC were found in Shulaveri; others dating back to the IVth millennium BC were found in Khizanaant Gora—all in this same &#x27;Shulaveri area&#x27; of the Republic of Georgia.

A theory has been suggested by Stephen Batiuk that the Kura-Araxes folk may have spread &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; vine and wine technology to the &quot;Fertile Crescent&quot;—to Mesopotamia and the Eastern Mediterranean. The spread of the wine-goblet form, such as represented by the Khirbet Kerak ware, is clearly associated with these peoples. The same applies to the large ceramic vessels used for grape fermentation.

===Religion===
The bearers of the Shengavit culture had a complex religious system. In the central part of the Mokhrablur settlement III construction horizon, a volume-spatial creation was uncovered: a structure-tower with a rectangular plan (7,4x5,5 m) constructed with hard tuff, in the eastern part of which a 3,9 m long one-piece basalt altar was placed. Near this stone structure, clay buildings and ash pits were uncovered, in which the ashes of the sacred hearths had been accumulated. Many tufa idols and clay hearths were excavated in the Shengavit settlement.

In 2012 year, a complex cult system was excavated-a room with a rectangular plan, designed specifically for ritual ceremonies, inside which a clay altar decorated with relief ornaments on its front was uncovered. A statue of an idol was affixed into the altar and goblets for libation were placed in front of the heart. To the right from the stairs, leading to the semi-subterranean room of the shrine, two clay–packed basins were found, in which the ashes from sacred fires were kept. A phallic pendant-idol was found in the shrine, which was the identifying symbol of the priestess. The adjacent room of the complex reflects household activities of the time. A similar cultic complex was found at the ancient site of Pulur (Sakyol). At the inside of the religious structures, terracotta cult hearths that were unique to the Shengavit culture were located in the altars front. They had diameters of up to one meter, with the edges of the inner space resembling a ship bow divided into three parts, with the upper platforms were red-painted and decorated with geometric figures. Statuettes of women and men and worshiped animals like horses, bulls and rams were found near these hearths. The horseshoe-shaped mobile shrines with ram protomes, threelegged pedestals, phallus-shaped pendant figures were also of religious nature.
===Burial customs===
One of the spheres of religious practice was the burial ritual. Outside the settlements, burial grounds were formed in their immediate vicinity. Both individual tombs with earthen and tiled walls, as well as wide ancestral tombs with stone walls were revealed, in which the deceased (Joghaz) of the upper-class family were sequentially buried. In the final stage of this civilization, collective burials were performed, which included human sacrifices. These tombs contain numerous artifacts that indications of social stratification: gold and silver jewelry, bronze tools and weapons, imported valuable items.

Inhumation practices are mixed. Flat graves are found but so are substantial kurgan burials, the latter of which may be surrounded by dolmen. This points to a heterogeneous ethno-linguistic population (see section below).

Analyzing the situation in the Kura-Araxes period, T. A. Akhundov notes the lack of unity in funerary monuments, which he considers more than strange in the framework of a single culture; for the funeral rites reflect the deep culture-forming foundations and are weakly influenced by external customs. There are non-kurgan and kurgan burials, burials in ground pits, in stone boxes and crypts, in the underlying ground strata and on top of them; using both the round and rectangular burials; there are also substantial differences in the typical corpse position. Burial complexes of Kura–Araxes culture sometimes also include cremation.

Here one can come to the conclusion that the Kura–Araxes culture developed gradually through a synthesis of several cultural traditions, including the ancient cultures of the Caucasus and nearby territories.

Late Kura-Araxes sites often featured Kurgans of greatly varying sizes, with larger, wealthier kurgans surrounded by smaller kurgans containing less wealth. These kurgans also contained a wide assortment metalworks. This trend suggests the eventual emergence of a marked social hierarchy. Their practice of storing relatively great wealth in burial kurgans was probably a cultural influence from the more ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent to the south.

In the 3rd millennium B.C., one particular group of mounds of the Kura–Araxes culture is remarkable for their wealth. This was the final stage of culture&#x27;s development. These burial mounds are known as the Martqopi (or Martkopi) period mounds. Those on the left bank of the river Alazani are often 20–25 meters high and 200–300 meters in diameter. They contain especially rich artefacts, such as gold and silver jewelry.

== Ethno-linguistic makeup ==
While it is unknown what languages were present in Kura-Araxes, the two most widespread theories suggest a connection with Hurro-Urartian and/or Anatolian languages. The Kartvelian and Northeast Caucasian languages were likely spoken in the region as well.

<text>Thomas Patrick Barrasso (born March 31, 1965) is an American professional ice hockey coach and former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 18 seasons. Barrasso began his time in the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres, who selected him fifth overall in the 1983 NHL Entry Draft out of high school. He was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1988, where he would best be remembered and spend the majority of his career. Barrasso spent parts of 12 seasons with the Penguins, and was a Stanley Cup champion in 1991 and 1992. After being traded to the Ottawa Senators in March 2000 and sitting out the 2000–01 season, his final two seasons were split playing for the Carolina Hurricanes, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues. Barrasso was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 2009 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2023.

After retiring as a player, Barrasso served on the coaching staff of the NHL&#x27;s Carolina Hurricanes. In 2012, Barrasso was hired by Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) as a member of its coaching staff. In 2016, he joined Asiago Hockey of the Alps Hockey League as their head coach, winning the 2017–18 league championship. In October 2018, Barrasso was hired as head coach of the EIHL&#x27;s Sheffield Steelers.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Barrasso grew up in the town of Stow, Massachusetts, playing ice hockey on an outdoor rink. He started playing goaltender at the age of five years and by the time he was a teenager, was playing in net for Acton-Boxborough with fellow NHL players Bob Sweeney and Jeff Norton, as well as fellow goalie Kelly Dyer. Barrasso was considered one of the most promising American goaltending prospects of all time. He was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres with the fifth overall pick in 1983. Skipping a college career, he went straight from high school to the NHL. At the time of his debut with the Sabres on October 5, 1983, less than six months after graduating from high school, Barrasso was the youngest goaltender to play and win a game in the NHL since Harry Lumley nearly forty years prior. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy and Vezina Trophy in his first season, becoming the third player to win both awards in the same year.

===Pittsburgh Penguins===
On November 12, 1988, the Sabres traded Barrasso, with a third round draft pick in the 1990 draft (Joe Dziedzic) to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Doug Bodger and Darrin Shannon.

Barrasso won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1991 and 1992. It was his play in these Cup runs that established him as a &quot;money goalie&quot;. In the following years, Barrasso almost entirely missed two seasons, the 1994–95 NHL season and the 1996–97 NHL season with injuries but came back with good performances in the next years. In 1997, he became the first American goaltender to record 300 NHL wins. A fiercely proud competitor, in his later seasons in Pittsburgh he developed a strained relationship with the local media, who he felt were disrespectful of him and his family. This probably factors into why his #35 was not retired by the Penguins (current starting goaltender Tristan Jarry currently wears #35), as only Mario Lemieux&#x27;s, Michel Brière&#x27;s, and Jaromír Jágr&#x27;s jerseys are retired.

===Last years===
In March 2000, Barrasso was traded to the Ottawa Senators for Ron Tugnutt and Janne Laukkanen in a deal that was seen as a risk for both teams. He was uneven in Ottawa, going 3–4 in seven starts and losing the first two games of Ottawa&#x27;s first round series with rivals Toronto before bouncing back and winning the next two games to even the series. After evening the series, Barrasso caused a furor during the CBC&#x27;s broadcast when he said during an on-air interview on April 20 that he &quot;really couldn&#x27;t give a shit what you people have to say&quot;. Barrasso would apologize the next day for using vulgar language, although he stood by his sentiments in the interview, stating the year had been very stressful for him. The Senators would go on to lose the next two games and the series to the Maple Leafs in six games.

After his playoff run with Ottawa, Barrasso&#x27;s contract expired and he did not re-sign with the Senators. He then spent the entire 2000–01 season out of hockey to be with his family, following the cancer diagnosis of his daughter and death of his father from cancer. Following a favourable prognosis of his daughter&#x27;s condition and regaining mental clarity following what Barasso described as a difficult year in his personal life, Barasso returned to hockey signing a one-year contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 17, 2001, for the 2001–02 season. Barasso also enjoyed some international success this season, winning a Silver medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics playing for Team USA. Barasso expressed interest in playing with the Hurricanes following a June 2001 dinner with former Pittsburgh teammate Ron Francis, who had since joined Carolina.

Although Barasso had strong play in Carolina splitting the net with Artūrs Irbe, on March 14, 2002, he was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for Toronto&#x27;s fourth round pick in the 2003 NHL draft. He made his Toronto debut on March 21, in a 4–3 loss to the Washington Capitals. Ultimately, Barrasso would only appear in four games with Toronto, and not make a single post-season appearance, before Toronto was eliminated in the third round of the playoffs to the Hurricanes. Barrasso was not signed to a new contract following the Maple Leafs&#x27; elimination, becoming an unrestricted free agent.

Unsigned to a new deal in the NHL offseason, Barrasso began the season as a free agent before later signing a contract with the St. Louis Blues on November 4, 2002. Barrasso would only appear in 6 contests with the Blues between November 12 and 29, recording one win, before mutually agreeing with the team to release him from his contract on December 28. Unsigned for the rest of the season, Barrasso announced his retirement on June 19, 2003. He signed a &quot;pro forma&quot; contract with Pittsburgh on the day he declared retirement so he could leave hockey as a Penguin.

===Hockey Hall of Fame===

In 2023, Barrasso was named as an inductee to that year&#x27;s Hockey Hall of Fame class, to be formally inducted in November, after first being eligible for inclusion to the Hall in 2006. In the years following Barrasso&#x27;s retirement, he had frequently been cited as a worthy candidate, given his play and statistical accomplishments; however, Barrasso&#x27;s confrontational and rude personality (particularity with members of the media) had been noted as explanations for why Barrasso was not named to the Hall of Fame for 17 years. Barrasso&#x27;s public perception of having a difficult personality had existed since his playing days. When traded from Pittsburgh to Ottawa, Senators management received backlash from fans for acquiring Barrasso, with criticism directed to his personality and conflicts with teammates prior to the trade.

==International play==



Barrasso won an Olympic silver medal as part of the U.S. national men&#x27;s ice hockey team at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. He played in one game, an 8–1 victory over Belarus on February 18.

Barrasso had originally intended to play for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team in Sarajevo, but chose to begin his professional career instead and left the team in September 1983 to sign with the Sabres. He made his debut for Team USA at the 1984 Canada Cup, at the age of 19. He also played in the 1983 World Junior Championships, the 1986 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1987 Canada Cup.

==Coaching career==
Barrasso was goaltending coach (2007–09) and later assistant coach (2009–11) of the Carolina Hurricanes. In the 2012–13 season he moved to KHL&#x27;s Metallurg Magnitogorsk as assistant coach. During the Summer of 2015 Slovan Bratislava hired Barrasso as goaltending coach, but on October 31 he left the team and moved to Italy&#x27;s Valpellice as head coach. The team won the &quot;Coppa Italia&quot;, but refused to join the newly founded Alps Hockey League. Barrasso, however, did not leave Italy: he moved to Asiago as head coach. Barrasso was named as head coach of the Sheffield Steelers in the EIHL in October 2018.

On 26 June 2021, Barrasso was named as head coach of HC Varese in the IHL

On November 26, 2024, Tom Barrasso was announced as the new Head Coach of the Hannover Scorpions, an ice hockey team competing in Germany&#x27;s third-tier league. Based in Wedemark, Lower Saxony, the Scorpions aim to leverage Barrasso’s extensive experience as they continue their pursuit of success in the league.He was fired on the 6 of January 2025. 

==Personal life==
Barrasso and his wife Megan have three daughters, Ashley, Kelsey and Mallory. Barrasso founded the Ashley Barrasso Cancer Research Fund during the early 1990s after his oldest daughter survived a bout with neuroblastoma cancer. Ashley was originally diagnosed with cancer at the age of two, beating it through a bone marrow transplant at four before the cancer returned in June 2000. At the time of its reappearance, the adolescent survival rate for her cancer was 20%. In April 2000, doctors determined that Ashley would make a recovery. Barrasso&#x27;s father, Tom Barrasso Sr., was diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor in April 1999 and died in January 2000. This combination of events caused Barrasso to lose interest in ice hockey and choose to not play in the 2000–01 season. Barrasso has since appeared in charity events to raise money for cancer research.

<text>A stopwatch is a timepiece designed to measure the amount of time that elapses between its activation and deactivation.

A large digital version of a stopwatch designed for viewing at a distance, as in a sports stadium, is called a stop clock. In manual timing, the clock is started and stopped by a person pressing a button. In fully automatic time, both starting and stopping are triggered automatically, by sensors.
The timing functions are traditionally controlled by two buttons on the case. Pressing the top button starts the timer running, and pressing the button a second time stops it, leaving the elapsed time displayed. A press of the second button then resets the stopwatch to zero. The second button is also used to record &quot;split times&quot; or &quot;lap times&quot;. When the split time button is pressed while the watch is running it allows the elapsed time to that point to be read, but the watch mechanism continues running to record total elapsed time. Pressing the split button a second time allows the watch to resume display of total time.

Mechanical stopwatches are powered by a mainspring, which must be wound up by turning the knurled knob at the top of the stopwatch.

Digital electronic stopwatches are available which, due to their crystal oscillator timing element, are much more accurate than mechanical timepieces. Because they contain a microchip, they often include date and time-of-day functions as well. Some may have a connector for external sensors, allowing the stopwatch to be triggered by external events, thus measuring elapsed time far more accurately than is possible by pressing the buttons with one&#x27;s finger. The first digital timer used in organized sports was the Digitimer, developed by Cox Electronic Systems, Inc. of Salt Lake City Utah (1962). It utilized a Nixie-tube readout and provided a resolution of 1/1000 second. Its first use was in ski racing but was later used by the World University Games in Moscow, Russia, the U.S. NCAA, and in the Olympic trials.

The device is used when time periods must be measured precisely and with a minimum of complications. Laboratory experiments and sporting events like sprints are good examples.

The stopwatch function is also present as an additional function of many electronic devices such as wristwatches, cell phones, portable music players, and computers.
Humans are prone to make mistakes every time they use one. Normally, humans will take about 180–200 milliseconds to detect and respond to visual stimulus. However, in most situations where a stopwatch is used, there are indicators that the timing event is about to happen, and the manual action of starting/stopping the timer can be much more accurate. The average measurement error using manual timing was evaluated to be around 0.04 s when compared to electronic timing, in this case for a running sprint. 

To get more accurate results, most researchers use the propagation of uncertainty equation in order to reduce any error in experiments.

*formula_1

*formula_2 is the sum of the uncertainty between formula_3 and formula_4
*formula_5 is the value which is actually found from the experiment.
*formula_6 is the value of the uncertainty.

For example: If the result from measuring the width of a window is 1.50 ± 0.05 m, 1.50 will be formula_5 and 0.05 will be formula_6.

== Unit ==
In most science experiments, researchers will normally use SI or the International System of Units on any of their experiments. For stopwatches, the units of time that are generally used when observing a stopwatch are minutes, seconds, and &#x27;one-hundredth of a second&#x27;.

Many mechanical stopwatches are of the &#x27;decimal minute&#x27; type. These split one minute into 100 units of 0.6s each. This makes addition and subtraction of times easier than using regular seconds.

<text>A time clock, sometimes known as a clock card machine, punch clock, or time recorder, is a device that records start and end times for hourly employees (or those on flexi-time) at a place of business.

In mechanical time clocks, this was accomplished by inserting a heavy paper card, called a time card, into a slot on the time clock. When the time card hit a contact at the rear of the slot, the machine would print day and time information (a timestamp) on the card. One or more time cards could serve as a timesheet or provide the data to fill one. This allowed a timekeeper to have an official record of the hours an employee worked to calculate the pay owed an employee.

The terms bundy clock, or just bundy have been used in Australian English for time clocks. The term comes from brothers Willard and Harlow Bundy.

==History==

=== Origins ===
An early type of time clock, the autograph recorder, was patented in Chicago USA by Charles E, Van Voorhis in 1888, and manufactured by the Chicago Time Register Company. In this design, the employee signs his name on roll and operates a lever to obtain an automatic time stamp from an associated clock mechanism. An improved version of the system was developed by Dr Alexander Shiels of &quot;Kosmoid&quot; associations (patent issued 1904) and later re-manufactured, again under the &quot;Kosmoid&quot; brand, by the Rusmoid Company of London, in around 1920.

An early and influential time clock, sometimes described as the first, was invented on November 20, 1888, by Willard Le Grand Bundy, a jeweler in Auburn, New York. His patent of 1890 speaks of mechanical time recorders for workers in terms that suggest that earlier recorders already existed, but Bundy&#x27;s had various improvements; for example, each worker had his own key. A year later his brother, Harlow Bundy, organized the Bundy Manufacturing Company, and began mass-producing time clocks.

In 1900, the time recording business of Bundy Manufacturing, along with two other time equipment businesses, was consolidated into the International Time Recording Company (ITR).

In 1911, ITR, Bundy Mfg., and two other companies were amalgamated (via stock acquisition), forming a fifth company, Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), which would later change its name to IBM.

The Bundy clock (see image) was used by Birmingham City Transport to ensure that bus drivers did not depart from outlying termini before the due time; now preserved at Walsall Arboretum.

In 1909, Halbert P. Gillette explained about the state of the art around time clocks in those days:


An example of this other form of time clock, made by IBM, is pictured. The face shows employee numbers which would be dialed up by employees entering and leaving the factory. The day and time of entry and exit was punched onto cards inside the box.

=== Mid 20th century ===
In 1958, IBM&#x27;s Time Equipment Division was sold to the Simplex Time Recorder Company. However, in the United Kingdom ITR (a subsidiary of IBM United Kingdom Ltd.) was the subject of a management buy-out in 1963 and reverted to International Time Recorders. In 1982, International Time Recorders was acquired by Blick Industries of Swindon, England, who were themselves later absorbed by Stanley Security Systems.

The first punched-card system to be linked to a Z80 microprocessor was developed by Kronos Incorporated in the late 1970s and introduced as a product in 1979.

=== Late 20th century ===

In the late 20th century, time clocks started to move away from the mechanical machines to computer-based, electronic time and attendance systems. The employee registers with the system by swiping a magnetic stripe card, scanning a barcode, bringing an RFID (radio-frequency identification) tag close to a reader, entering a number or using a biometric reader. These systems are much more advanced than the mechanical time clock: various reports can be generated, including on compliance with the European Working Time Directive, and a Bradford factor report. Employees can also use the system to request holidays, enter absence requests and view their worked hours. User interfaces can be personalized and offer robust self-service capabilities.

Electronic time clock machines are manufactured in many designs by companies in China and sold under various brand names in places around the world, with accompanying software to extract the data from a single time clock machine, or several machines, and process the data into reports. In most cases local suppliers offer technical support and in some cases installation services.

More recently, time clocks have started to adopt technology commonly seen in phones and tablets – called &#x27;Smartclocks&#x27;. The &quot;state of the art&quot; smartclocks come with multi-touch screens, full color displays, real time monitoring for problems, wireless networking and over the air updates. Some of the smartclocks use front-facing cameras to capture employee clock-ins to deter &quot;buddy clocking&quot; or &quot;buddy punching&quot;, whereby one employee fraudulently records the time of another. This problem usually requires expensive biometric devices. With the increasing popularity of cloud-based software, some of the newer time clocks are built to work seamlessly with the cloud.

==Types==

=== Basic time clock ===

A basic time clock will just stamp the date and time on a time card, similar to a parking validation machine. These will usually be activated by a button that a worker must press to stamp their card, or stamp upon full insertion. Some machines use punch hole cards instead of stamping, which can facilitate automated processing on machinery not capable of optical character recognition.

There are also variations based on manufacture and machine used, and whether the user wants to record weekly or monthly recordings. The time cards usually have the workdays, &quot;time in&quot;, and &quot;time out&quot; areas marked on them so that employees can &quot;punch in&quot; or &quot;punch out&quot; in the correct place. The employee may be responsible for lining up the correct area of the card to be punched or stamped. Some time clocks feature a bell or signal relay to alert employees as to a certain time or break.

Fraudulent operation of time clocks can include overstamping, where one time is stamped over another, and buddy-punching, where one employee records time for another. In extreme cases, employees can use buddy-punching to skip entire days of work or accumulate additional overtime.

=== Self-calculating machines ===

Self-calculating machines are similar to basic time clocks. Nevertheless, at the end of each period, the total time recorded is added up, allowing for quicker processing by human resources or payroll. These machines sometimes have other functions such as automatic stamping, dual-colour printing, and automated column shift.

=== Software-based Time and Attendance Systems ===

Software-based time and attendance systems operate similarly to traditional paper-based methods, but they leverage computers and electronic check-in terminals for data input. These systems often integrate with human resources and payroll software, streamlining processes and reducing administrative overhead. While the upfront investment can be considerable—making them more common in larger organizations with over 30 employees—the efficiency gains and reduction in manual errors typically result in significant long-term cost savings.

For instance, tools such as online time calculators, like those provided by platforms such as TimeCalculatorApp.net, help businesses efficiently manage and reconcile time-related data. These calculators offer features that simplify complex time calculations, improving accuracy in payroll and project management.

=== TimeCalculatorApp.net for Personal Record-Keeping ===

In addition to its utility for businesses, TimeCalculatorApp.net is also a practical tool for individuals seeking to keep track of their personal time records. The platform enables users to perform a variety of time-related calculations, such as tracking hours worked, managing study schedules, or logging personal projects.

Its user-friendly interface and features, such as the ability to calculate total hours and split time periods, make it particularly useful for freelancers, students, and hobbyists. By automating these calculations, the app reduces the risk of manual errors and ensures more accurate record-keeping.

=== Mobile time tracking ===
With the mass market proliferation of mobile devices (smart phones, handheld devices), new types of self-calculating time tracking systems have been invented which allow a mobile workforce – such as painting companies or construction companies - to track employees &#x27;on&#x27; and &#x27;off&#x27; hours. This is generally accomplished through either a mobile application, or an IVR based phone call in system. Using a mobile device allows enterprises to better validate that their employees or suppliers are physically &#x27;clocking in&#x27; at a specific location using the GPS functionality of a mobile phone for extra validation.
==Biometrics==
Biometric time clocks are a feature of more advanced time and attendance systems. Rather than using a key, code or chip to identify the user, they rely on a unique attribute of the user, such as a hand print, finger print, finger vein, palm vein, facial recognition, iris or retina. The user will have their attribute scanned into the system. Biometric readers are often used in conjunction with an access control system, granting the user access to a building, and at the same time clocking them in recording the time and date. These systems also attempt to cut down on fraud such as &quot;buddy clocking.&quot; When combined with an access control system they can help prevent other types of fraud such as &#x27;ghost employees&#x27;, where additional identities are added to payroll but do not exist.

<text>Love on the Dole is a novel by Walter Greenwood, about working-class poverty in 1930s Northern England. It has been made into both a play and a film.

==The novel==
Walter Greenwood&#x27;s novel (1933) was written during the early 1930s as a response to the crisis of unemployment, which was being felt locally, nationally, and internationally. It is set in Hanky Park, an industrial slum in Salford, where Greenwood was born and brought up. The novel begins around the time of the General Strike of 1926, but its main action takes place in 1931.

The novel follows the Hardcastle family as they are pulled apart by mass unemployment. The 17-year-old Harry Hardcastle of Mansfield, studying in Lincoln, starts the novel working in a pawn shop, but is attracted to the glamour of working in the engineering factory Marlows Ltd. After seven years working there as an apprentice, he is laid off in the midst of the Great Depression, and is from that point on unable to find work. He becomes romantically involved with a girl on his street, Helen, whom he gets pregnant; this forces them to marry, despite the fact that Harry now not only is unemployed but also has been taken off the dole by the means test. Sally Hardcastle, his older sister, falls in love with a doomed socialist agitator, Larry Meath, and suffers the unwelcome attention of the local illicit bookmaker, Sam Grundy. Sally feels unable to compete with Meath&#x27;s socialist intellectualism, highlighting not only the economic but also the intellectual poverty of the local working-class community. The novel&#x27;s climax focuses on an actual march, in which the NUWM marched on Salford Town Hall in October 1931. The march itself was met with violent police resistance; in the book, Larry Meath dies as a result of blows to the head from a policeman&#x27;s truncheon. After Larry Meath&#x27;s death, Sally despondently succumbs to the attentions of Sam Grundy, which allows both her father and brother finally to find work.

The novel received much attention from writers, journalists, and politicians, who were all moved by its description of poverty, but, more importantly, by its account of a working-class community attempting to deal with that poverty with dignity and intelligence. Reviewing the American edition of the novel, Iris Barry stated: &quot;&quot;Love on the Dole&quot; is the real thing.&quot; Edith Sitwell, for example, also wrote: &quot;I do not know when I have been so deeply, terribly moved.&quot; It was a commercial success, with three impressions that year, and eight more by 1939.

Greenwood said he had &quot;tried to show what life means to a young man living under the shadow of the dole, the tragedy of a lost generation who are denied consummation, in decency, of the natural hopes and desires of youth.&quot;

==The play==

The novel was adapted for the stage by Ronald Gow, and opened at the Manchester Repertory Theatre in 1934, with Wendy Hiller as Sally Hardcastle. The &quot;real&quot; speech and contemporary social themes were new to British audiences. One reviewer said the play had been &quot;conceived and written in blood.&quot; It toured Britain with two separate companies, playing up to three performances a day, sometimes in cinemas in towns that had no theatre. A million people had seen it by the end of 1935. Runs in London, New York and Paris followed, making a name for Wendy Hiller, who married Gow in 1937.

But not all reviewers were impressed: writing in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Seán O&#x27;Casey said that &quot;there isn&#x27;t a character in it worth a curse, and there isn&#x27;t a thought in it worth remembering.&quot;

&quot;Love on the Dole&quot; drew the British public&#x27;s attention to a social problem in the United Kingdom in a similar way that &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956), &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; (1966) or &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982) would do for future generations (although its style is closer to 1915&#x27;s &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot;). The historian Stephen Constantine attributed the impact of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; to the way it moved the mostly middle-class audiences without blaming them – Gow said he &quot;aimed to touch the heart&quot;. In 1999, it was one of the National Theatre&#x27;s &quot;100 Plays of the Century&quot;.

==TV adaptation==
In 1967 the play was adapted for Granada Television by John Finch, with a cast including George A. Cooper, Martin Shaw, Malcolm Tierney, and Anne Stallybrass as Sally Hardcastle.

==Musical version==
A musical version of the play opened at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1970, written by Terry Hughes and Robert Gray, with music by Alan Fluck, directed and choreographed by Gillian Lynne.

==Film adaptation==
Although the book and play were successful, the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) would not allow a film to be made during the 1930s: it was a &quot;very sordid story in very sordid surroundings&quot;, and in Gow&#x27;s words &quot;regarded as &#x27;dangerous&#x27;&quot;. In 1936, the BBFC rejected a proposed film version of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;.

It was eventually filmed and released in 1941 by British National Films, with Deborah Kerr as Sally. But by then social conditions were being radically changed by the Second World War.

The film was the first English-made feature film to show British police wielding truncheons against a crowd.

<doc id="956730" wikidata="Q1466147" url="?curid=956730" title="Haptic communication">
<text>Haptic communication is nonverbal communication and interaction via the sense of touch. 
Touch can come in many different forms, some can promote physical and psychological well-being. A warm, loving touch can lead to positive outcomes while a violent touch can ultimately lead to a negative outcome. The sense of touch allows one to experience different sensations such as pleasure, pain, heat, or cold. One of the most significant aspects of touch is the ability to convey and enhance physical intimacy. The sense of touch is the fundamental component of haptic communication for interpersonal relationships. Touch can be categorized in many terms such as positive, playful, control, ritualistic, task-related or unintentional. It can be both sexual (kissing is one example that some perceive as sexual), and platonic (such as hugging or a handshake). Striking, pushing, pulling, pinching, kicking, strangling and hand-to-hand fighting are forms of touch in the context of physical abuse.

Touch is the most sophisticated and intimate of the five senses. Touch or haptics, from the ancient Greek word &quot;haptikos&quot;, is vital for survival.
Touch is the first sense to develop in the fetus. The development of an infant&#x27;s haptic senses and how it relates to the development of the other senses, such as vision, has been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.

Similarly to infants, in chimpanzees the sense of touch is highly developed. As newborns they see and hear poorly but cling strongly to their mothers. Harry Harlow conducted a controversial study involving rhesus monkeys and observed that monkeys reared with a &quot;terry cloth mother&quot;, a wire feeding apparatus wrapped in softer terry cloth which provided a level of tactile stimulation and comfort, were considerably more emotionally stable as adults than those with a mere &quot;wire mother&quot;. For his experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed surrogate mother and a wire surrogate mother which held a bottle with food. It turns out that the rhesus monkeys spent most of their time with the terry cloth mother, over the wire surrogate with a bottle of food, which indicates that they preferred touch, warmth, and comfort over sustenance.

==Categories==
Heslin outlines five haptic categories:
; Functional/professional : expresses task-orientation
; Social/polite: expresses ritual interaction
; Friendship/warmth : expresses idiosyncratic relationship
; Love/intimacy : expresses emotional attachment
; Sexual/arousal : expresses sexual intent

The intent of a touch is not always exclusive and touching can evolve to each one of Heslin&#x27;s categories.

===Functional/professional===
Managers should know the effectiveness of using touch while communicating to subordinates, but need to be cautious and understand how touch can be misunderstood. A hand on the shoulder for one person may mean a supportive gesture, while it could mean a sexual advance to another person. Working with others and using touch to communicate, a manager needs to be aware of each person&#x27;s touch tolerance.

Henley&#x27;s research found that a person in power is more likely to touch a subordinate, but the subordinate is not free to touch in kind. Touch is a powerful nonverbal communication tool and this different standard between a superior and subordinate can lead to confusion whether the touch is motivated by dominance or intimacy according to Borisoff and Victor.

Walton stated in his book that touching is the ultimate expression of closeness or confidence between two people, but not seen often in business or formal relationships. Touching stresses how special the message is that is being sent by the initiator. &quot;If a word of praise is accompanied by a touch on the shoulder, that&#x27;s the gold star on the ribbon,&quot; wrote Walton.

The most common use of haptic touch in business is the handshake. A handshake in the business world is key to giving a good first impression. However, there are different forms of the handshake that can be given in an appropriate situation which include: a firm handshake (communicates confidence and strength), a limp handshake (conveys weakness and dishonesty), a clasp (use of both hands displays a high level of respect), and a handshake with grip (displays intimidation and dominance).

===Social/polite===
Moving from one haptic category to another can become blurred by culture. There are many areas in the United States where a touch on the is accepted as socially correct and polite. However, in the Midwest, this is not always an acceptable behavior.

The initial connection to another person in a professional setting usually starts off with a touch, specifically a handshake. A person&#x27;s handshake can speak volumes about them and their personality. Chiarella wrote an article for Esquire magazine explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ from person to person and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the verbal communication.

A handshake is not only limited to a professional setting but as well an important aspect of youth&#x27;s team sports. Hamilton wrote that the handshake represents the end-of-game as an embodied ritual, form of intimate touch, and legal gesture. These handshakes also vary in types, with the formal business handshake that usually occurs in job and formal settings. In the end-of-game embodied ritual, this usually has high fives in a post game line. There is also the traditional dap up in certain social settings, a different type of handshake that can also serve as a greeting, departure, or overall a symbol of friendship. The word dap serves as an acronym for dignity and pride and signifies that the two people shake hands are equals in regards to one another. This handshake originated within the Vietnam War between black G.I.s as a way to combat the segregation faced within the war. 

Jones explained communication with touch as the most intimate and involving form which helps people to keep good relationships with others. His study with Yarbrough covered touch sequences and individual touches.

Touch sequences fall into two different types, repetitive and strategic. Repetitive is when one person touches and the other person reciprocates. The majority of these touches are considered positive. Strategic touching is a series of touching usually with an ulterior or hidden motive thus making them seem to be using touch as a game to get someone to do something for them.

More common than the sequential touches are the individual or single touches. They must be read by using the total context of what was said, the nature of the relationship and what kind of social setting was involved when the person was touched.

Yarbrough designed a blueprint for how to touch. She designated the different body areas as to whether they are &#x27;touchable&#x27; or not. Non-vulnerable body parts (NVBP) are the hand, arm, shoulder and upper back, and vulnerable body parts (VBP) are all other body regions.

Civil inattention is defined as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger&#x27;s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon. It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be so crowded that they &#x27;touch&#x27; another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect those around them.

===Friendship/warmth===
It is more acceptable for women to touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched. Women and girls are more commonly known for interacting with each other through touch than men and boys are. This is thought to be because same-sex touch is acceptable for women. Whitcher and Fisher conducted a study to see whether friendly touch in a healthcare setting reduced anxiety equally or differently between men and women. A nurse was told to touch patients for one minute while the patients looked at a pamphlet during a routine preoperative procedure. Females reacted positively to the touch, whereas males did not. It was surmised that males equated the touch to being treated as inferior or dependent.

Touching among family members has been found to affect the behavior of those involved. Touch is a way that a child can express positive emotion. For example, physical affection, like hugs, can serve as an overt display of love. Various factors are at work within a family setting. As a child grows older, the amount of touching by the parent decreases although it does continue to be an important social behavior for that child to communicate positive or negative emotions later in their future.

===Love and intimacy===
====Healthy touch====
The primary nonverbal behavior that has the biggest effect on interpersonal relationships is touch. The amount of touching increases as a relationship moves from impersonal to personal.

Three areas of public touch between couples have been studied: the amount of touch between a couple in the initial stages of a romantic relationship; how much touching goes on between the couple, and the extent of touching with the amount of touch men and women displayed and who initiated the touch and when they initiated it.

Public touch can serve as a tie sign that shows others that one&#x27;s partner is &quot;taken&quot;. When a couple is holding hands or putting their arms around each other, this is a tie sign showing others that they are together. Tie signs are used more often by couples in the dating and courtship stages than between their married counterparts according to Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall.

Studies have also shown a difference between the sexes on who touches when. In the initial stages of a relationship, men often follow socially prescribed gender roles. Patterson indicated that men fulfilling this social role would touch more and after initial touch in casual relationships and as the relationship became more intimate during serious dating or marriage relationships, women would touch more. American culture still dictates that men &quot;make the first move&quot; in the context of dating and relationships.

Touching between married couples may help maintain good health. In a study by University of Virginia psychologist Jim Coan, women under stress showed signs of immediate relief by merely holding their husband&#x27;s hand. This seemed to be effective when the woman was part of a satisfying marriage.

====Violence====

Touching in intimate relationships may also be violent at times. McEwan and Johnson categorize violent touch in relationships into two categories: intimate terrorism and common couple violence. Intimate terrorism is characterized by an escalating need to control or dominate a relationship with high frequency and severity. Common couple violence, on the other hand, is often a result of minor conflict, is less frequent and severe, and does not escalate over time. These definitions encompass the types of violence within a situation regarding a couple, both intimate terrorism and common couple violence. On a broader spectrum there is also domestic violence that regards all types of violence including emotional, physical, or sexual. But, instead of only in a couple situation, domestic violence is not limited to just that, it also defines situations with any family member or people who live together. This includes roommates as well and also includes different types of abuse such as child, elder, or marital abuse. 

===Sexual/arousal===
According to Givens, the process of nonverbal communication or negotiation is to send and receive messages in an attempt to gain someone&#x27;s approval or love. Courtship, which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication gestures to tell each other to come nearer and nearer until we touch. Essential signals in the path to intimacy include facial nuzzles, kissing and caressing each other.

Courtship has five phases which include the attention phase, recognition phase, conversation phase, touching phase, and the love-making phase. Haptics takes place more during the last two phases.

The touching phase:
&quot;First touch&quot;: Is likely to be more &quot;accidental&quot; than premeditated by touching a neutral body part and where the recipient either accepts the touch or rejects it through body movement.

&quot;Hugging&quot;: The embrace is the most basic way of telling someone that you love them and possibly need them, too.

&quot;Intention to touch&quot;: A nonverbal communication haptic code or cue is the intention behind it. Reaching your hand across the table to a somewhat unknown person is used as a way to show readiness to touch.

&quot;Kissing&quot;: Moving in concert by turning heads to allow for the lips to touch is the final part of the fourth stage of courtship, the kiss.

The final phase, love-making, which includes tactile stimulation during foreplay known as the light or protopathic touch. Any feelings of fear or apprehension may be calmed through other touching like kissing, nuzzling, and a gentle massage.

== Context of touch ==
There are various contexts and dimensions that touch can interpret. These dimensions that many have described include intensity, duration, location, frequency, and instrument of touch.

*&quot;Intensity&quot;: relates to how delicate or how strong the touch is.
*&quot;Duration&quot;: relates to how short or prolonged the touch was.
*&quot;Location&quot;: refers to the area where the person was touched.
*&quot;Frequency&quot;: represents the number of touches that happen.
*&quot;Instrument of touch&quot;: refers to the touch with other body parts like feet, lips, and other objects as well.

==Meanings==
Touch research conducted by Jones and Yarbrough revealed 18 different meanings of touch, grouped in seven types: Positive affect (emotion), playfulness, control, ritual, hybrid (mixed), task-related, and accidental touch.

===Positive affect===
These touches communicate positive emotions and occur mostly between persons who have close relationships. These touches can be further classified as support, appreciation, inclusion, sexual interest or intent, and affection. Research has shown that hugging can reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

*&quot;Support&quot;: Serve to nurture, reassure, or promise protection. These touches generally occur in situations which either virtually require or make it clearly preferable that one person show concern for another who is experiencing distress.
*&quot;Appreciation&quot;: Express gratitude for something another person has done.
*&quot;Inclusion&quot;: Draw attention to the act of being together and suggest psychological closeness.
*&quot;Sexual&quot;: Express physical attraction or sexual interest.
*&quot;Affection&quot;: Express generalized positive regard beyond mere acknowledgment of the other.

===Playful===
These touches serve to lighten an interaction. These touches communicate a double message since they always involve a play signal, either verbal or nonverbal, which indicates the behavior is not to be taken seriously. These touches can be further classified as affectionate and aggressive.

*&quot;Playful affection&quot;: Serve to lighten interaction. The seriousness of the positive message is diminished by the play signal. These touches indicate teasing and are usually mutual.
*&quot;Playful aggression&quot;: Like playful affection these touches are used to serve to lighten interaction, however, the play signal indicates aggression. These touches are initiated, rather than mutual. Since the playful aggression usually involves these antagonistic actions that from an outside perspective may be seen as serious, sometimes these playful actions can be categorized as violent. In a formal environment, this type of haptic communication may be frowned upon such as in schools or a work setting and could be prohibited.

===Control===

These touches serve to direct the behavior, attitude, or feeling state of the recipient. The key feature of these touches is that almost all of the touches are initiated by the person who attempts influence. These touches can be further classified as compliance, attention-getting, and announcing a response.

*&quot;Compliance&quot;: Attempts to direct behavior of another person, and often, by implication, to influence attitudes or feelings.
*&quot;Attention-getting&quot;: Serve to direct the touch recipient&#x27;s perceptual focus toward something.
*&quot;Announcing a response&quot;: Call attention to and emphasize a feeling state of initiator; implicitly requests affect response from another.

===Ritualistic===
These touches consist of greeting and departure touches. They serve no other function than to help make transitions in and out of focused interaction.

*&quot;Greeting&quot;: Serve as part of the act of acknowledging another at the opening of an encounter.
*&quot;Departure&quot;: Serve as a part of the act of closing an encounter
These touches can differ depending on the location the social interaction is taking place. For example, in Japan a common greeting and departure is to bow to someone when greeting them. For the Maori people, a tribe in New Zealand, people often rub noses to initiate a greeting, where two people press their forehead together and rub their noses with each other. These greetings are seen as a social norm due to their geographic location, depending on the location these types of greeting and departure touches will not be seen as socially acceptable. There is also differences within geographic locations as well, it then comes down to the formality of a setting. In America, it is common for people to greet friends with a hug, but in the setting of a job or an interview, one would normally have the greeting of a handshake instead. Social norms dictate much of the ritualistic behavior that is initiated.

===Hybrid===
These touches involve two or more of the meanings described above. These touches can be further classified as greeting/affection and departure/affection.

&quot;Greeting/affection&quot;: Express affection and acknowledgement of the initiation of an encounter

&quot;Departure/affection&quot;: Express affection and serve to close an encounter

===Task-related===
These touches are directly associated with the performance of a task. These touches can be further classified as:
* &quot;Reference to appearance&quot;: Point out or inspect a body part or artefact referred to in a verbal comment about appearance
* &quot;Instrumental ancillary&quot;: Occur as an unnecessary part of the accomplishment of a task
* &quot;Instrumental intrinsic&quot;: Accomplish a task in and out of itself i.e., a helping touch.

===Accidental===
These touches are perceived as unintentional and have no meaning. They consist mainly of brushes.
Research by Martin in a retailing context found that male and female shoppers who were accidentally touched from behind by other shoppers left a store earlier than people who had not been touched and evaluated brands more negatively, resulting in the Accidental Interpersonal Touch effect.

==Culture==
The amount of touching that occurs within a culture is largely based on the relative high context or low context of the culture.

=== High contact ===
In a high contact culture, many things are not verbally stated but are expressed through physical touch. For instance, Cheek kissing is a very common method of greeting in Latin America, but among Northern Europeans it is an uncommon form of greeting. Different cultures have different display rules, the degree with which emotions are expressed. Cultural display rules also affect the degree to which individuals share their personal space, gaze and physical contact during interactions. In a High contact culture, such as South America, Latin America, Southern Europe, Africa, Russia, the Middle East and others, people tend to share more physical contact. High contact cultures communicate through long gazes, long hugs, and share a decrease in proxemics.

=== Low contact ===
Low contact cultures such as: The United States, Canada, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Asia prefer infrequent touching, larger physical distance, indirect body orientations (during interaction) along with little share gazes. In the Thai culture, kissing a friend on the cheek is less common than in the Latin Americas. Remland and Jones studied groups of people communicating and found that in England (8%), France (5%) and the Netherlands (4%), touching was rare compared to the Italian (14%) and Greek (12.5%) samples.

===Internal differences===
Frequency of touch also varies significantly between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, one of which examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone was touching more frequently than normal it would be necessary to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a kiss on the cheek is considered a polite greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love.

==Emotion and touch==
Recently, researchers have shown that touch communicates distinct emotions such as anger, fear, happiness, sympathy, love, and gratitude. Moreover, the accuracy with which subjects were capable of communicating the emotions were commensurate with facial and vocal displays of emotion.

Depression has been linked to touch deprivation in adults and research has established associations between touch deprivation and eating disorders. Men have been found more likely to experience touch deprivation than women due to stronger social prohibitions against same-sex touching among adult males.

<doc id="956795" wikidata="Q7380056" url="?curid=956795" title="Running up the score">
<text>Running up the score (or &quot;&quot;) is a sports strategy that occurs when a winning team continues to play in such a way as to score additional points after the outcome of the game is beyond doubt. More sportsmanlike alternatives might include pulling out most of the team&#x27;s first-string players, or calling plays designed to run out the clock (&quot;e.g.&quot;, in American football, kneeling or running the ball up the middle). Mercy rules are used in some amateur sports, which end the game when the score differential reaches a certain point. Running up the score has generally been considered controversial and has been subject to debate between those who support and oppose the use of the strategy.

Those who oppose the strategy note that running up the score may be considered poor sportsmanship by fans, players, and coaches, but there have been different opinions of how big an insult running up the score is. Allegations of poor sportsmanship are also often brought up soon after a team scores multiple times near the end of a one-sided match. Running up the score can also cause injuries to a game&#x27;s starting players, can lead to less game experience for non-starting and lower caliber players on the team (in cases where starters are left in a game well after the outcome is certain), and can motivate future opposing teams to the team running up the score. Players on the losing side may also end up feeling disrespected and may decide to vent their frustration through violent or unsporting play, which can lead to injuries and fights, and even potential post-game punishment such as fines or suspension from future play.

Those who favor running up the score argue there are potential benefits, such as catering to polls (when they are used to determine team rankings), getting additional experience for players, or preventing potential comebacks. In many sports, teams are incentivized to run up the score, owing to the use of goal difference (or equivalents such as net run rate) as a tiebreaker in competitions; in this case there may be less of a stigma around large score differentials.

==Justifications==
===Benefits in the BCS and other polls===
Some sports (especially American College sports) have used polls for determining team rankings, matches, and championships. Certain coaches are notorious for running up the score to impress coaches and sportswriters who vote in the Amway Coaches Poll or AP Poll. It is a common allegation that some poll voters simply look at box scores before punching in their votes. When the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) existed in college football, the votes had a huge impact on who went to BCS games, including the national championship. Only by watching the game or game tape (or by careful box-score scrutiny) can a coach determine if a 49–21 score was caused by a fairly one-sided game or the winning team trying to make the score look more impressive when the game&#x27;s outcome was certain. The BCS computers originally included margin of victory as a component, but the BCS removed that element after noticing large increases in teams running up the score.

From the 2014 season, the BCS was replaced by the College Football Playoff (CFP). Polls do not play a role in determining CFP participants; instead, these teams are chosen by a selection committee similar to that used in the NCAA basketball tournament selection process.

===Practice===
Some fans of teams whose coaches frequently run up the score may also note that running up the score has its advantages. Though many coaches who run up the score do it with only their first-string players, a coach who uses his third- and fourth-string players can give them vital in-game experience if he allows them to do more than, in American football, just kneel on the football or run the ball up the middle. When they are not allowed to make passing and running plays that the first- and second-stringers get to make, their skills may not develop as quickly.

Alternatively, in college sports with many players from successful teams having hopes of becoming professionals, running up the score gives players the chance to improve their statistics and to show off skills that the conventional offense would not allow. While it may be seen as poor sportsmanship, as there is no guarantee that any player will be picked for the professional leagues, every opportunity to bolster stats and impress scouts can be seen as improving the professional prospects of the players.

=== Gameplay ===
It is also argued that it can be used as a preventive measure to prevent a huge comeback. In 2006, Penn State lost to Notre Dame 41–17. Notre Dame justified running up the score because Penn State was known for late comebacks. Supporters of preventively running up the score will often point to games such as the 2006 Insight Bowl where Minnesota blew a 38–7 lead in the third quarter, to eventually lose 44–41 to Texas Tech.

=== Improving tiebreaker qualification chances ===
In addition, many leagues use tiebreakers if two or more teams are tied in the standings; one common tiebreaker when multiple teams are involved (such as when three teams are tied, with no team having beaten both of the others) is &quot;point differential&quot; (calculated as the difference between the number of points a team scores vs. the number of points a team allows against common opponents) or variations thereof, such as cricket&#x27;s net run rate; &quot;running up a score&quot; can help their chances of winning positions and stop the other team from scoring as well (though some leagues counter that by placing a cap on the number of points which can be counted in a point differential, such as no more than 14; then, even if the score is 49–0, only 14 points will count in the tiebreaker).

=== Other justifications ===
An argument frequently used in favor of running up the score is the belief that it is not the coach&#x27;s or winning team&#x27;s fault if a weak team is unable to stop a high-powered offensive juggernaut. Florida State coach Bobby Bowden contended that it was not his job to call plays that are inconsistent with his regular offense. He felt that the prevention of further scoring was the responsibility of the opposing team&#x27;s defense. Also, some coaches advocate running up the score to make another point, such as showing disapproval of comments made by opposing players, coaches, etc., in the media.

Running up the score in professional leagues generally creates significantly less controversy and indeed the term is far less common. While there are numerous reasons to run out the clock, there is no reason not to score more points if the situation allows. As all teams are professionals, even perceived underdogs have the potential to score points quickly if they are given the chance. Even teams with a dominant lead have a strong interest in maintaining possession to run down the clock, which often puts them in the position to score more points.

At all levels of play, it is generally accepted that players or teams close to breaking significant records can run up the score without it being seen as overtly disrespectful. In fact, many offensive records almost require running up the score to be in contention as a result of records set in eras in which leagues were less balanced, seasons were of a different length, or rules were substantially different.

In one instance that did not involve the score, but where a long-established record could have easily been broken, a coach was praised for his sportsmanship. In 1999, during a 44–28 defeat of the Cleveland Browns, Cincinnati Bengals coach Bruce Coslet took running back Corey Dillon out of the game early in the fourth quarter. By that point, he had gained 246 yards and, had he continued playing, almost certainly would have broken Walter Payton&#x27;s single-game rushing record of 275 yards. After the game, Coslet explained that since Payton, who had died the month before, had set the record in a game his team won 10–7, he did not feel it right for Dillon to break it in a game that, by the point he took the player out, became one-sided.

In 1995, with a 38–17 lead going into the fourth quarter over Georgia, Florida head coach Steve Spurrier decided to run up the score to &quot;hang half a hundred&quot; on the scoreboard to humiliate their opponents on their home field, something that had never been done before. His team succeeded with a final score of 52–17. That record still stands as the most points ever scored by an opposing team at Sanford Stadium.

====Georgia Tech====

On October 7, 1916, Georgia Tech defeated the Cumberland College Bulldogs 222–0. Cumberland had previously disbanded their football team, but quickly formed a scrub team when faced with fines if they refused to play. Georgia Tech scored 63 points in the first quarter and 63 points in the second quarter, then 54 points in the third quarter and 42 points in the fourth. Cumberland did not record a first down during the game. Georgia Tech won under the coaching of John Heisman, who wanted revenge after an embarrassing 22–0 loss earlier that year to a Cumberland baseball team that he suspected of having used professional players posing as students.

====Houston====
On November 23, 1968, the University of Houston defeated the University of Tulsa 100–6. Though they had a 24–0 advantage at halftime, Houston scored 11 touchdowns in the second half – including 7 in the fourth quarter – for an astounding 94-point blowout. 

They came close again in 1989, routing a Southern Methodist (SMU) team fresh off the so-called death penalty in by a score of 95–21 in what could be termed as a &quot;revenge game&quot; after years of humiliation against its longtime Southwestern Conference rival; Houston itself was under a bowl and television ban that season because of its own past recruiting violations, meaning only those in attendance at the Astrodome witnessed the Cougars embarrass the Mustangs.

In 1990, Houston defeated Division I-AA opponent Eastern Washington University 84–21 and kept QB David Klingler playing late in the game to allow him to set NCAA records for most TD passes in a single game and a single season. Klinger threw 11 TD passes in that game, with 5 in the second half – including 2 in the fourth quarter. His final touchdown pass gave Houston a 77–14 lead with their starting QB still in the game. The next year, 1991, they would blow out Louisiana Tech University 73–3 in the opening game of the season.

====Miami====
On November 30, 1985, the University of Miami Hurricanes were playing the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame in Gerry Faust&#x27;s final game as Notre Dame head coach. The Hurricanes, led by Jimmy Johnson, were trying to impress pollsters since they were ranked fourth in the polls prior to the game. The Hurricanes called a fake punt on fourth-and-11 in the fourth quarter with a 44–7 lead, scored a touchdown off a blocked punt with less than six minutes left, and went on to win 58–7. Miami was rewarded in the AP poll as it passed idle Iowa to reach No. 3 and set up a possible national championship with a victory over Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl. Receiving criticism after the game, Johnson replied, &quot;Nobody apologized to me when Oklahoma did it&quot;, a reference to a 1980 rout by the score of 63–14 when Johnson was head coach at Oklahoma State University. Miami would go on to lose to Tennessee, 35–7, in the 1986 Sugar Bowl.

====Notre Dame====
Notre Dame defeated Georgia Tech 69–14 in 1977. The Fighting Irish led 21–7 at halftime but scored 21 points in the third quarter and 27 in the fourth. Only a missed extra point after ND&#x27;s eighth touchdown kept the Irish from scoring 70 points for the first time since 1932 and only the second time in Notre Dame Stadium history. After ND took a 62–7 lead, Georgia Tech scored its only second half points on a kickoff return for a touchdown by Eddie Lee Ivery; the Irish would not surrender another kickoff return for a touchdown until 21 years later, against Kevin Faulk and LSU in 1998. The blowout was payback for a 23–14 upset victory by Georgia Tech over Notre Dame in 1976, after which Yellow Jacket players were quoted as deriding the Fighting Irish as fat and slow. There also was bad blood between ND coach Dan Devine and GT coach Pepper Rodgers, dating back to the days when they coached arch-rivals Missouri and Kansas, respectively; Devine&#x27;s Tigers had defeated Rodgers&#x27;s Jayhawks 69–21 in the 1969 season finale in Lawrence. The 1977 humiliation of Georgia Tech did not impact Notre Dame&#x27;s poll standing; they remained No. 5 in the AP poll—but the Fighting Irish won the rest of their games to finish 11–1 and win the 1977 national championship.

Notre Dame defeated Boston College 54–7 in a 1992 game where Fighting Irish coach Lou Holtz called a fake punt on the first series of the third quarter, with his team already possessing an enormous (albeit not technically insurmountable) 37–0 lead. A year later, Boston College would upset Notre Dame 41–39 in the final regular season game of the year, knocking the Fighting Irish from 1st to 4th in the AP poll and paving the way for Florida State to be voted national champions.

While playing at longtime rival Stanford in 2003, Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willingham allowed his punter to call a fake punt in response to a punt block read while the Fighting Irish led 57–7 late in the fourth quarter. Willingham was formerly head coach at Stanford.

====Ohio State====
In 1968, the Ohio State Buckeyes, en route to a national championship, defeated their bitter rival, the Michigan Wolverines, 50–14. Late in the game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common extra point kick, Ohio State head coach Woody Hayes opted for a two-point conversion, which was unsuccessful. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, &quot;Because I couldn&#x27;t go for three!&quot;, though players have commented that there was some sort of confusion on the extra point kick, and Hayes was just covering for his players. The following season, the heavily favored Buckeyes fell to the Wolverines, with Bo Schembechler using the 50–14 blowout as a motivation.

Head coach Urban Meyer&#x27;s 2014 Ohio State team defeated Wisconsin 59–0 in the Big Ten championship game. Meyer later said that he intentionally ran up the score against Wisconsin to help his team be chosen for the College Football Playoff.

====Oklahoma====
On November 8, 2003, the Oklahoma Sooners showed little mercy against the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, cruising to a 49–0 halftime lead. Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops denied running up the score as his second string players came out in the 3rd quarter and put up 28 more points to finish with a final score of 77–0 and 639 yards of total offense. This was the worst loss in Texas A&amp;M football history. In Stoops&#x27; defense, the coaches agreed to a running clock during most of the second half and the entire 4th quarter. Also, at one point in the fourth quarter, Oklahoma had first and goal inside the A&amp;M 5-yard line with a chance to score over 80 points, but Stoops called four consecutive runs up the middle to prevent another score.

====Oklahoma State====
In their 2012 season opener, the Oklahoma State Cowboys defeated the Savannah State Tigers 84–0. In defense of the lop-sided result, interim defense coordinator Glenn Spencer claimed the shutout was a tribute to the team&#x27;s full-time defensive coordinator Bill Young, who had recently undergone an undisclosed medical procedure. It ended up as the most lopsided victory for OSU since a 117–0 rout of Southwestern Oklahoma in 1916 and Savannah State&#x27;s worst loss since a 98–0 defeat against Bethune-Cookman in 1953, a season when the Tigers were outscored 444–6.

====Penn State====
Although longtime Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was regarded by some as one who did everything he could to avoid running up the score, such as in a 63–10 win over Illinois in 2005 where Penn State held a 56–3 halftime lead, Pitt partisan journalist Beano Cook claimed he made an exception in 1985 against hated rival Pitt. The game was well in hand with the score 31–0 when the assistants called the first string team off the field. Paterno supposedly immediately ordered them back in, saying, &quot;I want to bury Pitt.&quot; Paterno&#x27;s 1991 Penn State team is often accused of running it up on Cincinnati 81–0, but this was refuted by the Bearcats&#x27; coach Tim Murphy, who said &quot;I think Joe&#x27;s a class guy and I don&#x27;t believe he&#x27;d do that in a hundred years,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;We made too many mistakes even for a first game of the season and that&#x27;s my fault. I&#x27;m embarrassed, not Joe Paterno.&quot;

====Stanford====
In the early 2000s, Stanford was considered the bottom-dweller of the Pac-10, whereas in-state rival USC was named the &quot;Team of the Decade&quot; by both CBSSports.com and Football.com, as well as the &quot;Program of the Decade&quot; by SI.com. However, after the arrival of head coach Jim Harbaugh to The Farm in 2007 and Stanford&#x27;s record-breaking upset of the Trojans that fall, the Stanford-USC rivalry began to pick up in intensity and importance. During their 2009 meeting, Stanford was crushing USC in the Coliseum, leading 42–21 midway through the fourth quarter. After a touchdown run by future Heisman Trophy runner-up Toby Gerhart to bring the score to 48–21, Harbaugh kept the Cardinal offense on the field to attempt a two-point conversion. When asked what was going on, Harbaugh said, &quot;I want to put fifty on these motherfuckers.&quot; The two-point conversion was unsuccessful, but Stanford would later score in the final minutes of the game, and ultimately won 55–21 after scoring 27 points in the fourth quarter. It was the worst home loss in USC history at the time, and is USC&#x27;s largest margin of defeat in the Stanford-USC rivalry.

After the game, USC head coach Pete Carroll approached Harbaugh and, visibly angry, asked &quot;What&#x27;s your deal? You alright?&quot; To which Harbaugh retorted &quot;I&#x27;m fine. What&#x27;s &quot;your&quot; deal?&quot; This moment (in addition to the aforementioned Stanford upset of #1 USC in 2007) is seen by many as the turning point of the Stanford Cardinal football program, which, for the next eight years, was one of the most successful programs in college football.

====Texas A&amp;M====
In the same 2003 season that Oklahoma defeated Texas A&amp;M 77–0 (see above), A&amp;M themselves ran up the score in a 73–10 home romp against Baylor University. A&amp;M naturally entered the rematch a year later as huge favorites, and the game was to be played the week prior to the major rematch game against Oklahoma. Perhaps too busy awaiting their moment of revenge against the Sooners the week to come, Texas A&amp;M succumbed to the Baylor team they had humiliated the year before. As the Bears only managed three wins that entire 2004 season, the revenge-minded Baylor team&#x27;s 35–34 overtime victory was arguably the biggest upset of the year. (Texas A&amp;M did end up losing to Oklahoma again the following week, as well, although this time only by a score of 42–35.)

====Washington and Oregon====
The largest margin of victory turnaround in Division I-A football in successive years belongs to the University of Washington and the University of Oregon and showcased two prime examples of running up the score. In 1973, Oregon ran up the score at home, burying Washington 58–0. A year later, Washington responded with a 66–0 drubbing of Oregon back home in Seattle. In that game, Washington&#x27;s starting quarterback Chris Rowland played longer than necessary and suffered a season-ending knee injury. Rowland recalled that Washington head coach Jim Owens &quot;wanted me in and said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to beat these guys more than they beat us.&#x27; He [Owens] apologized to me because it was a personal thing for him.&quot;

====BYU and Utah====
The BYU-Utah football rivalry&#x27;s history is replete with lopsided games on both sides. During the early days of the BYU football program, the Cougars would frequently be blown away by physically superior Utah teams. At one point, between the years of 1931–37, Utah outscored BYU by a combined score of 200–6. The tide changed with BYU&#x27;s hiring of LaVell Edwards, who brought the program credibility (and a national championship in 1984). During the Edwards years, the Cougars were regularly accused of running the score up mercilessly against the Utes. Years where this was particularly true included 1977 (38–8), 1980 (56–6), 1981 (56–28), 1983 (55–7), and 1989 (70–31). Normally, this practice was orchestrated by Edwards&#x27; assistants, such as touchdown-happy offensive coordinator Doug Scovil. Perhaps the most infamous example of Scovil&#x27;s tendency toward scoring at all times was the 1977 match-up between the two teams. BYU quarterback Marc Wilson was in the midst of a spectacular sophomore season, and Utah was struggling defensively. During the fourth quarter, having already passed for 555 yards and four scores, Wilson was benched with his team leading 31–8. However, a member of the stadium press contingent recognized that Wilson had left the game just six yards shy of the NCAA single-game passing record. Scovil was informed, and promptly sent Wilson back into the game; the quarterback promptly threw an eight-yard pass that gave him the record. Scovil indicated for him to remain in the game, and he subsequently threw a fifth touchdown pass, giving BYU a 38–8 victory. Utah head coach Wayne Howard was enraged, and that incident helped fuel the venom of the rivalry moving forward. BYU has rarely beaten Utah since Edwards&#x27; departure, although the most recent (2021) match-up of the two teams saw BYU winning 26-17 and costing Utah its national ranking.

===Professional football===
Running up the score is rarely done by teams in the National Football League (NFL) and other professional American football leagues. A primary reason is that starting players and coaches are paid hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each year, which is affected by how the players and the team performs during the season. Any attempt to run up the score increases the risks of losing a key player to an injury that could affect the team&#x27;s chances for the rest of the season. Thus, if a team decides to keep their stars in during a blowout, it is usually viewed by the opponent as an insult. Another factor is that the parity that the salary cap has brought to the NFL in the 1990s has evened out competition somewhat, with less talent disparity between the best and worst teams compared to the past. It is much more difficult to run up the score to embarrassing (50+ point) margins in the modern game at the pro level. The greatest margin of victory at the professional level happened in the 1940 NFL Championship Game won by the Chicago Bears over the Washington Redskins 73–0. In 1976, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Atlanta Falcons 59–0, a margin which was matched in 2009 when the New England Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans in the New England snow. Most recently, the New Orleans Saints defeated the Indianapolis Colts 62–7 on October 23, 2011; the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 58–0 on December 9, 2012; and the Miami Dolphins defeated the Denver Broncos 70–20 on September 24, 2023.

The one exception to this general rule is in regards to the NFL&#x27;s tiebreaking rules that are used to determine which teams qualify for the playoffs if they are tied in the standings. One criterion to break ties is comparing the total number of points scored by each team during the regular season. Under this scenario, running up the score in a late season game is not considered poor sportsmanship because there is a benefit to having the score higher. This scenario almost occurred during the 1999 season when the Green Bay Packers could possibly have made the playoffs if the Dallas Cowboys had lost and they had scored enough points against the division rival Cardinals, in their final regular season game to surpass the Carolina Panthers in total points scored. They ended up beating the Cardinals 49–24, but Dallas went on to beat the Giants later that day to earn the final playoff spot and knock the Packers out of the playoff picture anyway.

Accusations of running up the score are unusual in the NFL (except in playoff races), but not unheard of. One of the most notorious occurred on November 17, 1985, when the New York Jets defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 62–28 in a regular season game. The two teams had last met in the final game of the previous season, when Tampa Bay had somewhat controversially appeared to stop playing defense and allowing the Jets to score late in a 41–21 victory in an apparent effort to get the ball back so that running back James Wilder Sr. could attempt to break the NFL record for most yards from scrimmage in a season. Commentators wondered if the Jets&#x27; huge margin of victory was a way of retaliating against the Bucs for such poor sportsmanship, but the Jets and their coaches denied that there had been any conscious effort to run the score up. The Jets&#x27; denials may be valid since Bucs coach John McKay, who allowed the Jets to score late in the 1984 contest, retired after the &#x27;84 season and had been replaced by Leeman Bennett, and also the Jets were 11–5 in 1985 and reached the playoffs, while Tampa Bay was in the midst of back-to-back 2–14 seasons in 1985 and &#x27;86.

A game in 1996 between the Packers and Cowboys ended in a 21–6 Cowboys victory and some complaints by Green Bay players that the home team&#x27;s final field goal was an insult to them, as Dallas had the ball deep in Green Bay territory with the game well in hand as it ended, yet chose to score more points anyway. However, the final field goal was not an attempt at embarrassment, but at a record – Cowboys coach Barry Switzer wanted to give kicker Chris Boniol a chance to tie the then-NFL record for most field goals in a game (seven). Similarly, during the 2011 Saints&#x27; 62–7 victory, while the margin of victory was very large and the game was almost beyond doubt at halftime, Drew Brees had thrown below his average number of yards. Keeping him and the first offense playing contributed towards his breaking of the single season all time passing record later in the year, and edging out Tom Brady who also broke the old record that season. While it may be considered derisive to the opponents for coaches to push for records, they are a mark in history for the players and the coaches and it is generally accepted among critics that chasing records is not bad sportsmanship or running up the score per se.

While some teams who regularly score very large number of points are occasionally criticized for running up the score, it is debatable at exactly what point scoring additional points becomes running up the score. Given recent comebacks such as The Miracle at the New Meadowlands and Super Bowl LI, and how quickly points can be accumulated (through interception returns, onside kicks and kick returns), it is understandable that coaches are cautious about becoming overconfident in their offenses and they normally prefer to run out the clock rather than risk an unlikely but certainly possible comeback late in the game, particularly for teams who have a strong offense but a weaker defense.

During the 2011 season, the three teams with the best offenses (New England, Green Bay and New Orleans) also had the worst defenses, which explains why none of those teams were happy to run out the clock, instead always pressuring for points. The current salary cap rules mean that it is nearly impossible for a team to have an excellent offense and defense over any period of time, particularly as cheaper players who play very well one year will likely cost more in the next year. Such tactics are generally referred to as &#x27;Keeping their foot on the gas&#x27;, and is generally not frowned upon in the NFL.

The most egregious known case of running up the score in professional football is believed to have taken place in 1904, when the Massillon Tigers, in the pre-forward pass era, racked up 26 touchdowns and 18 extra points to amass a score of 148–0 against a team from Marion, Ohio. (Touchdowns only counted five points in this era.) A similar rout had occurred in 1903 when the Watertown Red &amp; Black obliterated an opponent from Cortland, New York by a score of 142–0. Under then-current rules, the team that had scored &quot;received&quot; the kickoff instead of kicking it as it is today; however, it was much easier and more common to perform onside kicks in this era, and as far as it&#x27;s known, neither Marion nor Cortland attempted one. As such, neither team ever touched the ball after receiving the opening possession. The third-highest total in professional football history is much more recent, and happened in an indoor football game, where scores tend to be much higher than in the traditional outdoor game. In 2011, the Erie Explosion indoor football team racked up 138 points in a shutout victory over the Fayetteville Force. Having blown out the Force 42–0 in the first quarter alone thanks to three Force pick-sixes (including one achieved by a lateral), the Explosion continued to pile on, offering free tickets if the Explosion hit 100 points; when the players and head coach Shawn Liotta were told that the indoor record was 133 points (they were not informed of the overall pro record), they decided to attempt to break it, a feat they succeeded in achieving.

There is one definite instance of running up the score in NFL History. In 1987, during the NFL strike, the Dallas Cowboys had many starters cross the picket line such as Hall of Famers Randy White and Tony Dorsett, and starting QB Danny White. The Cowboys destroyed the Eagles 41–22 in one of the three strike games played in the 1987 season. To get back at the Cowboys, when the teams faced off again later in the season, Coach Buddy Ryan called a passing play on 3rd down with 1:00 left to play in the game after taking a knee on first and second down, even though the Eagles had the game won at 30–20. The pass was incomplete but was called for pass interference, moving the Eagles to the 1 yard line, where the foul was called. The Eagles then proceeded to score another touchdown and finish the game 37–20. Because both teams finished 7–8 and failed to make the playoffs that season, this moment is not remembered as much as the 1987 Replacement game between the Washington Redskins and the Dallas Cowboys. This moment was also overshadowed by the future success of the Eagles, the Cowboys&#x27; failures in the late 1980s, and Buddy Ryan&#x27;s heavily publicized feud against his former coach Mike Ditka.

==In other sports==

===Basketball===
In basketball, some coaches of vastly superior teams team will keep in their starters in the latter stages of a grossly one-sided game (e.g., less than ten minutes left in the second half of a college game; or well into the fourth quarter of a high school or NBA game). Players may be told to continue to aggressively apply full-court pressure (in order to steal the ball), block shots, break away for slam dunks, or try three-point baskets and other fan-pleasing shots.

A team that is trailing by an undefined margin sometimes may prolong the game by fouling the opponent on every possession, in an effort to extend its chances of a comeback — although teams that utilize this strategy often do so only when the game is still somewhat competitive. However, this strategy does not always work, particularly if the fouled players or team is able to connect on free throws.

In cases where the score is lopsided much earlier in the game, the most common option is to just &quot;play it out&quot; as if it were a scrimmage, by trying to take the best shot possible and also attempt some sort of defense (without any taboos against fan-pleasing shots and plays). This is usually referred to as &quot;garbage time&quot;, and while generally frowned upon for a lack of excitement it is considered to be the best way of ending a thoroughly uncompetitive game with minimal amounts of pride lost by the weaker side.

Running up the score was a key element in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl on December 16, 2006, as New York coach Isiah Thomas accused Denver coach George Karl of implementing it late in the game. Karl defended himself by citing many games where his team had lost large leads late.

Former Oklahoma Sooners basketball coach Billy Tubbs was often accused of running up the score against inferior opponents. On November 29, 1989, Tubbs&#x27; team went so far as to score 97 points in the first half of a game against U.S. International. Oklahoma won the game in a 173–101 rout. Asked repeatedly about running up the score against opponents, Tubbs once famously replied, &quot;If they don&#x27;t like it, they should get better.&quot;

Occasionally, teams will run up the score because of crowd encouragement. Crowd encouragement can occur whether or not there is a physical incentive involved. Often, a crowd will start chanting &quot;X more points&quot; near the end of a game, where X is the number of points needed to reach 100. This usually occurs when the team is within 5 points of reaching the 100-point mark. Also, crowd encouragement can happen as the result of a promotion for ticket-holders. In a Bradley home game against Wichita State, coach Jim Les put in some reserve players during the last 1–2 minutes of the game after the score got to 62–50. During the final possession, the crowd started to yell &quot;Shoot shoot shoot&quot; because the season ticket-holders would get a buy-one-get-one-free rib-eye steak dinner at a local restaurant if the score reached 63. One of the Bradley players launched a buzzer-beating 3 because of the crowd encouragement and it went in, making the final score 65–50. Similarly, during a 2014 game against Southern Virginia, BYU basketball led 98–48 with the clock running down. In response to chants of &quot;Hundred! Hundred!&quot; from the student section, Cougar reserve guard Jake Toolson launched a deep three-pointer as time expired. It was good, making the final score 101–48. Although the BYU fans and bench reacted with delight, Cougar head coach Dave Rose was upset by the incident. Toolson himself was privately reprimanded.

===Baseball===
The unwritten rules of baseball discourage a team from sacrifice bunting, stealing bases, or other small ball tactics when leading by a large margin late in a game, even though a losing team can theoretically come back from any deficit to win. Batters do not specifically try to make outs (e.g. by swinging at pitches with no intent to hit them) as this would insult the opposing team, violate the spirit of the game, and hurt their own batting average. The bottom of the ninth inning is not played if the home team leads after the top of the ninth inning, preventing pointless score run-ups when the team&#x27;s victory is already assured.

In a 2021 game where the visiting Chicago White Sox led the Minnesota Twins 15-4 late in the game, the Twins put in Willians Astudillo, a position utility player who normally would not pitch, on the mound for the last inning, a move traditionally seen under the game&#x27;s unwritten rules as conceding it, to which batters customarily respond by not trying too hard to get hits so the game will end more quickly and without further humiliation to the losing team. After Astudillo had gotten the first two White Sox batters out, rookie catcher Yermín Mercedes came to the plate for what was expected to be the game&#x27;s final out. On a 3-0 count, Astudillo threw a slow pitch over the plate. Mercedes swung his bat, itself a violation of the unwritten rules in that situation, and hit a home run. The Twins were greatly angered, and Sox manager Tony LaRussa promised Mercedes would be advised not to do so in the future.

Amateur, high school, and international baseball games often have a mercy rule so that games end sooner when the lead is deemed to be insurmountable (e.g. by 10 runs after 5 innings). However, since the home team always gets one final at-bat if they are trailing, the visiting team can in theory score unlimited runs in the top half of the inning.

===Cricket===
The nature of cricket with teams alternating either one or two innings and how games are limited by time or overs means that running up the score does not exist as a meaningful term within the sport. Teams seek to score the largest amount of runs within their specified time frame or before their wickets are taken by the opposition, as long as the time taken to acquire the runs does not impact on the tactical considerations for winning the game. In limited overs cricket rulesets such as One Day International and Twenty20 each team only get one chance to bat and have a set amount of overs to do so, requiring the team batting first to post the largest run total they can produce. Teams may elect to play more aggressively due to conditions or with the aim of increasing their net run rate in the event a tiebreaker is required for further qualification within a tournament but these attempts may instead cause a team to give away their wickets making overly aggressive shots.

In Test cricket and first-class cricket with long hours of play per day and multiple days per match teams can accumulate runs for as long as they can avoid losing their wickets. An excessive accumulation of runs by one team will increase the likelihood of a draw where the full allocation of innings is not completed. Tactical considerations see teams declare their innings closed before all their batsmen are dismissed. The first innings in particular is known for excessive scoring and the &quot;follow-on&quot; rule encourages teams to stay on the pitch. If the team who batted first have a high enough lead when their opposition are dismissed in the second innings, the team who are still in the lead can elect to &quot;enforce the follow on&quot;, requiring their opponents to bat again. If the team batting again fail to reach the total, they lose &quot;by an innings&quot; and the runs remaining and the team who enforced the follow on are not required to bat again.

Individual players may feel they have scored enough runs already during their innings and elect to retire out. This action is considered unsporting when there are no extenuating circumstances such as an illness or injury. It is subsequently extremely rare. It has only occurred twice in Test Cricket, in the same game where Marvan Atapattu (scoring 201) and Mahela Jayawardene (150) retired against a highly inferior Bangladesh team.

===Curling===
One of the unique rules of curling allows for the losing team to concede a match at any time, thereby preventing blowouts from occurring. In fact, it is sometimes considered unsportsmanlike for a team that is losing badly to not concede. For some major events, a game must play a certain amount of ends to be considered complete. As a protest, some teams that would have conceded earlier in the match may not take the game seriously at that point.

Before teams were allowed to concede matches well before the normal end of the game, blowouts were common.

===Ice hockey===
In ice hockey, complaints are quite rare, for the simple reason that unless there is a gross disparity in skill, teams generally do not score large numbers of goals at will against the opposition. A mercy rule also may come into effect at pre-high-school levels, where such disparities might come into play as a matter of course. Another tactic could be the coach of the leading team telling his team that everybody must touch the puck before a shot is taken.

===Lacrosse===

High scores, and wide margins of victory, are not uncommon in field lacrosse. While there is no mercy rule ending the game at a certain point, in American high school lacrosse the game is played in running time, with the clock stopped only for timeouts and injuries, should one team open up a lead of 12 goals or more in the second half.

Teams have been criticized for high scores at the expense of weak opponents. In a 2019 college game, NCAA Division II Colorado Mesa (CMU) defeated Division III Johnson &amp; Wales-Denver (J&amp;W) 52–0, setting an NCAA record for most goals, and largest margin of victory, in &quot;any&quot; college men&#x27;s lacrosse game at any level. Among many of the game&#x27;s lopsided statistics, Johnson &amp; Wales was unable to get a single shot while the victors recorded 81 (68 of which were on goal), won all but three of 56 face-offs and picked up all but nine of 81 ground balls. Twenty-one of Mesa&#x27;s players scored at least once, more than all the players J&amp;W put on the field. The game was ended early in the fourth quarter after a Mesa player was injured seriously enough to require hospitalization following the game&#x27;s final goal.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said it was &quot;perhaps the most one-sided game in the history of NCAA sports&quot;, rivaling the Cumberland-Georgia Tech game. CMU was criticized for continuing to shoot on goal and not letting the shot clock (a new rule in NCAA men&#x27;s lacrosse that season) expire. The university&#x27;s athletic department later issued a statement apologizing for &quot;the unsportsmanlike nature of the final score&quot;, saying that the team&#x27;s coaches regret the decisions they made which contributed to that outcome and players and fans &quot;deserve better&quot;.

===Association football===
In professional association football or soccer, the concept of &quot;running up the score&quot; is mostly unheard of; many league competitions use goal difference or goal average as a tiebreaker, meaning there is incentive for a dominant side to win by as wide a margin of victory as possible. Nevertheless, large victory margins have sometimes been criticized in the women&#x27;s game.

The 2002 World Cup qualification match between Australia and American Samoa ended 31–0 for the Socceroos, setting a record for the largest victory in an international association football match that still stands today. The vast gulf in quality was known well before the match began, with Australia unhappy at having to play games against small island nations in the Pacific, with this and other lopsided contests contributing towards the reintroduction of a preliminary round for smaller teams in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and eventually the move of Australia out of the Oceanian confederation into the more competitive Asian Football Confederation.

After the U.S. women&#x27;s team defeated Thailand 13–0 in the opening round of the 2019 World Cup, setting records for both the most goals scored and the largest margin of victory in either World Cup, the team faced accusations that it had run up the score, especially since players had celebrated the later goals, including Alex Morgan&#x27;s fifth goal, in the game&#x27;s 87th minute, as enthusiastically as they had celebrated the earlier ones. Critics noted that many of the Thai players had been crying as the game ended. Former Canadian international Clare Rustad called the American women&#x27;s conduct &quot;disgraceful&quot; on The Sports Network, where Kate Beirness added her complaint that Morgan&#x27;s holding up five fingers to celebrate her last goal was &quot;just unacceptable&quot;.

While former U.S. star Hope Solo defended the outcome—&quot;When you respect your opponent you don&#x27;t all of a sudden sit back and try not to score&quot;—she admitted that some of the celebrations, particularly those that appeared planned, &quot;seemed a little overboard.&quot; She found, in contrast, the postgame embrace Carli Lloyd offered Thai goalkeeper Chor Charoenying after scoring the final goal in the 92nd minute to be more emblematic of the team&#x27;s values.

U.S. coach Jill Ellis defended her players by noting both the importance of goal differential in determining seeding for the tournament&#x27;s elimination rounds and the need to build her team&#x27;s confidence, as she was able to play some substitutes. &quot;I don&#x27;t find it my job to harness my players and rein them in, because this is what they’ve dreamed about, and this is a world championship,&quot; she told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;When you have a deluge of goals like that, it&#x27;s important.&quot; Her Thai counterpart, Nuengruethai Sathongwien, also defended the American players, who she noted had encouraged her clearly overmatched team to keep their spirits up.

Ellis also suggested that sexism was at work, wondering if as many questions about the scoring and celebrations would have been raised had a men&#x27;s team won so dominantly. &quot;Stop judging these women with patriarchal glasses,&quot; another former American star, Abby Wambach, tweeted. &quot;You would never say this about a men&#x27;s team.&quot; However, former U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, also now a television soccer analyst, said &quot;yes we would&quot;. He feared that the celebrations and the goals had cost the U.S. team fans and &quot;sealed themselves as villains&quot; of the Cup.

Six days later, when the U.S. team beat Chile 3–0, the scoring players and their teammates celebrated their goals with hugs, followed by golf claps.

England defeated Latvia 20–0 in the 2023 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and were criticized for running up the score. While the English team consisted of full-time professionals, the Latvians were largely amateurs. The mother of one of the Latvian players lamented the &quot;unnecessary humiliation&quot;. The Belgian team had defeated Armenia 19–0 in the same qualifying series, and though they did not see similar criticism, UEFA said both incidents had led to the decision to change its qualifying format so that teams would not encounter those of a vastly different level.

===Australian rules football===
There is no negative stigma associated with running up the score in Australian rules football, as the sport lacks any obvious means to kill off a match quickly and painlessly, and time-wasting is both unpopular with fans and discouraged by the laws of the game.

The only tiebreaker used in most leagues is the ratio of points for versus points against (known in the code as &quot;percentage&quot;), a system that encourages teams to record large scores and winning margins, occurring frequently when there is a large disparity between ability. Running up the score occurs in all levels of play, but it is particularly prevalent in metropolitan and country leagues, where weaker teams can often be beaten by margins of 200 points or more.

==American high school sports==
Vast talent discrepancies between opponents happen more often in high school sports than in college or professional sports. This is especially prevalent in district competition (where schools of similar size are grouped based on geography) and regional single-elimination tournaments in which all schools (regardless of record) participate. It is even more prevalent in Kentucky high school basketball, in which a single state championship for each sex is conducted; this in turn means that district and regional competitions, and even the state tournaments, will feature games involving schools that differ vastly in enrollment. Often, a state&#x27;s athletic association will seed a vastly superior team (one that has gone undefeated or has very few losses) against a very weak team in the first round (so as to avoid early-round matchups between high-seeded teams, hoping to leave those matchups for later rounds), and the talent disparity between the two teams quickly becomes obvious. (Kentucky has never seeded its state tournaments, using a blind draw to fill its brackets.)

One notorious example of many such incidents that happen each year throughout the United States was the state-ranked Walkerville High School (enrollment 98) 115–2 victory against Lakeshore Academy (enrollment 49), in a Class D district game in the 2002 Michigan High School Girls&#x27; Basketball state tournament.

In light of similar incidents, coaches are often accused of running up the score and taking the opportunity to humiliate and embarrass a weak opponent. At times, large margins of victory occur in games where the winning school&#x27;s reserves (second-string and junior varsity players) played a good share of the contest and simply were able to score at will against the weaker opposition. However, when the star players are left in to set scoring records, as happened with Epiphanny Prince&#x27;s 113-point basketball game in 2006, criticism usually follows.

Since 2006, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has considered any victory margin of 50 points or more in a football game to be unsportsmanlike. If this occurs, the winning team&#x27;s coach will be suspended for the team&#x27;s next game. This was in response to one coach, Jack Cochran of New London, whose teams won that way four times during 2005. During the 2005 season, Jack Cochran&#x27;s New London High School football team, the highest scoring offense in CT, was shut out 16–0 by the Windham High School Whippets. In response to being shut out for the first time in his career, the following week Cochran had his team run up the score 90–0 against a much weaker opponent. The victory provoked a brawl and led to disorderly conduct charges against the losing coach. Coach Cochran defended himself by saying that in one 90–0 blowout, he had tried to get both teams and the timekeeper to run the clock continuously, as is done in Iowa when one team has a 35-point lead. The CIAC considered a similar proposal but rejected as several members felt it would cut into backups&#x27; playing time.

During a 2007 Kansas State High School Activities Association playoff game, Smith Center High School set a National Federation of State High School Associations record by scoring 72 points in the first quarter vs. Plainville. Coincidentally, the same two teams played each other only 25 days prior to the playoff contest, with Smith Center winning 72–0. During the regular season game, a continuous clock was triggered when the score differential reached 40 points, but there was no such provision in the rules at the time for its use in the playoffs. Smith Center administrators called the KSHSAA office and received permission to use the running clock starting with the second quarter of the second game with Plainville. (To avoid a recurrence, in 2011 the KSHSAA adopted a modified mercy rule for the playoffs, stating any 11-man postseason contest prior to the championship game would use a running clock in the second half once the margin reached 45 points.)

In October 2008, Naples High School defeated Estero High School, Florida 91–0. Naples was the defending Florida High School Athletic Association Class 3A champion. Despite accusations that Naples ran up the score, Coach Bill Kramer kept most of his star players out of the game for most, if not all of the game. Some Naples parents consequently called the coach to complain that their sons did not play. Five years later, in 2013, another 91–0 score between district opponents Aledo (who would ultimately win the state title, one of its state record eight) and Western Hills (who would go winless on the season) led a parent of the losing Western Hills team to file bullying charges with the Aledo school district against the Aledo head coach.

In a January 13, 2009 girls&#x27; basketball game, Covenant School of Dallas defeated Dallas Academy 100–0.

In 1926, Haven High School of Haven, Kansas defeated Sylvia High School by a score of 256–0, the highest recorded score in the history of American football.

On January 5, 2015, the San Bernardino Arroyo Valley (CA) High School girls&#x27; basketball team obliterated Bloomington High by a score of 161–2. Ten days later, San Bernardino suspended coach Michael Anderson for two games.

On September 17, 2021, the Coronado (CA) High School Football team defeated Kearny High with a score of 78–0. Coronado had a 41-point first quarter, setting a high score margin early in the game. Kearny then continued their streak of losing by a large margin, losing 76-0 during their next game against San Diego High on September 24.

In an October 29, 2021 football game, Inglewood High School defeated Morningside High School by the lopsided score of 106–0 in a game that included 13 touchdown passes. The California Interscholastic Federation-Southern Section condemned the contest and Inglewood High&#x27;s principal issued an apology. Ironically, in 1990, Morningside scored 102 points in the first half of a girls’ basketball game against South Torrance. South Torrance refused to come back out after halftime to finish the game. The final score was 102–24.

==Stat padding==
Stat padding is an action that improves a player&#x27;s statistics despite being of little benefit to their team or its chance of winning. Examples include:

*Russell Westbrook holds the record for most career triple-doubles in the NBA, most of which involved heavy stat padding, many theorise.
*Giannis Antetokounmpo was accused of stat padding after what was judged as his intentionally missed last-second shot (and subsequent catching of the ball) in order to get the rebound he needed to secure a triple-double. The rebound was later rescinded by the NBA.
*LSU Tigers football left their starting quarterback Jayden Daniels in the game while dominating their Sun Belt Conference opponent, the Georgia State Panthers in week 12 of the 2023 college football season. Multiple observers noted the move as potential stat padding to improve Daniels&#x27;s Heisman candidacy.

==Non-sporting examples==
James Holzhauer was noted for ostensibly running up the score during his run on the game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, continuing to make aggressive wagers even after it was clear the game was a &quot;runaway victory&quot;, a term used by the &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; fanbase to indicate that, even if the other two contestants bet all their winnings in Final Jeopardy!, they would not overcome Holzhauer&#x27;s leading Double Jeopardy! score. Indeed, to ensure an overall win Holzhauer only needed to bet the difference between his and two times the second-place winnings, minus $1. In this case however, running up the score is not in bad faith: because winners are awarded the actual dollar figure they earn during the show, Holzhauer had a legitimate financial incentive to maximize his winnings.

Running up the score is especially alluring in games where prizes are open-ended, or where a game&#x27;s rules can be exploited to continuously win new opportunities to win additional money or prizes (as Michael Larson did in his 1984 &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; appearance; he had memorized the board to keep winning money that came with additional board spins). In games that operate on a point system, while a score can still be run up, there is less incentive to do so, since the prize is fixed; most games that operate on a ladder or jackpot system for prizes cannot be run up.

<text>Francis Hoyt Gregory (October 9, 1789 – October 4, 1866) was an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812 through to the Civil War, serving then as a rear admiral.

==Early life==
Gregory was born in Norwalk, Connecticut, the son of Moses Gregory and Esther Hoyt. He was the third great-grandson of John Gregory, founding settler of Norwalk. While in the American merchant marine, he was impressed by the British in an incident typical of those which led in part to the War of 1812. After escaping, Gregory was appointed a midshipman on January 16, 1809, by President Jefferson and reported to the &quot;Revenge&quot;, commanded by Oliver Hazard Perry.

==Anti-Piracy operations==
In March, 1809, Gregory was transferred to the Gulf Squadron at New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1811, while serving in the &quot;Vesuvius&quot; and as acting captain of Gun Boat 162, Gregory participated in three notable actions. On August 7, off Pensacola, Midshipman Gregory attacked and crippled the pirate schooner &quot;La Franchise&quot;. On August 10, off Mobile, he attacked and captured the pirate schooner &quot;Santa Maria&quot;. On September 11, between Brassa and Barataria, Louisiana, Midshipman Gregory and his crew captured the pirate ship &quot;La Divina&quot;, and the schooners &quot;La Sophie&quot; and &quot;Le Vengeance&quot;.

==War of 1812==
During the War of 1812 between America and Britain. Gregory conducted maritime guerrilla operations against the British.

===Raiding the Black Snake===
On June 15, 1814, Francis Gregory and his fellow American sailors set out with 3 gigs. The Americans landed on Tar Island and hid their boats in the scrub undergrowth. Gregory and his fellow raiders observed from their hidden post. In the morning, Gregory spotted a British vessel called the Black Snaked manned by 20 Royal Marines and Canadian militia. The Americans approached the vessel by their gigs. The British crew spotted the gigs. The American raiders pretended to be fellow British sailors and waved at them in a friendly way. The British crew thinking it was a friendly vessel that was part of a British convoy allowed the American gigs to come closer. At Gregory’s signal, the Americans jumped the Black Snake and captured all 20 British marines and Canadian militia. One British marine was badly injured. The Americans suffered no casualties. While the Americans in their gigs were transporting their prisoners and prize vessel Black Snake. Two British gunboats with 150 heavily armed British sailors arrived seeking to retake the vessel. Gregory realized he would be overtaken as the 150 British sailors in their gunboats were catching up. So Gregory moved all of his prisoners on to his gigs and sank the Black Snake. The Black Snake sank rapidly and slowed the British who were distracted into salvaging the sunken vessel as the American raiders escaped. The American raiders arrived safely with their 20 prisoners at Sackets Harbor the next morning. In May 4, 1834. Gregory and his raiders were awarded by the U.S. government $3,000 for this successful maritime guerrilla raid.

===Sabotaging a British Schooner===
In Gregory’s next maritime guerrilla operation, he and his raiders were ordered to sabotage and destroy a British schooner that was under construction and being built for 14 guns. On July 1, 1814, Gregory set out with his fellow raiders. After the American raiders sailed and hid out of sight. They rowed for the small harbor where the British schooner sat on the stocks, surrounded by houses. The Americans slipped into the dark harbor and landed without notice. Gregory placed scouts at the edge of nearby homes and sent the rest of his force under the schooner to set fire combustibles. Gregory’s raiders inspected the ship as they set the fire explosives. The Schooner looked like it was ready to launch in two weeks after construction. The American raiders returned to their boats as the flames of the combustible explosives engulfed and destroyed the schooner. A storehouse containing supplies for the shipyard was also burned by the combustibles. The American raiders returned safely back to Sackets Harbor.

===Raiding and destroying a raft of timber before being captured===
In August 26,1814, Gregory and his fellow raiders went out on another maritime guerrilla operation. Gregory and his fellow raiders were silently rowing. They spotted a British civilian transporting a raft of timber. Gregory did not want to pass this target of opportunity and surprised the British sailor. Gregory’s raiders captured the British sailor and burned the raft of timber. The American raiders rowed on as stealthily as they could before hidden British vessels with armed sailors spotted them. The British gave chase. Gregory knowing that the British always put effort into saving or salvaging sinking British sailors or vessels decided to conduct a ploy. Gregory pushed the British prisoner he had captured into the water to distract the pursuers. The British sailors seeing through the deception threw an oar for the sailor to float on and continued to pursue the raiders. The British sailors fired their rifles with good accuracy at the fleeing American raiders. Four of the eight Americans were wounded and another killed. Gregory seeing no hope for escape surrendered. All the American raiders were taken prisoner. Gregory was British custody and refused parole.

===End of the war and release===
After being sent to England, Gregory remained there until June 1815, months after the end of hostilities. He was finally released.

==Command assignments, 1820s to early 1830s==
After he was released by the British, Gregory joined the Mediterranean Squadron and operated along the North African coast until 1821. In that year, he became captain of &quot;Grampus&quot; and spent the following two years cruising the West Indies to suppress piracy. While in the Indies, Gregory captured the notorious pirate brig &quot;Panchita&quot; and destroyed several other pirate ships. In 1824, Gregory fitted out the frigate &quot;Brandywine&quot;, destined to carry the Marquis de la Fayette back to France. In 1826 Gregory sailed a 64-gun frigate named HELLAS from Christopher Bergh&#x27;s shipyard in New York City&#x27;s lower East Side to Greece for the revolutionary government. The Hellas became the Greek Navy&#x27;s first flagship, fighting for the country&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire. From 1824 to 1828 Gregory served at the New York Navy Yard, and in 1831 reported to the Pacific Station for a three-year cruise in command of &quot;Falmouth&quot;. Gregory served as commander of the Station for one year.

==Command assignments, late 1830s to 1850s==
From the Pacific Ocean, Gregory—appointed a Captain in 1838—sailed to the Gulf of Mexico, where he commanded &quot;North Carolina&quot; and &quot;Raritan&quot; and served in the blockade of the Mexican coast during the Mexican–American War.

After the Mexican War, Gregory commanded the squadron off the African coast, with &quot;Portsmouth&quot; as his flagship, until June 1851. Returning to the United States, he became commandant of the Boston Navy Yard in May 1852 and served there through February 1856. His subsequent retirement ended a Navy career that had spanned nearly 50 years.

==Civil War duty and last years==
When the Civil War rolled across the land, Gregory returned to naval service to superintend the construction and fitting-out of naval vessels in private shipyards, including iron-clad vessels. Promoted to Rear Admiral July 16, 1862, he served throughout the four years of war and then retired again.

Rear Admiral Gregory died in Brooklyn, New York, on October 4, 1866, and was buried at New Haven, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
Two ships were named USS &quot;Gregory&quot; for him.

There is an old family story related to Admiral Gregory during his imprisonment in England during the War of 1812.

He had been placed under &quot;house arrest&quot; at a country estate, where he lived by a gentleman&#x27;s agreement not to attempt escape by passing beyond certain boundaries, one of which was defined by a large stone marker. At some point, there was a formal dinner party at another estate a mile or so away that the captain wished to attend, yet was beyond the set boundary.

The dinner guests were surprised during the party by the arrival of the American captain, and he was accused of violating the terms of his incarceration by going beyond the marker.

The captain smilingly ushered the complainants outside...where they found a wheelbarrow parked at the far corner of the house containing the large marker stone.

Admiral Gregory was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Captain John Shaw, an early naval commander and a hero of the 1st Barbary Coast campaign and the War of 1812.

<doc id="956806" wikidata="Q7866910" url="?curid=956806" title="USRC Vigilant (1791)">
<text>Vigilant (launched 1791) was one of the original ten cutters employed by the Federal government of the United States which made up the Revenue Marine, or Revenue Cutter Service, later to become the United States Coast Guard.

==Operational history==
&quot;Vigilant&quot; was one of the first ten revenue cutters authorized by Congress and was probably the first cutter launched. She was not, however, the first to enter into active service. The first mention of her on an actual patrol as a revenue cutter was not until 23 December 1791 when her crew boarded a Royal Navy schooner as it entered the port of New York, the &quot;Vigilant&quot;″s homeport. Patrick Dennis was appointed the master of the new revenue cutter on 6 October 1790 and oversaw her construction. He served as her commanding officer until his death, of unknown causes, on 9 February 1798.

Little documentation survives regarding her service life but she apparently carried out her assigned duties as described above along the Hudson River as far as Albany, in New York Harbor itself, along the coastline of New York and New Jersey, and &quot;through Hell Gate to Long Island Sound except Sagg harbor.&quot; There is some remaining information regarding her role in a celebrated naval engagement between the French frigate &quot;Ambuscade&quot; and the Royal Navy frigate &quot;Boston&quot; during the long war between England and France. On a summer day in 1793 &quot;Vigilant&quot; was patrolling off Sandy Hook when a frigate, flying French colors, ordered the cutter to hove to. Two American prisoners on board the frigate described what happened:

The New York revenue cutter, Captain Dennis, was brought to by the &quot;Boston&quot;. The frigate under French colours, and the crew having the national cockade in their hats. Capt. Cortnay, in French, asked Capt. Dennis, who was not to be deceived, answered that he conceived the &quot;Boston&quot; looked more like an English armed vessel than any on the coast. Upon this Capt. Courtnay enquired what French vessels were in New York. Captain Dennis answered that the principal was the &quot;Ambuscade&quot; frigate: well, says Courtnay tell Capt. Bompard that I had come all the way from Halifax on purpose to take the &quot;Ambuscade&quot; and I shall be very happy to see her out of the way. Shall I tell him that? yet asked Dennis; Yes, to be sure answered the first lieutenant. Capt. Dennis delivered the message to Bompard at the Coffee House.

Bompard accepted the British offer and sailed off to battle &quot;Boston&quot;. After breaking off the engagement in which &quot;Boston&quot; was damaged more severely and her captain killed, &quot;Ambuscade&quot; sailed back to New York Harbor.

&quot;Vigilant&quot; was sold at auction on 14 November 1798 for £348 after it was determined that she was too small and too lightly armed to carry out her assigned duties in the busiest port of the new nation. There is no further documentation regarding her ultimate fate.

<doc id="956822" wikidata="Q1184024" url="?curid=956822" title="Sarutobi Sasuke">
<text>is a ninja who appears in kōdan narrative art and fictional writings. The nickname is generally believed to have been concocted sometime between the Meiji to the Taishō periods. Some argue he is based on real live personages, such as  and . His family name, meaning &quot;monkey jump&quot;, is written with two kanji; &quot;saru&quot; (猿) is the character for &quot;monkey&quot;, and &quot;tobi&quot; (飛) is the character for &quot;jump&quot;. He was known for his monkey-like agility and quickness, especially in trees. Many depictions portray him as having been orphaned and raised by a band of monkeys, therefore giving rise to the monkey-like abilities. He has been described as a superhero ninja, and caused a boom of ninjas in popular culture during the 1910s-1920s in Japan.

== In folklore ==
Sasuke is commonly listed as the leader of the Sanada Ten Braves, a fictional group of ten ninja that supposedly assisted the warlord Sanada Yukimura at the Siege of Osaka and he is by far the best known and most popular among them. When appearing with Kirigakure Saizō, one of his fellow Ten Braves, he is often thus contrasted with his best friend/arch-rival, who usually has an elegant, or at least clean-cut, appearance and magic-like ability. Sasuke is generally said to be a Kōga ninja, whereas Saizō is an Iga ninja. As such, when the two appear together, they are almost always depicted as arch-rivals and later, after being recruited to the Sanada cause, best friends. (This rivalry parallels the Iga-Kōga rivalry and the Hattori-Fūma rivalries in ninja fiction.) It is said he fell in battle against the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu during the Siege of Osaka in the summer of 1615; but there is no historical record of this. In another version, Sasuke infiltrated Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s stronghold during 1615 and, having caught his foot in a bear trap while escaping the enemy, cut it off at the ankle to escape and then took his own life rather than be captured.

== In popular culture ==

Sarutobi Sasuke&#x27;s image has been very influential in ninja fiction, in which he is usually portrayed as a young boy. The character was immortalized in contemporary Japanese culture by the popular Tachikawa Bunko (Pocket Books) children&#x27;s literature between 1911 and 1925, as well as in &quot;Sarutobi Sasuke&quot;, one of the more famous gag manga by Shigeru Sugiura from the 1950s (followed by &quot;Shōnen Jiraiya&quot;).

He has been described as a superhero ninja. By 1914, his abilities included superhuman strength, chanting incantations, appearing and disappearing, jumping to the top of the highest trees, riding on clouds, conjuring the elements (water, fire and wind), and transforming into other people or animals. His popularity caused a boom of ninjas in popular culture during the 1910s-1920s in Japan.

He is the title character of the films such as &quot;Ibun Sarutobi Sasuke&quot; (known in the west as &quot;Samurai Spy&quot;), &quot;Sânada Daisûke to Sarutobi Sasuke&quot;, &quot;Sarutobi no Ninjutsu&quot; and &quot;Sarutobi Sasuke Senjogadake no Himatsuri&quot;, as well as of several other movies simply named &quot;Sarutobi Sasuke&quot; in 1918, 1919, 1922, and 1966 (the last one also known as &quot;Ninja Spy&quot;). He is also the lead character in the musical film &quot;Brave Records of the Sanada Clan&quot;. Toei Animation&#x27;s second full-length movie was &quot;Shônen Sarutobi Sasuke&quot;, dealing with Sasuke&#x27;s childhood, which was followed by a TV series. This film was also the first time when both Sasuke and anime were introduced to the western audience (in 1961 as &quot;Magic Boy&quot;), although all the references to him being a ninja were removed in the English-language version. He is also the title character of an anime series &quot;Manga Sarutobi Sasuke&quot;, of the video game &quot;Ninja Boy Sasuke&quot;, and of Sanpei Shirato&#x27;s 1962 manga, as well as of the manga series &quot;I am Sarutobi!&quot; by the &quot;father of the modern manga&quot; Osamu Tezuka two years earlier.

An adult Sarutobi Sasuke is a character in the anime and manga series &quot;Samurai Deeper Kyo&quot;, in which he serves Sanada Yukimura as the leader of the Ten Braves – the same role he has in the manga and anime &quot;Brave 10&quot; and in the film &quot;Kamen Rider Den-O: I&#x27;m Born!&quot;. Sasuke also appeared in the historical anime and manga &quot;Shura no Toki&quot; (serving Sanada Tsubura), in the taiga drama series &quot;Tenchijin&quot;, in the anime &quot;Sanada Ten Braves&quot; and in the film &quot;Goemon&quot;. In the video game and anime series &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot;, and in its anime adaptations &quot;Sengoku Basara: The Last Party&quot; and &quot;Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings&quot;, he is portrayed as a laid-back but cunning ninja, aiding Yukimura. In the film &quot;Shogun Assassins&quot; (&quot;Sanada Yukimura no Bouryaku&quot;), Sasuke is even shown to be literally an anthropomorphized ninja monkey. The &quot;Ninja Sentai Kakuranger&quot; character Sasuke / Ninja Red and the title character of the manga series &quot;Sarutobi Ecchan&quot; are each portrayed as being direct descendants of Sarutobi Sasuke.

The very name Sasuke has become something of a default ninja name or moniker. For example, the sports entertainment show known in the other countries as &quot;Ninja Warrior&quot; is titled &quot;Sasuke&quot; in the original Japanese version, while Great Sasuke is stage name of the Japanese professional wrestler Masanori Murakawa. Various ninja characters by the name of either Sasuke or Sarutobi appear in the anime series &quot;Gin Tama&quot;, &quot;Haō Taikei Ryū Knight&quot;, &quot;Ninja Nonsense&quot; and &quot;Ranma ½&quot; (Sasuke Sarugakure), the video games &quot;Captain Commando&quot;, &quot;Ehrgeiz&quot;, &quot;Joy Mech Fight&quot; (as a ninja robot), &quot;Shall We Date?: Ninja Love&quot; (as a romance option for the player character), &quot;Gotcha Force&quot;, &quot;Kessen&quot; (as a female ninja), &quot;Ninja Master&#x27;s: Haō Ninpō Chō&quot; (where he is the protagonist), &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; and &quot;Suikoden II&quot;, in the &quot;Ganbare Goemon&quot; video game series (as another robot ninja), and in the trading card game &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;. His legacy is also almost omnipresent in the manga and anime franchise &quot;Naruto&quot; in which the father of a major supporting character, Hiruzen Sarutobi, is named Sasuke Sarutobi, hence making him the grandfather of Asuma Sarutobi (Hiruzen&#x27;s son) and the great-grandfather of Konohamaru (Asuma&#x27;s nephew). One of the main characters is named Sasuke Uchiha; it is mentioned that Sasuke was named after Sarutobi Sasuke in hopes that he would become a great shinobi just like him.

<text>A Day Without Rain is the fifth studio album by Irish singer-songwriter and musician Enya, released on 20 November 2000 by WEA in Europe and on 21 November 2000 by Reprise Records in the US. Following a promotional tour in support of her compilation albums &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and &quot;A Box of Dreams&quot; in late 1997, Enya started work on a new studio album in mid-1998 with her longtime recording partners, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. In a musical departure from her keyboard-oriented sound, Enya incorporates a string section in her songs.

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; received mixed reviews from critics; some felt it too derivative of Enya&#x27;s previous albums whilst others complimented the minimal use of overdubbing that her sound had become known for. It was a commercial success peaking at No. 6 in the United Kingdom and initially, No. 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States. Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, sales of the album and its lead single, &quot;Only Time&quot;, skyrocketed after it was used by several radio and television networks in their coverage and aftermath of the attacks. As a result, &quot;Only Time&quot; climbed to No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; reached a new peak on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 2. It became the fifth highest selling album of 2001 in the United States. To date, it remains Enya&#x27;s best-selling album in the United States, selling over 7 million copies.

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is the best selling new age album in history as well as Enya&#x27;s best selling album worldwide, with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide. Enya supported it with a promotional tour which included live televised performances. In 2002, the album won Enya her third Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.

==Background and recording==
Following a promotional tour in support of her two compilation albums &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; and &quot;A Box of Dreams&quot; at the end of 1997, Enya started work on a new studio album in the mid-1998 with her longtime recording partners, producer and arranger Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It marked her first studio album since &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; in 1995. Around the time of starting on &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, Enya questioned some decisions she had made in her life and found herself answering them in the songs she was writing. She compared the album to reading her own diary: &quot;Like in &#x27;Pilgrim&#x27; I was asking myself: So many years have passed, am I happy with the way I&#x27;m working? And my answer is that I wouldn&#x27;t change anything. I really love what I do.&quot;

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; was written and recorded in a similar way to Enya&#x27;s previous albums and without a timeline or deadline set by their label. She first spends time alone developing melodies and outlines of songs on the piano, which she then presents to the Ryans: &quot;I&#x27;m quite anxious at this point because it really is an act of laying your soul bare&quot;. While Roma starts to write lyrics to the melodies, Enya and Nicky develop them into completed arrangements. After two years&#x27; work, Enya felt it was time to &quot;step out of the studio ... time for it to have its life out in the world&quot;. The album was recorded at Aigle, the Ryan&#x27;s home studio in Killiney, County Dublin. Enya adopted a less intensive schedule, working just five days a week and having weekends off instead of working seven days like she had done on &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;. The change made her feel happier as a result.

In a musical departure from her keyboard-oriented sound, the album features a string section which Enya said was not a conscious decision initially. Nicky Ryan and she were open to exploring all possibilities with the songs, and stick with elements that give the best creative result. Most of the songs were written in the major key, as Enya believed it helped create a more positive and uplifting mood.

==Songs==
&quot;Flora&#x27;s Secret&quot; is a song that makes reference to Flora, the Roman mythological goddess of flowers. Enya and Roma incorporated some of Enya&#x27;s experiences from her own love life on &quot;Only Time&quot; and &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;. The former alludes to the difficulties and pressures of finding &quot;the perfect love&quot;, which Enya has found difficult throughout her career due to her private lifestyle and that her past relationships were not the right ones.

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; opens with an instrumental title track, which Enya had also done on her previous four studio albums. It was named after the high amount of rainfall over Ireland in the course of a year. After one particular stretch of consistent rain over a few days the sun came out, which inspired Enya to write it. She described its meaning as &quot;the mood of a particularly peaceful day&quot;. It was planned for the track to be a song and Roma had prepared an incomplete set of lyrics for it, but as the arrangement developed it was decided for it to remain instrumental. &quot;Wild Child&quot; is a song about embracing positivity and finding moments for yourself during difficult days. &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroí&quot; is Irish for &quot;Tears on My Heart&quot;.

Enya gave permission for &quot;Only Time&quot; to be included in the soundtrack to the romantic film &quot;Sweet November&quot; (2001) where one of the lead characters finds out they are dying of cancer. She agreed in connection with the death of Irish musician Frankie Kennedy, co-founder of the Celtic group Altan with his wife Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh, from bone cancer in 1994. Enya played synthesiser on their album &quot;Ceol Aduaidh&quot; (1983), and found Kennedy&#x27;s death particularly sad. &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot; is a darker and moody track in comparison to the opening three tracks that Enya said represents the fragility of life and how we are all together as one in its struggles.

&quot;Flora&#x27;s Secret&quot; is about two lovers laying on the grass on a romantic afternoon. Enya singled out &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; as her favourite track on &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;. She knew it was a particularly strong track when she presented it to Roma, who understood the emotion that she tried to put across musically. After Roma finished its lyrics, Enya recalled, &quot;It was so moving to actually sing them&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine rated it as Enya&#x27;s best vocal performance of her career at the time. The song is about the reminiscence of a lost love, &quot;a celebration of that special time and a lament that it is over.&quot; According to Roma Ryan, the lyrics to &quot;Pilgrim&quot; were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. The song is about a journey of self-discovery on a more broad scale.

&quot;The First of Autumn&quot; is an instrumental that gained inspiration from a poem Roma had written as part of a collection of poems about the seasons. Among them was a haiku that was first printed in the liner notes to Enya&#x27;s limited edition box set &quot;Only Time – The Collection&quot; (2002). The Japanese edition of the album includes &quot;Isobella&quot;, a song that Roma described as a song for &quot;A spirit child. One whom both Enya and myself experienced yet know nothing about&quot;, and named it Isobella.

==Release==
&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; received a launch party at Somerset House in London on 19 October 2000, where guests received a promotional CD of the album containing a personal organiser and a handmade frontispiece. It was released in the UK on 20 November 2000 on Warner Music. Its North American release followed on 21 November on Reprise Records. In the US, Reprise promoted &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; with an Internet-driven campaign that involved E-cards and Amazon.com pages with 30-second snippets of &quot;Only Time&quot;, exclusive displays offered at select retail stores, and a dedicated section of the label&#x27;s web page to the album. It went on to reach, before the 11 September attacks, an initial peak of No. 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in December 2000 and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;Only Time&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on 6 November 2000 in the United States and on 13 November 2000 in the United Kingdom. A promotional edition was shipped to adult contemporary radio stations across the US on 24 October, and the song premiered on the nationally-syndicated radio show &quot;Delilah&quot; on the same day. Its music video, directed by Graham Fink, was distributed to various music television networks from 31 October. The song gained nationwide radio airplay following its use in an episode of the drama series &quot;Providence&quot; and the soundtrack to &quot;Sweet November&quot; (2001). By October 2001, the single had spent 43 weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; New Age chart. The song, in April 2001, was remixed without authorisation with added electronic dance beats and keyboards by the Swiss American Federation (S.A.F.), a group formed of Los Angeles-based radio DJ and producer Christian Burkholder, a longtime Enya fan, and Marc Dold. The song received radio airplay in Los Angeles before it spread to stations across the country. When the song aired on WHTZ in New York City in June, other stations followed suit, which led to Burkholder being contacted by Nicky and Enya, who approved his remix. The second single released from &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, &quot;Wild Child&quot;, was issued on 19 March 2001. It charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart with a peak of No. 12. Its B-side, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, is originally an instrumental that was extended with added vocals. It was then renamed as the title track for Enya&#x27;s album &quot;And Winter Came...&quot; (2008).

In 2001, the album won Best International Pop Albums of the Year at the Japan Gold Disc Awards. In 2002, it won a Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.

===9/11 aftermath===
Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, &quot;Only Time&quot; was used in radio and television coverage of the disaster, which led to increased sales and radio airplay of the single and &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, to the point of both records surpassing their initial peak on the US charts. CNN and ABC News, among other networks, played the song with &quot;Fallen Embers&quot; as backdrops of footage of the victims. Its position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 climbed from No. 20 prior to the attacks to its all-time peak of No. 2, driven by the increased audience exposure of &quot;Only Time&quot;. In the same month, &quot;Only Time&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart after it already spent 33 weeks on the chart, breaking a seven-year-old record for the longest climb to the top position in the chart&#x27;s history. In November 2001, the single climbed to its peak of No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, making it Enya&#x27;s highest-charting single in the US. From October 2001 to January 2002, over 3 million RIAA-certified units of &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; were sold in the US alone, which included a peak of one million copies sold in 19 days.

&quot;Only Time&quot; gained further exposure following its use as a sound bed for promos of the comedy series &quot;Friends&quot; on the first five episodes of the eighth season. Following the media response and increased sales of Enya&#x27;s records, &quot;Only Time&quot; was reissued as a maxi-CD on 20 November 2001 containing the S.A.F remix and original version, with earnings from its sales donated to the Uniform Firefighters Association&#x27;s Widows&#x27; and Children&#x27;s Fund in aid of families of fire fighters involved in the attack rescue operations.

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; became the eight highest selling album worldwide in 2001, selling 6.6 million copies.
 It also was the top selling new age album of the 2000s in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It remains Enya&#x27;s highest selling album of her career with a total of 16 million copies sold worldwide.

===Critical reception===

&quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. In a review for &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, Mario Tarradell gave a rating of &quot;B+&quot;. He thought the album was worth the five-year wait since &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; and is &quot;another lovely piece of work&quot; from Enya. The title track is &quot;an elegant piano melody&quot; that is followed by &quot;dark-to-light, chaos-to-peace progression&quot; for the rest of the album. &quot;Lazy Days&quot;, he thought, was &quot;an engulfing pop song filled with swooshing flourishes that one-ups the hooky, wall-of-sound pull&quot; of Enya&#x27;s past singles &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; and &quot;Caribbean Blue&quot;. Tarradell finalises with the album is &quot;quintessential Enya&quot;. Fiona Shepherd reviewed the album for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and was more critical, writing Enya continues a &quot;policy of releasing the same album over and over again using a different title and cover&quot; with &quot;drab Celtic moods&quot;. She thought the album was not on par with her &quot;earlier epic stuff&quot;. A critical review appeared from Gavin Martin of &quot;The Mirror&quot;, who thought that the title track and &quot;Only Time&quot; would please her fans, but the album &quot;still sounds like undistinguished new age fodder ... The rest of us can go back to watching paint dry.&quot;

R.S. Murthi for &quot;New Straits Times&quot; gave a rating of two-and-a-half stars out of five for Enya&#x27;s performance and three out of five for the album&#x27;s sound quality. He wrote that the album is a &quot;ho-hum New Age effort&quot; with &quot;pretty melodies&quot; but, on the other hand, its &quot;dense textures conceal a compositional shallowness&quot;. He deemed some of the track titles &quot;pompous&quot; but the more successful songs, such as &quot;Deora Ar Mo Chroi&quot;, are so due to their traditional Celtic elements rather than Enya&#x27;s own compositions. Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; found it too derivative of Enya&#x27;s previous albums, which he found far superior to &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau panned the album as nonsense, &quot;goopier, more simplistic&quot; than &quot;Watermark&quot; (1988).

Steve Morse welcomed the album in a report for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;. He thought the album is &quot;arguably her best work because there is more emphasis on her gorgeous soprano lead vocals rather than the lush, multitracked harmony vocals&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the album&#x27;s production, writing the more experimental songs like &quot;Only Time&quot; and &quot;Lazy Days&quot; &quot;not only freshen a musical formula that still works extremely well but also leave the listener happily curious about Enya&#x27;s next move&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that the album sounded too similar to her previous releases and thought a change in musical direction after &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars&quot; would have been better. Her &quot;skill at ephemeral sonic watercolors has grown wearisome, like a relative who tells the same stories every holiday.&quot; In &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, J. D. Considine thought the album belonged in &quot;the same lush, contemplative vein&quot; as Enya&#x27;s previous albums, which he thought were formed of &quot;pretty but unconnected&quot; tracks. &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;, however, was more of a unified album that compared to &quot;a suite instead of a pop album&quot;. &quot;One by One&quot;, he thought, &quot;conveys all the qualities of a pop hit without succumbing to the typical transience of a Top-40 favorite&quot;. &quot;People&quot; recommended the &quot;masterful&quot; album for a &quot;rainy day&quot; because of Enya&#x27;s characteristic sound and tranquil mood.

<doc id="956838" wikidata="Q2307974" url="?curid=956838" title="Secrets of the Beehive">
<text>Secrets of the Beehive is the fourth studio album by English singer-songwriter David Sylvian. The album was released on 19 October 1987 in Europe and the United States. The album peaked at No. 37 in the UK album chart. The album was released in Japan on 21 November 1987.

== Background ==

The entire album was quickly written in about two inspired weeks shortly after Sylvian&#x27;s extensive press tour for &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, but for the recording Sylvian ran out of budget and was unable to complete the album the way he envisioned it. Sylvian said that although he liked the material on the album, it was &quot;something of a failure&quot; because the centerpiece was missing. The missing piece was the song &quot;Ride&quot;, which was later completed and finally released 2000 on the compilation album &quot;Everything and Nothing&quot;. Sylvian said: &quot;I was crushed when I wasn&#x27;t able to finish it first time around due to time and budget constraints.&quot;

Sylvian spent the first couple of months of 1987 making demo tapes of songs that would draw on the subtler sides of jazz, folk and orchestral music. Recorded in just 2.5 months &quot;Secrets Of The Beehive&quot; appeared in October 1987 to universally positive reviews. The emphasis was on the lyrical content more than on the previous albums. Because the material came so easily and had a certain strength in its simplicity, it didn’t require enhancing in terms of studio atmospherics and effects. Sylvian began recording the basic tracks at Chateau Miraval in the South of France because of its exotic location. David Torn, Danny Thompson, Ryuichi Sakamoto and Danny Cummings came down and built up the tracks one by one. In time they would be joined at the studio by Phil Palmer and Steve Jansen. The orchestral overdubs were recorded midway through the album, at Angel Studios and at Air in London. Sakamoto had scored the majority of the songs, except &quot;Orpheus&quot; and &quot;Let the Happiness In&quot;, were scored by arranger Brian Gascoigne. Mark Isham also recorded his parts at Angel and Air Studios. Then it was off to Wisseloord at Hilversum in the Netherlands to finish the overdubs and do the vocals. Final additions and mixing were done early summer 1987 at the Wool Hall in Bath with Steve Nye.

In 2003, a remastered limited digipak version of &quot;Secrets of the Beehive&quot; was released with the bonus track from the Japanese version &quot;Promise (The Cult of Eurydice)&quot; replacing the original CD bonus track &quot;Forbidden Colours (version)&quot;, which was a re-recorded version of the Sakamoto/Sylvian collaboration originally intended for &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, but eventually released as b-side to the &quot;Red Guitar&quot; single. In 2006 it was reissued in a standard jewel-case.

In February 2019, as part of a redesigned monochrome sleeved vinyl reissue batch of his 80s albums, &quot;Secrets&quot; &quot;of the Beehiv&quot;e was re-issued in a gatefold sleeve with different type fonts, but otherwise maintaining the original artwork.

<text>Brilliant Trees is the debut solo studio album by the English musician David Sylvian, released on 25 June 1984 by Virgin Records. The album peaked at number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

==History==

Produced by Sylvian with Steve Nye, &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; was Sylvian&#x27;s first studio album release after the break-up of his band Japan in December 1982 (though former Japan members Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri both appear on the album). AllMusic called the album &quot;an eclectic affair fusing funk, jazz, and ambient.&quot; Additional musicians on the album included Holger Czukay, Danny Thompson, Jon Hassell, Mark Isham, Ronny Drayton, Kenny Wheeler, Phil Palmer and Ryuichi Sakamoto of Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). Sylvian and Sakamoto had previously collaborated on the singles &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;, and continued to collaborate at various points in their careers.

&quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; was recorded August 1983 at Hansa in Berlin, and over about 6 weeks in London at the end of 1983 and the beginning of 1984. With the majority of vocal overdubs completed at The Church Studios in Crouch End, Sylvian and Nye then relocated to AIR Studios to begin mixing.

Lyrically, the album includes references to writers, thinkers and artistic figures who were influencing Sylvian at the time, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau. For instance, the song &quot;The Ink in the Well&quot; references Cocteau&#x27;s film &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; (1932) and Sartre&#x27;s novel &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; (1945). Many of the lyrics also express Sylvian&#x27;s searching explorations of spirituality in different forms.

For the recording of the album Sylvian decided to work with musicians he respected as a dedicated band, tailoring the arrangements around their involvement and giving them each a specific role, rather than hiring less passionate session musicians. A great admirer of Holger Czukay&#x27;s studio album &quot;Movies&quot; (1979), Sylvian also invited the German musician to contribute to the album. Czukay supplied the innovative samples played back on a dictaphone, and became a close friend of Sylvian.

==Release==
The album peaked at number 4 in the UK, the highest chart position of Sylvian&#x27;s career to date, and contains his biggest solo hit, &quot;Red Guitar&quot;, which reached number 17 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1994, ten years after its release, the album was certified Gold by the BPI for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

In 1994, the album was reissued in the US as &quot;Brilliant Trees / Words with the Shaman&quot;, which included the three part EP &quot;Words with the Shaman&quot; as bonus tracks; these songs were also included on the cassette-only album &quot;&quot; (1985). In 2003, a remastered limited digipak version of &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; was released. In 2006 it was reissued in a standard jewel-case. The album cover for both releases was altered to a cropped photo of Sylvian with new type fonts.

In February 2019, as part of a redesigned monochrome sleeved vinyl reissue batch of his 1980s albums, &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; was released in a gatefold sleeve, once again with a new set of type fonts. No new mastering was done for this; the 2003 remaster was used.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; was well received by the contemporary British music press. &quot;Sylvian has grown up,&quot; wrote &quot;Sounds&quot; critic Carole Linfield. &quot;He&#x27;s left art school, gone through the grey and come out in a spectrum of pastel shades that entrance and enthral. Gone is the clichéd imagery that once haunted Japan... in its place is a solo artist who deserves more respect than his beautiful face often allows.&quot; In an enthusiastic review, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Steve Sutherland, who had previously been critical of Sylvian&#x27;s work with Japan, concluded that &quot;&quot;Brilliant Trees&quot; inadvertently attains the stature Sylvian&#x27;s always sought. It&#x27;s a masterpiece.&quot;

Richard Cook for &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;private and intolerant – really, an astonishing statement from one in his position – but it is a transformation of thought into music which involves the finest skill, an uncanny talent.&quot; Betty Page for &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described it as &quot;all oh-so-fragile but meaty at the same time, obviously occasionally un peu pretentious, but very painstakingly crafted and built up with great care and affection.&quot;

Sylvian biographer Martin Power found that the Side two of the record required the listener to enter &quot;into new, more demanding territories&quot;.

<doc id="956854" wikidata="Q17118871" url="?curid=956854" title="Panfish">
<text>The word panfish, also spelled pan-fish or pan fish, is an American English term describing any edible freshwater fish that usually do not outgrow the size of an average frying pan. It is also commonly used by recreational anglers to refer to any small game fish that can fit wholly into a pan for cooking but are still large enough to be legal. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term was first recorded in 1796 in &quot;American Cookery&quot;, the first known cookbook written by an American author.

==Usage==

The term &quot;panfish&quot; or &quot;pan-fish&quot; has been used to refer to a wide range of edible freshwater and saltwater fish species that are small enough to cook whole in one frying pan. The fish species that match this definition and usage vary according to geography. One early-20th-century source identifies all the following as panfish: yellow perch, candlefish, balaos, sand launces, rock bass, bullheads, minnows, Rocky Mountain whitefish, sand rollers, crappie, yellow bass, white bass, croaker and most of the common small sunfishes such as bluegill and redear sunfish.

Here is one example:
As a pan-fish we do not know of any better among American freshwater fishes. We have experimented with the yellow perch and several other species, including both species of black bass, the bluegill, wall-eyed pike, and rock-bass, eating each for several days in succession, and found the yellow perch the sweetest and most delicious of them all. One does not tire of it so soon as of the other kinds. Several other persons who tried the same experiment reached the same conclusion. In most parts of its range it is highly esteemed, and in many places it is of very considerable commercial importance. In the Great Lakes, the Potomac River, and the small lakes in the upper Mississippi Valley large quantities are taken, which always find a ready sale.
The following is a typical example of the term as it was commonly used in cooking taken from &quot;The White House Cookbook&quot; compiled by Hugo Ziemann, chief kitchen steward in the White House in 1901:
TO FRY FISH – Most of the smaller fish (generally termed &quot;pan-fish&quot;) are usually fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and slice the body crosswise into five or six pieces; season with salt and pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs. Trout and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lard or drippings; fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. PAN-FISH.
Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one way. Fill
the spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite brown and ready
to turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off the fat; then invert the
pan, and they will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back into
the pan, and when hot slip back the fish. When the other side is brown,
drain, turn on a plate as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to be
sent to the table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, in
perfect shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with slices of lemon.
In most angling literature, members of the freshwater family &quot;Centrarchidae&quot; (also called sunfishes) are the target species most likely to be called panfish. They include:

* &quot;Lepomis&quot;, including
** Bluegill (&quot;Lepomis macrochirus&quot;)
** Green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;)
** Redear sunfish (&quot;Lepomis microlophus&quot;)
** Redbreast sunfish (&quot;Lepomis auritus&quot;)
** Spotted sunfish (&quot;Lepomis punctatus&quot;)
** Pumpkinseed (&quot;Lepomis gibbosus&quot;)
** Warmouth (&quot;Chaenobryttus gulosus&quot;)
* &quot;Crappie&quot;, including
** White crappie (&quot;Pomoxis annularis&quot;)
** Black crappie (&quot;Pomoxis nigromaculatus&quot;)
* &quot;Centrarchus&quot;
** Flier (&quot;Centrarchus macropterus&quot;)

The term panfish may also be used for members of &quot;Percidae&quot; families, such as:

* &quot;Perch&quot;, including
** European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;)
** Yellow perch (&quot;Perca flavescens&quot;)
** Balkhash perch (&quot;Perca schrenkii&quot;)
* &quot;Gymnocephalus&quot;
** Ruffe (&quot;Gymnocephalus cernua&quot;)

The term panfish may also be used for members of other families, such as:

* &quot;Creek chub&quot; (&quot;Semotilus sp.&quot;)
* &quot;Cutlips minnow&quot; (&quot;Exoglossum maxillingua&quot;)
* &quot;European bullhead&quot; (&quot;Cottus gobio&quot;)
* &quot;Dark sleeper&quot; (&quot;Odontobutis obscura&quot;)
* &quot;Three-lips&quot; (&quot;Opsariichthys uncirostris&quot;)

<text>USCGC &quot;Ingham&quot; (WPG/WAGC/WHEC-35) is one of only two preserved s. Originally Samuel D. Ingham, she was the fourth cutter to be named for Treasury Secretary Samuel D. Ingham. She was the most decorated vessel in the Coast Guard fleet and was the only cutter to ever be awarded two Presidential Unit Citations.

==History 1934–1988==
&quot;Ingham&quot; was built at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. The Treasury Department awarded her contract on 30 January 1934. Her keel was laid on 1 May 1935, and she was launched on 3 June 1936, along with her sisters , and the . &quot;Ingham&quot; was christened by Ms. Katherine Ingham Brush on that date and the new cutter was formally commissioned on 12 September 1936.
&quot;Ingham&quot; served with distinction during World War II on convoy duty. Protecting ships ferrying vital supplies to Britain, &quot;Ingham&quot; battled stormy weather, German U-boats, and enemy aircraft. On 15 December 1942, during one crossing, &quot;Ingham&quot; engaged and sank the enemy submarine &quot;U-626&quot;. After 1944, &quot;Ingham&quot; served as an amphibious flagship and she would later take part in three campaigns in the Pacific Theater. &quot;Ingham&quot; was the last active warship in the US fleet with a U-Boat kill.

===Convoys escorted===
===Post-war service===

In August 1966, &quot;Ingham&quot; rescued lone sailor William Willis off the US eastern seabord, landing him at the Argentia Coast Guard station.


&quot;Ingham&quot; earned two Presidential Unit Citations for her service in Operation SEA LORDS and Operation SWIFT RAIDER during the Vietnam War on a deployment from 3 August 1968 to 28 February 1969.

On completion of her deployment to Vietnam, &quot;Ingham&quot; returned to regular Coast Guard duties, serving until 1988, when she was decommissioned. At that time, &quot;Ingham&quot; was the second oldest commissioned U.S. warship afloat, second only to in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Museum Ship and Memorial==

Acquired by Patriot&#x27;s Point (located near Charleston, South Carolina) in 1989, &quot;Ingham&quot; was displayed along with the aircraft carrier , the destroyer , and the submarine until 20 August 2009.

On 20 August 2009 &quot;Ingham&quot; was towed to the Coast Guard piers in North Charleston, South Carolina for minor repairs and to await dry docking. She underwent a short dry docking period at Detyen&#x27;s Shipyard in North Charleston and was then towed to Key West, Florida arriving there on 24 November 2009. She is now a member of Key West Maritime Memorial Museum.

The Commandant of the Coast Guard has declared &quot;Ingham&quot; the National Memorial to Coast Guardsmen Killed in Action in World War II and Vietnam. These 912 casualties are identified on a memorial plaque on Ingham&#x27;s quarterdeck.
&quot;Ingham&quot; was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1992.

<doc id="956859" wikidata="Q2249560" url="?curid=956859" title="Mini 4WD">
<text>is a powered toy car generally 1:32 in scale equipped with 4WD. The cars are used for racing, built to run on a U-shaped track.

==History==
The Mini 4WD originated in Japan in 1982, when toy manufacturer Tamiya introduced Mini 4WD race cars. A Mini 4WD race car is a 1:32 scale kit featuring four-wheel drive powered by an electric motor using a pair of AA batteries. A single electric motor turns both axles. These kits snap and screw together without the need for glue.

By the late 1980s, the Mini 4WD hobby was well-established in Japan, and it began taking off in the United States as well. In February 1989, several American and Japanese companies unveiled their versions at the annual toy fair in New York. In late 1989, an average Japanese boy owned eight to 11 Mini 4WD cars. By November 1989, Hasbro introduced their Record Breakers: World of Speed series of cars, imported from Japan. Mattel, Matchbox, and others were also expected to release their own versions.

By the 2000s, many other companies had ventured into the Mini 4WD market, including Tokyo Marui, Kyosho, Academy, Aoshima Bunka Kyozai, Matchbox, Revell, Hot Wheels, Tonka, Hasbro, Auldey and Bandai.

On June 23, 2019, the Tamiya Mini 4WD Asia Challenge was held at the Glorietta shopping mall in Makati, Philippines. Over 200 participants (including 87 foreigners) attended the event. To commemorate the event, Tamiya released a 1:32 scale mini 4WD car of the distinctive Jeepney named &quot;Dyipne&quot;.

=== World records ===
According to the Guinness World Records, the world record for Longest Mini 4WD Track was created on
November 3, 2019 at 3,191.58 meters at Amagi Dome in Izu, Shizuoka, Japan. It took a Mini 4WD car 12 minutes to circle the entire track.

==Design==
A standard Mini 4WD vehicle is made of plastic using a Body-on-frame design. The chassis contains the primary components including the AA batteries, motor, gearing, propeller shaft, drive axles, and wheels. The body is purely decorative although some newer designs incorporate ducting to cool the motor. The body and chassis are made from hard plastics like ABS.

Side rollers along the front, center, or rear of the vehicle are used to guide the vehicle around a U-shaped track.

==Upgrading==
Because of the modular design, nearly all the components can be swapped and change the performance of the vehicle. This allows the owner to customize the performance of the vehicle to the particular track.

Higher specification motors can be used to replace the standard FA-130 type motor. There are three specifications that characterize all motors: RPM, torque, and power-consumption. RPM is the speed the motor provides, and the torque its strength. A higher RPM means higher maximum speed, higher torque gives more acceleration and allows the car to better withstand the difficulties of climbing slopes or running through turns.

Gears can also be replaced with sets with different ratios. Common ratios include (3.5:1), (3.7:1), (4:1), (4.2:1), (5:1), and &quot;Special&quot; (ratio varies but is usually 6.4:1). The higher the ratio, the better the acceleration rate and torque; the lower the ratio, the better the maximum speed.

In a standard car, the left and right wheels are on a fixed axle. Special one-way wheels can be added to allow the left and right wheels to rotate at different speeds acting as a differential, to allow for improved cornering performance.

In addition, upgrade parts such as bumper width extensions, stabilizers, and brakes can be added that aid in the car&#x27;s performance through corners, banked turns, elevation changes, and jumps.

==Street Mini 4WD==
The &quot;Street Mini 4WD&quot; (Japanese: &quot;ストリートミニ四駆&quot;) is a racing sport activity that combines modeling with physical running. The athlete, in this sport, runs and drives a Mini 4WD. The model car is driven using &quot;a guide stick&quot;.

The athletes then run alongside their models, controlling them and making them turn left or right using the guide stick.

Born in Italy in 1994 and affiliate CSEN (italian National Educational Sports Center) from 2023, Street Mini 4WD is a sport practiced in various countries around the world.

The Street Mini 4WD is a physical activity that involves running, coordination of movements and proprioception.

Street Mini 4WD athletes have the opportunity to learn technical basic concepts about how model cars work.

Although the Mini 4WD cars were produced in Japan, the street races have obtain a lot of interest in Italy where racers runs for many years in this kind of competitions as well as in the usual on-track ones.

The street racing in Italy employ a regulation based on the official Tamiya race regulation, but there aren&#x27;t restricted to only Tamiya models and Grade-Up Parts. (For example, the use of battery from the other brands is allowed.)

<text>The Tenggerese people are a sub-ethnic group of Javanese in eastern Java who are centered in the isolated Tengger mountains (Mount Bromo) in the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park in eastern Java. The majority of the Tenggerese population profess Java Hinduism as their religion. They are the only Javanese ethnic group who have remained Hindu since the Majapahit era after the Osing people, who have been Islamized.

Scattered communities of Tenggerese also exist in the Pasuruan, Probolinggo, Malang, and Lumajang regencies of eastern Java. They are traditionally believed to be the descendants of the legendary Roro Anteng and Joko Seger. The Tenggerese are considered an ethnic sub-group of the Javanese people.

==History==
Before the 15th century, the Tenggerese people was closely linked with the Majapahit and other kingdoms. According to legend, Jaka Seger and Roro Anteng are the ancestors of the Tenggerese.

==Language==
The Tenggerese speak an archaic Javanese (Majapahit) dialect called Tengger Javanese. Elements of modern Javanese influences can be heard in their speech. They have their own written Kawi script based on the old Javanese Brahmi type.

==Religion==
Majority of Tenggerese population profess Java Hinduism as their religion, although they have incorporated Buddhist and Animist elements. Like the Balinese, they worship Ida Sang Hyang Widi Wasa (roughly &quot;Big Almighty Lord&quot;) for blessings in addition to other Hindu and Buddhist deities that include the Tri Murti (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu) and Buddha. Their places of worship include the Punden, Poten and Danyang. The Poten is a sacred area of ground at Mount Bromo&#x27;s sand sea and becomes the focus of the annual Kasada Ceremony. In the Poten, it contains several buildings and enclosures, arranged in a specific composition called the Mandalas (zones).

The Tenggerese also worship a host of spirits (ancestor worship). They include &quot;cikal bakal&quot;, the spirits of the founders of the village, the &quot;roh bahurekso&quot;, the village guardian spirits and the &quot;roh leluhur&quot;, the spirits of the ancestors. Rituals to propitiate these spirits are conducted by special priests. During these rites small doll-like figures representing the spirits are clothed in batik cloth and are presented with food and drink. It is believed that the spirits partake of the essence of these offerings. The Bromo volcano is considered one of the most sacred places. If it erupts, they believe that their god is very angry.

The Tenggerese give food offerings to the gods.
* &quot;Sajenan&quot; is presented to the guardian deities by the priest in formal liturgy. For different occasions foods are offered as Sajenan. For instance, during weddings a cone of rice, &quot;Tumpeng Walagara&quot;, is offered. It is considered to be a source of blessing for the couple and the whole village. 
* &quot;Suguhan&quot; are offered by ordinary Tengger Hindus to their ancestral spirits.
* &quot;Tamping&quot; are food offerings to evil spirits to ward off bad luck and typically consist of meat, rice and bananas wrapped up in leaves and put at places such as cemeteries, bridges, and road intersections.

The priests are called &quot;Dukun&quot; or &quot;Resi Pujangga&quot;; they play a middle role in their religious worship. They are believed to possess spiritual knowledge of the gods and the spirits called Ilmu, which they carefully guard from ordinary Tenggers. Priesthood is hereditary and generally passes down from father to son. Each village has only one of these priests, with three assistants — &quot;Legen&quot;, &quot;Sepuh&quot;, and &quot;Dandan&quot;.

In the past few decades, due to overpopulation in Madura, many Madurese settlers exploited the Tenggerese land by clearing some of their nature reserves and converting 2-3% (up to 10,000) of the Tenggerese to Islam in the process — particularly those in the more accessible areas in the lowlands just outside the Tengger range. Because of this Islamic missionary activity, the remaining Hindu Tenggerese asked the Balinese Hindus for help by reforming their culture and religion closer to the Balinese. The Indonesian government declared the Tengger mountains as the Bromo-Tengger-Semeru national park and declared that any more logging in this area is an illegal act, therefore protecting the Tenggerese from further disruption.

==Lifestyle==
The Tenggerese are basically either agriculturalists or nomadic herders. The agriculturalists generally live on the lower altitudes, while the nomads live on the higher altitudes, riding on small horses.

==Festivals==
===Yadnya Kasada===

The main festival of the Tenggerese is the &quot;Yadnya Kasada&quot;, which lasts about a month. On the 14th day of the &quot;Kasada&quot;, the Tenggerese go to Poten Bromo and ask for blessing from the main deity Hyang Widi Wasa and Mahadeva, the God of the Mountain (Mount Semeru), by offerings rice, fruit, vegetables, flowers, livestock and other local produce. They also see the examination of the medicine men memorizing prayers. The medicine man who passes the exam is chosen to be the spiritual leader of the Tengger tribe.

The origin of this festival is a legend that dates back to the Majapahit kingdom, during the reign of King Brawijaya; the queen of the kingdom gave birth to a daughter named Roro Anteng, who married Jaka Seger, a young man from the Brahmin caste.

According to the legend, Roro Anteng and Jaka Seger were among many others who fled from the tattering Majapahit kingdom during the 15th century, when the declining kingdom was in the brink of collapse while the rapid spread of Islam in Java has begun. The couple and their followers later settled in the Tengger mountains and ruled the region jointly under the title Purbawisesa Mangkurat Ing Tengger. Tradition holds belief that they are ancestors of modern Tengger people.

For a few years the Tenggerese people flourished under the leadership of Jaka Seger and Roro Anteng, yet the king and queen were unhappy for they had no children. Desperate, they climbed to the top of Mount Bromo and prayed for help. Deeply moved by the couple&#x27;s depth faith, the god of Mount Bromo assured them of offspring but with the condition that the youngest child be sacrificed in the crater of the volcano. After giving birth to 25 children, the time came for Roro Anteng to fulfill her part of the pledge. Though reluctant, they were threatened with catastrophe, forcing them to fulfill their pledge and comply with the god&#x27;s wishes. They had no choice but to sacrifice their 25th child, Kesuma, by throwing him into the crater. In an alternate story, Kesuma was taken and consumed by the fire arising from the crater when he was about to flee from Mount Bromo. The Tengger people then started to commemorate this festival.

<doc id="956872" wikidata="Q443621" url="?curid=956872" title="Viola Liuzzo">
<text>Viola Fauver Liuzzo (née Gregg; April 11, 1925 – March 25, 1965) was an American civil rights activist in Detroit, Michigan. She was known for going to Alabama in March 1965 to support the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights. On March 25, 1965, she was shot dead by three Ku Klux Klan members while driving activists between the cities and transportation. 

Also in the pursuit car was an undercover informant working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). His role in this and other events was not revealed until 1978. To deflect attention from the FBI, its head J. Edgar Hoover made defamatory claims about Liuzzo. 

Three of the men were charged with murder by the state, but not convicted. (The informant Gary T. Rowe was not charged.) The federal government charged the three KKK members with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction era civil rights statute. On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, a landmark in Southern legal history. They were sentenced to ten years in prison. 

As the FBI informant testified in court, he was put in the witness protection program for his safety. He lived until 1998. 

In 1983, after learning about the FBI&#x27;s activities related to the Liuzzo case, her family filed a lawsuit against the FBI for not preventing her death and for damages because of false accusations. The court dismissed the lawsuit. 

Viola Liuzzo was given many honors posthumously; her name was inscribed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. Her grandson set up a scholarship in her honor.

==Early life and education==
Viola Fauver Gregg was born on April 11, 1925, in the small town of California, Pennsylvania, the elder daughter of Eva Wilson, a teacher, and Heber Ernest Gregg, a coal miner and World War I veteran. Her father had taught himself to read as a child and left school in the eighth grade. Her mother had a teaching certificate from Southwestern Pennsylvania Normal School (later California University of Pennsylvania and currently Pennsylvania Western University, California). The couple had a second daughter, Rose Mary, in 1930. 

Heber lost his right hand in a mine explosion when they were living in Georgia. It was during the Great Depression, and the Greggs became solely dependent on Eva&#x27;s income. She had difficulty finding anything other than short-term teaching positions. Struggling with poverty, when Viola was six the family decided to move from Georgia to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Eva found a teaching position.

The family was very poor and lived in one-room shacks with no running water. The schools Liuzzo attended did not have adequate supplies, and teachers had little time to deal with the many children in need. Because the family moved so often, Liuzzo usually began and ended the year in different schools. Having been poor in Tennessee for much of her childhood and adolescence, she was close to the racially segregated nature of the South. This would have a powerful influence on her activism.

==Michigan==
In 1941, the Gregg family moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan, where her father sought work to assemble bombs at the Ford Motor Co. Viola dropped out of high school after a year and eloped at the age of 16. Her marriage did not last, and she returned to her family. 

Two years later, the Gregg family moved to Detroit, Michigan, which was segregated by race. Tensions between whites and blacks were very high as they competed for jobs and housing in a city with many new residents, including immigrants. In the early 1940s there was violence and rioting between ethnic groups. Viola Gregg witnessed some of these, which influenced her later civil rights work.

==Marriage and family==
In 1943, she married George Argyris, the manager of a restaurant where she worked. They had two children, Penny and Evangeline Mary. They divorced in 1949. 

Two years later, Gregg married Anthony Liuzzo, a Teamsters union business agent. They had three children together: Tommy, Anthony Jr., and Sally. They also raised her first two daughters. 

Liuzzo wanted to gain more education and trained to become a medical laboratory assistant at the Carnegie Institute in Detroit, Michigan. In 1962 she enrolled part-time at Wayne State University to continue her education.

In 1964, she began attending the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Detroit and joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

A large part of Liuzzo&#x27;s activism, particularly with the NAACP, developed from her close friendship with Sarah Evans, an African-American woman. They had met at a grocery store where Liuzzo worked as a cashier, and kept in touch. Liuzzo hired Evans to help with her child care. After taking on more, she promoted Evans to her fulltime nanny and housekeeper. The two women had both grown up in the South, and found they had similar views on some issues, including support for the civil rights movement. After Liuzzo&#x27;s death, Evans became the permanent caretaker of her friend&#x27;s five young children.

==Local activism==
Liuzzo protested against Detroit&#x27;s laws that allowed students to drop out of school more easily. Instead, she wanted families to be helped to get their children educated. She temporarily withdrew her own children from public school to express her opposition to the law. Because she publicly home-schooled them for two months, Liuzzo was arrested. She pleaded guilty in court and was placed on probation.

==Selma, Alabama==

In the early 1960s, activism increased in the South, especially for voting rights. In February 1965, a night demonstration for voting rights at the Marion, Alabama, courthouse turned violent. State troopers clubbed marchers; they beat and fatally shot Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old African-American man. His death spurred the fight for civil rights in nearby Selma, the larger county seat of Dallas County. 

Organizers had asked for help from Rev. Martin Luther King, who had been active in efforts to desegregate Birmingham, Alabama. He led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), whose members planned a protest march for Sunday, March 7, 1965. Gov. George Wallace banned the march, but activists ignored his ban. 

Six hundred unarmed marchers headed for the Edmund Pettus Bridge to cross the Alabama River and go to the state capital were clubbed and whipped by state trooper, fracturing bones and gashing heads. Seventeen people were hospitalized on the day later called &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;.

Like many observers, Liuzzo was horrified by the images broadcast and published by national media. A second march took place March 9. Troopers, police, and marchers confronted each other at the county end of the bridge, but when the troopers stepped aside to let them pass, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the marchers back to Brown Church, which was the base. 

That night, a white group beat and murdered civil rights activist James Reeb, a Unitarian Universalist minister from Boston, who had come to Selma for the second march. Many other clergy and sympathizers from across the country had also gathered for the second march.

On March 16, Liuzzo took part in a protest at Wayne State. She decided to do more. She called her husband to tell him she would be traveling to Selma to respond to Rev. King&#x27;s call for people of all faiths to come, saying that the struggle &quot;was everybody&#x27;s fight.&quot; Leaving her children in the care of family and friends, she drove to Selma. 

There she contacted the SCLC and was put to work delivering aid, welcoming and recruiting volunteers, and transporting volunteers and marchers to and from airports, bus terminals, and train stations. She volunteered the use of her car, a 1963 Oldsmobile.

On March 21, 1965, more than 3,000 people began the third march. They were blacks, whites, working-class people, doctors, nurses, priests, nuns, rabbis, homemakers, students, actors, and farmers. Many notable civil rights leaders participated, including Martin Luther King Jr., and his wife Coretta Scott King, Ralph Abernathy, Ralph Bunche, and Andrew Young. It took five days for the protesters to reach their goal of Montgomery, the state capital. Along the way, other protesters joined and by the last day, some 25,000 marchers entered Montgomery. The event received widespread media coverage.

Liuzzo marched the first full day and returned to Selma for the night. On Wednesday, March 24, she rejoined the march four miles from the end. A celebration took place that night with national entertainers. Liuzzo helped at the first aid station. On Thursday, Liuzzo and other marchers reached the state capitol building, which still flew a Confederate flag together with the state one. Rev. King Jr. addressed the crowd of 25,000, calling the march a &quot;shining moment in American history.&quot;

==Murder==
After the march, Liuzzo, assisted by Leroy Moton, a 19-year-old African American, continued shuttling marchers and volunteers from Montgomery back to Selma in her car. James Orange, an SCLC veteran, warned her that it was very dangerous and she should not drive to Montgomery. 

As Liuzzo and Moton were driving along Route 80 to Selma, a car tried to force them off the road. After dropping passengers off, she and Moton headed back to Montgomery. While getting gas at a local filling station, they were subject to abusive, racist comments by other customers. 

Liuzzo was stopped at a red light when a car with four white men pulled up alongside. When they saw the white woman and black man together, they followed Liuzzo as she tried to outrun them. They overtook the Oldsmobile and shot directly at Liuzzo, mortally wounding her twice in the head. The car veered into a ditch, crashing into a fence. The men were found to be members of the local Ku Klux Klan, including Gary Thomas Rowe, an FBI informant.

The bullets missed Moton, but he was covered with Liuzzo&#x27;s blood. He lay motionless as the Klansmen checked their victims. After they left, Moton sought help. He flagged down a truck driven by Rev. Leon Riley, who had also been shuttling civil rights workers to Selma.

==Funeral==
Liuzzo&#x27;s funeral was held on March 30 at Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in Detroit. Many prominent members of the civil rights movement, unions, and state government came to pay their respects. Among them were Martin Luther King Jr., NAACP executive director Roy Wilkins, Congress on Racial Equality national leader James Farmer, Michigan lieutenant governor William G. Milliken, Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, and United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther.

Less than two weeks after her death, a charred cross was found in front of four Detroit homes, including the Liuzzo residence. The Ku Klux Klan had been active in Detroit in the early 20th century, but had declined after scandals in the early 1920s. This was one of their signs for intimidation.

==Arrest and legal proceedings==
The four Klan members in the car—Collie Wilkins (21), FBI informant Gary Rowe (34), William Eaton (41), and Eugene Thomas (43)—were quickly arrested. President Lyndon Johnson announced the arrests within 24 hours on national television. He focused on the positive work of FBI agents&#x27; solving Liuzzo&#x27;s murder. The government wanted to divert scrutiny from the fact that one of the men, Gary Thomas Rowe Jr., was an FBI informant.
Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were indicted on April 22 in the State of Alabama for Liuzzo&#x27;s death. FBI informant Rowe served as a witness. Rowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots on the order of Thomas.

The Department of Justice charged the three defendants with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction civil rights statute. The charges did not specifically refer to Liuzzo&#x27;s murder. On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.

Wilkins and Thomas were free on bail while appealing their cases. They were each arrested and convicted of firearms violations, and sentenced to jail for those crimes. During this period, the January 15, 1966, edition of &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; published an ad offering Liuzzo&#x27;s bullet-ridden car for sale. Asking $3,500, the ad read, &quot;Do you need a crowd-getter? I have a 1963 Oldsmobile two-door in which Mrs. Viola Liuzzo was killed. Bullet holes and everything intact. Ideal to bring in crowds.&quot;

After all three defendants were convicted of the federal charges, state murder cases proceeded against Eaton and Thomas. Eaton, who had not previously been jailed, died of a heart attack on March 10. 

The jury acquitted Thomas of the state murder charge after 90 minutes of deliberations.

On April 27, 1967, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the federal convictions of the surviving defendants. Thomas served six years in prison for the crime. 

Due to threats from the Klan, both before and after his testimony, Gary Thomas Rowe went into the federal witness protection program. He died in 1998 in Savannah, Georgia, after having lived several decades under several assumed identities.

==FBI&#x27;s cover-up and leaks==
Within 24 hours of Liuzzo&#x27;s assassination by the Ku Klux Klan and the FBI&#x27;s informant Gary Thomas Rowe, J. Edgar Hoover launched a smear campaign against Liuzzo. He leaked false information to the press, subordinate FBI agents, and select politicians, claiming that there were &quot;puncture marks in her arm indicating recent use of a hypodermic needle; she was sitting very, very close to that negro in the car; that it has the appearance of a necking party.&quot;

While attempting to hide the fact that an FBI informant was in the attack car, the FBI wanted to ensure that the agency was not held responsible for permitting its informant to participate in violent acts, without FBI surveillance or backup. Rowe had been an informant for the FBI since 1960. The FBI was aware that Rowe had participated in violent acts with KKK members. These included an attack on the Freedom Riders in 1961, and having a role in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham in September 1963. 

Prior to the shooting, Rowe had called his FBI contact to tell him that he and other Klansman were traveling to Montgomery, and that violence was planned. During the investigation, the FBI did not test Rowe’s gun or the bullet casings for his fingerprints. 

The results of autopsy testing, which was conducted in 1965, revealed that Liuzzo&#x27;s system did not contain any traces of drugs. It also showed that she had not recently had sex at the time of her death. 

It was not until 1978 that the FBI&#x27;s role in the smear campaign was uncovered, when Liuzzo&#x27;s children obtained case documents from the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act.

==Legislation and subsequent lawsuits==

Liuzzo was condemned at the time by different racist organizations for having brought her death upon herself. Her decision to be part of such a dangerous undertaking was seen by some as controversial for a married mother of five.

Rowe was indicted in 1978 and tried for his involvement in the murder. The first trial ended in a hung jury, and the second trial ended in his acquittal.

The Liuzzo family sued the FBI for the death of Liuzzo and associated damages. On May 27, 1983, Judge Charles Wycliffe Joiner rejected the claims, saying there was &quot;no evidence the FBI was in any type of joint venture with Rowe or conspiracy against Mrs. Liuzzo. Rowe&#x27;s presence in the car was the principal reason why the crime was solved so quickly.&quot; Liuzzo family lawyer Dean A. Robb said, &quot;This is a terrible opinion. I&#x27;m shocked. I think this is incredible.&quot; 

In August 1983, the FBI was awarded $79,873 in court costs. These costs were later reduced to $3,645 after the ACLU appealed on behalf of the family.

==Legacy==
The Walter P. Reuther Library of Wayne State University contains original archival material related to Liuzzo and her case. The &#x27;Viola Liuzzo Papers&#x27; contain documentation of the events of the murder, the resulting investigation, and the later legal actions taken by the Liuzzo Family. 

The papers also contain FBI murder investigation files and completed Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for the release of documents that documented the FBI&#x27;s involvement with the Ku Klux Klan. Several documents are also related to the FBI, informants, and the Freedom Riders.

==Representation in other media ==
Liuzzo was featured in part 3 of a TV series, &quot;Free at Last: Civil Rights Heroes&quot;.

Her murder was shown in episode 2 of the &quot;King&quot; miniseries.

In 2004, Liuzzo was the subject of a documentary, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;.

Episode 3 of the sixth season of the CBS crime drama &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&#x27;s Women&quot;, was loosely based on Liuzzo&#x27;s story.

In 2008, Liuzzo was memorialized in a song, &quot;Color Blind Angel&quot;, by the late blues singer Robin Rogers on her album &quot;Treat Me Right&quot;.

Laura Nessler wrote the play &quot;Outside Agitators&quot; (2014), based on Liuzzo. It premiered at the Prop Theater in Chicago, Illinois, on September 20, 2014.

Liuzzo was played by Tara Ochs in the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot;.

==Honors==
Viola Liuzzo Park is located at Winthrop and Trojan in Detroit.

Liuzzo&#x27;s name is inscribed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, created by Maya Lin.
In 2011, the Viola Liuzzo Ethics Scholarship was started at Adrian College by her grandson, Joshua James Liuzzo.

In 2015, Wayne State University bestowed its first posthumous honorary doctorate degree to Liuzzo.

In 2019, a statue which honors Liuzzo was unveiled in Detroit.

In 2021, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson ordered the re-issue of the 1965 Winter/Water Wonderland license plates, in homage to Liuzzo; one was on her car when she drove from Detroit to Alabama. Secretary Benson said she had started her career in Montgomery, Alabama, and was moved by Liuzzo&#x27;s advocacy to try to gain the vote for all people.

<text>A Night at Red Rocks with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra is a live album by The Moody Blues, recorded from a live performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre on 9 September 1992. This performance was the first time The Moody Blues performed in concert backed by a full orchestra. The concert was held in celebration of the 25th anniversary of their second album, &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot;, which had featured the London Festival Orchestra. The full video of this concert was broadcast as a fundraising broadcast for PBS in the United States.

The original album was released on 9 March 1993 by Polydor Records, and a Concert Home Video was released shortly after. On 4 March 2003, a deluxe two-disc edition was released, which features the entire concert.

Also, in November 1999, a second video of the concert titled The Other Side of Red Rocks was released. It contained footage of the songs not on the first video release, as well as interviews and rehearsal footage.

<doc id="956878" wikidata="Q2528150" url="?curid=956878" title="A Question of Balance">
<text>A Question of Balance is the sixth album by the Moody Blues, released in 1970. The album reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and No. 3 in the United States.

==Background==
The album was an attempt by the group to strip down their previously lush, psychedelic sound in order to be better able to perform the songs in concert. Guitarist Justin Hayward remembers, &quot;From the beginning of our recording sessions we were all convinced that we had to record an album of songs that could easily translate into effective live performances. In a way, we almost reverted to performing live in the studio, without venturing too much into the world of overdubs.&quot; He continues, &quot;It was quite refreshing, actually, doing the &quot;A Question of Balance&quot; album...getting back to that place where we could just get a bunch of songs together with a bit less instrumentation going on, that we could just sit around in a room and play.&quot;

Still, the album does convey a theme of asking questions and finding meaning in the world. Explains Hayward, &quot;On the first side, we were asking ourselves the question, and on the second side, we are starting to answer it. Looking for the answers will keep us going for a long time.&quot; The album title takes its name from the first and last tracks on the album, &quot;Question&quot; and &quot;Balance&quot;. According to drummer Graeme Edge, &quot;We very much wanted to reflect what the title says: that maintaining yourself is a question of balance. That was the start of where we were almost treated as semi-deities. It&#x27;s very hard to maintain your equilibrium under those pressures.&quot; Mike Pinder adds, &quot;All in all, it was one of the peaking albums for me. I listen to it now, and I can see why people are still discovering it. We never wanted to be a sock-it-to-me band. We all wanted to just express ourselves. The whole idea of individual growth and being able to transfer that into our music. Much of &quot;A Question of Balance&quot; did exactly that.&quot;

==Writing==
Apart from the desire to record songs with simpler arrangements, Mike Pinder remembers the album being more influenced by domestic life as well as global concerns: &quot;We were all getting married and having kids. That was really the difference. We&#x27;d settled down. These are not songs that we made up out of thin air. These are all songs that we lived. They were all songs about how we can be better, the kinds of things we can leave behind and move forward. The planet earth has its problems, and people live in the left side of their brain. And the right side of the brain is where creativity takes place. Ingenuity, ideas, concepts — all those things come through on the right side of the brain. I&#x27;ve always looked at it that way, from a spiritual point of view, as opposed to a religious point of view. There&#x27;s a vast, vast difference. And so the emotions were really all about love and peace and everything, but also about intelligence and about consciousness. Trying to wake people up from bad habits. Bad habits in my book are something that hurt other people, innocent people.&quot;

Hayward reflects on this songwriting process at the time: &quot;A song is a song. There are specific Moody Blues songs that start in that quiet way. I&#x27;ve had so many small parts of songs that I&#x27;ve just enjoyed playing, and it takes me a while to realize: &#x27;This is a song. If I just work at it a bit more, I&#x27;ve got a whole song here.&#x27; Inspiration has to find you working, and not just toying around. So it&#x27;s a question of prompting myself to actually use some of the bits I&#x27;ve been enjoying on the guitar and make a song out of them.&quot;

&quot;Question&quot;, the lead track on the album, was written by Hayward as a protest song about war. The group were influenced by their experiences interacting with Americans on their concert tours, and the fear and anger about the draft during the Vietnam war. He explains, &quot;I&#x27;d written &quot;Question&quot; on the morning of the recording session. It was recorded in just a few takes. I was very aware of the anti-war movement in America which had grown thanks to the Vietnam war. It was a protest song about the state of the world, which I feel is still very relevant today.&quot; He continues, &quot;I got very angry one night listening to the news about the war in Vietnam. The only reason to have a war to me is to do with starvation...people fighting for their lives. But just for a bit of territory, a bit of land somewhere, was stupid. In my own naive way, I put a lot of those feelings into Question.&quot; He elaborates on the song&#x27;s sentiment: 

&quot;Question&quot; was arranged shortly before the recording session. Hayward had been struggling to finalize two different songs that happened to be in the same key, and decided to present the two songs as a single work. He remembers, &quot;That was a song written under pressure. There was a Moody session set at Decca studios on a Saturday. At midnight that Friday I still didn&#x27;t have anything for the session the next day. I had parts of two songs that were in the same key but were vastly different. About four o&#x27;clock in the morning I thought, &#x27;Oh shit, all I can do is try to put them together and make them work, somehow.&#x27; I took it into the studio the next morning and I played it to the guys and they said, &#x27;That&#x27;s great!&#x27; They never even thought about it being two songs. There is a lot of social commentary in that song. I was reflecting what was happening in the college circuit that we were playing at the time.&quot;

The lyrics to Mike Pinder&#x27;s &quot;How Is It (We Are Here)&quot; poke fun at the concept of Fort Knox. Pinder points out the irony of damaging the environment to dig up precious metals and refine them only to place them right back into the ground again at depositories.

Ray Thomas&#x27; &quot;And the Tide Rushes In&quot; is a reflection on the impermanence of material things. It was inspired by conflict with his ex-wife. He explains, &quot;And the Tide Rushes In&quot; was recorded after a big argument with my ex-wife. And I say...&#x27;You keep looking for someone to tell your troubles to, I&#x27;ll sit down and lend an ear yet I hear nothing new.&#x27; Just complaining, then the tide rushes in and washes my castle away.&quot; He remembers producer Tony Clarke making light of the fact the situation was productive creatively: &quot;I remember Tony Clarke saying to her that she ought to have more rows with me because he considered it such a great song.&quot;

Drummer Edge contributes &quot;Don&#x27;t You Feel Small&quot;: &quot;It started basically as a bit of a go about ecology, and then I saw in it a lot of things the way people seem to be allowing themselves to be made to feel very insignificant by establishment things.&quot; The song is sung by the band&#x27;s four singers, though Edge made an attempt at singing the song during the sessions.

&quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;, written by bassist John Lodge, takes direct inspiration from the fable by Aesop. He sees the song as a metaphor for the band: &quot;It was really a sort of analogy, really, of the Moody Blues. You know, everyone else was racing away. We were just trying to say, &#x27;If we just keep on going [with] exactly what we really believe, we&#x27;re going to last and [beat out] everyone&#x27;.&quot;

Hayward&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You&quot; was inspired by one of his relationships; he wrote the song on his newly acquired cherry red Gibson. Mike Pinder interprets a broader meaning from the song, one of taking responsibility on an individual level for global problems. He explains, &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s Up to You&#x27; is very much a starker reality that people still need to realize, that it&#x27;s up to the individual to make anything better, whether it be a political vote or in conserving water or in not polluting the planet.&quot;

Pinder&#x27;s &quot;Melancholy Man&quot; takes a global perspective and lament&#x27;s society&#x27;s ability to address its broadest challenges: &quot;The melancholy part of it is the melancholy for the human race and for the planet is what it&#x27;s about. What was that line? &#x27;I might not make it there with you&#x27; the famous line of Martin Luther King. Martin Luther was very much on my mind.&quot; He continues, &quot;The single most incorrect interpretation of &quot;Melancholy Man&quot; has been that maybe it was a song about &quot;me&quot; being melancholy. I used that as a way of saying that there are different levels of melancholy, and that this was a melancholy for the whole world because of the impending breakdown of the structure in all things that we have seen happen since the song came out. What we&#x27;re seeing now is just more results of what was being done then and what continues to be done by the industrial giants and governments of the world, and the greedy little cigar-smoking guys like on the album cover.&quot;

The final track, &quot;The Balance,&quot; centers around a spoken narration. The accompanying music was originally arranged for Lodge&#x27;s song, &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;, which was later reworked.

==Recording==
The album was recorded between January and June 1970 at both Wessex Sound Studios and the band&#x27;s familiar Studio One at Decca studios in West Hempstead. Tony Clarke once again served as producer alongside engineer Derek Varnals. Sessions between 17 and 31 January yielded the backing tracks for &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You&quot;, &quot;Tortoise and the Hare&quot;, &quot;And the Tide Rushes In&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Feel Small&quot; and &quot;Question&quot;. &quot;Minstrel&#x27;s Song&quot; was recorded 10 March. Sessions from 1 to 6 June produced &quot;Dawning is the Day&quot;, &quot;Melancholy Man&quot;, &quot;How Is It We Are Here&quot; and &quot;The Balance&quot;.

The sessions were a departure from their studio practice on the previous album, &quot;To Our Children&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Children&quot;, featuring minimal overdubs and an simpler, more natural sound that the band could more readily replicate on stage. Hayward remembers, &quot;With &quot;Question&quot;, the song, recorded before the album, there&#x27;s no double-tracking, just echo and a big old 12-string guitar. We learned to play that the old-fashioned way and just recorded it one Saturday. It was a deliberate attempt to try and pull back to something more real.&quot;

Despite the simpler production overall, the album does feature some unique studio techniques. Some of Hayward&#x27;s guitar work on &quot;Dawning is the Day&quot; was recorded at half-speed to create a mandolin-like effect. Hayward credits the expertise of Varnals and Clarke in capturing his desired guitar sound throughout the album: &quot;Oh, they were really superb. Derek Varnals — I have to credit him with my guitar sound in the early days. On those early records, I played acoustic and electric. He captured all of that just beautifully. I&#x27;d put the acoustic lines down first, and then we&#x27;d do the electric stuff, maybe with the other guys playing at the same time. There&#x27;s a song called &quot;It&#x27;s Up to You&quot; where he suddenly nailed it down.&quot;

Hayward and Pinder&#x27;s guitar work on &quot;Melancholy Man&quot; reminded producer Clarke of the type of music that would appear on a French film soundtrack, and he leaned into that feeling during the song&#x27;s production, limiting the use of echo on the track. Appropriately, the song subsequently became a number one hit in France, and received heavy airplay in the era surrounding the death of Charles DeGaulle.

==Album cover==
The album cover is a vertical gate-fold created by Phil Travers. The bottom of the image features a beach scene with beach-goers enjoying the sun while a menacing storm cloud approaches. Travers explains the meaning of the imagery: &quot;The people on the sleeve are actually just sitting there, on holiday, basking in the sunshine with presumably not a care in the world. They just don&#x27;t notice what&#x27;s coming up at them and probably won&#x27;t until it&#x27;s too late. It&#x27;s just a symbolic way of putting over what most of us do - we bury our heads until it&#x27;s too late.&quot;

Travers originally included a small painting of John Blashford-Snell in the cover collage. The image was of Snell wearing a pith helmet, holding a pistol and pointing it at an elephant. After the album was released, Snell sued Decca Records and the band over the image, saying it was &quot;a source of constant embarrassment over being on the cover.&quot; Travers, with the direction of Decca, changed the image of Snell to that of a man without a pith helmet holding the pistol.

The collage of pictures of the band in the center of the album&#x27;s gate-fold was produced by projecting several images onto a single screen. According to Clarke, this method was a creative solution when it was discovered that the preferred method of printing a collage of several individual pictures would have added several weeks of production time.

==Release==
In March 2006, the album was remastered into SACD format and repackaged with six extra tracks. In 2008, a remaster for standard audio CD was issued with the same bonus tracks.

==Promotion==
The band promoted the album through tours of the United States and the United Kingdom. The group appeared at both the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music and the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. The Isle of Wight set was released in 2008 as &quot;Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970&quot;.

After being discovered in North America by Island CEO Lyon Cohen when she contributed to the &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; soundtrack, he was very interested in signing Utada to his record label and she eventually accepted the offer. She traveled to Los Angeles to sign the contract and began recording the studio album straight after her signing. However, during the time frame from 2002 to 2003, Utada was diagnosed with a benign ovarian tumour that needed surgery and treatment. She also married her then-husband Kazuaki Kiriya, which stopped recording temporarily.

Musically, &quot;Exodus&quot; incorporates several musical genres including dance music and electronic music, whilst also incorporating several elements from electronica, avant-garde, alternative and glitch music. &quot;Exodus&quot; is her first studio album to have full English-language tracks since her album &quot;Precious&quot; under the alias &quot;Cubic U&quot;. The majority of the tracks on the album were written, composed and produced by Utada herself but also received help from American rapper Timbaland, Danja and Utada&#x27;s father Teruzane Utada. Lyrically, the album deals with several human-related stories from a third-person perspective. Themes incorporated inside the album are love, prostitution, lust, her own mixed heritage, and break-ups.

Upon its release, &quot;Exodus&quot; received positive reviews from most contemporary music critics. Many critics complimented the composition experimentation and Utada&#x27;s vocal deliveries on certain tracks. However, critics were divided towards the lyrical content and felt the production and album was only trying to attract a wider audience through the Western market. &quot;Exodus&quot; was a commercial success in Japan, peaking at number one and sold over one million units in the country, making it Utada&#x27;s highest-selling English studio album there. It was certified one million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). In North America, &quot;Exodus&quot; peaked at number 160 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Four singles were released from the album. The first single &quot;Easy Breezy&quot; failed to gain success in both Eastern and Western territories, but the following single &quot;Devil Inside&quot; peaked at number one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs, making it her highest charting effort regarding any &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The final North American single &quot;Exodus &#x27;04&quot; charted moderately in America overall, while the lead UK single &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot; failed to achieve higher success in that region as well. To promote the album, Utada had commenced her &quot;Utada Hikaru In Budokan 2004&quot; tour.

==Background==
Utada, who was under her birth name Hikaru Utada in the Japanese market, is one of the most successful musicians inside of Japan. Utada had previously released three Japanese-language studio albums; &quot;First Love&quot;, &quot;Distance&quot; and &quot;Deep River&quot;. All three studio albums achieved massive success inside of Japan, all listed as one of the biggest selling albums in Japan with the debut release being the most successful Japanese album of all time, selling seven million units in Japan and an additional three million worldwide. Several singles from each album sold over one million units and tallied up to seven of her singles having sold over one million units, with her debut single &quot;Automatic/Time Will Tell&quot; selling over two million.

In 2001, Utada was approached by American label Island Def Jam to record a track titled &quot;Blow My Whistle&quot; with American rapper Foxy Brown for the American film &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. The track was written by Utada herself, alongside Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo. The song is included on Def Jam&#x27;s &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; soundtrack, which peaked at the 11th spot on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, also hitting number 1 on the Top Soundtracks chart. &quot;Blow My Whistle&quot; was produced by the Neptunes.

Then, in 2003, Island CEO Lyon Cohen was interested in signing Utada to his label and she eventually accepted his recommendation and signed her first deal in 2004. Utada had flown to Los Angeles to meet Cohen and Universal Music Group CEO Doug Morris with her mother Keiko Fuji and father Teruzane Utada to support them there. Her record label Toshiba-EMI had also released her material worldwide like Island, but Cohen commented that Island would support her choices throughout the American audience. According to Steve McClure from &quot;Billboard&quot;, Utada and her father were originally approached by EMI Music and Virgin Records beforehand and were also interested in signing Utada to their label. A source from the article commented; &quot;People at [Virgin] were kissing up to her dad and promising him that they were definitely going to launch her internationally.&quot; However, he later commented &quot;But with the complete meltdown [...] Everybody the Utadas knew is gone,&quot; noting the discontinuity in the label&#x27;s support for them.

==Composition==
===Music and style===
Musically, &quot;Exodus&quot; is a dance-oriented album that incorporates several electronic genres. The album was co-produced by Utada herself. Utada made the majority of the album alone, saying she &#x27;locked herself away&#x27;. During an interview in the United States while promoting &quot;This Is the One&quot; in 2009, when asked about &quot;Exodus&quot;, Utada said that &quot;Exodus&quot; was &quot;a very experimental album. I was like a mad scientist working away in an underground laboratory&quot;, going on to say &quot;I had the time of my life but it was a very intense, introverted process&quot;. In the review by AllMusic, they commented on the music, stating &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;delivers a diverse collection of urbane, modern, and, at times, almost avant-garde electronica and dance music [...] A true fusion of Western and Eastern music&#x27;s edgier elements thrown together in an after-hours disco melting pot.&quot;

The majority of the album deals with dance music and traditional J-pop. &quot;Devil Inside&quot; incorporates several electronic dance genres including progressive house and dark pop. The song features drum machines and synthesizers and Rob Carolan from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; compared it to Super Mario games during their intro sequences. Carolan had originally labelled the album&#x27;s musical composition as &quot;strange&quot; and exemplified &quot;Hotel Lobby&quot; as an example for incorporating J-pop. &quot;The Workout&quot; was compared to Gwen Stefani&#x27;s 2005 track &quot;Hollaback Girl&quot; for its instrumentation of colossal drums and horn parts but was often criticized for being &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;demented.&quot; The Timbaland co-written single &quot;Exodus 04&quot; takes homage towards the album title and was compared to the composition by American rapper and singer Aaliyah, with instrumentation of string samples and piano, while &quot;Let Me Give You My Love&quot; incorporates more fast forward &quot;future funk music&quot; that was also compared to Aaliyah.

&quot;Exodus&quot; was noted by several critics for its experimentation of genres. &quot;Kremlin Dusk&quot; features a dark &quot;bizarre neo-industrial symphony&quot; that also references American poet Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Raven&quot; with the lyric (&quot;In the words of Mr. Edgar Allan Poe/Now I&#x27;m sober and nevermore/Will the Raven come to bother me at home.&quot;) &quot;Animato&quot; includes several electronic instrumentation&#x27;s including synthesizers and keyboards to create an &quot;alien-like&quot; sound and composition. Throughout the track, &quot;it synthesized mournful choirs and oppressive alien electronics, pushes pop to its most avant garde extremes.&quot;

===Lyrical content===
Like the rest of her previous studio albums, Utada had written the entire album by herself. In a press conference of her record label signing, Utada stated that she had written all the songs, including Japanese tracks, in English; &quot;Most of my lyrics come out in English, which I then rewrite in Japanese [...] so this project will save a little bit of time in songwriting, which I&#x27;ll be needing, to give the best of both [Hikaru Utada] and [Utada Hikaru.]&quot;

The introduction track and interlude titled &quot;Opening&quot; and &quot;Crossover Interlude&quot; incorporate the same lyrics in different composition. The tracks feature the lyric (&quot;I don&#x27;t wanna cross over between this genre, that genre,&quot;) which talks about the different composition of each track and also incorporates her interpretation of Western crossover to J-pop. On her single &quot;Easy Breezy&quot;, the song talks about a past relationship with a man. In the lyrics, she mocks her Asian-American heritage that was often noted as &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;silly&quot; which they specify; (&quot;You&#x27;re easy breezy / And I&#x27;m Japaneezy&quot;).

In the song &quot;Animato&quot;, the track references several music genres including dance, hip-hop and pop; it also comments about a woman having an extra-marital affair.

==Release and promotion==
After Utada signed to the record label in 2002, Cohen and Morris had high hopes in releasing &quot;Exodus&quot; during the end of 2002 or early 2003 in North America, with a release date already being confirmed. However, after Utada had promoted her third Japanese studio album &quot;Deep River&quot;, she underwent surgery after being diagnosed with a benign ovarian tumor, causing Utada to put her promotional activities on hold and the release of &quot;Exodus&quot; to be delayed. She was still persistent in a 2002 release, but Utada had announced her marriage to director Kazuaki Kiriya and then delayed the studio album release.

Then, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced the release of &quot;Exodus&quot; in Spring 2004. Utada told &quot;Billboard&quot; about Asian artists like herself making it into the Western market; &quot;Maybe the fruit has always been ripe, but so far, Asian artists who reached for it were a few inches short.&quot; The album was released on September 8, 2004, by Island Records in Japan, and worldwide on October 5, 2004. The album was re-released by Mercury Records in the UK over a year later on September 25, 2005. This is Utada&#x27;s debut English language studio album (not including &quot;Precious&quot;). &quot;Exodus&quot; was released in North America nearly a month after its release in Japan, on October 5, 2004, two months later in Brazil, on November 17, 2004, and the UK version was released about a year after on September 26, 2005. &quot;Exodus&quot; was re-released on September 20, 2006, in Japan, under Universal International, parent company of Island Def Jam.

On February 23, 2005, Utada did a one-night-only showcase at the Skylight Studios, New York. There she sang a few songs from &quot;Exodus&quot;, including &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot; and &quot;Kremlin Dusk&quot;.

In an interview, Elton John stated that:

==Critical reception==
&quot;Exodus&quot; received generally favorable reviews from most music critics. AllMusic gave three out of five stars, highlighting the two first tracks from the album and &quot;Exodus 04&quot;, stating that &quot;Exodus&quot; &quot;Delivers a diverse collection of urbane, modern, and, at times, almost avant-garde electronica and dance music&quot;, and concluding with &quot;&quot;Exodus&quot; heralds the American arrival of an unusual and challenging artist.&quot; Rob Carolan from &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; gave it a positive review, stating &quot;So there you have it. It&#x27;s not a pop masterpiece but it&#x27;s a decidedly good record. Few J-Pop artists ever attempt to make such a bold and risky record, but with Exodus, Utada has established herself as an individual who can proudly stand aside from the rest of the identikit J-Pop idols. Hopefully she&#x27;ll keep on getting better, but even if she falls into the machine, she will always have Exodus, and that&#x27;s enough.&quot; Isaac McCalla from Dancemusic on About.com gave it a positive review, complimenting the album&#x27;s process, calling some songs &quot;radio-friendly&quot; and then the rest more &quot;chilled-out&quot;. He later concluded saying &quot;[...] Utada is definitely an up and comer; she&#x27;s beautiful, writes good songs with intelligent lyrics, and has a keen electronic sensibility.&quot;

Elysa Gardner from &quot;USA Today&quot; gave it three stars out of four. She said &quot;Utada Hikaru crafts slick, electronically fueled tracks that could, on their surface, pass as background music for nightclubs and loft parties. Luckily, this young singer/songwriter is more than a ghost in her own machine.&quot; She compared Utada to an early stage of Madonna saying she is &quot;girlish yearning that transcends her vocal limitations and melts the cool sheen of her arrangements.&quot; &quot;JPop-Go&quot; gave the album a positive review saying &quot;This is Utada&#x27;s &#x27;Exodus&#x27; from overly-polished, commercial pop; her two fingers up at the music industry. Existing fans with more eclectic tastes will be pleasantly surprised, while hardcore J-pop junkies might be disappointed at the changes.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Exodus&quot; is the largest debut selling foreign language album in Japanese history (debut with 523,761 units). It is the 247th best selling album of all time in Japan. On September 8, 2004, Universal Music Japan shipped 1 million copies of the album, breaking a record that was previously held by Mariah Carey (she had sold 500,000). However, the album did not achieve a lot of success in the US, reaching number 160 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and has sold in excess of 55,000 units in the territory according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album did however have success on the US Top Heatseekers albums chart, peaking at number five, making Utada&#x27;s first album to debut on both charts.

==Singles==
&quot;Easy Breezy&quot; was released as the first single of the album. This is the first single to debut her name &quot;Utada&quot; which she uses for her English releases. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, however the song did not chart on any singles chart. The song however sold more than 2000 copies in Japan. The second single of the album, &quot;Devil Inside&quot;, was released on September 14, 2004, and received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The song was released physically in the United States. No music video was produced. The song remained Utada&#x27;s biggest hit in the United States, as it peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Play chart.

The third single &quot;Exodus &#x27;04&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, and was released in 2005, a late release on the album. No music video was produced for the single. The song received little attention yet again, but did peak at number twenty-four on the Hot Dance Club Play. The fourth and last single, &quot;You Make Me Want to Be a Man&quot;, was released as the only UK single. The song received little success as well, but peaked at number 227 on the UK Singles Chart.

Sinestro was created by John Broome and Gil Kane, and first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #7 (August 1961). According to Kane, his appearance was modeled after British actor David Niven.

In 2009, IGN ranked Sinestro as the 15th-greatest comic book villain of all time.

==Fictional character biography==

===Green Lantern===
Sinestro is born on the planet Korugar in space sector 1417. His dedication to preserving order originally manifests in his previous career, an anthropologist specializing in the reconstruction of ancient Korugan civilizations. One day, Green Lantern Prohl Gosgotha crash-lands near him, injured and apparently dying. Prohl gives his ring to Sinestro, who barely understands what to do with it before coming under attack from the Lantern&#x27;s pursuer: a Weaponer of Qward. In the end, Sinestro has to destroy the ruins he was restoring to crush the Qwardian. Afterwards, Gosgotha turns out to still be alive and asks for his ring back so he can summon help. Addicted to the ring&#x27;s immense power, Sinestro lets him die and convinces the Guardians that the ring chose him as Gosgotha&#x27;s successor.

In &quot;Green Lantern (2005)&quot; #45, his wife is shown for the first time in a flashback and revealed to be the sister of Abin Sur.

When Hal Jordan joins the Green Lantern Corps, Sinestro, now a seasoned and respected Lantern, is assigned to be his instructor. Jordan is horrified at his new mentor&#x27;s totalitarian methods, though Sinestro maintains that he is only doing what he considers necessary to protect Korugar. During his training, Jordan helps Sinestro repel an attempted invasion by the alien warlords known as the Khunds. When Jordan disobeys orders and contacts the Lanterns for help, Sinestro&#x27;s dictatorship is exposed, and he is forced to appear before the Guardians for punishment. Katma Tui, the leader of a Korugarian resistance movement who feels that Sinestro&#x27;s &quot;protection&quot; keeps her people from growing as a society through contact with other alien races, is recruited as his replacement in the Corps. Katma Tui eventually grows into one of the most respected Green Lanterns, but she and the rest of Korugar initially resists her appointment to the Corps. Due to Sinestro&#x27;s actions, Korugar has come to consider the symbol of the Green Lantern Corps an emblem of terror and oppression.

===Punishment and villainy===

For using the power of the Green Lantern to instill fear rather than combat it, the Guardians banish Sinestro to the antimatter universe, a counterpart to the &quot;real&quot; universe made up of &quot;negative matter&quot;. Sinestro ends up on the antimatter world of Qward, that universe&#x27;s counterpart of the Guardians&#x27; homeworld Oa, which is ruled by the Weaponers of Qward, a race of warriors and scientists that bear a fierce hatred of the Guardians and all Green Lanterns. By exiling Sinestro to a world ruled by evil beings who specifically hate Green Lanterns, the Guardians hope to humble him. However, Sinestro is quick to seize the opportunity, persuading the Weaponers that he can use his knowledge of the Corps to destroy them for good.

Creating a yellow power ring for Sinestro to use, the Weaponers send him back to the &quot;positive matter&quot; universe to seek revenge. Sinestro quickly becomes the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; most powerful nemesis, partially due to a weakness in their power rings that prevent them from directly affecting the color yellow. Despite this, skilled Green Lanterns like Jordan, Sinestro&#x27;s most hated enemy, always find ways to defeat him.

===Pre-Crisis===
Sinestro first meets Hal after already making an alliance with Qward; the latter had already beaten the Weaponers three times. Sinestro takes him to Qward and is able to imprison him in a yellow bubble by threatening to kill 100,000 innocent people. Hal uses his ring to create the illusion that it is nearly out of power. After releasing Hal from the bubble to eliminate him, Sinestro is defeated and imprisoned in a specially constructed cell by Hal, who does not take him back to his universe as it would go against the jurisdiction of the Guardians. By gradually sapping the cell&#x27;s power, Sinestro escapes and continues to menace Hal. He tries to attack the Guardians after kidnapping Hal and assuming his identity to occupy a meeting of Green Lanterns and absorb power from their rings by casting an illusion of an attacking monster. However, Jordan escapes and defeats Sinestro, who is placed in a new prison empowered by the rings of hundreds of Lanterns, so he cannot drain it. However, Sinestro anticipates this and uses a backup yellow ring hidden in his boot to escape.

===Post-Crisis===
Before the Guardians take a leave of absence from their universe to attempt mating with their female counterparts, the Zamarons, they construct an inescapable prison for Sinestro and thousands of others on Oa. Sinestro manages to free himself through the mental manipulation of the Mad God of Sector 3600. Wielding nearly unlimited power, Sinestro murders entire star systems until he is finally subdued by the Green Lantern Corps of Earth. Guilty of multiple acts of genocide, Sinestro is put on trial again by the assembled membership of the Green Lantern Corps. Finding him guilty, they condemn him to death and execute him. Sinestro manages to cheat death by sending his essence into the Central Power Battery and shutting it down. While in the Battery, he also makes a startling discovery about the ancient weakness to yellow within the Green Lanterns&#x27; light.

Hal Jordan enters the Battery in a desperate attempt to restore the powers of his fellow Lanterns and ultimately defeats Sinestro, whose spirit is condemned to remain trapped inside the Central Battery, powerless, for eternity. Yet Sinestro earns an even greater personal victory as the so-called &quot;yellow impurity&quot; turns out to be a sentient entity known as Parallax, the living embodiment of fear. He also discovers the battery&#x27;s power source is Parallax&#x27;s counterpart, Ion, the embodiment of willpower. Thanks to Sinestro&#x27;s actions, Parallax infects Jordan&#x27;s mind, leaving him vulnerable to fear and setting up Sinestro&#x27;s ultimate triumph.

===Guy Gardner===
Sinestro&#x27;s original yellow ring is stolen by Guy Gardner from Oa&#x27;s crypt. During the encounter, Sinestro possesses John Stewart to confront Guy, but his spirit is not strong enough to defeat Gardner&#x27;s willpower.

As the yellow ring only &quot;speaks&quot; Sinestro&#x27;s native language, Guy was unable to communicate with it, which seems to understand him to a degree.

Guy only wears the yellow ring for a short time before Hal Jordan, possessed by Parallax, destroys it.

===Parallax===

In the meantime, the return of the Guardians results in the Corps being re-established. The newly restored Corps is short-lived, thanks to the inadvertent efforts of the alien warlord Mongul and Hank Henshaw, a cyborg who is at the time impersonating Superman. As part of their ultimately thwarted plot to transform Earth into a new version of Mongul&#x27;s interstellar fortress Warworld and gain revenge on Superman, Mongul and the Cyborg use several nuclear devices to destroy Coast City, California, which is Hal Jordan&#x27;s home, and everyone living in it. Driven mad with grief by the destruction of his city and the Guardians&#x27; apathy towards his plight, Jordan&#x27;s previously indomitable willpower is shattered. Parallax is thus able to possess him completely and push him towards a homicidal rampage that wipes out most of the Guardians and leaves scores of Green Lanterns dead or maimed, as Parallax seeks to absorb the Central Power Battery&#x27;s energies into his being.

As a last-ditch effort to halt Jordan&#x27;s rampage, the Guardians free Sinestro from the Central Power Battery and send him to stop Jordan. After a battle, Jordan snaps Sinestro&#x27;s neck, apparently killing him. It is later revealed that what the Guardians actually extracted from the Battery was a hard-light construct of Sinestro, created by Parallax and mentally puppeteered by the real Sinestro from within the Battery. Parallax then bonds to Jordan, who takes the entity&#x27;s name for himself, and promptly finishes off the Green Lantern Corps by absorbing the Central Battery&#x27;s energies into himself. With the Battery destroyed, Sinestro escapes and goes into hiding as he watches Jordan become what he always hated Sinestro for being: a traitor and a murderer reviled by his friends and his allies. Despite this, the last surviving Guardian, Ganthet, gives the last remaining power ring to Kyle Rayner, foiling Sinestro&#x27;s revenge against the Guardians and the Green Lantern Corps.

===Duplicate and time travel===
During the period when he is believed to be dead, Sinestro has two indirect encounters with other heroes. Wonder Woman faces a duplicate of Sinestro created by an artificial intelligence based on the dead son of its creator. The A.I. created the duplicate Sinestro after watching videos of his old battles, believing that he is just playing a computer game, and unaware of the real-world damage that he is causing. Although he lacks Sinestro&#x27;s tactical genius, the unrestrained use of his power destroys a bridge and a building, nearly suffocating Wonder Woman before he is defeated by the hero Champion (really a disguised Hercules).

On another occasion, Kyle Rayner is accidentally sent approximately a decade into the past, where he witnesses a battle between Hal and Sinestro. Although he initially distracts Hal at a crucial moment, Kyle&#x27;s ring&#x27;s immunity to yellow proves vital in preventing Sinestro from executing the Guardians of the Universe. Kyle and Hal subsequently sabotage his attempt to crash a planetoid into Oa by switching rings. Hal allows Sinestro to throw him away before using Kyle&#x27;s ring to destroy the villain&#x27;s equipment. Kyle keeps Sinestro occupied, using Hal&#x27;s ring to protect him from mortal injury. However, after Sinestro&#x27;s actions result in Hal unintentionally traveling to Kyle&#x27;s future, this encounter is apparently erased from history when Hal, Kyle, and a Parallax-possessed older Hal Jordan (who detected his younger self&#x27;s displacement and intervenes to try and send him home) work together to send Hal and Parallax back to their proper place in time to ensure that a Hal Jordan is present with powers to defeat the Sun-Eater, Hal returning to his own time just before Kyle&#x27;s arrival changes history and defeating Sinestro on his own.

Later, Hal Jordan&#x27;s Spectre also clashes with the ghost of Sinestro, who traps him in a dream where he never becomes a Green Lantern. Upon his defeat, Sinestro is given the chance to choose his fate. He chooses Hell, and is dragged into the Underworld. In retrospect, it is assumed that this version of Sinestro is another hard light construct created by Parallax at Sinestro&#x27;s behest, as the fear entity is still bonded to Jordan&#x27;s soul during his time as the Spectre, continuously breaking his will.

===Return===
Sinestro eventually reveals the charade of his &#x27;death&#x27; when Kyle Rayner discovers the existence of Parallax and reveals it to Green Arrow and the Justice League. Nearly killing the two heroes, Sinestro is stopped by the newly resurrected Hal Jordan, who reclaims his ring and is purged of Parallax&#x27;s influence. The two fight to a draw, with Sinestro escaping to the antimatter universe when his ring is damaged by Hal.

Sinestro later appears in the mini-series &quot;Villains United&quot;, in which he captures Lady Quark for the Secret Society of Super Villains, a group of which Sinestro previously was a member. Here, he plays a major role in the Society&#x27;s massacre of the Freedom Fighters, who are investigating the meeting place of other villains, but walk into an ambush. Sinestro begins the fight by blowing a hole through the chest of the second Black Condor, killing him instantly. He then defeats Uncle Sam, leaving him for dead.

===Sinestro Corps===

After the Battle of Metropolis, Sinestro retreats to the antimatter universe, allies with the Anti-Monitor, and embraces the doctrine of spreading fear. The Green Lantern Corps is once again reformed with the return of Hal Jordan so Sinestro decides to found the Sinestro Corps, offering yellow power rings to the most feared and savage warriors of the universe. He is also revealed to have masterminded the death of Kyle Rayner&#x27;s mother by having Despotellis infect her as part of a plot to break Kyle&#x27;s will and make him Parallax&#x27;s latest host.

The Sinestro Corps War begins with an attack on Oa. Sinestro returns to Korugar to confront his successor, Soranik Natu. Sinestro defeats her, but makes it appear she has defeated him. This will force her to stay on Korugar to fulfill her responsibilities as &quot;the Savior of Korugar&quot;.

Sinestro returns to Qward and joins the battle occurring there. He confronts Earth&#x27;s Green Lanterns, and upon their escape, follows them toward Earth, the Sinestro Corps&#x27; real target. The Sinestro Corps begin attacking Earth. Sinestro reveals to Hal, Guy and John that he intends to turn Earth into the new homeworld for the Sinestro Corps and the site of the new Coast City into a mass graveyard, &quot;A mecca of fear&quot;. During the battle, the Guardians enacted new laws to the Book of Oa. The first new law was to give the Green Lanterns the ability to use lethal force. Sinestro claims he has achieved his overall goal because now the Green Lanterns spread fear by being unchecked. Hal Jordan and Kyle Rayner beat Sinestro in hand-to-hand combat. Sinestro is then imprisoned in Oa&#x27;s Sciencells where he learns from Hal Jordan that he has received a death penalty. Despite his personal defeat, Sinestro claims victory. Sinestro&#x27;s overall goal through his war was to groom his former Corps for a more active, forceful role in the universe. With the enactment of the Corps&#x27; new laws and the approval of lethal force, the Green Lantern corps will inspire fear, creating the same effect as the Sinestro Corps: order through fear.

With the hunt for the members of the Sinestro Corps becoming one of the Green Lantern Corps&#x27; highest priorities, many of those who wield yellow power rings have been incarcerated in Oa&#x27;s Sciencells, with their power rings stored in the large chamber that houses the entire detention facility. Sinestro has been shown to have chewed a large hole in his finger, and he used his blood to paint the insignia of the Sinestro Corps on his cell window. All Sinestro Corps members followed his example, with the result of thousands of emblems across the cosmic jail. When Sinestro formed his insignia from blood, the power rings stationed on Oa seemed to react violently, threatening to break free of their confines.

===Rage of the Red Lanterns===
Sinestro is to be executed on his homeworld of Korugar. During the transport, a group of Sinestro Corps members attempt to free him. Atrocitus and his Red Lanterns intervene by attacking both Corps and kidnapping Sinestro. In the midst of the battle, Saint Walker tells Hal Jordan that Sinestro&#x27;s survival is crucial to stopping the Blackest Night. After being taken to Ysmault, he is nailed to a cross to await his execution at the hands of Atrocitus, who wishes to make Sinestro suffer by taking revenge on everything he cares for. His targets include Korugar and Sinestro&#x27;s hidden daughter. Sinestro escapes and goes back to his home world to see to family business.

===War of Light===
After escaping the assault by the Red Lanterns, Sinestro finally reaches his homeworld of Korugar. After rapidly incapacitating Princess Iolande, he confronts Soranik Natu and reveals that she is his daughter. He informs Soranik that his wife took her as a child and left him as he began his rise to power on Korugar. He was eventually able to locate his daughter and give her the mark on her face, his family&#x27;s coat of arms, along with a micro-transmitter so he could locate her. He visited Soranik throughout her life using his ring to alter his appearance. He even took a picture of her and the Natus at her medical school graduation. Sinestro then says that he is proud of his daughter for succeeding where he could not, namely bringing order to Korugar as a member of the Green Lantern Corps. He then tells her that they must work together to stop the Blackest Night. After leaving Korugar, Sinestro visits Abin Sur&#x27;s grave and plans to attack the Star Sapphires&#x27; homeworld Zamaron.

===Blackest Night===

When he arrives, he first encounters Carol Ferris. While Sinestro holds no ill will towards Carol and only wishes to free his Corpswomen from Zamaron, he warns Carol that he will hurt her if she stands in his way. Carol then encases Sinestro in a crystal structure, forcing him to relive the death of his love, Arin Sur (Abin Sur&#x27;s sister). Angered by this, Sinestro bursts free, staggering Carol enough for his Corpsmen to seize her. However, before he can capitalize on the advantage, the Black Lanterns invade, led by Amon Sur, shocking both Sinestro and Carol. Hal Jordan and Indigo-1 then appear, initially fighting off some of the Black Lanterns. Indigo-1 teleports the group to Korugar so that Sinestro can confront Mongul. Sinestro defeats Mongul by overriding his rings, then imprisons him within the Yellow Central Battery. Sinestro vows to keep Mongul alive (and torture him), then kill him when the Blackest Night is over. He also proclaims himself to be &quot;leading this coalition&quot; against the Black Lanterns. The Sinestro Corps&#x27; celebration is cut short when a ship crash lands nearby, containing Black Lanterns Abin and Arin Sur.

As the Black Lanterns attack, Arin emotionally manipulates Sinestro before Hal, Abin and Carol rescue him. With all four in place, they destroy Abin&#x27;s and Arin&#x27;s rings. Afterward, Hal and Sinestro debate whether to contact the Blue or Red Lanterns, respectively. Hal then makes the decision himself. Sinestro relents, tells his Corps that there is a temporary truce with the GLC, and travels with the others to Odym. After gathering the other Corps leaders, Sinestro and the others follow the Black Lantern battery to Earth, where Nekron has already risen. Under Indigo-1&#x27;s direction, they combine their lights, thinking it will destroy the Black Lanterns&#x27; source of power, but this fails and in an attempt to bolster their ranks, Ganthet duplicates the Corps leaders&#x27; rings, having them seek out candidates to deputize. Sinestro&#x27;s ring chooses the Scarecrow. The Black Lantern Spectre then attacks the group. To defeat it, Hal releases Parallax from its prison, intending to let it possess him again. Sinestro offers to join with Parallax instead, but is rebuffed. When the restored Spectre manages to separate Parallax from Hal, Sinestro again tries to claim the fear entity as his own, but is foiled after an unknown force pulls Parallax away.

During the battle, Nekron kills a Guardian and uses its blood to summon the Entity, the embodiment of the universe&#x27;s life force, from within Earth. Outraged at the Guardians&#x27; need for control, Sinestro stabs Ganthet with his ring. Hal Jordan realizes the Entity needs a mind to guide it and prepares to fly in, but Sinestro does so himself, taking the Entity&#x27;s power.

Later, Sinestro is apparently killed by Nekron, but revived by the White Entity, claiming to be in harmony with every living being in the universe and thus reborn as the true Guardian of the Universe. However, Sinestro is unable to fully control the Entity&#x27;s power, and Nekron is able to separate them. Hal then comes to the realization that, even though Nekron allowed the various resurrections of the heroes he transformed into Black Lanterns, it was they who chose to live again. This enables Hal to access the Entity&#x27;s power and transform himself and the other heroes into White Lanterns, resurrecting Black Hand and breaking Nekron&#x27;s tether to the living universe. As the various corps part ways, Sinestro notes that Larfleeze himself has changed, as he returns Lex Luthor to the other gathered Corps rather than keeping Luthor for himself after he was forced to briefly share his power with him.

===War of the Green Lanterns===
In the &quot;Brightest Day&quot; crossover, Sinestro discovers a white power battery in a crater on Earth. In the first issue of the &quot;New Guardians&quot; story arc, Sinestro reveals that the white power battery wants Hal Jordan. He and the other Corps leaders must pursue Krona, who is trying to capture all of the emotional entities. Sinestro must also work with Kyle Rayner and the Green Lantern Corps in an effort to rescue Soranik Natu from a Qwardian who made Sinestro&#x27;s original yellow ring.

In the &quot;War of the Green Lanterns&quot; storyline, Lyssa Drak traps Sinestro and the other &#x27;New Guardians&#x27; in the Book of the Black while trying to recover the emotional entities from Krona. Hal Jordan alone is able to avoid the book and escapes with the other New Guardians&#x27; rings. He later uses Sinestro&#x27;s ring when Parallax is returned to the Central Power Battery, allowing Krona to control all Green Lanterns. Hal and others escaped only thanks to their prior experience with Parallax granting them an immunity to the initial assault, to give himself a weapon against the other Lanterns. While attempting to escape the Book which forces the New Guardians to re-live their lives prior to acquiring their current rings, Sinestro discovers Indigo-1 in a prison cell, angrily proclaiming that she will escape whatever Abin Sur has planned for her, although he chooses to focus on his own escape rather than remain to question her more about this, only for Krona to burn the page that Sinestro is on before he can escape. Sinestro and the others are later freed by Kyle Rayner, who &#x27;draws&#x27; their escape. Sinestro&#x27;s ring attempts to return to him, but is overridden by Krona, who wields all seven varieties of power rings. As Hal Jordan battles Krona, Sinestro hears him as he declares his dedication to the cause of the Green Lanterns and is inspired to join his old enemy in battle. As he fights Krona, a green power ring comes to him, making Sinestro a Green Lantern once more. Sinestro is not interested in becoming a Green Lantern, but the Guardians of the Universe convince him to join the Corps. Later, when the Green Lantern Corps are in disagreement and attempt to kill him, the Corps break into the sciencells, but they discover that Sinestro was in captivity by the Guardians, who are unsuccessfully trying to remove his green ring. Later, the Green Lantern Corps were in a meeting with the Guardians and told that they should choose between discipline, continuing the fight, and starting a mutiny. The other Green Lantern Corps are in agreement.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Sinestro is angry that he has a Green Lantern power ring. The Guardians of the Universe state that the ring wishes to redeem him. With the aid of Hal Jordan, Sinestro returns to his home world of Korugar and liberates his people from the out-of-control Sinestro Corps, although his people are still afraid. Disabling his former group by rendering them comatose, he heads back out into space with the intent of shutting down the entire Sinestro Corps.

Later, he witnesses the prophecy of the Guardians&#x27; plans for a &quot;Third Army&quot; and once again retrieves Hal from Earth. However, he is captured by the Indigo Tribe and is forcibly bound to an Indigo ring. Hal convinces the Tribe that he can help Sinestro atone for his past deeds without being bound to an Indigo Ring.

The two then retrieve the Book of the Black to glean information about the future, but it inadvertently takes them to the evil Black Hand. Elsewhere, the Guardians discuss how they willed Hal&#x27;s ring to claim Sinestro to undermine all the other Corps, especially his own. Black Hand engages Sinestro and Hal in combat, whereupon the Guardians arrive and command Black Hand to kill both Green Lanterns. As their life is drained, Hal and Sinestro fuse their rings together and send off the resulting ring to get help. Soon after, Hal and Sinestro are banished to the Dead Zone.

They wander the Dead Zone searching for a way to escape and encounter the deceased Tomar-Re. He asks Sinestro and Hal to stop Volthoom, the First Lantern. When Simon Baz enters the Dead Zone during a fight with Black Hand, a way out is provided by Green Lantern B&#x27;dg. Sinestro reclaims the green ring and exits the Dead Zone with Simon.

Sinestro then teleports to his home planet of Korugar to rally support against the First Lantern. Volthoom attacks and consumes the hopes and fears of the Korugarians. With his newfound power levels, Volthoom destroys the entire planet, leaving Sinestro in the rubble.

When Kyle Rayner and Carol Ferris arrive at Korugar&#x27;s remains, Sinestro attacks, but immediately notices that Kyle is now a White Lantern. Sinestro demands that Kyle resurrects Korugar, but Kyle is unable to do so. Sinestro takes the white ring to become a White Lantern himself, but it rejects him as an unsuitable host, much to his horror. He then claims the yellow power battery instead and leaves to exact revenge, as he became a member of the Sinestro Corps again while Simon Baz fails to resurrect Korugar as well after he was rejected as an unsuitable host while wielding the white ring.

He arrives on the planet Oa and strikes Volthoom, but their battle is interrupted by the Indigo Tribe. The Tribe opens a portal to the Dead Zone, allowing Hal to escape as a Black Lantern. Volthoom engages Hal and reality begins to unravel. Sinestro turns to the Yellow Central Power Battery and releases Parallax, becoming its new host to attack Volthoom with heightened power levels. Volthoom is ultimately defeated when Hal Jordan summons Nekron.

Afterwards, Sinestro reactivates his Sinestro Corps and heads off to kill the Guardians for all the harm that they have caused. Hal attempts to talk Sinestro out of this course of action to save him from himself. However, it was too late as Sinestro reveals that he had already killed the Guardians before Hal intercepted him. Sinestro vanishes and leaves Arkillo in charge of the Sinestro Corps. Reappearing elsewhere, Sinestro secretly brings Ganthet and Sayd together, stating that he knows what it is like to lose everything, but exiles them both from Oa.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline after Batman uses a yellow ring, Sinestro appears to confront Power Ring. Sinestro follows Power Ring through the sewers, eventually severing his right arm and allowing his ring to go search for a new host. Relieved to be free, Power Ring dies, thanking Sinestro. After that, Sinestro joins Batman, Catwoman and the rest of Lex Luthor&#x27;s team into taking down the Crime Syndicate. When it comes to the final battle against the Crime Syndicate, Sinestro and Black Adam move the moon where the sun ends up weakening Ultraman. In the aftermath of the battle against the Crime Syndicate, it was stated that the villains who helped to stop the Crime Syndicate would have their criminal records wiped. Sinestro and Black Adam did not care about that; they begin laughing since they know the rules do not apply to them and went their separate ways, along with the other villains.

Sinestro then travels to a monastery on a planet. In it, he finds runes that could help him &#x27;purge&#x27; the entity from his system. After doing so, he simply meditates there, awaiting death. Then Lyssa Drak appears before him and tries to convince him to come back. He refuses, even when she says Arkillo is making a mockery of the Corps, creating thousands of rings for anyone who will swear loyalty to him. Then she reveals his people are still alive. When he asks how she knows this, she reveals she has carved every word from the Book of Parallax on her body. When Sinestro realizes that the remaining Korugarians are suffering because of his inaction, he feels fear again and his ring reactivates.

After rescuing a group of pods containing some Korugarians from the servants of the Pale Vicars, Sinestro and Lyssa Drak head to the refuge of the Sinestro Corps. Arkillo currently leads the Yellow Lanterns as the Arkillo Corps and has Soranik Natu as his captive. He and his Lanterns attack Sinestro who manages to defeat them. He forces Arkillo to yield and kills a Yellow Lantern who tries to attack him from behind as he said that Sinestro must die, melting his ring to stop it from finding a replacement. With his leadership retained, Sinestro sends Arkillo to the infirmary and Soranik argues with him, believing he had her captured. Refuting this, Sinestro shows her the Korugarians he saved and asks her to help them. Sinestro creates an elite team to personally serve him, consisting of Romat-Ru, Lyssa Drak, Rigen Kale, Dez Trivius and the most vocal Sinestro Corpsmen and has them aid himself in taking Necroplis as the new planet for the Korugarians and the moon for the Sinestro Corps. Returning to his base of operations to prepare for the move to Necropolis, Sinestro and Soranik meet with the recently awakened Korugarians who voice their distrust of Sinestro despite his intentions. Sinestro brings a Green Lantern Power Battery for Soranik to recharge and she joins his team in rescuing a group of Korugarians that are being sold into slavery on the planet Muz.

After rescuing them, they are attacked by the Paling. The Sinestro Corps defeats them and Sinestro executes them all. On their way back, Soranik reveals she left the rescued Korugarians with Hal Jordan, which angers Sinestro, who then attacks him. Sinestro&#x27;s elite team joins the fight but Sinestro calls them off say that he and Hal can have a &#x27;civilized&#x27; discussion at a safe location for the Korugarians. Hal berates Sinestro for allowing Parallax to control him and kill the Guardians, which Sinestro refuses. He proves to Hal that he is in control and summons Parallax to attack Hal, then calls it back, proving that he has mastered fear itself. Leaving Hal behind, Sinestro leaves with his team and the Korugarians, with Soranik leaving with him to look after her people.

In the aftermath of the war with the New Gods of New Genesis, Sinestro turns Warworld into the new base and headquarters of the Sinestro Corps, after the Green Lantern Corps are apparently dissolved.

===DC Rebirth===
Subsequently, in &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Warworld transports to the ruins of the planet Oa, while Sinestro (with seemingly old age) plans to control the universe. When Sinestro senses the spectrum of green light, he enters the core with Parallax. He possesses the fear entity of Parallax again and returns to his youth. He sends out his enforcers of his Corps to control the new order of the universe with fear.

When Sinestro is stunned that his Corps have reports that Hal Jordan has returned and attacks the Corps, his daughter, Soranik Natu rebels against her father, saying that he should take responsibility for his failures and that he will never learn from the Green Lantern Corps. Later, Sinestro alliances with the priests of the Sacrament, who are an enemy of the Green Lantern Corps, who reconsider him to aiding enforcement controls of the Vega system. His Corps has captured Green Lantern Guy Gardner, instead of Hal. Sinestro is furious and demands to know where Hal is, but he learns that Soranik has secured Hal safely. Sinestro then uses the imprisoned people in Warworld&#x27;s engine to increase the power of fear for his Corps, while he tries to interrogate Guy to where the Green Lantern Corps are.

Later, Sinestro feels he is in jeopardy now that the Green Lantern Corps have returned, including the fact that his daughter, Soranik, has rejected his Corps. He increases his Parallax powers to one thousand percent when Hal returns and invades Warworld. Sinestro orders his Corps to stop intervening in his personal fight against Hal and confronts his former pupil face to face. During the battle, Sinestro discovers too late that his powers have decreased due to Soranik rescuing the people that were used to power the Fear Engine. Hal then uses his energies as a living construct to incinerate the Fear Warlord and destroys Warworld, apparently sacrificing himself and killing Sinestro in the process.

Later, it is revealed that Sinestro survived from the attack, is critically injured and that he and Lyssa Drak were teleported to Qward.

The Green Lantern and Sinestro Corps now under Soranik Natu form an alliance against the encroaching Dark Multiverse. Sinestro initially plans to cooperate but is met at the Source Wall by Lex Luthor, who invites Sinestro to Earth to join his Legion of Doom. Attracted by the promise of the &quot;Invisible Emotional Spectrum&quot;, a source of power Sinestro became aware of in his youth just before joining the Green Lanterns, Sinestro abandons the Corps and travels to Earth. Reverting to his original Silver Age costume, and wielding the power of the Ultraviolet Corps rather than his Qwardian power ring, he successfully brainwashes half the planet and begins to bring the black sun Umbrax, source of the Invisible Spectrum, into the universe. After the plan is foiled, he remains an ally of Luthor.

==Powers and abilities==

Sinestro wields a yellow power ring that is functionally similar to those of the Green Lanterns, granting him flight, the ability to survive in any environment and the ability to create constructs of any shape and size. The ring must be regularly recharged with the aid of a power battery shaped like a lantern. Unlike Hal Jordan and most Green Lanterns, Sinestro wears his ring on his left hand.
As a host whose body reined in and mastered the Emotional Embodiment of Fear, Sinestro now acts as the host as well as containment vessel for the emotional entity of his Corps; Parallax gives him unprecedented power both physical and metaphysical in nature. Like previous hosts before him, Sinestro has vast reality-altering abilities, as well as a greatly amplified ring. Physically, the Master of Fear gains a dynamism boost as well, putting him on par with some of DC&#x27;s strongest characters such as Superman or most notably Black Adam, shown when both he and Adam moved Earth&#x27;s moon out of the path of its sun together, or when he was under assault by equally powerful assailants such as Superwoman, Deathstorm and Alexander Luthor who had stolen multiple powers.

Sinestro is also highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat and battle strategies, owing to his training as a former Green Lantern. He proves to be a physical match for Hal Jordan owing to these skills.

<text>Mark Abene (born February 23, 1972) is an American information security expert and entrepreneur, originally from New York City. Better known by his pseudonym Phiber Optik, he was once a member of the hacker groups Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception.

Phiber Optik was a high-profile hacker in the 1980s and early 1990s, appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, and in debates and on television. He is an important figure in the 1995 nonfiction book &quot;Masters of Deception: The Gang That Ruled Cyberspace&quot; ().

==Early life==
Abene&#x27;s first contact with computers was at around 9 years of age at a local department store, where he would often pass the time while his parents shopped. His first computer was a TRS-80 MC-10 with 4 kilobytes of RAM, a 32-column screen, no lower case, and a cassette tape recorder to load and save programs. As was customary at the time, the computer connected to a television set for use as a monitor. 

After receiving the gifts of a RAM upgrade (to 20K) and a 300 baud modem from his parents, he used his computer to access CompuServe and shortly after discovered the world of dialup BBSes via people he met on CompuServe&#x27;s &quot;CB simulator&quot;, the first nationwide online chat. On some of these BBSes, Abene discovered dialups and guest accounts to DEC minicomputers running the RSTS/E and TOPS-10 operating systems as part of the BOCES educational program in Long Island, New York. Accessing those DEC minicomputers he realized there was a programming environment that was much more powerful than that of his own home computer, and so he began taking books out of the library in order to learn the programming languages that were now available to him. This and the ability to remotely save and load back programs that would still be there the next time he logged in had a profound effect on Abene, who came to view his rather simple computer as a window into a much larger world.
==Legal tribulations==
On January 24, 1990, Abene and other MOD members had their homes searched and property seized by the U.S. Secret Service, largely based on government suspicions of having caused AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s network crash just over a week earlier on January 15 (Abene was personally accused by the Secret Service of having done as much, during the search and seizure). Some weeks later, AT&amp;T admitted that the crash was the result of a flawed software update to the switching systems on their long-distance network, thus, human error on their part. In February 1991, Abene was arrested and charged with computer tampering and computer trespass in the first degree, New York state offenses. Laws at the time were considered a “gray area” concerning information security. Abene, who was a minor at the time, pleaded &quot;not guilty&quot; to the first two offenses and ultimately accepted a plea agreement to a lesser misdemeanor charge, and was sentenced to 35 hours of community service.

Abene and four other members of the Masters of Deception were also arrested in December 1991 and indicted by a Manhattan federal grand jury on July 8, 1992, on an 11-count charge. The indictment relied heavily on evidence collected by court-approved wire tapping of telephone conversations between MOD members. According to U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier, it was the &quot;first investigative use of court-authorized wiretaps to obtain conversations and data transmissions of computer hackers&quot; in the United States.

After serving the one-year sentence at the Federal Prison Camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania, Abene was released in November 1994. In January 1995, a huge celebration called &quot;Phiberphest &#x27;95&quot; was held in his honor at Manhattan&#x27;s Irving Plaza ballroom/nightclub. In &quot;Time&quot;, Joshua Quittner called him &quot;the first underground hero of the Information Age, the Robin Hood of cyberspace.&quot; Upon leaving jail, Phiber Optik made the @Cafe his hang out spot.

==Social protests==
A statement made by U.S. Attorney Otto Obermeier in conjunction with the indication was &quot;The message that ought to be delivered with this indictment is that such conduct will not be tolerated, irrespective of the age of the particular accused or their ostensible purpose,&quot; was interpreted by Abene&#x27;s supporters to mean that MOD was made an example of, to show that the authorities could handle the perceived &quot;hacker threat&quot;. During sentencing, Judge Stanton said that &quot;the defendant stands as a symbol here today,&quot; and that &quot;hacking crimes constitute a real threat to the expanding information highway&quot;, reinforcing the view that a relatively harmless &quot;teacher&quot; was judged as a symbol for all hackers.
==Professional life==
Abene has spoken on the subject of security in many publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;. He has appeared as a speaker at both hacker and security industry conferences worldwide and frequently visits universities to speak to students about information security.

Abene made his acting début as &quot;The Inside Man&quot; in the fiction film &quot;Urchin&quot;, completed in 2006 and released in the US in February 2007, in which other hacker notables such as Dave Buchwald and Emmanuel Goldstein can be seen.

<text>Cetirizine is a second-generation antihistamine used to treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever), dermatitis, and urticaria (hives). It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin within thirty minutes and last for about a day. The degree of benefit is similar to other antihistamines such as diphenhydramine, which is a first-generation antihistamine.
Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, headache, and abdominal pain. The degree of sleepiness that occurs is generally less than with first-generation antihistamines because second-generation antihistamines are more selective for the H1 receptor. Compared to other second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine can cause drowsiness. Among second-generation antihistamines, cetirizine is more likely than fexofenadine and loratadine to cause drowsiness.

Use in pregnancy appears safe, but use during breastfeeding is not recommended. The medication works by blocking histamine H1 receptors, mostly outside the brain.

Cetirizine can be used for paediatric patients. The main side effect to be cautious about is somnolence.
It was patented in 1983 and came into medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 43rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 13million prescriptions.
== Medical uses ==

=== Allergies ===
Cetirizine&#x27;s primary indication is for hay fever and other allergies. Because the symptoms of itching and redness in these conditions are caused by histamine acting on the H1 receptor, blocking those receptors temporarily relieves those symptoms.

Cetirizine is also commonly prescribed to treat acute and (in particular cases) chronic urticaria (hives), more efficiently than any other second-generation antihistamine.

=== Available forms ===
Cetirizine is available over-the-counter in the US in the form of 5 and 10 mg tablets. A 20 mg strength is available by prescription only. It is also available as a 1 mg/mL syrup for oral administration by prescription. In the UK, up to 30 tablets of 10 mg are on the general sales list (of pharmaceuticals) and can be purchased without a prescription and pharmacist supervision. The drug can be in the form of tablets, capsules or syrup.

== Adverse effects ==
Commonly reported side effects of cetirizine include headache, dry mouth, drowsiness, and fatigue, while more serious, but rare, adverse effects reported include tachycardia and edema.

=== Pruritus after discontinuation of cetirizine ===
Discontinuing cetirizine after prolonged use (typically, use beyond six months) may result in pruritus (generalized itchiness).

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed cases of pruritus after stopping cetirizine in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database and medical literature through April 2017. Their report noted that some patients indicated the itchiness impacted their ability to work, sleep or perform normal daily activities.

No specific schedule for weaning is provided in the drug information for cetirizine.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Cetirizine acts as a highly selective antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor. The Ki values for the H1 receptor are approximately 6 nM for cetirizine, 3 nM for levocetirizine, and 100 nM for dextrocetirizine, indicating that the levorotatory enantiomer is the main active form. Cetirizine has 600-fold or greater selectivity for the H1 receptor over a wide variety of other sites, including muscarinic acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, and α-adrenergic receptors, among many others. The drug shows 20,000-fold or greater selectivity for the H1 receptor over the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and hence does not exhibit anticholinergic effects. It shows negligible inhibition of the hERG channel ( &gt; 30 μM) and no cardiotoxicity has been observed with cetirizine at doses of up to 60 mg/day, six times the normal recommended dose and the highest dose of cetirizine that has been studied in healthy subjects.

Cetirizine crosses the blood–brain barrier only slightly, and for this reason, produces minimal sedation compared to many other antihistamines. A positron emission tomography (PET) study found that brain occupancy of the H1 receptor was 12.6% for 10 mg cetirizine, 25.2% for 20 mg cetirizine, and 67.6% for 30 mg hydroxyzine. (A 10 mg dose of cetirizine equals about a 30 mg dose of hydroxyzine in terms of peripheral antihistamine effect.) PET studies with antihistamines have found that brain H1 receptor occupancy of more than 50% is associated with a high prevalence of somnolence and cognitive decline, whereas brain H1 receptor occupancy of less than 20% is considered to be non-sedative. In accordance, H1 receptor occupancy correlated well with subjective sleepiness for 30 mg hydroxyzine but there was no correlation for 10 or 20 mg cetirizine. As such, brain penetration and brain H1 receptor occupancy by cetirizine are dose-dependent, and in accordance, while cetirizine at doses of 5 to 10 mg have been reported to be non-sedating or mildly sedating, a higher dose of 20 mg has been found to induce significant drowsiness in other studies.

Cetirizine also shows anti-inflammatory properties independent of H1 receptors. The effect is exhibited through suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and by regulating the release of cytokines and chemokines, thereby regulating the recruitment of inflammatory cells. It has been shown to inhibit eosinophil chemotaxis and LTB4 release. At a dosage of 20 mg, Boone &quot;et al.&quot; found that it inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 in patients with atopic dermatitis.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Absorption ====
Cetirizine is rapidly and extensively absorbed upon oral administration in tablet or syrup form. The oral bioavailability of cetirizine is at least 70% and of levocetirizine is at least 85%. The Tmax of cetirizine is approximately 1.0 hour regardless of formulation. The pharmacokinetics of cetirizine have been found to increase linearly with dose across a range of 5 to 60 mg. Its Cmax following a single dose has been found to be 257 ng/mL for 10 mg and 580 ng/mL for 20 mg. Food has no effect on the bioavailability of cetirizine but has been found to delay the Tmax by 1.7 hours (i.e., to approximately 2.7 hours) and to decrease the Cmax by 23%. Similar findings were reported for levocetirizine, which had its Tmax delayed by 1.25 hours and its Cmax decreased by about 36% when administered with a high-fat meal. Steady-state levels of cetirizine occur within 3 days and there is no accumulation of the drug with chronic administration. Following once-daily administration of 10 mg cetirizine for ten days, the mean Cmax was 311 ng/mL.

==== Distribution ====
The mean plasma protein binding of cetirizine has been found to be 93 to 96% across a range of 25 to 1,000 ng/mL independent of concentration. Plasma protein binding of 88 to 96% has also been reported across multiple studies. The drug is bound to albumin with high affinity, while α1-acid glycoprotein and lipoproteins contribute much less to total plasma protein binding. The unbound or free fraction of levocetirizine has been reported to be 8%. The true volume of distribution of cetirizine is unknown but is estimated to be 0.3 to 0.45 L/kg. Cetirizine poorly and slowly crosses the blood–brain barrier, which is thought to be due to its chemical properties and its activity as a P-glycoprotein substrate.

==== Metabolism ====
Cetirizine is notably not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Because of this, it does not interact significantly with drugs that inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes such as theophylline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, cimetidine, or alcohol. Studies with cetirizine synthesized with radioactive carbon-14 show that 90% of excreted cetirizine is unchanged at 2 hours, 80% at 10 hours, and 70% at 24 hours, indicating limited and slow metabolism. While cetirizine does not undergo extensive metabolism or metabolism by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, it does undergo some metabolism by other means, the metabolic pathways of which include oxidation and conjugation. The precise enzymes responsible for transformation of cetirizine have not been identified.

==== Elimination ====
Cetirizine is eliminated approximately 70 to 85% in the urine and 10 to 13% in the feces. In total, about 60% of cetirizine eliminated in the urine is unchanged. It is eliminated in the urine via an active transport mechanism. The elimination half-life of cetirizine ranges from 6.5 to 10 hours in healthy adults, with a mean across studies of approximately 8.3 hours. The elimination half-life of cetirizine is increased in the elderly (to 12 hours), in hepatic impairment (to 14 hours), and in renal impairment (to 20 hours). Concentrations of cetirizine in the skin decline much slower than concentrations in the blood plasma. Its duration of action is at least 24 hours.

== Chemistry ==
Cetirizine contains - and -stereoisomers. Chemically, levocetirizine is the active -enantiomer of cetirizine. The drug is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. Analogues include cyclizine and hydroxyzine.

=== Synthesis ===

The 1-(4-chlorophenylmethyl)-piperazine is alkylated with methyl (2-chloroethoxy)-acetate in the presence of sodium carbonate and xylene solvent to produce the Sn2 substitution product in 28% yield. Saponification of the acetate ester is done by refluxing with potassium hydroxide in absolute ethanol to afford a 56% yield of the potassium salt intermediate. This is then hydrolyzed with aqueous HCl and extracted to give an 81% yield of the carboxylic acid product.

== Availability ==
Cetirizine is available without a prescription. In some countries, it is only available over-the-counter in packages containing seven or ten 10 mg doses.

Cetirizine is available as a combination medication with pseudoephedrine, a decongestant. The combination is often marketed using the same brand name as the cetirizine with a &quot;-D&quot; suffix (for example, Zyrtec-D).

Cetirizine is sold under various brand names including Alatrol, Alerid, Allacan, Allercet, Alzene, Cerchio, Cetirin, Cetizin, Cetriz, Cetzine, Cezin, Cetgel, Cirrus, Histec, Histazine, Humex, Letizen, Okacet (Cipla), Piriteze, Reactine, Razene, Rigix, Sensahist (Oethmann, South Africa), Triz, Zetop, Zirtec, Zirtek, Zodac, Zyllergy, Zynor, Zyrlek, and Zyrtec (Johnson &amp; Johnson), &quot;inter alios&quot;.

<text>Nicholas James Sebastian Rowe (born 22 November 1966) is a British actor. At the start of his career he appeared as the lead in the 1985 film &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Rowe was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, to English parents Alison, a singer, and Andrew Rowe, an editor (who subsequently became a Conservative Party Member of Parliament). He received his formal education at Eton College, where he acted in school productions, and subsequently received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Hispanic studies from the University of Bristol.

==Career==
Rowe has appeared in a variety of films, television dramas and plays. He played Sherlock Holmes in Barry Levinson&#x27;s film &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;, having read for the part while still at school. He returned to the role of Sherlock Holmes 30 years later in the 2015 film &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot;, in which he played the part in a film that the &quot;real&quot; Mr. Holmes, now a 93-year-old (played by Ian McKellen) goes to see at a theatre.

==Personal life==

<text>The Ecclesiastical History of the English People (), written by Bede in about AD 731, is a history of the Christian Churches in England, and of England generally; its main focus is on the growth of Christianity. It was composed in Latin, and is believed to have been completed in 731 when Bede was approximately 59 years old. It is considered one of the most important original references on Anglo-Saxon history, and according to some scholars has played a key role in the development of an English national identity.

==Overview==

The , or &quot;An Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, is Bede&#x27;s best-known work, completed in about 731. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background and then sketches the history of England, beginning with Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion in 55 BC. A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of St Alban, is followed by the story of Augustine&#x27;s mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons.

The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. These encountered a setback when Penda, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632. The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald and Oswy. The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury, and recounts Wilfrid&#x27;s efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex.

The fifth book brings the story up to Bede&#x27;s day, and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia, and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf, king of Northumbria. The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably, Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf&#x27;s approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede&#x27;s monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility.

==Scope==
Divided into five books (totalling about 400 pages), the &quot;Historia&quot; covers the history of England, ecclesiastical and political, from the time of Julius Caesar to the date of its completion in 731.

* Book 1 Late Roman Republic to AD 603 
* Book 2 AD 604–633 
* Book 3 AD 633–665 
* Book 4 AD 664–698 
* Book 5 AD 687–731

The first twenty-one chapters cover the time period before the mission of Augustine; compiled from earlier writers such as Orosius, Gildas, Prosper of Aquitaine, the letters of Pope Gregory I and others, with the insertion of legends and traditions.

After 596, documentary sources that Bede took pains to obtain throughout England and from Rome are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed along with critical consideration of its authenticity.

==Sources==
The monastery at Jarrow had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede&#x27;s day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning.

For the period prior to Augustine&#x27;s arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including Orosius, Eutropius, Pliny, and Solinus. He used Constantius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Germanus&quot; as a source for Germanus&#x27;s visits to Britain. Bede&#x27;s account of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is drawn largely from Gildas&#x27;s . Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as Eddius Stephanus&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;, and anonymous &quot;Lives&quot; of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert. He also drew on Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities&quot;, and the works of Cassiodorus, and there was a copy of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; in Bede&#x27;s monastery.

Bede had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great&#x27;s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine&#x27;s mission. Almost all of Bede&#x27;s information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters, which includes the &quot;Libellus responsionum&quot;, as chapter 27 of book 1 is often known. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.

The historian Walter Goffart argues that Bede based the structure of the &quot;Historia&quot; on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, dealing with the time up to the Gregorian mission of Augustine of Canterbury, Goffart asserts that Bede used Gildas&#x27;s &quot;De excidio&quot;. The second section, detailing the Gregorian mission, was framed on the anonymous &quot;Life of Gregory the Great&quot; written at Whitby. The last section, describing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart says was modelled on Stephen of Ripon&#x27;s &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;. Most of Bede&#x27;s informants for information after Augustine&#x27;s mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.

==Contents==
The &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; has a clear polemical and didactic purpose. Bede sets out not just to tell the story of the English, but to advance his views on politics and religion.
In political terms he is a partisan of his native Northumbria, amplifying its role in English history over and above that of Mercia, its great southern rival. He takes greater pains in describing events of the seventh century, when Northumbria was the dominant Anglo-Saxon power than the eighth, when it was not. The only criticism he ventures of his native Northumbria comes in writing about the death of King Ecgfrith in fighting the Picts at Nechtansmere in 685.

Bede attributes this defeat to God&#x27;s vengeance for the Northumbrian attack on the Irish in the previous year. For while Bede is loyal to Northumbria he shows an even greater attachment to the Irish and their missionaries, whom he considers to be far more effective and dedicated than their rather complacent English counterparts.

His final preoccupation is over the precise date of Easter, which he writes about at length. It is here, and only here, that he ventures some criticism of St Cuthbert and the Irish missionaries, who celebrated the event, according to Bede, at the wrong time. In the end he is pleased to note that the Irish Church was saved from error by accepting the correct date for Easter.

==Models==
Bede&#x27;s stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius, and his title is an echo of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the &quot;Acts&quot; as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.

Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done. Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms &quot;Australes&quot; and &quot;Occidentales&quot; for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses &quot;Meridiani&quot; and &quot;Occidui&quot; instead, as perhaps his informant had done. At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from Gregory of Tours&#x27; earlier &quot;History of the Franks&quot;.

Bede&#x27;s work as hagiographer, and his detailed attention to dating were both useful preparations for the task of writing the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;. His interest in computus, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.

==Themes==
One of the important themes of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; is that the conversion of Britain to Christianity had all been the work of Irish and Italian missionaries, with no efforts made by the native Britons. This theme was developed from Gildas&#x27; work, which denounced the sins of the native rulers during the invasions, with the elaboration by Bede that the invasion and settlement of Britain by the Angles and Saxons was God&#x27;s punishment for the lack of missionary effort and the refusal to accept the Roman date for celebrating Easter. Although Bede discusses the history of Christianity in Roman Britain, it is significant that he ignores the missionary work of St Patrick.

He writes approvingly of Aidan and Columba, who came from Ireland as missionaries to the Picts and Northumbrians, but disapproved of the failure of the Welsh to evangelize the invading Anglo-Saxons. Bede was a partisan of Rome, regarding Gregory the Great, rather than Augustine, as the true apostle of the English. Likewise, in his treatment of the conversion of the invaders, any native involvement is minimized, such as when discussing Chad of Mercia&#x27;s first consecration, when Bede mentions that two British bishops took part in the consecration, thus invalidating it. No information is presented on who these two bishops were or where they came from. Also important is Bede&#x27;s view of the conversion process as an upper-class phenomenon, with little discussion of any missionary efforts among the non-noble or royal population.

Another view, taken by historian D. H. Farmer, is that the theme of the work is &quot;the progression from diversity to unity&quot;. According to Farmer, Bede took this idea from Gregory the Great and illustrates it in his work by showing how Christianity brought together the native and invading races into one church. Farmer cites Bede&#x27;s intense interest in the schism over the correct date for Easter as support for this argument, and also cites the lengthy description of the Synod of Whitby, which Farmer regards as &quot;the dramatic centre-piece of the whole work.&quot; The historian Alan Thacker wrote in 1983 that Bede&#x27;s works should be seen as advocating a monastic rather than secular ministry, and Thacker argues that Bede&#x27;s treatment of St Cuthbert is meant to make Cuthbert a role-model for the role of the clergy advocated by Gregory the Great.

The historian Walter Goffart says of the &quot;Historia&quot; that many modern historians find it a &quot;tale of origins framed dynamically as the Providence-guided advance of a people from heathendom to Christianity; a cast of saints rather than rude warriors; a mastery of historical technique incomparable for its time; beauty of form and diction; and, not least, an author whose qualities of life and spirit set a model of dedicated scholarship.&quot; Goffart also feels that a major theme of the &quot;Historia&quot; is local, Northumbrian concerns, and that Bede treated matters outside Northumbria as secondary to his main concern with northern history. Goffart sees the writing of the &quot;Historia&quot; as motivated by a political struggle in Northumbria between a party devoted to Wilfrid, and those opposed to Wilfrid&#x27;s policies.

Much of the &quot;current&quot; history in the &quot;Historia&quot; is concerned with Wilfrid, who was a bishop in Northumbria and whose stormy career is documented not only in Bede&#x27;s works but in a &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;. A theme in Bede&#x27;s treatment of Wilfrid is the need to minimize the conflict between Wilfrid and Theodore of Tarsus, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was involved in many of Wilfrid&#x27;s difficulties.

The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; includes many accounts of miracles and visions. These were &quot;de rigueur&quot; in medieval religious narrative, but Bede appears to have avoided relating the more extraordinary tales; and, remarkably, he makes almost no claims for miraculous events at his own monastery. There is no doubt that Bede did believe in miracles, but the ones he does include are often stories of healing, or of events that could plausibly be explained naturally. The miracles served the purpose of setting an example to the reader, and Bede explicitly states that his goal is to teach morality through history, saying &quot;If history records good things of good men, the thoughtful reader is encouraged to imitate what is good; if it records evil of wicked men, the devout reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse.&quot;

==Bede&#x27;s sparrow==
One of the most famous sections is the parable of the sparrow. In 627 King Edwin of Northumbria was converted to Christianity. In Bede&#x27;s account, the king held a meeting of his council to discuss acceptance of the new religion. The chief pagan priest, Coifu, declared that he had not had as much favour from the king or success in his undertakings as many other men even though no one had served the gods more faithfully, so he saw that they had no power and he would convert to Christianity. Then a leading councillor spoke:
:This is how the present life of man on earth, King, appears to me in comparison with that which is unknown to us. You are sitting feasting with your ealdormen and thegns in winter time; the fire is burning on the hearth in the middle of the hall and all inside is warm, while outside the wintry storms of rain and snow are raging; and a sparrow flies swiftly through the hall. It enters in at one door and quickly flies out through the other. For the few moments it is inside, the storm and wintry tempest cannot touch it, but after the briefest moment of calm, it flits from your sight, out of the wintry storm and into it again. So this life of man appears but for a moment; what follows or indeed what went before, we know not at all. If this new doctrine brings us more certain information, it seems right that we should accept it.

==Omissions and bias==
Bede apparently had no informant at any of the main Mercian religious houses. His information about Mercia came from Lastingham, now in North Yorkshire, and from Lindsey, a province on the borders of Northumbria and Mercia. As a result, there are noticeable gaps in his coverage of Mercian church history, such as his omission of the division of the huge Mercian diocese by Theodore in the late 7th century. Bede&#x27;s regional bias is apparent.

There were clearly gaps in Bede&#x27;s knowledge, but Bede also says little on some topics that he must have been familiar with. For example, although Bede recounts Wilfrid&#x27;s missionary activities, he does not give a full account of his conflict with Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury, or his ambition and aristocratic lifestyle. Only the existence of other sources such as the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; make it clear what Bede discreetly avoids saying. The omissions are not restricted to Wilfrid; Bede makes no mention at all of the English missionary Boniface, though it is unlikely he knew little of him; the final book contains less information about the church in his own day than could be expected. A possible explanation for Bede&#x27;s discretion may be found in his comment that one should not make public accusations against church figures, no matter what their sins; Bede may have found little good to say about the church in his day and hence preferred to keep silent. It is clear that he did have fault to find; his letter to Ecgberht contains several criticisms of the church.

The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; has more to say about episcopal events than it does about the monasteries of England. Bede does shed some light on monastic affairs; in particular, he comments in book V that many Northumbrians are laying aside their arms and entering monasteries &quot;rather than study the arts of war. What the result of this will be the future will show.&quot; This veiled comment, another example of Bede&#x27;s discretion in commenting on current affairs, could be interpreted as ominous given Bede&#x27;s more specific criticism of quasi-monasteries in his letter to Ecgberht, written three years later.

Bede&#x27;s account of life at the court of the Anglo-Saxon kings includes little of the violence that Gregory of Tours mentions as a frequent occurrence at the Frankish court. It is possible that the courts were as different as their descriptions make them appear but it is more likely that Bede omitted some of the violent reality. Bede states that he wrote the work as an instruction for rulers, in order that &quot;the thoughtful listener is spurred on to imitate the good&quot;. It also was no part of Bede&#x27;s purpose to describe the kings who did not convert to Christianity in the &quot;Historia&quot;.

==Anno Domini==
In 725 Bede wrote &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot; (), using something similar to the &quot;anno Domini&quot; era (BC/AD dating system) created by the monk Dionysius Exiguus in 525, continuing to use it throughout &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, becoming very influential in causing that era to be adopted thereafter in Western Europe. Specifically, he used &quot;anno ab incarnatione Domini&quot; (in the year from the incarnation of the Lord) or &quot;anno incarnationis dominicae&quot; (in the year of the incarnation of the Lord). He never abbreviated the term like the modern AD. Bede counted &quot;anno Domini&quot; from Christ&#x27;s birth, not from Christ&#x27;s conception.

Within this work, he was the first writer to use a term similar to the English &quot;before Christ&quot;. In book I chapter 2 he used &quot;ante incarnationis dominicae tempus&quot; (before the time of the incarnation of the Lord). However, the latter was not very influential—only this isolated use was repeated by other writers during the rest of the Middle Ages. The first extensive use of &quot;BC&quot; (hundreds of times) occurred in &quot;Fasciculus Temporum&quot; by Werner Rolevinck in 1474, alongside years of the world (&quot;anno mundi&quot;).

==Continuation of Bede==
Some early manuscripts contain additional annalistic entries that extend past the date of completion of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot;, with the latest entry dated 766. No manuscripts earlier than the twelfth century contain these entries, except for the entries for 731 through 734, which do occur in earlier manuscripts. Much of the material replicates what is found in Simeon of Durham&#x27;s chronicle; the remaining material is thought to derive from northern chronicles from the eighth century.

The &quot;Historia&quot; was translated into Old English sometime between the end of the ninth century and about 930; although the surviving manuscripts are predominantly in the West Saxon dialect, it is clear that the original contained Anglian features and so was presumably by a scholar from or trained in Mercia. The translation was once held to have been done by King Alfred of England, but this attribution is no longer accepted, and debate centres on how far it owes its origins to the patronage of Alfred and/or his associates.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, the earliest tranche of which was composed/compiled around the same time as the translation was made, drew heavily on the &quot;Historia&quot;, which formed the chronological framework of the early parts of the Chronicle.

==Assessment and influence==
The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than in the British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia&quot; come from the northern parts of the Carolingian Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at Strasbourg.

Modern historians have studied the &quot;Historia&quot; extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the &quot;Historia&quot;, but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the &quot;Historia&quot; was the culmination of Bede&#x27;s works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.

The &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history. His focus on the history of the organization of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. In the early Middle Ages, the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, and Alcuin&#x27;s &quot;Versus de patribus, regibus et sanctis Eboracensis ecclesiae&quot; all drew heavily on the text.

Likewise, the later medieval writers William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations. Early modern writers, such as Polydore Vergil and Matthew Parker, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilized the &quot;Historia&quot;, and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.

Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede&#x27;s accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, asserts that the &quot;Historia&#x27;s&quot; account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should be considered as current myth, not history. Historian Tom Holland writes that &quot;When, in the generations that followed Alfred, a united kingdom of England came to be forged, it was Bede&#x27;s history that provided it with a sense of ancestry that reached back beyond its foundation.&quot;

==Manuscript tradition==
Manuscripts of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; fall generally into two groups, known to historians as the &quot;c-type&quot; and the &quot;m-type&quot;. Charles Plummer, in his 1896 edition of Bede, identified six characteristic differences between the two manuscript types. For example, the c-type manuscripts omit one of the miracles attributed to St Oswald in book IV, chapter 14, and the c-type also includes the years 733 and 734 in the chronological summary at the end of the work, whereas the m-type manuscripts stop with the year 731.

Plummer thought that this meant the m-type was definitely earlier than the c-type, but this has been disputed by Bertram Colgrave in his 1969 edition of the text. Colgrave points out that the addition of a couple of annals is a simple alteration for a copyist to make at any point in the manuscript history; he also notes that the omission of one of Oswald&#x27;s miracles is not the mistake of a copyist, and strongly implies that the m-type is a later revision.

Some genealogical relationships can be discerned among the numerous manuscripts that have survived. The earliest manuscripts used to establish the c-text and m-text are as follows. The letters under the &quot;Version&quot; column are identifying letters used by historians to refer to these manuscripts.

===Relationships between the manuscripts===

With few exceptions, Continental copies of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; are of the m-type, while English copies are of the c-type. Among the c-texts, manuscript K includes only books IV and V, but C and O are complete. O is a later text than C but is independent of it and so the two are a valuable check on correctness. They are thought to have both derived from an earlier manuscript, marked &quot;c2&quot; in the diagram, which does not survive.

A comparison of K and c2 yields an accurate understanding of the original c-text, but for the first three books, which are not in K, it is sometimes impossible to know if a variant reading in C and O represents the original state of the c-text, or is a variation only found in c2. One long chapter, book I chapter 27, is also found in another manuscript, Rh. 95 at the Zürich Zentralbibliothek; this is another witness to the c-text and appears to be independent of c2, and so is useful as a further cross-check on the c-text.

The m-text depends largely on manuscripts M and L, which are very early copies, made not long after Bede&#x27;s death. Both seem likely to have been taken from the original, though this is not certain. Three further manuscripts, U, E, and N, are all apparently the descendants of a Northumbrian manuscript that does not survive but which went to the continent in the late 8th century. These three are all early manuscripts, but are less useful than might be thought, since L and M are themselves so close to the original.

The text of both the m-type and c-type seems to have been accurately copied. Taking a consensus text from the earliest manuscripts, Bertram Colgrave counted 32 places where there was an apparent error of some kind. However, 26 of these are to be found within a transcription from an earlier source, and it is apparent by checking independent copies of those sources that in such cases Bede copied the mistake into his own text.

===History of the manuscripts===
*K appears to have been written in Northumbria in the late 8th century. Only books IV and V survive; the others were probably lost during the Middle Ages. The manuscript bears a 15th-century pressmark of the Abbey of Fulda.
*C, also known as the Tiberius Bede, was written in the south of England in the second half of the 8th century. Plummer argued that it was from Durham, but this is dismissed by Colgrave. The manuscript contains glosses in Old English that were added in the south during the 9th century.
*O dates to the early 11th century, and has subsequent corrections many of which are from the 12th century.
*L, also known as the St Petersburg Bede, was copied by four scribes no later than 747. The scribes were probably at either Wearmouth or Jarrow Abbey.
*M, also known as the Moore Bede, was written in Northumbria in 737 or shortly thereafter. The manuscript was owned at one time by John Moore, the Bishop of Ely, and as a result it is known as the Moore MS. Moore&#x27;s collection was purchased by King George I and given to Cambridge University in 1715, where it still resides.
*U dates to the late 8th century, and is thought to be a copy, made on the continent, of an earlier Northumbrian manuscript (&quot;c2&quot; in the diagram above). It has been at Weissenburg since the end of the Middle Ages.
*E dates from the middle third of the 9th century. In 800, a list was made of books at Würzburg cathedral; the list includes one &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot; and E may be a copy of that manuscript. Subsequently, E is known to have been in the possession of Ebrach Abbey.
*N was copied in the 9th century by several scribes; at one point it was owned by St Hubert in the Ardennes.

Manuscripts written before 900 include:

* Corbie MS, Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris
* St Gall Abbey Library

Copies are sparse throughout the 10th century and for much of the 11th century. The greatest number of copies of Bede&#x27;s work was made in the 12th century, but there was a significant revival of interest in the 14th and 15th centuries. Many of the copies are of English provenance, but also surprisingly many are Continental.

==Printing history==
The first printed copy of the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; appeared from the press of Heinrich Eggestein in Strasbourg, probably between 1475 and 1480. A defect in the text allows the identification of the manuscript Eggestein used; it subsequently appeared in a catalogue of the Vienna Dominicans of 1513. Eggestein had also printed an edition of Rufinus&#x27;s translation of Eusebius&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, and the two works were reprinted, bound as a single volume, on 14 March 1500 by Georg Husner, also of Strasbourg. Another reprint appeared on 7 December 1506, from Heinrich Gran and S. Ryman at Haguenau.

A Paris edition appeared in 1544, and in 1550 John de Grave produced an edition at Antwerp. Two reprints of this edition appeared, in 1566 and 1601. In 1563, Johann Herwagen included it in volume III of his eight-volume &quot;Opera Omnia&quot;, and this was in turn reprinted in 1612 and 1688. Michael Sonnius produced an edition in Paris in 1587, including the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; in a collection of other historical works; and in 1587 Johann Commelin included it in a similar compilation, printed at Heidelberg. In 1643, Abraham Whelock produced at Cambridge an edition with the Old English text and the Latin text in parallel columns, the first in England.

All of the above editions were based on the C-text. The first edition to use the m-type manuscripts was printed by Pierre Chifflet in 1681, using a descendant of the Moore MS. For the 1722 edition, John Smith obtained the Moore MS., and also, having access to two copies in the Cotton Library, was able to print a very high-quality edition. Smith undertook his edition under the influence of Thomas Gale, encouraged by Ralph Thoresby, and with assistance of Humfrey Wanley on Old English.

He spent the majority of his time residing in Cambridge, and working on it, but did not live to complete the preparation. His son George brought out in 1722 the &quot;Historiæ Ecclesiasticæ Gentis Anglorum Libri Quinque, auctore Venerabili Bæda ... cura et studio Johannis Smith, S. T. P.&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press. It contains the preface to &quot;The Reckoning of Time&quot;, and a world-chronicle. It had the Old English version of the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica&quot;. Smith&#x27;s edition is described by David C. Douglas as &quot;an enormous advance&quot; on previous ones, adding that textual criticism of Bede hardly then changed until 1896, when the Plummer edition appeared.

Subsequently, the most notable edition was that of Charles Plummer, whose 1896 &quot;Venerabilis Bedae Opera Historica&quot;, with a full commentary, has been a foundation-stone for all subsequent scholarship.

<doc id="956901" wikidata="Q525308" url="?curid=956901" title="Enid Greene Mickelsen">
<text>Enid Greene Mickelsen, formerly Enid Greene Waldholtz (born June 5, 1958), is an American politician from the state of Utah who served one term in the United States House of Representatives. She was the third woman and first Republican woman elected to Congress from Utah. No woman was elected to Congress from Utah from her retirement in 1997 until Mia Love&#x27;s election in 2014.

==Early life==
Greene was born in San Rafael, California, to naval officer and financier D. Forrest Greene and Gerda Marie Beyer. She is one of five children. She graduated from East High School and earned her B.A. from the University of Utah in 1980. She received her J.D. degree from Brigham Young University in 1983.

She worked as a lawyer for software company Novell and then at a Salt Lake City law firm. She was deputy chief of staff for Governor Norman H. Bangerter.

Mickelsen and Jon Huntsman Jr. were co-directors of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign in Utah.

==Career==
===Run for the U.S. House of Representatives===
While serving as chair of the Young Republican National Federation (YRNF), Enid met Joe Waldholtz, and they were soon in a relationship. Greene ran for the House of Representatives in 1992 against Karen Shepherd for the Utah Second District, which was entirely contained in Salt Lake County at that time, losing by four percentage points.

===Second run for U.S. House of Representatives===
Greene married Waldholtz in 1993. After her marriage, Greene took the name &quot;Enid Greene Waldholtz&quot;. During her 1994 rematch against Shepherd, Joe acted as her campaign manager. Her campaign spent approximately $2 million, the most expensive House race in the country that year. Greene was swept into the 104th Congress in the Republican landslide in November. She was named to the House Rules Committee, the first freshman on that committee in over 80 years.

In March 1995, she announced she was pregnant. Greene became the second representative ever to give birth while in office (the first being Yvonne Brathwaite Burke) and the first Republican.

===Misuse of funds===
Her term was marred with scandal as her campaign was accused of campaign finance violations. Almost $1.8 million of the money spent in the 1994 campaign came from her husband, Joe, who had embezzled nearly $4 million from her father. Joe Waldholtz disappeared in November 1995 for six days before surrendering to the police. During that time, she announced that she was suing for divorce, for custody of her daughter, and to change her name to &#x27;Enid Greene&#x27;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Waldholtz was addicted to heroin.

Under pressure from Utah Republicans, she announced on March 5, 1996, that she would not seek re-election to Congress. Joe Waldholtz pleaded guilty to federal charges of tax, bank, and campaign fraud, and then, while out on parole, was subsequently convicted of forging insurance and Veterans Affairs checks from his stepmother and his late father. He was sentenced to three to 15 years in prison.

===Comeback===
Greene slowly returned to Utah state politics. In 2003, she was elected vice chair of the Utah Republican Party.

Greene was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of Utah in 2004, but her ticket with gubernatorial candidate Nolan Karras was unsuccessful, garnering only 34% of the vote in the Republican primary.

After losing in the primary, Greene became Utah Republican vice chair. She became acting chair of the Utah Republican Party upon the resignation of Joe Cannon in November 2006. She was unanimously elected to serve as state party chair in February 2007 until the next convention in June 2007.

Enid Greene remarried in 2008 to then sheriff&#x27;s deputy, and current judge, Scott J. Mickelsen. She was a delegate at the 2012 Republican National convention, served as chair of the 2016 Republican National Convention Site Selection Committee, and was appointed by RNC Chair Reince Priebus as chair of the 2016 Republican Convention Rules Committee.

==Electoral history==
 Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1992, Eileen Koschak of the Socialist Workers party received 650 votes.

<text>In computers and technology, a postmaster is the administrator of a mail server. Nearly every domain should have the e-mail address postmaster@example.com where errors in e-mail processing are directed. Error e-mails automatically generated by mail servers&#x27; MTAs usually appear to have been sent to the postmaster address.

Every domain that supports the SMTP protocol for electronic mail is required by RFC 5321 and, as early as 1982, by RFC 822, to have the postmaster address. The rfc-ignorant.org website used to maintain a list of domains that do not comply with the RFC based on this requirement, but was shut down in November 2012. The website RFC2 Realtime List expanded to include rfc-ignorant&#x27;s lists after they shut down.

Quoting from the RFC:
Any system that includes an SMTP server supporting mail relaying or delivery MUST support the reserved mailbox &quot;postmaster&quot; as a case-insensitive local name. This postmaster address is not strictly necessary if the server always returns 554 on connection opening (as described in section 3.1). The requirement to accept mail for postmaster implies that RCPT commands which specify a mailbox for postmaster at any of the domains for which the SMTP server provides mail service, as well as the special case of &quot;RCPT TO:&lt;Postmaster&gt;&quot; (with no domain specification), MUST be supported.

SMTP systems are expected to make every reasonable effort to accept mail directed to Postmaster from any other system on the Internet. In extreme cases (such as to contain a denial of service attack or other breach of security) an SMTP server may block mail directed to Postmaster. However, such arrangements SHOULD be narrowly tailored so as to avoid blocking messages which are not part of such attacks.
Since most domains have a postmaster address, it is commonly targeted by spamming operations. Even if not directly spammed, a postmaster address may be sent bounced spam from other servers that mistakenly trust fake return-paths commonly used in spam.

<text>Carsharing or car sharing (AU, NZ, CA, TH, &amp; US) or car clubs (UK) is a model of car rental where people rent cars for short periods of time, often by the hour. It differs from traditional car rental in that the owners of the cars are often private individuals themselves, and the car sharing facilitator is generally distinct from the car owner. Car sharing is part of a larger trend of shared mobility.

Car sharing enables an occasional use of a vehicle or access to different brands of vehicles. The renting organization may be a commercial business. Users can also organize as a company, public agency, cooperative, or &quot;ad hoc&quot; grouping. The network of cars on the network becomes available to the users through a variety of means, ranging from the simplicity of using an app to unlock the car in real time, to meeting the owner of the car in order to exchange keys. As of January 2020 the world&#x27;s top city for car sharing is Moscow with more than 30,000 vehicles. The majority of car sharing vehicles in Moscow are owned by private companies.

== History ==
=== Early days ===

The first reference to car sharing in print identifies the &quot;Selbstfahrergenossenschaft&quot; car share program in a housing cooperative that began in Zürich in 1948. By the 1960s, as innovators, industrialists, cities, and public authorities studied the possibility of high-technology transportation – mainly computer-based small vehicle systems (almost all of them on separate guideways) – it was possible to spot some early precursors to present-day service ideas and control technologies.

The early 1970s saw the first whole-system car share projects. The ProcoTip system in France lasted about two years. A much more ambitious project called the Witkar was launched in Amsterdam by the founders of the 1965 white bicycles project. A sophisticated project based on small electric vehicles, electronic controls for reservations and return, and plans for a large number of stations covering the entire city. The project was abandoned in the mid-1980s.

In July 1977, the first official British experiment in car sharing started in Suffolk. An office in Ipswich provided a &quot;Share-a-Car&quot; service for &quot;putting motorists who are interested in sharing car journeys in touch with each other.&quot; In 1978, the Agricultural Research Council granted the University of Leeds £16,577 &quot;for an investigation and simulation of carsharing&quot;. The scheme was not intended for different drivers of a single car but for a driver offering seats in their car, which is actually known as carpooling, not car sharing.

The 1980s and first half of the 1990s was a &quot;coming of age&quot; period for car sharing, with continued slow growth, mainly of smaller non-profit systems, mostly in Switzerland and Germany but also on a smaller scale in Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S.

Carsharing in North America began in Quebec City in 1994 after Benoît Robert started a company called Communauto that is still a leader in car sharing globally. Cycling advocate and environmentalist Claire Morissette (1950–2007) played a major role in its evolution starting in 1995, when Communauto established itself in Montreal as a private company.

=== Rapid growth in the United States ===

The first car-sharing company in the U.S. was CarSharing Portland, founded by Dave Brook in March by 1998 after a visit from Conrad Wagner of Mobility Switzerland. Conrad and Dave would also help establish Flexcar in Seattle, which launched in 2000, the same year as competitor Zipcar on the east coast. In April 2001, Carsharing Portland, then with 25 vehicles, merged with Flexcar, as its first expansion city.

Zipcar and City Car Club were founded in 2000. City CarShare was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2001 as a non-profit group. Several car rental companies launched their own car sharing services beginning in 2008, including Avis on Location by Avis, Hertz on Demand (formerly known as Connect by Hertz), operating in the U.S. and Europe; Uhaul Car Share owned by U-Haul, and WeCar by Enterprise Rent-A-Car. By 2010, when various peer-to-peer carsharing systems were introduced. 

Zipcar accounted for 80 percent of the U.S. car sharing market in 2010 and half of all car-sharers worldwide with 730,000 members sharing 11,000 vehicles.

In 2008, City CarShare introduced the first wheelchair carrying car share vehicle, the &quot;Access Mobile&quot;, specifically designed as a fleet vehicle shared with non-wheelchair users.

Car sharing is noted as a tool for achieving vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets in the California Transport Plan (CTP) 2040 to reduce congestion and pollution.

=== Development and growth ===

Car sharing has also spread to other global markets with dense urban populations (such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia and Turkey) given that population density is often a critical determinant of success for car sharing. Successful car sharing development has tended to be associated mainly with densely populated areas, such as city centers and more recently university and other campuses. There are some programs (mostly in Europe) for providing services in lower density and rural areas. Low-density areas are considered more difficult to serve with car sharing because of the lack of alternative modes of transportation and the potentially larger distance that users must travel to reach the cars.

Many building developers are now incorporating share-cars into their developments as an added value to tenants, and municipal government bodies around the world are starting to stipulate the implementation of a car sharing service in new buildings, as a sustainability initiative. These trends have created a demand for a new model of car sharing – residential, private-access share-cars that are typically underwritten by the Homeowner association. In Germany a pilot project has been started by the semiconductor manufacturer Infineon to replace regular pool vehicles with a corporate car sharing system. Replacing private automobiles with shared ones directly reduces demand for parking spaces. The fact that only a certain number of cars can be in use at any one time may reduce traffic congestion at peak times. Even more important for congestion, the strong metering of costs provides a cost incentive to drive less. With owned automobiles many expenses are sunk costs and thus independent of how much the car is driven (such as original purchase, insurance, registration, and some maintenance).

According to Navigant Consulting, global carsharing services revenue is expected to grow to billion by 2020, with over 12 million members worldwide. The main factors driving the growth of carsharing are the rising levels of congestion faced by city dwellers; shifting generational mindsets about car ownership; the increasing costs of personal vehicle ownership; and a convergence of business models. Carsharing operators increasingly opt to brand parts of their fleets with third-party advertising in order to increase revenue and improve competitiveness (Transit media).

For future applications, many carsharing companies invest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) to reduce petroleum consumption. One idea is to calculate and compensate all emissions on behalf of your drivers according to the Kyoto protocol, e.g. via reforestation schemes. The world&#x27;s first certified carbon neutral carsharing service is Respiro carsharing in Madrid and is also done by Australian p2p car sharing platform Car Next Door.

The most important technological innovation to affect the carsharing market is self-driving cars. It is expected that most self-driving vehicles won&#x27;t be owned by individuals, but will rather be shared. Some companies, like Ernst &amp; Young, have also started to use blockchain technology to record ownership, usage of shared vehicles and insurance information.

In July 2018, Volkswagen announced its intention to launch an all-electric car-sharing service by 2019. In August 2018, the carsharing startup Getaround rose $300 million from Softbank. According to Moscow&#x27;s authority, the number of carsharing journeys in the city averaged 30,000 a day between January and September 2018.

=== Global development and comparison in urban regions ===
Car-sharing is growing in urban regions as more people around the world adopt it. The world&#x27;s top cities for car-sharing in 2020 were
Moscow, (Russia) with 30.0K vehicles, Tokyo, (Japan) with 16.5K vehicles, Beijing (China) with 15.4K vehicles, Shanghai, (China) with 13.9K vehicles, Guangzhou, (China) with 4.2K vehicles. A new survey displayed that car sharing has become fashionable in Germany.

== Types of car sharing ==

Generally, car sharing programs fall into one of four sharing models: round-trip, one-way, peer-to-peer, or fractional.

=== Station-based car sharing ===
With station-based (or round-trip) car sharing, the cars are permanently stationed at designated stations, typically simply reserved parking spaces. Members pick up the vehicle at the station, and must return it there. The car must usually be reserved for a specific amount of time in advance, and must be returned before that time ends. Payment is usually both by the hour, and by the distance driven. In exchange, a vehicle can be reserved days or weeks in advance, and it is often possible to reserve a specific type of vehicle, such as one with more seats or greater cargo capacity.

=== One-way/free-floating car sharing ===

One-way car sharing enables users to begin and end their trip at different locations through free floating zones or station-based models with designated parking locations. As of 2017, free-floating car sharing is available in 55 cities and 20 countries worldwide, with 40,000 vehicles and serving 5.6 million users, with Europe and North America representing the majority of the market. In Europe, free floating services took up more than 65 percent in car sharing membership.

The service is expected to reach 14.3 million users with more than 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2022.

===By conventional companies===

In corporate car sharing, the company shares the vehicles and allows multiple employees (rather than just one) to make use of a company car, at times when they actually need it. The vehicles are made available from a corporate car sharing pool, and shared for a fixed or flexible period of time. One shared car could replace up to 8 non-shared cars. However, car-sharing does involves an additional processing and associated costs. Still, it reduces fleet-related costs over the long term and allow employees to save not only on costs but also on time. 

=== Peer-to-peer car sharing ===

Peer-to-peer car sharing, sometimes referred to as P2P or Personal Vehicle Sharing, operates similarly to round-trip car sharing in trip and payment type. However, the vehicles themselves are typically privately owned or leased with the sharing system operated by a third-party.

=== Fractional ownership ===
Fractional ownership allows users to co-own a vehicle and share its costs and use. Neighborhood fractional ownership car sharing is often promoted as an alternative to owning a car where public transit, walking, and cycling can be used most of the time and a car is only necessary for out-of-town trips, moving large items, or special occasions. It can also be an alternative to owning multiple cars for households with more than one driver.

== Difference from traditional car rentals ==

Car sharing differs from traditional car rentals in the following ways:

* Car sharing is not limited by office hours
* Reservation, pickup, and return is all self-service
* Vehicles can be rented by the minute, by the hour, as well as by the day
* Users are members and have been pre-approved to drive (background driving checks have been performed and a payment mechanism has been established).
* Vehicle locations are distributed throughout the service area, and often located for access by public transport.
* Insurance: (this section is US specific) state minimum liability insurance (only $5000 in some states), comprehensive and collision insurance. They do not provide uninsured, under-insured or personal injury protection insurance. 
* Fuel costs are included in the rates.
* Vehicles are not serviced (cleaning, fueling) after each use, although certain programs (such as Car2Go or GoGet) continuously clean and fuel their fleet. Members are usually required to refuel the vehicles if fuel runs low, with the cost borne by the car sharing provider.

With car sharing, individuals have access to private cars without having costs and responsibilities associated with car ownership (except for fractional ownerships). Some car share operations (CSOs) cooperate with local car rental firms, in particular in situations wherein classic rental may be the cheaper option.

The insurance policies on carsharing greatly varies among companies, but all car sharing firms provide insurance that at least meets the legal minimum requirements for the given region of operation. Rob Lieber of &quot;The New York Times&quot; has criticized car sharing firms such as Zipcar for the paltry coverage afforded car sharing drivers.

== Technology ==

The technology of CSOs varies enormously, from simple manual systems using key boxes and log books to increasingly complex computer-based systems (e.g. partially automated and fully automated systems) with supporting software packages that handle a growing array of back office functions. The simplest CSOs have only one or two pick-up points, but more advanced systems allow cars to be picked up and dropped off at any available public parking space within a designated operating area.

Once the reservations are completed and confirmed, the car will then be delivered at the time and place scheduled. There will be a small card reader mounted on the windshield. Once the customer places their membership card on the reader, it will use what is called blink technology to activate the time and unlock the car. The reader will not work until it is time for that specific reservation. The keys can then be found somewhere inside the car such as the glove compartment. Depending on the company, the customer may be provided with a key to a lock box that contains the ignition key itself. In some cases the car can be unlocked using a mobile phone and the car can even be started using the phone as well.

Many car sharing networks price their services as a small start up fee and then a mileage fee for the distance driven in the car. Usually the app will include insurance, gas cards, and upkeep to their fleet of cars at no additional charge to the customer.

<text>Khulna (, ) is the third-largest city in Bangladesh, after Dhaka and Chittagong. It is the administrative centre of the Khulna District and the Khulna Division. It is the divisional centre of 10 districts of the division. Khulna is also the second largest port city of Bangladesh after Chittagong because of Port of Mongla.

Khulna&#x27;s economy is mainly marine, sea port and local industry based and it is the third-largest in Bangladesh, contributing $53 billion in gross regional domestic product and $95 billion in purchasing power parity (PPP) in 2020.

Khulna is on the Rupsha and Bhairab River, a strategic industrial point in southwestern Bangladesh. It is also an important industrial hub in Bangladeshi industry, hosting many of the nation&#x27;s largest companies. Khulna&#x27;s economy is effected by the Port of Mongla, Bangladesh&#x27;s second-largest seaport.

A colonial steamboat service, which includes the &quot;Tern&quot;, &quot;Osrich&quot; and &quot;Lepcha&quot;, operates on the river route to the city. Khulna is considered the gateway to the Sundarbans, the world&#x27;s largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger. It is north of the Mosque City of Bagerhat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
Khulna was part of the ancient kingdoms of Vanga, Gangaridai and Samatata. After the end of the Pala Empire, it was ruled by the Sena dynasty during the 12th-century reign of Ballala Sena, and formed part of the Bagri division of Bengal.
During the 14th century, Shamsuddin Firoz Shah was the first Muslim ruler to arrive in the city. Muslim settlements increased during the time of Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, and many mosques and shrines were established. A Muslim saint, Khan Jahan Ali, acquired a &quot;jagir&quot; (fiefdom) encompassing a large part of Khulna Division from the king of Gauḍa during the 15th century and renamed the region as Jahanabad. Ali ruled until he died in 1459.

After Ali&#x27;s death, the city became part of the Bengal Sultanate. During the reign of Daud Khan Karrani in the 16th century, Vikramaditya (one of Karrani&#x27;s chief ministers) obtained a grant in southern Bengal—including Khulna—when Karrani was fighting the Mughals. Vikramaditya established a sovereign kingdom with its capital at Iswaripur (in present-day Satkhira District). He was succeeded by his son, Pratapaditya, who gained preeminence over the Baro-Bhuyans and controlled southern Bengal. Vikramaditya was defeated by Raja Man Singh I, a Hindu Rajput general of the Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1611.

Khulna was ruled by autonomous Bengali nawabs until 1793 when the British East India Company abolished &quot;nizamat&quot; (local rule) and took control of the city. Becoming part of Jessore District in 1842, it became the headquarters of Khulna District (the Khulna and Bagerhat subdivisions of Jessore District, the Satkhira subdivision of 24 Parganas district, and the Sundarbans) in 1882.

<text>James Flint is a British novelist and journalist. Born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1968, he did a journalistic apprenticeship on the &quot;Times of India&quot; in New Delhi before studying philosophy and psychology at Wadham College, Oxford. On graduating he spent a year in New York City studying jazz theory and technique, returning to the UK to take an MA in Philosophy and Literature at the University of Warwick. After graduating, he worked at &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in London, before becoming a contributing editor of the &quot;Mute&quot; magazine and a section editor of &quot;Wired UK&quot;.

Flint is the author of the novels &quot;Habitus&quot;, &quot;52 Ways to Magic America&quot;, which won the Amazon.co.uk Bursary Award for the year 2000; and &quot;The Book of Ash&quot;, which was inspired by the life of the nuclear artist James Acord and won the 2003 Arts Council Writers’ Award. He has also published a short story collection &quot;Soft Apocalypse – Twelve Tales from the Turn of the Millennium&quot; (2004: Au Diable Vauvert). His short fiction has appeared in collections published by Penguin Books, the New English Library and the ICA. When it was published in France in 2002, &quot;Habitus&quot; was judged as in the top five foreign novels of that year&#x27;s Rentrée Littéraire.

In 2002, one of Flint&#x27;s stories (&quot;The Nuclear Train&quot;) was filmed for Channel 4 by the director Dan Saul. Flint also scripted the film installation &quot;Little Earth&quot; and co-wrote &#x27;Like an Octogenarian&#x27; with Sebastian Doggart for A&amp;E Network&#x27;s 2006 show &quot;15 Films About Madonna&quot;. Between 2004 and 2007 he ran the Film Tent at the Port Eliot Festival, which featured films and talks from filmmakers including Mike Figgis and Kevin Allen.

In December 2006, Flint took a full-time position as the digital Arts and Features editor at the Telegraph Media Group. In 2007 he oversaw the set up and launch of Telegraph Earth and was subsequently promoted to be the editorial head of digital development. After spending a year as General Manager of Telegraph TV, he was appointed editor of the weekly world edition of the Telegraph newspaper and its sister website telegraph.co.uk/expat.

As of July 2021, he is currently the co-founder and CEO of the health communications start-up Hospify.

<doc id="956934" wikidata="Q1606050" url="?curid=956934" title="St.George Bank">
<text>St.George Bank is an Australian bank with its headquarters in Sydney. Since a 2008 merger, the bank has been part of Westpac, having previously been an independent legal entity. In 2010, St.George was deregistered as a company and ceased to be a standalone authorised deposit-taking institution.

The bank provides services primarily in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, but with growing representation across a number of industry and business segments in Queensland and Western Australia, and in Victoria before the relaunch of the Bank of Melbourne (2011) brand in July 2011 (also another division of Westpac). St.George also operates in South Australia and the Northern Territory under its subsidiary BankSA. The bank has a large number of retail branches and ATMs across Australia, and some back office operations in Bangalore, India.

== History ==

===Origins===

The current bank is the result of the merger and/or acquisition of a number of building societies and banks.

The St.George Co-operative Building Society Ltd. was formed on 6 May 1937 in the Sydney suburb of Hurstville, with George Cross as the first chairman of the board. The Cronulla &amp; District Co-operative Building Society was formed in June 1937. The two Co-operatives merged in 1945, and with the post-war housing boom, the St.George and Cronulla Building Society expanded rapidly, with 38 branches established by 1955. In 1955, the society became a Permanent Building Society, which enabled its loans to be larger and terms shorter. In 1961 the first Sydney branch opened in Miranda, followed by the first Sydney city branch in August 1963. The expansion of the branch network continued through the 1960s. The society also operated 41 agencies.

In 1972, St.George was the first building society to &#x27;go on-line&#x27; with the installation of an IBM mainframe computer connected to 30 terminals. Shortly after, the black light signature system for passbooks was introduced, a system which had been adopted by the banks in the late 1960s.

In 1979, radio announcer John Laws almost caused a run on St.George Building Society when he told his listeners &quot;a big building society is going to go bust&quot;. St.George kept its doors open and paid out every withdrawal. The then Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, later stood outside a branch and said he could personally guarantee the society&#x27;s financial security.

In the 1990s, the headquarters moved to Montgomery Street, Kogarah, and in 1992, the society gained its banking licence, demutualised, and became a public company.

The NSW Permanent Building &amp; Investment Society was established in 1939. The society became a bank in 1985 under the name Advance Bank.

In 1848, the Savings Bank of South Australia opened for business in Gawler Place, Adelaide, and the organisation which became the State Bank of South Australia opened in rural South Australia. Both were guaranteed by the Government of South Australia. The two banks were merged in 1984 and traded as the State Bank of South Australia, retaining the Government guarantee. After excessive insufficiently secured lending through the 1980s, the bank collapsed, and because of the guarantee, was bailed out by the State Government. In 1992 the bank was split into the &quot;bad bank&quot; with the non-performing debts, and the &quot;good bank&quot;.
The &quot;good bank&quot; was acquired by the Advance Bank, who kept it operating as a separate entity under the name of the Bank of South Australia, trading as BankSA.

In 1991 St.George made its first interstate acquisition by buying the Victorian Savings and Loan Society, which had branches in a number of regional cities and towns.

Three years later in 1994 St.george bought the retails commercial bank and finance divisions of Barclays Bank Australia, incorporating 550 staff and 18 branches into the group.

Advance Bank (and its BankSA subsidiary) was in turn taken over in 1997 by St.George Bank.

Like Advance Bank, St.George has continued to run BankSA as a separate entity – it has 55 branches in metropolitan Adelaide, 66 in rural South Australia (totalling 121 overall in the state, more than any other bank in South Australia), four in the Northern Territory and one in Queensland.

On 1 November 2006, St.George Bank posted a net profit of A$1bn for 2005/06, a 17.9 per cent increase on the previous year, and a record profit for the bank. At the time of its acquisition by Westpac in 2008, St.George Bank Limited (as it was then known) was the fifth largest bank operating in Australia.

In 2016, St George Bank moved to its present headquarters in Tower 2 of the International Towers complex in the central Sydney area of Barangaroo.

=== Merger with Westpac ===

On 14 November 2007, Paul Fegan was announced as the new CEO of the St.George Bank, to replace Gail Kelly who had departed on 17 August 2007 to become CEO of Westpac.

On 9 May 2008, Westpac and St.George released communications outlining an intention to merge, which was approved by St.George shareholders on 13 November 2008, and upheld by the Australian Federal Court on 17 November 2008. Immediately following the court decision, Paul Fegan announced his resignation as CEO and managing director. St.George, and BankSA, became a subsidiary of Westpac on 1 December 2008.

The all-stock deal valued St.George at A$18.6 billion (US$17.5 billion), or A$33.10 a share, a premium of 28.5% to the closing price of St.George shares on 9 May in Australia. St.George shareholders received 1.31 Westpac shares for each St.George share and owned 28.1% of the new entity.

Upon completion of the merger with Westpac, Greg Bartlett (former group executive in charge of St.George Institutional and Business Bank) was appointed CEO of the bank, reporting to Westpac&#x27;s then-CEO, Gail Kelly.

=== Relaunch of Bank of Melbourne ===
The Bank of Melbourne is a subsidiary of Westpac Banking Corporation, and was relaunched in August 2011. Previously, Westpac Banking Corporation had purchased the old Bank of Melbourne business in 1997 (a separate and independently operating building society located in Melbourne), and after some preliminary steps, subsequently closed its doors in 2002 and merged the remaining operations under the Westpac banner. The relaunched Bank of Melbourne replaced the St.George Bank brand completely throughout Victoria.

===Recent years===
In late 2010, Greg Bartlett announced that he would step down as chief executive officer in December after a long and successful tenure with the company. Rob Chapman (managing director of BankSA) would be appointed in the role.

Since coming to office, Rob Chapman has led St.George Bank in conjunction with, and with support from its parent, Westpac Banking Corporation, on a multibranded strategy which has seen St.George take Group business units such as RAMS and the relaunched Bank of Melbourne underneath its banner. The bank is now commonly referred to as the St.George Banking Group.

== Market positioning ==
St.George typically promotes itself as more friendly and customer-service-oriented than the &quot;big four&quot; banks operating nationally in Australia, although it is now a part of the Westpac Group. The bank was previously recognised as a customer service leader in third party surveys, but the 2010 CHOICE consumer survey showed customer satisfaction was on par with the &quot;big four&quot;, lagging behind small credit providers. 

Despite its roots as a building society specialising in home and consumer lending, today the bank provides funding to a variety of specialist industries and market segments including commercial property construction and development, invoice discounting, interest rate hedging, foreign exchange, trade finance and automotive finance (formerly the Barclay Bank Business). The Automotive Finance division also operates under St.George Finance Limited and St.George Motor Finance Limited (a subsidiary of St.George Bank) and has been rebranded in Victoria under the relaunched Bank of Melbourne.

== Offshore ==

St.George has moved parts of its back office work to India. In 2007, cards and loan services work was transferred to IBM in Bangalore, and most recently 22 Kogarah jobs went to India, bringing the total to about 122. This is in addition to the approximately 70 information technology jobs that had been moved to the Indian firms Tata Consultancy Services and Hindustan Computers Limited.

In more recent times, St.George bank has begun to reverse the trend to offshore processing, bringing card operations back to Australia.

<text>Flexcar was an American vehicle subscription company with headquarters located in Boston, Massachusetts.

==History==
In January 2000, the Flexcar service was launched to 100 members served by four cars in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. The company targeted drivers who made occasional use of a vehicle as well as drivers who wanted occasional access to a vehicle of a different type than they use day-to-day. Flexcar claimed that the service was economically beneficial to anyone whose car would be away from their home about 15 hours a week and did not need a car for their daily commute to work.

In several of its cities, the company had formed a public–private partnership with local public transit entities. For example, in Seattle, they were partnered with King County Metro Transit, which operates the area&#x27;s buses.

In April 2001, Flexcar became the first car-sharing company in the U.S. to expand to a second city by acquiring CarSharing Portland in Portland. At the time, Flexcar&#x27;s customer base in Seattle included over 1300 members sharing 40 cars. Carsharing Portland, which began business in March 1998, had at the time of its acquisition over 500 members with 25 vehicles in and around downtown Portland. 

The company also started an initiative to convince Downtown Seattle employers to join their program as business members rather than maintaining their own fleet vehicles. Other market segments included placing vehicles at transit stations to provide &quot;last mile&quot; connectivity between transit and suburban office locations and providing subsidized vehicle access as part of low-income &quot;jobs access&quot; programs. 

In August 2005, Revolution LLC, the holding company owned by Steve Case, founder of America Online, purchased a 60% holding interest in Flexcar. The company announced that this investment would lead to a rapid expansion of their operations.

In January 2007, Flexcar changed their billing structure of their hourly rentals. These changes replaced their flat fee for a variable pricing plan, which calculated cost on peak and non-peak hours with mileage limited to 150 miles per day. Members were notified on the organization&#x27;s website and by letter that, &quot;[v]ariable pricing provides two benefits. Members with flexible schedules can now save money by reserving the car during its &#x27;off-peak&#x27; time, in this case, on the weekend. Because some members will shift their trips to &#x27;off-peak&#x27; times, the car’s availability should also improve during its &#x27;peak&#x27; times as well.&quot;

On October 30, 2007, Flexcar executives announced a merger with car-sharing rival Zipcar. The merger consolidated the operations of the two corporations. Executives from both companies, in the announcement of the merger, stated that the Flexcar headquarters in Seattle would be closed, possibly resulting in the loss of jobs as operations transferred to Zipcar&#x27;s headquarters in Boston.

<doc id="956941" wikidata="Q1851454" url="?curid=956941" title="The Seafarer (poem)">
<text>The Seafarer is an Old English poem giving a first-person account of a man alone on the sea. The poem consists of 124 lines, followed by the single word &quot;Amen&quot;. It is recorded only at folios 81 verso – 83 recto of the tenth-century Exeter Book, one of the four surviving manuscripts of Old English poetry. It has most often, though not always, been categorised as an elegy, a poetic genre commonly assigned to a particular group of Old English poems that reflect on spiritual and earthly melancholy.

== Summary ==

Much scholarship suggests that the poem is told from the point of view of an old seafarer who is reminiscing and evaluating his life as he has lived it. The seafarer describes the desolate hardships of life on the wintry sea. He describes the anxious feelings, cold-wetness, and solitude of the sea voyage in contrast to life on land where men are surrounded by kinsmen, free from dangers, and full on food and wine. The climate on land then begins to resemble that of the wintry sea, and the speaker shifts his tone from the dreariness of the winter voyage and begins to describe his yearning for the sea. Time passes through the seasons from winter—&quot;it snowed from the north&quot;—to spring—&quot;groves assume blossoms&quot;—and to summer—&quot;the cuckoo forebodes, or forewarns&quot;.

Then the speaker again shifts, this time not in tone, but in subject matter. The sea is no longer explicitly mentioned; instead the speaker preaches about steering a steadfast path to heaven. He asserts that &quot;earthly happiness will not endure&quot;, that men must oppose &quot;the devil with brave deeds&quot;, and that earthly wealth cannot travel to the afterlife nor can it benefit the soul after a man&#x27;s death.

In its closing verses, the poems makes a series of gnomic statements about God, eternity, and self-control; the poem then ends with the single word &quot;Amen&quot;.

==Structure==

Many scholars think of the seafarer&#x27;s narration of his experiences as an exemplum, used to make a moral point and to persuade his hearers of the truth of his words. It has been proposed that this poem demonstrates the fundamental Anglo-Saxon belief that life is shaped by fate. In &quot;The Search for Anglo-Saxon Paganism&quot; (1975), Eric Stanley pointed out that Henry Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Sketch of the History of Anglo-Saxon Poetry&quot; in W. C. Hazlitt&#x27;s edition of &quot;Warton&#x27;s History of English Poetry&quot; (1871), expresses a typical 19th century pre-occupation with &quot;fatalism&quot; in the Old English elegies. Another understanding was offered in the &quot;Cambridge Old English Reader&quot;, namely that the poem is essentially concerned to state: &quot;Let us (good Christians, that is) remind ourselves where our true home lies and concentrate on getting there&quot;

As early as 1902, W. W. Lawrence had concluded that the poem was a &quot;wholly secular poem revealing the mixed emotions of an adventurous seaman who could not but yield to the irresistible fascination for the sea in spite of his knowledge of its perils and hardships&quot;.

&quot;The Seafarer&quot; has attracted the attention of scholars and critics, creating a substantial amount of critical assessment. Many of these studies initially debated the continuity and unity of the poem. One early interpretation, also discussed by W. W. Lawrence, was that the poem could be thought of as a conversation between an old seafarer, weary of the ocean, and a young seafarer, excited to travel the high seas. This interpretation arose because of the arguably alternating nature of the emotions in the text.

Another argument, in &quot;&quot;The Seafarer&quot;: An Interpretation&quot; (1937), was proposed by O. S. Anderson, who plainly stated: He nevertheless also suggested that the poem can be split into three different parts, naming the first part A1, the second part A2, and the third part B, and conjectured that it was possible that the third part had been written by someone other than the author of the first two sections. The third part may give an impression of being more influenced by Christianity than the previous parts. However, he also stated that and added, to counter suggestions that there had been interpolations, that: &quot;personally I believe that [lines 103–124] are to be accepted as a genuine portion of the poem&quot;. Moreover, in &quot;&quot;The Seafarer&quot;; A Postscript&quot;, published in 1979, writing as O. S. Arngart, he simply divided the poem into two sections. The first section represents the poet&#x27;s life on earth, and the second tells us of his longing to voyage to a better world, to Heaven.

In most later assessments, scholars have agreed with Anderson/Arngart in arguing that the work is a well-unified monologue. In 1975, David Howlett published a textual analysis which suggested that both &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;The Seafarer&quot; are &quot;coherent poems with structures unimpaired by interpolators&quot;; and concluded that a variety of &quot;indications of rational thematic development and balanced structure imply that &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;The Seafarer&quot; have been transmitted from the pens of literate poets without serious corruption.&quot; With particular reference to &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, Howlett further added that &quot;The argument of the entire poem is compressed into&quot; lines 58–63, and explained that &quot;Ideas in the five lines which precede the centre&quot; (line 63) &quot;are reflected in the five lines which follow it&quot;. By 1982, Frederick S. Holton had amplified this finding by pointing out that &quot;it has long been recognized that &quot;The Seafarer&quot; is a unified whole and that it is possible to interpret the first sixty-three-and-a-half lines in a way that is consonant with, and leads up to, the moralizing conclusion&quot;.

== Themes ==

Scholars have focused on the poem in a variety of ways. In the arguments assuming the unity of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, scholars have debated the interpretation and translations of words, the intent and effect of the poem, whether the poem is allegorical, and, if so, the meaning of the supposed allegory.

=== Wisdom ===

Thomas D. Hill, in 1998, argues that the content of the poem also links it with the sapiential books, or wisdom literature, a category particularly used in biblical studies that mainly consists of proverbs and maxims. Hill argues that &quot;The Seafarer&quot; has &quot;significant sapiential material concerning the definition of wise men, the ages of the world, and the necessity for patience in adversity&quot;.

In his account of the poem in the &quot;Cambridge Old English Reader&quot;, published in 2004, Richard Marsden writes, &quot;It is an exhortatory and didactic poem, in which the miseries of winter seafaring are used as a metaphor for the challenge faced by the committed Christian&quot;. If this interpretation of the poem, as providing a metaphor for the challenges of life, can be generally agreed upon, then one may say that it is a contemplative poem that teaches Christians to be faithful and to maintain their beliefs.

=== Religion ===

Scholars have often commented on religion in the structure of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;. Critics who argue against structural unity specifically perceive newer religious interpolations to a secular poem.

Sweet&#x27;s &quot;An Anglo-Saxon Reader in Prose and Verse&quot; (1894) ends the poem at line 108, not 124. In &quot;Old English Poems&quot; (1918), Faust and Thompson note that before line 65, &quot;this is one of the finest specimens of Anglo-Saxon poetry&quot; but after line 65, &quot;a very tedious homily that must surely be a later addition&quot;. Their translation ends with &#x27;My soul unceasingly to sail o&#x27;er the whale-path / Over the waves of the sea&#x27;, with a note below &quot;at this point the dull homiletic passage begins. Much of it is quite untranslatable.&quot; A number of subsequent translators, and previous ones such as Pound in 1911, have based their interpretations of the poem on this belief, and this trend in early Old English studies to separate the poem into two parts—secular and religious—continues to affect scholarship.

Disagreeing with Pope and Whitelock&#x27;s view of the seafarer as a penitential exile, John F. Vickrey argues that if the Seafarer were a religious exile, then the speaker would have related the &quot;joys of the spirit&quot; and not his miseries to the reader. This reading has received further support from Sebastian Sobecki, who argues that Whitelock&#x27;s interpretation of religious pilgrimage does not conform to known pilgrimage patterns at the time. Instead, he proposes the vantage point of a fisherman. However, the text contains no mention, or indication of any sort, of fishes or fishing; and it is arguable that the composition is written from the vantage point of a fisher of men; that is, an evangelist. Douglas Williams suggested in 1989: &quot;I would like to suggest that another figure more completely fits its narrator: The Evangelist&quot;. Marsden points out that although at times this poem may seem depressing, there is a sense of hope throughout it, centered on eternal life in Heaven.

=== Literal view ===

Dorothy Whitelock claimed that the poem is a literal description of the voyages with no figurative meaning, concluding that the poem is about a literal penitential exile.

=== Allegorical view===

Pope believes the poem describes a journey not literally but through allegorical layers. Greenfield, however, believes that the seafarer&#x27;s first voyages are not the voluntary actions of a penitent but rather imposed by a confessor on the sinful seaman.

Daniel G. Calder argues that the poem is an allegory for the representation of the mind, where the elements of the voyages are objective symbols of an &quot;exilic&quot; state of mind. Contrasted to the setting of the sea is the setting of the land, a state of mind that contains former joys. When the sea and land are joined through the wintry symbols, Calder argues the speaker&#x27;s psychological mindset changes. He explains that is when &quot;something informs him that all life on earth is like death. The land the seafarer seeks on this new and outward ocean voyage is one that will not be subject to the mutability of the land and sea as he has known&quot;. John F. Vickrey continues Calder&#x27;s analysis of &quot;The Seafarer&quot; as a psychological allegory. Vickrey argued that the poem is an allegory for the life of a sinner through the metaphor of &quot;the boat of the mind,&quot; a metaphor used &quot;to describe, through the imagery of a ship at sea, a person&#x27;s state of mind&quot;.

== Language and Text ==
John C. Pope and Stanley Greenfield have specifically debated the meaning of the word (modern English: &#x27;self, very, own&#x27;), which appears in the first line of the poem. They also debate whether the seafarer&#x27;s earlier voyages were voluntary or involuntary.

=== and ===

In &quot;Medium &quot; (1957–1959), G. V. Smithers drew attention to the following points in connection with the word &#x27;, which occurs in line 62b of the poem: 1. The brings about the death of the person speaking. 2. It is characterized as eager and greedy. 3. It moves through the air. 4. It yells. As a result, Smithers concluded that it is therefore possible that the designates a valkyrie. Smithers also noted that &#x27; in line 63 can be translated as &quot;on the death road&quot;, if the original text is not emended to read , or &#x27;on the whale road [the sea]&#x27;. In the unique manuscript of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, the words are exceptionally clearly written . This may have some bearing on their interpretation. John R. Clark Hall, in the first edition of his Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (1894), translated as &#x27;fateful journey&#x27; and &#x27;way of slaughter&#x27;, although he changed these translations in subsequent editions. The &#x27;death-way&#x27; reading was adopted by C. W. M. Grein in 1857: ; by Henry Sweet in 1871: &#x27;on the path of death&#x27;, although he changed his mind in 1888; and A. D. Horgan in 1979: &#x27;upon destruction&#x27;s path&#x27;. Other translators have almost all favoured &#x27;whale road&#x27;. In &quot;A Short Dictionary of Anglo-Saxon Poetry&quot; (1960), J. B. Bessinger Jr provided two translations of &quot;&quot;: &#x27;attacking flier&#x27; (p. 3) and &#x27;solitary flier&#x27; (p. 4); &#x27;solitary flier&#x27; is used in most translations.

In the &#x27;, by Heinrich Leo, published by , Halle, Germany, in 1872, &#x27; is defined as an adjective, describing a person who is &#x27;defenceless, vulnerable, unwary, unguarded or unprepared&#x27;. This adjective appears in the dative case, indicating &quot;attendant circumstances&quot;, as , only twice in the entire corpus of Anglo-Saxon literature: in &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, line 63; and in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, line 741. In both cases, it can be reasonably understood in the meaning provided by Leo, who makes specific reference to &quot;The Seafarer&quot;. However, it has very frequently been translated as &#x27;irresistibly&#x27; or &#x27;without hindrance&#x27;.

=== List of translations ===
&quot;The Seafarer&quot; has been translated many times by numerous scholars, poets, and other writers, with the first English translation by Benjamin Thorpe in 1842. Between 1842 and 2000 over 60 different versions, in eight languages, have been recorded. The translations fall along a scale between scholarly and poetic, best described by John Dryden as noted in &quot;The Word Exchange&quot; anthology of Old English poetry: &#x27;metaphrase&#x27;, or a crib; &#x27;paraphrase&#x27;, or &#x27;translation with latitude&#x27;, allowing the translator to keep the original author in view while altering words, but not sense; and &#x27;imitation&#x27;, which &#x27;departs from words and sense, sometimes writing as the author would have done had she lived in the time and place of the reader&#x27;.

== Creative adaptations and interpretations ==

=== Ezra Pound, 1911 ===
American expatriate poet Ezra Pound produced a well-known interpretation of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, and his version varies from the original in theme and content. It all but eliminates the religious element of the poem, and addresses only the first 99 lines. However, Pound mimics the style of the original through the extensive use of alliteration, which is a common device in Anglo-Saxon poetry. His interpretation was first published in &quot;The New Age&quot; on November 30, 1911, in a column titled &#x27;I Gather the Limbs of Osiris&#x27;, and in his &quot;Ripostes&quot; in 1912. J. B. Bessinger Jr noted that Pound&#x27;s poem &#x27;has survived on merits that have little to do with those of an accurate translation&#x27;. Pound&#x27;s version was reprinted in the &quot;Norton Anthology of Poetry&quot; (2005).

=== Jila Peacock, 1999 ===
Painter and printmaker Jila Peacock created a series of monoprints in response to the poem in 1999. She went on to collaborate with composer Sally Beamish to produce the multi-media project &#x27;The Seafarer Piano trio&#x27;, which premiered at the Alderton Arts festival in 2002. Her prints have subsequently been brought together with a translation of the poem by Amy Kate Riach, published by Sylph Editions in 2010.

=== Sally Beamish, 2001 ===
Composer Sally Beamish has written several works inspired by &quot;The Seafarer&quot; since 2001. Her &quot;Viola Concerto no. 2&quot; was jointly commissioned by the Swedish and Scottish Chamber Orchestras, and first performed by Tabea Zimmermann with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, at the City Halls, Glasgow, in January 2002. Another piece, &quot;The Seafarer Trio&quot; was recorded and released in 2014 by Orchid Classics.

=== Sylph Editions with Amy Kate Riach and Jila Peacock, 2010 ===
Independent publishers Sylph Editions have released two versions of &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, with a translation by Amy Kate Riach and Jila Peacock&#x27;s monoprints. A large format book was released in 2010 with a smaller edition in 2014.

=== Caroline Bergvall, 2014 ===
Caroline Bergvall&#x27;s multi-media work &#x27;Drift&#x27; was commissioned as a live performance in 2012 by Grü/Transtheatre, Geneva, performed at the 2013 Shorelines Literature Festival, Southend-on-sea, UK, and produced as video, voice, and music performances by Penned in the Margins across the UK in 2014. &#x27;Drift&#x27; was published as text and prints by Nightboat Books (2014). &#x27;Drift&#x27; reinterprets the themes and language of &#x27;The Seafarer&#x27; to reimagine stories of refugees crossing the Mediterranean sea, and, according to a review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; of May 2014, &#x27;toys with the ancient and unfamiliar English&#x27;.

<text>Omer Faruk Tekbilek (, born 1951) is a Turkish musician and composer, who plays a wide range of wind, string, percussion and electronic instruments. He has developed a style that builds on traditional Sufi music, but includes inspiration from ambient electronic musicians, most notably Brian Keane. He is best known for his performances with the flute-like ney, but also plays the piccolo-like kaval, and the double-reed zurna. Among stringed instruments, he plays the oud and the bağlama.

==Projects with other musicians==
In August 2011 the album &quot;Rock the Tabla&quot; was released featuring Omer Faruk Tekbilek, A. R. Rahman, Hossam Ramzy, Billy Cobham &amp; Manu Katché.

<doc id="956947" wikidata="Q121647" url="?curid=956947" title="Paul Pierce">
<text>Paul Anthony Pierce (born October 13, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player. He played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), predominantly with the Boston Celtics. As of September 2024, he is a contributor to the FS1 sports talk show &quot;Speak&quot;.

Pierce was a high school McDonald&#x27;s All-American and earned consensus first-team All-America honors in his junior year at Kansas. After being chosen by the Boston Celtics with the 10th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, Pierce spent the first 15 years of his career with Boston. Pierce&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Truth,&quot; was given to him by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in 2001. He starred as captain of the Celtics, earning 10 All-Star selections and becoming a four-time All-NBA team member. Pierce combined with Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007 to form a &quot;Big Three&quot; that led Boston to two NBA Finals and an NBA championship in 2008. Pierce was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player in 2008. In 2021, Pierce was honored by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Along with Larry Bird and John Havlicek, Pierce is one of only three players to have scored more than 20,000 career points with the Celtics.

In July 2013, Pierce was traded to the Brooklyn Nets along with teammates Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry. He signed with the Washington Wizards as a free agent in 2014. After one season with the Wizards, Pierce signed with the Los Angeles Clippers, reuniting him with former Celtics head coach Doc Rivers. He spent two seasons with the Clippers before retiring in 2017. On July 17, 2017, the Celtics signed Pierce to a contract, enabling him to retire as a member of the organization with which he spent his first 15 NBA seasons.

==Early life==
Pierce was born in Oakland, California. His family later moved to Inglewood, California, where he attended Inglewood High School. He was cut from Inglewood High&#x27;s varsity basketball team during his freshman and sophomore years and seriously thought about transferring before spending extra time in the gym and becoming the &quot;best player on the team&quot; by the end of his junior year. In his senior year, he averaged 27 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists per game. Pierce went on to participate in the 1995 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game alongside future NBA stars Kevin Garnett, Vince Carter, Stephon Marbury, and Antawn Jamison, and was a contestant in the game&#x27;s Slam Dunk Contest, which was won by Carter. He grew up a Los Angeles Lakers fan and dreamed of playing for the team.

In 2012, Pierce was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans.

==College career==
Pierce spent three years at Kansas between 1995 and 1998. He earned honorable mention All-Big Eight honors and was selected second team Freshman All-American by Basketball Weekly. He was also honored as the Big Eight Co-Freshman of the Year with Colorado&#x27;s Chauncey Billups. During the summer of 1996, Pierce earned a spot on the roster of the USA&#x27;s Under 22 team and helped the United States go undefeated in the World Championship-qualifying tournament in Puerto Rico. As a sophomore, Pierce captured the first of two Big 12 Conference tournament Most Valuable Player awards after averaging 21.7 points and guiding Kansas to the inaugural tournament championship.

As a junior in 1997–98, Pierce won Most Valuable Player honors in both the Preseason NIT and the Big 12 Conference tournament. He was selected First Team All-Big 12 Conference by both the AP and Coaches, and was named Associated Press First Team All-American and a finalist for the 1998 John Wooden and Naismith awards. He scored 777 points as a junior—the fifth-most single-season point total in Jayhawks history. He ranks as the fifth-leading scorer in Kansas history (1,786 points) and 11th on the all-time rebounds list (676).

Pierce left the University of Kansas following his junior season and entered the 1998 NBA draft.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics (1998–2013)===
==== Early years and breakthrough (1998–2001) ====
Pierce was selected with the 10th overall pick in 1998 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, a team he &quot;despised&quot; growing up. He scored 19 or more points in 10 of his first 11 contests. For that year, he averaged 16.5 points and finished third in the voting for Rookie of the Year honors. In his second season, he raised his scoring average to 19.5 points per game. In the 2000–01 season, Pierce appeared in 82 games (all starts), averaging 25.3 points, 6.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.68 steals in 38.0 minutes. He led the Celtics and finished eighth in the league in points per game and fourth in total points (2,071). He was named NBA Player of the Month for March 2001 after averaging 30.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.60 steals for the month.

==== First All-Star and playoff appearances (2001–2007) ====
In the 2001–02 season, Pierce was named Eastern Conference Co-Player of the Month twice, for December and April. That season, Pierce led the Celtics to the playoffs for the first time in seven years and on to the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 3 of the conference finals, the Celtics pulled off the largest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA playoff history, with Pierce scoring 19 of his 28 points in the final 12 minutes as Boston overcame a 21-point deficit to beat the New Jersey Nets 94–90. The win gave the Celtics a 2–1 advantage in the series; however, the Nets went on to win the series in six games.

From 2002 to 2006, Pierce made the All-Star team every season. He led the league in total points (2,144) in 2002 and was an All-NBA Third Team selection in 2002 and 2003.

==== NBA champion and Finals MVP (2007–2008) ====
Prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics acquired the services of fellow NBA All-Stars Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. The pair combined with Pierce to form a &quot;Big Three&quot;. The Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history, with the &quot;Big Three&quot; leading Boston to 66 wins in the regular season, a 42-game improvement. However, the team struggled initially in the playoffs. The Atlanta Hawks took them to seven games in the first round, as did the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. In Game 7 of their series against the Cavaliers, Pierce racked up the second most Game 7 points in franchise history with 41 as the Celtics edged the Cavaliers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics went on to defeat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.
On June 5, 2008, in Game 1 of the 2008 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, Pierce was injured in the third quarter and was carried off the court appearing to be in serious pain. However, he came back to the court only a few minutes later to spark the Celtics with 15 points in the third quarter en route to a 98–88 victory. He went on to lead the Celtics to their 17th championship with a 4–2 series victory over the Lakers. Pierce was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player after averaging 22 points per game over the six-game series.

==== Coming up short (2008–2012) ====

Pierce and the Celtics looked to repeat as world champions during the 2008–09 NBA season. Pierce missed only one game the entire season and led the team in scoring. He was named to the 2009 NBA All-Star Game and for the first time to the All-NBA Second Team. Despite Pierce&#x27;s success, with Kevin Garnett injured, the Celtics lost in the second round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs.

At the 2010 NBA All-Star Game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Pierce became the first Celtic since Larry Bird to win the Three-Point Contest.

In Game 3 of the first round between the Celtics and Miami Heat in the 2010 NBA Playoffs, Pierce hit a 21-foot jumper at the buzzer to beat Miami 100–98 and give the Celtics a 3–0 series lead. The Celtics went on to win that series, and also defeated the heavily favored Cavaliers in the second round. They faced the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals and beat them in 6 games to advance to their second Finals appearance in the Big 3 era. They faced off against the Lakers in a rematch of the 2008 NBA Finals and took a 3–2 lead heading back to Los Angeles. However, in spite of Rasheed Wallace more than making up for the loss of injured center Kendrick Perkins, the Celtics were blown out in Game 6 and lost a 13-point second-half lead in Game 7, losing the deciding game 83–79.

On June 29, 2010, Pierce opted out of his contract and invoked his early termination clause to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1, 2010. However, on July 2, Pierce and the Celtics verbally agreed to a four-year extension keeping him in Boston through the 2013–14 season.

On November 3, 2010, during a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, Pierce scored his 20,000th career point on a free throw, becoming the third player in Celtics history to reach that milestone solely in a Celtics uniform. The Celtics finished the season with the number 3 seed in the Eastern Conference and swept the New York Knicks in the first round of the playoffs. In the second round, the Celtics took on the Miami Heat and their big three of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh. The Celtics lost to Miami, who eventually moved on to the NBA Finals, in five games.

On February 7, 2012, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Pierce scored 15 points to pass Larry Bird for second place on the Boston Celtics&#x27; all-time scoring list. He was named to his tenth NBA All-Star appearance on February 9, 2012. He then played his 1,000th career game with the Celtics on March 9, 2012, against the Portland Trail Blazers; only Pierce, John Havlicek, and Robert Parish have played in over 1,000 career games for the Celtics. For the 2011–12 season, Pierce averaged 19.4 points, 4.5 assists, and 5.2 rebounds per game as the Celtics finished the season 39–27 during the shortened lockout season.

In the playoffs, the Celtics beat the Hawks in six games in the first round, as Pierce averaged 21.2 points per game during the series. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins. They pushed the Celtics into a full seven-game series, but the Celtics won the final game 85–75. The Celtics then played the Miami Heat in the conference finals. Pierce hit a crucial 3-pointer over LeBron James in game 5 to take a series lead of 3–2, but the Celtics lost the last two games, and the Heat advanced to the NBA Finals. Pierce finished the playoffs averaging 18.9 points per game while shooting only 38.6 percent from the field and 31 percent from three.

==== Final season in Boston (2012–2013) ====

The 2012–13 season did not go as planned for the Celtics, with All-Star point guard Rajon Rondo out with a torn ACL injury. On January 27, 2013, against the Miami Heat, Pierce recorded his first triple-double of the season with 17 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 assists. On February 10, 2013, against the Denver Nuggets, Pierce recorded his second triple-double of the season with 27 points, 14 rebounds, and 14 assists becoming the oldest player, in a game of any length, to record at least 20 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists (previously held by Larry Bird). On March 29, 2013, against the Atlanta Hawks, Pierce recorded his third triple-double of the season with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Pierce finished the 2012–13 season with season averages of 18.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 4.8 assists per game while the Celtics managed to clinch the 7th seed in the playoffs with a 41–40 season record (with one game not played because of the Boston Marathon bombing). The Celtics lost to the New York Knicks in the 1st round in six games. Pierce averaged 19.2 points per game while shooting a poor 36.8 percent from the field and 26.8 percent from three-point range along with 5.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists in the playoff series loss.

===Brooklyn Nets (2013–2014)===

On June 28, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts and Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks, and Keith Bogans. The deal was completed on July 12, 2013. Brooklyn also received D. J. White and the Celtics also received the right to swap first-round picks in the 2017 draft. Pierce convinced Garnett to waive his no-trade clause so that the deal could come to fruition. At an introductory press conference with Garnett and Terry following the trade, Pierce stated, &quot;We are championship driven... We made a lot of money in our careers. We have won a number of awards. At this point right now, we are about winning a championship. Brooklyn gives us the best opportunity.&quot;

In 2013–14, Pierce appeared in 75 games (including 68 starts), averaging 13.5 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 28.0 minutes. He scored 1,000 points for the 15th straight season, becoming the only active NBA player and the sixth player in NBA history (along with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, John Havlicek, Elvin Hayes, Robert Parish) to score 1,000 points in 15 straight seasons. He passed Allen Iverson and Patrick Ewing on the NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring list (moving up to 18th in NBA history), moved into fifth place in all-time NBA history with 1,935 career three-pointers made, and had his most steals (86) in a season since 2007–08. On April 11, 2014, against Atlanta, Pierce became the fourth active player (along with Kobe Bryant, Dirk Nowitzki and Garnett) and the 18th player in NBA history to score 25,000 career points.

Prior to the season, the Nets were thought to be contenders to win the Eastern Conference. Pierce and Garnett were set to be the supporting cast to Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Brook Lopez. After scraping past the Toronto Raptors in the first round of the playoffs thanks to a last-second block from Pierce in Game 7, their attempt to get past the Heat and win a championship fell short. They lost to Miami in five games in the second round.

===Washington Wizards (2014–2015)===

On July 17, 2014, Pierce signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Washington Wizards. With 14 points against the Atlanta Hawks on November 25, 2014, Pierce passed Jerry West for 17th place on the NBA&#x27;s career scoring list. Two weeks later, Pierce passed Reggie Miller for 16th place on the NBA&#x27;s career scoring list with a season-high 28 points against the Boston Celtics. On January 14, 2015, Pierce passed Jason Kidd for fourth all-time in three-pointers made in a 105–99 win over the Chicago Bulls. Eleven days later, he recorded his 2,000th career three-pointer in a 117–115 overtime win over the Denver Nuggets. On February 2, 2015, he passed Alex English for 15th place on the NBA&#x27;s career scoring list with 11 points against the Charlotte Hornets. Pierce finished the regular season averaging 11.9 points per game, a career low.

On May 9, 2015, Pierce made a two-point shot with three defenders on him at the buzzer to defeat the Atlanta Hawks 103–101 and take a 2–1 series lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. He finished the game with 13 points and 7 rebounds. In Game 6 of the series on May 15, the Wizards were down 94–91 with seconds remaining when Pierce launched a three-pointer, hoping to extend the Wizards&#x27; season by forcing overtime. The shot swished, apparently tying the score at the buzzer, but the play was reviewed, showing the clock expired before Pierce released the basketball.

On June 27, 2015, Pierce opted out of the second year of his contract with the Wizards to become a free agent.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2015–2017)===
On July 10, 2015, Pierce signed a three-year, $10 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. He made his debut for the Clippers in the team&#x27;s season opener against the Sacramento Kings on October 28, recording 12 points and 7 rebounds off the bench in a 111–104 win. With Lance Stephenson starting at small forward, Pierce began the season as a role player off the bench for the first time in his career. On December 16, Pierce scored six points against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the game, he hit a buzzer-beater to end the first quarter and became the fifth active player and 16th in NBA history to reach 26,000 points.

On September 26, 2016, Pierce announced that the 2016–17 season would be his last in the NBA. In what would be his last game in Boston, on February 5, 2017, Pierce started and played the first five minutes before heading to the bench—it was his first appearance for the Clippers since New Year&#x27;s Eve. Although the crowd chanted his name in the final minutes, Pierce did not re-enter the game until there was 19 seconds left; he hit a three-pointer to finish the game for his only points of the contest. On April 10, 2017, he scored all of his 10 points in the final five minutes of the Clippers&#x27; 125–96 win over the Houston Rockets. He subsequently moved into 15th on the NBA career scoring list with 26,397 points. The Clippers finished the regular season with a 51–31 record and entered the playoffs as the No. 4 seed. They went on to lose their first-round playoff series to the Utah Jazz in seven games, as Pierce&#x27;s 19-year NBA career came to an end at the final buzzer of Game 7 on April 30, 2017. In his final game, he had six points and three rebounds in 21 minutes and averaged 11.1 minutes in the series. On June 28, 2017, he was waived by the Clippers.

=== Retirement ===
On July 17, 2017, Pierce signed a ceremonial contract with the Boston Celtics in order to retire with the team. On August 18, 2017, the Celtics announced Pierce&#x27;s jersey would be retired on February 11, 2018. His jersey was raised to the rafters of TD Garden in a postgame ceremony following the Celtics-Cavaliers game, becoming the 23rd person in Celtics history to be honored.

In 2021, Pierce was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

==International career==
Pierce was a member of the United States national team for the 2002 FIBA World Championship, starting all nine games and averaging 19.8 points per game. Pierce was also selected for the United States national team for the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but did not compete because of minor off-season surgery.

== Broadcasting career ==
===ESPN===
In August 2017, Pierce joined ESPN as a studio analyst for &quot;The Jump&quot; and &quot;NBA Countdown&quot;, after appearing as a guest analyst during the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals for &quot;NBA Countdown&quot;. His role at the network was reduced in 2019 due to questions about his preparation for NBA segments and game predictions.

Pierce was fired by ESPN after streaming from his Instagram Live on April 2, 2021. During the livestream at a poker game, he featured several women wearing bikinis who were massaging his shoulders or twerking. Pierce also showcased himself drinking alcohol from a small cup and smoking a blunt while responding to fan messages. ESPN ended its relationship with Pierce on April 5, 2021, and had no further comment on the firing. Pierce later responded to news of his firing with a Twitter video of him laughing while also tweeting that &quot;Big things are coming soon&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t lose even when I lose, I&#x27;m winning.&quot;

===Fox Sports 1===
In March 2024, Pierce joined FS1 as a basketball analyst in a contributor role for the sports talk show &quot;Undisputed&quot;, hosted by commentator Skip Bayless.

Following the departure of Skip Bayless and the discontinuation of &quot;Undisputed&quot; in August 2024, Pierce moved to the sports talk show &quot;Speak&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pierce and his ex-wife Julie (née Landrum) have three children; two daughters, Prianna and Adrian, and a son, Prince.

Paul has two half brothers, Jamal and Steve Hosey. Steve was a first round draft selection and reached the MLB ranks with the San Francisco Giants. Jamal played college basketball for Wyoming.

===Stabbing incident===
On September 25, 2000, Pierce was stabbed 11 times in the face, neck, and back and had a bottle smashed over his head while at the Buzz Club, a late-night dance club in the Boston Theater District. He had to undergo lung surgery to repair the damage; nevertheless, Pierce was the only Celtics player to start all 82 games in the 2000–01 season. Tony Battie, Pierce&#x27;s teammate at the time, along with Battie&#x27;s brother, saved him by rushing him to a nearby hospital. In 2003, two and a half years after the attack, Pierce pledged $2.5 million to help expand the high-tech surgical center at Tufts-New England Medical Center that helped make his recovery possible. Pierce stated, &quot;This is an opportunity for me to give back to the hospital that was there for me when I needed it.&quot;

In August 2018, Pierce discussed battling depression for a year after his stabbing, revealing that he dealt with paranoia over crowds and post-traumatic stress stemming from the incident. He divulged this information as part of the NBA&#x27;s initiative to focus on the mental health of its players.

===Nickname===
Pierce&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the Truth&quot;, was bestowed on him by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal after a 112–107 Los Angeles Lakers victory over the Celtics on March 13, 2001, in which Pierce scored 42 points on 13-of-19 shooting. O&#x27;Neal pulled &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reporter Steve Bulpett over and gestured toward his notepad. &quot;Take this down,&quot; said O&#x27;Neal. &quot;My name is Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Paul Pierce is the motherfucking truth. Quote me on that and don&#x27;t take nothing out. I knew he could play, but I didn&#x27;t know he could play like this. Paul Pierce is The Truth.&quot;

===2022 EthereumMax lawsuit===
In January 2022, in a class-action lawsuit filed against the cryptocurrency company EthereumMax that alleged the company is a pump and dump scheme, Pierce was named as a defendant along with media personality Kim Kardashian, former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., and other celebrities for promoting the EthereumMax token on their social media accounts. In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media. In December 2022, Central California U.S. District Court Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the lawsuit on the basis that the claims were insufficiently supported given heightened pleading standards for fraud.

=== Television ===
On the March 19, 2024, episode of Extended Family, entitled &quot;The Consequences of Being Irish,&quot; Pierce played himself at a fictional Boston Celtics fundraising event.

<doc id="956960" wikidata="Q464200" url="?curid=956960" title="History of Buddhism">
<text>The history of Buddhism can be traced back to the 5th century BCE. Buddhism originated from Ancient India, in and around the ancient Kingdom of Magadha, and is based on the teachings of the renunciate Siddhārtha Gautama. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent throughout Central, East, and Southeast Asia. At one time or another, it influenced most of Asia.

The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and philosophical schools. Among them were the Theravāda, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.

==Shakyamuni Buddha (5th cent. BCE)==


Siddhārtha Gautama (5th cent. BCE) was the historical founder of Buddhism. The early sources state he was born in the small Shakya (Pali: Sakya) Republic, which was part of the Kosala realm of ancient India, now in modern-day Nepal. He is thus also known as the &quot;Shakyamuni&quot; (literally: &quot;The sage of the Shakya clan&quot;).

The Early Buddhist Texts contain no continuous life of the buddha, only later after 200 BCE where various &quot;biographies&quot; with much mythological embellishment written. All texts agree however that Gautama renounced the householder life and lived as a sramana ascetic for some time studying under various teachers, before attaining nirvana (extinguishment) and bodhi (awakening) through meditation.

For the remaining 45 years of his life, he travelled the Gangetic Plains of eastern-central India (the region of the Ganges River and its tributaries), teaching his doctrine to a diverse range of people from different castes and initiating monks into his order. The Buddha sent his disciples to spread the teaching across India. He also initiated an order of nuns. He urged his disciples to teach in the local language or dialects. He spent a lot of his time near the cities of Sāvatthī, Rājagaha and Vesālī (Skt. Śrāvastī, Rājagrha, Vāiśalī). By the time of his death at 80, he had thousands of followers.

==Early Buddhism==
After the death of the Buddha, the Buddhist sangha (monastic community) remained centered on the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record various councils, where the monastic Sangha recited and organised the orally transmitted collections of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community. Modern scholarship has questioned the accuracy and historicity of these traditional accounts.

The first Buddhist council is traditionally said to have been held just after Buddha&#x27;s Parinirvana, and presided over by Mahākāśyapa, one of his most senior disciples, at Rājagṛha (today&#x27;s Rajgir) with the support of king Ajātasattu. According to Charles Prebish, almost all scholars have questioned the historicity of this first council.

==Mauryan empire (322–180 BCE)==

===Second Buddhist council and first schism===
After an initial period of unity, divisions in the sangha or monastic community led to the first schism of the sangha into two groups: the Sthavira (Elders) and Mahasamghika (Great Sangha). Most scholars agree that the schism was caused by disagreements over points of vinaya (monastic discipline). Over time, these two monastic fraternities would further divide into various Early Buddhist Schools.

Lamotte and Hirakawa both maintain that the first schism in the Buddhist sangha occurred during the reign of Ashoka. According to scholar Collett Cox &quot;most scholars would agree that even though the roots of the earliest recognized groups predate Aśoka, their actual separation did not occur until after his death.&quot; According to the Theravada tradition, the split took place at the Second Buddhist council, which took place at Vaishali, approximately one hundred years after Gautama Buddha&#x27;s parinirvāṇa. While the second council probably was a historical event, traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous. According to the Theravada tradition the overall result was the first schism in the sangha, between the Sthavira nikāya and the Mahāsāṃghikas, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was.

The Sthaviras gave birth to a large number of influential schools including the Sarvāstivāda, the Pudgalavāda (also known as &quot;Vatsīputrīya&quot;), the Dharmaguptakas and the Vibhajyavāda (the Theravādins being descended from these. The Mahasamghikas meanwhile also developed their own schools and doctrines early on, which can be seen in texts like the Mahavastu, associated with the Lokottaravāda, or ‘Transcendentalist’ school, who might be the same as the Ekavyāvahārikas or &quot;One-utterancers&quot;. This school has been seen as foreshadowing certain Mahayana ideas, especially due to their view that all of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s acts were &quot;transcendental&quot; or &quot;supramundane&quot;, even those performed before his Buddhahood.

In the third century BCE, some Buddhists began introducing new systematized teachings called Abhidharma, based on previous lists or tables (&quot;Matrka&quot;) of main doctrinal topics. Unlike the Nikayas, which were prose sutras or discourses, the Abhidharma literature consisted of systematic doctrinal exposition and often differed across the Buddhist schools who disagreed on points of doctrine. Abhidharma sought to analyze all experience into its ultimate constituents, phenomenal events or processes called &quot;dharmas&quot;. These texts further contributed to the development of sectarian identities. The various splits within the monastic organization went together with the introduction and emphasis on Abhidhammic literature by some schools. This literature was specific to each school, and arguments and disputes between the schools were often based on these Abhidhammic writings. However, actual splits were originally based on disagreements on vinaya (monastic discipline), though later on, by about 100 CE or earlier, they could be based on doctrinal disagreement. Pre-sectarian Buddhism, however, did not have Abhidhammic scriptures, except perhaps for a basic framework, and not all of the early schools developed an Abhidhamma literature.

===Ashokan missions===
During the reign of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (268–232 BCE), Buddhism gained royal support and began to spread more widely, reaching most of the Indian subcontinent. After his invasion of Kalinga, Ashoka seems to have experienced remorse and began working to improve the lives of his subjects. Ashoka also built wells, rest-houses and hospitals for humans and animals. He also abolished torture, royal hunting trips and perhaps even the death penalty. Ashoka also supported non-Buddhist faiths like Jainism and Brahmanism. Ashoka propagated religion by building stupas and pillars urging, among other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the Dharma. He has been hailed by Buddhist sources as the model for the compassionate chakravartin (wheel turning monarch).

Another feature of Mauryan Buddhism was the worship and veneration of stupas, large mounds which contained relics (Pali: &quot;sarīra&quot;) of the Buddha or other saints within. It was believed that the practice of devotion to these relics and stupas could bring blessings. Perhaps the best-preserved example of a Mauryan Buddhist site is the Great Stupa of Sanchi (dating from the 3rd century BCE).

According to the plates and pillars left by Aśoka (known as the Edicts of Ashoka), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far south as Sri Lanka and as far west as the Greek kingdoms, in particular the neighboring Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.

===Third council===
Theravadin sources state that Ashoka convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BCE at Pataliputra (today&#x27;s Patna) with the elder Moggaliputtatissa. The objective of the council was to purify the Saṅgha, particularly from non-Buddhist ascetics who had been attracted by the royal patronage. Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world, as is recorded in some of the edicts of Ashoka.

=== Proselytism in the Hellenistic world ===

Some of the Edicts of Ashoka describe the efforts made by him to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted cultural continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist proselytism: Antiochus II Theos of the Seleucid Kingdom (261–246 BCE), Ptolemy II Philadelphos of Egypt (285–247 BCE), Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia (276–239 BCE), Magas (288–258 BCE) in Cyrenaica (modern Libya), and Alexander II (272–255 BCE) in Epirus (modern Northwestern Greece). One of the edicts states:

:&quot;The conquest by Dharma has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred yojanas (5,400–9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the Cholas, the Pandyas, and as far as Tamraparni (Sri Lanka).&quot; (Edicts of Aśoka, 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).

Furthermore, according to the Mahavamsa (XII), some of Ashoka&#x27;s emissaries were Greek (Yona), particularly one named Dhammarakkhita. He also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of &quot;piety&quot; (using the Greek term &quot;eusebeia&quot; for Dharma) to the Greek community.

It is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but authors like Robert Linssen have commented that Buddhism may have influenced Western thought and religion at that time. Linssen points to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in Alexandria (mentioned by Clement of Alexandria), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the Therapeutae (possibly a deformation of the Pāli word &quot;Theravāda&quot;), who may have &quot;almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism&quot; and may even have been descendants of Aśoka&#x27;s emissaries to the West. Philosophers like Hegesias of Cyrene and Pyrrho are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.

Buddhist gravestones from the Ptolemaic period have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel. The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria has even drawn the conclusion that they influenced monastic Christianity. In the 2nd century CE, the Christian dogmatist, Clement of Alexandria recognized Bactrian &quot;śramanas&quot; and Indian &quot;gymnosophists&quot; for their influence on Greek thought.

===Establishment of Sri Lanka Buddhism===
Sri Lankan chronicles like the &quot;Dipavamsa&quot; state that Ashoka&#x27;s son Mahinda brought Buddhism to the island during the 2nd century BCE. In addition, Ashoka&#x27;s daughter, Saṅghamitta also established the bhikkhunī (order for nuns) in Sri Lanka, also bringing with her a sapling of the sacred bodhi tree that was subsequently planted in Anuradhapura. These two figures are seen as the mythical founders of the Sri Lankan Theravada. They are said to have converted the King Devanampiya Tissa (307–267 BCE) and many of the nobility.

The first architectural records of Buddha images, however, actually come from the reign of King Vasabha (65–109 CE). The major Buddhist monasteries and schools in Ancient Sri Lanka were Mahāvihāra, Abhayagiri and Jetavana. The Pāli canon was written down during the 1st century BCE to preserve the teaching in a time of war and famine. It is the only complete collection of Buddhist texts to survive in a Middle Indo-Aryan language. It reflects the tradition of the Mahavihara school. Later Pali Mahavihara commentators of the Theravada such as Buddhaghoṣa (4th–5th century) and Dhammapāla (5th–6th century), systematized the traditional Sri Lankan commentary literature (Atthakatha).

Although Mahāyāna Buddhism gained some influence in Sri Lanka as it was studied in Abhayagiri and Jetavana, the Mahavihara (“Great Monastery”) school became dominant in Sri Lanka following the reign of Parakramabahu I (1153–1186), who abolished the Abhayagiri and Jetavanin traditions.

==Mahāyāna Buddhism==
The Buddhist movement that became known as Mahayana (Great Vehicle) and also the Bodhisattvayana, began sometime between 150 BCE and 100 CE, drawing on both Mahasamghika and Sarvastivada trends. The earliest inscription which is recognizably Mahayana dates from 180 CE and is found in Mathura.

The Mahayana emphasized the Bodhisattva path to full Buddhahood (in contrast to the spiritual goal of arhatship). It emerged as a set of loose groups associated with new texts named the Mahayana sutras. The Mahayana sutras promoted new doctrines, such as the idea that &quot;there exist other Buddhas who are simultaneously preaching in countless other world-systems&quot;. In time Mahayana Bodhisattvas and also multiple Buddhas came to be seen as transcendental beneficent beings who were subjects of devotion.

Mahayana remained a minority among Indian Buddhists for some time, growing slowly until about half of all monks encountered by Xuanzang in 7th-century India were Mahayanists. Early Mahayana schools of thought included the Mādhyamaka, Yogācāra, and Buddha-nature (&quot;Tathāgatagarbha&quot;) teachings. Mahayana is today the dominant form of Buddhism in East Asia and Tibet.

Several scholars have suggested that the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, which are among the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras, developed among the Mahāsāṃghika along the Kṛṣṇa River in the Āndhra region of South India. The earliest Mahāyāna sūtras to include the very first versions of the Prajñāpāramitā genre, along with texts concerning Akṣobhya Buddha, which were probably written down in the 1st century BCE in the south of India. A.K. Warder believes that &quot;the Mahāyāna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the Āndhra country.&quot; Anthony Barber and Sree Padma also trace Mahayana Buddhism to ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Kṛṣṇa Valley, including Amaravati Stupa, Nāgārjunakoṇḍā and Jaggayyapeṭa.

==Shunga dynasty (2nd–1st century BCE)==
The Shunga dynasty (185–73 BCE) was established about 50 years after Ashoka&#x27;s death. After assassinating King Brhadrata (last of the Mauryan rulers), military commander-in-chief Pushyamitra Shunga took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the Aśokāvadāna allege that Pushyamitra (an orthodox Brahmin) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he &quot;destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks&quot;: 840,000 Buddhist stupas which had been built by Ashoka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.

Modern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following Ashoka&#x27;s sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Shungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted. Etienne Lamotte observes: &quot;To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof.&quot;

Another eminent historian, Romila Thapar points to archaeological evidence that &quot;suggests the contrary&quot; to the claim that &quot;Pushyamitra was a fanatical anti-Buddhist&quot; and that he &quot;never actually destroyed 840,000 stupas as claimed by Buddhist works, if any&quot;. Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pushyamitra&#x27;s attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Shungas.

During the period, Buddhist monks deserted the Ganges valley, following either the northern road (&quot;uttarapatha&quot;) or the southern road (&quot;dakṣinapatha&quot;). Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old Magadha area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of Gandhāra and Mathura or in the southeast around Amaravati Stupa. Some artistic activity also occurred in central India, as in Bhārhut, to which the Shungas may or may not have contributed.

==Greco-Buddhism==


The Greco-Bactrian king Demetrius I (reigned c. 200–180 BCE) invaded the Indian Subcontinent, establishing an Indo-Greek kingdom that was to last in parts of Northwest South Asia until the end of the 1st century CE.

Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek and Greco-Bactrian kings. One of the most famous Indo-Greek kings is Menander (reigned c. 160–135 BCE). He may have converted to Buddhism and is presented in the Mahāyāna tradition as one of the great benefactors of the faith, on a par with king Aśoka or the later Kushan king Kaniśka. Menander&#x27;s coins bear designs of the eight-spoked dharma wheel, a classic Buddhist symbol.

Direct cultural exchange is also suggested by a dialogue called the Debate of King Milinda (&quot;Milinda Pañha&quot;) which recounts a discussion between Menander and the Buddhist monk Nāgasena, who was himself a student of the Greek Buddhist monk Mahadharmaraksita. Upon Menander&#x27;s death, the honor of sharing his remains was claimed by the cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in stupas, in a parallel with the historic Buddha. Several of Menander&#x27;s Indo-Greek successors inscribed &quot;Follower of the Dharma,&quot; in the Kharoṣṭhī script, on their coins.

During the first century BCE the first anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha are found in the lands ruled by the Indo-Greeks, in a realistic style known as Greco-Buddhist. Many of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: the Greco-Roman toga-like wavy robe covering both shoulders (more exactly, its lighter version, the Greek &quot;himation&quot;), the contrapposto stance of the upright figures (see: 1st–2nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas), the stylicized Mediterranean curly hair and topknot (ushnisha) apparently derived from the style of the Belvedere Apollo (330 BCE), and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic realism (See: Greek art). A large quantity of sculptures combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and iconography were excavated at the Gandharan site of Hadda.

Several influential Greek Buddhist monks are recorded. Mahadharmaraksita (literally translated as &#x27;Great Teacher/Preserver of the Dharma&#x27;), was &quot;a Greek (&quot;Yona&quot;) Buddhist head monk&quot;, according to the Mahavamsa (Chap. XXIX), who led 30,000 Buddhist monks from &quot;the Greek city of Alasandra&quot; (Alexandria of the Caucasus, around 150 km north of today&#x27;s Kabul in Afghanistan), to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the Great Stupa in Anuradhapura during the rule (165–135 BCE) of King Menander I. Dhammarakkhita (meaning: &quot;Protected by the Dharma&quot;), was one of the missionaries sent by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka to proselytize the Buddhist faith. He is described as being a Greek (Pali: &quot;Yona&quot;, lit. &quot;Ionian&quot;) in the Sri Lankan &quot;Mahavamsa.&quot;

==Kushan empire and Gandharan Buddhism==
The Kushan empire (30–375 CE) was formed by the invading Yuezhi nomads in the 1st century BCE. It eventually encompassed much of northern India, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Kushans adopted elements of the Hellenistic culture of Bactria and the Indo-Greeks. During Kushan rule, Gandharan Buddhism was at the height of its influence and a significant number of Buddhist centers were built or renovated.

The Buddhist art of Kushan Gandhara was a synthesis of Greco-Roman, Iranian and Indian elements. The Gandhāran Buddhist texts also date from this period. Written in Gāndhārī Prakrit, they are the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered (c. 1st century CE). According to Richard Salomon, most of them belong to the Dharmaguptaka school.

Emperor Kanishka (128–151 CE) is particularly known for his support of Buddhism. During his reign, stupas and monasteries were built in the Gandhāran city of Peshawar (Skt. &quot;Purusapura&quot;), which he used as a capital. Kushan royal support and the opening of trade routes allowed Gandharan Buddhism to spread along the Silk Road to Central Asia, the Tarim Basin and thus to China.

Kanishka is also said to have convened a major Buddhist council for the Sarvastivada tradition, either in Gandhara or Kashmir. Kanishka gathered 500 learned monks partly to compile extensive commentaries on the Abhidharma, although it is possible that some editorial work was carried out upon the existing Sarvastivada canon itself. Allegedly during the council there were altogether three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. The main fruit of this council was the compilation of the vast commentary known as the Mahā-Vibhāshā (&quot;Great Exegesis&quot;), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma. Modern scholars such as Etienne Lamotte and David Snellgrove have questioned the veracity of this traditional account.

Scholars believe that it was also around this time that a significant change was made in the language of the Sarvāstivādin canon, by converting an earlier Prakrit version into Sanskrit. Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of Brahmanism in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices.

After the fall of the Kushans, small kingdoms ruled the Gandharan region, and later the Hephthalite White Huns conquered the area (circa 440s–670). Under the Hephthalites, Gandharan Buddhism continued to thrive in cities like Balkh (Bactria), as remarked by Xuanzang who visited the region in the 7th century. Xuanzang notes that there were over a hundred Buddhist monasteries in the city, including the Nava Vihara as well many stupas and monks. After the end of the Hephthalite empire, Gandharan Buddhism declined in Gandhara proper (in the Peshawar basin). However it continued to thrive in adjacent areas like the Swat Valley of Pakistan, Gilgit, Kashmir and in Afghanistan (in sites such as Bamiyan).

==Spread to Central Asia==
Central Asia was home to the international trade route known as the Silk Road, which carried goods between China, India, the Middle East and the Mediterranean world. Buddhism was present in this region from about the second century BCE. Initially, the Dharmaguptaka school was the most successful in their efforts to spread Buddhism in Central Asia. The Kingdom of Khotan was one of the earliest Buddhist kingdoms in the area and helped transmit Buddhism from India to China.

The Kushan Empire&#x27;s unification of most of this area and their support of Buddhism allowed it to easily spread along the trade routes of the region throughout Central Asia. During the first century CE under the Kushans, the Sarvastivada school flourished in this region, some of the monks also bringing Mahayana teachings with them. Buddhism would eventually reach modern-day Pakistan, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. As Buddhism reached many of these lands, Buddhists began to translate and produce texts in the local languages, such as Khotanese (a Middle Iranian language), Sogdian (also Iranian), Uighur (Turkish), Tangut, Tibetan, and Chinese.

Central Asians played a key role in the transmission of Buddhism to China The first translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were Iranians, including the Parthian An Shigao (c. 148 CE), the Yuezhi Zhi Qian and Kang Sengkai (from Samarkand). Thirty-seven early translators of Buddhist texts are known, and the majority of them have been identified as hailing from the Iranian cultural sphere. The Zoroastrian Sassanian empire (226–651 CE) would eventually rule over many of these regions (such as Parthia and Sogdia), but they tolerated the Buddhist religion.

However, during the mid-seventh century, the Arab conquest of the Iranian Plateau followed by the Muslim conquests of Afghanistan and the later establishment of the Ghaznavid kingdom in Central Asia (c. 977–1186) led to the decline and eventual disappearance of Buddhism from most of these regions.

Buddhism also flourished in the eastern part of central Asia, like the Tarim Basin. Indians and Iranians lived in major cities of this region like Kashgar and Khotan. The region has revealed extremely rich Buddhist works of art as well as Buddhist texts such as those found in Dunhuang. Serindian art is highly reminiscent of the Gandhāran style, and scriptures in the Gandhāri script Kharoṣṭhī have been found. The Uyghurs conquered the area in the 8th century and blended with the local Iranian peoples, absorbing the Buddhist culture of the region. They were later absorbed by the Mongol Yuan dynasty.

Many printed Buddhist texts from the region date to the Yuan, and they were printed in the Uyghur, Xixia and Sanskrit languages. The Uyghurs also restored cave temples and repainted Buddhist wall paintings such as at Bezeklik. Uyghur Buddhism was the last major Buddhist culture in Xinjiang and it lasted until the mid 14th century. After the Islamicisation of Xinjiang, Buddhism ceased to be a major religion there.

== Gupta and Pāla eras ==
Buddhism continued to flourish in India during the Gupta Empire (4th–6th centuries) which brought order to much of north India. Gupta rulers such as Kumaragupta I (c. 414–455 CE) supported Buddhism. He enlarged Nālandā university, which became the largest and most influential Buddhist university in India for many centuries. Great Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga, and Dharmakirti taught philosophy there. Nalanda remained a central place for the study of epistemology (pramana).

Another major Buddhist university was Valabhi, in western India, which was second only to Nalanda in the 5th century. This influential university was founded and supported by the Maitraka dynasty. It was mainly a center of sravakayana Buddhism (that is, non-Mahayana), but was also a place for the study of numerous subjects including secular topics of higher education (such as medicine, logic and grammar).

The influence of the Gupta style of Buddhist art spread along with the faith from south-east Asia to China. During this period, Chinese pilgrims also visited India to study Buddhism.

One of these pilgrims was Faxian, who visited India during the reign of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta II in 405, and commented on the prosperity and mild administration of the Gupta empire. Another Chinese traveler who reached India after the end of the Guptas in the 7th century was Xuanzang. He reported in his travels across India that Buddhism was popular in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. While reporting many deserted stupas in the area around modern day Nepal and the persecution of Buddhists by Shashanka in the Kingdom of Gauda in modern-day West Bengal, Xuanzang complimented the patronage of emperor Harṣavardana (c. 590–647 CE). Xuanzang also noted that in various regions Buddhism was giving way to Jainism and Hinduism.

After the fall of Harsha&#x27;s empire, the Gangetic plain saw the rise of many small feuding kingdoms. This was to last until the rise of the Pāla Empire (8th–12th centuries) in the Bengal region. The Pālas were stanch supporters of Buddhism, and built several important Buddhist centers, such as Vikramashila, Somapura and Odantapuri. They also supported older centers like Nalanda and Bodh Gaya. It was at these great Buddhist centers that scholars developed the philosophies of Vajrayana, Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, Yogacara and Pramana, as well as the study of linguistics, medicine, astronomy, music, painting, and sculpture. Great Buddhist scholars such as Atisha and Santaraksita date from this period. Under the Pālas, Vajrayana Buddhism thus flourished and spread to Tibet, Bhutan and Sikkim.

A milestone in the decline of Indian Buddhism in the North occurred in 1193 when Turkic Islamic raiders under Muhammad Khilji burnt Nālandā. By the end of the 12th century, following the Islamic conquest of the Buddhist strongholds in Bihar and Bengal by Delhi Sultanate&#x27;s Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji, and the loss of political support coupled with social pressures, the practice of Buddhism retreated to the Himalayan foothills in the North and Sri Lanka in the south. Additionally, the influence of Buddhism also waned due to Hinduism&#x27;s revival movements such as Advaita, and the rise of the bhakti movement.

===Vajrayāna===
Under the Gupta and Pala empires, a Tantric Buddhist movement arose, variously named Vajrayāna, Mantrayāna, Tantric Buddhism and Esoteric Buddhism. It promoted new practices such as the use of mantras, dharanis, mudras, mandalas and the visualization of deities and Buddhas and developed a new class of literature, the Buddhist Tantras. The movement can be traced back to groups of wandering yogis called mahasiddhas.

Various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism, especially the Buddhist Yogini tantras. The Mañjusrimulakalpa, which later came to classified under Kriyatantra, states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri. The Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, prescribes acting as a Shaiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. The Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Shaiva text &quot;Tantrasadbhava&quot;, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.

===Tibetan Buddhism===

Buddhism arrived late in Tibet, during the 7th century. The form that predominated, via the south of Tibet, was a blend of &quot;mahāyāna&quot; and &quot;vajrayāna&quot; from the universities of the Pāla empire of the Bengal region in eastern India. Sarvāstivādin influence came from the south west (Kashmir) and the north west (Khotan). Their texts found their way into the Tibetan Buddhist canon, providing the Tibetans with almost all of their primary sources about the Foundation Vehicle. A subsect of this school, Mūlasarvāstivāda was the source of the Tibetan Vinaya. Chan Buddhism was introduced via east Tibet from China and left its impression, but was rendered of lesser importance by early political events.

From the outset, Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic Bon religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but with royal patronage, it thrived to a peak under King Rälpachän(817–836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a translation methodology that was highly literal. Despite a reversal in Buddhist influence which began under King Langdarma (836–842), the following centuries saw a colossal effort in collecting available Indian sources, many of which are now extant only in Tibetan translation. Tibetan Buddhism was favored above other religions by the rulers of imperial Chinese and Mongol Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368).

==East Asian Buddhism==
===China===

Buddhism was introduced in China during the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) and was present by around 50 CE. Although the archaeological record confirms that Buddhism was introduced sometime during the Han dynasty, it did not flourish in China until the Six Dynasties period (220–589 CE). The first documented Buddhist texts translated into Chinese are those of the Parthian An Shigao (148–180 CE). The first known Mahāyāna scriptural texts are translations into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokakṣema in Luoyang, between 178 and 189 CE. Early translators faced the difficulty of communicating foreign Buddhist concepts to the Chinese, and often used Taoist terminology to explain them. This has been called &quot;concept-matching&quot;. Later translators such as Kumārajīva (334–413 CE) improved the translation methods of Chinese Buddhism considerably.

Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on &quot;money trees&quot;, dated c. 200 CE, in typical Gandhāran drawing style. In the period between 460 and 525 CE during the Northern Wei dynasty, the Chinese-constructed Yungang Grottoes, and the Longmen Grottoes, which include some impressive monumental sculptures. In the fifth century, Chinese Buddhists also developed new schools and traditions, such as the Tiantai school, the Huayen school, the Pure Land school and Chan Buddhism.

Buddhism continued to grow during the early Tang dynasty (618–907). It was during this dynasty that the Chinese monk Xuanzang traveled to India, bringing back 657 Buddhist texts along with relics and statues. He established a famed translation school in the Tang capital of Chang&#x27;an (today&#x27;s Xi&#x27;an), focusing on Yogacara school texts. Also during the Tang, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism was introduced from India. The Tang dynasty also saw the growth of Chan Buddhism (Zen), with the great Zen masters such as Mazu Daoyi and Linji Yixuan. In the later Tang, Chinese Buddhism suffered a setback during the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution of 845.

Buddhism recovered during the Song dynasty (960–1279), which is known as the &quot;golden age&quot; of Chan. During this period Chinese Chan influenced Korean and Japanese Buddhism. Pure Land Buddhism also became popular during this period and was often practiced together with Chan. It was also during the Song that the entire Chinese Buddhist canon was printed using over 130,000 wooden printing blocks.

During the Yuan dynasty, Tibetan Buddhism became the state religion. During the Ming (1368–1644), the Chan school became the dominant tradition in China and all monks were affiliated with Chan. In the 17th century, Buddhism was spread to Taiwan by Chinese immigrants.
===Vietnam===
There is disagreement on when exactly Buddhism arrived in Vietnam. Buddhism may have arrived as early as the 3rd or 2nd century BCE via India, or alternatively during the 1st or 2nd century from China. Whatever the case, Mahayana Buddhism had been established by the second century CE in Vietnam. By the 9th century, both Pure Land and Thien (Zen) were major Vietnamese Buddhist schools. In the southern Kingdom of Champa, Hinduism, Theravada, and Mahayana were all practiced until the 15th century, when an invasion from the north led to the dominance of Chinese-based forms of Buddhism. However Theravada Buddhism continues to exist in the south of Vietnam. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus very similar to Chinese Buddhism and to some extent reflects the structure of Chinese Buddhism after the Song dynasty. Vietnamese Buddhism also has a symbiotic relationship with Taoism, Chinese spirituality and the native Vietnamese religion.

===Korea===
Buddhism was introduced to the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning around 372 CE. During the 6th century, many Korean monks traveled to China and India to study Buddhism and various Korean Buddhist schools developed. Buddhism prospered in Korea during the North–South States Period (688–926) when it became a dominant force in society. Buddhism continued to be popular in the Goryeo period (918–1392), in particular Seon (Zen) Buddhism. However, during the Confucian Yi dynasty of the Joseon period, Buddhism faced a reversal of fortunes beginning with the confiscation of monastery lands, the closing of monasteries and the ban on ordination by aristocrats in the 15th century.

===Japan===
Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the 6th century by Korean monks bearing sutras and an image of the Buddha. During the Nara Period (710–794), emperor Shōmu ordered the building of temples throughout his realm. Numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of Nara, such as the five-story pagoda and Golden Hall of the Hōryū-ji, or the Kōfuku-ji temple. There was also a proliferation of Buddhist sects in the capital city of Nara, known as the &quot;Nanto Rokushū&quot; (&quot;the Six Nara Sects&quot;). The most influential of these being the Kegon school (from the Chinese Huayan).

During the late Nara, the key figures of Kūkai (774–835) and Saichō (767–822) founded the influential Japanese schools of Shingon and Tendai, respectively. An important doctrine for these schools was &quot;hongaku&quot; (innate awakening or original enlightenment), a doctrine which was influential for all subsequent Japanese Buddhism. Buddhism also influenced the Japanese religion of Shinto, which incorporated Buddhist elements.

During the later Kamakura period (1185–1333), there were six new Buddhist schools founded which competed with the older Nara schools and are known as &quot;New Buddhism&quot; (&quot;Shin Bukkyō&quot;) or &quot;Kamakura Buddhism.&quot; They include the influential Pure Land schools of Hōnen (1133–1212) and Shinran (1173–1263), the Rinzai and Soto schools of Zen founded by Eisai (1141–1215) and Dōgen (1200–1253) as well as the Lotus Sutra school of Nichiren (1222–1282).

Japanese Buddhist art was especially productive between the 8th and 13th centuries during Nara period (710–794), Heian period (794–1185) and Kamakura period (1185–1333). Buddhism, especially Zen, remained culturally influential during the Ashikaga period (1333–1573) and the Tokugawa era (1603–1867).

===Mongolia===
The rulers of the nomadic empires such as the Xiongnu (209 BCE – 93 CE), Xianbei (93-234), Rouran Khaganate (late 4th c. - middle 6th c.) and the Göktürks (middle first mill. AD) received missionaries and built temples for them. Buddhism prevailed among aristocrats and was patronised by the monarchs of the Xianbei-led Northern Wei dynasty (386–535) and of the Khitan-led Liao dynasty (916–1125). The Khitans aristocracy regarded Buddhism as the culture of the Uyghur Khaganate that dominated the Mongolian steppes before the rise of the Liao dynasty. The monarchs of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115–1234) also regarded Buddhism as part of their culture.

Genghis Khan (c. 1162 - 1227) and his immediate successors conquered nearly all of Asia and European Russia and sent armies as far as central Europe and Southeast Asia. The emperors of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) in the 13th and 14th century converted to Tibetan Buddhism. The founder of the Yuan dynasty, Kublai Khan, invited lama Drogön Chögyal Phagpa of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism to spread Buddhism throughout his realm (the second introduction of Buddhism among the Mongols). Buddhism became the &quot;de facto&quot; state religion of the Yuan dynasty. In 1269, Kublai Khan commissioned Phagpa lama to design a new writing system to unify the writing systems of the multilingual empire. The &#x27;Phags-pa script, also known as the &quot;Square script&quot;, was based on the Tibetan script and written vertically from top was designed to write in Mongolian, Tibetan, Chinese, Uighur and Sanskrit languages and served as the official script of the empire. The activities of the Mongols were conducive to the prominency of the Sakya school and then the Gelug, and to the further development of Tibeto-Mongolian culture.

The Mongols returned to shamanic traditions after the collapse of the Yuan dynasty in 1368 and during the Northern Yuan dynasty.

In 1578 Altan Khan, a Mongol military leader with ambitions to unite the Mongols and to emulate the career of Genghis Khan, invited the 3rd Dalai Lama, the head of the rising Gelug lineage to a summit. They formed an alliance that gave Altan Khan legitimacy and religious sanction for his imperial pretensions and that provided the Buddhist school with protection and patronage. Altan Khan recognized Sonam Gyatso lama as a reincarnation of Phagpa lama, gave the Tibetan leader the title of Dalai Lama (&quot;Ocean Lama&quot;), which his successors still hold. Sonam Gyatso, in turn, recognized Altan as a reincarnation of Kublai Khan. Thus, Altan added legitimacy to the title &quot;khan&quot; that he had assumed, while Sonam Gyatso received support for the supremacy he sought over the Tibetan sangha. Since this meeting, the heads of the Gelugpa school became known as Dalai Lamas. Altan Khan also bestowed the title Ochirdara (Очирдар, from Sanskr. Vajradhara) to Sonam Gyatso.

Altan Khan died soon after, but in the next century Gelug Buddhism spread throughout Mongolia.

==Southeast Asian Buddhism==

Since around 500 BCE, the culture of India has exerted influence on Southeast Asian countries. Land and maritime trade routes linked India with the region and both Hindu and Buddhist beliefs became influential there during the period of the Indianization of Southeast Asia. For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was, therefore, the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The Pāli and Sanskrit languages and Indian scripts, together with Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, Brahmanism, and Hinduism, were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata.

From the 5th to the 13th centuries, South-East Asia saw a series of powerful states which were extremely active in the promotion of Buddhism and Buddhist art alongside Hinduism. The main Buddhist influence now came directly by sea from the Indian subcontinent, so that these empires essentially followed the Mahāyāna faith. Examples include mainland kingdoms like Funan, the Khmer Empire and the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai as well as Island kingdoms like the Kalingga Kingdom, the Srivijaya Empire, Mataram and Majapahit.

Buddhist monks traveled to China from the kingdom of Funan in the 5th century CE, bringing Mahayana texts, a sign that the religion was already established in the region by this point. Mahayana Buddhism and Hinduism were the main religions of the Khmer Empire (802–1431), a state that dominated most of the South-East Asian peninsula during its time. Under the Khmer, numerous temples, both Hindu and Buddhist, were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. One of the greatest Khmer kings, Jayavarman VII (1181–1219), built large Mahāyāna Buddhist structures at Bayon and Angkor Thom.

In the Indonesian island of Java, Indianized kingdoms like the Kalingga Kingdom (6–7th centuries) were destinations for Chinese monks seeking out Buddhist texts. The Malay Srivijaya (650–1377), a maritime empire centered on the island of Sumatra, adopted Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhism and spread Buddhism to Java, Malaya and other regions they conquered.

The Chinese Buddhist Yijing described their capital at Palembang as a great center of Buddhist learning where the emperor supported over a thousand monks at his court. Yijing also testified to the importance of Buddhism as early as the year 671 and advised future Chinese pilgrims to spend a year or two in Palembang. Atiśa studied there before travelling to Tibet as a missionary. As Srivijaya expanded, Buddhism thrived and also became part of a local syncretism that incorporated several different religions such as Hinduism and other indigenous traditions.

In the island of Java, another kingdom also promoted Mahayana Buddhist culture, the Mataram Kingdom (732–1006), a major rival of Srivijaya. They are known for their monumental temple construction, especially the massive Borobudur, as well as Kalasan, Sewu, and Prambanan. Indonesian Buddhism, alongside Hinduism, continued to thrive under the Majapahit Empire (1293–1527), but was completely replaced by Islam afterward.

===Theravāda Renaissance===

The lands of the Mon and Pyu peoples in Myanmar show extensive evidence of Theravada presence in the Irrawaddy and Chao Phraya basins from the 5th century CE onwards. Theravada Buddhism in Burma initially coexisted with other forms of Buddhism and other religions. After the decline of Buddhism in the Indian mainland, Theravada Buddhist monks from Sri Lanka mounted missionary efforts in Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, and they were successful in converting all these regions to Theravada Buddhism.

King Anawrahta (1044–1078); the founder of the Pagan Empire, adopted the Theravādin Buddhist faith from Sri Lanka, building numerous Buddhist temples at his capital of Pagan. Invasions from the Burmese and the Mongols weakened Theravada in this region and it had to be reintroduced from Sri Lanka. During the Mon Hanthawaddy Kingdom (1287–1552), Theravada Buddhism was the dominant religion in Burma, with strong ties to Sri Lankan Buddhism. One of their kings, Dhammazedi, is particularly known for his reformation of Burmese Buddhism from the Sri Lankan Mahavihara tradition between 1476 and 1479. Theravada remained the official religion of the subsequent Burmese Taungoo Dynasty (1510–1752).

During the reign of the Khmer King Jayavarman VII (r. c. 1181–1218), Theravada Buddhism was promoted by the royal family and Sri Lankan monks, including his son Tamalinda who himself had traveled to Sri Lanka. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Theravada became the dominant religion of Cambodia, and monasteries replaced the local priestly classes. The Theravāda faith was also adopted by the Thai kingdom of Sukhothai as the state religion during the reign of Ram Khamhaeng (1237/1247–1298). Theravāda Buddhism was further reinforced during the Ayutthaya period (14th–18th century), becoming an integral part of Thai society.

==Modern period==
The modern era brought new challenges to the Buddhist religion such as the colonization of traditionally Buddhist Asian countries by Western states, which weakened the traditional political structures which supported the religion, as well as criticism and competition from Christianity. Modern wars, communist anti-religious pressure, the growth of capitalism, modern science and regional political instability are also influential pressures on modern Buddhism.

=== South and Southeast Asia ===

In British Ceylon, Christian missionaries ran all the state-approved schools and commonly criticized Buddhist beliefs. By 1865, Buddhist monks began a counter movement against Christian attacks, printing pamphlets and debating Christians in public, such as at the famous Panadura debate in 1873, which saw the monk Gunananda win a debate in front of a crowd of 10,000.

During this period a new form of Buddhism began to take shape, termed Buddhist modernism (or sometimes &quot;Protestant Buddhism&quot;), which tended to see the Buddha from a humanist point of view and claimed that Buddhism was a rational and scientific religion. Important figures in this new movement include the American convert Henry Olcott (1832–1907) and Anagarika Dharmapala (1864–1933), who promoted Buddhist schools, lay organizations and the printing of newspapers. Dharmapala also founded the Mahā Bodhi Society to restore the dilapidated Indian site of Bodh Gaya. Dharmapala also traveled to the UK and the US to teach Buddhism.

This society helped usher in a revival of Buddhism in India, where Buddhism became popular among some Indian intellectuals. One of these was the lawyer B. R. Ambedkar (1891–1956), leader of the Dalit Buddhist movement, who urged low caste Indian Dalits to convert to Buddhism. Other Indian figures include Rahul Sankrityayan (1893–1963), Dharmanand Kosambi (1876–1941) and Bhadant Anand Kausalyayan.

In Burma, a central modern figure is King Mindon (r. 1853–1878), who convened the 5th Buddhist council (1868–71), where different editions of the Pali Canon were cross-checked and a final version was inscribed on 729 stone slabs, currently still the world&#x27;s largest book. A new meditation movement arose in Burma, called the Vipassana movement, beginning with figures such as Medawi (1728–1816), who was instrumental in the promotion of Buddhist meditation practices. In 1956, Burmese politician U Nu presided over a sixth council, which saw monks from various Theravada countries produce another new edition of the Pali Canon. Recently, Buddhist monks have become involved in political protest movements such as the Saffron Revolution of 2007.

Thailand, which was the only country to avoid colonization, had two important Buddhist kings, who pushed for modernization and reformation of the Buddhist sangha. They were King Mongkut (r. 1851–68), and his son King Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910), who were responsible for several key modern reforms of Thai Buddhism. Two recent Thai modernist movements are the monastic revival of the Thai forest tradition and the Wat Phra Dhammakāya movement.

From 1893, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were all French colonies. The Communists came to power in Laos in 1975. There was no widespread repression of the Buddhist sangha, but the communist government has sought to control the Sangha and use it as a tool to spread its ideology. In Cambodia however, the communist terror of the Khmer Rouge during 1975–79 caused much damage to the Buddhist sangha.

=== East Asia ===
The opening of Japan in 1853 by Admiral Perry and the Meiji Restoration of 1868 led to the end of feudal Japan and rapid modernization. A new form of State Shinto arose as a strong competitor to Buddhism when it was adopted by the Japanese government. In 1872, the Japanese government decreed that Buddhist clerics could marry. These changes led to modernization efforts by Japanese Buddhism which saw the setting up of publishing houses and the study of Western philosophy and scholarship. In the post-war period, Japanese new religions arose, many of them influenced by Buddhism.

Chinese Buddhism meanwhile, suffered much destruction during the Christian-inspired Taiping rebellion (1850–64), but saw a modest revival during the Republican period (1912–49). A key figure was Taixu (T’ai-hsü, 1899–1947), who is associated with the modernist Humanistic Buddhism trend of Chinese Buddhism. The Communist Cultural Revolution (1966–76) led to the closing of all Buddhist monasteries and widespread destruction of Buddhist institutions. However, since 1977, there has been a general shift in the policy of the communist government, and Buddhist activity, both monastic and lay, has once again been renewed.

Korean Buddhism suffered a series of setbacks during the Japanese invasions, occupation, and also during the Korean war. North Korea&#x27;s harsh government nevertheless offers some limited support to the sangha, but it closely controls all activity. In South Korea, Buddhism underwent a revival, with youth groups being influential and temples being rebuilt with government aid. An example of a recent modern form of Korean Buddhism is Won Buddhism.

=== Central Asia ===

Tibet (which had been a client state of the Qing dynasty) remained a traditional theocratic state (the Ganden Phodrang polity) with the Dalai Lamas as heads of state, from 1912 until the Chinese communist invasion in 1950. The 14th Dalai Lama fled the country in 1959. A Tibetan exile community was established in India, with its center at Dharamsala, which today contains various Buddhist monasteries and is a center for the study of Tibetan Buddhism. The 14th Dalai Lama has become one of the most popular Buddhist leaders in the world today.

During the Red Guard period (1966–67), Chinese communists destroyed around 6,000 monasteries in Tibet along with their art and books, an attempt to wipe out the Tibetan Buddhist culture. After 1980, Chinese repression of Tibetan Buddhism has decreased and the situation has improved with the reprinting of the Tibetan Canon and some artistic restoration. In the nearby countries of Bhutan, and Nepal, Vajrayana Buddhism continues to flourish as a major religion.

In Mongolia, which also has Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, communist rule (between 1924 and 1990) saw much repression of Buddhism. However, Buddhism is now undergoing a revival in post-communist Mongolia, with more ordained monks and nuns, and with 284 monasteries since 2009. More recent liberal attitudes towards religion has also benefited the Buddhists of Tuva and Buryatia, as well as the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia.

Another modern development was the founding of the Kalmyk Khanate in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire as Kalmykia, which remains a federal subject of Russia with a majority Buddhist religion.

=== Western world ===

During the 19th century, Western intellectuals became more aware of Buddhism through various contacts such as colonial servants, administrators, and Christian missionaries. Sir Edwin Arnold&#x27;s book-length poem &quot;The Light of Asia&quot; (1879), a life of the Buddha, was a successful early publication on Buddhism that led to much interest among English speaking middle classes. The work of western Buddhist scholars like Hermann Oldenberg (1854–1920), T. W. Rhys Davids (1843–1922) and F. Max Müller was also influential in introducing Buddhism to western audiences.

The late 19th century also saw the first-known modern western conversions to Buddhism, including leading Theosophists Henry Steel Olcott and Helena Blavatsky in 1880 in Sri Lanka. The Theosophical Society was very influential in popularizing Indian religions in the west. The 19th century also saw the first western monastics such as U Dhammaloka, Ananda Metteyya and the German Nyānatiloka Thera (1878–1956).

Another important element leading to the growth of Buddhism in the west was the large scale immigration of Chinese and Japanese to the United States and Canada in the late 19th century. Refugees from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia have also immigrated to west, beginning in 1975. Asian Buddhists such as DT Suzuki, Hsüan Hua, Hakuun Yasutani and Thích Nhất Hạnh were influential in teaching Zen Buddhism in the West in the 20th century. Shunryu Suzuki opened the Soto San Francisco Zen Center (1961) and the Tassajara Monastery (1967).

The Tibetan diaspora has also been active in promoting Tibetan Buddhism in the West. All of the four major Tibetan Buddhist schools have a presence in the West and have attracted Western converts. The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.

The Theravada tradition has established various temples in the West, especially among immigrant communities in the US. Theravada vipassana meditation was also established in the West, through the founding of institutions like the Insight Meditation Society in 1975 and the vipassana centers of S. N. Goenka. The Thai forest tradition has also established communities in the US and in the UK. In the UK, the Triratna Buddhist Community arose as a new modern Buddhist movement.

In Continental Europe, interest in Buddhism also increased during the late 20th century, with an exponential increase in Buddhist groups in countries like Germany. In France and Spain, Tibetan Buddhism has the largest following. Tibetan, East Asian and Theravada traditions are now also present and active in Australia and New Zealand. Tibetan and Zen Buddhism also have established a small presence in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela.

<text>The Turkish makam (Turkish: &quot;makam&quot; pl. &quot;makamlar&quot;; from the Arabic word &quot;maqām&quot; ) is a system of melody types used in Turkish classical music and Turkish folk music. It provides a complex set of rules for composing and performance. Each makam specifies a unique intervalic structure (&quot;cinsler&quot; meaning genera) and melodic development (&quot;seyir&quot;). Whether a fixed composition (&quot;beste&quot;, &quot;şarkı&quot;, &quot;peşrev&quot;, &quot;âyin&quot;, etc.) or a spontaneous composition (&quot;gazel&quot;, &quot;taksim&quot;, recitation of &quot;Kuran-ı Kerim&quot;, &quot;Mevlid&quot;, etc.), all attempt to follow the melody type. The rhythmic counterpart of makam in Turkish music is usul.

== Geographic and cultural relations ==
The Turkish makam system has some corresponding relationships to maqams in Arabic music and &quot;echos&quot; in Byzantine music. Some theories suggest the origin of the makam to be the city of Mosul in Iraq. &quot;Mula Othman Al-Musili,&quot; in reference to his city of origin, is said to have served in the Ottoman Palace in Istanbul and influenced Turkish Ottoman music. More distant modal relatives include those of Central Asian Turkic musics such as Uyghur “muqam” and Uzbek shashmakom. North and South Indian classical raga-based music employs similar modal principles. Some scholars find echoes of Turkish makam in former Ottoman provinces of the Balkans. All of these concepts roughly correspond to mode in Western classical music, although their compositional rules vary.
==Similarities between Turkish classical and folk music==
Turkish classical music and Turkish folk music are both based on modal systems. &quot;Makam&quot; is the name of the scale in classical music, while &quot;Ayak&quot; (&quot;Ayağı&quot;) is the name of the scale in folk music. Makam and Ayak are similar; following are some examples:

*Yahyalı Kerem Ayağı: Hüseyni Makamı
*Garip Ayağı: Hicaz Makamı
*Düz Kerem Ayağı: Karcığar Makamı
*Yanık Kerem Ayağı: Nikriz Makamı
*Muhalif Ayağı: Segâh Makamı
*Tatyan Kerem Ayağı: Hüzzam Makamı
*Misket Ayağı: Eviç Makamı
*Bozlak Ayağı: Kürdî Makamı
*Kalenderi Ayağı: Sabâ Makamı
*Müstezat veya Beşirî Ayağı: Mahur Makamı

There are some similarities between the rhythms used in Turkish folk music and Turkish classical music, with respect to their forms, classification, and rhythmic patterns.

==Makam building blocks==

===Commas and accidentals===

In Turkish music theory, the octave is divided into 53 equal intervals known as commas (&quot;koma&quot;), specifically the Holdrian comma. Each whole tone is an interval equivalent to nine commas. In practice, only 24 of the 53 commas are used, as highlighted in the figure and table below. The following figure gives the comma values of Turkish accidentals. In the context of the Arab maqam, this system is not of equal temperament. In fact, in the Western system of temperament, C-sharp and D-flat—which are functionally the same tone—are equivalent to 4.5 commas in the Turkish system; thus, they fall directly in the center of the line depicted above.

===Accidentals===
Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek notation adds 6 accidentals in addition to Western music theory&#x27;s 4 accidentals. Note that the commonly used quarter-tone symbols and are used in this system to indicate a tone&#x27;s adjusting with a &quot;koma&quot;, not a quarter-tone, like in Arabic maqam and Helmholtz-Ellis notation. &quot;Makam Rast&quot; is therefore notated in the &quot;same&quot; in Arabic and Turkish music, but Turkish Rast&#x27;s third is a just major third, not a neutral third.

===Notes===
Unlike in Western music, where the note C, for example, is called &#x27;C&#x27; regardless of what octave it might be in, in the Turkish system the notes are – for the most part – individually named (although many are variations on a basic name); this can be seen in the following table, which covers the notes from middle C (&quot;Kaba Çârgâh&quot;, C) to the same note two octaves above (&quot;Tîz Çârgâh&quot;, C):

The following table gives the tones over two octaves (ordered from highest to lowest), the pitch in commas and cents relative to the lowest note (equivalent to Western middle C), along with the nearest equivalent equal-temperament tone. The tones of the Çârgâh scale are shown in bold.

===Intervals===

The names and symbols of the different intervals (&quot;şifre&quot;) are shown in the following table:

===Tetrachords (&quot;dörtlüler&quot;) and pentachords (&quot;beşliler&quot;)===
Similar to the construction of maqamat noted above, a makam in Turkish music is built of a tetrachord built atop a pentachord, or vice versa. Trichords exist, e.g. Saba, but are rarely used. Additionally, most makams have what is known as a &quot;development&quot; (&quot;genişleme&quot; in Turkish), which can occur either above or below (or both) the tonic and/or the highest note.

There are six basic tetrachords, named sometimes according to their tonic note and sometimes according to the tetrachord&#x27;s most distinctive note:
*Çârgâh
*Bûselik
*Kürdî
*Uşşâk
*Hicaz and
*Rast
There are also six basic pentachords with the same names with a tone (T) appended.

It is worth keeping in mind that these patterns can be transposed to any note in the scale, so that the tonic A (Dügâh) of the Hicaz tetrachord, for example, can be moved up a major second (9 commas) to B (Bûselik), or in fact to any other note. The other notes of the tetrachord, of course, are also transposed along with the tonic, allowing the pattern to preserve its character.

==Basic makam theory==
A makam, more than simply a selection of notes and intervals, is essentially a guide to compositional structure: any composition in a given makam will move through the notes of that makam in a more or less ordered way. This pattern is known in Turkish as &quot;seyir&quot; (meaning, &quot;route&quot;), and there are three types of &quot;seyir&quot;:

*Ascending (&quot;çıkıcı&quot;);
*Descending (&quot;inici&quot;);
*Descending-ascending (&quot;inici-çıkıcı&quot;)

Makams are built of a tetrachord plus a pentachord (or vice versa), and in terms of this construction, there are three important notes in the makam:

*The &quot;Durak&quot; (&quot;tonic&quot;), which is the initial note of the first tetrachord or pentachord and which always concludes any piece written in the makam.

*The &quot;Güçlü&quot; (&quot;dominant&quot;), which is the first note of the second tetrachord or pentachord, and which is used as a temporary tonic in the middle of a piece (in this sense, it is somewhat similar to the axial pitches mentioned above in the context of Arab music). This use of the term &quot;dominant&quot; is not to be confused with the Western dominant; while the güçlü is often the fifth scale degree, it can just as often be the fourth, and occasionally the third.

*The &quot;Yeden&quot; (&quot;leading tone&quot;), which is most often the penultimate note of any piece and which resolves into the tonic; this is sometimes close to an actual Western leading tone (either slightly sharper or slightly flatter) and sometimes close to a Western subtonic.

Additionally, there are three types of makam as a whole:

*Simple makams (&quot;Basit makamlar&quot;), almost all of which have a rising &quot;seyir&quot;,
*Transposed makams (&quot;Göçürülmüş/Şed makamlar&quot;), which as the name implies are the simple makams transposed to a different tonic,
*Compound makams (&quot;Bileşik/Mürekkeb makamlar&quot;), which are a joining of differing makams and number in the hundreds.

==Some simple makams==
===Bûselik makam===
This makam has two basic forms: in the first basic form (1), it consists of a Bûselik pentachord plus a Kürdî tetrachord on the note Hüseynî (E) and is essentially the same as the Western A minor; in the second (2), it consists of a Bûselik pentachord plus a Hicaz tetrachord on Hüseynî (E) and is identical to A harmonic minor. The tonic is A (Dügâh), the dominant Hüseynî (E), and the leading tone G-sharp (Nim Zirgüle). Additionally, when descending from the octave towards the tonic, the sixth (F, Acem) is sometimes sharpened to become F-sharp (Dik Acem), and the dominant (E, Hüseynî) flattened four commas to the note Hisar (1A). All these alternatives are shown below:

===Çârgâh makam===

This makam is thought to be identical to the Western C-major scale, but actually it is misleading to conceptualize a makam through Western music scales. Çârgâh makam consists of a Ç&quot;ârgâh pentachord&quot; and a Ç&quot;ârgâh tetrachord&quot; starting on the note Gerdâniye (G). Thus, the tonic is C (Çârgâh), the dominant is G (Gerdâniye), and the leading tone is B (Bûselik).

The çârgâh makam has at certain points in history been criticized for being a clumsy and unpleasant makam that can inspire those listening to it to engage in delinquency of various kinds.

===Hicaz makam===
===Rast makam===
This much-used makam - which is said to bring happiness and tranquility to the hearerer - consists of a Rast pentachord plus a Rast tetrachord on the note Neva (D); this is labeled (1) below. The tonic is G (Rast), the dominant D (Neva), and the leading tone F-sharp (Irak). However, when descending from the octave towards the tonic, the leading tone is always flattened 4 commas to the note Acem (F), and thus a Bûselik tetrachord replaces the Rast tetrachord; this is labeled (2) below. Additionally, there is a development (&quot;genişleme&quot;) in the makam&#x27;s lower register, below the tonic, which consists of a Rast tetrachord on the note D (Yegâh); this is labeled (1A) below.

In Turkey, the particular Muslim call to prayer (or &quot;ezan&quot; in Turkish) which occurs in the afternoon and is called &quot;Ikindi&quot;, as well as the day&#x27;s final call to prayer called &quot;Yatsı&quot;, are often recited using the Rast makam.

===Kürdî makam===
===Rast makam===
===Uşşâk makam===

This makam consists of an Uşşâk tetrachord plus a Bûselik pentachord on the note Neva (D); this is labelled (1) below. The tonic is A (Dügâh), the dominant—here actually a subdominant—is D (Neva), and the leading tone—here actually a subtonic—is G (Rast). Additionally, there is a development in the makam&#x27;s lower register, which consists of a Rast pentachord on the note D (Yegâh); this is labeled (1A) below.

In Turkey, the particular call to prayer which occurs around noon and is called &quot;&quot;Öğle&quot;&quot; is most often recited using the Uşşak makam.

<text>Samuel Melville Gibbons (January 20, 1920 – October 10, 2012) was an American politician from the state of Florida, who served in the Florida State House of Representatives, Florida State Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. He represented the city of Tampa in Congress for over 30 years.

==Early life and education==
Gibbons was born in Tampa, Florida on January 20, 1920. He went to Roosevelt Elementary School when he was a young child. The current-day auditorium is named after him. He graduated from H. B. Plant High School, where he was part of JROTC, and then went on to the University of Florida. After military service during World War II, Gibbons attended the University of Florida School of Law, graduating in 1947. He then joined four generations of his family practicing law in Tampa. He went on to marry Martha Hanley, and have three sons; Clifford Sam, Mark Hanley, and Timothy Melville. After 55 years of marriage, his wife died of cancer in 2002; Gibbons then married a recently widowed friend, Betty King Culbreath.

==Military career==
After the outbreak of World War II, Gibbons joined the United States Army as a second lieutenant in late 1941. He attained the rank of captain in the 101st Airborne before entering combat in June 1944. At 1:00 a.m. on D-day, June 6, 1944, Captain Gibbons, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, arrived by parachute near Carentan, France, on the Cotentin Peninsula. On June 13, 1944, the main German forces counterattacked south of Carentan, in a battle between German tanks and the American paratroopers lasting all day, 6 am to 10 pm, the paratroopers gave ground, defending in depth, and bent but did not break before restoring the pre-dawn line of defense. Of the 600 paratroopers that began that day fewer than 400 soldiers remained. Gibbons could count a dozen burning tanks from his view of the battlefield. The battle was portrayed in episode 2 of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;. On June 30 the 101st was withdrawn to England becoming the first battle-tested troops to return. He was later awarded the Bronze Star for his actions in Normandy.

Gibbons and the rest of the 101st went on to successfully take the first bridge in Operation Market Garden (described in Cornelius Ryan&#x27;s book &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot;). In December 1944 the 101st was in reserve when orders came down to load up on trucks and move to Bastogne to hold and await resupply. Against very long odds the 101st held successfully with dwindling supplies, once famously telling the German commander &quot;Nuts&quot; in response to a surrender request. Several movies have been made concerning the &quot;Battle of the Bulge.&quot; The 101st moved on to lead the way into Germany and eventually take Hitler&#x27;s Eagle&#x27;s Nest before meeting up with the advancing Red Army. Gibbons served in the European campaign until the end of the war. Shortly before German forces surrendered, Capt. Gibbons was promoted to major; however, a communications delay prevented Gibbons from learning of his promotion until after he had been honorably discharged. Upon returning home to Florida he authored a memoir of his wartime service, &quot;I Was There&quot;. Gibbons was awarded the French Medal of Valor in 2004 at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial during the 60th anniversary of D-day.

==Political life==
Gibbons was a member of the Democratic Party and he served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1953 to 1958. While in the state legislature, he spearheaded the effort to create the University of South Florida. He then served in the Florida Senate from 1959 to 1962 after beating the incumbent Paul Kickliter.

He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1962 from a newly created district based in Tampa after defeating segregationist Sumter de Leon Lowry Jr. in the Democratic primary and runoff elections, and was reelected 16 times. Gibbons voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but in favor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The district changed numbers three times during his tenure, from the 10th (1963–1967) to the 6th (1967–1973) to the 7th (1973–1993) to the 11th (1993–1997). He usually skated to reelection in what was generally reckoned as the only Democratic bastion on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast. However, in 1992, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote by Republican Mark Sharpe. Two years later, he defeated Sharpe again, only winning by 4,700 votes.

With Sharpe priming for yet another rematch in 1996, Gibbons opted not to run for an 18th term. He thus retired having never been defeated in 44 years as an elected official. He was succeeded by State Representative Jim Davis, whom he had endorsed as his successor.

Gibbons was acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1994 until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1995. Prior to leading the full committee, Gibbons chaired the subcommittee on trade. He was much more supportive of trade liberalization throughout his career than most House Democrats, who have leaned toward protectionism since the early 1970s.

Gibbons had a few verbal showdowns with the newly elected Republican congress during his last term. During a taped Ways and Means Committee hearing, after being denied the opportunity to speak several times, Gibbons stormed out of the room shouting about how the Democrats were being railroaded and given no time to speak. He compared the new Republicans to dictators and shouted that he had &quot;to fight you guys 50 years ago,&quot; referring to Nazi Germany in World War II.

He retired from office in 1997. The United States Courthouse at 801 North Florida Avenue in Tampa was named in his honor.

==Death==
Gibbons died October 10, 2012, aged 92.

<text>World Archery (WA, formerly &quot;Fédération Internationale de Tir à l&#x27;Arc&quot; (FITA)) is the governing body of the sport of archery. It is based in Lausanne, Switzerland. It is composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations, and is recognised by the International Olympic Committee.

==History==
FITA was founded on 4 September 1931 in Lwow, Poland (today Lviv, Ukraine). Its seven founding member states were France, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Poland, the United States, Hungary, and Italy. The aim of the organization was to create regular archery championships, and to return archery to the Olympic Games (the sport had not been featured since 1920). FITA was finally successful in returning archery to the Olympic program in the 1972 Summer Olympics.

To celebrate the organization&#x27;s 80th anniversary in July 2011, a large majority of the FITA Congress voted to change the name from FITA to the World Archery or WA.

In March 2022, in the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the federation announced that no athlete, team official, or technical official from Russia or Belarus will be permitted to participate in any international archery event, their flags and anthems are banned, and no archery events would be held in the two countries.

In July 2023, on the question that whether or not to re-allow athletics with Russian and/or Belarusian passports to participant international archery competitions under neutral identities, World Archery asked both national archery federations to submit personal data for investigations, as both federations denied to complete such requirements, WA said that it&#x27;s unlikely to allow neutral athletes unless once procedure can be completely followed.

In December 2023, World Archery launched its own OTT Service with a subscription video on demand model and live streaming of main events.

==Rankings==

World Archery publishes world rankings for each category of outdoor competitive archery (men / women; recurve / compound; individual / team / mixed team), updated following every official eligible event.

Each archer earns a ranking score for each competition. The ranking scores are calculated through a combination of the ranking factor of the tournament (as determined by the quality of competition, the number of competitors, and how recently the competition took place) and points based on the competitor&#x27;s final position in the competition. The archer&#x27;s four highest ranking scores are then combined to form their &#x27;Added Ranking Score&#x27;, which forms the basis of the ranking list.

==Events==

===Summer Olympics===

Archery was first competed at the Summer Olympic Games in 1900 and, after a long hiatus from 1924, became a regular event from 1972. Team events were added in 1988. Recurve archery is currently the only discipline competed at the Olympics.

Archery is also competed at the Summer Paralympics (recurve and compound disciplines), the Youth Olympic Games (recurve only), and the World Games (Field archery only).

===World Championships===

* World Target Championships
** World Outdoor Archery Championships
** World Indoor Archery Championships
* World Field Archery Championships
* World 3D Archery Championships
* World Ski Archery Championships
* World Para Archery Championships
* World Youth Archery Championships
* World University Archery Championships
FITA began holding Target World Championships in 1931. They were held every year until 1959, when the Championships became biennial events. 1959 was also the first year that FITA held the World Field Championship.

Presently, there are five principal formats of the World Archery Championships: Outdoor, Indoor, Youth, Para-Archery, and Field. Each is held every two years on different rotations. World Championships are also held every two years in 3D archery and University sport. In 2007, a ski archery World Championships was held in Moscow; this is yet to be repeated and is not included in the current rotation.

===World Cup===
The Archery World Cup is an annual event that was inaugurated in 2006. It is designed to present archery in &#x27;spectacular&#x27; locations.

The format consists of 4 rounds competed across the world during a calendar year. The best individual and mixed team performers across these rounds are then invited to compete in the World Cup Final at the end of the year.

An indoor World Cup, competed in 3 rounds with a final during the winter season, was inaugurated in the 2010–11 season.

===Other===

Archery is an optional sport at the Universiade and the Commonwealth Games.
