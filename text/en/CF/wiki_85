<text>USS &quot;Potomac&quot; (AG-25), formerly USCGC &quot;Electra&quot;, was Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s presidential yacht from 1936 until his death in 1945. On August 3, 1941, she played a decoy role while Roosevelt held a secret conference to develop the Atlantic Charter.

USS &quot;Potomac&quot; and are the last two existing U.S. presidential yachts, after was scrapped in January 2016. &quot;Potomac&quot; is now preserved in Oakland, California, as a National Historic Landmark and the only presidential yacht open to the public.

==Service history==

===1934–1945===
&quot;Potomac&quot; was built in 1934 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, as the United States Coast Guard Cutter &quot;Electra&quot;. Commissioned on October 25, 1934, &quot;Electra&quot; was a submarine chaser that served in anti-bootlegging operations. She was chosen to be the new presidential yacht after the Secret Service deemed a fire hazard. The thought of having a wooden boat that could easily catch fire was not appealing to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who as a child witnessed his aunt burn to death in an oil lamp accident. He also wanted a vessel in which he could move independently and take fishing trips. &quot;Electra&quot; was officially renamed USS &quot;Potomac&quot; on January 30, 1936, converted to serve as a presidential yacht and commissioned into the United States Navy on March 2, 1936.

There were approximately $60,000 in upgrades made while converting the ship into a presidential yacht, to make the vessel wheelchair-accessible and more accommodating. These upgrades included the conversion of the aft smokestack to a false one, a new salon, installation of brass fixtures, the presidential stateroom and bath, three guest cabins and teak decks. Additions to the fantail included a vast leather settee, patio furniture and bulletproof glass. In the false smokestack, there was an elevator with a pulley system designed so that President Roosevelt could transport himself to the boat deck. The fantail couch is designed so that each sitting party has their legs completely stretched out when sitting back and the president could sit equally as his guests with his legs supported. An antiaircraft machine gun was installed and mounted when the president was on board. Ship ballast was added to the vessel to account for these upgrades. However, the ship still rolled as far as 48 degrees in rough waters, causing many a guest to turn to the rail. The president, being the sailor he was, was affected little.

In the following years, USS &quot;Potomac&quot; was heavily used by President Roosevelt for fishing trips and informal political meetings. &quot;Potomac&quot; served as a place where relationships were built and deals were made. In 1939 the United Kingdom&#x27;s King George VI and Queen Elizabeth travelled with the Roosevelts aboard &quot;Potomac&quot; to George Washington&#x27;s home at Mount Vernon. This was the first visit by British royalty to an American president. The ship now commissioned USS &quot;Potomac&quot; was categorized as AG-25, indicating the Navy ship designation of Auxiliary Miscellaneous and number 25th in this designation, and was known informally as the “Floating White House”.

It is rumored that the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 was signed on board the ship. Ship logs have been recovered documenting voyages to the Gulf of Mexico and Dry Tortugas, Florida. On March 28, 1941, President Roosevelt delivered a fireside chat to the nation from the radio room of USS &quot;Potomac&quot; in which he stated &quot;the time calls for courage and more courage.&quot; After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the yacht was considered a potential target and used more cautiously by the president. 

On August 3, 1941, President Roosevelt left Washington to board &quot;Potomac&quot; at the submarine base at New London, Connecticut. &quot;Potomac&quot; then sailed for Apponagansett Bay, Massachusetts, where the president did some fishing and entertained guests including Crown Princess Märtha of Norway. Eventually &quot;Potomac&quot; anchored in Menemsha Bight in Vineyard Sound, where the heavy cruiser already lay at anchor. In the early hours of August 5 &quot;Potomac&quot; came alongside &quot;Augusta&quot; and the president and his party transferred to the warship. &quot;Augusta&quot; then proceeded at high speed to Newfoundland for a clandestine meeting between Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. During this meeting, Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to the Atlantic Charter, laying out the principles of the Allied partnership during World War II and setting the scene for the United Nations to plan the post-war peace.

In the meantime and for security purposes, the President&#x27;s flag continued to be flown from &quot;Potomac&quot; while she transited the Cape Cod Canal in New England waters. A Secret Service man, approximating the president in size and affecting his mannerisms when visible from a distance, played a starring role in the deception. Press releases issued daily from &quot;Potomac&quot; led all who read them to believe that the president was really embarked on a pleasure cruise on his yacht. After the meetings, &quot;Augusta&quot; returned the president to &quot;Potomac&quot; on August 14.

After President Roosevelt&#x27;s death, &quot;Potomac&quot; was decommissioned by the Navy, and returned to the US Coast Guard in November 1945.

===1945–1980===
USS &quot;Potomac&quot; was decommissioned by President Harry S. Truman, who chose the larger as his presidential yacht. Unlike his predecessor, Truman was not a sailor and could not handle the extreme rolling on the &quot;Potomac&quot;. Being an accomplished classical pianist, Truman also wanted a grand piano aboard his yacht, which the &quot;Potomac&quot; could not accommodate. The Coast Guard decommissioned &quot;Potomac&quot; on May 23, 1946.

After being decommissioned, &quot;Potomac&quot; remained docked in Cambridge, Maryland and served with the Maryland Tidewater Fisheries Commission as one of forty fishery enforcement boats for the clam, crab, fish and oyster fishermen of the area until 1960. To accommodate President Roosevelt&#x27;s need for wheelchair accessibility, a concealed elevator had been installed inside what had been one of &quot;Potomac&quot;″s smokestacks to carry the president from the main deck to the boat deck. This smokestack-elevator shaft was removed and now sits in Cambridge at Long Wharf park as a monument to the former president and his 1935 visit to Cambridge on the previous presidential yacht, .

&quot;Potomac&quot; was sold to Warren G. Toone in April 1960 and ostensibly used as a private ferry boat between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In reality she was used for offshore gambling.In 1962, there was a failed attempt to attend the World&#x27;s Fair in Seattle due to engine trouble in Long Beach. She was registered in 1963 by Hydro-Capital in Newport Beach, California as a museum ship with call sign WA9710. Records show &quot;Potomac&quot;″s home port was Los Angeles from 1963 to 1967.
In January 1964 she was purchased by Elvis Presley for US$55,000 as a gift to the March of Dimes, so they could auction it, but they kindly declined and therefore it was then offered to St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital, in Memphis, to sell as a fund raiser. The hospital was able to sell the yacht that same year for US$65,000. &quot;Potomac&quot; was then registered in 1967 to Marie Augustina Pagliasso of Sanger, California with the call sign WA9710. In January 1970, the vessel was out of documentation. It was rumored that there were plans to turn the yacht into a floating disco.

===1980–present===
In 1980, &quot;Potomac&quot; was involved in a large-scale drug-running operation in Mexico, which led to a drug bust at San Francisco&#x27;s Pier 26. No drugs were found aboard the yacht, but drugs were found aboard the yacht it had been traveling with. &quot;Potomac&quot; was seized by the United States Customs Service and towed to nearby Treasure Island, where she sank.

The vessel is said to have sunk due to a hull that had not been properly maintained and experienced thinning. It had been taking in water for some time.

After being refloated by the U.S. Navy just two weeks later, &quot;Potomac&quot; was sold to the first and only bidder, the nearby Port of Oakland, for $15,000.

=== The Association for the Preservation of the Presidential Yacht Potomac ===
The non-profit Association for the Preservation of the Presidential Yacht Potomac, also known as the Potomac Association, was formed in 1983 to restore and operate the yacht. With a $2.5 million government grant, James Roosevelt, FDR&#x27;s eldest son, and the Association began restoring &quot;Potomac&quot;. In April 1993, she sailed her first cruise as a restored vessel. The yacht became a culturally significant attraction in Oakland when it was opened to the public at Jack London Square in the summer of 1995.

A team of volunteers, crew and donors work to uphold the legacy of the historic presidential yacht. She continues to be berthed at Jack London Square and preserved by the Potomac Association, chaired by Michael Roosevelt, a grandson of FDR. She is open to dockside tours and regular cruises on San Francisco Bay.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Potomac&quot; was used in June 2011 to film shipboard scenes of the Paul Thomas Anderson film &quot;The Master&quot;. Actors Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and others shot scenes aboard the yacht while docked and under way.

<doc id="967194" wikidata="Q1681160" url="?curid=967194" title="James T. Blair Jr.">
<text>James Thomas Blair Jr. (March 15, 1902 – July 12, 1962) was an American Democratic politician from the state of Missouri. He served as the 44th Governor of Missouri from 1957 to 1961, as well as the 35th Lieutenant Governor of Missouri from 1949 to 1957, and a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.

==Personal history==
Blair was born in Maysville, Missouri to James T. Blair and Grace (Ray) Blair. His father was a prominent lawyer in Springfield, Missouri who would later serve as an assistant attorney general for the state of Missouri and, in 1914, be appointed a judge to the Missouri Supreme Court. Blair Jr. attended the Jefferson City, Missouri public schools and Staunton Military Academy in Virginia before pursuing higher education at Southwest Missouri State Teachers College (now Missouri State University) and the University of Missouri. He earned his law degree in 1924 from Cumberland University in Tennessee. Blair married his wife Emilie Chorn of Kansas City in July 1926.

They were the parents of two children: a son, James T. Blair III, and daughter Mary Margaret. During World War II Blair served in the US Army Air Forces in the European Theater. He received the Air Medal, Legion of Merit, and Bronze Star among other awards as he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==Political history==
Blair first entered politics shortly after graduation from law school by running for and winning election as city attorney for Jefferson City in 1925. In 1928, Blair won election to the first of two consecutive terms in Missouri House of Representatives. Following his second term in the General Assembly, Blair left politics to focus on his private law practice until his service in World War II. Blair returned to politics in 1947 with his election as mayor of Jefferson City. His mayoral term was short-lived, however, as in 1948 he was elected Missouri&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor, a post he held until he assumed the office of governor, winning that race in November 1956.

As governor, Blair was known as a civil rights advocate, declaring to the General Assembly &quot;Always and everywhere I will identify myself with any victim of oppression or discrimination...and I will support him&quot;. This helped lead to the Missouri Commission on Human Rights in 1957. While in office, Blair was also an advocate of welfare reform and extending health insurance to the disabled. Under his governorship the first budget control and review office was established. Other highlights include a nursing home licensing law, establishing a Council on Higher Education, expansion of the Missouri Highway Patrol and setting of road speed limits, and setting up a state employee pension fund. At the time Missouri law prohibited a second consecutive term as governor, leading to Blair&#x27;s retirement from politics after leaving office in January 1961.

==Death==
James T. Blair&#x27;s retirement would be short-lived. On July 12, 1962, Blair and his wife were found dead in their suburban Jefferson City home due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Investigators theorized the home&#x27;s central air conditioning system sucked in exhaust fumes from a vehicle accidentally left running in the garage. Governor Blair and his wife were buried in the Riverview Cemetery in Jefferson City.

<text>Gerard Jennissen (born February 22, 1942) is an educator and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1995 to 2011.

The son of Johannes Jennissen and Elizabeth Houben, he was born in Slek-Echt, in the province of Limburg in the Netherlands. His family emigrated to Selnac, Saskatchewan in 1952, where his father worked as a farmer. Jennissen graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in 1966 with degrees in Arts and Education, and received a Master of Arts degree in Communication in 1969. He taught English at Rose Valley High School in Saskatchewan for three years, and worked for Frontier Collegiate Institute from 1972 to 1994. In 1970, he married Lisa Sonnen. He has also been involved in several peace and justice organizations operating in the third world.

Jennissen became involved in the New Democratic Party in the early 1960s, after hearing Tommy Douglas speak in Saskatchewan. He continued his NDP affiliation after moving to Manitoba.

In the 1995 election, Jennissen was elected to the Manitoba Legislature for the northern Manitoba constituency of Flin Flon, defeating Progressive Conservative Scott Merrell, 2732 votes to 2017. Also in 1995, he supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party.

He was re-elected by a wider margin in the 1999 election, and received over 73% support in the 2003 election. Jennissen was the NDP critic for Highways and Transportation between 1995 and 1999, but was not appointed to cabinet when the NDP formed government in 1999.

In 2000, he was appointed to the Manitoba Hydro Board. In 2003, he supported Bill Blaikie&#x27;s campaign to lead the federal NDP.

He was re-elected in the 2007 provincial election. Jennissen did not run for reelection in 2011.

<text>Etal Castle is a ruined medieval fortification in the village of Etal, Northumberland, England. It was built around 1341 by Robert Manners, and comprised a residential tower, a gatehouse and a corner tower, protected by a curtain wall. The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.

The castle passed into the hands of the Crown in 1547 and was garrisoned as part of the border defences, but fell into disrepair and was abandoned as a military fortification after 1603. In the 18th century it ceased to be used as a domestic dwelling and became ruinous. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the Joicey family, but managed by English Heritage. Open to the public, it is protected under UK law as an ancient monument and a Grade I listed building.

==History==
===14th–15th centuries===
Etal Castle was built around 1341 by Robert Manners in the village of Etal, after Robert was granted a licence to crenellate by King Edward III in order to defend the location against the Scots. The Manners family had owned the manor since at least 1232.
The earliest part of the castle was its residential tower. This tower may have been built around 1341 on the site of an older, unfortified house owned by the family on the same site, incorporating part of the structure into the new, crenellated tower. Alternatively, the central tower may have been built at some point between the late 13th and early 14th centuries, complete with crenellations, in which case the licence from Edward III served only to allow Manners to extend the perimeter fortifications. By the 1350s, the castle was surrounded by a manor which included mills for corn and fulling, lime kilns and coal mines.

Work continued under Robert&#x27;s son, John Manners, who inherited the property as a minor in 1354. In 1355, when Sir Edward de Letham acquired the wardship of the property, the site was described as a &quot;fortalice&quot;, a weakly defended location, but by 1368, when the wardship passed to Joan, his widow, it was considered to be a fully-fledged castle. De Letham was a powerful regional figure, and may have been granted the wardship by Edward III in order to retain his loyalty in the face of military advances by the Scots; he and his wife allegedly ran down the surrounding estate, resulting in a commission being established to investigate the abuses.
John Manners died in 1402, probably leaving the castle to his son, Robert, who in turn left the property to his own son, another John Manners. John was involved in a long-running feud with the neighbouring Heron family, who owned the neighbouring Ford Castle, and on 20 January 1428 there was a fight between the two sides outside Etal Castle, in which William Heron died. The precise events are unclear and formed the basis of a subsequent lawsuit, but John argued that William had assaulted the castle, during which attack he had died, and that John had no direct involvement in his death. William&#x27;s widow blamed John and his eldest son, also called John, for William&#x27;s death and demanded compensation. After arbitration by the Church, eventually John agreed to pay for 500 masses for William&#x27;s soul, and to give 250 marks to his widow.

In 1438, another of John Manners&#x27; sons, Robert, inherited the castle and the estates. The lands had fallen in value considerably over the preceding years, as a result of the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert&#x27;s son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother&#x27;s side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family around the end of the 15th century when the Manners moved closer to the royal court.

===16th century===

In the absence of the Manners, Etal Castle was managed by the Collingwood family, who gradually became the castle&#x27;s hereditary constables, renting the demesne lands on the estate from the family as well. The castle was heavily involved in the border wars with Scotland, usually holding a garrison of 100 men and forming an important strategic defensive location, one step removed from the fortifications along the border itself.

In August 1513, James IV of Scotland invaded England with a large army; equipped with modern artillery, he took the border castles of Norham and Wark, and then moved south against Etal Castle. Etal surrendered quickly in the hope of avoiding being pillaged by James&#x27; army, but nonetheless it was at least partially slighted - deliberately damaged to prevent it being used as a defence.

After the English victory at the Battle of Flodden the following month, the castle was retaken, garrisoned and used by Lord Dacre to store the captured Scottish artillery, under the guard of Sir Philip Tilney. Lord Dacre went on to use the castle extensively in 1515 and 1516. In 1541, a royal commission reported that the castle and its buildings were &quot;in very great decaye&quot;, recommending that the fortification should be repaired.

The Crown bought the castle from the Manners in 1547 in exchange for other estates in England, putting Sir John Elleker in charge of the property, along with a garrison of 100 horsemen and 200 foot soldiers. Within two years, however, the Collingwoods were once more acting as the castle constables, a position they would retain for the rest of the century. The castle remained important to the defence of the border but fell into in poor repair: in 1564 it was described as in poor condition, &quot;scant able to lodge the captain&quot;; in 1580 another report reiterated similar problems; and in 1584 commissioners wrote that the poor maintenance over many years had left it need of repairs in the order of £200.

===17th–21st centuries===
In 1603 James VI of Scotland inherited the kingdom of England, uniting the two thrones, and Etal Castle lost its military value and soon passed into private ownership. In 1636, the Earl of Suffolk sold it to a Scottish officer Sir Robert Carr, supposedly descended from Kerr of Greenhead, Roxburgh. It remained in the hands of the Carr family until the 19th century, by which time the castle had deteriorated. In the 18th century it ceased to be used as a residence, as the Carrs built a new manor house in the village in 1748. It remained in the hands of the Carrs until the 19th century.

The ruins were painted in watercolour by Thomas Girtin in 1797, based upon his visit to the castle in the autumn of 1796.

Lord Joicey bought the castle in 1908, and by 1922 the ruins had been cleaned of ivy and repointed. The castle was placed into the guardianship of the state in 1975, and archaeological excavations and surveys were carried out on the site in 1978, 1983, 1994 and 1998. In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage, and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and as an ancient monument.

==Architecture==
Etal Castle originally overlooked a bridge over the River Till, and was protected by the steep banks running to the river. The castle forms a rectangular enclosure, approximately , protected by a well-made, but relatively thin, stone curtain wall, mostly thick. Most of the wall above ground has since been destroyed, with only the foundations remaining.

The residential tower in the north-east corner was entered by a forebuilding, unusual in this region, 17 feet 6 inches by 7 feet 10 inches (5.33 by 2.39 m) in size and protected by a portcullis. Four storeys tall, each floor of the tower was reached by a spiral staircase and comprised two rooms, one large and one small chamber. The tower is built from sandstone; the forebuilding and uppermost floor are made of a lighter sandstone than the lower floors and may have been added retrospectively. The ground floor is and originally had a vaulted ceiling. The upper floors were well-lit with large, transomed windows, complete with window seats; the first and second floors were probably used by the Manners family and had large fireplaces, with the third floor used by the castle staff. The tower was possibly linked to a neighbouring hall complex by a doorway on the first floor, although any such complex has since been lost.

The gatehouse in the south-east corner is square, and its vaulted passageway was originally protected by a portcullis, gate and a drawbridge. On either side of the passageway were two vaulted guardrooms, long and up to wide. On the first floor, since lost, there was a large chamber, wide, with an ancillary room, square, and a doorway that led onto some form of forebuilding or platform. The gatehouse has what architectural historian Anthony Emery has described as &quot;flamboyant window tracing&quot;, and the Manners&#x27; coat of arms are carved above the entrance to the gatehouse.

The north-west corner tower is 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an entrance door on the east side, and originally had a loft floor. It remains uncertain if there was a second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a geophysical survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.

<doc id="967212" wikidata="Q5465504" url="?curid=967212" title="Biological patents in the United States">
<text>As with all utility patents in the United States, a biological patent provides the patent holder with the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the claimed invention or discovery in biology for a limited period of time - for patents filed after 1998, 20 years from the filing date.

Until recently, natural biological substances themselves could be patented (apart from any associated process or usage) in the United States if they were sufficiently &quot;isolated&quot; from their naturally occurring states. Prominent historical examples of such patents on isolated products of nature include adrenaline, insulin, vitamin B12, and gene patents. However, the US Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that mere isolation by itself is not sufficient for something to be deemed inventive subject matter.

==History==
The United States has been patenting chemical compositions based upon human products for over 100 years.
The first patent for a human product was granted on March 20, 1906, for a purified form of adrenaline. It was challenged and upheld in &quot;Parke-Davis v. Mulford&quot;. Judge Hand argued that natural substances when they are purified are more useful than the original natural substances.

The 1970s marked the first time when scientists patented methods on their biotechnological inventions with recombinant DNA. It was not until 1980 that patents for whole-scale living organisms were permitted. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot;, upheld the first patent on a newly created living organism, a bacterium for digesting crude oil in oil spills. The patent examiner for the United States Patent and Trademark Office had rejected the patent of a living organism, but Chakrabarty appealed. As a rule, raw natural material is generally rejected for patent approval by the USPTO. The Court ruled that as long as the organism is truly &quot;man-made&quot;, such as through genetic engineering, then it is patentable. Because the DNA of Chakrabarty&#x27;s organism was modified, it was patentable.

Since that 1980 court case, there have been many patents of genetically modified organisms. This includes bacteria (as just mentioned), viruses, seeds, plants, cells, and even non-human animals. Isolated and manipulated cells - even human cells - can also be patented. In 1998, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued a broad patent claiming primate (including human) embryonic stem cells, entitled &quot;Primate Embryonic Stem Cells&quot; (). On 13 March 2001, a second patent () was issued with the same title but focused on human embryonic stem cells. In another example, a genetically modified mouse, dubbed the Oncomouse, that is useful for studying cancer, was patented by Harvard University as .

Companies and organizations, like the University of California, have patented entire genomes.

==Food patents==
An early example of a food patent is the patent granted to RiceTec for basmati rice in 1997. In 1999, a patent was filed for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that was without crust. Agriculture giant Monsanto filed for a patent on certain pig genes in 2004.

==Gene patents==
A gene patent is a patent on a specific isolated gene sequence, its chemical composition, the processes for obtaining or using it, or a combination of such claims. With respect to subject matter, gene patents may be considered a subset of the broader category of biological patents.

Gene patents may claim the isolated natural sequences of genes, the use of a natural sequence for purposes such as diagnostic testing, or a natural sequence that has been altered by adding a promoter or other changes to make it more useful. In the United States, patents on genes have only been granted on isolated gene sequences with known functions, and these patents cannot be applied to the naturally occurring genes in humans or any other naturally occurring organism.

===Examples===

The &quot;Chakrabarty patent&quot;, owned by General Electric, was filed in 1972 and issued in 1981 after the Supreme Court decision discussed above. While not commercially important, this patent and the Supreme Court case &quot;opened the floodgates for protection of biotechnology-related inventions and helped spark the growth of an industry&quot;.

In 1978 University of California filed a patent application for the cDNA encoding human growth hormone, which issued in 1982 as U.S. Patent No. 4,363,877 and listed Howard M. Goodman, John Shine, and Peter H. Seeburg as inventors. University of California licensed its patent to Lilly, leading to extended litigation among University of California, Lilly, and Genentech; each of Lilly and Genentech had introduced recombinant human growth hormone drugs, which were among the first biotech drugs brought to market.

The &quot;Cohen/Boyer patents&quot; were invented by Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of University of California, San Francisco. The patents cover inventions for splicing genes to make recombinant proteins that are foundational to the biotechnology industry. Stanford managed the patents and licensed them nonexclusively and broadly, earning over $200 million for the universities.

The &quot;Axel Patents&quot; were invented by Richard Axel, Michael H. Wigler, and Saul J. Silverstein of Columbia University. These patents covered cotransformation, a form of transformation, another foundational method of biotechnology; Columbia licensed these patents nonexclusively and broadly and earned about $790 million.

Key methods to manipulate DNA to create monoclonal antibodies are covered by a thicket of patents, including the &quot;Winter patent&quot; was invented by Gregory P. Winter of the Medical Research Council which covers methods to make chimeric, humanized antibodies and has been licensed to about fifty companies. Abgenix owned a patent on methods of making transgenic mice lacking endogenous heavy chains. The &quot;Boss patent&quot; was owned by Celltech and covered methods of making recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments, together with vectors and host cells useful in these processes. Genentech owned the &quot;Old Cabilly&quot; patent that covered altered and native immunoglobulins prepared in recombinant cell culture, as well as the &quot;New Cabilly&quot; patent that covers artificial synthesis of antibody molecules. Medarex owned a patent that covered high affinity human antibodies from transgenic mice. These patents have been broadly licensed and have been the subject of litigation among patent holders and companies that have brought monoclonal antibody drugs to market.

A patent application for the isolated BRCA1 gene and cancer-promoting mutations, as well as methods to diagnose the likelihood of getting breast cancer, was filed by the University of Utah, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) and Myriad Genetics in 1994; over the next year, Myriad, in collaboration with investigators from Endo Recherche, Inc., HSC Research &amp; Development Limited Partnership, and University of Pennsylvania, isolated and sequenced the BRCA2 gene, and the first BRCA2 patent was filed in the U.S. by Myriad and other institutions in 1995. Myriad is the exclusive licensee of these patents and has enforced them in the US against clinical diagnostic labs. This means that legally all testing must be done through Myriad&#x27;s lab or by a lab which it had licensed. This business model led from Myriad being a startup in 1994 to being a publicly traded company with 1200 employees and about $500M in annual revenue in 2012; it also led to controversy and the Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics lawsuit mentioned below. The patents expire, starting in 2014.

===Myriad Genetics case===
&quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; was a 2013 case challenging the validity of gene patents in the United States, specifically challenging certain claims in issued patents owned or controlled by Myriad Genetics that covered isolated DNA sequences, methods to diagnose propensity to cancer by looking for mutated DNA sequences, and methods to identify drugs using isolated DNA sequences.

The case was originally heard in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled that all the challenged claims were not patentable subject matter. Myriad then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Circuit court overturned the previous decision in part, ruling that isolated DNA which does not exist alone in nature &quot;can&quot; be patented and that the drug screening claims were valid, and confirmed in part, finding the diagnostic claims unpatentable. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted cert and remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit did not change its opinion, so on September 25, 2012, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court with respect to the second Federal Circuit Decision.

On November 30, 2012, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the plaintiffs&#x27; appeal of the Federal Circuit&#x27;s ruling. In June 2013, in &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics&quot; (No. 12-398), the court unanimously ruled that, &quot;A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature and not patent eligible merely because it has been isolated,&quot; invalidating Myriad&#x27;s patents on the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. However, the Court also held synthesized DNA sequences, not occurring in nature, can still be eligible for patent protection.

==Controversy==
Controversy over biological patents occurs on many levels, driven by, for example, concern over the expense of patented medicines or diagnostics tests (against Myriad Genetics with respect to their breast cancer diagnostic test), concerns over genetically modified food which comes from patented genetically modified seeds as well as farmer&#x27;s rights to harvest and plant seeds from the crops, for example legal actions by Monsanto using its patents.

The patenting of organisms or extracts from indigenous plants or animals that are already known to local populations has been called biopiracy. Critics say that such patents deny local populations the right to use those inventions, for instance, to grow food.

In the United States, biological material derived from humans can be patented if it has been sufficiently transformed. In litigation that was famous at the time, a cancer patient, John Moore, sued the University of California. Cancer cells had been removed from Moore as part of his medical treatment; these cells were studied and manipulated by researchers. The resulting cells were &quot;immortalized&quot; and were patented by the university as and have become widely used research tools. The subject of the litigation was the financial gain that the university and researchers achieved by additionally charging money to companies by licensing the cell line.

Michael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg are academic law professors who believe that biological patents are creating a &quot;tragedy of the anticommons,&quot; &quot;in which people underuse scarce resources because too many owners can block each other&quot;. Others claim that patents have not created this &quot;anticommons&quot; effect on research, based on surveys of scientists.

Professional societies of pathologists have criticized patents on disease genes and exclusive licenses to perform DNA diagnostic tests. In the 2009 Myriad case, doctors and pathologists complained that the patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes prevented patients from receiving second opinions on their test results. Pathologists complained that the patent prevented them from carrying out their medical practice of doing diagnostic tests on patient samples and interpreting the results.

Another example is a series of lawsuits filed by the Alzheimer&#x27;s Institute of America (AIA) starting in 2003 with the last ending in 2013, concerning a gene patent it controlled on the Swedish mutation and transgenic mice carrying it; the mutation that is important in Alzheimers. The mice are widely used in Alzheimer&#x27;s research, both by academic scientists doing basic research and by companies that use the mice to test products in development. Two of these suits are directed to companies that were started based on inventions made at universities (Comentis and Avid), and in each of those cases, the university was sued along with the company. While none of the suits target universities that are conducting basic research using the mice, one of the suits is against Jackson Labs, a nonprofit company that provides transgenic mice to academic and commercial researchers and is an important repository of such mice. Ultimately all the suits failed; the suit against Jackson Labs failed after the NIH granted it protection as a government contractor.

<text>Michelle Stafford (born September 14, 1965) is an American actress, screenwriter and producer. She currently plays Phyllis Summers on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, for which she has won three Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2013, Stafford created and starred in her own comedy web series, &quot;The Stafford Project&quot;. She also played Nina Reeves on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2014-2019.

==Early life==
Stafford was born in Chicago, Illinois. Her parents moved her and her older sister, Janine, to Montrose, California, where she was raised. After graduating from high school, Stafford chased after her dream of modeling.

==Career==
In 1990 Stafford was cast in Fox soap opera &quot;Tribes&quot;. The show was canceled after 3-month airing on Fox. She later appeared in two plays directed by Charles Durning in Los Angeles stage, and co-starred in several small films.

In October 1994, Stafford began what was supposed to be a short term role of Phyllis Summers on the American CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; however, her work impressed the producers and she was placed on contract. In 1997, Stafford left the series to pursue other career opportunities, and she was replaced by Sandra Nelson. In 1997 she was cast in Aaron Spelling primetime soap opera &quot;Pacific Palisades&quot; as lead character, but show was canceled after 13 episodes. She later guest-starred in &quot;Two Guys and a Girl&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;JAG&quot;. In film, Stafford appeared in 1999 thriller &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; opposite Ashley Judd.

In July 2000, Stafford was brought back to the soap opera by former head writer Kay Alden. From December 2006 to February 2007, Stafford played dual roles on &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;, portraying Sheila Carter, formerly played by Kimberlin Brown (Sheila had plastic surgery to look like Phyllis). In May 2013, it was announced that Stafford would be exiting the soap opera after sixteen years in the role. Stafford later confirmed that her final scenes would air sometime that August. Stafford exited the series on August 2, 2013.

In 2004, Stafford was a hockey correspondent for &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;. Stafford starred in Lifetime movie &quot;Like Mother, Like Daughter&quot; in 2007. In 2007, Stafford appeared on Tyra Banks&#x27; talk show to help Tyra through &quot;soap opera school.&quot; In 2012 she appeared as Lauren on the web series &quot;The Grove&quot;, created by Crystal Chappell. She also guest-starred in &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Charmed&quot;, and &quot;Ringer&quot;. She subsequently launched her web series, &quot;The Stafford Project&quot;, based on her personal life and struggles, with the first episode premiering on her YouTube Channel on August 5, 2013. The series received positive reviews from critics. Michael Logan of &quot;TV Guide&quot; appreciated the web series, calling it &quot;terrific and audacious&quot; and saying that &quot;there&#x27;s never a dull moment in the life of Michelle Stafford&quot;. Jamey Giddens of the entertainment website Zap2it said that Stafford is &quot;as viable and fiery as ever&quot;, calling &quot;The Stafford Project&quot; &quot;insanely-funny&quot;.

In 2014, Stafford returned to daytime television with the role of Nina Clay, the wife of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) on the ABC soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Stafford&#x27;s long-rumored addition to the cast was made official when her character Nina, the presumed-dead wife of Silas, suddenly appeared at the very end of the episode on May 1, 2014. In 2015, she co-starred alongside Tom Sizemore in the independent film &quot;Durant&#x27;s Never Closes&quot;.

In 2016, Stafford launched a skincare product line called Skin Nation. The products are said to be organic, natural, gluten free, and certified cruelty-free by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In 2019, it was announced that she would leave &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Nina Reeves and reprise her role of Phyllis Summers on &quot;The Young &amp; the Restless&quot;.

==Personal life==
Stafford&#x27;s first child, a daughter, Natalia Scout Lee Stafford, was born via a gestational surrogate in December 2009. In October 2015, Stafford had a second child, a son named Jameson Jones Lee Stafford.

She is a member of the Church of Scientology.

<text>The Auburn Tigers are the athletic teams representing Auburn University, a public four-year university located in Auburn, Alabama, United States. The Auburn Tigers compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC).

==Sports sponsored==
Auburn sponsors 21 varsity teams in 15 sports and competes in the Southeastern Conference.

===Football===
Auburn claims five national championships: 1913 (chosen by one selector in 1999), 1957, 1983, 1993 (one of four co-champions by one selector), and 2010. Three Auburn players, Pat Sullivan in 1971, Bo Jackson in 1985, and Cam Newton in 2010 have won the Heisman Trophy. The Trophy&#x27;s namesake, John Heisman, coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school that Heisman coached at (among others, Georgia Tech and Clemson) that has produced a Heisman Trophy winner. Auburn&#x27;s Jordan–Hare Stadium has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the tenth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA as of January 2011. 
Auburn played the first football game in the Deep South in 1892 against the University of Georgia at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. The Tigers&#x27; first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth Bacardi Bowl played in Havana, Cuba. AU Football has won 12 conference championships (8 SEC), has had seven perfect seasons, and since the division of the conference in 1992, six outright western division championships (1997, 2000, 2004, 2010, 2013, 2017) along with three additional co-championships. Auburn plays archrival Alabama each year in a game known as the Iron Bowl. In the overall series with Alabama, Auburn trails Alabama 42–35–1, despite holding an 18–14 advantage in games played since 1982. Of the 14 SEC member universities, Auburn currently ranks 5th in the number of SEC football championships, and has won the most SEC titles of any program in the last decade.

Auburn completed the 2004 football season with an unblemished 13–0 record winning the SEC championship, their first conference title since 1989 and their first outright title since 1987. However, this achievement was somewhat overshadowed by the Tigers being left out of the BCS championship game in deference to two other undefeated, higher ranked teams, USC and Oklahoma. The 2004 team was led by quarterback Jason Campbell (Washington Redskins), running backs Carnell Williams (Tampa Bay Buccaneers) and Ronnie Brown (Miami Dolphins), and cornerback Carlos Rogers (Washington Redskins).

Auburn completed the 2010 football season with a perfect record of 13–0 winning the SEC championship when they defeated the University of South Carolina 56–17, which set an SEC Championship Game record for most points scored and largest margin of victory. The Tigers went on to defeat the Oregon Ducks 22–19 in their first appearance in the BCS National Championship Game on January 10, 2011, in Glendale, Arizona. The 2010 team was led by quarterback Cam Newton, who became the Heisman trophy winner of 2010 along with multiple other awards.

Auburn completed the 2013 regular season with an 11–1 record by knocking off then #1 Alabama. Auburn went on to defeat #5 Missouri 59–42 in the 2013 SEC Championship Game to claim its eighth SEC championship. Auburn faced #1 Florida State in the 2014 BCS National Championship Game at the Rose Bowl, falling to the Seminoles in the final seconds, 31–34. The Tigers finished the season with a 12–2 record and ranked #2 in the final AP and Coaches polls.

===Swimming and diving===
In the last decade under former head coach David Marsh, Auburn&#x27;s swimming and diving program became a virtual dynasty in the SEC and the NCAA winning five consecutive NCAA men&#x27;s championships from 2003 through 2007 and women&#x27;s championships in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. The Auburn men have won the SEC Championship 14 out of the last 15 years and also won national championships in 1997, 1999, and 2009. The Auburn men won their 13th consecutive SEC Title in 2008, while the Auburn women took home their fifth SEC Championship in the last six years. The Auburn men&#x27;s 44 consecutive, five-year, dual-meet win record came to an end on January 11, 2007, when they lost to Texas 130–113, exactly five years to the date of their last loss in 2001, also to Texas.

Auburn swimmers have represented the U.S. and several other countries in recent Olympics. Auburn&#x27;s most famous swimmer is Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines, winner of three gold medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Auburn&#x27;s most successful female Olympic swimmer is Kirsty Coventry (swimming for her home country of Zimbabwe) who won a gold, silver and bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

Marsh left Auburn after the 2007 season to become the Head Elite Coach and CEO of the United States Olympic Committee Center of Excellence in Charlotte, North Carolina and was succeeded by former Auburn head coach Richard Quick who led Stanford and Texas to 12 NCAA titles in two decades of coaching between 1984 and 2005.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===
The Auburn men&#x27;s basketball team has enjoyed off-and-on success over the years. Its best known alumnus is Charles Barkley.

Other NBA players from Auburn are Chuck Person, Wesley Person, Chris Porter, Marquis Daniels, Moochie Norris, and Pat Burke.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
===Baseball===
===Softball===
===Men&#x27;s golf===
The men&#x27;s golf team has won five SEC Championships: 1976, 1981, 2002, 2018, and 2024. Chip Spratlin claimed the 1995 NCAA Championship and the men&#x27;s golf team won the 2024 NCAA Championship. Jackson Koivun was the recipient of the 2024 Fred Haskins Award, the first in Auburn history and first freshman to be awarded since 2012.

===Women&#x27;s golf===
Auburn&#x27;s women&#x27;s golf team has risen to be extremely competitive in the NCAA in recent years. Since 1999, they hold an 854–167–13 (.826 win percentage) record. The team has been in five NCAA finals and finished second in 2002 and then third in 2005. The program has a total of nine SEC Championships (1989, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2020). The nine titles is third all-time for women&#x27;s golf. In October 2005, Auburn was named the #3 team nationally out of 229 total teams since 1999 by &quot;GolfWeek&quot; magazine. Auburn&#x27;s highest finish in the NCAA tournament was a tie for 2nd in 2002.

Since 1996, the team has been headed by Coach Kim Evans, a 1981 alumna, who has turned the program into one of the most competitive in the nation. Coach Evans has helped develop All-Americans, SEC Players of the Year as well as three SEC Freshman of the Year. She has led the Tigers to eight-straight NCAA appearances. She is by far the winningest Coach in Auburn Golf History, having over 1,100 wins and winning six of Auburn&#x27;s seven total SEC Titles. Evans was named National Coach of the Year in 2003 and has coached 8 individual All-Americans while at Auburn.

===Women&#x27;s soccer===
Auburn Soccer has been one of the top programs of the SEC. The team started in 1993 and after some growing pains is now a constant player in the SEC Conference championship race. Auburn won four straight SEC West division titles between 2001–2004 and a fifth in 2006. They won the regular season SEC title in 2002.

The 2006 Auburn soccer season saw the Tigers playing only five seniors and 13 freshmen who saw significant playing time. Despite the youth, Auburn went on to an 11–5–3 including a 5–3–3 mark in the SEC to retake the SEC Western division title. The Season ended on a 3–1 loss in the first round of the NCAA tournament to California in Tallahassee, Florida.

The 2011 Auburn soccer team defeated Florida, 3–2 to win the SEC Tournament on 11/6/11.

===Equestrian===
Women&#x27;s equestrian debuted in 1996 and became the school&#x27;s 21st varsity sport five years later. The team has been led by Greg Williams since its debut. In 2004, the team won its first championship at the Southern Equestrian Championships, which started in 2003. In 2006, the team won its first Varsity Equestrian National Championship, capturing Auburn&#x27;s first national title outside of football and swimming and diving. The team earned its first Hunt Seat national title in 2008, while the Tigers finished third in the overall standings. The team won their second national championship in 2011, their third in 2013, fourth in 2016 and fifth in 2018.

Although equestrian is not yet sanctioned by the NCAA, Auburn competes with 19 other Division I schools, including SEC foes Georgia and South Carolina. The NCAA classified equestrian as an emerging sport in 1998. Forty Division I and Division II schools are required for the sport to be recognized by the NCAA. Currently, there are 23 programs, and more are expected to be added each year.

===Track and field===
Auburn&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Track and Field won the 2006 National NCAA Outdoor title convincingly by outscoring USC 57–38.50. The track title was the 4th National Championship won by Auburn in 2006. In Outdoor Track and Field, the previous highest finish for the Women was 14th in 2002 and 2003. The Auburn men have finished second in the NCAA Outdoor championships twice in 2003 and 2008. The men have earned two third-place finishes in 2000 and 2007. The Auburn team was coached for 28 years by Mel Rosen, for whom the Hutsell-Rosen Track was in part named in 2006.

===Women&#x27;s gymnastics===

Since its reinstatement in 1975, the Tigers women&#x27;s gymnastics team has made two appearances in the Super Six.

==Notable non-varsity sports==

===Wrestling===
At the conclusion of the 1980–1981 NCAA Wrestling season, Auburn University became the first SEC team to place Top 10 in the country. Coached by Ohio wrestling legend Tom Milkovich, Auburn claimed the SEC title en route to a historic season boasting 3 All-Americans and 6 NCAA qualifiers. However, with the emergence of Title IX and the decline of wrestling in the SEC, Auburn found itself without a varsity program after the historic 1980–81 season. Since 1997 Auburn has competed in the National Collegiate Wrestling Association (NCWA) as the Auburn University Wrestling Club and boasts 24 All-Americans and a National Champion, with six Top-10 finishes at the Division 1 National Championships. Auburn, headed by President Justin King, looks to further this success in its 26th year of membership in the NCWA.

===Cycling===

The Auburn Flyers are the premier cycling club in the Auburn / Opelika area for college students. With frequent rides and races, the team caters to all levels of riders, entry to advanced. The Flyers members have been riding anywhere from months to years, with all levels of competition represented by the team.

The team fields both road and mountain bike teams in the Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference within USAC Collegiate Cycling. Other teams within their conference include traditional Auburn rivals Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Florida.

====Southeastern Collegiate Cycling Conference Champions====
* 2013 (B Category Omnium) - Nathan Spence
* 2014 (B Category Omnium) - Frank Whittle
* 2016 (A Category Omnium) - Nathan Spence

===Rugby===
The Auburn University Rugby Football Club was founded in 1973. Auburn plays Division 1 college rugby in the Southeastern Collegiate Rugby Conference against traditional SEC rivals such as Alabama and Georgia. Auburn rugby is one of only two club sports at Auburn with an endowment fund, resulting in the university allocating additional resources to rugby.

==Aubie==

Aubie is an anthropomorphic tiger and the official mascot of Auburn University. Aubie&#x27;s existence began as a cartoon character that first appeared on the Auburn/Hardin-Simmons football program cover on October 3, 1959. &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot; artist Phil Neel created the cartoon tiger, who continued to appear on Auburn program covers for 18 years. Aubie&#x27;s look changed through the years. In 1962, he began to stand upright and in the next year, 1963, wore clothes for the first time—a blue tie, polkadot pants, and straw hat. Aubie&#x27;s appearances on game programs occurred during a successful period in head football coach Ralph &quot;Shug&quot; Jordan&#x27;s teams. The Tigers were victorious in the first nine games which had Aubie on the cover and in his first six years, Auburn posted a 23–2–1 home record. Auburn&#x27;s home record during the eighteen years Aubie served as Cover Tiger was 63–16–2. Aubie&#x27;s regular appearance on the game program cover ended on October 23, 1976, when Auburn beat Florida State, 31–19, but Aubie returned to Auburn&#x27;s cover in the Iron Bowl against Alabama on November 30, 1991, Auburn&#x27;s last home game at Birmingham&#x27;s Legion Field.

In 1979, Aubie came to life at the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament. James Lloyd, Auburn spirit director for the Student Government Association, with help from the Auburn Alumni Association, contacted Brooks-Van Horn Costumes in New York, N.Y. The company was provided with copies of the 1961 Auburn-Alabama and 1962 Auburn-Georgia Tech game programs to use for reference in creating a costume of the cartoon character. The firm, which also provided costumes for Walt Disney, designed and produced a Tiger costume for $1,350. Individual contributions from various Auburn clubs, alumni and friends helped pay for the first costume.

Aubie was introduced at the Birmingham–Jefferson Civic Center on February 28, 1979, and helped lead first-year Auburn coach Sonny Smith&#x27;s team to an upset of Vanderbilt in his first appearance as a live Tiger mascot. The following day, Aubie returned to the arena and the Tigers beat Georgia in the longest game in SEC tournament history, four overtimes. Before the weekend was complete, Aubie helped lead the ninth-place team in the regular season to the semifinals of the tournament.

Aubie has won a record eleven mascot national championships — more than any other mascot in the United States (1991, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2021, and 2024). Aubie was named the 2014 Capital One Mascot of the Year and was among the first three college mascots inducted to the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Traditions==
===Tiger Walk===
Before each Auburn home football game, thousands of Auburn fans line Donahue Avenue to cheer on the team as they walk from the Auburn Athletic Complex to Jordan–Hare Stadium. The tradition began in the 1960s when groups of kids would walk up the street to greet the team and get autographs. During the tenure of coach Doug Barfield, the coach urged fans to come out and support the team, and thousands did. Auburn is the first known school to conduct an organized procession of players into the stadium. Today the team, led by the coaches, walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk. The largest Tiger Walk occurred on December 2, 1989, before the first ever home football game against rival Alabama—the Iron Bowl. On that day, an estimated 20,000 fans packed the one block section of road leading to the stadium. According to former athletic director David Housel, Tiger Walk has become &quot;the most copied tradition in all of college football.&quot; As it grew in popularity, the Tiger Walk has become a fixture for road games. Fans will gather at visiting stadiums and cheer the team on from the buses into the stadium.

===Toomer&#x27;s Corner===

The intersection of Magnolia Avenue and College Street in Auburn, which marks the transition from downtown Auburn to the university campus, is known as Toomer&#x27;s Corner. It is named for businessman and State Senator Sheldon Toomer who founded the Bank of Auburn on the corner of Magnolia Avenue and College Street in 1907. Toomer&#x27;s Drugs is a small business on the corner that has been an Auburn landmark for over 130 years.

====Toomer&#x27;s Trees and the Rolling Tradition====
Hanging over the corner were two massive southern live oak trees, and anytime anything good happened concerning Auburn, toilet paper could usually be found hanging from the trees. Also known as &quot;rolling the corner&quot; or &quot;rolling Toomer&#x27;s&quot;, this tradition is thought to have originated in the 1950s to celebrate away victories; however, in recent years it has become a way to celebrate anything good that happens concerning Auburn. On January 10, 2011, when Auburn football won the 2011 BCS National Championship Game, a celebration was held at the corner which involved the traditional papering. The trees were removed on April 23, 2013, due to poisoning in 2010. New trees were planted in their place in 2015, and were open to rolling in August 2023.

====Toomer&#x27;s Trees poisoned====
On January 27, 2011, a man calling himself &quot;Al&quot; and claiming to be from Dadeville, a town thirty minutes from Auburn, called into Paul Finebaum&#x27;s sports talk radio show. &quot;Al&quot; claimed to have poisoned the Toomer&#x27;s trees with an herbicide called Spike 80DF (Tebuthiuron) the weekend following the 2010 Iron Bowl. He said he did this in retaliation for photos that he saw in an article in &quot;The Birmingham News&quot; that depicted Auburn fans rolling Toomer&#x27;s Corner after announcement of former University of Alabama head-coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant&#x27;s death in 1983 as well as of an Auburn #2 (number of 2010 Auburn quarterback Cam Newton) Under Armour T-shirt taped to Bryant&#x27;s statue earlier in the 2010 season. He ended his call by saying, &quot;Roll damn Tide!&quot; An exhaustive search of newspapers found no evidence of Toomer&#x27;s Corner being rolled upon Bryant&#x27;s death.

The caller&#x27;s claims prompted Auburn to take soil samples. On February 16, 2011, Auburn officials announced that the live oak trees at Toomer&#x27;s Corner had been poisoned with a large quantity of Spike 80DF, a herbicide governed by Alabama state agricultural laws and the Environmental Protection Agency; Spike 80DF was not used by Auburn University. Tests of soil samples showed the lowest levels of Spike 80DF to be 0.78ppm, which experts stated was enough to be a &quot;very lethal dose.&quot; The highest levels of concentration were measured to be 51ppm. Gary Keever, an Auburn University professor of horticulture and a member of Auburn&#x27;s Tree Preservation Committee has said &quot;[Spike 80DF] is extremely active and persistent [and] it&#x27;s likely to be in the soil for 3 to 5 years.&quot; Concerns about the poisoned groundwater were dropped following further soil analysis, but later the soil from Toomer&#x27;s Corner was completely excavated and replaced with untainted soil.

Auburn University and city police both launched investigations into the matter. Finebaum later reported that Federal authorities were also involved due to concerns of the herbicide having entered the groundwater. Both Auburn University President Jay Gogue and University of Alabama Athletic Director Mal Moore condemned this act.

Police traced the call to the home of Harvey Updyke Jr. of Dadeville. Updyke, a retired Texas state trooper, was taken into custody at 1:26 am CST on February 17, 2011, and charged with one count of criminal mischief, a class C felony in Alabama. On March 22, 2013, he received a 3-year split sentence, which includes 6 months&#x27; incarceration and jail credit for time already served. Upon release, Updyke was sentenced to 5 years&#x27; supervised probation with a 7 p.m. curfew. He was also prohibited from attending any collegiate sports event and banned from Auburn University property. The efforts made by the university to save the trees proved unsuccessful. &quot;It came to a point where we realized it wasn&#x27;t going to work, and the amount of poison in the ground was such that the trees were not going to survive,&quot; said Mike Clardy, Auburn University&#x27;s Communications Director. The oak trees at Toomer&#x27;s Corner were removed on April 23, 2013. On November 8, 2013, Circuit Judge Jacob A. Walker III ruled that Updyke (who had moved to Louisiana) owed Auburn University $796,731.98 in restitution, to be paid in installments of $500 per month. Auburn University sought more than $1 million in damages, the greater part of which was based on a soil-analysis estimate of $521,396.74 by the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries. Updyke was released to 5 years&#x27; supervised probation after having served 104 days of incarceration. He died from natural causes on July 30, 2020, at the age of 71.

On February 14, 2015, two 35-foot-tall live oaks were planted to replace the original oaks. The university requested that fans not roll the trees with toilet paper until the Fall 2016 season, to allow the trees to acclimate to their new environment. Despite this precaution, one of the two replacement trees died within a few months and was scheduled to be replaced yet again. Wood from the original oaks was fashioned into memorabilia, the profits going to a scholarship fund. The replacement tree fronting Magnolia Avenue was set on fire on September 25, 2016, during celebrations for Auburn&#x27;s victory against LSU the previous night. As of October 2016, an assessment of the tree&#x27;s health revealed that 60–70% of the canopy was dead, and prospects for the tree&#x27;s survival were not favorable. The other tree fronting College Street, while not damaged by the fire, had failed to become properly established. In February 2017, two 30-foot-tall live oaks were planted to replace the two previous failing trees.

===&quot;War Eagle&quot;===
There are many stories surrounding the origins of Auburn&#x27;s battle cry, &quot;War Eagle.&quot; The most popular account involves the first Auburn football game in 1892 between Auburn and the University of Georgia. According to the story, in the stands that day was an old Civil War soldier with an eagle that he had found injured on a battlefield and kept as a pet. The eagle broke free and began to soar over the field, and Auburn began to march toward the Georgia end zone. The crowd began to chant &quot;War Eagle&quot; as the eagle soared. After Auburn won the game, the eagle crashed to the field and died, but according to the legend, his spirit lives on every time an Auburn man or woman yells &quot;War Eagle!&quot; The battle cry also functions as a greeting for those associated with the university. For many years, a live golden eagle has embodied the spirit of this tradition. The eagle was once housed on campus in The Eagle&#x27;s Cage, but the aviary was taken down and the eagle moved to the nearby raptor center.

===Wreck Tech Pajama Parade===
The Wreck Tech Pajama Parade originated in 1896, when a group of mischievous Auburn ROTC cadets, determined to show up the better-known engineers from Georgia Tech, sneaked out of their dorms the night before the football game between Auburn and Tech and greased the railroad tracks. According to the story, the train carrying the Georgia Tech team slid through town and didn&#x27;t stop until it was halfway to the neighboring town of Loachapoka, Alabama, The Georgia Tech team was forced to walk the five miles back to Auburn and, not surprisingly, were rather weary at the end of their journey. This likely contributed to their 45–0 loss. While the railroad long ago ceased to be the way teams traveled to Auburn and students never greased the tracks again, the tradition continues in the form of a parade through downtown Auburn. Students parade through the streets in their pajamas and organizations build floats. This tradition was renewed in 2005 with Georgia Tech returning to Auburn&#x27;s schedule after nearly two decades of absence.

===Rivals===
Auburn&#x27;s two traditional rivals are the University of Alabama and the University of Georgia. The stretch of games, at the end of the season, against these two schools is known as &quot;Amen Corner&quot;. The Alabama Crimson Tide is the most heated rival, and this rivalry is considered to be one of the most intense in the country. Competitions between the schools are known as the Iron Bowl. Alabama holds the all-time edge with a record of 50 wins, 37 losses and 1 tie.

Georgia and Auburn compete in the Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry, dating back to 1892. The game was played in Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Georgia leads the series 64-56–8 as of the end of the 2023 season. It is one of the longest running and most played series in the NCAA.

Auburn also has a heated rivalry with the LSU Tigers, commonly referred to as the Tiger Classic. The two share more than just a nickname, as they have both enjoyed success in the SEC&#x27;s Western Division. Auburn or LSU won at least a share of the SEC Western Division championship eight times between 2000 and 2011, and appeared in the SEC Championship game in seven of those years. Auburn won it outright in 2000, 2004, and 2010, LSU won it outright in 2007, 2011, and LSU won tiebreakers against Auburn in 2001 and 2005, and against Ole Miss in 2003. The only four times Auburn or LSU did not go to Atlanta during that span was 2002 when Arkansas won the three-way tie breaker with the two Tiger teams, in 2006 when Arkansas made it to Atlanta with a win over Auburn, and 2008 and 2009 when Alabama won the division.

Some of Auburn&#x27;s former rivals included the Florida Gators, the Tennessee Volunteers, the Tulane Green Wave, and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, each of which was mitigated (or, in the case of Georgia Tech, ended) with the SEC expansion and division restructuring, as well as past long series with the Clemson Tigers, the Texas Longhorns, and the Florida State Seminoles.

While basketball does not enjoy the same popularity as football at Auburn, the Iron Bowl of Basketball is very competitive. It is also popular for the halftime ceremony in which the Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Award is awarded to the school that won the football matchup earlier that academic year.

The baseball team also has in-state rivalries with the Samford Bulldogs and Troy Trojans.

====Swimming and diving====
Auburn&#x27;s swimming and diving team has a fierce rivalry with Texas, as the two have combined for 17 NCAA National Titles since 1981 (9 for Texas, 8 for Auburn) and between 1999 and 2007 won every national title awarded. The two regularly face-off in a meet during the regular season, Auburn&#x27;s men own a 12–9 record over the Longhorns. The women just recently began an annual series, with the Tigers winning the series so far 3–1. Texas was the only team to beat the Auburn men between 2001 and 2007.

<doc id="967234" wikidata="Q3403001" url="?curid=967234" title="Lanercost Priory">
<text>Lanercost Priory was founded by Robert de Vaux between 1165 and 1174, the most likely date being 1169, to house Augustinian canons. The priory is situated at the village of Lanercost, Cumbria, England, within sight of Naworth Castle, with which it had close connections. The &quot;Lanercost Chronicle&quot;, a thirteenth-century history of England and the Wars of Scottish Independence, was compiled by the monks of the priory.

It is now open to the public and in the guardianship of English Heritage.

==Early years==
The foundation date was traditionally 1169, but can only be dated definitely between 1165 and 1174 on the evidence of charters. The dedication is to Mary Magdalene, unusual in the region.

It would seem the arrangements for founding the Priory were well advanced by the time of the foundation charter, as opposed to the more gradual process at Wetheral and St Bees priories. Robert de Vaux gave the land of Lanercost &quot;between the ancient wall and the Irthing and between Burth and Poltros, the vill of Walton by stated bounds, the church of that vill with the chapel of &#x27;Treverman,&#x27; the churches of Irthington, Brampton, Carlaton and Farlam&quot;. The charter of foundation states that the benefaction was made for the sake of Henry II, and for the health of the souls of his father Hubert and his mother Grace.

Soon after the foundation of the house, Robert de Vaux granted to the canons the right of free election, so that when the lord prior died the person on whom the choice of the canons or the greater part of them fell should be elected in his place.

The bulk of the church building dates from the late 13th century, though there is evidence of earlier work. The Priory buildings were constructed, at least in part, from stones derived from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, including a number of Roman inscriptions that were built into its fabric.

==Visitors and raiders==
The proximity to Scotland inevitably had an effect on the fortunes of the priory, and it was a target of Scots attacks in retaliation for English raids. This became acute after the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence. In 1296 the Scottish army encamped at Lanercost after burning Hexham priory and Lambley nunnery. The Scots were interrupted before the damage could become great, and they retreated through Nicolforest, having burnt some houses of the monastery but not the church. Similar depredations under Wallace continued the next year and led to calls for reprisals from the English.
Edward I made several visits to the priory in the latter part of his reign. In the autumn of 1280 he visited in the company of Queen Eleanor of Castile on his way to Newcastle. The canons met him at the gate in their copes, and although staying only a few days, he found time to take 200 stags and hinds while hunting in Inglewood forest. In 1300, on his way to the siege of Caerlaverock Castle, Edward stayed at Lanercost for a short while.

Edward&#x27;s last visit was in 1306, travelling in a horse litter owing to age and illness, and accompanied by Queen Margaret of France, his second wife. He arrived at Michaelmas and his stay extended until the following Easter, a duration of 6 months which put a huge burden upon the resources of the priory. It was while Edward was at Lanercost that the brothers of Robert de Brus and other Scottish captives were sent to Carlisle for execution by his order.

This last royal visit depleted the reserves of the priory, and the canons begged him for recompense, but a deal to acquire the church of &#x27;Hautwyselle,&#x27; worth about 100 marks a year, fell through. However the king granted the appropriation of the churches of Mitford in Northumberland and Carlatton in Cumberland, for the relief of the Priory. In a letter to the Pope, Edward gave his reasons for generosity being the special devotion he felt to St Mary Magdalene, his long stay due to illness, and making good the damage of the Scots. Edward died shortly afterwards at Burgh by Sands in July 1307, whilst still campaigning against the Scots.
In August 1311, Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, came with his army and made it his headquarters for three days, &quot;committing infinite evils&quot; and imprisoning some canons, though later letting them free. By contrast in 1328, in fulfilment of the treaty between the Bruce and Edward III, a mutual interchange of good offices took place between the priory of Lanercost and Kelso Abbey in respect of their common revenues out of the church of Lazonby. 
Later though, in 1346, David II ransacked the conventual buildings and desecrated the church. Fresh from the overthrow of Liddel he &quot;entered the holy place with haughtiness, threw out the vessels of the temple, stole the treasures, broke the doors, took the jewels, and destroyed everything they could lay hands on&quot;. As late as 1386, one of the priors was taken prisoner by the Scots and ransomed for a fixed sum of money and four score quarters of corn.

The fortunes of the priory were linked to the state of warfare and raids on the border. The priory was in relatively affluent circumstances before the outbreak of the war of Independence in 1296, and the annual revenue of the house was returned at £74 12s 6d in the 1291 valuation of Pope Nicholas IV. But by the taxation of 1318, the value had fallen almost to nothing.

==The parish church==
Lanercost Priory was dissolved in 1538 by Henry VIII, and the conventual buildings were stripped of their roofs, excepting the church building which continued in use as the parish church. In the late 17th century, as the nave deteriorated, the congregation used just the north aisle which had been re-roofed. 
In 1747, the nave was re-roofed, but by 1847 the Priory was in a state of disrepair to the extent that the east end roof collapsed. However, by 1849, The church was in use again after a major restoration by Anthony Salvin. In the 1870s, there was further restoration by the Carlisle architect C. J. Ferguson.

At the Dissolution, ownership had passed to the Dacre family, and then in the early 18th century to the Howards. In 1929, the Priory ruins were put into public ownership, and today they are managed by English Heritage.

==Architectural notes==

The nave has an aisle to the north but a large wall to the south with no aisle, where it abuts the cloister. The impressive ruined chancel and crossing of &quot;ca.&quot; 1220–1230 are in a good state of preservation; as high as the eaves, and would only require a roof and windows to be restored to the original condition. The oldest masonry is in the south transept, and dates from the late 12th century. The cloister and monastic buildings have been largely dismantled, except for the west range, which was made into a house by Sir Thomas Dacre in the 16th century. 
The statue of St Mary Magdalene, given by King Edward I, still survives in a niche high up on the west front. A dossal – an embroidered wall hanging – designed by William Morris in 1881, underwent restoration before being rehung behind the priory altar in 2013–14.

==Memorials==
The priory has an unusual medieval stone carving called the Lanercost Cross with an inscription dating back to 1214. Originally the cross was set just
outside the entrance to the church. Today, the stump of the cross remains, but the main shaft is housed inside the priory.
In the churchyard is the tomb of Thomas Addison, scientist and physician. In the nave is a memorial to the Reverend Henry Whitehead, former vicar of Lanercost, best known for his pioneering epidemiological work with John Snow on cholera.

Humphrey Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre, and his widow Mabel were both buried at the Priory in the 15th century, as is Thomas Dacre, 2nd Baron Dacre.

<doc id="967253" wikidata="Q1362426" url="?curid=967253" title="Peugeot 204">
<text>The Peugeot 204 is a small family car produced by the French manufacturer Peugeot between 1965 and 1976.

The 204, known in development as Project D12, was available in many body styles including a sedan/saloon/berline, convertible/cabriolet, hatchback/coupe, estate/wagon, and a van. It was launched in Paris, France, on 23 April 1965 and became the best-selling car in France from 1969 to 1971.

==Engine==
The 204 used a front-wheel drive layout and was launched on 20 April 1965 with a single overhead cam 1130 cc petrol engine (the maximum allowed for the 6CV &#x27;car tax&#x27; class in France). In September 1975, less than a year before production ceased, it received a more modern petrol engine, now of 1127 cc. Claimed maximum output, which at launch had been , increased to , though there was a marginal reduction in maximum torque.

Following the demise of the 204 the new 1127 cc engine found its way into a version of the Peugeot 304 estate: the smaller engine enjoyed substantial tax benefits in the home market when compared to the 1290 cc engines fitted to most 304s.

For certain export markets engine compression ratios and power on the petrol engines were reduced in order to accommodate lower octane fuels.

Towards the end of 1968 a 1255 cc diesel engine option became available for the 204 estate and fourgonette (van) versions. At the time, this is thought to have been the smallest diesel engine fitted in a commercially available car anywhere in the world. In April 1973 the diesel unit was increased in size to 1357 cc, and in September 1975 this diesel unit finally became an option on the 204 saloon. Fuel economy on the 204 Diesel was startlingly good for the era, with overall fuel consumption of . Performance was correspondingly underwhelming with a claimed top speed of . Out of the approximately 150,000 diesel 204s produced, fewer than 30,000 were saloons. Until the early 1980s when Volkswagen started heavy promotion of their diesel-engined Golf/Rabbit, cars too small to be used as taxis were generally not offered with diesel engines to European customers.

==Layout and running gear==
204 engines were aluminium and transversely mounted which increased available passenger space within a given wheelbase: the 204 was the first production Peugeot to feature this format which later would become normal for small and mid-sized front-wheel-drive European passenger cars.

The engine had a distinctive design; the gearbox and differential were located directly below the engine block. This design helped Peugeot produce its first front-wheel-drive car.

The 204 was also the first Peugeot to be equipped with disc brakes, albeit only on the front wheels.

The car proved to have good handling, decent performance, and excellent fuel economy.

==The body==

The compact engine and the transverse engine combined with a body wider than the class average to provide a level of interior space comparable to larger cars such as Peugeot&#x27;s own 404: both cars were Pininfarina designs. The 204 featured neither the fins of the 404 nor the sharp corners characteristic of the other major French launch of 1965, the Renault 16. The resulting less aggressive look has been seen as a &#x27;more European&#x27; moving away from a tendency to follow US styling trends that had been apparent in new car launches during the preceding two decades. The Peugeot 204&#x27;s frontal styling owes much to the 1961 Cadillac Jacqueline by Pininfarina, whilst its rear and that of the prototype Pininfarina styled Mini-based MG ADO 34 of 1964 are strikingly similar. The rear end of the 1970-1974 Lancia Flavia Pininfarina Coupé displays the same influence.

The options list was not extensive but, as with the larger Peugeot saloons, it was possible to specify a sliding steel panel sunroof.

At launch only the four-door saloon version was offered, but the five-door &#x27;break&#x27; station wagon (estate) came along less than six months later in the Autumn of 1965. 1966 saw the arrival of a two-door cabriolet and a three-door hatchback, marketed as a coupé. Both employed a shortened chassis and were priced only 20% above the level of the (admittedly not particularly aggressively priced) saloon. 
The range was completed in 1966 with the arrival of the &#x27;fourgonnette&#x27; van version which in most respects followed the design of the estate, but with only one door on each side and a steel panel in place of the side windows behind the b pillar.

1969 saw the Autumn launch of the Peugeot 304 which was essentially a 204 with a slightly larger engine, a restyled front end and, in the case of the saloon version, a substantially increased rear overhang allowing greater luggage space. The 204 range was correspondingly pruned: the 204 coupé and cabriolet received the dashboard of the new 304 in 1969 only to be withdrawn in 1970, replaced by similarly bodied 304 equivalents. The estate and fourgonnette continued to be offered, along with the saloon, until the 204 range was withdrawn in 1976.

Although the model run lasted more than a decade, the Peugeot 204 changed very little during that time: very early saloons/berlines had a split rear bumper with numberplate set between the two-halves, a flat rear panel and small oval tail lights. For 1975, the stainless steel front grill was replaced by a black plastic grill of the same overall shape. The gearshaft for RHD UK cars was moved from the steering column to the floor.

This car&#x27;s body was one of the first to be shaped using spline curves, and was the first full application of Bézier curves as implemented by Bézier&#x27;s UNISURF software.

==Anglophone press reaction==
In Great Britain, a Peugeot 204 saloon tested by Britain&#x27;s Autocar magazine in September 1966 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 22 seconds. An overall fuel consumption of was achieved. The test car was priced by Peugeot in Britain at £903 including taxes: a British competitor, the Triumph 1300 was retailing for £835. The British domestic auto market still enjoyed significant tariff protection at this time. The journal commended the car for lively performance, positive accurate steering, fade free brakes, good fuel economy and light controls. Finish and equipment were described as &#x27;austere and disappointing in relation to price&#x27;, however.

Britain&#x27;s MOTOR Magazine tested one of the rare 3-door 204 Coupé models on 12 October 1968. In this case they found that the car would reach on the MIRA banked circuit, with being possible on flatter roads. was run in 17.3 seconds. Overall fuel consumption was . The price including all taxes was £1299. The car impressed the testers, despite its price, swollen by import taxes.

==Commercial==
When Peugeot 204 was launched in 1965, its competitors in French market were Renault 10 and the Simca 1300. Both were rear-wheel-drive while Renault was rear-engined. Citroën did not have any model in similar size to Peugeot 204, slotting in between its smaller Ami and larger DS until the introduction of GS in 1970. The Panhard 24, from Citroën&#x27;s niche sub-brand, was built in a very small volume, too small to be a serious competitor for Peugeot 204.

The 204 represented a startling change for Peugeot when it was launched, joining the newly emerging trend of adopting the transverse-mounted engine and front-wheel-drive system for the mid-sized saloons rather than continue with rear-wheel-drive system. The BMC ADO16 (introduced in 1963) and Fiat-developed Autobianchi Primula (1964) had largely played the role in that direction. 204 was the same length as Renault 10 but 20 cm shorter than Simca 1300. The space utilisation and package advantage found in 204 forced Renault and Simca to switch to front-wheel-drive when updating their mid-sized cars (Renault 12 in 1970 and Simca 1100 in 1967).

The numerous press leaks following up to the official introduction led to the enthusiastic orders sight unseen of 5,000. The sales success of 204 pushed Peugeot from its fourth place to the second place in the French sales charts, overtaking Citroën and Simca in the process. Along with introduction of Peugeot 304 in 1969, Peugeot has redefined the domestic market for small and medium-sized saloons. 72 percent of the 204s built were delivered in France with West Germany being the next largest export market. In Africa, 204 didn&#x27;t achieve the popularity of the larger, sturdier 404 and its successor, the 504. The sales success of 204 and 304 helped Peugeot with profitability and gave Peugeot the means to absorb Citroën and Simca into its conglomerate when those companies suffered from the financial collapse of the 1970s.

When the 204 production ended in 1976, it had no direct replacement and was filled in by 304, along with its successor, 305 (introduced in 1977). In 1982 the 205 was launched as &quot;204 successor&quot; in market position and size, though the 205 was a smaller, hatchback car more akin to the earlier 104.

===Competition===
Operating somewhat in the shadow of the victorious 404 and 504, the 204 did not have an extensive competition history. It was campaigned with a measure of success, however, such as at the 1966 East African Safari Rally. Out of six cars entered, the 204s all finished and took the first six positions in the 1,101–1,300 cc class. The 204 also took part in the 1971 Tour de France, where it finished in 49th place in the 3GT class.

In June 1973, the Peugeot 204 Proto Diesel set eight endurance speed records in Category A3, Group 3. The record beating runs took place at the autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry, using drivers including Jean Todt and Hannu Mikkola.

<text>The Champlain Valley is a region of the United States around Lake Champlain in Vermont and New York extending north slightly into Quebec, Canada. It is part of the St. Lawrence River drainage basin, drained northward by the Richelieu River into the St. Lawrence at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec (northeast of Montreal). The Richelieu valley is not generally referred to as part of the Champlain Valley.

The Champlain Lake Valley is the most heavily populated region in Vermont, broadly stretching eastward from the lake&#x27;s shore to the base of the Green Mountains. The state&#x27;s largest city, Burlington, is located on the lake, and the city&#x27;s associated suburban communities encompass part of the central section of the valley. Beyond urbanized Chittenden County, however, the valley&#x27;s landscape is primarily open pasture and row crops, making the Champlain Valley the most productive agricultural region of Vermont.

The New York portion of the Champlain Valley includes the eastern portions of Clinton County and Essex County. Most of this area is part of the Adirondack Park, offering tremendous views of the Adirondack High Peaks region and many recreational opportunities in the park and along the relatively undeveloped coast line of Lake Champlain. The city of Plattsburgh is to the north, and the historic town of Ticonderoga is in the southern part of the region. The northern part of Lake George is located at, and near Ticonderoga, and therefore is a part of the Champlain Valley.

==Geology and physiography==
The Champlain Valley is among the northernmost valleys considered part of the Great Appalachian Valley reaching from Canada to Alabama.

The Champlain Valley is a physiographic section of the larger Saint Lawrence Valley province, which in turn is part of the larger Appalachian physiographic division. In Vermont, the Champlain Valley is equivalent to the Vermont Lowlands physiographic region, and extends southward into the Valley of Vermont. The Vermont Lowlands are primarily underlain by sedimentary rocks, especially limestone and shale, though metamorphic rocks such as marble and slate are also present.

Lake Champlain is situated in the Champlain Valley between the Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New York, drained northward by the Richelieu River into the St. Lawrence River at Sorel-Tracy, Quebec (northeast of Montreal). Major tributaries of Lake Champlain include Otter Creek and the Winooski, Missisquoi, and Lamoille rivers in Vermont, and the Ausable, Chazy, Boquet, and Saranac rivers in New York. Lake Champlain also receives water from Lake George via the La Chute River

<text>The Dragonbone Chair is a fantasy novel by American writer Tad Williams, the first in his &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; trilogy. The saga follows a young man named Simon as he is caught up in an epic adventure.

==Plot introduction==
The story takes place on the fictional fantasy world of Osten Ard. The history of the world and the races present in Osten Ard have a great impact on the current events in the books.
Thousands of years ago the long-lived Gardenborn arrived in the land, fleeing a cataclysm. They were three tribes, the Zida&#x27;ya (commonly called Sithi), the Hikeda&#x27;ya (also called Norns) and the Tinukeda&#x27;ya (known as Dwarrows and Niskies). In Osten Ard the Gardenborn prospered and they built nine great cities of tremendous beauty. The first two tribes had ruled the third in their ancestral home called the Garden, but in Osten Ard the Tinukeda&#x27;ya went their own way, developing into two separate tribes, the seafaring Niskies and the earth-dwelling Dwarrows. The other two tribes also split ways, making a pact at Sesuad&#x27;ra, the Stone of Farewell. Their main subject of argument was the appearance of Men or mortals in Osten Ard. The Zida&#x27;ya were content to leave Men alone to go their own way, as long as they didn&#x27;t trespass in Sithi lands. The Hikeda&#x27;ya were of the opinion that the mortals had to be wiped out or driven from Osten Ard. The Norns and their fell queen Utuk&#x27;u, eldest and most powerful of the Gardenborn, removed to the north of the world, taking the two northernmost cities for their own. Three cities were also given to the Tinukeda&#x27;ya; one was sea-bound Jhina&#x27;t&#x27;senei which went to the Niskies and the other two were deep under the earth which went to the Dwarrows, the smaller tribe of the Tinukeda&#x27;ya. In the greatest of them all, Asu&#x27;a, the High King ruled.

But Men began to prosper and advance and the sea empire of Nabban rose and fell without it disturbing the Gardenborn. The Sithi also had great friendship with the Hernystiri of the west. Then the Rimmersmen came with iron and to them the Gardenborn were devils and demons, to be killed on sight. Unfortunately the Gardenborn suffer from a severe allergy to iron and even with their magics and their own iron-hard witchwood weapons, they were beaten back, one after the other. The Hernystiri were the only ones who stood by the Sithi in the final battle where both armies were destroyed. The remaining Sithi withdrew to Asu&#x27;a and there awaited the end. Ineluki, the King&#x27;s younger son, wove terrible magic at the end with five of his servants and there they and Asu&#x27;a were destroyed. However, the spell gave the remaining Sithi time to flee to Aldheorte forest, where they continued to live in secrecy.

During the five hundred years that followed the fall of Asu&#x27;a, six different kings ruled in the castle built on the Sithi ruins, called Hayholt. The latest of these is king John Presbyter, who is dying as the story opens.

Simon is an ordinary scullery boy who is taken under the tutelage of Morgenes. When King John Presbyter dies and his son Elias ascends the throne, the way opens for a long-dormant evil to enter the realm. Elias, driven by his evil advisor, moves to eliminate his brother Josua. Caught in the struggle, Simon is forced to flee as best he can, and the young man soon finds himself taking part in adventures he had only dreamed of.

==Plot summary==
Simon, a fourteen-year-old kitchen boy and servant in the great castle Hayholt, muddles his way through the daily routines of castle drudgery in the last days of the long reign of King John Presbyter. Simon is thrilled when luck turns his way and he finds himself apprenticed to the good Doctor Morgenes, the castle&#x27;s healer and wizard, after which Simon alternates his time between his menial chores and learning to read and write, under instruction by the doctor. Shortly after the death of the great King John, his son Elias, whom many say is a pawn of the evil cleric Pryrates, takes the throne. Shortly afterwards, King Elias&#x27;s brother Josua mysteriously disappears, and the new reign begins to curdle in suspicion and discontent. Elias, blinded by his desire for power, creates a pact with the undead Sithi ruler, the Storm King, who himself seeks to regain his lost realm through a pact with one of human royal blood.

When Simon accidentally stumbles into the castle dungeons, he discovers that Prince Josua is being held captive, so he and Morgenes conspire to rescue the prince. Simon and Morgenes are successful, and Josua is able to flee the castle. Soon after, Elias&#x27;s soldiers, led by Pryrates, storm Morgenes&#x27;s office. Morgenes is slain by a dark magic, and Simon is able to flee the castle through a secret passage at the back of the doctor&#x27;s office. Armed only with his mentor&#x27;s biography of the good King John, Simon is lost and despondent.

After endless hours in the tunnels beneath Hayholt, which is actually the remains of the Sithi castle, Asu&#x27;a, Simon stumbles back into the open beyond the castle and town. There, he accidentally witnesses a scene of evil magic involving the king, Pryrates and a few white-faced and white-haired demons. Horrified, he stumbles through the woods on the road north towards Naglimund, the seat of Prince Josua. About halfway to Naglimund, he stumbles upon a strange creature, caught in a cotsman&#x27;s trap. Simon realizes it must be one of the Sithi, an elven-like folk who was thought to have disappeared from the lands. He rescues him from the trap and in answer is shot at with a white arrow. At that moment, he encounters a troll by the name of Binabik. Binabik tells Simon that the white arrow is a symbol of an obligation towards Simon, and together they travel further towards Naglimund.

While traveling through the Aldheorte forest, they save a young servant girl and her sister from vicious hounds. They travel to Geloë, a witch who helps them escape the soldiers pursuing them. While in her house, Simon, Binabik and Geloë also walk the Dreamroad to try to find answers but only find enemies waiting. They finally reach Naglimund, where they meet with Prince Josua. Simon begins training to be a soldier, as it is common knowledge that Elias is leading an army towards Naglimund. Whilst having a raed [council], an old man appears: Jarnauga. There, the travelers learn of the existence of three legendary swords by the names of Minneyar (or &quot;Year of Memory&quot;), Sorrow, and Thorn. The magic of these swords is the only hope against the combined power of the two High Kings, the ancient Sithi and the new-crowned human, who already have possession of at least one of the swords. They also learn the history of the Sithi and the Storm King, and of the existence of Utuk&#x27;u, Queen of the Norns, who are the northern cousins of the Sithi. It is then that Simon realizes that his vision of the dark magic just after his escape from Hayhold was no vision at all but an actual event, and that the white-faced demons were actually Norns. In Naglimund, Simon also learns of a small group of scholars known as the League of the Scroll, of which Morgenes was a member and of which Jarnauga and Binabik are also members. Binabik is only a recent member, after the death of his master Ookequk. Recognizing the true danger facing the land of Osten Ard, only the League holds the knowledge of times past, which may be the only hope of salvation for young Simon and his friends. To Simon&#x27;s dismay he also finds out that Marya the serving girl whom they saved is actually Miriamele, only child and daughter of King Elias, who had fled her father&#x27;s madness to join her uncle&#x27;s cause.

They learn then that the black sword Thorn, once belonging to Camaris the greatest knight of history, is not lost in the depths of the sea, as once thought. It may still exist in the frozen heights to the north, near Binabik&#x27;s ancestral home.

Simon and Binabik join a group of soldiers to go to the far north to recover the magical blade. Along the way they run into Sithi and the one that Simon saved turns out to be the son of the ruling House named Jiriki. Together with An&#x27;nai, one of his kinsmen, the Sitha prince joins their quest to the north and helps them survive several dangers. Eventually, Simon and his small company reach the icy mountains which are home to the powerful sword. Simon discovers the blade but shortly afterwards the troupe is attacked by a fierce iceworm, Igjarjuk. Simon, despite his fears, bravely tries to fight it off, suffering a wound in the process.

As the novel progresses, the narrative widens, giving the reader secondary viewpoints besides those of Simon. Some of the side stories, which have great importance nonetheless, include those of Isgrimnur, Duke of Rimmersgard; Maegwin, the daughter of the Hernystiri client king; and Tiamak, a scribe in the marshes of the distant South.

Miriamele, the king&#x27;s daughter, fled to her uncle in Naglimund. His protectiveness of her frustrates her however, so she flees Naglimund before its fall towards her kin in Nabban, intending to win their allegiance. A drunken monk named Cadrach travels with her; he has many secrets and a mysterious past. Isgrimmnur is sent after Miriamele to ensure her safety and return her to Josua.

In Hernystir, the king and his son are slain and their people driven into hiding in the mountains. There, Count Eolair attempts to assist Maegwin the king&#x27;s daughter but she is sinking into madness while trying to find a way to save her people.

The book ends with the fall of Naglimund: after King Elias accepted the Storm King&#x27;s terms and bargain, a host of Norns, giants, and undead servants of the Storm King arrive and utterly destroy the castle. Josua escapes with only 11 other people, amongst them Deornoth, his sworn sword, and Gutrun and Isorn, wife and son of Isgrimmnur. Simon opens his eyes after the dragon to find his face bearing a long burn scar and a swath of hair turned white.

<doc id="967278" wikidata="Q262627" url="?curid=967278" title="Kika (TV channel)">
<text>Kika (currently stylised as KiKA, formerly as KI.KA; formally , ) is a German free-to-air television channel based in Erfurt, Germany. It is managed by a joint venture by public-service broadcasters ARD and ZDF. Its intended audience is children and the youth, devoid of advertising, and it is generally watched by children 3 to 13. The MDR is responsible for its playout.

The channel also repeats shows, such as &quot;Tabaluga tivi&quot; from ZDF&#x27;s main service.

==Mascot==
Kika&#x27;s mascot is the puppet character Bernd das Brot, a chronically depressed loaf of bread.

==Announcers==
The channel uses live continuity announcers. Four of the most popular announcers were Juri Tetzlaff (1997–2010), Karsten Blumenthal (1997–2004), Singa Gätgens (1997–2010), and Lukas Koch (2003-2009).

==History==
In the channel’s early years, the program consisted mostly of series and shows that were already being broadcast on ARD and ZDF. Whole programs were being broadcast simultaneously on the mother channels and the children’s channel, for example the afternoon program of ZDF. Kika showed German as well as international series, like cartoon classics from the 1970s and 80s (&quot;Heidi&quot;, &quot;Biene Maja&quot;, &quot;Wickie&quot;, &quot;Little Amadeus&quot; or &quot;Nils Holgersson&quot;). Classics of children’s TV like film versions of Astrid Lindgren books or the Augsburger Puppenkiste were also regularly being broadcast.

After a time, more original broadcasts started appearing in Kika’s program, like &quot;Schloss Einstein&quot;, and &quot;The Tribe&quot;.

The all-girl popular music band Saphir was formed of the 2007-2010 winners of the talent show &quot;KI.KA LIVE — Beste Stimme gesucht!&quot; (Best Voice Wanted).

There have been some changes in the programming in recent years. Although it had been one of the channel&#x27;s original aims to broadcast both animated and live-action series, the former now predominate (85%). Apart from the numerous animated series, the afternoon soap opera &quot;Schloss Einstein&quot; is currently almost the sole live-action series in Kika&#x27;s lineup during the day. There are only two other live-action shows, one of which is aired in the afternoon and the other in the evening.

The channel sometimes offers continuous rebroadcasts of series that have come to an end. Similar to the procedure of private commercial stations, these series are broadcast as double features. But most of the older series, which had been repeatedly broadcast from 1997 to 2004, are currently excluded from the lineup. The fact that ARD and ZDF no longer own the appropriate broadcasting rights partly accounts for this.

The difference between the weekday and the weekend programming keeps vanishing steadily, since many series are aired daily. Thus some series, such as &quot;Pet Alien&quot;, &quot;Being Ian&quot;, and &quot;Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks&quot;, are almost continually part of the programme.

&quot;Augsburger Puppenkiste&quot;, a rather old German television programme which had always been on the air on Saturday and Sunday mornings, ceased being broadcast on Kika for four years but returned to the channel&#x27;s lineup in April 2008. Many programmes, especially older series, such as &quot;Pan Tau&quot;, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;, and &quot;Es war einmal&quot;, can be seen only on the ZDF and regional channels.

Two children&#x27;s movies are aired on Kika, on Fridays and Sundays; these are more often animated films rather than live-action films.

In July 2020, Kika announced that it would participate in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, with an entry for the 2020 edition written by singer-songwriter Levent Geiger, a finalist of &quot;&quot; in 2015 and 2019. The performer was decided in the national final &quot;Dein Song für Warschau&quot;, won by Susan Oseloff.

==Kikaninchen==
Kikaninchen is a segment on KiKA whose main character is a blue, friendly rabbit, that is very popular among children in Germany. Kikaninchen is known for its entertainment, engaging children in fun and educational games with its friends, as well as featuring preschool shows during the segment. Kikaninchen airs only on weekdays, between 6:10AM (after Logo!) and somewhere around 10:20AM (actual end time may vary). His friends are Anni, Jule and Christian. His famous catchphrase is &quot;Dibedibedab&quot;!

<text>Domestic policy, also known as internal policy, is a type of public policy overseeing administrative decisions that are directly related to all issues and activity within a state&#x27;s borders. It differs from foreign policy, which refers to the ways a government advances its interests in external politics. Domestic policy covers a wide range of areas, including business, education, energy, healthcare, law enforcement, money and taxes, natural resources, social welfare, and personal rights and freedoms.

==Implementation==

The form of government of any particular state largely determines how its domestic policy is formed and implemented. Under authoritarian governments, a ruling group may pursue its domestic policy goals without the input or consent of the people being governed. But in parliamentary democratic societies, the will of citizens has a much greater influence.

In a democracy, the formal design of domestic policy is chiefly the responsibility of elected leaders, lawmaking bodies, and specialized government agencies. But a number of other factors also play a role in the process. Voters, for instance, determine which individuals and political parties have the power to determine policy. The mass media distribute, and opine, information about domestic issues and influence the beliefs and opinions of the people. Lobbyists, activist groups, and other organizations also work to influence policy through a variety of methods. Such methods may include monetary donations, promises of support, advertising campaigns, or demonstrations and protests.

The effectiveness of domestic policy depends on the government bureaucracy (system of agencies) that puts laws and programs into action. In some cases, bureaucracies act slowly or inefficiently, or fail to apply policies as they were originally intended. Domestic policy may also face challenges in the courts. In many countries, courts have the power of judicial review, which allows its judges to strike down any legislative or executive action that they find in violation of the policy&#x27;s constitution.

== Areas ==

=== Cultural policy ===

Cultural policy pertains to the arts and creative endeavors of a government or its citizens. A state&#x27;s cultural policy is used to &quot;channel both aesthetic creativity and collective ways of life&quot; through a bureaucratic process. Cultural policy defines many of the fundamental aspects of a nation&#x27;s existence, such as the national language. These policies may be influential in forming a national identity, fostering civic responsibilities, and defining ethical behavior. Many countries have a ministry of culture that oversees the government&#x27;s cultural policy. Arts policy, language policy, sports policy, and museum planning are all policy areas governed by cultural policy.

=== Economic policy ===
Economic policy pertains to a country&#x27;s economy and treasury. Monetary policy governs the supply of money and interest rates in a state, while fiscal policy governs how the state raises funds and decides how they are spent. Developed nations typically have a central bank that regulates monetary policy semi-independently of political actors. Tax policy, regulation, monetary systems, corporate law, public works, competition law, incomes policy, food policy, energy policy, and natural resource management are all policy areas governed by economic policy.

=== Social policy ===
Social policy pertains to the well-being of society and the response to societal challenges. Civil and political rights, education policy, drug policy, health policy, housing policy, and public security are all policy areas governed by social policy.

<doc id="967282" wikidata="Q1167968" url="?curid=967282" title="Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn">
<text>Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn is a trilogy of epic fantasy novels by American writer Tad Williams, comprising &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; (1988), &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot; (1990), and &quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot; (1993).

&quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; takes place on the fictional continent of Osten Ard, comprising several united countries. Williams used several characters, both protagonist and antagonist, as point of view characters throughout the novels, presenting the reader with an assortment of disparate and subjective viewpoints.

A novelette set in the world of Osten Ard, &quot;The Burning Man&quot;, was released in 1998 and later published as a graphic novel. A sequel trilogy, &quot;The Last King of Osten Ard&quot;, began publication in 2017, following 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Heart of What Was Lost&quot;. A prequel to the entirety of Osten Ard, &quot;Brothers of the Wind&quot; was published in 2021.

==Plot synopsis==
&quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; takes place on the fictional continent of Osten Ard, home to several united races, including humans, elf-like immortals known as Sithi, and dwarf-like mountain-dwellers named Qanuc. Most of these races have been living in relative unity for decades, thanks to King John the Presbyter (also known as Prester John), who is known to have slain a dragon. When the first novel opens Prester John&#x27;s health in his advanced age is failing and his sons, Elias and Josua, quarrel over who will ascend to the throne. Meanwhile, a dark secret held by Prester John, and the ambitions of a priest named Pryrates, threaten the stability of the continent. Williams used several characters, both villain and protagonist, as point of view characters throughout the scope of the novels.

The series primarily follows Simon, a lowly kitchen scullion in Hayholt Castle, as he undergoes tutelage from Doctor Morgenes and is cared for by Rachel &quot;the Dragon&quot;, the matriarch of the castle&#x27;s kitchen and chambermaids. When King John dies, Elias takes the throne with the mysterious priest Pryrates as his advisor; Josua mysteriously disappears and the seasons begin changing, bringing bitter winters and drought-laden summers. Simon, ever the mischievous adventurer, accidentally uncovers some of Pryrates&#x27; true nature and becomes wrapped into a conspiracy that threatens not only his country of Erkynland, but Osten Ard itself.

==Publication history==
&quot;To Green Angel Tower&quot;&#x27;s paperback edition is presented in two parts due to its sheer size, totaling nearly 1600 pages in length. Parts 1 and 2 were subtitled &quot;Siege&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;, respectively, in their United Kingdom pressings.

==Reception==

A nationwide bestseller in the United States, &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; was well received by book critics. Of &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot;, &quot;Locus&quot; called it &quot;an epic fantasy you can get lost in for days, not just hours&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot; is a &quot;panoramic, vigorous, often moving sequel to &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot;&quot;. Of the series, Amaranth Magazine said, &quot;This is quite simply the best story I have read next to LORD OF THE RINGS…destined to become among the greatest Fantasy epics of all time.&quot;

The series was recommended by Ross Douthat during the &quot;New York Times&quot; podcast &quot;The Argument&quot; on April 4, 2019.

==Legacy==
American author George R. R. Martin was a fan of &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot;. Martin has cited Williams&#x27; work as a key influence of his own epic high fantasy novel series, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. American author Christopher Paolini, writer of &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot;, also cited &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; as an influence, calling it &quot;one of the great fantasy epics of all time.&quot;

<text>The Stern College for Women (SCW) is the undergraduate women&#x27;s college of arts and sciences of Yeshiva University. It is located at the university&#x27;s Israel Henry Beren Campus in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan.

The college provides programs in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and Jewish studies, along with combined degree programs in dentistry, physical therapy, and engineering, among others. It grants the bachelor of arts degree, and also awards the Associate of Arts degree in Hebrew language, literature, and culture. SCW&#x27;s dual undergraduate curriculum includes the Basic Jewish Studies Program, a one- to two-year introduction to Bible, Jewish law, and Hebrew that allows students without traditional yeshiva or day school backgrounds to be integrated into SCW&#x27;s regular Jewish studies courses. The Rebecca Ivry Department of Jewish Studies offers courses ranging from elementary to advanced levels in Bible, Hebrew, Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish laws and customs. The S. Daniel Abraham Honors Program stresses writing, critical analysis, cultural enrichment, individual mentoring, and the development of leadership skills.

SCW was established in 1954, based on a gift from the late industrialist Max Stern. Today it serves more than 2,000 students from approximately two dozen U.S. states and a similar number of nations, including students registered at Syms School of Business.

==History==

SCW opened in September 1954 with an incoming class of 32 students. The school was named in honor of Emanuel and Caroline Stern, the parents of Max Stern, who was a major contributor to the building of the college. SCW was founded as a response to YU’s post-WWII goals within the Orthodox Jewish community, one of which was to expand the impact of Orthodox Judaism on the greater American Jewish community Between 1945-1954, YU also opened a medical school, and graduate schools for Jewish social work, education, and psychology, as well as a community service department. Enrollment in SCW quickly grew to 500 students as the school offered diverse programs, which met the educational needs of students from different religious backgrounds. In the early years, the majority of students’ career goal was to be a school teacher, thus making it easy to develop a curriculum.

Karen Bacon, a 1964 graduate of SCW who had earned a PhD in microbiology from UCLA and worked as an assistant professor of biology at UCLA, was appointed the dean of SCW in 1977. She was the first woman to hold the position. In 1977, shortly after Rabbi Norman Lamm was appointed the president of YU, the administration worked to develop a more intensive, text-based Jewish studies program for SCW, including creating a Beit Midrash (Jewish study hall). On October 11, 1977, Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik delivered the introductory shiur (lecture) to inaugurate the program. In 1980, SCW restructured its Jewish studies department in an effort to offer students the opportunity to study classical Jewish texts. In 1987, the Sy Syms School of Business (since renamed Syms School of Business) was established. 

In 2001, the Graduate Program in Advanced Talmudic Studies (GPATS) was established. The program offers high-level Torah study, and graduates move on to serve as scholars in communities and schools in the United States and Israel. As of 2019, there are 977 students enrolled in SCW and 187 in the Syms School of Business.

==Building==
The school&#x27;s building at 253 Lexington Avenue at the corner of East 35th Street in the Murray Hill was built in 1911 for the Packard Commercial School – which later became Packard Business College and Packard Junior College – at the cost of $250,000. In 1954 it was taken over by Yeshiva University for the inaugural class of the Stern College for Women.

<doc id="967315" wikidata="Q33447" url="?curid=967315" title="Temporal paradox">
<text>A temporal paradox, time paradox, or time travel paradox, is a paradox, an apparent contradiction, or logical contradiction associated with the idea of time travel or other foreknowledge of the future. While the notion of time travel to the future complies with the current understanding of physics via relativistic time dilation, temporal paradoxes arise from circumstances involving hypothetical time travel to the past – and are often used to demonstrate its impossibility.

==Types==
Temporal paradoxes fall into three broad groups: bootstrap paradoxes, consistency paradoxes, and Newcomb&#x27;s paradox. Bootstrap paradoxes violate causality by allowing future events to influence the past and cause themselves, or &quot;bootstrapping&quot;, which derives from the idiom &quot;.&quot; Consistency paradoxes, on the other hand, are those where future events influence the past to cause an apparent contradiction, exemplified by the grandfather paradox, where a person travels to the past to prevent the conception of one of their ancestors, thus eliminating all the ancestor&#x27;s descendants. Newcomb&#x27;s paradox stems from the apparent contradictions that stem from the assumptions of both free will and foreknowledge of future events. All of these are sometimes referred to individually as &quot;causal loops.&quot; The term &quot;time loop&quot; is sometimes referred to as a causal loop, but although they appear similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting.

===Bootstrap paradox===
A bootstrap paradox, also known as an information loop, an &quot;information paradox&quot;, an &quot;ontological paradox&quot;, or a &quot;predestination paradox&quot; is a paradox of time travel that occurs when any event, such as an action, information, an object, or a person, ultimately causes itself, as a consequence of either retrocausality or time travel.

Backward time travel would allow information, people, or objects whose histories seem to &quot;come from nowhere&quot;. Such causally looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. The notion of objects or information that are &quot;self-existing&quot; in this way is often viewed as paradoxical. A notable example occurs in the 1958 science fiction short story &quot;—All You Zombies—&quot;, by Robert A. Heinlein, wherein the main character, an intersex individual, becomes both their own mother and father; it was adapted with great fidelity in the 2014 film &quot;Predestination&quot;. Allen Everett gives the movie &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; as an example involving an object with no origin: an old woman gives a watch to a playwright who later travels back in time and meets the same woman when she was young, and shows her the watch that she will later give to him. An example of information which &quot;came from nowhere&quot; is in the movie &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;, in which a 23rd-century engineer travels back in time, and gives the formula for transparent aluminum to the 20th-century engineer who supposedly invented it.

===Predestination paradox===
Smeenk uses the term &quot;predestination paradox&quot; to refer specifically to situations in which a time traveler goes back in time to try to prevent some event in the past.

The &quot;predestination paradox&quot; is a concept in time travel and temporal mechanics, often explored in science fiction. It occurs when a future event is the cause of a past event, which in turn becomes the cause of the future event, forming a self-sustaining loop in time. This paradox challenges conventional understandings of cause and effect, as the events involved are both the origin and the result of each other. A notable example is found in the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, where a character saves her father in the past, fulfilling a memory he had shared with her as a child about a strange woman having saved his life. The predestination paradox raises philosophical questions about free will, determinism, and the nature of time itself. It is commonly used as a narrative device in fiction to highlight the interconnectedness of events and the inevitability of certain outcomes.

===Consistency paradox===
The consistency paradox or grandfather paradox occurs when the past is changed in any way that directly negates the conditions required for the time travel to occur in the first place, thus creating a contradiction. A common example given is traveling to the past and preventing the conception of one&#x27;s ancestors (such as causing the death of the ancestor&#x27;s parent beforehand), thus preventing the conception of oneself. If the traveler were not born, then it would not be possible to undertake such an act in the first place; therefore, the ancestor proceeds to beget the traveler&#x27;s next-generation ancestor and secure the line to the traveler. There is no predicted outcome to this scenario. Consistency paradoxes occur whenever changing the past is possible. A possible resolution is that a time traveller &quot;can&quot; do anything that &quot;did&quot; happen, but &quot;cannot&quot; do anything that &quot;did not&quot; happen. Doing something that did not happen results in a contradiction. This is referred to as the Novikov self-consistency principle.

==== Variants ====

The grandfather paradox encompasses any change to the past, and it is presented in many variations, including killing one&#x27;s past self. Both the &quot;retro-suicide paradox&quot; and the &quot;grandfather paradox&quot; appeared in letters written into &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in the 1920s. Another variant of the grandfather paradox is the &quot;Hitler paradox&quot; or &quot;Hitler&#x27;s murder paradox&quot;, in which the protagonist travels back in time to murder Adolf Hitler before he can rise to power in Germany, thus preventing World War II and the Holocaust. Rather than necessarily physically preventing time travel, the action removes any &quot;reason&quot; for the travel, along with any knowledge that the reason ever existed.

Physicist John Garrison et al. give a variation of the paradox of an electronic circuit that sends a signal through a time machine to shut itself off, and receives the signal before it sends it.

===Newcomb&#x27;s paradox===

Newcomb&#x27;s paradox is a thought experiment showing an apparent contradiction between the expected utility principle and the strategic dominance principle. The thought experiment is often extended to explore causality and free will by allowing for &quot;perfect predictors&quot;: if perfect predictors of the future exist, for example if time travel exists as a mechanism for making perfect predictions, then perfect predictions appear to contradict free will because decisions apparently made with free will are already known to the perfect predictor. Predestination does not necessarily involve a supernatural power, and could be the result of other &quot;infallible foreknowledge&quot; mechanisms. Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in Newcomb&#x27;s paradox.

== Proposed resolutions ==
=== Logical impossibility ===
Even without knowing whether time travel to the past is physically possible, it is possible to show using modal logic that changing the past results in a logical contradiction. If it is necessarily true that the past happened in a certain way, then it is false and impossible for the past to have occurred in any other way. A time traveler would not be able to change the past from the way it &quot;is,&quot; but would only act in a way that is already consistent with what &quot;necessarily&quot; happened.

Consideration of the grandfather paradox has led some to the idea that time travel is by its very nature paradoxical and therefore logically impossible. For example, the philosopher Bradley Dowden made this sort of argument in the textbook &quot;Logical Reasoning&quot;, arguing that the possibility of creating a contradiction rules out time travel to the past entirely. However, some philosophers and scientists believe that time travel into the past need not be logically impossible provided that there is no possibility of changing the past, as suggested, for example, by the Novikov self-consistency principle. Dowden revised his view after being convinced of this in an exchange with the philosopher Norman Swartz.

=== Illusory time ===
Consideration of the possibility of backward time travel in a hypothetical universe described by a Gödel metric led famed logician Kurt Gödel to assert that time might itself be a sort of illusion. He suggests something along the lines of the block time view, in which time is just another dimension like space, with all events at all times being fixed within this four-dimensional &quot;block&quot;.

=== Physical impossibility ===
Sergey Krasnikov writes that these bootstrap paradoxes – information or an object looping through time – are the same; the primary apparent paradox is a physical system evolving into a state in a way that is not governed by its laws. He does not find these paradoxical and attributes problems regarding the validity of time travel to other factors in the interpretation of general relativity.

==== Self-sufficient loops ====
A 1992 paper by physicists Andrei Lossev and Igor Novikov labeled such items without origin as &quot;Jinn&quot;, with the singular term &quot;Jinnee&quot;. This terminology was inspired by the Jinn of the Quran, which are described as leaving no trace when they disappear. Lossev and Novikov allowed the term &quot;Jinn&quot; to cover both objects and information with the reflexive origin; they called the former &quot;Jinn of the first kind&quot;, and the latter &quot;Jinn of the second kind&quot;. They point out that an object making circular passage through time must be identical whenever it is brought back to the past, otherwise it would create an inconsistency; the second law of thermodynamics seems to require that the object tends to a lower energy state throughout its history, and such objects that are identical in repeating points in their history seem to contradict this, but Lossev and Novikov argued that since the second law only requires entropy to increase in &quot;closed&quot; systems, a Jinnee could interact with its environment in such a way as to regain &quot;lost&quot; entropy. They emphasize that there is no &quot;strict difference&quot; between Jinn of the first and second kind. Krasnikov equivocates between &quot;Jinn&quot;, &quot;self-sufficient loops&quot;, and &quot;self-existing objects&quot;, calling them &quot;lions&quot; or &quot;looping or intruding objects&quot;, and asserts that they are no less physical than conventional objects, &quot;which, after all, also could appear only from either infinity or a singularity.&quot;

==== Novikov self-consistency principle ====

The self-consistency principle developed by Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov expresses one view as to how backward time travel would be possible without the generation of paradoxes. According to this hypothesis, even though general relativity permits some exact solutions that allow for time travel that contain closed timelike curves that lead back to the same point in spacetime, physics in or near closed timelike curves (time machines) can only be consistent with the universal laws of physics, and thus only self-consistent events can occur. Anything a time traveler does in the past must have been part of history all along, and the time traveler can never do anything to prevent the trip back in time from happening, since this would represent an inconsistency. The authors concluded that time travel need not lead to unresolvable paradoxes, regardless of what type of object was sent to the past.
Physicist Joseph Polchinski considered a potentially paradoxical situation involving a billiard ball that is fired into a wormhole at just the right angle such that it will be sent back in time and collides with its earlier self, knocking it off course, which would stop it from entering the wormhole in the first place. Kip Thorne referred to this problem as &quot;Polchinski&#x27;s paradox&quot;. Thorne and two of his students at Caltech, Fernando Echeverria and Gunnar Klinkhammer, went on to find a solution that avoided any inconsistencies, and found that there was more than one self-consistent solution, with slightly different angles for the glancing blow in each case. Later analysis by Thorne and Robert Forward showed that for certain initial trajectories of the billiard ball, there could be an infinite number of self-consistent solutions. It is plausible that there exist self-consistent extensions for every possible initial trajectory, although this has not been proven. The lack of constraints on initial conditions only applies to spacetime outside of the chronology-violating region of spacetime; the constraints on the chronology-violating region might prove to be paradoxical, but this is not yet known.

Novikov&#x27;s views are not widely accepted. Visser views causal loops and Novikov&#x27;s self-consistency principle as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; solution, and supposes that there are far more damaging implications of time travel. Krasnikov similarly finds no inherent fault in causal loops but finds other problems with time travel in general relativity. Another conjecture, the cosmic censorship hypothesis, suggests that every closed timelike curve passes through an event horizon, which prevents such causal loops from being observed.

==== Parallel universes ====
The interacting-multiple-universes approach is a variation of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics that involves time travelers arriving in a different universe than the one from which they came; it has been argued that, since travelers arrive in a different universe&#x27;s history and not their history, this is not &quot;genuine&quot; time travel. Stephen Hawking has argued for the chronology protection conjecture, that even if the MWI is correct, we should expect each time traveler to experience a single self-consistent history so that time travelers remain within their world rather than traveling to a different one.

David Deutsch has proposed that quantum computation with a negative delay—backward time travel—produces only self-consistent solutions, and the chronology-violating region imposes constraints that are not apparent through classical reasoning. However Deutsch&#x27;s self-consistency condition has been demonstrated as capable of being fulfilled to arbitrary precision by any system subject to the laws of classical statistical mechanics, even if it is not built up by quantum systems. Allen Everett has also argued that even if Deutsch&#x27;s approach is correct, it would imply that any macroscopic object composed of multiple particles would be split apart when traveling back in time, with different particles emerging in different worlds.

<text>HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; was a 74-gun third rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Blackwall Yard, London on 27 April 1785. She was the first ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name.

==Career==

In April 1795, &quot;Victorious&quot; ran aground on the Shipwash Sand, in the North Sea off the coast of Suffolk and was dismasted.

During the month of February 1796, &quot;Victorious&quot; encountered and captured the French privateer brig &quot;Hasard&quot;, formerly the British pilot ship &quot;Cartier&quot;, which was returning to Île de France (Mauritius) with a 10-man crew after having captured the East Indiaman &quot;Triton&quot;.

She took part in the action of 9 September 1796.

&quot;Victorious&quot; participated in the capture of the Dutch colony of Cape Town, in which an invasion had been caused due to fears of France&#x27;s expansion across the world. Britain seized the strategic Cape Town and thus secured the nation its routes to the East. The rest of her career was spent in the warm climates of the East Indies, patrolling the vast waters in that region.

In 1801 Captain Pulteney Malcolm took command as &quot;Victorious&quot; served as flagship for Admiral Peter Rainier.

==Fate==

On her homeward passage from the East Indies in 1803, &quot;Victorious&quot; proved exceedingly leaky. When she met with heavy weather in the North Atlantic, her crew had difficulty keeping her afloat till she reached the Tagus, where she was run ashore. Malcolm, with the officers and crew, returned to England in two vessels that he chartered at Lisbon. She was condemned and then broken up in August at Lisbon.

On 1 August &quot;Sir Andrew Mitchell&quot; arrived at Portsmouth, in company with , carrying Malcolm, his officers, and crew. &quot;Sir Andrew Mitchell&quot;, R. Gilmore, master, was a 14-year old, 522-ton (bm) ship on the Cork-Lisbon trade.

<doc id="967337" wikidata="Q5603090" url="?curid=967337" title="Green Pond, New Jersey">
<text>Green Pond is a private lakeside residential unincorporated community within Rockaway Township in Morris County, New Jersey, United States. The lakeside community is managed by two corporations, Green Pond Corporation and Lake End Corporation.

Green Pond is located in Rockaway Township in Morris County, but has a Newfoundland (Passaic County) mailing address. Newfoundland came to wider attention in 2003 when large portions of the independent film, &quot;The Station Agent&quot;, were filmed there. Several scenes of this film took place on Green Pond Road (County Route 513), a public thoroughfare which connects a former New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway depot and Route 23 to Lake End Road and to the private lanes of the Green Pond Village community. Lakeside scenes of &quot;The Station Agent&quot; that were set on Green Pond were actually filmed elsewhere, as the Lake End and Green Pond Corporations denied lake access to the filmmakers.

New homeowners in either Green Pond or Lake End Corporations pay a fee to the relevant corporation in addition to the usual real estate closing fees, and become &quot;stockholders&quot; in exchange for an interest in the common lands which surround the community. Only stockholders and their guests (who are required to wear ID) may access the lake and the community facilities, which include tennis courts, ballfields, a community center, and a membership-only yacht club that races Comet sailboats. On summer weekends and major holidays, a security guard is stationed at the entrance to Green Pond village to prevent unauthorized access to the beach areas.

==Lake==
Green Pond is a spring-fed glacial lake (elevation ) that runs along a roughly northeast-southwest axis, bordered on the longer, lateral sides by rocky terrain. On the eastern side is Copperas Mountain (elevation 1,222 feet), and on the west, Green Pond Mountain (elevation 1,240 feet) rises sharply from the lake with a boulder-strewn shoreline. The lake&#x27;s outflow at the southwestern end is into tributaries of the Rockaway River, which run through the United States Army&#x27;s Picatinny Arsenal and through an area of legally designated wetlands where development is restricted.

Despite a name suggestive of a small lily pad and algae-coated pool, Green Pond lake is fairly large (approximately long and in breadth at its widest point - total), and the water clarity is high due to the lake&#x27;s source (underground cold-water springs).

The lake has a number of sand bars and other shoaling features, and the average depth is . There are deeper areas also: the maximum depth was measured at during soundings taken in the 1970s by John Stenz and Doug Charlton. The lake is stocked seasonally with trout and bass; other aquatic species include sunfish, perch, catfish, bluegills, pickerel, and snapping turtles.

=== Community activities ===
Stockholders of the community or guests are granted access to the community facilities, including the tennis courts, ballfields, sailing and motor boating privileges, and participation in the Green Pond Yacht Club and active Community Club, which sponsors several year-round activities. Recreational activities provided by Green Pond include fishing, swimming, water skiing, water tubing, hiking, and cross-country ski trails.

==Geology and mining history==
The geology of the Green Pond region is peculiar. The lake is situated in the center of the precambrian New York-New Jersey Highlands, a northeast-southwest system of folded and faulted igneous and metamorphic rocks that form numerous ridges and valleys. The &quot;Green Pond Outlier&quot;, named for the lake, is a thin belt of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that bisects the precambrian crystalline rocks and extends for more than between Interstate 80 in New Jersey and the New York Thruway in New York. In some places, the ground cover is glacial till from the terminal moraine of the Wisconsin glaciation.

From the American Revolutionary War period onwards, the area around Green Pond was a site of extensive mining activity - especially iron mining, which peaked in the 19th century. Currently, there is no active mining in New Jersey. The name &quot;Copperas&quot; (an older term for ferrous sulfate) attests to this history, and the ruins of at least 3 mines are reportedly visible nearby:

* Canfield Mine at the base of Copperas Mountain, where the mined ore was magnetite hosted in Pochuck gneiss.
* Winter Mine, iron in magnetite ore, located east of Green Pond, which opened in 1882 and reopened in the spring of 1885, but closed before 1886. The ore vein was 4 meters wide.
* Pardee Mine, another iron mine in magnetite ore hosted in Poichuck gneiss. Located east of Green Pond at the base of Copperas Mountain, Pardee started about 1870 and closed in 1872, then reopened about 1882 and closed permanently in 1884. This mine reportedly produced 2,500 tons of ore.

==Settlement history==

Before Dutch settlement of northern New Jersey began in the late 17th century, the region was home to the Lenape Native American tribes. However, despite the 18th- and 19th-century mining activity in nearby areas, the Green Pond lakeshore and immediate environs were sparsely populated by permanent residents until the 20th century. Green Pond village, at the north end of the Lake, was a Methodist church summer camp from the 1920s into the 1940s, and many of the village houses that date to this period remain unheated bungalows of the American Craftsman style that are used primarily during the summertime. However, due to pressure from rising real estate costs in the New York City suburbs, these holiday cottages are gradually giving way to year-round dwellings with central heating. Since 1921 the North Shore of the lake has been controlled by the Green Pond Corporation which owns the land with homeowners being shareholders in the corporation. The Green Pond yacht club, the main social presence at Green Pond, was founded in 1937 as the Green Pond Sailing Club and was incorporated in 1944 as the Green Pond Yacht Club. Along the eastern and southern shores of the lake - areas controlled by the rival Lake End Corporation - almost all of the houses are now inhabited year-round. A few houses are accessible only by boat, most notably the Seven Sisters, an isolated cluster of summer houses on the west side of the lake.

== Green Pond Oil Spill ==

The Green Pond Oil Spill was a delayed oil spill that occurred in 1998 due to a flawed 19th-century oil pipeline. The site of the Green Pond Oil Spill took place in Newfoundland, New Jersey just east of Green Pond Road and bounded by the Pequannock River on the north side. The location was previously acquired by Standard Oil Company from 1881 until the facility was torn down in 1920 where they operated the crude oil pumping station situated along the first major oil pipeline from Olean, New York to Bayonne, New Jersey. The pumping station in Newfoundland utilized large three-sided bottomless oil tanks as part of its reinjection system. Historical records indicate that progressive damage to the pipeline was caused by a series of events that led to oil from the tanks seeping into the underlying groundwater and flowing into the river. In 1996, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated a recovery plan and surface cleanup once alerted about potential threats to the public water supply. The site has since officially been reported demobilized and contaminated soil was prevented from entering the Pequannock River due to the installation of Erosion Control Fencing because of the Green Pond Oil Spill Revegetation/Restoration Project conducted by the EPA.

==Notable people==

People who were born in, residents of, or otherwise closely associated with Green Pond include:
* Lou Benfatti (born 1971), former defensive tackle for the New York Jets (1994-1996).
* John Drury Clark, (1907-1988), rocket fuel developer, chemist, and science fiction writer, and his wife Inga Stephens Pratt Clark (1906-1970), artist and illustrator, resided in the Newfoundland section of Green Pond in their later years.
* Lawrence Low (1920–1996), sailor who received a gold medal in the star class with the boat &quot;Kathleen&quot; at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.
* Robert A. Roe (1924-2014), politician who served 11 terms in the United States House of Representatives.

<text>HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched at Bucklers Hard on 20 October 1808, five years after the previous had been broken up.

==Service history==
Her first action came the year after her launch, as part of the Baltic Squadron, in which she assisted in the bombardment of the port of Flushing (Vlissingen) in what is now the Netherlands. The naval bombardment was just a part of a much larger operation; the land force consisted of some 30,000 men, and the objectives were simply to assist the Austrians by invading the Low Countries and to destroy the French Fleet at their believed location of Flushing.

The town of Flushing was actually seized, but the whole invasion soon became irrelevant and pointless, for the French Fleet had actually escaped to the port of Antwerp, and the Austrians had been defeated and were negotiating peace with the French. Over 4,000 British soldiers were killed during the expedition, 106 due to combat, the rest because of an illness known as Walcheren Fever.

Her deployment to the Mediterranean saw &quot;Victorious&quot; engage in her first skirmish against a French warship, on 22 February 1812 in the northern Adriatic Sea during Battle of Pirano, against the French , 74, which was eventually defeated with much of her crew being killed and wounded. &quot;Rivoli&quot; was captured once the skirmish came to an end and she later served in action as a Royal Navy warship against the French. &quot;Victorious&quot; won the lineage its first battle honour during this engagement.

On 12 October 1812 &quot;Victorious&quot;, was at . She was escorting a 30-vessel West Indies-bound convoy.

&quot;Victorious&quot; served as part of Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn&#x27;s fleet in Chesapeake Bay during the War of 1812. She participated in the blockade of the Elizabeth River, keeping at her berth in Norfolk, Virginia during the conflict.

The warship was decommissioned and placed in ordinary at Portsmouth Dockyard in March 1814. She was returned to service as a receiving ship in 1826, and broken up on 21 December 1861.

<text>HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; was one of nine pre-dreadnought battleships of the British Royal Navy. She was armed with a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets, and was capable of a top speed of . She served primarily on home waters, and participated in the Fleet Review for the Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria in 1897. She served briefly in the Mediterranean in 1898 before being transferred to the China Station later that year; &quot;Victorious&quot; remained in East Asian waters until 1900, when she returned to the Mediterranean.

After returning to the United Kingdom in 1904, &quot;Victorious&quot; served as the second flagship of the Channel Fleet. She remained in active service with the fleet in various units until 1908, when she was modernized and then placed in reserve. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 she was mobilized with three of her sister ships into the 9th Battle Squadron, though by January 1915 she was again withdrawn from front-line service. In September her main guns were removed to arm a pair of monitors. &quot;Victorious&quot; was subsequently used as a repair ship. After the end of the war she was renamed &quot;Indus II&quot;; plans to use her as a harbor ship were cancelled and, in April 1923, she was sold for scrap.

== Design ==

&quot;Victorious&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube Scotch marine boilers. By 1907–1908 she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; six of her sisters had the same arrangement, but her sisters and and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes. &quot;Victorious&quot; also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher.

&quot;Victorious&quot; and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel in their belt armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed &quot;Victorious&quot; and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armor, while the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship&#x27;s armored deck was thick.

== Operational history ==

&quot;Victorious&quot; was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 28 May 1894, launched on 19 October 1895—after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy about a year later, on 4 November 1896, for service in the Fleet Reserve at Chatham Dockyard. On 8 June 1897 she went into full commission for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. Before leaving the United Kingdom, she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria on 26 June 1897. She moved to the Mediterranean where she relieved the battleship . In February 1898 &quot;Victorious&quot; was detached from the Mediterranean Fleet for service on the China Station. On 16 February she ran hard aground while entering the harbor at Port Said en route to China. Several tugs attempted to free her but were unable; pump dredgers were needed to shift the sediment around the hull to get her free. She was successfully refloated on 18 February.

In 1900, she returned to the Mediterranean and underwent a refit at Malta. Under the command of Captain Charles Henry Cross, she took part in combined manoeuvres off Cephalonia and Morea in late September and early October 1902. Her Mediterranean service over, &quot;Victorious&quot; was paid off at Chatham on 8 August 1903 and began a refit there that lasted until February 1904. &quot;Victorious&quot; was recommissioned at Devonport on 2 February 1904 to serve as second flagship of the Channel Fleet. On 14 July 1904 the torpedo boat rammed her at Hamoaze, slightly damaging her. When under a reorganization on 1 January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the new Atlantic Fleet, and &quot;Victorious&quot; became an Atlantic Fleet unit.

Captain Robert Falcon Scott, the Antarctic explorer, served as her Captain, acting as Flag Captain to Rear-Admiral George Egerton aboard her, for a period in 1906. Her Atlantic Fleet service ended when she paid off at Devonport on 31 December 1906. On 1 January 1907 &quot;Victorious&quot; was recommissioned to serve at the Nore as part of the Nore Division of the new Home Fleet. She underwent a refit at Chatham in 1908 in which she was converted to burn fuel oil and had main battery fire control and radio installed. She was reduced to a nucleus crew, in commission in reserve, in March 1909. &quot;Victorious&quot; was transferred to the Devonport Division, Home Fleet, in January 1911, and to the 3rd Fleet in May 1912. She damaged her sternwalk in a collision with her sister ship in fog on 14 July 1912 and began a short refit at Chatham in December 1913.

=== First World War ===
In July 1914, the Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilisation as war began to seem imminent. As part of this, &quot;Victorious&quot; and her sister ships , , and , formed the 9th Battle Squadron on 27 July 1914, stationed at the Humber to defend the British coast; &quot;Victorious&quot; remained there as guard ship after the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved on 7 August 1914. In December 1914 she transferred to the Tyne to serve as guard ship there. On 4 January 1915 &quot;Victorious&quot; paid off at Elswick. The &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy; &quot;Victorious&quot; was laid up on the Tyne February until September 1915 and her 12-inch (305-mm) guns were removed for use aboard the new monitors and . Between September 1915 and February 1916, Palmers converted her into a repair ship at Jarrow.

The converted &quot;Victorious&quot; was commissioned as a repair ship on 22 February 1916 and arrived at Scapa Flow to replace the converted merchant ship &quot;Caribbean&quot;, which had been lost in September 1915, as repair ship for the Grand Fleet. &quot;Victorious&quot; performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed &quot;Indus II&quot; and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the Indus Establishment. She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and maintenance status while she awaited the beginning of her refit. Plans for the refit, however, were cancelled; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but, in April 1922, that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month. &quot;Indus II&quot; was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922, but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923. She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped.

<text>Major Force (Clifford Zmeck) is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. Major Force is the evil foil personality of the superhero Captain Atom. In recent years, he also serves as an enemy to Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner, and Hal Jordan).

==Publication history==
Major Force first appeared in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; (vol. 3) #12 (February 1988) and was created by Cary Bates, Greg Weisman, and Pat Broderick.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Major Force is a criminal who is serving a life sentence when the government offers to use him in experiments with Dilustel metal. He becomes an arch-enemy of Captain Atom and occasionally battles the Green Lantern Corps as well.

===Crime and punishment===
In &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #54 (August 1994), Major Force kills Alexandra DeWitt, girlfriend of Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, and leaves her body in a refrigerator for Kyle to find. Guy Gardner kills Major Force, but he proves to be nigh-immortal due to his nature as an energy being and returns on multiple occasions, gaining shapeshifting abilities after being enhanced with Vuldarian DNA.

===Superman/Batman: Public Enemies===
In &quot;Superman/Batman&quot;, Major Force joins a government task force led by Captain Atom alongside Power Girl, Starfire, Katana, and Black Lightning. He is killed with Atom absorbs his energy.

In &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 3) #180 (October 2004), Major Force apparently kills Kyle Rayner&#x27;s mother Maura. Kyle decapitates him and takes his head into space before learning that Maura is alive.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===

Major Force reappears in &quot;Battle for Blüdhaven&quot; as the leader of project S.H.A.D.E. and becomes Hal Jordan&#x27;s enemy before Captain Atom kills him. However, he is later resurrected and joins the Secret Society of Super Villains.

===The New 52===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Major Force is a government agent working under General Wade Eiling, with a special rank that allows him to represent all branches of the military. He seeks to protect Firestorm from villains and convince him to work for the government. However, Major Force comes to view Firestorm as a threat to national security and becomes his enemy.

==Powers and abilities==
Major Force is coated with the same Dilustel alien alloy that covers Captain Atom. This enables him to access the Quantum Field and use its energies for a variety of powers. He possesses superhuman physical abilities and is virtually immortal. Cracking or rupturing his skin causes Major Force to leak radiation at an uncontrollable rate, to which he runs the risk of atomic detonation.

Major Force&#x27;s energy manipulation enables him to generate dark matter, which he uses to propel himself due to initially lacking the ability to fly.

Clifford Zmeck is a military-trained United States Air Force operative. He has vast military connections with the government, Checkmate, Task Force X, and Quorum.

==Other versions==
Q-Ranger, a heroic, alternate universe variant of Major Force from the antimatter universe, appears in &quot;JLA Secret Files&quot; as a member of the Justice Underground.

==In other media==
* Major Force appears in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Powerless!&quot;, voiced by Fred Tatasciore.
* Major Force appears in &quot;Superman/Batman: Public Enemies&quot;, voiced by Ricardo Chavira. This version can fly and his role plays out similarly to the comics version before Power Girl unintentionally kills him.
* Major Force appears as a boss in &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, voiced by Alexander Brandon. This version works for Amanda Waller.
* Major Force appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

<text>The Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin is a daily newspaper serving the area around Binghamton, New York. 

== History ==
The newspaper was formed by the 1985 merger of &quot;The Evening Press&quot; (which was known as &quot;The Binghamton Press&quot; prior to 1960) and &quot;The Sun-Bulletin&quot;. It is owned by Gannett, who purchased &quot;The Binghamton Press&quot; in 1943 and &quot;The Sun-Bulletin&quot; in 1971.

<text>Brian Andrew Greig OAM (born 22 February 1966) is a former Australian politician. Grieg was an Australian Democrats member of the Australian Senate from 1999 to 2005, representing the state of Western Australia.

==Early life==
Greig was born in Fremantle, but his family moved to the small crayfishing village of Lancelin in 1970. He went to primary school there, but received secondary education as a boarder at  Hale School, Perth. He studied Arts (English Literature) at Murdoch University, where he became involved in student politics and editor of student newspaper ‘Metior’. He was elected to the Guild in 1988.

At university, Greig campaigned on the issue of student fees and, in 1986, helped re-establish the National Union of Students. He also began to get involved in gay rights activism during the 1990s, and for several years was spokesperson for Gay and Lesbian Equality (GALE), campaigning for the decriminalisation of homosexuality, anti-discrimination protections and partnership recognition for same-sex couples.

Greig also helped establish the now defunct Australian Council for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1993, the first national lobby of its kind focused on discriminatory commonwealth laws. Campaigns included the successful lifting of the homosexual ban in the military, and recognition of same-sex partners&#x27; right to carer&#x27;s and bereavement leave.

==Political career==
During the 1990s, Greig worked for a range of Australian Labor Party politicians, including Senator Peter Cook, Diana Warnock MLA and Opposition Leaders Ian Taylor MLA and Dr Carmen Lawrence MLA, but became disillusioned with Labor and joined the Democrats. He cited Labor&#x27;s ‘weak’ commitment to LGBTI reform and was attracted to the work in this area by Democrats Senator Sid Spindler, at that time creating on a commonwealth Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Bill.     

Between 1995 and 1999, he was a local-government councillor in the City of Vincent, becoming the first openly gay person elected to public office in Western Australia. At the October 1998 federal election, aged 33, Greig was elected to the Senate. He used his maiden speech to acknowledge his homosexuality, highlight existing areas of discrimination and called for a range of national reforms in this area. It is considered to be the first time a federal politician had spoken so openly and strongly in favour of LGBTI rights, and Grieg has been considered the first LGBTI rights activist elected to federal parliament.

In August 2002, Greig became interim leader of the Australian Democrats for six weeks following the ousting of former leader Natasha Stott Despoja by senators including the party’s deputy, Aden Ridgeway. Ridgeway was expected to become the interim leader, though Greig, a supported of Despoja, made a late challenge appealing to the Democrats governing National Executive to appoint him instead. Greig has been considered to be the first openly gay leader of an Australian political party. Greig was replaced in the resulting leadership ballot by Andrew Bartlett in October, 2002.

In the Senate, Greig had Democrat portfolio responsibilities for Attorney Generals, Justice and Customs; Family and Community Services; Transport; Resources; Fisheries; Disability and Sexuality Issues. He campaigned against internet censorship, and also served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee for the Australian Crime Commission and prompted it to investigate the trafficking of women into the Australian sex industry.

Greig is mostly remembered for his pursuit of LGBTI issues, raising questions with Ministers, moving same-sex amendments to government legislation and triggering speeches from all parties on how to remedy commonwealth inequality against same-sex couples. In 2003, the conservative Howard Government which had opposed his agenda, reluctantly agreed to one of his campaigns and ended discrimination against same-sex couples in private sector Superannuation death benefits. Along with Spindler&#x27;s SOGI Bill, his advocacy across all areas of federal LGBTI discrimination has been credited with laying the foundations for the Rudd Government&#x27;s ‘Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws General Law Reform) Bill 2008.

In 2004, just prior to the election being called, Greig was one of only nine senators to vote against the ban on same-sex marriage by the Howard Government. That legislation triggered a movement for marriage equality that would last another 13 years. The ban was overturned in 2017 and Greig&#x27;s pioneering speech and advocacy from 2004 was acknowledged by sitting senators and referenced in the media.    

During his term in office, Greig introduced three Private Member&#x27;s Bills — one to outlaw genocide in Australia, another to eliminate discrimination against LGBTI people, and another to promote government use of open source software. All were blocked by the Liberal–National government. Greig stood for re-election at the 2004 election, but lost his seat to Rachel Siewert of the Australian Greens. His term expired 30 June 2005.

==Post-political career==

Since leaving parliament, Greig has worked as a Communications Manager for the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia and in media operations for Anglicare WA and the Department of Fire and Emergency Services. He continues with social commentary in platforms such as On Line Opinion and Crikey, as well as publishing articles in mainstream media including for &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Greig maintained his LGBTI advocacy, serving as the WA Representative to Australian Marriage Equality between 2013 and 2016 and is currently WA spokesperson for lobby group Just-Equal Australia. On 13 June 2011, Greig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community as a social justice advocate for the gay and lesbian community.

In 2019, Greig moved to Busselton WA. That year, he unsuccessfully stood for Busselton City Council in 2019. He is self-employed in consulting and works for the hospitality sector. He is chairperson of local LGBTI advocacy group Busselton Pride Alliance, and is also a founding member of the LGBTIQ advocacy group Just-Equal Australia.

<doc id="967353" wikidata="Q1398892" url="?curid=967353" title="R. H. Bing">
<text>R. H. Bing (October 20, 1914 – April 28, 1986) was an American mathematician who worked mainly in the areas of geometric topology and continuum theory. His father was named Rupert Henry, but Bing&#x27;s mother thought that &quot;Rupert Henry&quot; was too British for Texas. She compromised by abbreviating it to R. H. Consequently, R. H. does not stand for a first or middle name.

==Mathematical contributions==

Bing&#x27;s mathematical research was almost exclusively in 3-manifold theory and in particular, the geometric topology of formula_1. The term Bing-type topology was coined to describe the style of methods used by Bing.

Bing established his reputation early on in 1946, soon after completing his Ph.D. dissertation, by solving the Kline sphere characterization problem. In 1948 he proved that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous, contradicting a published but erroneous &#x27;proof&#x27; to the contrary.

In 1951, he proved results regarding the metrizability of topological spaces, including what would later be called the Bing–Nagata–Smirnov metrization theorem.

In 1952, Bing showed that the double of a solid Alexander horned sphere was the 3-sphere. This showed the existence of an involution on the 3-sphere with fixed point set equal to a wildly embedded 2-sphere, which meant that the original Smith conjecture needed to be phrased in a suitable category. This result also jump-started research into crumpled cubes. The proof involved a method later developed by Bing and others into set of techniques called Bing shrinking. Proofs of the generalized Schoenflies conjecture and the double suspension theorem relied on Bing-type shrinking.

Bing was fascinated by the Poincaré conjecture and made several major attacks which ended unsuccessfully, contributing to the reputation of the conjecture as a very difficult one. He did show that a simply connected, closed 3-manifold with the property that every loop was contained in a 3-ball is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Bing was responsible for initiating research into the Property P conjecture, as well as its name, as a potentially more tractable version of the Poincaré conjecture. It was proven in 2004 as a culmination of work from several areas of mathematics. With some irony, this proof was announced some time after Grigori Perelman announced his proof of the Poincaré conjecture.

The side-approximation theorem was considered by Bing to be one of his key discoveries. It has many applications, including a simplified proof of Moise&#x27;s theorem, which states that every 3-manifold can be triangulated in an essentially unique way.

===Notable examples===
====The house with two rooms====
The &quot;house with two rooms&quot; is a contractible 2-complex that is not collapsible. Another such example, popularized by E.C. Zeeman, is the &quot;dunce hat&quot;.

The house with two rooms can also be thickened and then triangulated to be unshellable, despite the thickened house topologically being a 3-ball. The house with two rooms shows up in various ways in topology. For example, it is used in the proof that every compact 3-manifold has a standard spine.

====Dogbone space====
The &quot;dogbone space&quot; is the quotient space obtained from a cellular decomposition of formula_1 into points and polygonal arcs. The quotient space, formula_3, is not a manifold, but formula_4 is homeomorphic to formula_5.

==Service and educational contributions==

Bing was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1957–58 and again in 1962–63.

Bing served as president of the MAA (1963–1964), president of the AMS (1977–78), and was department chair at University of Wisconsin, Madison (1958–1960), and at University of Texas at Austin (1975–1977).

Before entering graduate school to study mathematics, Bing graduated from Southwest Texas State Teacher&#x27;s College (known today as Texas State University), and was a high-school teacher for several years. His interest in education would persist for the rest of his life.

==Awards and honors==

*Member of the National Academy of Sciences (1965)
*Lester R. Ford Award from the MAA (1965)
*Chairman of Division of Mathematics of the National Research Council (1967–1969)
*United States delegate to the International Mathematical Union (1966, 1978)
*Colloquium Lecturer of the American Mathematical Society (1970)
*Award for Distinguished Service to Mathematics from the Mathematical Association of America (1974)
*Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1980)

==What does R. H. stand for?==

As mentioned in the introduction, Bing&#x27;s father was named Rupert Henry, but Bing&#x27;s mother thought that &quot;Rupert Henry&quot; was too British for Texas. Thus she compromised by abbreviating it to R. H. 

It is told that once Bing was applying for a visa and was requested not to use initials. He explained that his name was really &quot;R-only H-only Bing&quot;, and ended up receiving a visa made out to &quot;Ronly Honly Bing&quot;.

<text>Cotswold Rail was an English company, based in Gloucester, which arranged the spot-hire of shunting and mainline locomotives.

==History==


Cotswold Rail was founded in 2000, initially as a broker for rolling stock. In June 2000, it offered 13 Class 141 &quot;Pacers&quot; for sale.

In 2001, some Class 08 shunting locomotives were purchased, which were hired to both industry and main-line railway companies.

Cotswold Rail also purchased a fleet of Class 47 locomotives. From June 2002 until June 2009, it provided Class 47s for Anglia Railways (and its successor National Express East Anglia), as rescue locomotives, and to haul Mark 2 sets on summer Saturday services from Norwich to Great Yarmouth.

In 2004, Cotswold Rail leased 12 former Virgin Trains Mark 3 carriages from Rolling stock company Porterbrook.

In April 2005, the company acquired leased some Class 87 electric locomotives. A fleet of ten locomotives was planned, for spot-hire work, charter operations, and a new intermodal freight flow. However, all locomotives were returned to the leasing company (Porterbrook) in 2006.

In September 2005, two former Virgin CrossCountry High Speed Train sets were leased. These were returned in August 2006.

In 2005, Cotswold Rail purchased Advenza Freight, primarily for its safety case, which allowed it to operate freight services. In 2007, the railtour promoter, Steamy Affairs, was purchased.

As a result of HM Revenue &amp; Customs successfully applying in October 2009 to have Advenza Freight wound up over unpaid taxes, Cotswold Rail entered voluntary administration in January 2010.

==Fleet==
Cotswold Rail&#x27;s livery adopted a silver livery, with red and blue bands. It named its locomotives after geographical features, such as Cam Peak and the Fosse Way, or after music industry personalities, namely John Peel, Joe Strummer and Captain Sensible.

==Depot==
In 2006, Cotswold Rail leased the closed Gloucester Horton Road depot. The facility, which had last been used in 1992, was next to Gloucester station. It was also the location of the company offices, and usually played host to stabled company-owned locomotives.

==Blue Pullman==
In 2007, Cotswold Rail acquired rights to the Blue Pullman service, setting up The Blue Pullman Train Co, using Blue Pullman-liveried coaches purchased following the receivership of the previous operator, FM Rail. Cotswold re-launched the Blue Pullman service in February 2007, using its silver Class 47s.

<text>Ara Raoul Parseghian (; ; May 21, 1923 – August 2, 2017) was an American football coach and player who coached the University of Notre Dame to national championships in 1966 and 1973. He is noted for bringing Notre Dame&#x27;s Fighting Irish football program back from years of futility into national prominence in 1964 and is regarded alongside Knute Rockne and Frank Leahy as a part of the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of Notre Dame head coaches.

Parseghian grew up in Akron, Ohio, and played football beginning in his junior year of high school. He enrolled at the University of Akron, but soon quit to join the U.S. Navy for two years during World War II. After the war, he finished his college career at Miami University in Ohio and went on to play halfback for the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference in 1948 and 1949. Cleveland won the league championship both of those years.

Parseghian&#x27;s playing career was cut short by a hip injury. He left the Browns and took a job as an assistant coach at Miami of Ohio. When head coach Woody Hayes left in 1951 to coach at Ohio State University, Parseghian took over his job. He stayed in that position until 1956, when he was hired as head coach at Northwestern University in Illinois. In eight seasons there, he amassed a win-loss-tie record of 36–35–1 and helped turn a perennial loser into a consistent contender in the national polls.

Parseghian&#x27;s success attracted the interest of Notre Dame, which had not posted a winning record in five straight seasons. He was hired as head coach in 1964 and quickly turned the program around, coming close to capturing a national championship in his first year. He proceeded to win two national titles in 11 seasons as coach of the Fighting Irish, a period often referred to as &quot;the Era of Ara&quot;. During that span, Parseghian&#x27;s teams placed in the top ten of the final AP poll nine times and never finished lower than 14th. He never had a losing season at Notre Dame and posted an overall record of 95–17–4, giving him the fourth-most wins of any coach in school history after Rockne (105), Brian Kelly (101) and Lou Holtz (100). Parseghian&#x27;s .836 winning percentage while at Notre Dame ranks behind only Rockne&#x27;s .881 and Leahy&#x27;s .855, leading to his inclusion in the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of Fighting Irish coaches.

Parseghian retired from coaching in 1974 and began a broadcasting career calling college football games for ABC and CBS. He also dedicated himself to medical causes later in life after his daughter was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and three of his grandchildren died of a rare genetic disease. Parseghian was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1980. His career coaching record is 170–58–6.

==Early life and high school==
Parseghian was the youngest of three children born to an Armenian father and a French mother in Akron, Ohio. His father Michael had come to the United States from the Ottoman Empire in 1915, fleeing the Armenian genocide during World War I and settling in Akron where there was a sizeable Armenian population. Despite his mother&#x27;s protectiveness, Parseghian became involved in sports from an early age and developed a reputation as the toughest kid in his class. He was hired by Akron&#x27;s Board of Education in the eighth grade to patrol his school&#x27;s grounds at night to deter vandals.

Parseghian played basketball at the local YMCA but did not play organized football until his junior year at South High School in Akron because his mother would not allow him to participate in contact sports. He joined his high school team, coached by Frank &quot;Doc&quot; Wargo, initially without his parents&#x27; permission.

==College and professional career==
After graduating in 1942, Parseghian enrolled at the University of Akron. American involvement in World War II began after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, however, and he quit school to join the U.S. Navy. The Navy transferred him for training to Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago, where Paul Brown was coaching a service football team. Brown was a well-known high school coach in Ohio, having led his Massillon Washington High School teams to a series of state championships. Parseghian was named the team&#x27;s starting fullback before the 1944 season, but he was sidelined with an ankle injury and did not play in any games as Great Lakes amassed a 9–2–1 record and was ranked 17th in the nation in the AP Poll. Parseghian later said that despite not playing, watching Brown&#x27;s methodical and strict coaching methods – and the ease with which he commanded players much larger than he was – was a &quot;priceless&quot; experience.

After his military service, Parseghian enrolled at Miami of Ohio and played halfback on the school&#x27;s football team in 1946 and 1947 under coach Sid Gillman. As with Brown, Parseghian paid close attention to Gillman, a post-war football pioneer who helped popularize deep downfield passes as the T formation came into vogue. He was named an All-Ohio halfback and a Little All-American by sportswriters in 1947.

Parseghian was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League in the 13th round of the 1947 draft. He was also selected by the Cleveland Browns of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, his old Great Lakes coach. Parseghian left Miami with six semester credit hours remaining and signed with the Browns.

Parseghian played halfback and defensive back for the Browns starting in 1948. While he only started one game that season, he was part of a potent offensive backfield that featured quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The Browns won all of their games and a third straight AAFC championship in 1948. Parseghian suffered a serious injury to his hip in the second game of the 1949 season against the Baltimore Colts, however, ending his playing career. He stayed with the Browns for the rest of the season, and the team went on to win another AAFC championship. With the Browns, he had 44 carries for 166 yards, three receptions for 33 yards, scored two touchdowns, and intercepted one pass.

==Coaching career==

===Miami (Ohio)===
Parseghian&#x27;s injury and the end of his professional playing career were a source of frustration, but he soon got the chance to move into the coaching ranks. Woody Hayes, the head coach at Miami of Ohio, contacted him about a job as coach of the freshman team. He was recommended for the position by athletic director John Brickels, who had been an assistant coach with the Browns in 1948. Parseghian led the freshmen to a 4–0 record in the 1950 season and was chosen the following year as Hayes&#x27;s successor when Hayes departed to become head coach at Ohio State University.

Parseghian&#x27;s teams at Miami consistently did well in the Mid-American Conference, posting a 7–3 record in 1951 and improving to 8–1 the following year. Miami&#x27;s Redskins (now known as RedHawks) were conference champions in 1954 and in 1955, when they went undefeated. Parseghian&#x27;s success, which included two wins over larger Big Ten Conference schools, raised his profile nationally as a head coaching prospect. In late 1955, he was hired to coach at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, one of the Big Ten schools Miami had beaten. Parseghian compiled a 39–6–1 record in five seasons at Miami.

===Northwestern===
Northwestern&#x27;s football program was in transition when Parseghian arrived in 1956 to take over the coaching reins. Bob Voigts had quit as head coach in February 1955, leaving his assistant Lou Saban to guide the team. Under Saban, a former Browns teammate of Parseghian&#x27;s, Northwestern finished at 0–8–1, the worst-ever record in its history at the time. Ted Payseur, the school&#x27;s athletic director, resigned after the season under pressure from alumni and was replaced by Stu Holcomb. One of Holcomb&#x27;s first moves was to fire Saban and replace him with Parseghian.

Parseghian was the 20th head coach of the Northwestern Wildcats football team and was the youngest coach in the Big Ten when he took the job at 32 years old. His Northwestern career began in 1956 with just one win in his first six games. The Wildcats put together three wins at the end of the season, however, and finished with a 4–4–1 record. Northwestern proceeded to lose all nine of its games in the 1957 season. Bo Schembechler—a member of the 1957 Northwestern staff and teammate of Parshegian&#x27;s at Miami—called Parshegian&#x27;s performance during the 1957 season the best job of coaching Schembechler ever witnessed. Despite the losses (many of them by close margins), Parshegian kept his team united and focused. That crucible set the stage for a much more successful campaign in 1958, when Northwestern finished with a 5–4 record that included victories over conference rivals Michigan and Ohio State.

Northwestern began the 1959 season in the top ten in the AP Poll and started with a 45–13 win over Oklahoma, then the top-ranked team in the country. It was the first of a string of victories that propelled Northwestern to the number-two spot in the AP Poll. Led by quarterback John Talley and star halfback Ron Burton, the team beat Michigan again and won a match-up in October against Notre Dame, a school Northwestern had not played since 1948. Three straight losses at the end of the season ended the team&#x27;s run at the conference championship, however.

The following four seasons brought a mix of success and challenges. Parseghian&#x27;s best year at Northwestern was in 1962, when the team finished at 7–2. Parseghian was a shrewd recruiter, using Northwestern&#x27;s small budget to find versatile players overlooked by the bigger rival programs. In 1962, he put his faith in sophomore quarterback Tom Myers to guide the team. Myers, aided by a big offensive line and by star receiver Paul Flatley, led a passing attack that helped Northwestern to the top of the AP Poll in the middle of the season following wins against Ohio State and Notre Dame. Parseghian called the close win against Hayes and Ohio State &quot;one of Northwestern&#x27;s greatest victories&quot;. The following week&#x27;s Notre Dame game drew a 55,752 people, which remained the largest crowd ever to see a home game at Northwestern as of 2005. Despite those wins, late-season losses to Michigan State and Wisconsin cost the team a chance at the Big Ten championship.

At Northwestern, Parseghian developed a reputation as an affable, down-to-earth coach. While he took his job seriously, he cultivated an informal rapport with players, who called him &quot;Ara&quot; rather than &quot;coach&quot; or &quot;Mr. Parseghian&quot;. Given his closeness in age to many of the players, he &quot;empathizes with us well&quot;, Northwestern tackle Andy Cvercko said in 1959. Parseghian occasionally joined in practices with the players and organized games of touch football. He had other quirks, like lowering the intensity of practices as game day approached to let the players &quot;build up psychologically&quot;, something he learned from Paul Brown.

Parseghian remained at Northwestern for eight seasons until 1963. His career coaching record there was 36–35–1. This ranks him third at Northwestern in total wins and ninth at Northwestern in winning percentage. Parseghian&#x27;s teams beat Notre Dame four straight times after their annual series was renewed in 1959 following a decade-long hiatus.

Toward the end of his tenure at Northwestern, Parseghian grew frustrated by the school&#x27;s limited financial resources, curbs on football scholarships, and academic standards for athletes that were more stringent than at other Big Ten schools. He also clashed with athletic director Holcomb, who told him in 1963 that his contract would not be renewed after that season despite coaching the team to within two wins of a national championship the previous year. &quot;I took them to the top of the polls in 1962, and that was not good enough for Northwestern&quot;, Parseghian said many years later.

===Notre Dame===
Parseghian&#x27;s coaching career at Northwestern was approaching its end in 1963. In November of that year, he called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana. He asked whether interim head football coach Hugh Devore was going to be given the job on a longer-term basis. When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed an interest in the job. Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami in Florida, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father&#x27;s misguided anti-Catholicism, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).

Parseghian&#x27;s candidacy for the head coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual because he was not a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Before hiring Parseghian, Joyce made it clear that he did not care about Parseghian&#x27;s religion but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.

As had been the case at Northwestern, Notre Dame&#x27;s football program was in a state of flux when Parseghian arrived. Notre Dame had built a proud history under Rockne and Frank Leahy (its two most successful coaches), but the late 1950s and early 1960s had been a disaster. The team had finished 5–5 in 1962 under Joe Kuharich, who lost the confidence of his players and Notre Dame&#x27;s administrators during his four years as coach. Kuharich&#x27;s surprise departure at the end of that season to become supervisor of officials in the National Football League, a position created by his friend and NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, left the program in disarray. Devore, a long-time Notre Dame employee who had played for Rockne and coached under Leahy, was brought in to lead the team on an interim basis in 1963. Notre Dame managed only a 2–7 finish that year.

====Turnaround and the 1964 season====
Parseghian quickly turned the program around in 1964; he re-established a sense of confidence and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized with the help of a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players&#x27; concerns about the program and addressed them. He invigorated the team&#x27;s offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.

Parseghian also recognized talent in quarterback John Huarte and wide receiver Jack Snow, who had been used only sparingly for two seasons by previous coaches. Huarte could throw far and accurately but was soft-spoken, a trait Parseghian and his staff helped change. Snow was large for a receiver of his era, but Parseghian thought his athleticism and sure hands would make him a good wideout. Still, expectations were muted for the 1964 season: Parseghian told his coaches that the team would have a 6–4 record if they were lucky. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; predicted a 5–5 record at best, and the team did not rank among the top 20 programs in the country in the pre-season AP Poll.

Notre Dame nonetheless opened the season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team&#x27;s leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss unseated Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.

Huarte passed for 2,062 yards and set 12 school records in 1964, four of which still stood as of 2009. He also won the Heisman Trophy. Snow led the country in receptions with 60. At the same time, Parseghian won numerous coach of the year awards for engineering the turnaround, including from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association of America, the Washington Touchdown Club, the Columbus Touchdown Club, and &quot;Football News&quot;.

Huarte and Snow graduated after the 1964 season, and Notre Dame felt their absence the following year, posting a 7–2–1 record. While the team did not contend for a national title, defensive back Nick Rassas led the nation in punt returns and came in sixth in interceptions; he was named a first-team All-American by sportswriters.

====First national title====
In 1966, Parseghian guided Notre Dame to its first national championship since the Leahy era. Led by quarterback Terry Hanratty, running back Nick Eddy, star receiver Jim Seymour, and fullback Larry Conjar, the offense was best in the nation in scoring, with an average of 36.2 points per game. The defense was second in the country in points allowed, thanks to strong performances by linebacker Jim Lynch and defensive end Alan Page.

The season began with eight straight victories, propelling Notre Dame to the top of the national polls. The team then faced Michigan State, which was ranked second in the polls and was also undefeated. The contest, one among a number referred to as the &quot;game of the century&quot;, ended in a 10–10 tie. Parseghian was criticized for winding down the clock instead of trying to score despite having the ball in the final seconds of the game. He defended his strategy by maintaining that several key starters had been knocked out of action early in the game and that he did not want to spoil a courageous comeback from a 10–0 deficit by risking a turnover deep in his own territory late in the game. When Parseghian&#x27;s team trounced USC 51–0 the following week, critics alleged that he ran up the score to impress poll voters who had split the number-one ranking between Notre Dame and Michigan State following the tie. Subsequent to the USC rout, the final wire service polls gave Parseghian&#x27;s team the national championship, although Notre Dame continued its policy of not participating in a post-season bowl game. Nine members of the team were selected as All-Americans, and Parseghian was named coach of the year by &quot;Sporting News&quot;.

Several winning seasons followed, but Notre Dame did not repeat as national champion in the late 1960s. In 1969, the team finished with an 8–2–1 record and accepted an invitation to play in the postseason Cotton Bowl. With this game, the school ended a long-standing policy of not playing in bowl games. The university urgently needed money to fund minority scholarships and decided to use the proceeds from bowl games for this purpose. Parseghian&#x27;s team lost the game, 21–17, to the eventual national champion Texas Longhorns.

====Later Notre Dame career====
Notre Dame continued to succeed under Parseghian in the early 1970s. Led by senior quarterback Joe Theismann, the team finished second in the polls in 1970 and avenged its Cotton Bowl loss, defeating the Longhorns 24–11 in an upset. In 1973, Parseghian had a perfect season and won a second national championship, topped off by a 24–23 win over Alabama in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but Alabama had held the top spot in the national polls. Parseghian was named Coach of the Year by &quot;Football News&quot;.

Before the start of the 1974 season, several key defensive players were suspended for allegations of sexual misconduct, but charges were never filed. Parseghian called the loss of those key defensive players &quot;a great disappointment&quot;. Several other key players were injured. An upset loss to underdog Purdue in the third game of the season derailed the team&#x27;s hopes to repeat as national champions. The ever-present pressure to win took its toll. In the middle of the season, Parseghian privately decided to resign for the sake of his health. He was also dealing with the deaths of three close friends that year as well as his daughter&#x27;s battle with multiple sclerosis. He officially stepped down in mid-December after rumors began to surface that he was leaving for a post with another college program or professional team. He said he was &quot;physically exhausted and emotionally drained&quot; after 25 years of coaching and needed a break. His last game was Notre Dame&#x27;s 13–11 win in a rematch against Alabama in the Orange Bowl. After 11 seasons as head coach of the Fighting Irish, he was succeeded by Dan Devine. His record at Notre Dame was 95–17–4, giving him the second-most wins by any football coach in 
the school&#x27;s history, trailing only Knute Rockne.

Parseghian, who was 51 at the time, said he planned to take at least a year off from coaching before considering a run at a job in the professional ranks. Rumors circulated throughout 1975 that he might return to Notre Dame, but both he and Devine denied them. In December, he finally decided that he would not coach in 1976 despite reportedly being pursued by the New York Jets of the NFL. He would instead host a television show beginning the following fall. He made his last appearance on the sidelines when he coached the college players in the annual Chicago College All-Star Game against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers on July 23, 1976, at Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field. The game was halted with 1:22 remaining in the third quarter when a torrential thunderstorm broke out; after fans rushed onto the field, play was never resumed. It was the last such game ever played.

During Parseghian&#x27;s tenure at Notre Dame, the school&#x27;s long-dormant football rivalry with Michigan was revived through an agreement signed in 1970. The schools, which had not met since 1943, agreed to resume the series with the 1978 season. Notre Dame athletic director Moose Krause orchestrated the deal with Don Canham, his counterpart at Michigan, but Parseghian&#x27;s friendship with Wolverine head coach Bo Schembechler also played a role. Parseghian and Schembechler were teammates at Miami University in Ohio, and Schembechler served on Parseghian&#x27;s staff at Northwestern in 1956 and 1957. Schembechler told Parseghian in 1970 that he was looking forward to facing Notre Dame, but Parseghian replied that he would &quot;never have that opportunity&quot;.

While at Notre Dame, Parseghian did away with all ornamentation on players&#x27; uniforms, eliminating shamrocks and shoulder stripes and switched the team&#x27;s home jerseys to navy blue. The Irish never wore green jerseys during his tenure. His successful run at Notre Dame is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Era of Ara&quot;.

==Later life==

Parseghian launched a broadcasting career after leaving Notre Dame. He served as a color analyst for ABC Sports from 1975 to 1981 covering a series of regional and national college football games. He moved to CBS Sports in 1982 and covered college games for that network until 1988.

Parseghian, who amassed a career coaching record of 170–58–6 at Miami, Northwestern and Notre Dame, was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980. He was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame as part of its charter class in 1969 and became a member of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1984. He was also inducted into the Cotton Bowl Classic Hall of Fame in 2007. Parseghian was awarded an honorary doctorate in humanities by Miami in 1978 and served on the school&#x27;s board of trustees between 1978 and 1987. He also received an honorary degree from Notre Dame in 1997 and won the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award the same year for his contributions to the sport.

Jason Miller portrayed Parseghian in the 1993 film &quot;Rudy&quot;, which chronicled Rudy Ruettiger&#x27;s determination to overcome his small size and dyslexia and play for Notre Dame in 1974. Parseghian saw Ruettiger&#x27;s drive and placed him on the scout team but resigned at the end of the year. Devine, Parseghian&#x27;s successor, put Ruettiger in on defense at the end of the final game of the 1975 season, and Ruettiger recorded a sack.

Along with Lou Holtz, Parseghian served as one of two honorary coaches in Notre Dame&#x27;s 2007 spring game, an annual scrimmage held in April. Holtz&#x27;s Gold team defeated Parseghian&#x27;s Blue team, 10–6. The same year, Notre Dame unveiled a statue in Parseghian&#x27;s honor by sculptor Jerry McKenna, depicting players carrying him off the field in triumph following the 1971 Cotton Bowl victory over Texas; the statue as of 2024 is next to Notre Dame Stadium at Gate B, which is also called the Ara Parseghian Gate. In 2011, Miami also unveiled a statue in his honor to add to the RedHawks&#x27; Cradle of Coaches plaza. It shows him wearing a Notre Dame sweater as he kneels and looks ahead to the field.

Parseghian, who was married to the former Kathleen Davis, also became involved with medical causes later in life. Along with Mike and Cindy Parseghian, his son and daughter-in-law, he founded the Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation in 1994. The foundation is seeking a cure for Niemann-Pick disease Type C, a genetic disorder affecting children that causes the buildup of cholesterol in cells, resulting in damage to the nervous system and eventually death. Three of his grandchildren, Michael, Marcia, and Christa Parseghian, died from the disease. He was also active in the cause to find a cure for multiple sclerosis; his daughter Karan was diagnosed with the disease.

Parseghian died on August 2, 2017, surrounded by his family at his home in Granger, Indiana, at the age of 94. At the time of his death, he was suffering from an infection that had settled into his hip. He was buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery in Notre Dame, Indiana.

<doc id="967367" wikidata="Q5949967" url="?curid=967367" title="Hustle (2004 film)">
<text>Hustle is a television film about the baseball player Pete Rose, created by ESPN Films. It was first broadcast on September 25, 2004. The movie follows Rose as he gambled on Major League Baseball while managing the Cincinnati Reds, was caught and banned from baseball for life. The title is a reference to both Rose&#x27;s gambling problem and his nickname, &quot;Charlie Hustle&quot;.

The movie stars Tom Sizemore as Pete Rose and was directed by Peter Bogdanovich.

==Production==
The script was largely based on the Dowd Report without Rose&#x27;s involvement.

Major League Baseball did not approve the script or co-operate with the producers. ESPN was not given permission to use the uniforms, logos or trademarks of the Cincinnati Reds.

The job of directing was given to Peter Bogdanovich even though he was not a baseball fan. He was interested in that Pete Rose &quot;is Dostoyevskian, a degenerate gambler. It&#x27;s intriguing when somebody has an obsession he can&#x27;t seem to cope with. With all the great things he accomplished, he screwed up his life. It&#x27;s sad and fascinating.&quot; Bogdanovich thought the story was &quot;very American... We build people up to such a degree in this country, they think they are outside the law. We honor celebrity to a fault... Then we&#x27;re just as quick to tear them down.&quot;

&quot;Peter&#x27;s name is synonymous with excellence in film direction,&quot; said Ron Semaio of ESPN Original Entertainment. &quot;His visionary and creative approach is well documented and hugely successful.&quot;

Bogdanovich said Rose &quot;created an atmosphere around himself that was outside society, outside the law... [He] was operating on another level. There was a secret life there. People were living with lies. He traveled with not very distinguished company.&quot;

The lead role was played by Tom Sizemore, who Bogdanovich said would &quot;be unbelievably great.. This is the right moment in his life to turn in a great performance. This role requires nuance. It&#x27;s not a black-and-white kind of person. There are lots of colors.&quot;

Sizemore was on bail while making the film. Bogdanovich says ESPN gave him a few days of rehearsal with Sizemore in order to &quot;make him feel wanted and OK... He had been traumatized a bit by what had been happening to him. He&#x27;s a sensitive guy.&quot;

Filming started in Toronto on May 17, 2004. It was shot over three weeks. &quot;I&#x27;m pleased with it,&quot; said Bogdanovich. &quot;I believe the film to be well-written and well-researched.&quot;

<text>Kerri Irvin-Ross is a former Canadian politician in Manitoba. A member of the New Democratic Party, she served as a cabinet minister under premiers Gary Doer and Greg Selinger, including as deputy premier in Selinger&#x27;s government from 2015 to 2016.

Irvin-Ross defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Member of the Legislative Assembly Joy Smith by 87 votes in the riding of Fort Garry in the 2003 general election. She defeated Progressive Conservative challenger Shaun McCaffrey in Fort Garry by 4,291 to 2,101 in the 2007 general election. Manitoba&#x27;s decennial electoral redistribution of 2008 abolished Fort Garry. In the 2011 general election, Irvin-Ross chose to run in the newly created constituency of Fort Richmond, which comprised most of the southern part of her previous riding, and was re-elected over McCaffrey by 4,026 votes to 2,908. Irvin-Ross was defeated in the 2016 election, losing her seat to PC candidate Sarah Guillemard.

In 2006, Irvin-Ross joined Doer&#x27;s cabinet as Minister of Healthy Living, holding the post until Doer&#x27;s retirement in 2009. In 2009, shortly after he was sworn in as premier, Selinger named her to the new portfolio of Minister of Housing and Community Development. In 2013, she became Minister of Family Services and Minister responsible for Status of Women, which she held until 2016; she also briefly regained Housing and Community development from 2014 to 2015. In 2016, she was named Minister responsible for Persons with Disabilities and Minister responsible for the Civil Service, and in 2016 she became Deputy Premier of Manitoba. She held all three roles until the government&#x27;s defeat in the 2016 election.

<doc id="967370" wikidata="Q842502" url="?curid=967370" title="Medúlla">
<text>Medúlla is the fifth studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk. It was released on 30 August 2004 in the United Kingdom by One Little Indian Records and in the United States by Elektra Entertainment. After the release of her electronic-influenced previous album &quot;Vespertine&quot; (2001), Björk intended to make an album almost entirely constructed with human vocals, in contrast to the previous album&#x27;s intense process of composition and multiple layers of instrumentation. The album&#x27;s title derives from the Latin word for &quot;marrow&quot;.

&quot;Medúlla&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics, with many calling it &quot;unique&quot;, although others deemed it &quot;confusing&quot;. The album was not as commercially successful as her previous albums, but did reach number one in France, Iceland and Wallonia, whilst also peaking within the top ten in the United Kingdom. &quot;Medúlla&quot; is estimated to have sold more than a million copies worldwide, and received two nominations at the 47th Grammy Awards.

Two singles were released from &quot;Medúlla&quot;: &quot;Who Is It&quot; and &quot;Triumph of a Heart&quot;, with both charting inside the top 40 in the United Kingdom and the top 10 in Spain. Björk further promoted the album by performing the song &quot;Oceania&quot; at the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; and other television and radio shows. Other than these few performances, no concerts or tours were arranged to promote &quot;Medúlla&quot;, as Björk thought it would be too difficult to play the songs live. In 2015, the album was adapted into an opera at the Brussels opera house La Monnaie by Sjaron Minailo and Anat Spiegel.

==Background and production==
Björk began working on her fifth studio album in 2002, being known as &quot;The Lake Album&quot; at the time. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, she explained that she wanted to get away from the world of instruments and electronics present on her previous album, &quot;Vespertine&quot; (2001), and remarked that the project was &quot;very introverted&quot; and avoided eye contact. When she was finishing &quot;Vespertine&quot;, Björk knew she wanted to make a vocal album, and had known since her teenage years that one day she would. For her, the majority of the album is connected to the time when she was 17 to 18 years old, focusing on aspects of life, love, family, and friends. She commented that she was thinking about how she used to live her life, how carefree she was, and how others around her affected the way she thought, saying it is shown clearly at the core of &quot;Medúlla&quot;. Björk began working on the album while eight months pregnant by adding her own live drumming to the arrangements of previously recorded demos. She then started muting the instruments, and liked the result of it. She was inspired by paganism, and the idea of returning to a universe that is entirely human, without tools or religion or nationalities. &quot;I wanted the record to be like muscle, blood, flesh. We could be in a cave somewhere and one person would start singing, and another person would sing a beat and then the next person sing a melody, and you could just kind of be really happy in your cave. It&#x27;s quite rootsy&quot;, she added.
Tanya Tagaq, an Inuit throat singer who worked with Björk on her 2001 Vespertine world tour, was also featured. Björk was so impressed with her voice&#x27;s ability that she invited Tagaq to work with her on the album. She asked British singer Robert Wyatt to be a featured vocalist on the album, as she was looking for something more &quot;passionate&quot; and &quot;human&quot;. Additionally, the musician &quot;wanted a bit of rock&quot; on &quot;Medúlla&quot;, so she invited singer Mike Patton of rock band Faith No More. Björk also invited the London and Icelandic choirs, in order to have a classical feel on the album. However, the &quot;musical fascist&quot; in her decided using any MCs or vocal percussionists would be too &quot;cheesy&quot;; she later changed her mind when she saw beatboxer Rahzel from The Roots freestyle a whole Kraftwerk track without pausing for breath. Björk found his voice &quot;above and beyond any cliché&quot; and thought he was perfect for the album&#x27;s beat-based songs. Another beatboxer, Dokaka, was invited after Björk got a link to his webpage and liked his covers so much that she decided to work with him; he appears on a few songs.

American singer Beyoncé was planned to be featured on the album as well, but she did not appear due to scheduling issues. When asked what she liked about Beyoncé, Björk stated that &quot;[&quot;Medúlla&quot;] is an album about voices, and she&#x27;s got the most amazing voice.&quot;

==Artwork and title==

The album cover for &quot;Medúlla&quot; was photographed by duo Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin in London, on 28 June 2004, and designed by M/M Paris. It features Björk wearing a mask made of hair, which was made specifically for the shoot, a black dress and a necklace that is made of black &quot;bones&quot; that says &quot;Medúlla&quot;. The hair mask was created by Icelandic artist Shoplifter. The artist stated that in 2004, she had a show at ATM Gallery, where she displayed a wall mural made of brown braids. Björk appreciated it, and then invited her to work on creating a hair sculpture for the &quot;Medúlla&quot;″s character. She also explained that the singer wanted it to have a darkness about it, and then she sent Björk several references of extreme hairstyles, and because the album was made with voices, Björk wanted something that was part of the human body.

Van Lamsweerde said that they &quot;were all inspired by women&#x27;s handicrafts and this idea of being in your own cocoon in your home, with your family, and this reclusive character that hand-makes the whole world around her&quot;. The hairpiece was part of her 2015 MoMA retrospective. In an interview with &quot;Style&quot; magazine, Shoplifter talked about her part at the exhibition, explaining that it dedicated a room to each album of Björk&#x27;s career, with the &quot;Medúlla&quot; section having a mannequin wearing the hairmask and the dress designed by Alexander McQueen which she wore in the music video for &quot;Who Is It&quot;.

The title was announced in June 2004 through Björk&#x27;s official website. She had struggled to choose a suitable title while preparing the album. She said that something in her &quot;wanted to leave out civilisation, to rewind to before it all happened and work out, &#x27;Where is the human soul? What if we do without civilisation and religion and patriotism, without the stuff that has gone wrong?&#x27;&quot; She provisionally called it &quot;Ink&quot;, a title that suggested to her the idea of &quot;that black, 5,000-year-old blood that&#x27;s inside us all; an ancient spirit that&#x27;s passionate and dark and survives.&quot; Her friend Gabriela then suggested &quot;&quot;, a medical term for &quot;marrow&quot; in Latin. She noted that the word refers not only to bone marrow, but also to various other anatomical structures, including parts of the kidney and of hair; in this sense, she said the word represented &quot;getting to the essence of something&quot;. The accent on the letter &quot;ú&quot; was intended to make the word cuter with a pun on the Icelandic word &quot;&quot;: &quot;We thought it was funny,&quot; she said, &quot;then it became mysterious.&quot;

==Composition==
===Style and influences===
At the time of its construction, Björk considered &quot;Medúlla&quot; to be her most political album, saying that it countered outbreaks of racism and patriotism that followed the 11 September attacks. &quot;On 9/11, in the space of a half an hour, this became the most patriotic place on earth&quot;, she recalled. &quot;I remember describing to my friends on my phone that [if] I turned 180 degrees anywhere I was in New York. I would count at least 37 American flags. So it was kind of scary for a foreigner to be here&quot;. Regarding the album&#x27;s composition, Björk also mentioned that she tried to find the common soul in everything, outside nationality and religion, whilst elaborating that she felt that &quot;in that sense, it&#x27;s a greatest hits of human spiritualism [&quot;laughs&quot;]. I think it&#x27;s the first time I have done an album while I am reading the news. These are crazy times. It just seems that patriotism is a bad idea. I don&#x27;t know how directly the album reflects that, but it is sort of anti-patriotic. Anti-Iceland as much as anti-anything&quot;.

&quot;Medúlla&quot; is almost entirely a cappella, also demonstrating avant-garde and experimental music. musicOMH&#x27;s review stated that, &quot;Despite its voice-only premise, &quot;Medúlla&quot; shows off a mile-wide scope of influences&quot;, noting elements of folk and medieval music, despite Björk previously stating that &quot;Medúlla&quot; was &quot;folk music, but without any folk attached&quot; to the album. She also considered the styles encompassing the album as &quot;primitive and silly&quot;. &quot;Wondering Sound&quot; wrote that despite &quot;its comparative starkness, [&quot;Medúlla&quot; is] every bit as sensual as [&quot;Vespertine&quot;]&quot;. The publication also added: &quot;The electronic treatments range from industrial distortion to percussive glitches and dreamy layering, rarely descending into novelty&quot;. The album combines beatboxing, classical choirs that suggest composers like Penderecki or Arvo Pärt, and &quot;mews, moans, counterpoint and guttural grunts&quot; provided by herself and guests like Mike Patton, Robert Wyatt and Tanya Tagaq. &quot;Medúlla&quot; includes &quot;vocal fantasias&quot; that lean toward chamber music, alongside tracks that &quot;are obviously but distantly connected to hip-hop.&quot; Glimpses of Bulgarian women&#x27;s choirs, the polyphony of central African pygmies, and the &quot;primal vocalisms&quot; of Meredith Monk were also noted.

===Songs===
The album opens with &quot;Pleasure Is All Mine&quot;, which begins with a vocal harmony layered on top of a woman&#x27;s panting for a short while prior to when Björk starts singing her verses. The verses additionally have the background filled by a harmonic and cathedral-mimicking choir. Björk sings &quot;When in doubt: give&quot; repeatedly, yielding contrast to an &quot;alarming&quot; groove. &quot;Show Me Forgiveness&quot;, an a cappella &quot;short confessional anthem&quot; follows, having no other effect than a subtle echo exerted onto her voice. She sings: &quot;Show me forgiveness / For having lost faith in myself / And let my own interior up / To inferior forces / The shame is endless&quot;. During the third song &quot;Where Is the Line&quot;, she lyrically attacks a younger relative for being greedy and unreliable, displaying vexation: &quot;I&#x27;m elastic for you, but enough is enough&quot;. &quot;Demonic vocals&quot; are delivered by singer Mike Patton, and &quot;angelically dissonant swaths of lush singing&quot; from the Icelandic Choir; as Rahzel beatboxes, the choir emotes some &quot;ahhhs&quot;. The song grows darker as it builds up as the male members of the choir deliver heavier sounds. The &quot;somber&quot; song called &quot;Vökuró&quot;, originally by Jórunn Viðar, is the fourth track on &quot;Medúlla&quot;. The song is in Icelandic; Björk rolls her tongue around certain words, accompanied by a choir.
During the fifth track &quot;Öll Birtan&quot;, Björk&#x27;s voice is layered over several times, with a voice resembling a drone in the left channel, whilst &quot;doot-doos&quot; echo into the right side of the audio. The following song and lead single &quot;Who Is It&quot; features collaborations by Inuit throat singer Tanya Tagaq and Rahzel. Some lyrics of the song—&quot;Who is it that never lets you down?&quot;—may be understood to reflect a &quot;mother&#x27;s unconditional love&quot; in a dialogue between mother and child. The echo effects in &quot;Who Is It&quot; may additionally reflect the scattered sense of self the mother may experience as she carries the burden of constant care for her child. &quot;Submarine&quot;, the seventh track on the album, was influenced by Björk&#x27;s pregnancy with her daughter Ísadóra and how she felt somewhat lazy during that time. It has a &quot;hint of political consciousness&quot;, and features the &quot;reedy&quot; voice of singer Robert Wyatt multiplied into a chorus to share lines like &quot;Shake us out of the heavy deep sleep, do it now&quot;. The next track &quot;Desired Constellation&quot; was created from a sample of Björk singing the phrase &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it&quot; from &quot;Hidden Place&quot; on her previous album, &quot;Vespertine&quot;. She imagines herself &quot;With a palm full of stars/ I throw them like dice on the table/ Until the desired constellation appears&quot;.

The ninth song, &quot;Oceania&quot;, is about &quot;Mother Oceania&quot;, from whom Björk believes all life materialised, whilst she sings: &quot;You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore&quot;. &quot;Oceania&quot; also features The London Choir. Tenth song &quot;Sonnets/Unrealities XI&quot; was based on the poem &quot;It May Not Always Be So; And I Say&quot; by E. E. Cummings, and features only Björk&#x27;s singing, with small inflections from the Icelandic Choir while she bids farewell to a lover lyrically. The following track &quot;Ancestors&quot; has no lyrics, featuring only Björk and Tagaq&#x27;s voices. The twelfth song &quot;Mouth&#x27;s Cradle&quot; is paced by a &quot;glug, glug&quot; sample of &quot;what might as well be the emptying of a gallon bottle of water&quot;. Lyrically, she concludes: &quot;I need a shelter to build an altar away from Osamas and Bushes&quot;. On the thirteenth track of the album, &quot;Miðvikudags&quot;, Björk sings once again in gibberish, while some &quot;doot-doos&quot; can be heard in the background, reminiscent of &quot;Öll Birtan&quot;. On the closing track and second single, &quot;Triumph of a Heart&quot;, the singer lyrically &quot;celebrates the workings of anatomy&quot;, whilst musically it is the album&#x27;s closest thing to a dance track. The song also features orchestral arrangements by the Icelandic and London Choirs, as well as hooks coming from a &quot;human trombone&quot;, herself, Gregory Purnhagen, and Rahzel and Dokaka.

==Release and promotion==
On 3 August 2004, BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;The Breezeblock&quot; show premiered the tracks &quot;Pleasure Is All Mine&quot; and &quot;Mouth&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, whilst &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper has posted on their website short clips for four tracks &quot;Mouth&#x27;s Cradle&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot;, &quot;Where Is the Line&quot; and &quot;Who Is It&quot;. &quot;Medúlla&quot; was first released on 30 August 2004 worldwide through Polydor Records, whilst it was distributed in the United Kingdom by One Little Indian. In the United States, the album was released the day after, by Elektra Records. Lead single &quot;Who Is It&quot; reached the top five in Spain, also peaking within the top 30 in Italy and the United Kingdom. Second single &quot;Triumph of a Heart&quot; peaked at the top ten in Spain, and reached the top 40 in Italy and the United Kingdom.

&quot;Oceania&quot; was commissioned by the International Olympic Committee and performed at the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. She wore a very large dress which unfolded during her performance to eventually occupy the entire stadium and showed a map of the world in sign of union. On 8 October 2004, Björk performed at the BBC Studios for the show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. She performed a bell choir mix of &quot;Who Is It&quot; with Rahzel and an English bell choir. On 10 October 2004, Björk performed a set of five songs live in studio for Gilles Peterson&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 program. On 25 October 2004, Björk performed a set of six songs for the French television show &quot;Album de la Semaine&quot; at Canal+ studios in Paris, France.

Other than these few performances, no concerts or tours were arranged to promote &quot;Medúlla&quot;. Björk said in an interview that &quot;everybody involved seems to be up for it, so maybe they&#x27;ll all come on the road. What I&#x27;d like to do is make another album like this and then tour for two of them at once&quot;. She also spoke to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in June 2004 and told that she wished to immediately continue writing and recording yet another new album: &quot;Every album I&#x27;ve done, the minute that it&#x27;s done, I feel really lubricated and, like, &#x27;Wow, now I can write an album in five minutes&#x27;... And I just want to find out if that&#x27;s just a fantasy or if it&#x27;s true.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Medúlla&quot; received acclaim from music critics. The album holds a rating of 84 out of 100 at Metacritic. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s David Peschek gave it five stars out of five and heralded it as &quot;brave and unique&quot;. Dominique Leone from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; commented that &quot;Medúlla&quot; was &quot;an interesting record&quot;, while saying Björk had &quot;found a way to bathe her immediately distinctive melodies and vocal nuances in solutions that cause me to reevaluate her voice and her craft&quot;. Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that &quot;Medúlla&quot; was simultaneously Björk&#x27;s &quot;most extreme&quot; record and &quot;the most immediately accessible&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot;″s Ann Powers was also positive, calling it &quot;another playful step&quot; in Björk&#x27;s &quot;unstoppable, wandering quest&quot;. Matthew Gasteier from &quot;Prefix&quot; magazine called &quot;Medúlla&quot; her most exuberant album since &quot;Post&quot;, as well as her oddest at the time. Mark Daniell from Canadian website Jam! also gave it a positive review, saying &quot;pairing gooey purrs with grooves provided by a human trombone might not seem like a good idea, but when Björk is the one making the arrangements the effect is spine tingling&quot;. Andy Battaglia of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said that &quot;once perceptions and expectations settle out... the album proves arrestingly in thrall to its own twisted tongue&quot;.

Heather Phares of AllMusic thought that &quot;Medúlla&quot; was &quot;not an immediate album, but it is a fascinating one, especially for anyone interested in the world&#x27;s oldest instrument being used in unexpected ways&quot;. Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News called the album &quot;an ambitious project&quot;, but not because it was almost entirely a cappella. She said that some songs are &quot;pretty unusual&quot;, as some could be medieval hymns, and others could be modern pop songs. E! Online commented that &quot;fans of the Icelandic wonder&#x27;s more orchestral tunes might think there&#x27;s something missing here. Well, unless they&#x27;re too busy being totally blown away&quot;. David Hooper from BBC Music gave &quot;Medúlla&quot; a mixed review, praising its high points and lack of dullness, but feeling that the album left him &quot;rather confused&quot; due to what he found to be excessive experimentation, thus remarking that the album was &quot;disjointed&quot; and &quot;claustrophobic&quot;. Björk received two Grammy Award nominations for &quot;Medúlla&quot;, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Oceania&quot;, and Best Alternative Music Album. The album was also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>A drinking straw is a utensil that uses suction to carry the contents of a beverage to one&#x27;s mouth. A straw is used by placing one end in the mouth and the other in a beverage. By applying suction with the mouth, the air pressure in the mouth drops, which causes atmospheric pressure to force the liquid through the straw and into the mouth. Drinking straws can be straight or have an angle-adjustable bellows segment.

Disposable straws are commonly made from plastics. However, environmental concerns related to plastic pollution and new regulation have led to rise in reusable and biodegradable straws. Following a rise in regulation and public concern, some companies have voluntarily banned or reduced the number of plastic straws used. Alternative straws are often made of reusable materials like silicone or metal or alternative disposable and biodegradable materials like paper, cardboard, pasta, or bamboo.

Straws have been used since earliest recorded history, with the first extant straws dating from the 4th century BCE. Different traditional drinks and foods use straws designed for explicit purposes, such as the &quot;straw and sieve&quot; bombilla used to drink the mate infusion common to South America. Since the early 20th century, mass-production of straws from plastic and other industrial products such as cellophane has increased the widespread availability of disposable straws.

Though most straws are used by able-bodied peoples, they play an important role in food and drink access for people with physical disabilities that affect their ability to swallow, hold glassware, or carry the weight of drinks or other liquids. Straws can also be an important part of both child and elderly care or in recovery from certain medical procedures such as dental work, making it safer and easier to consume liquids. However, the use of straws may not always be advisable depending on the health situation.

==History==
=== Early examples ===
The first known straws were made by the Sumerians and were used for drinking beer, probably to avoid the solid byproducts of fermentation that sink to the bottom. The oldest drinking straw in existence, found in a Sumerian tomb dated 3,000 BCE, was a gold tube inlaid with the precious blue stone lapis lazuli. Others claim metal ‘sceptres’ discovered in Armenia in 1897 and date to the Maykop culture (3700 to 2900 BCE) as the oldest surviving straws.

In the 1800s, the rye straw came into fashion because it was cheap and soft, but it had an unfortunate tendency to turn to mush when put in liquid.

American Marvin C. Stone patented the modern drinking straw, inches long and made of paper, in 1888, to address the shortcomings of the rye straw. He came upon the idea while drinking a mint julep on a hot day in Washington, D.C.; the taste of the rye straw was mixing with the drink and giving it a grassy taste, which he found unsatisfactory. He wound paper around a pencil to make a thin tube, slid out the pencil from one end, and applied glue between the strips. He later refined it by building a machine that would coat the outside of the paper with wax to hold it together, so the glue would not dissolve in bourbon.

According to a 1925 bulletin from the National Geographic Society, the people of Jubaland (modern-day Somalia) used hollow &quot;drinking sticks&quot;, two feet long and half an inch in diameter, to drink from the yak tree.

Early paper straws had a narrow bore, to prevent seeds from clogging them. It was common to use two of them, to reduce the effort needed to take each sip.

=== Mass production ===
Plastic straws became widespread following World War II. The materials used in their manufacture were inexpensive, and the types of restaurant fare that they accompanied had become more affordable and popular.

In 1930, Otto W. Dieffenbach Sr. developed and produced a cellophane drinking straw in Baltimore. His company known as Glassips Inc., produced straws for restaurants and other products. One patent dates to 1954. Dieffenbach served as chairman until 1972 and the business, then based in Towson, Maryland, was sold in 1979.

One of the first mass-produced twisted straw was Sip-N-See invented by Milton Dinhofer. Dinhofer originally patented his straw in the shape of a scissor with two loops on top, but Macy&#x27;s would not carry the straw unless it had a character on it. They suggested Dinhofer make three straws (eventually patented in 1950): a cowboy, a clown and an animal for which he made an elephant. Each of his characters was attached to a looping soft polyethylene straw. Rexor Corp. copyrighted the straw the same year, but Macy&#x27;s decided not to carry them. Dinhofer first marketed the straws with Woolworths. The straws were sold in individual boxes, and more characters were eventually added. Other buyers began to carry it, too, and it was marketed as an &quot;action drinking toy.&quot; Sip-N-See went on to sell approximately six million units.

==Types==
Drinking straws come in many variations and are manufactured using a variety of materials.

=== Plastic ===
The most common form of drinking straw is made of the thermoplastic polymer polypropylene. This plastic is known for its durability, lightness, and ability to be manufactured at a low cost. Other plastic polymers that exhibit these traits include polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).

These attributes are what have made the traditional plastic straw ubiquitous in fast food establishments and take-out orders around the world. Additionally, other advantages of plastic straws include their ability to be molded into different shapes and sizes while also being able to withstand a wide range of temperatures without deforming. This is important because straws must be temperature resistant and thermally insulated because they can be used in both hot and cold beverages.
One interesting variation of the plastic straw is the &quot;bendy straw&quot;, commonly referred to in the industry as an &quot;articulated straw&quot;. This straw has a concertina-type hinge near its top to allow for improved maneuverability of the straw when drinking a beverage, especially from a low angle. The articulated straw was invented by Joseph Friedman in 1937. He quickly developed the straw after he saw his daughter struggling to use a normal straight straw.
Another variation of the plastic straw, the &quot;spoon straw&quot;, has a spoon-like tip at the bottom, and is often used with iced slush beverages.

&quot;Stir straws&quot; with a relatively short length and quite a narrow bore are often given along with disposable cups for preparing coffee or tea and serve the primary function of being able to stir in sugar, sweetener, cream, or non-dairy creamer, as well as allowing for sipping a hot beverage. Additionally, boba tea plastic straws with wider openings are commonly used to drink bubble tea, to better accommodate its characteristic tapioca pearls. The tip of these straws is often cut at an angle creating a point which allows one to use the straw to puncture the plastic cover of bubble tea drinks.

Plastic straws can also be embellished with some forms marketed as &quot;crazy straws&quot;, having a number of twists and turns at the top. These straws are often marketed and can be entertaining for young children. The crazy straw was invented by Arthur Philip Gildersleeve and patented in 1936.

=== Reusable ===
Environmental concerns, stemming from the impact plastic waste has had on the ocean, have led to a rise in reusable straws. Reusable straws are primarily being manufactured out of polylactic acid (PLA), silicone, and metal. Polylactic acid and silicone straws are the most similar in texture and feel to their plastic counterparts, however, they fit into the category of biodegradable polymers. These types of straws have some benefits over other more ecologically conscious straws because they are resistant to disintegrating in one&#x27;s drink and provide adequate insulation for hot and cold drinks. One manufacturer of silicone straws even claims that their straws can be burned into biodegradable ash.

Metal and glass straws are other reusable alternatives. A &quot;vampire straw&quot; is a large metal drinking straw with a pointed tip that allows it to double as a dagger-like weapon. A man was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport after a vampire straw was confiscated from his carry-on luggage.

==== Bombilla ====
=== Single-use ===
Some companies such as Starbucks have moved away from plastic straws. Bamboo straws are sometimes made from the moso bamboo tree (&quot;Phyllostachys edulis&quot;).

Some companies such as McDonald&#x27;s have switched to paper and paperboard straws. 

=== Edible ===
Edible straws have been made out of materials like rice, seaweed, rye, and confectioneries (such as candy).

Flavor straws are a form of drinking straw with a flavoring included, designed to make drinking milk more pleasant for children. They first marketed in the United States in 1956 as Flav-R-Straws. Newer variations of the original idea have been resurrected in forms such as Sipahhs, and Magic Milk Straws that contain hundreds of flavored pellets encased within a stiff plastic straw.

==Environmental impact==

Plastic straws are not widely recycled and, when improperly disposed, contribute to pollution of the environment.

A video of a plastic straw being removed from the nostril of a sea turtle by marine biologist Nathan J. Robinson, filmed by Christine Figgener, quickly spread across all forms of media and spurred the elevation of awareness regarding the potential danger of plastic straws for marine life. The scientist who uploaded the video remarks that it is the emotional pull of the imagery, rather than the significance of the plastic straw itself, that garnered such high viewership.

=== Quantity ===
One anti-straw advocacy group has estimated that about 500 million straws are used daily in the United States alone—an average 1.6 straws per capita per day. This statistic has been criticized as inaccurate, because it was approximated by Milo Cress, who was nine years old at the time, after surveying straw manufacturers to ask their estimates of the total, which he then averaged. (Further details are unavailable as &quot;being 9, he had not thought to document the process closely.&quot;) This figure has been widely cited by major news organizations. Market research firm Freedonia Group estimated the number to be 390 million. Another market research firm Technomic estimated the number to be 170 million, although this number excludes some types of straws.

In ocean trash, straws and stirrers are high in number but low in weight. They were the 9th most commonly collected item in the Ocean Conservancy&#x27;s 2023 International Coastal Cleanup, with 415,957 collected. With an estimated 437 million to 8.3 billion remaining to be collected worldwide in 2018, by weight, they are less than 0.022% of plastic waste emitted to oceans.

=== Microplastics ===
Microplastics pollution is a concern if plastic waste is improperly dumped. If plastic straws are improperly disposed of, they can be transported via water into soil ecosystems, and others, where they break down into smaller, more hazardous pieces than the original plastic straw.

Water can break down plastic waste into microplastic and nanoplastic particles. These particles are capable of transmitting harmful substances or can themselves prove dangerous, as they have been shown to negatively affect the surrounding environment.

=== Alternatives ===

Some environmentalists say that straws are simply unnecessary in most cases, except for people with certain medical issues and certain beverages like bubble tea.

Alternatives to plastic straws, some reusable, exist, although they are not always readily available, or deemed to be of sufficient quality for all users (including, in particular, those with a disability). Paper straws have proliferated as a popular alternative, although they are prone to losing their rigidity when soaked inside a beverage, and in some cases are not durable enough for thicker beverages such as milkshakes. Metal straws are more durable, but they are incapable of being bent, can damage teeth or lacerate children or kill adults during falls, and some restaurants have reported them as a target of theft.

Some critics have argued that paper and metal alternatives are no more environmentally-friendly than plastic, citing the environmental impacts of paper and mining, and that paper straws would likely end up in landfills and not be composted. In August 2019, after deploying paper straws in the United Kingdom, McDonald&#x27;s stated that its straws could not actually be recycled at present, since their thickness &quot;makes it difficult for them to be processed by our waste solution providers&quot;. The chain stated that they went towards energy production, and not to landfills.

Polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable plastic, requires 69% fewer fossil fuel resources to produce than plastic, but it requires very specific conditions to break down fully. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), derived from plant oil, is marine biodegradable. In 2021, the manufacturing company Wincup was distributing a PHA product branded as &quot;the Phade straw.&quot;

As of 2021 several eco-friendly alternative materials have been tried. Among them are hay straws, bamboo straws, seaweed straws, and straws made from naturally dried fallen coconut leaves.

=== Greenwashing ===
In an attempt to artificially boost sales, some groups have been guilty of &quot;greenwashing&quot;, or falsely marketing their products as a viable environmentally friendly alternative, when it is actually just as harmful to the environment, or worse. These marketing tactics draw in well-meaning consumers who believe they are helping the environment (often by paying more for a product), when they are instead encouraging these misleading strategies.

To combat this scheme, TerraChoice, an America-based advertising company, crafted a rubric to calculate the amount of greenwashing prevalent in a product. They determined that 95% of products they surveyed at American and Canadian stores are guilty of at least one act of greenwashing.

==Plastic straw bans and proposals==
In the late 2010s, a movement towards laws banning or otherwise restricting the use of plastic straws and other single-use plastics emerged. Environmental groups have encouraged consumers to object to &quot;forced&quot; inclusion of plastic straws with food service. The movement followed the discovery of plastic particles in oceanic garbage patches and larger plastic waste-reduction efforts that focused on banning plastic bags in some jurisdictions. It has been intensified by viral videos, including one of a plastic straw being removed from a sea turtle&#x27;s nostril by biologist Nathan J. Robinson and filmed by marine biologist and activist Christine Figgener.

===By country===
====Australia====
A single-use plastic ban was introduced in the state of South Australia in 2020. Fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s promised to phase out plastic straws throughout Australia by 2020.

====Brazil====
On 5 July 2018, the city of Rio de Janeiro became the first state capital of Brazil to forbid the distribution of plastic straws, &quot;forcing restaurants, coffee shops, bars and the like, beach huts and hawkers of the municipality to use and provide to its customers only biodegradable and/or recyclable paper straws individually&quot;.

====Canada====
In May 2018, the Vancouver city council voted in favor of adopting a &quot;Single Use Reduction Strategy&quot;, targeting single-use styrofoam containers and plastic straws. The council approved the first phase of the regulations in November 2019, expected to be in place by April 2020, barring the distribution of single-use straws unless requested (with straws on hand required to be bendable for accessibility reasons). Bubble tea shops will be given a one-year exemption.

In March 2019, Starbucks announced that they would be debuting strawless lids for cold drinks across Toronto as a part of their global environmental aspirations.

In June 2019, in the lead-up to the federal election, prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his intent to enact legislation restricting the use of petroleum-based single-used plastics as early as 2021. In 2023, the ban was overturned by the Federal Court, as it was found to be &quot;unreasonable and unconstitutional&quot;.

====European Union====
In May 2018, the European Union proposed a directive banning a number of single-use plastic items including straws, cotton buds, cutlery, balloon sticks and drink stirrers, in addition to limiting the use other single-use plastics and extending producer responsibility. The EU estimated the plan would avoid 3.4 million tons of carbon emissions, save consumers €6.5 billion, and prevent environmental damage that would cost the equivalent of €22 billion by the year 2030. In October 2018, the European Parliament voted to pass the directive with 571 votes for and 53 votes against, and the directive came into effect on 2 July 2021. The specificity of the European market is that it prohibits all types of straws made of plastic, whether bio-based or compostable. This means that popular straws made of PHA, PBS or PLA for example, are prohibited in this territory.

==== New Zealand ====
Plastic straws and other single-use plastics were banned in New Zealand on 1 July 2023, with exceptions for disabled people. Plastic straws that are addded to packaging by machines (such as juice boxes) will be banned on 1 January 2026.

====Taiwan====
Single-use plastic straws banned in government facilities, schools, department stores, shopping malls and fast food restaurants from 1 July 2019.

====United Kingdom====
The UK government committed at most £4 million to &quot;Plastics innovation: towards zero waste&quot; in the summer of 2017 in an attempt to mitigate the circulation of unnecessary plastic. In this endeavor, eleven projects secured the full amount in government support. These projects each invented new ways to recycle used plastic products and prevent them from reaching landfills. In 2018, Queen Elizabeth II banned all single-use plastic items from her palaces.

On 19 April 2018, ahead of Earth Day, a proposal to phase out single-use plastics was announced during the meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government. It is estimated that as of 2018, about 23 million straws are used and discarded daily in the UK. In May 2019, England announced that it would ban single-use plastic straws, stirring sticks and cotton buds in April 2020: only registered pharmacies will be allowed to sell straws to the public, and restaurants may only offer them by request of customers. The ban was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic and came into effect on 1 October 2020.

====United States==== 
On February 10, 2025 President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at encouraging the U.S. government and consumers to buy plastic drinking straws, pushing back efforts by President Biden to phase them out.
=====California=====
On 7 November 2017, the city of Santa Cruz, California, implemented a ban on all non-recyclable to-go containers, straws, and lids but allowed for 6 months for all businesses to come into compliance before enforcement would occur. On 1 January 2018, the city of Alameda, California, citing the Santa Cruz effort, implemented an immediate ban on all straws, except if requested by a customer, and gave business until 1 July 2018, when it would be required that all straws to be of compostable paper and that all other to-go containers be recyclable.

A statewide California law restricting the providing of single-use plastic straws went into effect on 1 January 2019. Under the law, restaurants are only allowed to provide single-use plastic straws upon request. The law applies to sit-down restaurants but exempts fast-food restaurants, delis, coffee shops, and restaurants that do takeout only. The law does not apply to-go cups and takeaway drinks. A restaurant will receive warnings for its first two violations, then a $25 per day fine for each subsequent violation, up to a maximum of $300 in a year. In a statement released upon his signing the legislation into law, then-Governor Jerry Brown said &quot;It is a very small step to make a customer who wants a plastic straw ask for it. And it might make them pause and think again about an alternative. But one thing is clear, we must find ways to reduce and eventually eliminate single-use plastic products.&quot;

Local regulations have also been passed in Malibu, Davis and San Luis Obispo, California.

=====Florida=====
Local regulations have been passed in Miami Beach and Fort Myers, Florida.

=====Maryland=====
A ban on single-use straws has been instituted in Montgomery County, Maryland, going into full effect on 21 December 2021.

===== Massachusetts =====
In 2015, Williamstown, Massachusetts, banned straws that are not recyclable or compostable as part of its Article 42 polystyrene regulations.

In the first half of 2018, three towns in Massachusetts banned petrochemical plastic straws directly in the case of Provincetown, and as part of broader sustainable food packaging laws in Andover and Brookline.

In 2019, Longmeadow, Massachusetts, banned plastic straws and polystyrene packaging.

===== New York =====
A drinking straw ban has been proposed in New York City since May 2018. Businesses are fined if a straw is provided (unless requested) and also fined if no plastic straws are available and also fined for other reasons regarding straws.

=====Washington state=====
The city of Seattle implemented a ban on non-compostable disposable straws on 1 July 2018.

===Voluntary conversions===
After consideration of a ban in the UK, in 2018, after a two-month trial of paper straws at a number of outlets in the UK, McDonald&#x27;s announced they would be switching to paper straws for all locations in the United Kingdom and Ireland. and testing the switch in U.S. locations in June 2018.

A month after the Vancouver ban passed (but before it took effect) Canada&#x27;s second-largest fast food chain, A&amp;W announced they would have plastic straws fully phased out by January 2019 in all of their locations.

Various independent restaurants have also stopped using plastic straws.

Starbucks announced conversion by 2020 to no-straw lids for all cold drinks except for frappucinos, which will be served with straws made from paper or other sustainable materials.

Hyatt Hotels announced straws would be provided by request only, starting 1 September 2018. Royal Caribbean plans to offer only paper straws on request by 2019, and IKEA said it would eliminate all single-use plastic items by 2020. Other conversions include Waitrose, London City Airport, and Burger King UK stores starting September 2018. A few other cruise lines, air lines, beverage companies, and hotels, have also made partial or complete reductions, but most companies in those industries have not, as of May 2018.

=== Opposition to bans ===
Since plastic straws account only for a tiny portion (0.022%) of plastic waste emitted in the oceans each year, some pro-environment critics have argued that plastic straw bans are insufficient to address the issue of plastic waste, and are mostly symbolic.

Full bans on single-use plastic straws have faced opposition from disability rights advocates, as they feel that alternative materials are not well-suited for use by those with impaired mobility (caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and spinal muscular atrophy). Some with neuromuscular disabilities may rely on a plastic straw for its heat resistance and due to an inability to lift a cup. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) has required public places to provide plastic straws in order to ensure that those who need them will be able to access them. In particular, not all people with disabilities may be capable of washing reusable straws, straws made from inflexible materials are not capable of being repositioned, paper straws lose their firmness over time when soaked in a beverage, and straws made from hard materials such as metal can cause injuries. Advocates have preferred laws that still allow plastic straws to be offered upon request.

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)—a U.S. conservative lobbying group against &quot;excessive&quot; regulation—has promoted model state bills which contain carve-outs for fast food and fast casual restaurants from straw bans (in effect only restricting &quot;sit-down&quot; restaurants), and restrict municipalities from preempting the rule with a stricter regulation (with the draft law text stating that the latter leads to &quot;confusing and varying regulations that could lead to unnecessary increased costs for retail and food establishments to comply with such regulations&quot;). In 2019, the re-election campaign of U.S., Republican Party president Donald Trump marketed packages of reusable plastic straws branded with Trump&#x27;s name and colored in the signature red associated with the &quot;Make America Great Again&quot; slogan, as a fundraising stunt. The campaign website promoted them as an alternative to &quot;liberal paper straws&quot;.

==In fiction==
In Miguel de Cervantes&#x27;s novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605, 1615), the narrator tells of an innkeeper who, because Don Quixote refuses to remove his makeshift helmet, fashions a drinking straw by hollowing out a reed and pours wine through it, suggesting that Don Quixote was not accustomed to this method of drinking.

Nicholson Baker&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Mezzanine&quot; (1988), includes a detailed discussion of various types of drinking straws experienced by the narrator and their relative merits.

<text>Max Stern (1904–1987) was a German-born art collector, dealer and philanthropist of Jewish heritage who fled Nazi persecution. He emigrated to London and then Canada.

In Germany, Stern owned the prestigious Galerie Stern in Düsseldorf. In 1937 he was forced by the Nazi Government to close his gallery. After many of the gallery&#x27;s work were sold at auction or confiscated by the Nazis, he fled Germany to London where he was initially interned as an enemy alien for two years before being allowed to emigrate to Canada where he established Montreal&#x27;s Dominion Gallery (in French, &quot;Galerie Dominion&quot;) and promoted young Canadian artists.

== Life before WWII ==

Max Stern was born in München-Gladbach (today&#x27;s spelling: Mönchengladbach), Germany, in April 1904. His father, Julius Stern, was a German-born Jew who worked in the textile industry, before becoming an art collector and dealer in Düsseldorf. Stern studied in Cologne, Berlin, Vienna and Paris, earning his doctorate from the University of Bonn in 1928 before entering the art business. On the death of his father, in 1934, Max became the new gallery owner.

==Nazi-era==
When the Nazis came into power in 1933, Stern was persecuted as a Jew. As anti-Jewish laws deprived him of rights, Stern prepared for exile, managing to open a gallery in London in 1935.

Under the Nazi&#x27;s, The Reich Chamber of Fine Arts withdrew professional accreditation, and Stern was given four weeks to either sell or dissolve all holdings within the Galerie Stern. His gallery was Aryanized, that is transferred to non-Jewish ownership in 1937 Stern was forced to auction off a large segment of the Stern Gallery by order of the Nazi government. These artworks were sold in Kunsthaus Lempertz. They went on the block by their lot number, Auktion 392. Not all pieces were sold, and Stern placed those that remained in storage with shipping agent Josef Roggendorf. Roggendorf held the artwork close to the Düsseldorf gallery until it was all confiscated by the National Socialist government.

Stern then spent several years trying to track down the 28 confiscated paintings. He placed an ad in the German art magazine &quot;Die Weltkunst&quot;, offering a reward for information on the paintings&#x27; locations. Recovering the paintings proved to be extremely difficult. &quot;Musical Party&quot; by Dirck Hals and &quot;Landscape with Figures&quot; by Salomon van Ruysdael were eventually recovered with help from the Canadian government after the war had ended. &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the style of Hieronymus Bosch was returned in 1954. Other works were not found.

One of the paintings from the Stern collection, Jan Wellens de Cock’s &quot;Flight into Egyp&quot;t, reappeared on June 26, 1970 in London at the Christie&#x27;s auction in London for “Highly Important Pictures from the collection formed by the late Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, the property of Heinz Kisters, Esq. and others.”

==Post-war==
Stern fled Germany in December 1937, reportedly carrying nothing but a small suitcase. He hoped to join his sister at the gallery in London but after the war began was interred by the British as an enemy alien in a refugee camp on the Isle of Man for two years. The British government then allowed him to immigrate to Canada. Stern sailed on the Polish liner &quot;Sobieski&quot;, but was unable to get his money and belongings out of Britain. He then spent two years in internment camps in New Brunswick and Quebec. He was given refugee status upon his arrival. He took steps to be exempted from this status and made contact with the man who ran the Canadian Refugee Organization, William Birks, who immediately vouched for Stern.

Because of Stern&#x27;s academic background and art dealing experience, he was named director of the Dominion Gallery of Fine Art. In January 1947, Stern and his wife became the sole proprietors of Gallery Dominion. He met his wife, a Swedish woman named Iris Westerberg, at the Canadian Refugee organization. Together, they made the gallery a focal point for the distribution of living art by Canadian artists. Both were known for promoting young and unknown Canadian art talents.

1944 was an especially important year for Stern&#x27;s promotion of Canadian art. During this year, he held separate exhibitions featuring art by four members of the Group of Seven and Emily Carr.

Stern made many important contributions towards Canadian art culture. In the 1940s he provided a means for young Canadian artists to paint on a full-time basis by establishing a contract system. In this system, monthly payments are made to the artist in exchange for an agreed number of works. This method has since been used successfully in France, England and the United States.

In 1950, Stern moved the Dominion Gallery to a three-story building in a different area of Montreal. This new building allowed for 14 exhibition rooms and an apartment on the upper level where Stern and his wife would live. Jesus Carles de Vilallonga, a catalan born artist and, later, canadian citizen, was a frequent exibitor in this gallery. Jesús Carles de Vilallonga

==Legacy and restitution claims==

Upon leaving Europe, Stern raised the level of art appreciation in Canada. He began donating to Canadian institutions in the mid-1950s and gave generously to several museums across Canada. He was especially generous to Montreal institutions, donating over 166 works.

Stern died on a business trip in Paris in 1987.

Honors he received included an honorary doctorate from Concordia University in 1985. The gallery continued to operate for more than a decade after Stern&#x27;s death, closing in December 2000. 
The Max Stern Art Restitution Project was jointly created by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, McGill University, Concordia University and the Holocaust Claims Processing Office in New York. The project&#x27;s initiative has been to locate and recover works from the original Stern collection that were lost during the 1930s. The collection held an estimated 400 pieces in total.

In 2016, the Max Stern Restitution Project recovered two Dutch Old Masters paintings – &quot;Ships in Distress on a Stormy Sea&quot; by Jan Porcellis and &quot;Landscape with Goats&quot; by Willem Buytewech the Younger.

In 2017, a scheduled exhibition in Düsseldorf about Stern and the Restitution Project was abruptly cancelled due to local opposition, leading to intense controversy.

In 2018, Düsseldorf&#x27;s Hargesheimer Auction House restituted &quot;Storm at Sea&quot;, by Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek (1778–1851) to representatives of the Max and Iris Stern Foundation and its three university beneficiaries — Concordia University and McGill University in Montreal and Hebrew University, Jerusalem. It was the 18th painting recovered on behalf of the Foundation.

In 2019 the Lempertz auction house settled a claim related to the 1937 forced sale of &quot;Happy Family in Garden&quot; by Otto Heichert (1868–1946).

<text>Cayetano Redondo Aceña (7 August 188821 May 1940) was a Spanish politician, typographer, journalist and Esperantist. A member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, he served as Mayor of Madrid from November 1936 to May 1937, during the Spanish Civil War.

== Biography ==
Born on 7 August 1888 in Segovia, he moved young to Madrid with his family. He worked as typographer. He became a member of the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT) in 1905.
In 1918, Redondo was leader of the National Federation of &quot;Juventudes Socialistas&quot;, the youth wing of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE). He worked for several political papers, including &quot;El Socialista&quot;.

In 1931, he was elected as Madrid municipal councillor at the , in representation of Chamberí. He was entrusted with the municipal government area of Social Work and with the responsibility over the district of Universidad. Later in the year, Redondo was elected on a PSOE platform as deputy to the Constituent Cortes of the Second Spanish Republic in representation of the province of Segovia at the 1931 general election.

A noted esperantist, he was the Spanish representative at the Summer School organised by the Austrian Socialist Esperantist League in 1927, and he also delivered the opening speech of the 9th Spanish Congress of Esperanto in 1932.

After the start of the Spanish Civil War, at the height of the attacks and bombings carried by the Francoist faction on Madrid, Mayor Pedro Rico fled for Valencia hidden in a car boot. Redondo was elected his replacement on 8 November, although the decisions of the Defence Council of Madrid largely determined the action of the municipal government. Redondo left the post of mayor in April 1937, replaced by Rafael Henche.

After Madrid fell, Redondo was captured by Francoist forces and executed by a firing squad at the walls of the Cementerio de la Almudena on 21 May 1940. Buried in a mass grave, his remains were later moved and buried together with those of José Gómez Osorio, the last Republican civil governor of Madrid, shot months earlier, thanks to the concern of the family of the latter. His grave is near the place chosen in memory of &quot;The Thirteen Roses.&quot;

<text>Türkmenabat (), formerly Amul, Cärjew/Chardzhou (until 1924 and from 1940-1999), and Novy Chardzhuy (from 1927-1940), is the second-largest city in Turkmenistan and the administrative centre of Lebap Province. , it had a population of approximately 231,000 people (up from 161,000 in the 1989 census). From 1924 to 1927, it was also named Leninsk in honor of Vladimir Lenin.

== Etymology ==
The former name of the city, Çärjew (also Chardzhou), is a Turkmen borrowing from the Persian &quot;čahârjuy&quot;, which consists of two parts: &quot;čahâr&quot;, meaning &quot;four&quot;, and &quot;juy&quot;, meaning &quot;brook&quot;. This type of naming is also common in Iran, such as the village Se Juy (literally &#x27;three brooks&#x27;). The current name of the city is simply a combining of &quot;Türkmen&quot; and the Persian suffix &quot;ābād (آباد)&quot;, meaning &quot;cultivated place&quot; (village, city, region).

==Geography==
Türkmenabat is located at an altitude of on the banks of the Amu Darya River, near the border with Uzbekistan. Türkmenabat is at the center of Lebap province, which has borders with three provinces in Turkmenistan: Mary, Ahal and Daşoguz. The province also borders Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.

Some south of Türkmenabat in the East Karakum Desert is the Repetek Nature Reserve, famed for its &quot;zemzen&quot;, or desert crocodiles.

==History==
A modern industrial city, Türkmenabat&#x27;s history spans 2,000 years. In ancient times, it was known as Āmul (to be distinguished from the Iranian city of Amol). The river Amu Darya is said to mean &quot;River of Āmul&quot;, named after this ancient city. Türkmenabat was the hub in an intersection of three routes of the Great Silk Road leading to Bukhara, Khiva and Merv. . For centuries, Āmul was an important town of the Uzbek feudal khanate (later emirate) of Bukhara.

When the Russian Empire began annexing Central Asian Turkestan, Āmul was surrendered to Russians by the Bukhara emirate, which subsequently became a vassal of Russia and pledged allegiance to the Russian emperor. The modern city was founded in 1886, when Russian Cossacks settled in Uralka in what is now the eastern part of Türkmenabat, naming their settlement &quot;New-Chardjuy&quot;. Settlement here was necessary to complete construction of the Trans-Caspian railway.

After the revolution of 1917, during which the Bolsheviks came into power in Russia, communists merged the former Central Asian oblasts of the Russian Empire along with the former Khanates of Khiva (Khorezm) and Bukhara into republics on the basis of nationality. In 1924, Türkmenabat (known as &quot;Chardjuy&quot; at that time) city&#x27;s sedentary and urban population was Uzbek. But at the time, as Turkmens were a largely nomadic nation, and Soviet economic and industrialization plans for the proposed Turkmen SSR required a relatively large anchor city; thus the city was passed to the newly created Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic.

Its role as a railway junction, and the high fertility of the Amu Darya region, made it the major trade center for agricultural products in the northeast region of the country. The city features food processing, textile (cotton processing and silk) factories. Çärjew was Turkmenistan&#x27;s industrial and transport hub during the Soviet period, but most of these related jobs and transport opportunities have been relocated to Ashgabat or closed since Turkmenistan&#x27;s independence.

From the article about Chardjuy in the &quot;Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary&quot; (beginning of the 20th century):
Chardjuy is an urban settlement formed near the Amu-Darya station (1070 c. from Krasnovodsk) of the Central Asian Railway, on the left bank of the Amu-Darya River, on land ceded by the emir of Bukhara to the Russian government. There are 4 068 inhabitants (2 651 men, 1 417 women), including 3 501 Russians. There are wide straight streets, enough greenery, many shops, and a rather lively bazaar. Chardjuy is an important trade center, where goods going to Bukhara, Khiva, and partly to Afghanistan, are loaded onto river vessels. The steamboat of the Amu Darya fleet maintains communication between Patta Gissar (Termez) in the south and Petro-Aleksandrovsky (Khiva)... At 16 verst from Chardjuy lies the rather large Bukharan city of Chardjuy (native Chardjuy), the center of Chardjuy province (bekstvo), with the remains of walls and a fortress; 15 thousand inhabitants. Old Chardjuy (Amu-Darya) is characterized by a lively trade exchange. In 1900, 1820244 pd arrived at the station. (military supplies, sugar, timber, building material, iron, flour, tea, rice, etc.); Sent from the Chardjuy station in the same year: 963382 (leather, carpets, sheepskin, cotton seed, cotton - 516641 pd, wool, etc.).

The third edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia wrote of the city:Chardzhou, city, center of Chardzhou oblast of Turkmen SSR, pier on the left bank of the Amu Darya (where the Krasnovodsk-Tashkent railroad line crosses). From Chardzhou the Kungrad-Makat rail line begins. 113,000 residents in 1977 (51,000 in 1939). It arose in the 1880s as a Russian fortification on the territory of the Khanate of Bukhara. From 1886 the city, named New Chardzou, was a commercial and transportation hub of Central Asia (in 1888 the Central Asian Railway came through Chardzhou). From 1918-24 it was part of the Turkestan ASSR; from 1924, the Turkmen SSR. From 1937, it was named Chardzhou. From 1939-63 and since 1970, it was an oblast center.

<doc id="967388" wikidata="Q381984" url="?curid=967388" title="Thomas P. M. Barnett">
<text>Thomas P. M. Barnett (born 1962) is an American military geostrategist and former chief analyst at Wikistrat. He developed a geopolitical theory that divided the world into &quot;the Functioning Core&quot; and the &quot;Non-Integrating Gap&quot; that made him particularly notable prior to the 2003 U.S. Invasion of Iraq when he wrote an article for &quot;Esquire&quot; in support of the military action entitled &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s New Map&quot; (which would later become the title of a book that would elaborate on his geopolitical theories). The central thesis of his geopolitical theory is that the connections the globalization brings between countries (including network connectivity, financial transactions, and media flows) are synonymous with those countries with stable governments, rising standards of living, and &quot;more deaths by suicide than by murder&quot;. These regions contrast with those where globalization has not yet penetrated, which is synonymous with political repression, poverty, disease, and mass-murder, and conflict. These areas make up the Non-Integrating Gap.

Key to Barnett&#x27;s geostrategic ideas is that the United States should &quot;export security&quot; to the Gap in order to integrate and connect those regions with the Core, even if this means going to war in Gap countries, followed by long periods of nation-building.

==Education and career==
Barnett was born in Chilton, Wisconsin and grew up in Boscobel, Wisconsin. After graduation from Boscobel High School, Barnett received a B.A. (Honors) from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in Russian language and literature, and international relations with an emphasis in U.S. foreign policy. He received his MA in regional studies: Russia, Eastern Europe and Central Asia and his PhD in political science from Harvard University.

From 1998 through 2004, Barnett was a senior strategic researcher and professor in the Warfare Analysis &amp; Research Department, Center for Naval Warfare Studies, U.S. Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island.

At the Naval War College, Barnett served as director of the New Rule Sets Project an effort designed to explore how the spread of globalization alters the basic &quot;rules of the road&quot; in the international security environment, with special reference to how these changes redefine the U.S. military&#x27;s historic role as &quot;security enabler&quot; of America&#x27;s commercial network ties with the world. The project was hosted by Cantor Fitzgerald and took place near the top of One World Trade Center. After the offices of Cantor Fitzgerald and its carbon credit brokerage subsidiary CantorCO2e were destroyed at One World Trade Center on 9/11/2001, Barnett described the event as the &quot;first live-broadcast, mass snuff film in human history.&quot;
Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, from October 2001 to June 2003, Barnett worked as the Assistant for Strategic Futures in the Office of Force Transformation in the Department of Defense under the direction of the late Vice Admiral (ret). Arthur K. Cebrowski, during which time he created a Powerpoint brief that developed into his book &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s New Map&quot;.

In 2003, he wrote an article titled &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s New Map&quot; for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine that outlined many of these ideas. He developed the article into a book &quot;The Pentagon&#x27;s New Map: War and Peace in the Twenty-First Century&quot;, published in 2004.

A sequel &quot;Blueprint for Action: A Future Worth Creating&quot; was published in 2005. He presented his ideas for changing America&#x27;s military structure in February 2005 in Monterey, California, for a TED talk titled &quot;Rethinking America&#x27;s military strategy&quot;.

In 2010, he became chief analyst for the Israeli start-up Wikistrat.

Barnett is currently the senior managing director of Enterra Solutions, a contributing editor for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, and a distinguished scholar and author at the Howard H. Baker, Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee. He writes the New Rules column at World Politics Review.

==Ideas and concepts==
Barnett&#x27;s ideas involve the relationship between the United States and the rest of the world in past, present, and future contexts, although much of the work revolves around defining possible future roles of the country in the aftermath of the Cold War and terrorist actions such as the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Barnett had grown up with the expectation that the United States and the Soviet Union would remain in the Cold War standoff indefinitely, and had followed an education path that would have been useful for that context. However, shortly after he completed his education and started to work in the public and private sectors, the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving America as the world&#x27;s sole superpower. He became an early advocate of collaborating with the new Russia to smooth the nation&#x27;s transition into its new role in the world. The fall of the Soviet Union was a shock to the military establishment in the U.S., leaving many to wonder what nation or group of nations would pose a significant threat in the future.

Barnett proffered that without the Soviets to defend against, the American military establishment lost focus. Some planners were concerned that the new world order was one of chaos, which is hardly something that is easy to build war games around. Many theories were bandied about, ranging from rogue state theories involving states like Iraq and North Korea, to the rise of some unexpected country to great power, or, most predominantly, the emergence of China as a new threat. Nobody could clarify which concept was most likely, right up until the September 11 attacks seemed at the time to resolve the dispute.

The NewRuleSets.Project was one of many programs that the United States military has launched since the fall of the Soviet Union in order to determine what threats will emerge in the coming decades. The project is a unique collaboration between military and financial analysts. The project name comes from the idea of &quot;rule sets,&quot; the combination of written and unwritten rules that people within a region use. It has been noted that countries that have similar rule sets tend to collaborate much more effectively than countries that have significant differences. For instance, the U.S. and Soviet Union had rule sets that were very different. Once the Soviets lost control, the country went through a &quot;rule set reset,&quot; organizing itself to more closely align with the largely democratic and capitalist societies it had once opposed.

The group also noticed that globalization has caused a fairly common rule set to be shared between a great many countries around the world. States that have benefitted from globalization and begun to share in the wealth and prosperity associated with that are also losing interest in waging war with one another. Participants in the project noticed that once the per capita income of a country increases to about US$3000 per year, war essentially disappears. There are a few places where this hasn&#x27;t exactly been the case, but it seems to largely hold true for now.

Another interesting thing to note was that, of U.S. military deployments around the world since 1990, virtually all have taken place in countries that do not meet that level of income. This leads him to unabashedly proclaim himself an economic determinist. Examining the regions more thoroughly, it was also noted that the countries have very little flow of people, information, or investment money across their borders. This all leads to the idea of these countries being &quot;disconnected&quot; from the outside world, running on rule sets that are different from that of globalized societies.

Barnett has termed the globalized countries the &quot;Functioning Core&quot; or simply &quot;the Core&quot;. The other countries are part of the &quot;Non-Integrating Gap&quot;, or simply &quot;the Gap&quot;. The Gap has been shrinking as globalization has expanded. Since most terrorists seem to come from the Gap, he believes that the American military should focus on building partnerships with &quot;seam states&quot;, countries bordering the Gap, to stabilize those regions. Stable states would bring more investment and more connectedness with the outside world, therefore progressively shrinking the Gap. The end result of all of this, if it proves to be successful, would be nothing less than the end of interstate warfare on the planet, and probably a significant reduction in intrastate warfare and other problems like terrorism.

==Esquire Magazine and the resignation of Admiral Fallon==
Barnett received notoriety in March 2008 for publishing an article in Esquire magazine on Admiral William Fallon which portrayed the Admiral at odds with the Bush administration. This led to Fallon&#x27;s resignation as the head of Central Command.

==Proposed China–US Grand Strategy Agreement==

After joining the Center for America China Partnership in 2010, Barnett and his two colleagues, John Milligan-Whyte and Dai Min, prepared the &quot;China US Grand Strategy Proposal&quot; between Presidents Hu and Obama. The agreement received input from China&#x27;s former Minister of Foreign Affairs, former UN Ambassador, former U.S. Ambassador, former Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, former Military Attaché to North Korea and Israel, former Vice Minister of Commerce, Central Party School Institute of International Strategic Studies, Chinese People&#x27;s Institute of Foreign Affairs, China Center for International Economic Exchanges, China Institute For International Strategic Studies, China Foundation for International &amp; Strategic Studies, Boao Forum, State Council’s China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, and premier and state councilors.

The agreement&#x27;s provisions were introduced in Barnett&#x27;s column in &quot;World Politics Review&quot;, and in John Milligan-Whyte and Dai Min’s columns in &quot;People’s Daily Online&quot; in English and in &quot;China Daily Online&quot; in Mandarin. The text of the agreement itself appeared in the September/October 2011 edition of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a speech about globalization, Barnett confided that after having three children, he and his wife &quot;adopted three girls from abroad – one from China and two from Ethiopia.&quot;

<doc id="967390" wikidata="Q7661937" url="?curid=967390" title="Synagogue Council of America">
<text>The Synagogue Council of America was an American Jewish organization of synagogue and rabbinical associations, founded in 1926. The Council was the umbrella body bridging the three primary religious movements within Judaism in the United States. It included:
* The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (Orthodox)
* The Rabbinical Council of America (Orthodox)
* The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (Conservative)
* The Rabbinical Assembly (Conservative)
* The Union of American Hebrew Congregations (Reform)
* The Central Conference of American Rabbis (Reform)

The organization dissolved in 1994, facing financial difficulties and fractiousness among its members, the organization effectively collapsed after a proposal to relocate the council&#x27;s offices from Manhattan to White Plains, New York, where it would have been housed in a Reform congregation, was rejected by Orthodox members of the organization. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein of the Orthodox Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun served as the organization&#x27;s final president lamented the lack of &quot;people who are really interested in maintaining the organization.&quot; Steven Bayme considers that the Council&#x27;s collapse was symbolic of the general Orthodox drift to the right, and raised serious questions of how orthodoxy can cooperate with the broader Jewish community in areas of external protection, support for Israel and Jewish continuity.

The records of the organization are stored with the American Jewish Historical Society at the Center for Jewish History (CJH) in New York, which also maintains a history of the organization.

The North American Boards of Rabbis was formed in 1999, as part of an effort at interdenominational cohesiveness in the Jewish community. The organization would be a parent body for boards of rabbis in individual communities, with its first president being Orthodox Rabbi Marc Schneier, who was then serving as president of the New York Board of Rabbis.

The Synagogue Council of America (SCA) was founded in 1926 by the congregational and rabbinical organizations of the major Jewish religious movements of American Jewry. The six bodies were and remain: The United Synagogue of America, The Rabbinical Assembly (Conservative); The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, The Rabbinical Council of America (Orthodox); The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, The Central Conference of American Rabbis (Reform). The presidents and officers, rabbis, rotated among the three movements. Later, the position of a lay chairman of the Board of Governors, appointed by the synagogal bodies, was established.

The original declaration of principles provided that the SCA seek those common concerns shared by all six constituent bodies. Thus, the SCA offered a central address for a diverse religious community that could achieve sufficient consensus to be able to speak literally with “one voice” to the larger world on vital issues. Since consensus was necessary for any action, position, and statement, the SCA did not address internal religious conflicts, often embroiling the Jewish religious community.

It is apparent that over the many decades, great care and discipline was exercised by SCA leadership to determine the agenda in a way which avoided confrontations which would lead to the casting of a veto by one constituent because of a particular ideological or theological position. Indeed, the veto was resorted to only once or twice during the SCA’s history. There was criticism of this arrangement by those who thought the purpose of the SCA was to adjudicate or at least reconcile the religious differences which were dividing the Jewish community. Not to be able to do so was viewed as “weakness” or “ineffectualness.” But that was not its mandate. This self-imposed restrictiveness accounted for the continued viability of the SCA, allowing it to develop into a full-fledged “church body” working with the other major church bodies in this country and abroad, governmental agencies in the White House.

There have been other efforts to bring individual Conservative, Orthodox and Reform Jews together to address in their collectivity internal Jewish religious issues of faith and practice. They were not able to achieve consensus on such divisive issues as conversion, inter-marriage, and women’s participation in the synagogue service.

==Closing==

The Synagogue Council of America closed its doors in 1994 after 68 years of existence due to a number of circumstances which combined to render the organization no longer viable, not least of which was the SCA’s inability to raise funds. The constituent agencies historically contributed less than 10% of its operating needs, the balance being produced each year through aggressive fundraising by the SCA itself. There was a diminution of interest in support and participation as the UOJCA, the US, and the UAHC increasingly wanted to establish their own denominational presence in interfaith exchanges and social action work with the very agencies the SCA related to in their names as well. Increasing religious divisions in Israel contributed to increased tensions among the denominations of American Jewry, making cooperation and consensus even more difficult to achieve within the Synagogue Council. The constituent bodies became increasingly driven by internal agendas, overcoming the historic commitment of each to achieve the consensus indispensable to preserving the organization and its program.

<text>Steve Berthiaume () is an American television sportscaster who serves as the play-by-play broadcast announcer for the Arizona Diamondbacks and is a former anchor on ESPN and a former sportscaster for SportsNet New York (SNY).

==Broadcasting career==
===Early career===
A graduate of Emerson College, Berthiaume&#x27;s broadcasting career began at various stations in the southern United States, including WVIR-TV in Charlottesville, Virginia; WIS-TV in Columbia, South Carolina; WJAR-TV in Providence, Rhode Island; and WEAR-TV in Pensacola, Florida. Berthiaume was hired from Pensacola by WTIC-TV in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1993; station management dismissed him in January 1996 due to what Berthiaume described as a disagreement over presentation styles. He then went on to the short-lived CNN/SI cable channel when it launched in December 1996 and to ESPN in 1999, starting at ESPNEWS and later anchoring for &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

In 2006, Berthiaume left ESPN to become chief sportscaster at SNY, a new regional sports network started by the New York Mets; however, in late January 2007, SNY let Berthiaume out of his contract to rejoin ESPN on March 28, 2007, in order to work closer to his wife. He also served as a host of &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;.

In 2012, Berthiaume was hired by MLB&#x27;s Arizona Diamondbacks to serve as a play-by-play broadcaster for Fox Sports Arizona beginning in the 2013 season, replacing Daron Sutton, whom the team had suspended. Berthiaume&#x27;s previous play-by-play experience comes from ESPN, where he had called several professional games as well as the College World Series.

<doc id="967400" wikidata="Q192863" url="?curid=967400" title="Amon Amarth">
<text>Amon Amarth () are a Swedish melodic death metal band from Tumba, formed in 1992. The band take its name from the Sindarin name of Mount Doom, a volcano in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Their lyrics mostly deal with Viking mythology and history, and so they have been sometimes erroneously labeled &quot;Viking metal&quot;, although the band prefers the term melodic death metal. 

The band is composed of lead guitarist Olavi Mikkonen, vocalist Johan Hegg, bassist Ted Lundström, rhythm guitarist Johan Söderberg, and drummer Jocke Wallgren. Amon Amarth has released 12 studio albums, one compilation album, one EP, one video album, and ten music videos. Their first studio album, &quot;Once Sent from the Golden Hall&quot;, debuted in 1998. Five more studio releases followed, before the band saw its breakthrough with the 2008 album &quot;Twilight of the Thunder God&quot;, which debuted at No. 10 on the Swedish album charts and No. 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Five more albums, &quot;Surtur Rising&quot;, &quot;Deceiver of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Jomsviking&quot;, &quot;Berserker,&quot; and &quot;The Great Heathen Army&quot;, followed in 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022 respectively.

==History==
===Formation (1988–1991)===
The band emerged from the previous grindcore (or death metal)band Scum, founded in 1988 by Paul &quot;Themgoroth&quot; Mäkitalo (Dark Funeral) on vocals, Olavi Mikkonen on lead guitar, Petri Tarvainen on bass and Vesa Meriläinen played on rhythm guitar.

===Early recordings (1992–1997)===
After a 1991 demo, Scum broke up and Amon Amarth formed in 1992. Hegg replaced Mäkitalo on vocals, Anders Hansson replaced Meriläinen on rhythm guitar and Ted Lundström replaced Tarvainen on bass, before recording its first demo &quot;Thor Arise&quot; in 1993. Raw and uneven in sound and execution, it was never officially released due to low quality standards, but the band caught the attention of extreme metal fans with its own &quot;infectious brand of epic-sounding brutality and unadorned conviction&quot;. In 1994 another demo entitled &quot;The Arrival of the Fimbul Winter&quot; was recorded; with 1,000 copies being issued.

In 1996, they signed with Pulverised Records, on which they released their first MCD, &quot;Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds&quot;, which sold 6,000 copies.

===Signed with Metal Blade (1998–2007)===

They then signed with Metal Blade Records, releasing the debut album &quot;Once Sent from the Golden Hall&quot;. Described as &quot;a compelling fusion of buzzsaw riff work, melodic harmonies and soul-crushing rhythms punctuated by Hegg&#x27;s callous black/death roar and accounts of Norse battles and treachery&quot; it made sure Amon Amarth&#x27;s popularity rose internationally. According to AllMusic, the song that bore the group&#x27;s namesake was the most memorable, containing &quot;the chaotic noises of battle, the screams of the dying, and much sword-clashing to boot.&quot; Since then they have performed at multiple Canada and US tours, festival appearances, eight music videos, and appearances in over 100 metal magazines.

In June 1998, as the band was about to commence a tour alongside Deicide, Six Feet Under and Brutal Truth, guitarist Anders Hansson left and was replaced by Johan Soderberg. After the tour Martin Lopez quit to join Opeth and Fredrik Andersson (ex-A Canorous Quintet) came in. With him in 1999 the band recorded and released their second full-length album, &quot;The Avenger.&quot; The release was supported by the X-Mas Massacre Festivals Tour with Morbid Angel headlining.

&quot;The Crusher&quot;, released in 2001, was considered to be the group&#x27;s most aggressive album. In support of it the band went on tour with Marduk and Vader, taking part in No Mercy Festival. Their first American tour, scheduled for Autumn 2001, was cancelled due to the attacks of September 11th and was held later in January 2002. In April 2002 the band toured Europe with Vomitory and in August performed at Wacken Open Air before a crowd of 12,000. &quot;Versus The World&quot; was released, alongside The Viking Edition, which contained a bonus CD with demos &quot;Thor Arise&quot; and &quot;Arrival Of The Fimbul Winter&quot;. Touring continued until Spring 2004 when the band started working on &quot;Fate of Norns,&quot; which was released on 6 September 2004. The follow-up, &quot;With Oden on Our Side&quot; was released in 2006, and showed, (according to AllMusic) that &quot;Amon Amarth continue to be champions of the worldwide death metal tournament&quot; and rose to #26 in the US Top Independent album charts. The album&#x27;s material, though, was not included in the DVD &quot;Wrath Of The Norsemen,&quot; which released in May 2006.

In early January 2008, the band&#x27;s first tour of Australia and New Zealand took place, supporting Dimmu Borgir, after finishing a US and Canadian tour with Sonic Syndicate and Himsa.

===Renewed contract with Metal Blade (2008–2014)===

Amon Amarth extended its record deal with Metal Blade Records for three more albums. After extending its record deal, the band released &quot;Twilight of the Thunder God&quot;, which featured guest appearances by Lars-Göran Petrov of Entombed, Roope Latvala of Children of Bodom, and the cello metal band Apocalyptica. Accompanying the release of the album was an eight-page comic strip based on Norse mythology which was released by magazines in Europe. The album reached #50 in the U.S., #6 in Germany, #10 in Finland, #11 in Sweden, #14 in Austria, and #21 in Switzerland. It ended up at the #7 position in Revolver Magazine&#x27;s Top 20 Albums that year.

Amon Amarth embarked on a North American headlining tour in October 2008, with support from Ensiferum, Belphegor, and The Absence. In 2009, the band returned to the U.S. for another successful series of dates with Goatwhore, Skeletonwitch and Lazarus A.D. and later in 2010 with Holy Grail and Eluveitie. In between, Amon Amarth were named &quot;Best Breakthrough Act&quot; at &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;″s prestigious Golden Gods Awards. The band also supported Slayer in its Unholy Alliance Chapter III European tour. Amon Amarth played its first show in India, headlining the Deccan Rock Festival in Bangalore on 5 December 2009.

On 30 November 2010, Amon Amarth confirmed its next album entitled &quot;Surtur Rising&quot; would be released in Spring 2011. The drums were recorded at Park Studios, while bass and guitars were recorded at Fascination Street Studios. On 27 January 2011, Metal Blade Records released the new album&#x27;s first single, titled &quot;War of the Gods&quot;, on YouTube. On 29 March 2011, &quot;Surtur Rising&quot; was released in North America. To support the album, the band embarked on a 4-month world tour with Children Of Bodom and Ensiferum, among others.

Amon Amarth performed at Wacken Open Air in 2012, Hellfest 2013, Download Festival 2013, Sweden Rock Festival, and Mayhem Festival 2013.

On 25 June 2013, Amon Amarth released its ninth studio album, &quot;Deceiver of the Gods.&quot; The album cover, according to the band, depicted Ragnarök, the last battle between the Æsir gods and Loki, accompanied by the army of the dead.

In 2014, Hegg co-founded Grimfrost, a company that produces and sells reproductions of Viking Age artefacts, as well as products inspired by Viking Age culture.

===Departure of Fredrik Andersson and &quot;Jomsviking&quot; (2015–2017)===

On 19 March 2015, Amon Amarth posted on its Facebook page that it had parted ways with drummer Fredrik Andersson after 17 years of collaboration.

The band released its 10th album, &quot;Jomsviking,&quot; on 25 March 2016. A session drummer, Tobias Gustafsson (formerly of Vomitory), was recruited for completion of the album.

From 22 to 25 March, the band performed four intimate album release shows in London, Paris, Tilburg, and Berlin to mark the release of &quot;Jomsviking&quot;. They also supported Megadeth, Suicidal Tendencies and Metal Church on the &quot;Dystopia&quot; tour in the United States in September and October 2016, and headlined a tour in the UK and Ireland with Testament as special guests.

On 30 September 2016, Amon Amarth announced Jocke Wallgren as their full-time drummer.

In an August 2017 interview at Bloodstock Open Air festival, guitarist Johan Söderberg stated that Amon Amarth would begin working on their eleventh studio album after the end of the &quot;Jomsviking&quot; tour. He is quoted as saying, &quot;After this summer, we&#x27;re done touring with this album. That&#x27;s when we&#x27;re gonna start to write stuff for the next one.&quot;

In October 2017, Johan Hegg joined the DJ roster for Gimme Radio, promoting his involvement with Amon Amarth as well as his favorite music and playlists on the show, &quot;Hammer of the North.&quot;

In November 2017, Ride &amp; Crash Games partnered with Amon Amarth to release a self-titled video game centered around the band&#x27;s songs and lyrics. It is currently available on iOS and Android.

===&quot;Berserker&quot; (2018–2022)===

On 7 January 2019, the band announced that they had finished recording their 11th studio album with producer Jay Ruston, tentatively due in the Spring. Vocalist Johan Hegg stated that he waited for the music to be completed entirely before writing any lyrics, a different approach compared to previous albums. While saying that it is not a concept album, Hegg also revealed that one of the new tracks is titled &quot;Berserker At Stamford Bridge&quot; and &quot;The Shield Wall&quot;. He stated, &quot;It&#x27;s also about sticking together in the face of adversity. Then there&#x27;s more introverted stuff, as well – songs that relate to my private life, and I got the ideas for those songs from my wife.&quot;

In May 2019, Amon Amarth embarked on a North American tour as part of Slayer&#x27;s final world tour, also featuring Lamb of God and Cannibal Corpse.

On 19 March 2019, the band released a new song, titled &quot;Raven&#x27;s Flight&quot; and revealed the name of their next album was &quot;Berserker&quot;, and will be released on 3 May 2019.

On 15 April 2019, Amon Amarth announced a headlining tour of North America to begin in September in support of &quot;Berserker&quot; alongside fellow Swedish bands Arch Enemy, At the Gates and Grand Magus.

On 17 April 2019, the band released the music video for &quot;Berserker&quot;&#x27;s second single &quot;Crack the Sky&quot;.

On 3 May 2019, the band released the album &quot;Berserker&quot;.

In Late 2019, it was announced the band would play South America with support from Powerwolf. The tour was scheduled between 28 February, beginning in Brasilia, and ending on 21 March in Bogota. However, the tour abruptly came to an end on 14 March after the Hell and Heaven Metal Fest in Mexico due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

On 28 May 2021, the band released a re-recorded version of the song &quot;Masters of War&quot; for the 20th anniversary of their third album &quot;The Crusher&quot;.

On 16 February 2022, the band released the stand-alone single &quot;Put Your Back Into the Oar&quot;.

===&quot;The Great Heathen Army&quot; (2022–present)===
Amon Amarth announced in June 2022 that their 12th full-length album was titled &quot;The Great Heathen Army&quot;. It is their first album that features the band themselves on the album cover since their debut album. Paired with the announcement of the album was a release of a music video for &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; featuring Erick Redbeard, a wrestler for AEW. The album was released on 5 August 2022.

Amon Amarth toured with Machine Head for the Vikings and Lionhearts Tour 2022, a concert tour of Europe taking place in September and October 2022.

Amon Amarth headlined 2022 the Great Heathen Tour of North America in November and December 2022, with support from Carcass, Obituary, and Cattle Decapitation.

==Musical style and lyrics==
Under their original name Scum, the band played grindcore. However, in 1992 the band changed their name to Amon Amarth and adopted a more death metal-orientated style. The band is now usually considered melodic death metal.

The band bases most of its song lyrics on Norse mythology, the Viking Age, and the pre-Christian world, which thematically comprise a heavy metal style known as Viking metal. Viking metal originally emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s as an ideological offshoot of black metal, made popular by such bands as Bathory and Enslaved. Amon Amarth, though a death metal band, is often labeled as Viking metal due to its lyrical themes.

In regard to the band&#x27;s reputation as a Viking metal band, Imke von Helden writes in &quot;Barbarians and Literature: Viking Metal and its Links to Old Norse Mythology&quot; that &quot;During the 1990s, Swedish Amon Amarth added a new dimension to the definition of viking metal by means of its death metal style of music.&quot; She further explains in &quot;Scandinavian Metal Attack: The Power of Northern Europe in Extreme Metal&quot; that 

When asked to comment on the band&#x27;s genre, vocalist Johan Hegg remarked:

Hegg has also addressed the band&#x27;s relationship to the pagan metal phenomenon and its choice of subject matter:

Journalists have noted that, due to the co-opting of Viking and Norse mythology and symbolism by members of white supremacist or neo-Nazi groups (especially by metal bands with white supremacist or neo-Nazi members), Amon Amarth has sometimes been mistakenly assumed to be associated with such ideologies. As examples against such associations, Sophia DeBoick of &quot;The New European&quot; noted Hegg&#x27;s disapproval of a Kentucky official&#x27;s refusal to issue same-sex marriage licenses, as well as a disclaimer on the Grimfrost website which states that the company does not &quot;approve the usage of cultural features or the symbolism of our forefathers in association with white supremacy, racial elitism or other forms of extremism.&quot; &quot;Beat Magazine&quot;″s Kosa Monteith referred to the band&#x27;s Viking aesthetic as &quot;almost camp or kitschy&quot;, arguing that their resistance of the &quot;Viking metal&quot; label derives from &quot;Vikings being somewhat co-opted by the far right and fascists for their own shitty ends. Amon Amarth aren&#x27;t fascists. They&#x27;re not Nazis. Not even Scandi occultists [...] They don&#x27;t claim to be honouring the spiritual tradition of a thousand-year racial ancestry. The name? Not Norse. Not even Swedish. It&#x27;s Elvish: the name for Tolkien&#x27;s Mount Doom. They&#x27;re just pleasant dudes geeking out about fantasy and cool stories. Which is pretty metal.&quot;

<text>The Blood-Horse (also referred to simply as Blood-Horse and displayed on its nameplate in upright all-capital letters without hyphenation as BLOODHORSE) is a news magazine that originated in 1916 as a monthly bulletin of the Thoroughbred Horse Association. The corresponding online website publication is Bloodhorse.com. 
In 1935 the publication was purchased by the American Thoroughbred Breeders Association. From 1961 to 2015, it was owned by the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association (TOBA), a non-profit organization that promotes Thoroughbred racing, breeding, and ownership. The publication was issued by a subsidiary called Blood-Horse Publications from 2000 to 2015. In February 2015, the Jockey Club purchased a majority share in the publication. Long published as a weekly newsletter, the magazine became a monthly publication in April 2021, and the magazine and website are now published by a partnership entity of the Jockey Club Information Systems and TOBA called Blood-Horse LLC.

Based in Lexington, Kentucky, the publication&#x27;s media kit states that the magazine &quot;coverage includes race reporting, comprehensive analysis, events, trends, debate, farm management, pedigrees, people, profiles, medication issues, investigative reports, and breeding news and information, and anything newsworthy and important to the racing and breeding industry&quot;. In 2003, William Nack of ESPN referred to &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; as &quot;the thoroughbred industry&#x27;s most-respected trade publication&quot;.

The magazine won acclaim for its exclusive report indicating that 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand had been slaughtered by his owners overseas after a marginal stud career. The news resulted in increased efforts to save retired racehorses.

&quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; has an online version, at bloodhorse.com. In August 2015 &quot;Blood-Horse Daily&quot; was launched, with content available on an app, by email subscription or downloadable from the website.

For the new millennium, the magazine compiled a List of the Top 100 Racehorses of the 20th Century which was expanded into a book form.

The similarly titled &quot;Australian Bloodhorse Review&quot; is unaffiliated.

==History==
In 1916, the first Kentucky Thoroughbred Horse Association Bulletin was posted – Volume 1, Number 1 was published August 1, 1916, by the Kentucky Thoroughbred Horse Association to serve a small community of breeders. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; was renamed &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; and taken to a weekly frequency in 1929 and expanded to serve a global audience. The first issue of the public &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; was published May 11, 1929, and held Blue Larkspur as the cover image.

The last of the original members that published &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; was Thomas Piatt; A charter member in 1916, former VP of the old Thoroughbred Horse Association, and director of American Thoroughbred Breeders Association. He was also the founding member of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association.

Thomas Cromwell was the first editor of magazine. Joe Estes joined &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; in 1930 and later became the second editor-in-chief. He was succeeded by Kent Hollingsworth, Ed Bowen, Ray Paulick and Dan Liebman.

<text>USS &quot;Mugford&quot; (DD-105) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

==Description==
The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was an improved and faster version of the preceding . Two different designs were prepared to the same specification that mainly differed in the turbines and boilers used. The ships built to the Bethlehem Steel design, built in the Fore River and Union Iron Works shipyards, mostly used Yarrow boilers that deteriorated badly during service and were mostly scrapped during the 1930s. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . They had a crew of 6 officers and 108 enlisted men.

Performance differed radically between the ships of the class, often due to poor workmanship. The &quot;Wickes&quot; class was powered by two steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by four water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of intended to reach a speed of . The ships carried of fuel oil which was intended gave them a range of at .

The ships were armed with four 4-inch (102 mm) guns in single mounts and were fitted with two 1-pounder guns for anti-aircraft defense. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A &quot;Y-gun&quot; depth charge thrower was added to many ships.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Mugford&quot;, named for James Mugford, was laid down 20 December 1917 by Union Iron Works Company, San Francisco, California; launched 14 April 1918; sponsored by Mrs. George H. Fort; and commissioned 25 November 1918.

&quot;Mugford&quot; joined the fleet for winter exercises off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in January 1919, then sailed north for operations along the coast between New York and Massachusetts until 21 November, when she left Newport for San Diego, arriving 22 December. Here she became tender to a seaplane division, and during the pioneering days of naval aviation cruised with her charges on exercises along the California coast, visiting the Panama Canal Zone in December 1920 and January 1921.

&quot;Mugford&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego 7 June 1922, and was sold for scrap to Schiavone-Bonomo Corporation, New York City, in 1936.

<doc id="967422" wikidata="Q16107344" url="?curid=967422" title="George Hickes (Manitoba politician)">
<text>George Hickes (born 26 June 1946) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He has served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 until 2011, and was the Speaker of the Assembly from November 1999 to October 2011. He is a member of the New Democratic Party.

Hickes is the father of Nunavut politician George Hickes Jr., and the uncle of Nunavut politician Hunter Tootoo and hockey player Jordin Tootoo.

==Early life and career==
Hickes was born to an Inuit family near Ports Point in the Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), and was raised in Churchill, Manitoba. His early years alternated between traditional Inuit life and modern Canadian society. He caught beluga whales in his youth (a long-standing tradition in Inuit culture), and earned the nickname &quot;coldwater cowboy&quot; for working without the aid of nets. The descendants of whales caught by Hickes can still be seen in several aquariums throughout the world.

Hickes worked as a heavy equipment operator at the Tar Sands Project in Fort McMurray, Alberta in the early 1970s, and held a variety of jobs in Churchill during the same period. He joined Manitoba&#x27;s New Careers program in 1976, and later acknowledged that this decision saved him from a life of poverty. After graduating in 1978, Hickes became a trainer and coordinator for New Careers in Winnipeg until 1984. He later worked as executive director of the Limestone Training and Employment Agency near Gillam, Manitoba, and assisted in designing an education program for the Yukon.

==Provincial politics==

===Opposition member===
Hickes planned to challenge Elijah Harper for the NDP nomination in Rupertsland before the 1990 provincial election, but withdrew when Harper attained national prominence for blocking the Meech Lake Accord. He was instead elected for the north-end Winnipeg constituency of Point Douglas, which has a large aboriginal community. He has been returned in every election since then, and received almost 75% support in the 2003 election.

The NDP formed the Official Opposition in the Manitoba legislature from 1990 to 1999, and Hickes served as his party&#x27;s whip in this period. He played a prominent role in having November 8 designated as a day to recognize Manitoba&#x27;s aboriginal veterans, and successfully called for legislation requiring that cooking liqueurs sold in the province have no more than 25% alcohol content. The latter measure followed a series of deaths in Winnipeg involving Chinese cooking wine with a higher alcohol content. Hickes supported Lorne Nystrom&#x27;s bid to lead the federal New Democratic Party in 1995.

He spoke against plans to create an aboriginal political party in 1994, arguing that such a party could not effectively represent multicultural communities. Referring to his own Point Douglas riding, he said, &quot;You have Ukrainians, Filipinos, Chinese. What happens to them . . . if you&#x27;re running to represent only one group of people?&quot;

Manitoba&#x27;s electoral boundaries were redistributed in 1999. Hickes was challenged for the Point Douglas NDP nomination by fellow legislator Conrad Santos, whose Broadway constituency had been eliminated. He won the challenge, and Santos subsequently ran and was elected in the new division of Wellington.

===Speaker===

The NDP won a majority government in the 1999 election, and Hickes defeated Santos, Denis Rocan and Marcel Laurendeau in a free vote of the assembly to become its new speaker. He was the first speaker to be chosen in this manner, previous speakers having been appointed by the premier. He was re-elected speaker in 2003.
Hickes was re-elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 2007 provincial election. Shortly after, he was re-elected as speaker without opposition. Opposition party leaders Hugh McFadyen and Jon Gerrard both indicated that they regarded Hickes as fair and even-handed.

On February 10, 2011, Hickes announced that he would not seek re-election in the next provincial election.

<doc id="967430" wikidata="Q4403515" url="?curid=967430" title="USS Chew">
<text>USS &quot;Chew&quot; (DD-106) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and World War II.

From 1918 to 1922, &quot;Chew&quot; operated along the East Coast of the United States on patrol and training duties, including escorting a transatlantic voyage of Curtiss NC seaplanes. In 1940, she was recommissioned and operated out of Pearl Harbor. During the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, she brought her guns to bear against aircraft of the Empire of Japan, and two of her men were killed helping to man the battleship . For the remainder of the war, &quot;Chew&quot; operated out of the port on escort and patrol duties, until she was decommissioned in 1945.

==Namesake==
Samuel Chew was born circa 1750 in Virginia. A resident of Connecticut, was appointed by the Marine Committee on 17 June 1777 to command the Continental Navy brigantine with which he had much success against British commerce. The brigantine, carrying ten quarter-pounders, fell in with a British Letter-of-Marque (20 guns) on 4 March 1778. In the hand-to-hand struggle which ensued, Captain Chew was killed but his ship managed to break off the battle with its superior opponent and return safely to Boston.

== Design and construction ==
&quot;Chew&quot; was one of 111 s built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with seven of her sisters, were constructed at Union Iron Works shipyards in San Francisco, California using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel.

She had a standard displacement of an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . On trials, reached a speed of . She was armed with four 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and twelve torpedo tubes. She had a regular crew complement of 113 officers and enlisted men. She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.

Specifics on &quot;Chew&quot;″s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyers designed by Bethlehem Steel, built from a different design than the &#x27;Liberty type&#x27; destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The non-&#x27;Liberty&#x27; type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make at instead of the design standard of at . The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.

&quot;Chew&quot; was the first and only ship commissioned in the U.S. Navy named for Samuel Chew, who had been a Continental Navy officer killed in the Revolutionary War.

==Service history==
&quot;Chew&quot; was launched on 26 May 1918 out of San Francisco, sponsored by F. X. Gygax. She was commissioned on 12 December 1918.

She sailed for the East Coast of the United States on 21 December 1918, and arrived in port at Newport, Rhode Island on 10 January 1919. After brief repairs at port in New York City, New York and refresher training at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, she cleared New York on 28 April and embarked as an escort during the first transatlantic seaplane flight, made by Curtiss NC-4 aircraft. Following this duty, she visited to the Azores, Gibraltar, Malta, and Constantinople before returning to New York on 5 June. After repairs, she steamed for San Diego, California, leaving New York on 17 September and arriving in San Diego on 12 October. Beginning on 19 November 1919, she was placed in reduced commission, operating only infrequently with Naval reservists of Reserve Division 10 until she was placed out of commission on 1 June 1922.

At a part of the mobilization effort preceding the U.S. entry into World War II, &quot;Chew&quot; was recommissioned on 14 October 1940, assigned to Defense Force, 14th Naval District. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 17 December 1940 which she made her home port. She spent the next year conducting patrols and had training duty from Pearl Harbor. She was assigned to Destroyer Division 80, with sister ships and ., and the Sampson-class destroyer .

On the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;Chew&quot; was moored in Berth X-5, alongside &quot;Allen&quot; and the decommissioned , which was being used for storage. At the outbreak of the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan that morning, &quot;Chew&quot; brought one of her 3&quot;/23 caliber guns online and began firing at 08:03, under the command of her executive officer. At 08:11, two of her .50 caliber machine guns were also brought online and began firing. The gun scored one Japanese aircraft shot down and two damaged, and the machine guns observed no hits. &quot;Chew&quot; maintained continuous fire from these weapons until 09:34, when the last of the Japanese aircraft departed. She then got underway and began patrolling for Japanese submarine activity, just southwest of the port entrance buoy. She pinged eight possible contacts and dropped 28 depth charges, which her commander, H. R. Hummer, Jr., reported two Japanese submarines destroyed. Subsequent evidence does not suggest &quot;Chew&quot; struck any Japanese submarines. In the chaos of the attack, a number of &quot;Chew&quot; crew members also disembarked and came aboard nearby battleship , which was in drydock, to assist in manning guns, forming ammunition trains, and fighting fires. Aboard &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, two &quot;Chew&quot; crewman were killed in defending the ship, Seaman Second Class Matthew J. Agola and Fireman Third Class Clarence A. Wise.

From 1941 through the end of World War II, &quot;Chew&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor on patrol. She took on periodic escort duties among the Hawaiian Islands and on training duty for submarines. She made occasional trips to San Francisco and Seattle escorting convoys and screening for other Navy ships, inter-island escort, and submarine training duty. Following the end of the war, she departed Pearl Harbor on 21 August 1945 and arrived at Philadelphia 13 September. She was decommissioned there on 10 October 1945, and sold for scrap on 4 October 1946. &quot;Chew&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

The ship&#x27;s bell survived the scrapping and sold to private owner.

<doc id="967440" wikidata="Q245902" url="?curid=967440" title="Riesz–Thorin theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Riesz–Thorin theorem, often referred to as the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem or the Riesz–Thorin convexity theorem, is a result about &quot;interpolation of operators&quot;. It is named after Marcel Riesz and his student G. Olof Thorin.

This theorem bounds the norms of linear maps acting between spaces. Its usefulness stems from the fact that some of these spaces have rather simpler structure than others. Usually that refers to which is a Hilbert space, or to and . Therefore one may prove theorems about the more complicated cases by proving them in two simple cases and then using the Riesz–Thorin theorem to pass from the simple cases to the complicated cases. The Marcinkiewicz theorem is similar but applies also to a class of non-linear maps.

==Motivation==
First we need the following definition:

:Definition. Let be two numbers such that . Then for define by: .

By splitting up the function in as the product and applying Hölder&#x27;s inequality to its power, we obtain the following result, foundational in the study of -spaces:

This result, whose name derives from the convexity of the map on , implies that .

On the other hand, if we take the &quot;layer-cake decomposition&quot; , then we see that and , whence we obtain the following result:

In particular, the above result implies that is included in , the sumset of and in the space of all measurable functions. Therefore, we have the following chain of inclusions:

In practice, we often encounter operators defined on the sumset . For example, the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma shows that the Fourier transform maps boundedly into , and Plancherel&#x27;s theorem shows that the Fourier transform maps boundedly into itself, hence the Fourier transform formula_1 extends to by setting
formula_2
for all and . It is therefore natural to investigate the behavior of such operators on the &quot;intermediate subspaces&quot; .

To this end, we go back to our example and note that the Fourier transform on the sumset was obtained by taking the sum of two instantiations of the same operator, namely
formula_3
formula_4

These really are the &quot;same&quot; operator, in the sense that they agree on the subspace . Since the intersection contains simple functions, it is dense in both and . Densely defined continuous operators admit unique extensions, and so we are justified in considering formula_5 and formula_6 to be &quot;the same&quot;.

Therefore, the problem of studying operators on the sumset essentially reduces to the study of operators that map two natural domain spaces, and , boundedly to two target spaces: and , respectively. Since such operators map the sumset space to , it is natural to expect that these operators map the intermediate space to the corresponding intermediate space .

==Statement of the theorem==
There are several ways to state the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem; to be consistent with the notations in the previous section, we shall use the sumset formulation.

 \|T\|^{\theta}_{L^{p_1} \to L^{q_1}}.&lt;/math&gt;|}}

In other words, if is simultaneously of type and of type , then is of type for all . In this manner, the interpolation theorem lends itself to a pictorial description. Indeed, the Riesz diagram of is the collection of all points in the unit square such that is of type . The interpolation theorem states that the Riesz diagram of is a convex set: given two points in the Riesz diagram, the line segment that connects them will also be in the diagram.

The interpolation theorem was originally stated and proved by Marcel Riesz in 1927. The 1927 paper establishes the theorem only for the &quot;lower triangle&quot; of the Riesz diagram, viz., with the restriction that and . Olof Thorin extended the interpolation theorem to the entire square, removing the lower-triangle restriction. The proof of Thorin was originally published in 1938 and was subsequently expanded upon in his 1948 thesis.

==Proof==
We will first prove the result for simple functions and eventually show how the argument can be extended by density to all measurable functions.

===Simple functions===
By symmetry, let us assume formula_7 (the case formula_8 trivially follows from ()). Let formula_9 be a simple function, that is formula_10 for some finite formula_11, formula_12 and formula_13, formula_14. Similarly, let formula_15 denote a simple function formula_16, namely formula_17 for some finite formula_18, formula_19 and formula_20, formula_21.

Note that, since we are assuming formula_22 and formula_23 to be formula_24-finite metric spaces, formula_25 and formula_26 for all formula_27. Then, by proper normalization, we can assume formula_28 and formula_29, with formula_30 and with formula_31, formula_32 as defined by the theorem statement.

Next, we define the two complex functions formula_33 Note that, for formula_34, formula_35 and formula_36. We then extend formula_9 and formula_15 to depend on a complex parameter formula_39 as follows: formula_40 so that formula_41 and formula_42. Here, we are implicitly excluding the case formula_43, which yields formula_44: In that case, one can simply take formula_45, independently of formula_39, and the following argument will only require minor adaptations.

Let us now introduce the function formula_47 where formula_48 are constants independent of formula_39. We readily see that formula_50 is an entire function, bounded on the strip formula_51. Then, in order to prove (), we only need to show that &amp;&amp;\text{and} &amp; \left\vert\Phi(1 + \mathrm{i}y)\right\vert &amp;\le \|T\|_{L^{p_1} \to L^{q_1}}\end{aligned}&lt;/math&gt;|}} for all formula_52 and formula_53 as constructed above. Indeed, if () holds true, by Hadamard three-lines theorem, formula_54 for all formula_9 and formula_15. This means, by fixing formula_9, that formula_58 where the supremum is taken with respect to all formula_15 simple functions with formula_60. The left-hand side can be rewritten by means of the following lemma.

In our case, the lemma above implies formula_61 for all simple function formula_9 with formula_63. Equivalently, for a generic simple function, formula_64

====Proof of ()====
Let us now prove that our claim () is indeed certain. The sequence formula_65 consists of disjoint subsets in formula_66 and, thus, each formula_67 belongs to (at most) one of them, say formula_68. Then, for formula_69, formula_70 which implies that formula_71. With a parallel argument, each formula_72 belongs to (at most) one of the sets supporting formula_15, say formula_74, and formula_75

We can now bound formula_76: By applying Hölder’s inequality with conjugate exponents formula_77 and formula_78, we have formula_79

We can repeat the same process for formula_80 to obtain formula_81, formula_82 and, finally, formula_83

===Extension to all measurable functions in &quot;Lpθ&quot;===
So far, we have proven that \lVert f\rVert_{p_\theta}&lt;/math&gt;|}} when formula_9 is a simple function. As already mentioned, the inequality holds true for all formula_85 by the density of simple functions in formula_86.

Formally, let formula_85 and let formula_88 be a sequence of simple functions such that formula_89, for all formula_90, and formula_91 pointwise. Let formula_92 and define formula_93, formula_94, formula_95 and formula_96. Note that, since we are assuming formula_97, formula_98 and, equivalently, formula_99 and formula_100.

Let us see what happens in the limit for formula_101. Since formula_102, formula_103 and formula_104, by the dominated convergence theorem one readily has formula_105 Similarly, formula_106, formula_107 and formula_108 imply formula_109 and, by the linearity of formula_110 as an operator of types formula_111 and formula_112 (we have not proven yet that it is of type formula_113 for a generic formula_9) formula_115

It is now easy to prove that formula_116 and formula_117 in measure: For any formula_118, Chebyshev’s inequality yields formula_119 and similarly for formula_120. Then, formula_116 and formula_117 a.e. for some subsequence and, in turn, formula_123 a.e. Then, by Fatou’s lemma and recalling that () holds true for simple functions, formula_124

==Interpolation of analytic families of operators==
The proof outline presented in the above section readily generalizes to the case in which the operator is allowed to vary analytically. In fact, an analogous proof can be carried out to establish a bound on the entire function
formula_125
from which we obtain the following theorem of Elias Stein, published in his 1956 thesis:

The theory of real Hardy spaces and the space of bounded mean oscillations permits us to wield the Stein interpolation theorem argument in dealing with operators on the Hardy space and the space of bounded mean oscillations; this is a result of Charles Fefferman and Elias Stein.

==Applications==

===Hausdorff–Young inequality===

It has been shown in the first section that the Fourier transform formula_1 maps boundedly into and into itself. A similar argument shows that the Fourier series operator, which transforms periodic functions into functions formula_127 whose values are the Fourier coefficients
formula_128
maps boundedly into and into . The Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem now implies the following:
formula_129
where and . This is the Hausdorff–Young inequality.

The Hausdorff–Young inequality can also be established for the Fourier transform on locally compact Abelian groups. The norm estimate of 1 is not optimal. See the main article for references.

===Convolution operators===

Let be a fixed integrable function and let be the operator of convolution with , i.e., for each function we have .

It follows from Fubini&#x27;s theorem that is bounded from to and it is trivial that it is bounded from to (both bounds are by ). Therefore the Riesz–Thorin theorem gives
formula_130

We take this inequality and switch the role of the operator and the operand, or in other words, we think of as the operator of convolution with , and get that is bounded from to &quot;Lp&quot;. Further, since is in we get, in view of Hölder&#x27;s inequality, that is bounded from to , where again . So interpolating we get
formula_131
where the connection between &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; is
formula_132

===The Hilbert transform===
The Hilbert transform of is given by
formula_133
where p.v. indicates the Cauchy principal value of the integral. The Hilbert transform is a Fourier multiplier operator with a particularly simple multiplier:
formula_134

It follows from the Plancherel theorem that the Hilbert transform maps boundedly into itself.

Nevertheless, the Hilbert transform is not bounded on or , and so we cannot use the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem directly. To see why we do not have these endpoint bounds, it suffices to compute the Hilbert transform of the simple functions and . We can show, however, that
formula_135
for all Schwartz functions , and this identity can be used in conjunction with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to show that the Hilbert transform maps boundedly into itself for all . Interpolation now establishes the bound
formula_136
for all , and the self-adjointness of the Hilbert transform can be used to carry over these bounds to the case.

==Comparison with the real interpolation method==
While the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem and its variants are powerful tools that yield a clean estimate on the interpolated operator norms, they suffer from numerous defects: some minor, some more severe. Note first that the complex-analytic nature of the proof of the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem forces the scalar field to be . For extended-real-valued functions, this restriction can be bypassed by redefining the function to be finite everywhere—possible, as every integrable function must be finite almost everywhere. A more serious disadvantage is that, in practice, many operators, such as the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator and the Calderón–Zygmund operators, do not have good endpoint estimates. In the case of the Hilbert transform in the previous section, we were able to bypass this problem by explicitly computing the norm estimates at several midway points. This is cumbersome and is often not possible in more general scenarios. Since many such operators satisfy the weak-type estimates
formula_137
real interpolation theorems such as the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem are better-suited for them. Furthermore, a good number of important operators, such as the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, are only sublinear. This is not a hindrance to applying real interpolation methods, but complex interpolation methods are ill-equipped to handle non-linear operators. On the other hand, real interpolation methods, compared to complex interpolation methods, tend to produce worse estimates on the intermediate operator norms and do not behave as well off the diagonal in the Riesz diagram. The off-diagonal versions of the Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem require the formalism of Lorentz spaces and do not necessarily produce norm estimates on the -spaces.

==Mityagin&#x27;s theorem==
B. Mityagin extended the Riesz–Thorin theorem; this extension is formulated here in the special case of spaces of sequences with unconditional bases (cf. below).

Assume:
formula_138

Then
formula_139

for any unconditional Banach space of sequences , that is, for any formula_140 and any formula_141, formula_142.

The proof is based on the Krein–Milman theorem.

<text>Moshe Arens (; 27 December 1925 – 7 January 2019) was an Israeli aeronautical engineer, researcher, diplomat, and Likud politician. A member of the Knesset between 1973 and 1992 and again from 1999 until 2003, he served as Minister of Defense three times and once as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Arens also served as the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. and was a professor at the Technion in Haifa.

==Early life and education==
Arens was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, to a Jewish family. His father was an industrialist and his mother was a dentist. When he was a year old, his family moved to Riga, Latvia. where he attended elementary school. In 1939, Arens and his family emigrated to the United States, where his father had business interests. The family settled in New York City, where Arens attended George Washington High School.

Arens was a leader in the Betar youth movement, and during World War II served in the United States Army Corps of Engineers as a technical sergeant. Following the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, Arens emigrated to Israel and joined the militant group Irgun.

In 1951, he returned to the United States, and studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and aeronautical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, where he was a student of Qian Xuesen. He then worked for a time in the aircraft industry.

==Academic and research career==
In 1957, Arens became professor of aeronautics at the Technion, serving in this position until 1962. After retiring from the government, he devoted himself to researching and commemorating the story of the Jewish Military Union (ŻZW), which fought alongside the better known Jewish Combat Organization (ŻOB) in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Arens has written several articles and a book, &quot;Flags over the Warsaw Ghetto&quot;, on the revolt. The book has been published in Hebrew, Polish, and English.

Arens was chairman of the International Board of Governors of Ariel University Center of Samaria. He was also a columnist for Haaretz newspaper.

== Political career ==

After the Yom Kippur War, Arens entered politics and was elected to the Knesset as a member of Likud in the 1973 elections. After being re-elected in 1977, he became chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He voted against the Camp David Accords and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty. In 1980, Prime Minister Menachem Begin offered Arens the post of Minister of Defense, but he turned it down due to his disagreement over the terms of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty. Arens did not oppose peace with Egypt, but was opposed to certain aspects of the treaty, and thus did not want to have to oversee Israel&#x27;s evacuation from the Sinai.

He was re-elected again in 1981, but resigned from the Knesset on 19 January 1982 when appointed ambassador to the United States. At this point, he brought his young protégé, Benjamin Netanyahu, then 32, to work for him in Washington. He returned to Israel in February 1983 after being appointed Minister of Defense, replacing Ariel Sharon, who had been forced out of office following the Kahan Commission&#x27;s report on the Sabra and Shatila massacre. He was re-elected in 1984, but was only appointed Minister without Portfolio. After another re-election in 1988 he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs (with Netanyahu his deputy), and in 1990 returned to the Defense portfolio.

After Likud lost the 1992 elections, Arens retired from politics. He returned in 1999, however, to challenge Netanyahu for the Likud leadership. Although he won only 18% of the vote, Netanyahu appointed him Minister of Defense, replacing Yitzhak Mordechai, who had left Likud to establish the Centre Party. Although Arens returned to the Knesset after the 1999 elections, Likud lost the elections and he left the cabinet. He lost his seat for the final time in 2003.

Arens questioned the wisdom of Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Israeli procurement, given the neglected state of Israeli ground forces. In an article for Fathom Journal, Arens stated that he was a critic of unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, accusing its proponents of suffering from &quot;unilateral withdrawal syndrome&quot;.

==Personal life==
While living in the United States, Arens married Muriel F. Eisenberg from New York City, and she moved to Israel with him. The couple had four children, two boys and two girls: Yigal, Aliza, Raanan, and Ruth. Arens died on 7 January 2019 at the age of 93. Streets in Ramla, Herzliya and Beit Shemesh are named after him.

<doc id="967455" wikidata="Q7411106" url="?curid=967455" title="Samuel Chew (justice)">
<text>Samuel Chew ( – ) was a physician who served as chief justice of colonial Delaware.

==Life==
Samuel was the third of a line of sons to bear the name. Samuel (III) was the son of Samuel Chew (II) who married Henrietta Maria Lloyd with later relation to William Paca. The first Samuel (I) &quot;of Herrington&quot; was the son of John Chew, a burgess who emigrated to Virginia in 1622 aboard the &quot;Seaflower&quot;.

Samuel married Mary Galloway in 1715, and their son Benjamin Chew was later Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. His first wife died in 1734, and he married Mary Paca Galloway in 1736. Originally he lived on his family&#x27;s estate of Maidstone in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The manor house still stands although, since borders have changed, it is now in Calvert County, Maryland.

In 1738, he moved to build an estate known as Whitehall in Kent County, Delaware. Pennsylvania Governor John Penn appointed him Chief Justice of the lower counties (or Delaware) in 1741.

Chew was influential among the Quakers, but provoked criticism by an address to the grand jury of Newcastle on the lawfulness of resistance to an armed enemy (printed 1741, reprinted in 1775).

<doc id="967481" wikidata="Q6487218" url="?curid=967481" title="Lankhmar">
<text>Lankhmar is a fictional city in the &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; stories by Fritz Leiber. It is situated on the world of Nehwon, just west of the Great Salt Marsh and east of the River Hlal, and serves as the home of Leiber&#x27;s two antiheroes.

== Description ==
Lankhmar is richly described as a populous and labyrinthine city rife with corruption, &quot;the City of the Black Toga.&quot; It is decadent or squalid in roughly equal parts and said to be so shrouded by smog that the stars are rarely sighted (the city&#x27;s alternate name is &quot;the City of Sevenscore Thousand Smokes&quot;). Located next to the Inner Sea, Lankhmar is visited by ships from across Nehwon and is the starting point for Fafhrd and the Mouser&#x27;s many sea voyages.

The city is ostensibly ruled by an overlord and his nobility. The Thieves&#x27; Guild is influential, too, and controls Lankhmar&#x27;s abundant criminal element, with the notable exceptions of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.

Streets in Lankhmar are often evocatively named (the Thieves&#x27; Guild is located on Cheap Street near Death&#x27;s Alley and Murder Alley). Commonly referenced locations are the Silver Eel Tavern, behind which is Bone Alley, and the Golden Lamprey Inn. The main meeting place is the Plaza of Dark Delights, which is the setting for the story &quot;The Bazaar of the Bizarre&quot;. The religious center of Lankhmar is the Street of the Gods (the Gods in Lankhmar), along which numerous (and often bizarre) cults seek to arrange themselves in order of popularity. The true gods of Lankhmar, however, are feared rather than worshipped. These &quot;Black Bones&quot; (mummified ancestors of the Lankhmarese) occasionally leave their temple and battle threats to the city—or threats to their own position as the preeminent religion within Lankhmar.

Beneath Lankhmar is an underground city inhabited by sentient rats. At one point, the Mouser, magically reduced in size, infiltrates this hidden world.

Leiber&#x27;s Lankhmar bears considerable similarity to 16th Century Seville as depicted in Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; classical picaresque tale &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot;: a bustling, cosmopolitan maritime city, into whose port galleons sail laden with gold from which only a few benefit, with a thoroughly corrupt civil government and a powerful and well-organized Thieves&#x27; Guild—all seen through the eyes of two young adventurers who formed a partnership to guard each other&#x27;s back in this dangerous milieu. However, Cervantes&#x27; protagonists, less daring than Leiber&#x27;s, do not confront the Thieves&#x27; Guild but instead enter its ranks.

In its earliest incarnations, Lankhmar was sometimes called &quot;Lankmar&quot; or &quot;Lahkmar&quot;. The change in the final published spelling may have been due to Leiber misreading some of the early maps created by Harry Fischer and his wife Martha.

==In games ==

=== Board games ===

In 1937, Leiber and his college friend Harry Fischer created a wargame set within the world of Nehwon, which Fischer had helped to create. This game initially used the &quot;Lahkmar&quot; spelling, and was played on a large (five by two and a half feet) three-dimensional board. Later, they created a board game called &quot;Lankhmar&quot; which was released by TSR in 1976.

The first edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game book &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; (1980, renamed &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; in 1985) and the second edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; book &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; both include a section on the Nehwon mythos, and stats out several characters from the books as well as gods and monsters.

&quot;Lankhmar – City of Adventure&quot; (1985) was a supplement produced by TSR for their &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) role-playing game containing maps, descriptions of the city areas, game statistics for various prominent characters from the stories, and ideas for adventures in and around the city. It was updated in 1993 under the same name for use with 2nd edition AD&amp;D. Several modules and accessories were produced for use with &quot;City of Adventure&quot;.

&quot;The New Adventures of Fafhrd and Gray Mouser&quot; (1996) was a boxed set that replaced &quot;Lankhmar, City of Adventure&quot; and could be used as an AD&amp;D supplement or a standalone RPG with simplified AD&amp;D rules.

For many years, the role-playing magazine &quot;Dragon&quot; ran a column introducing magical treasures, under the name &quot;Bazaar of the Bizarre&quot;, in honour of the magical emporium in Lankhmar (and Leiber&#x27;s story of the same name). When the column&#x27;s name was changed, there was sufficient outcry from readers for the name to be reinstated.

==== Other games ====

In 2006, Mongoose Publishing began publishing a number of Lankhmar-themed roleplaying books based on its revival of the RuneQuest roleplaying game system, starting with &quot;Lankhmar&quot; () and &quot;Lankhmar: Nehwon&quot; ().

In 2015, Pinnacle Entertainment Group released &quot;Lankhmar: City of Thieves&quot; along with a collection of supplements and accessories including a player&#x27;s guide, maps, adventures, character archetypes, and a gamemaster&#x27;s screen.

Goodman Games released its &quot;DCC Lankhmar&quot; boxed set in 2019 as a supplement to the &quot;Dungeon Crawl Classics&quot; roleplaying game. This set introduces modifications of the base &quot;DCC&quot; rules for a style of play more consistent with Leiber&#x27;s writing, as well a city guide, and an introductory adventure.

==Influence==
The fictional city of Ankh-Morpork from Terry Pratchett&#x27;s Discworld draws influence from Lankhmar, among several other real and fictitious cities. Two key characters in Pratchett&#x27;s first Discworld novel, &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, are Bravd and the Weasel, a reference to Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, and the name &quot;Ankh-Morpork&quot; is itself a partial anagram of &quot;Lankhmar&quot;.

<text>Gaochang (; Old Uyghur: &quot;Qocho&quot;), also called Khocho, Karakhoja, Qara-hoja, Kara-Khoja or Karahoja (قاراغوجا in Uyghur), was an ancient oasis city on the northern rim of the inhospitable Taklamakan Desert in present-day Sanbu Township, Xinjiang, China. The site is also known in published reports as Chotscho, Khocho, Qocho or Qočo. During the Yuan dynasty and Ming dynasty, Gaochang was referred to as &quot;Halahezhuo&quot; () (Qara-khoja) and Huozhou. Artistic depictions of the city have been published by Albert von Le Coq. Gaochang is considered in some sources to have been a &quot;Chinese colony&quot;, that is, it was located in a region otherwise occupied at the time by West Eurasian peoples.

A busy trading center, it was a stopping point for merchant traders traveling on the Silk Road. It was destroyed in wars during the 14th century and old palace ruins and inside and outside cities can still be seen today. Along with other sites along the historic Silk Road, Gaocheng was inscribed in 2014 on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the Silk Roads: the Routes Network of Chang&#x27;an-Tianshan Corridor World Heritage Site.

Near Gaochang is another major archeological site: the Astana tombs.

==History==

===Subeshi culture (1100-100 BCE)===

One of the earliest cultures of the region was the Iron Age Subeshi culture (1100-100 BCE). The Subeshi culture contributes some of the later period Tarim Mummies. The culture is probably associated with the Cheshi state (車師, Chü-shih, Jushi Kingdom) known from Chinese historical sources. The Subeshi culture is documented by three closely related cemeteries the , the , and the .

===Jushi Kingdom and early Han Chinese rule===

The region around Turfan was described during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) as being occupied by the &quot;Jūshī&quot; (Jushi Kingdom), while control over the region swayed between the Han Chinese and the Xiongnu.
Gaochang was built in the 1st century BC, it was an important site along the Silk Road. It played a key role as a transportation hub in Western China. The Jushi leaders later pledged their allegiance to the Han dynasty. In 327, the Gaochang Commandery (&quot;jùn&quot;) was created by the Former Liang under the Han Chinese ruler Zhang Jun. The Chinese set up a military colony/garrison and organized the land into multiple divisions. Han Chinese colonists from the Hexi region and the central plains also settled in the region.

After the fall of the Western Jin dynasty, Northern China split into multiple states, including the Central Asian oases. Gaochang was ruled by the Former Liang, Former Qin and Northern Liang as part of a commandery. In 383 the general Lu Guang of the Former Qin seized control of the region.

In 439, remnants of the Northern Liang, led by Juqu Wuhui and Juqu Anzhou, fled to Gaochang where they would hold onto power until 460 when they were conquered by the Rouran Khaganate. Another version of this story says that in 439 a man named Ashina led 500 families from Gansu to Gaochang. In 460, the Rouran forced them to move to the Altai. They became the Ashina clan that formed the Göktürk Khaganate

Six Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings.

===Gaochang Kingdom===

From the mid-5th century until the mid-7th century, the Gaochang Kingdom was successively controlled by the Kan, Zhang, Ma and Qu clans.

At the time of its conquest by the Rouran Khaganate, there were more than ten thousand Han Chinese households in Gaochang. The Rouran Khaganate, which was based in Mongolia, appointed a Han Chinese named Kan Bozhou to rule as King of Gaochang in 460, and it became a separate vassal kingdom of the Khaganate. Kan was dependent on Rouran backing. Yicheng and Shougui were the last two kings of the Chinese Kan family to rule Gaochang.

At this time the Gaoche () was rising to challenge power of the Rouran in the Tarim Basin. The Gaoche king Afuzhiluo () killed King Kan Shougui, who was the nephew of Kan Bozhou. and appointed a Han from Dunhuang, named Zhang Mengming (張孟明), as his own vassal King of Gaochang. Gaochang thus passed under Gaoche rule.

Later, Zhang Mengming was killed in an uprising by the people of Gaochang and replaced by Ma Ru (). In 501, Ma Ru himself was overthrown and killed, and the people of Gaochang appointed Qu Jia () of Jincheng (in Gansu) as their king, forming the Qushi Kingdom (麹氏王国, 501-640 CE). Qu Jia hailed from the Zhong district of Jincheng commandery (金城, roughly corresponding to modern day Lanzhou, Gansu) Qu Jia at first pledged allegiance to the Rouran, but the Rouran khaghan was soon killed by the Gaoche and he had to submit to Gaoche overlordship. During Qu rule, powerful families established marriage ties with each other and dominated the kingdom, they included the Zhang, Fan, Yin, Ma, Shi and Xin families. Later, when the Göktürks emerged as the supreme power in the region, the Qu dynasty of Gaochang became vassals of the Göktürks.

While the material civilization of Kucha to its west in this period remained chiefly Indo-Iranian in character, in Gaochang it gradually merged into the Tang aesthetics. In 607 the ruler of Gaochang Qu Boya paid tribute to the Sui dynasty, but his attempt at sinicization provoked a coup which overthrew the Qu ruler. The Qu family was restored six years later and the successor Qu Wentai welcomed the Tang pilgrim Xuanzang with great enthusiasm in 629 AD.

The Kingdom of Gaochang was made out of Han Chinese migrants and ruled by the Han Chinese Qu family which originated from Gansu. Jincheng commandery 金城 (Lanzhou), district of Yuzhong 榆中 was the home of the Qu Jia. The Qu family was linked by marriage alliances to the Turks, with a Turk being the grandmother of King Qu Boya&#x27;s. During this period, Gaochang&#x27;s administration, language, city planning, and Confucian society was so heavily dominated by Chinese models that it was known in Sogdian as &quot;Chinatown&quot;, a usage which continued as late as the tenth-century Persian geography &quot;Ḥudūd al-‘Ālam&quot;.

===Tang rule===
However, fearing Tang expansion, Qu Wentai later formed an alliance with the Western Turks and rebelled against Tang suzerainty. Emperor Taizong sent an army led by General Hou Junji against the kingdom in 640 and Qu Wentai apparently died of shock at news of the approaching army. Gaochang was annexed by the Chinese Tang dynasty and turned into a sub-prefecture of Xizhou (西州) and the seat of government of Anxi (安西). Before the Chinese conquered Gaochang, it was an impediment to Chinese access to Tarim and Transoxiania.

Gaochang was populated by Han people and Shanxi (Hedong) was the original home of the royal family at the time of the Tang dynasty&#x27;s annexation. The Tang dynasty accepted arguments at court who said that because Gaochang was Han populated that they needed to annex it.

Under Tang rule, Gaochang was inhabited by Chinese, Sogdians and Tocharians.

7th or 8th century old dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.

The Tang dynasty became greatly weakened due to the An Lushan Rebellion and in 755, the Chinese were forced to pull back their soldiers from the region. The area was first taken by the Tibetans, then finally by the Uyghurs in 803, who called the area Kocho (Qocho).


===Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho===
After 840 Gaochang became occupied by remnants of the Uyghur Khaganate fleeing Yenisei Kirghiz invasion of their land. The Uyghurs established the Kingdom of Qocho (Kara-Khoja) in 850. The inhabitants of Qocho practiced Buddhism, Manichaeism and Christianity. The Uyghurs converted to Buddhism and sponsored building of temple caves in the nearby Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves where depictions of Uyghur sponsors may be seen. The Buddhist Uyghur kings, who called themselves idiquts, retained their nomadic lifestyle, residing in Qocho during the winter, but moved to the cooler Bishbalik near Urumchi in the summer.

Qocho later became a vassal state of the Kara-Khitans. However, In 1209, the idiqut Barchuq offered Genghis Khan the suzerainty of his kingdom, and went personally to Genghis Khan with a sizeable tribute when demanded in 1211. The Uyghurs thus went into the service of the Mongols, who later formed the Yuan dynasty in the territories of what is now China. The Uyghurs became bureaucrats (&quot;semu&quot;) of the Mongol Empire and their Uyghur script was modified for Mongolian. As far south as Quanzhou, preponderance of Gaochang Uyghur in Church of the East inscriptions of the Yuan period attests to their importance in the Christian community there.

The Gaochang area was conquered by the Mongols of the Chagatai Khanate (not part of the Yuan dynasty) from 1275 to 1318 by as many as 120,000 troops. The buddhist uyghurs were all genocided very few escaped to China gansu and became the Yugurs

==Buddhism==
Buddhism spread to China from India along the northern branch of the Silk Road predominantly in the 4th and 5th centuries as the Liang rulers were Buddhists. The building of Buddhist grottos probably began during this period. There are clusters close to Gaochang, the largest being the Bezeklik grottos.

<text>Messier 77 (M77), also known as [[New General Catalogue|NGC]] 1068 or the Squid Galaxy, is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Cetus. It is about away from Earth, and was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1780, who originally described it as a nebula. Méchain then communicated his discovery to Charles Messier, who subsequently listed the object in his catalog. Both Messier and William Herschel described this galaxy as a star cluster. Today, however, the object is known to be a galaxy. It is one of the brightest Seyfert galaxies visible from Earth and has a D25 isophotal diameter of about .

The morphological classification of NGC 1068 in the De Vaucouleurs system is (R)SA(rs)b, where the &#x27;(R)&#x27; indicates an outer ring-like structure, &#x27;SA&#x27; denotes a non-barred spiral, &#x27;(rs)&#x27; means a transitional inner ring/spiral structure, and &#x27;b&#x27; says the spiral arms are moderately wound. Ann et al. (2015) gave it a class of SAa, suggesting tightly wound arms. However, infrared images of the inner part of the galaxy reveal a prominent bar not seen in visual light, and for this reason it is now considered a barred spiral. Messier 77 is the largest member of a small group of galaxies, which includes NGC 1055, an edge-on spiral galaxy likely twisted by gravitational interactions with Messier 77, and five small irregular galaxies. 

Messier 77 is an active galaxy with an active galactic nucleus (AGN), which is obscured from view by astronomical dust at visible wavelengths. The diameter of the molecular disk and hot plasma associated with the obscuring material was first measured at radio wavelengths by the VLBA and VLA. The hot dust around the nucleus was subsequently measured in the mid-infrared by the MIDI instrument at the VLTI. It is the brightest and one of the closest and best-studied type 2 Seyfert galaxies, forming a prototype of this class.

It has been proposed that type 2 Seyfert galaxies are the same class of object as type 1 Seyfert galaxies, viewed from such an angle that the type 1 core is hidden from view. An analysis of NGC 1068&#x27;s spectra using Interferometry by Tacconi et al. (1994) suggested that the galaxy&#x27;s Seyfert 1 core was obstructed by a thick Molecular cloud region.
X-ray source 1H 0244+001 in Cetus has been identified as Messier 77. Only one supernova has been detected in Messier 77. The supernova, named SN 2018ivc, was discovered on 24 November 2018 by the DLT40 Survey. It is a type II supernova, and at discovery it was 15th magnitude and brightening.

It has a radio jet consisting of a northeast and a southwest region, caused by interactions with the interstellar medium.The presence of bow shocks in the northeast region due to these interactions overlap with the edges of molecular outflow, suggesting that the jet is responsible for the outflow. 

In February 2022 astronomers reported a cloud of cosmic dust, detected through infrared interferometry observations, located at the centre of Messier 77 that is hiding a supermassive black hole.

In November 2022, the IceCube collaboration announced the detection of a neutrino source emitted by the active galactic nucleus of Messier 77. It is the second detection by IceCube after TXS 0506+056, and only the fourth known source including SN1987A and solar neutrinos. A potential candidate for the source of these neutrinos is the magnetic corona surrounding the active galactic nucleus, providing powerful enough particle acceleration to cause neutron radiation phenomena.

<text>Robert P. Linn (December 27, 1908 – August 22, 2004) was among the longest-serving mayors in the United States. Linn, a Republican, served 58 years as the mayor of Beaver, Pennsylvania, a borough around northwest of Pittsburgh.

==Biography==
Linn was born in Burgettstown and grew up in Beaver. He worked for the Duquesne Light Company, and in 1945 was approached by a group of Republicans who wanted to defeat the incumbent mayor, a position then known as burgess. Initially, he did not want the job, but later gave in. Afterward he changed his mind, taking out a newspaper advertisement telling people to vote for his opponent. He won the election anyway and took office on January 2, 1946. Linn continued to serve as mayor for the next five decades. The position&#x27;s original salary was $2,500 per year.

In 1995, he was officially listed in &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the longest-serving mayor in the United States; in a 2002 interview, he said his major accomplishment in office was starting Streetscape, a town beautification project that replaced concrete sidewalks with red bricks and removed power lines from the main street.

Linn died in his sleep at his home in 2004 at the age of 95 and in the middle of his fifteenth term. The town council appointed councilman Thomas Hamilton to replace him.

He resided in a yellow apartment on Wilson Ave.

<doc id="967495" wikidata="Q7752977" url="?curid=967495" title="The NBC Monday Movie">
<text>The NBC Monday Movie was a television anthology series of films that debuted on February 4, 1963 (in the middle of the 1962-63 season). It was referred to as Monday Night at the Movies prior to the mid-1980s. Contrary to popular contemporary belief, the corporate initials, &quot;NBC&quot;, were, at first, not part of the official title for the network&#x27;s anthologies of old movies, and would not be for years to come. Thus, in 1964, when the show was transferred by the network&#x27;s programming executives to Wednesday nights, it became Wednesday Night at the Movies. And in 1965, when the program moved to Tuesdays, it became Tuesday Night at the Movies. It would remain there until 1969. The name would henceforth change depending on whichever night of the week the program aired. Moreover, by 1968, there was once again a weekly Monday Night at the Movies on the air. It ran until 1997.

In the latter years of &quot;Monday Night at the Movies&quot;&#x27; run, more and more made-for-TV movies were showcased, while theatrical films, fewer in number, were edited for content, to remove objectionable material, and occasionally, but not always, to reduce the film&#x27;s running time to fit into the two-hour time slot. Most widescreen films were pan-and-scanned so the image would fit the standard 4:3 television screen (as opposed to letterbox format). An exception was the 1951 film version of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, which made its television debut on &quot;Monday Night at the Movies&quot; in 1972. &quot;Show Boat&quot; had been produced by MGM before the advent of widescreen American films in 1953. It was a rather unusual offering since (then) it was a twenty-one-year-old film. (In fact, the oldest film shown on any of NBC&#x27;s &quot;At the Movies&quot; anthologies was &quot;Saratoga Trunk&quot; (1945), which aired on &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;, January 13, 1968, 23 years after its Hollywood premiere.)

==Background==
The idea for the show came about when advertisers opted out of two 60-minute shows the network ran on Monday nights for the 1962–1963 season -- &quot;It&#x27;s A Man&#x27;s World&quot; (from 7:30-8:30 pm, Eastern Time) and &quot;Saints and Sinners&quot; (from 8:30-9:30), the latter of which suffered from having &quot;no chemistry, and never any real ratings.&quot; Having experienced some audience success with &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; ever since its premiere in Fall 1961, the network decided to acquire more feature films as a stop-gap measure for NBC&#x27;s dismal numbers on Monday nights. Thus, a package of 42 movies from 20th Century Fox and 35 titles from MGM were purchased by the network for both its Monday and Saturday night movie series at a cost of $14 million. With a 7:30 pm (EST) start time, the movies of the show&#x27;s first season were made up of mostly action-adventures, an occasional romance such as &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot;, and two Pat Boone musicals. These films usually ran under 100 minutes, the normal running-time for a two-hour movie slot (with commercial interruptions) in 1963.

==The first two series of films (February 1963-April 1964)==
The first incarnation of &quot;Monday Night at the Movies&quot; lasted from February 1963 until early September 1964. Despite the promise of big name stars each week, the series was no match for the CBS lineup of game shows and sitcoms such as &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;. In hopes of better ratings and to re-coup some of their investment, the films in the second list below would be re-broadcast on &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; in the late spring and summer of 1964.

Unless otherwise indicated, all films aired from 7:30pm–9:30pm Eastern Time on Monday Nights. The last number in the second list below notes the Nielsen rating the movie received:

These first sixteen titles (all produced by 20th Century Fox studios) were aired on the following dates:

# (1963-02-04) &quot;The Enemy Below&quot; (1957)
# (1963-02-11) &quot;The Bravados&quot; (1958)
# (1963-02-18) &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; (1957)
# (1963-02-25) &quot;King of the Khyber Rifles&quot; (1953)
# (1963-03-04) &quot;Hell and High Water&quot; (1954)
# (1963-03-11) &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954)
# (1963-03-18) &quot;Boy on a Dolphin&quot; (1957)
# (1963-03-25) &quot;From Hell to Texas&quot; (1958)
# (1963-04-01) &quot;My Cousin Rachel&quot; (1952)
# (1963-04-08) &quot;April Love&quot; (1957)
# (1963-04-15) &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957) (2 hrs, 30 min.)
# (1963-04-22) &quot;The Barbarian and the Geisha&quot; (1958)
# (1963-04-29) &quot;The Hunters&quot; (1958)
# (1963-05-06) &quot;Harry Black and the Tiger&quot; (1958)
# (1963-05-13) &quot;The Mudlark&quot; (1950)
# (1963-05-20) &quot;Mardi Gras&quot; (1958)
From here through September 9, the above titles were rerun on Monday nights. None of them appeared on NBC&#x27;s other film series, &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;. The second season began below and mixed in MGM titles with those of 20th Century Fox. Like the above-listed films, these were all television premieres. The Nielsen ratings are listed next to the release year of each title.

One interesting note: There is no entry below for November 25, 1963. This was the Monday after the Friday that President John Kennedy was assassinated. Monday was the date of the state funeral, which was given all-day coverage by the networks. Understandably, NBC thus postponed broadcasting the musical &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (originally slated for 1963-11-25) until later in the season.

From here, reruns were shown for the remainder of the season until mid-September 1964, when NBC announced that it would discontinue &quot;Monday Night at the Movies&quot;. Instead, a new prime-time movie night, Wednesdays, from 9 until 11 p.m. (ET), became the time slot for the network&#x27;s alternative film anthology during the 1964–65 season while Saturday nights remained a mainstay for NBC&#x27;s film broadcasts.

<text>Standard Oil of Colorado was chartered in Denver, Colorado in 1922. It was eventually rechartered under the name Standard Oil Company of Colorado in 1927 and began to sell stock in 1930.

Standard Oil of Colorado was not related to the well known Standard Oil company and did not own any wells, refineries, or gasoline stations.

It was sued in 1931 by Standard Oil of Indiana (which was interested in expanding its marketing influence into the Colorado area) over use of the &quot;Standard Oil&quot; name. By 1934, the courts ruled in favor of Standard Oil Company of Indiana, and Standard Oil of Colorado was disbanded.</text><links>

<doc id="967506" wikidata="Q3199353" url="?curid=967506" title="Kuchean language">
<text>Kuchean (also known as Tocharian B or West Tocharian) was a Western member of the Tocharian branch of Indo-European languages, extinct from the ninth century. Once spoken in the Tarim Basin in Central Asia, Tocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected. The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha. There is also the middle (&#x27;classicalʼ), and the late stage. 

==Nomenclature==
According to Peyrot, the self-designation for the language was &quot;kuśi&quot; &#x27;Kuča&#x27;. In scholarly works, it is known as Tocharian B, sometimes referred to as West Tocharian or Kuchean.

==Overview==

According to scholar Michael Peyrot, Tocharian B is dated between the 5th and 10th centuries AD, and was spread from Kuča to Yānqi and Turfan. Paul Widmer, following Tamai&#x27;s and Adams&#x27;s studies, situates Tocharian B roughly between 400 and 1200, its oldest layer dating from ca. 400 to 600, around &quot;Kucha and environs&quot;.

=== Documentation ===
According to J. H. W. Penney, Tocharian B is reported to be documented as Buddhist religious literature, and as secular material &quot;pertaining to everyday life&quot;.

<doc id="967508" wikidata="Q826713" url="?curid=967508" title="Pumpkinseed">
<text>The pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), also referred to as sun perch, pond perch, common sunfish, punkie,sunfish, sunny, and kivver, is a small to medium–sized freshwater fish of the genus &quot;Lepomis&quot; (true sunfishes), from the sunfish family (Centrarchidae) in the order Centrarchiformes. It is endemic to eastern North America.

==Distribution and habitat==
The pumpkinseed&#x27;s natural range in North America is from New Brunswick down the east coast to South Carolina. It then runs inland to the middle of North America, and extends through Iowa and back through Pennsylvania.
Pumpkinseed sunfish have however been introduced throughout most of North America. They can now be found from Washington and Oregon on the Pacific Coast to Georgia on the Atlantic Coast. Yet they are primarily found in the northeastern United States and more rarely in the south-central or southwestern region of the continent.

In Europe, the pumpkinseed is considered an invasive species. They were introduced to European waters, and could outcompete native fish. This species is included since 2019 in the list of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern (the Union list). It cannot be imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or intentionally released into the environment in the whole of the European Union.

The pumpkinseed has also been introduced to the United Kingdom, having arrived in the country around the same time as the populations in Continental Europe. Its range is believed to be restricted to Southern England and the West Country, with stable populations found in East Sussex, West Sussex and Somerset, though the species may potentially be present in the vicinity of London as well.

==Description==
Pumpkinseeds have a body shaped much like a pumpkin seed (thus the common name), typically about but up to in length. They typically weigh less than , with the world record being caught by Robert Warne while fishing Honeoye Lake, Upstate New York in 2016. They are orange, green, yellow or blue in color, with speckles over their sides and back and a yellow-orange breast and belly, and the coloration of the ctenoid scales of the pumpkinseed is one of the most vibrant of any freshwater fish and can range from an olive-green or brown to bright orange and blue. The sides are covered with vertical bars that are a faint green or blue, which are typically more prevalent in female pumpkinseeds. Orange spots may cover the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins and the cheeks have blue lines across them. The pumpkinseed is noted for the orange-red spot on the margin of its black gill cover. The pectoral fins of a pumpkinseed can be amber or clear, while the dorsal spines are black. They have a small mouth with an upper jaw stopping right under the eye.

Pumpkinseeds are very similar to the larger bluegill, and are often found in the same habitats. One difference between the two species is their opercular flap, which is black in both species but the pumpkinseed has a crimson spot in the shape of a half moon on the back portion. Pumpkinseeds have seven or eight vertical, irregular bands on their sides that are duller in color compared to the bluegill.

==Habitat==
Pumpkinseeds typically live in warm, calm lakes, ponds, and pools of creeks and small rivers with plenty of vegetation. They prefer clear water where they can find shelter to hide. They tend to stay near the shore and can be found in numbers within shallow and protected areas. They will feed at all water levels from the surface to the bottom in the daylight, and their heaviest feeding will be in the afternoon. Pumpkinseed sunfish usually travel together in schools that can also include bluegills and other sunfish.

Pumpkinseeds are more tolerant of low oxygen levels than bluegills are, but less tolerant of warm water. Groups of young fish school close to shore, but adults tend to travel in groups of two to four in slightly deeper yet still covered waters. Pumpkinseeds are active throughout the day, but they rest at night near the bottom or in shelter areas in rocks or near submerged logs.

==Dietary habits==
Pumpkinseeds are carnivorous and feed on a variety of small prey both at the water surface and at the bottom. Among their favorites are insects, small molluscs and crustaceans (such as small crawfish), worms, minnow fry, small frogs or tadpoles, and even cannibalizing other smaller pumpkinseeds. They are effective at destroying mosquito larvae and even occasionally consume small pieces of aquatic vegetation and detritus. They also will readily consume human food scraps, most notably bread which is commonly used for bait.

The pumpkinseed sunfish has a terminal mouth, allowing it to open at the anterior end of the snout. Pumpkinseed sunfish that live in waters with larger gastropods have larger mouths and associated jaw muscles to crack the shells.

==Sport fishing==
The pumpkinseed sunfish are typically very likely to bite on a worm bait, which makes them easy to catch while angling. Many fishermen consider the pumpkinseed to be a nuisance fish, as it bites so easily and frequently when the fisherman is attempting to catch something else. The pumpkinseeds are very popular with young fishermen due to their willingness to bite, their abundance and close locations to the shore. Although many people consider the meat of a pumpkinseed to be good-tasting, it is typically not a popular sport fish due to its small size.

Because pumpkinseeds tend to remain in the shallows and feed all day, pumpkinseeds are relatively easy to catch via bank fishing. They will bite at most bait – including garden worms, insects, leeches, or bits of fish meat. They will also take small lures and can be fished for with a fly rod with wet or dry flies. They will also hit at grubs early in the winter, but are less active from mid- to late winter. They may be easy to catch and popular with the youngest anglers, but pumpkinseeds are often sought by adults as well. The fish do put up an aggressive fight on line, and they have an excellent flavor and are low in fat and high in protein.

The IGFA world record for the species stands at , caught near Honeoye, New York, in 2016.

==Conservation status==
The pumpkinseed sunfish is very common and is not listed by CITES. It is considered Least Concern (not threatened) by the IUCN. Spawning grounds of the pumpkinseeds can be disturbed by shoreline development and shoreline erosion from heavy lake use. Their susceptibility to silt and pollution makes the pumpkinseed a good indicator of the cleanliness and health of water.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Once water temperatures reach in the late spring or early summer, the male pumpkinseeds will begin to build nests. Nesting sites are typically in shallow water on sand or gravel lake bottoms. The males will use their caudal fins to sweep out shallow, oval-shaped nesting holes that stretch about twice the length of the pumpkinseed itself. The fish will remove debris and large rocks from their nests with their mouths.

Nests are arranged in colonies consisting of about three to 15 nests each. Often, pumpkinseeds build their nests near bluegill colonies, and the two species interbreed. Male pumpkinseeds are vigorous and aggressive, and defend their nests by spreading their opercula. Because of this aggressive behavior, pumpkinseeds tend to maintain larger territories than bluegills.

Females arrive after the nests are completed, coming in from deeper waters. The male then releases milt and the female releases eggs. Females may spawn in more than one nest, and more than one female may use the same nest. Also, more than one female will spawn with a male in one nest simultaneously. Females are able produce 1,500 to 1,700 eggs, depending on their size and age.

Once released, the eggs stick to gravel, sand, or other debris in the nest, and they hatch in as few as three days. Females leave the nest immediately after spawning, but males remain and guard their offspring. The male guards them for about the first 11 days, returning them to the nest in his mouth if they stray from the nesting site.

The young fish stay on or near the shallow breeding area and grow to about in their first year. Sexual maturity is usually achieved by age two. Pumpkinseeds have lived to be 12 years old in captivity, but in nature most do not exceed six to eight years old.

==Adaptations==

The pumpkinseed sunfish has adapted in many ways to the surroundings where it lives. Its skin reflects camouflage for its habitat. The pattern that appears on the pumpkinseed resembles that of the sunlight patterns that reflect on the shallow water of bays and river beds.

The pumpkinseed sunfish has developed a specific method of protection. Along the dorsal fin are 10 to 11 spines, and three additional spines on the anal fin. These spines are very sharp, which aid the fish in defense. The pumpkinseed has the ability to anticipate approaching predators (or prey) via a lateral line system, allowing it to detect changes or movements in the water using different mechanical receptors.

The brightly colored gill plates of the pumpkinseed sunfish also serve as a method of protection and dominance. Also known as an eye spot, the dark patch at the posterior of the gill plate provides the illusion that the eye of the fish is larger and positioned further back on the body, thus making the fish seem up to four times larger than it actually is. When a pumpkinseed feels threatened by a predator, it flares its gills to make it seem larger in size, and shows off the flashy red coloration. Males of the species also flare their gills in the spring spawning season in a show of dominance and territoriality.

In the southernmost regions of its distribution, the pumpkinseed has developed a larger mouth opening and abnormally large jaw muscles to aid in feeding; its forage is small crustaceans and mollusks. The larger bite radius and enhanced jaw muscles allow the pumpkinseed to crack the shells of their prey to attain the soft flesh within, thus providing one common name of &#x27;shellcracker&#x27;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Lepomis&quot;, in Greek, means &#x27;scaled gill cover&#x27; and &quot;&quot; means &#x27;humped&#x27;. The defining characteristic of a pumpkinseed sunfish is the bright red spot at the tip of the ear flap.

<text>Messier 78 or M78, also known as NGC 2068, is a reflection nebula in the constellation Orion. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1780 and included by Charles Messier in his catalog of comet-like objects that same year.

M78 is the brightest diffuse reflection nebula of a group of nebulae that includes NGC 2064, NGC 2067 and NGC 2071. This group belongs to the Orion B molecular cloud complex and is about distant from Earth. M78 is easily found in small telescopes as a hazy patch and involves two stars of 10th and 11th magnitude. These two B-type stars, and , are responsible for making the cloud of dust in M78 visible by reflecting their light.

The M78 cloud contains a cluster of stars that is visible in the infrared. Due to gravity, the molecular gas in the nebula has fragmented into a hierarchy of clumps, whose cores have masses ranging from to . About 45 variable stars of the &quot;T Tauri&quot; type, young stars still in the process of formation, are members as well. Similarly, 17 Herbig–Haro objects are known in M78.

On May 23, 2024, the European Space Agency released an initial set of images from their Euclid mission. This included an unprecedented image of the region including M78.
It showed hundreds of thousands of new objects including sub-stellar sized ones for the first time.

<doc id="967516" wikidata="Q3276876" url="?curid=967516" title="Magic Carpet Ride (Steppenwolf song)">
<text>&quot;Magic Carpet Ride&quot; is a rock song written by John Kay and Rushton Moreve from the Canadian-American hard rock band Steppenwolf. The song was initially released in 1968 on the album &quot;The Second&quot;. It was the lead single from that album, peaking at number three in the US, and staying in the charts for 16 weeks, longer than any other Steppenwolf song.

The 45 rpm version is not only an edit of the album version, but contains a different vocal take on the first verse. Despite the single&#x27;s popularity, the album version enjoyed heavy airplay on FM radio and is still the preferred version on most classic rock stations, as well as the one most commonly included on compilations and in popular media.

== Writing and recording ==
When preparing to record the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Second&quot;, bassist Rushton Moreve came up with a &quot;bouncy riff&quot;. Band member Jerry Edmonton&#x27;s brother, Mars Bonfire, started playing guitar, and the band developed the riff. For the introduction, guitarist Michael Monarch created feedback which was spliced on to the beginning of the band&#x27;s recording. John Kay had recently bought a new top-quality hi-fi system, and started writing lyrics &quot;about how great our new stereo system sounded,&quot; adding imagery about making a wish. After completing the lyrics and recording the vocal track, Kay overdubbed a falsetto, and sound engineer Bill Cooper spliced an extra chorus at the end of the track. While denying that the song was about drug experiences, Kay did admit to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2016 that &quot;I may have smoked a joint&quot; the night he and Monarch got the idea for the song. Kay also alleged the lyrics went beyond referencing the quality of the new stereo and were also a reference to his relationship with his wife Jutta and envisioning that he had made a wish with Aladdin&#x27;s lamp.

&quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as a &quot;pulsating rocker&quot; with similar sales potential to Steppenwolf&#x27;s earlier single, &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; predicted that &quot;the young set will flip for [the song].&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the song is played by the originator of warp flight, Zefram Cochrane, during launch sequences for good luck. Cochrane uses the song for any test flights and plays the song during the first warp flight, with the crew of the Enterprise, as featured in the movie &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

<text>Messier 79 (also known as M79 or NGC 1904) is a globular cluster in the southern constellation Lepus. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1780 and is about 42,000 light-years away from Earth and 60,000 light years from the Galactic Center.

Like Messier 54 (the other extragalactic globular on Messier&#x27;s list), it is believed to not be native to the Milky Way galaxy at all, but instead to the putative Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which is currently experiencing a very close encounter with our galaxy. This is, however, a contentious subject as astronomers are still debating the nature of the Canis Major dwarf galaxy itself. Messier 79 may also be part of the Gaia Sausage.

The cluster is being disrupted by the galactic tide, trailing a long tidal tail.

==Color-magnitude diagram==

This color-magnitude diagram was made using near-infrared images of the cluster in J and K bands. J-band magnitude is plotted along the y-axis and J to K dominant color is plotted along the x-axis. Such a diagram is made rapidly with specialized code for crowded-field photometry.

From this, it is evident that most of the bright stars in this cluster are red giants. The elongated branch is the red giant branch. Some of the stars in the diagram, including those extending outward from the red giant branch toward the upper left, are actually foreground stars that are not members of the cluster.

Altogether three regions of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram are present here: the low-mass end of the main sequence, the complete red giant branch and the horizontal branch. Compared to optical bands, in infrared bands the lower main sequence is shallower and the horizontal branch is steeper (the blue end is fainter and the red end is brighter).

<text>Dragonstar is a science fantasy game created by Fantasy Flight Games for Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s D20 role-playing game system.

==Setting==

The game&#x27;s setting is a galaxy under the dominion of the &quot;Dragon Empire&quot;. The &quot;Dragon Empire&quot; is an empire ruled by the ten houses of dragons. Of these houses, five are chromatic and five are metallic. The Empire is led by &quot;Mezzenbone&quot;, an evil red dragon.

Across the galaxy, fantasy races inhabit countless worlds. Scientists and archmages in the game try to come up with a logical explanation as to why the races had similar linguistic traits. Eventually, a prominent religious leader proposed a theory: all the gods of every religion were the same, just different aspects of the twelve &quot;True Gods&quot;. These aspects were the 12 &quot;Deitypes,&quot; short for Deity Archetypes. Deitypes are basic, primordial, archetypal icons such as The Father, The Mother, The Magus, The Smith, The Destroyer and The Trickster. Some deities have elements of two or more Deitypes. These 12 Deitypes seeded similarities all across the life-supporting worlds of the galaxy. This theory led to a new religion that formed the basis of an emerging unified interstellar culture. The dragons eventually rose to dominate and unite this culture under a single massive &quot;Dragon Empire&quot; that rules all of inhabited space. The dragons would assimilate newly discovered inhabited planets along the edge of the Empire, also known as the Outlands.

The &quot;Dragonstar&quot; setting can easily combine preexisting &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and other D20 material and settings. A PC group can be made up of character races and classes in any combination and be rationally integrated with little work. It is similar to the classic Spelljammer setting by TSR, although &quot;Dragonstar&quot; is more of a blend of science fantasy and space opera. A basic premise of the setting is that advanced technology is sufficient to handle most tasks, but things that are considered impossible by our current understanding of physics, such as faster-than-light travel between stars, force-fields, and teleportation, are accomplished with magic. Characters use a combination of technology, conventional weaponry and magic in combat.

==History==
The game was first announced on the Fantasy Flight website on December 5, 2001. The space opera science fantasy &quot;Dragonstar&quot; (2001) was the first d20 setting that Fantasy Flight Games published; FFG published several supplements for the setting between 2001-2003. Sometime between 2007 and 2008, the company decided to end support for the game. The game still has a fully functioning website with a support page and message boards.

==Reception==
In a review of &quot;Dragonstar&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, Tom Doolan said &quot;Perhaps one of the biggest strengths is the flexibility. A &quot;Dragonstar&quot; game can include traditional fantasy, space opera, hard science-fiction, horror, or any other adventure type you can think of (my own highly successful campaign was a blend of &quot;Firefly&quot; and &quot;D&amp;D&quot;).&quot;

==Publications==
The following products were published by Fantasy Flight games for the Dragonstar campaign setting:
*DS01 Starfarer&#x27;s Handbook ()
*DS02 Guide to the Galaxy ()
*DS03 Imperial Supply ()
*DS04 Player&#x27;s Companion ()
*DS05 Galactic Races ()

<text>Jan Jones Blackhurst (born Janis Lyle Laverty, later Jan Laverty Jones; March 16, 1949) is an American businesswoman and politician. She was mayor of Las Vegas, Nevada from 1991 to 1999 and the first woman to serve as mayor of Las Vegas. Jones Blackhurst is a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Jones Blackhurst was born in Los Angeles, California, raised in Santa Monica, and graduated from Stanford University in 1971. She became a recognized figure in Las Vegas in the 1980s, appearing as a spokeswoman in television commercials for her family&#x27;s supermarket chain, Thriftimart, and later a car dealership owned by her then-husband, Fletcher Jones Jr.

=== Politics ===
In 1990, Jones Blackhurst (known then as Jan Jones) ran for mayor of the City of Las Vegas; she was elected in 1991 and later re-elected in 1995, serving two four-year terms. During her time in office, Las Vegas&#x27; population grew significantly; Jones Blackhurst was credited for making the city &quot;more livable&quot; and directing attention towards social issues such as homelessness and LGBT rights.

While mayor of Las Vegas, Jones Blackhurst ran for Nevada governor twice, losing significantly in the 1994 Democratic primary to then-incumbent Bob Miller, and, after gaining the Democratic nomination in 1998, being defeated in the general election in 1998 by Kenny Guinn, the Republican nominee. In 1999, she chose not to run for a third term as mayor.

=== Post-politics ===
After leaving the office of mayor, Jones Blackhurst worked for Caesars Entertainment, later serving as Executive Vice President. In 2007, she was quoted by the UK newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; as saying Celine Dion&#x27;s husband and manager Rene Angelil gambled up to $1 million per week -- which she later retracted and apologized for, after actual figures were shown to indicate less ambitious stakes.

As of July 2021, Jones Blackhurst sits on the board of directors of several organizations: Caesars Entertainment, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, Sunrise Hospital, and the Las Vegas Stadium Authority, which owns Allegiant Stadium. She is also CEO-in-residence at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

==Personal life==
Jones Blackhurst is married to Dana Blackhurst, her second husband. They married in 2003, and Jones Blackhurst legally added the &quot;Blackhurst&quot; part of her surname in 2013. Jones Blackhurst has had six children.

Dana Blackhurst is an education advocate for learning disabilities who has headed several schools over the years, including Camperdown Academy (Greenville, South Carolina), Pine Ridge School (Williston, Vermont) and The Chandler School (also Greenville, South Carolina), which he founded. They live near the Red Rock Country Club in western Las Vegas.

== Honors ==
In 2017, the Clark County School District named a Las Vegas elementary school after Jones Blackhurst.

<text>Shlomo Ben-Ami (; born 17 July 1943) is a former Israeli diplomat, politician, and historian who participated in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, including the 2000 Camp David Summit.

==Biography==
Shlomo Benabou (later Ben-Ami) was born in Tangier, Morocco. He immigrated to Israel in 1955. He was educated at Tel Aviv University and St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford from which he received a D.Phil. in history. Ben-Ami speaks fluent Hebrew, Spanish, French, and English.

==Academic career==
He was a historian at Tel Aviv University from the mid-1970s, serving as head of the School of History from 1982 to 1986. His initial field of study was Spanish history; his 1983 biography of the former Spanish dictator (1923–30), General Primo de Rivera, is recognized as the most authoritative study on this subject. He later turned his attention to the history of Israel and the Middle East, leaving a legacy of expertise in Spanish interwar politics.

==Diplomatic and political career==
From 1987 until 1991, before he entered politics, he was the Israeli ambassador to Spain. In 1996 he was elected to the Knesset on Labour&#x27;s list.

When the One Israel-led government of Ehud Barak took office in July 1999, Ben-Ami became the Minister of Internal Security, responsible for the Israel Police. In August 2000, when David Levy resigned as Foreign Minister during talks with Palestinian leaders in the United States, Barak designated Ben-Ami to be the acting Foreign Minister and he was officially appointed to the role in November 2000.

Ben-Ami remained Foreign Minister and Security Minister until March 2001, when, having won elections, Ariel Sharon took over from Barak. Ben-Ami refused to serve in the Sharon government and resigned from the Knesset in August 2002.

In their report published in 2003, the Or Commission held him responsible for the behavior of security forces during the October 2000 riots in which Israeli police killed 12 Israeli Arabs and one Palestinian, and failed to predict and control rioting which resulted in the death of a Jewish Israeli. The report recommended that Ben-Ami be disqualified from serving as Internal Security Minister in the future. Despite the disqualification, Ben-Ami was not considered to be a hard-liner in Israeli relations with the Palestinians and during his time in the Barak government, he was a political rival of Shimon Peres.

Ben-Ami is currently Vice-President of the Toledo International Centre for Peace (TICpax), which, according to its mission statement, &quot;seeks to contribute to the prevention and resolution of violent or potentially violent international or intranational conflicts and to the consolidation of peace, within a framework of respect and promotion of Human Rights and democratic values.&quot;

Ben-Ami is the author of &quot;Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli–Arab Tragedy&quot; (Oxford, 2006), which challenges many of the founding myths in Israel&#x27;s modern history especially related to the war of independence. His latest book is &quot;Prophets without Honor: The 2000 Camp David Summit and the End of the Two-State Solution&quot; (Oxford, 2022).
Ben-Ami backed the Meretz party for the 2009 Knesset elections.

==Later career==
He currently serves as vice president of the Toledo International Centre for Peace of which he is a co-founder.
Through the center, he has been involved in conflict resolution processes such as among others, in Colombia, Dominican Republic ( the tensions with Haiti ), Bolivia ( intercultural issues ), Russia-Georgia, Libya ; Spanish Sahara, and Israel-the Arab world. 
He is now also the co-chair ( together with ex-chief of Mossad Efraim Halevi ) of an Israeli commission for strategic planning.
He has lectured extensively in international conferences in Europe, Russia, the U.S. and Latin America. He is a regular contributor to Project Syndicate since 2006.

== Interviews ==
In an interview on Democracy Now!, Ben-Ami described how his perspective differs from that of the New Historians:My view is that, but for Jesus Christ, everybody was born in sin, including nations. And the moral perspective of it is there, but at the same time it does not undermine, in my view, in my very modest view, the justification for the creation of a Jewish state, however tough the conditions and however immoral the consequences were for the Palestinians. You see, it is there that I tend to differ from the interpretation of the new historians. They have made an incredible contribution, a very, very important contribution to our understanding of the origins of the state of Israel, but at the same time, my view is that this is how — unfortunately, tragically, sadly — nations were born throughout history.He goes on to describe his perspective on the goal of the peace process and its outcome:And our role, the role of this generation—this is why I came into politics and why I try to make my very modest contribution to the peace process—is that we need to bring an end to this injustice that has been done to the Palestinians. We need to draw a line between an Israeli state, a sovereign Palestinian state, and solve the best way we can the problem, by giving the necessary compensation to the refugees, by bringing back the refugees to the Palestinian state, no way to the state of Israel, not because it is immoral, but because it is not feasible, it is not possible. We need to act in a realistic way and see what are the conditions for a final peace deal. I believe that we came very, very close to that final peace deal. Unfortunately, we didn&#x27;t make it. But we came very close in the year 2001.

<doc id="967558" wikidata="Q10259870" url="?curid=967558" title="Grand Prix of Long Beach">
<text>The Grand Prix of Long Beach (known as Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach since 2019 for naming rights reasons) is an IndyCar Series race held on a street circuit in downtown Long Beach, California. It was the premier race on the CART/Champ Car World Series calendar from 1996 to 2008, and the 2008 race was the final Champ Car series race prior to the formal unification and end of the open-wheel &quot;split&quot; between CART and IRL. Since 2009, the race has been part of the unified IndyCar Series. The race is typically held in April. It is the second-oldest continuously running event in IndyCar racing behind only the Indianapolis 500, and is considered one of the most prestigious events on the circuit.

The Long Beach Grand Prix is the longest running major street race held in North America. It was started in 1975 as a Formula 5000 race by event founder Christopher Pook, and became a Formula One event in . In an era when turbocharged engines were starting to come to prominence in Formula One, Long Beach remains one of the few circuits used from the time Renault introduced turbos in until the last Long Beach Grand Prix in 1983 that never once saw a turbo-powered car take victory.

John Watson&#x27;s win for McLaren in 1983 holds the Formula One record for the lowest ever starting position for a race winner. In a grid consisting of 26 cars, Watson started 22nd in his McLaren-Ford. That same race also saw Watson&#x27;s teammate (and 1982 Long Beach winner) Niki Lauda finish second after starting 23rd on the grid. René Arnoux, who finished third in his Ferrari 126C2B, was the only driver to ever finish on the Formula One podium at Long Beach driving a turbocharged car.

In 1984, the race switched from a Formula One race to a CART IndyCar event. Support races over the years have included Indy Lights, IMSA, Atlantics, Pirelli World Challenge, Trans-Am Series, Formula D, Stadium Super Trucks, Formula E, and the Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race. Toyota was a sponsor of the event since its beginning and title sponsor from 1980 to 2018, believed to be the longest continuously running sports sponsorship in the U.S.

The Long Beach Grand Prix has been announced since 1978 by Bruce Flanders (and various guest announcers). The Long Beach Grand Prix in April is the single largest event in the city of Long Beach. Attendance for the weekend regularly reaches or exceeds 200,000 people. In 2006, the Long Beach Motorsports Walk of Fame was created to honor selected past winners and key contributors to the sport of auto racing.

==Event history==
The Long Beach Grand Prix was the brainchild of promoter Chris Pook, a former travel agent from England. Pook was inspired by the Monaco Grand Prix, and believed that a similar event had the potential to succeed in the Southern California area. The city of Long Beach was selected, approximately south of downtown Los Angeles. A waterfront circuit, near the Port of Long Beach was laid out on city streets, and despite the area at the time being mostly a depressed, industrial port city, the first event drew 30,000 fans. The inaugural race was held in September 1975 as part of the Formula 5000 series.

In 1976, the United States Grand Prix West was created, providing two grand prix races annually in the United States for a time. Long Beach became a Formula One event for 1976 and the race was moved to March or April. Meanwhile, the United States Grand Prix East at Watkins Glen International was experiencing a noticeably steady decline. Despite gaining a reputation of being demanding and rough on equipment, Long Beach almost immediately gained prominence owing much to its pleasant weather, picturesque setting, and close proximity to Los Angeles and the glitzy Hollywood area. When Watkins Glen was dropped from the Formula One calendar after 1980, the now-established Long Beach began to assume an even more prominent status.

Despite exciting races and strong attendance, the event was not financially successful as a Formula One event. The promoter was risking a meager $100,000 profit against a $6–7 million budget. Fearing that one poor running could bankrupt the event, Pook convinced city leaders to change the race to a Championship Auto Racing Teams IndyCar event beginning in 1984. In short time, the event grew to prominence on the IndyCar circuit and has been credited with triggering a renaissance in the city of Long Beach. The race was used to market the city, and in the years since the race&#x27;s inception, many dilapidated and condemned buildings have been replaced with high-rise hotels and tourist attractions.

The event served as a CART/Champ Car race from 1984 to 2008, then became an IndyCar Series race event in 2009. The 2017 race was the 43rd running, and the 34th consecutive as an IndyCar race, one of the longest continuously running events in the history of American championship car racing. On three occasions (1984, 1985 and 1987) the race served as the CART season opener. In seven separate seasons (1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993 and 1994), it served as the final race before the Indianapolis 500.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 race was canceled as part of the City of Long Beach&#x27;s ban on events with estimated attendance of more than 250. The following year, as a preparatory measure for the pandemic&#x27;s effects on the schedule, the race was moved from its traditional April date to September 26 as the season finale. With the rise of the Delta variant there were concerns from IndyCar and the event promoters that the race would have to be canceled for 2021 or run with an attendance cap, but the promoters and the city of Long Beach were able to work out a compromise on safety measures and rapid testing to allow the event to go forward with full capacity.

The Grand Prix returned to its traditional April date for the 2022 IndyCar Series.

On March 28, 2024, it was announced that former ChampCar owner Gerald Forsythe would buy a 50% stake in the Long Beach Grand Prix from the estate of the late Kevin Kalkhoven.

===First wins===
Despite the challenging nature of the course, the Grand Prix of Long Beach has produced the first Indy/Champ Car victories for several drivers. Drivers who won their first career Indy car race at Long Beach include Michael Andretti, Paul Tracy, Juan Pablo Montoya, Mike Conway, Takuma Sato, and Kyle Kirkwood. For Michael Andretti, the Long Beach Grand Prix has the distinction of being his first career Indy car win (1986), and 42nd and final career IndyCar win (2002).

James Hinchcliffe won his first-career Indy Lights race at Long Beach in 2010, then followed it up with an IndyCar Series win at the track in 2017. In 2005, Katherine Legge won the Atlantic Championship support race at Long Beach, her first start in the series. In doing so, she became the first female driver to win a developmental open-wheel race in North America.

==Circuit==
The current race circuit is a temporary road course laid out in the city streets surrounding the Long Beach Convention Center. The convention center actually doubled as the pit paddock during the days of Formula One. The circuit also goes primarily over the former location of The Pike historic amusement zone. The track is particularly noted for its last section, a sharp hairpin turn followed by a long, slightly curved front straightaway which runs the length of Shoreline Drive. The circuit is situated on the Long Beach waterfront, and is lined with palm trees (especially along the front straightaway towards the Aquarium of the Pacific), making for a scenic track. Long Beach is classified as an FIA Grade Two circuit.

The circuit has undergone numerous layout changes since the race&#x27;s inception in 1975. All iterations have featured a signature hairpin turn, main stretch along Shoreline Drive, and back stretch along Seaside Way or Ocean Boulevard. The first grand prix layout measured 2.02 miles, and featured two hairpins, one at each end of the Shoreline Drive straightaway. In its early years, the starting line and the finish line were located on different sides of the course.

In 1982, the hairpin turn and the end of the main stretch (turn 1) was removed, and replaced with a 90-degree right turn, followed by 90-degree left turn. When the race became a CART series event, the layout was changed significantly. The final turn hairpin was moved to the east, closer to the pit entrance. Other slow chicanes and turns were removed. After a minor tweak to the layout in 1987, the track was shortened in 1992 by the removal of the Park Avenue loop. That created a longer Seaside Way back stretch and a faster run to the passing zone.

In 1999, due to new construction in the area, the turn one set of curves was removed, and replaced with the new fountain complex. Turn one now became a 90-degree left turn, leading into a roundabout around a fountain, and a series of three 90-degree turns. A year later, this segment was revised again, to create a longer straightaway leading to Pine Avenue. This course layout remains intact today.

==Events==
===Formula 5000 and Formula One===

The inaugural race was held as part of the Formula 5000 series. From 1976 to 1983 the event was a Formula One race, commonly known as the United States Grand Prix West.

The City of Long Beach and the Grand Prix Association signed a contract in 2014 to hold the Grand Prix as part of the IndyCar Series through 2018, with optional extensions available through 2020. In 2016, the Long Beach City Council issued an RFP, opening up consideration for returning the event to a Formula One race as early as 2019. In August 2017, after a study was completed and after discussions, the switch to Formula One was rejected. The city council voted unanimously to continue the event as part of the IndyCar Series.

===2008 Long Beach/Motegi &quot;split weekend&quot;===

During negotiations which led to the unification of the Champ Car World Series and the IRL IndyCar Series in 2008, a scheduling conflict arose between the IndyCar race held at Twin Ring Motegi (April 19) and the Champ Car race at Long Beach (April 20). Neither party was able to reschedule their event.

A compromise was made to create a unique &quot;split weekend&quot; of races at Motegi and Long Beach. The existing Indy Racing League teams would compete in Japan, while the ex-Champ Car teams raced at Long Beach. Both races paid equal points towards the 2008 IndyCar Series championship. The ex-Champ Car teams utilized the Panoz DP01 machines, the cars that would have been used in 2008 had the unification not taken place. The 2008 Long Beach Grand Prix was billed as the &quot;final Champ Car race.&quot;

===Drifting===
Beginning in 2005 the event included a demonstration by participants in the Formula D drifting series. Since 2006 Formula D has held the first round of their pro series on Turns 9–11 on the weekend prior to the Grand Prix. In 2013 the Motegi Super Drift Challenge, a drifting competition, was added on the GP weekend, using the same Turn 9–11 course as Formula D. The Motegi Super Drift Challenge is the only event during the GP that runs at night, under floodlights.

===North American Touring Car Championship===
Long Beach hosted the opening round of the 1997 North American Touring Car Championship, being won by Neil Crompton in a Honda Accord.

===Formula E===

A modified version of the Long Beach Grand Prix track was used during the Long Beach ePrix of the FIA Formula E Championship. The track is 2.1 km (1.3 mi) in length and features seven turns. Admission to the first event was free: &quot;the free admission will afford everyone the opportunity to come out and witness this historic and unique event&quot;, Jim Michaelian, president of the Grand Prix Assn. of Long Beach, said in a statement. The ePrix was held once again in 2016. However, it was not renewed for the third Formula E season in 2017.

==Race summaries==
===CART PPG Indy Car World Series===
*1984: After eight years, the Long Beach Grand Prix changed to a CART series race. The race served as the 1984 season opener. Mario Andretti, who won the 1977 race, won the pole position, took the lead at the start and led all 112 laps en route to a dominating victory. The only other driver to finish the race on the lead lap was Geoff Brabham, who finished second on only seven cylinders. Two-time World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi made his CART debut with a 4th-place finish.
*1985: Mario Andretti started on the pole position, and led the first 58 laps. Andretti&#x27;s strategy was to try to complete the race on one pit stop. After building up an over 10-second lead, Andretti pitted on lap 44. In order to conserve fuel, however, he subsequently dialed back his turbocharger boost. Danny Sullivan had pitted on lap 37. With Andretti slowing his pace, Sullivan went on a charge, dicing through traffic and caught up to Andretti. On the back stretch on lap 59, Sullivan took the lead and began pulling out to a 15-second advantage. It was expected that the race would be decided between Sullivan and Andretti, with Sullivan needing one final pit stop, and Andretti gambling on going the distance. The Penske Team was planning a timed pit stop for Sullivan, hoping to fuel the car, and get back out on the track in close proximity to Andretti. On lap 79, Sullivan shockingly ran out of fuel coming out of the hairpin, and he coasted into the pits barely under power. Sullivan lost many seconds, allowing Andretti to re-take the lead. Andretti led the rest of the way and won at Long Beach for the second year in a row, and third time overall. Sullivan ran out of fuel again on the last lap, and wound up third.
*1986: Michael Andretti scored the first win of his CART career, battling Al Unser Jr. to the finish over a frantic final 25 laps. Michael Andretti made his final pit stop on lap 56, while Al Unser Jr. pitted on lap 69. Unser came out of the pits just ahead of Andretti, but on cold tires, had difficulties holding off the challenge. Down the back stretch on lap 70, Andretti got by and re-assumed the lead. Unser stayed in close contact with Andretti, and on lap 80 when Andretti came upon the lapped car of Roberto Moreno, Unser closed dramatically. Andretti tried to lap Moreno at the end of the back stretch (turn 11), but the two cars nearly clipped wheels and Andretti locked up the brakes. Unser dove below both cars and went side by side with Andretti going into turn 12. Andretti barely held off Unser going into the hairpin. The cars battled nearly nose-to-tail to the finish, with Andretti winning the race by 0.380 seconds.
*1987: Mario Andretti started on the pole position and led all 95 laps, en route to his third CART win at Long Beach, and fourth win overall. Andretti&#x27;s victory marked the first-ever Indy car win for the Ilmor–Chevy Indy V-8 engine. Mario Andretti&#x27;s only serious challenge was from Emerson Fittipaldi. The drivers pulled away from the field and dominated the first half. Fittipaldi, however, suffered from a broken wastegate, and eventually dropped out with a burned piston on lap 52. Andretti cruised the rest of the way, lapping the field. For the third year in a row, Bobby Rahal dropped out early after contact with the concrete wall.
*1988: Al Unser Jr. snapped the Andretti family winning streak at Long Beach, winning the race for the first time, in dominating fashion. Unser Jr. started fourth, but at the start, settled into second behind Mario Andretti. Going into the hairpin at the end of the first lap, Unser dove below Andretti and took the lead. On his first pit stop, Unser suffered a cross-threaded lug nut, and dropped to sixth, putting Danny Sullivan into the lead. Unser charged, however, gaining nearly a second per lap, re-taking the lead for good on lap 42. Unser led 72 of the 95 laps, lapping the entire field, and when Sullivan dropped out on lap 82, was all alone to the finish. Bobby Rahal finished second, his best career Long Beach result, driving the Judd AV engine.
*1989: Al Unser Jr. led 72 of the first 74 laps, but late in the race, Unser found himself in a battle with Mario and Michael Andretti. All three drivers made their final pit stops, and after a faster pit stop, Mario Andretti emerged as the leader on lap 78, with Unser second, and Michael now a distant third. Unser was close behind Mario when they approached the lapped car of Tom Sneva. At the exit of turn two, and going into turn three, Unser dove under Mario Andretti for the lead, but punted Mario&#x27;s right-rear wheel. Andretti was sent spinning out with a flat tire and broken suspension, while Unser broke part of his front wing, and bent his steering. Despite the damage, Unser nursed the crippled car to the finish line, winning by 12.377 seconds over Michael Andretti. The contact was controversial, and after the race, Mario called the move &quot;stupid driving.&quot; Unser accepted blame for the contact.
*1990: Al Unser Jr. led 91 of 95 laps, but late in the race, had to hold off the challenge of Penske teammates Emerson Fittipaldi and Danny Sullivan for the victory. On lap 2, Fittipaldi and Sullivan banged wheels, causing Sullivan to spin and collect Michael Andretti. Both Sullivan and Andretti recovered and charged up through the field as the race went progressed. With Unser Jr. holding a 10-second lead, a caution came out on lap 66 which bunched the field and erased Unser&#x27;s advantage. All of the leaders pitted, and when the green flag came back out on lap 70, Fittipaldi was able to close up behind Unser. Fittipaldi got within two car lengths, but Unser held on for the victory. After the early altercation, Danny Sullivan and Michael Andretti finished 3rd and 4th. It was Al Unser Jr.&#x27;s third consecutive win at Long Beach.
*1991: Al Unser Jr. set an event record and tied a CART series record, by winning the Long Beach Grand Prix for the fourth year in a row. The race, however, is best-remembered for a frightening pit road collision between Michael Andretti and Emerson Fittipaldi. Michael Andretti started on the pole and led the first lap, but Al Unser Jr. took the lead on lap 2. Unser stretched his lead to as large as 16 seconds, while Andretti ran second much of the afternoon. On lap 70, Unser and Andretti made their final pit stops. Unser returned to the track with the lead. While Andretti was exiting the pit lane, Emerson Fittipaldi came out of his pit stall in the path of Andretti. The two cars touched wheels, Andretti&#x27;s car flew up on its side, then came to rest on top of Fittipaldi&#x27;s sidepod. The two cars were too damaged to return, but neither driver was injured. After the pit road mishap, Unser cruised to victory, with his Galles/KRACO Racing teammate Bobby Rahal coming home second.

*1992: Going for an unprecedented fifth win in a row at Long Beach, Al Unser Jr. lead 54 laps, and was leading with less than four laps to go. His Galles/KRACO Racing teammate Danny Sullivan was right behind in second, challenging for the lead in the closing laps. Bobby Rahal and Emerson Fittipaldi were also nose-to-tail with the leaders. Going down the back stretch on lap 102, Sullivan dove low to make the pass, but Unser closed the door. The two cars tangled, and Unser was sent spinning out into a tire barrier. Sullivan took the lead, and staved off Rahal and Fittpaldi to the finish line. It was the first ever win for the Galmer chassis, and Sullivan&#x27;s first Indy car win since 1990. Unser Jr. recovered from the spin, and finished in 4th place. The race started out on the first lap with a collision between Mario Andretti and Eddie Cheever, which started a standing feud between the two.
*1993: Paul Tracy won his first career Indy car race, battling Nigel Mansell most of the afternoon. Tracy led 81 of the 105 laps, but his day was not without incident. While leading the race on lap 25, he clipped wheels with Danny Sullivan, and was forced to pit with a flat tire. Later on lap 61, he had to make an unscheduled pit stop for a blistered tire. Tracy re-assumed the lead on lap 74 after Mansell made his final pit stop, and when Mansell later lost second gear, Tracy cruised to the finish. Bobby Rahal, running 11th at the halfway point, finished 2nd in the RH chassis, owing much to the fact that Mansell, Scott Goodyear, Mario Andretti, Raul Boesel all suffered contact or mechanical problems late in the race.
*1994: Al Unser Jr., who had joined Team Penske during the offseason, won his first race driving for his new team, and his record fifth victory at Long Beach. Penske teammates Paul Tracy, Unser, and Emerson Fittipaldi started 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, respectively, and combined to lead all but two laps. Tracy and Fittipaldi led early, but both eventually dropped out with gearbox failures. Tracy spun four times due to the axle-hopping from the gearbox issues, including spinning out while leading the race on lap 20. Unser led 61 laps, and despite a black flag penalty for violating the pit road speed limit, won the race going away. Nigel Mansell finished second, but had lost considerable time when he and Michael Andretti made contact, resulting in a flat tire.
*1995: Al Unser Jr. started fourth, and charged to the lead by lap 30. Unser dominated most of the rest of the race, and won his sixth Long Beach Grand Prix in the past eight years. Scott Pruett finished second for Patrick Racing, the best finish for Firestone tires since returning to Indy car racing at the beginning of the season. Contenders Bobby Rahal (transmission), Christian Fittipaldi (engine), and Teo Fabi (stop-and-go penalty) all fell from contention in the latter stages of the race.
*1996: Gil de Ferran won the pole position and dominated the race, leading 100 of the first 101 laps. With four laps to go, however, a turbocharger hose came loose, and de Ferrans&#x27;s car suddenly began to slow. Jimmy Vasser led the final four laps, holding off Parker Johnstone for the victory.
*1997: Gil de Ferran and Alex Zanardi started on the front row, and battled much of the afternoon. Though de Ferran appeared to have the faster machine, Zanardi&#x27;s Ganassi crew executed faster pit stops, which put Zanardi out in front after each sequences of stops. Charging hard to catch Zanardi, de Ferran clipped the wall on lap 93, and fell out with a damaged suspension.

===CART FedEx Championship Series===
*1998: Alex Zanardi scored an improbable victory, winning at Long Beach for the second year in a row. Zanardi fell a lap down early in the race after a collision resulted in a bent steering arm. The race lead was being contested between Bryan Herta, Gil de Ferran, Dario Franchitti, and Hélio Castroneves. With a race-record seven cautions, Zanardi managed to get back on the lead lap and slowly worked his way up through the field. On lap 72, Zanardi pitted for tires and fuel, while most of the leaders stayed out since they had just pitted on lap 56. In the closing stages, all of the leaders except Zanardi were facing a splash-and-go pit stop for fuel. After the leaders cycled through their stops, Herta and Frachitti emerged 1st-2nd, with Zanardi now in third, and charging hard. With five laps to go, the top three were nose-to-tail, and Zanardi passed for second. Three laps later, he took the lead. Zanardi led only the final two laps to steal the win.
*1999: Rookie Juan Pablo Montoya won his first-career Champ/Indy car race, in his third career start, giving Chip Ganassi Racing the team&#x27;s fourth consecutive victory at Long Beach, in front of a record crowd of 102,000. Montoya started the race fifth, and one by one, picked off the top three cars to move into second behind race leader Tony Kanaan. On lap 46, due to the track breaking up, Kanaan lost control and slid off the course and into a tire barrier. The crash handed the lead to Montoya, who led the rest of the way to victory.
*2000: Paul Tracy started 17th, but steadily climbed to the front of the field, taking the lead on lap 62 to win at Long Beach for the second time. Tracy benefited from strong pit strategy, swift pit work, and an aggressive charge, and managed to put himself in third on lap 58. On a restart with rookie Takuya Kurosawa leading, Roberto Moreno second, and Tracy third, Moreno suddenly slowed with gearbox trouble. Tracy muscled past Kurosawa four laps later, and held off Hélio Castroneves for the victory.
*2001: Hélio Castroneves started from the pole position and led all 82 lap to victory. Despite leading wire-to-wire, Castroneves did not run away with the race, with Cristiano da Matta and Kenny Bräck in close pursuit most of the day. After Brack dropped out with a broken gearbox on lap 30, the race was a two-man battle between Castroneves and da Matta. Castroneves staved off numerous overtake attempts by da Matta in the second half. The margin of victory was a mere 0.534 seconds, one of the closest finishes in Long Beach history.
*2002: Michael Andretti won the 2002 Grand Prix of Long Beach, his 42nd and final career Indy/Champ car victory. The win came nearly sixteen years to the day of his first career Indy car win – at the same race – the 1986 Long Beach Grand Prix. Andretti started 15th and gambled by pitting out-of-sequence, as did Max Papis. Andretti assumed the lead on lap 62 when the rest of the leaders cycled through routine green flag pit stops. Andretti and Papis led Jimmy Vasser by over 30 seconds, but both still needed one final pit stop for fuel. A full-course caution came out on lap 63, and both drivers took advantage of the break. Meanwhile, Vasser slowed down to be picked up by the pace car, not realizing he was not the race leader, and actually running third. Vasser slowing down gave Andretti and Papis extra time and allowed them to pit without giving up first and second position. Vasser managed to get by Papis when the green came back out, but Andretti held on for the win.
*2003: Michel Jourdain Jr. looked poised to win his first-career CART series race, but mechanical problems foiled his chances at victory. Jourdain started on the pole, but Paul Tracy took the lead at the start and led the first 26 laps. After pit stops, Jourdain assumed the lead on lap 27, and mostly dominated the race over the next 49 laps. The race came down to Jourdain and Tracy, with both drivers needing one final pit stop in the final ten laps. Tracy pitted with 8 laps to go, and came back out on the track still in second place, ahead of Adrián Fernández. Jourdain pitted one lap later, but as he was leaving the pits, the car failed to pull away. A faulty clutch dropped him out of the race, and handed the victory to Tracy. It was Tracy&#x27;s third win at Long Beach, and he became the first driver in CART history to sweep the first three races of the season.

===Champ Car World Series===

*2004: Paul Tracy won the 30th Long Beach Grand Prix, his fourth victory in the event, and second in a row. At the start, Tracy utilized the new Push-to-pass button to boldly dive from third to first in the first turn. Tracy ran away with the race, giving up the lead only once during a routine pit stop. On lap 2, three cars (Jimmy Vasser, Alex Sperafico, and Tarso Marques) crashed, bringing out the lone caution of the day.
*2005: Sébastien Bourdais worked his way from fourth starting position to the lead by lap 30. Bourdais pulled out to as much as a 7-second lead, and controlled the race most of the way thereafter. A late caution bunched the field, and second place Paul Tracy was on the optional tires, while Bourdais was on the primary tires. Bourdais got the jump on the restart and went on to win, while Tracy became mired behind a lapped car and finished second. The race was held under a cloud of uncertainty, as it was in its final contract year with CART/Champ Car. Rumors were swirling around the paddock that the event might switch to the Indy Racing League for 2006.
*2006: After rumors of a possible switch to IRL, the race returned as part of the Champ Car series. Sébastien Bourdais won for the second year in a row, starting from the pole and leading 70 of the 74 laps. He finished 14 seconds ahead of second place Justin Wilson.
*2007: Sébastien Bourdais led 58 of 78 laps, dominating en route to his third consecutive Long Beach victory. Paul Tracy crashed during practice on Saturday and sat out with a back injury. He was replaced by Oriol Servia. Will Power passed Alex Tagliani on the last lap to finish second.
*2008: The 2008 Long Beach Grand Prix was the first to take place after the open wheel unification, and it considered the final race of the Champ Car era. After the IndyCar and Champ Car calendars were hastily merged, an irreconcilable scheduling conflict arose between Long Beach and the Indy Japan 300. A compromise was made such that the former Champ Car teams competed at Long Beach, while established IndyCar Series teams competed at Motegi. Both races would pay full points to the IndyCar championship, and while Long Beach technically now fell under the sanctioning umbrella of IndyCar, it was run with Champ Car regulations, and was heralded as the &quot;final&quot; Champ Car race. The contingent of former Champ Car teams produced a twenty-car field, all utilizing the turbocharged Cosworth/Panoz DP01 for the final time. From a standing start (the first such at Long Beach since 1983), Will Power got the jump from fourth position to take the lead into turn one. Power led 81 of the 83 laps, relinquishing the top position only during pit stops.

===IndyCar Series===
*2009: Will Power took the lead from the pole position and led the first 16 laps. Dario Franchitti and Danica Patrick both pitted early on lap 16, and benefited from a full-course caution. Over the next 30 laps, the lead traded between Tony Kanaan, Marco Andretti, and Dario Franchitti. Pitting early once more, Dario Franchitti and Danica Patrick again benefited. Moments later, Mike Conway spun into the tire barrier in turn 8, bringing out the full course caution again. Most of the leaders pit under the yellow, while Franchitti stayed out to take the lead. Franchitti pulled away and held the lead to the finish, taking the victory. It was his first IndyCar win since 2007, having spent 2008 racing in NASCAR.
*2010: Will Power starting on the pole position, and led the race early. On lap 17, Power errored, when he inadvertently hit the pit road speed limiter button. Ryan Hunter-Reay and Justin Wilson slipped by and Power dropped to third. On a restart on lap 65, Hunter-Reay led, with Power second, and Wilson third. Hunter-Reay had lapped traffic between him and Power and was able to pull out to a comfortable lead. Power, struggling to get through traffic, was passed by Wilson for second. Wilson was not able to close the gap, and Hunter-Reay drove on to victory.
*2011: With less than 20 laps to go, Mike Conway charged into third place on a restart. He quickly powered past Dario Franchitti and Will Power to take the lead. Conway pulled out to a six-second advantage, and led the final 14 laps en route to his first Indy car victory.
*2012: Just days prior to the race, Chevrolet announced that all eleven of their entries would change engines, in violation of IndyCar&#x27;s mileage requirement rule. As a penalty, all of the Chevrolet entries would incur a 10-position grid penalty after time trials. At the start, Dario Franchitti and rookie Josef Newgarden battled into turn one. Newgarden tried to take the lead on the outside, but the two cars clipped slightly, and Newgarden smacked the tire barrier and crashed out of the race. Franchitti took the lead for the first four laps, but quickly faded with handling problems. The race became a contest between rookie Simon Pagenaud and Will Power, with Takuma Sato also strong all afternoon. Power made his final pit stop on lap 64, and attempted to stretch his fuel over the final 21 laps. Pagenaud pitted on lap 70, and seemingly had plenty of fuel to charge to the finish. As Power held the lead, Pagenaud dramatically charged to catch Power, gaining 1–2 seconds per lap. The cars were nose-to-tail in the hairpin as they approached the white flag. Power held off on the final lap to win by 0.8 seconds. Despite the grid penalties, Chevrolet-powered cars swept eight of the top ten finishing positions.
*2013: Takuma Sato led 50 of 80 laps, and won his first career IndyCar race. Sato effectively took control of the race on lap 23, when he passed Ryan Hunter-Reay for second place in turn 1. After the leaders cycled through pit stops, Sato assumed the lead on lap 31, and did not relinquish the top spot for the remainder of the race. Sato&#x27;s win was the first for A. J. Foyt Enterprises since 2002.
*2014: On lap 56, a controversial crash took out six cars, including the drivers running 1st–2nd–3rd. During a sequence of green flag pit stops, Josef Newgarden inherited the lead. Ryan Hunter-Reay, James Hinchcliffe, and Will Power were running nose-to-tail in 2nd–3rd–4th. Newgarden completed his pit stop, and came out on the track just ahead of Hunter-Reay, momentarily holding on to the lead. Going into turn 4, Hunter-Reay attempted a risky pass for the lead, and he made contact with Newgarden, sending both cars into the wall. Hinchcliffe was collected, as was three other cars in the huge melee that nearly blocked the track. Late in the race, Scott Dixon led, followed by Mike Conway and Power close behind. Dixon ran out of fuel, and had to pit with two laps to go. Conway held off Power and Carlos Muñoz to win for the second time at Long Beach.
*2015: During the first sequence of green flag pit stops on lap 29, leader Hélio Castroneves was briefly held in his pit box to avoid collision with Tony Kanaan, who was entering the stall just ahead. The delay cost Castroneves valuable track position, and allowed Scott Dixon to take over the lead. During the second round of pit stops on lap 55, Dixon was narrowly able to hold the lead, and cruised to victory, his first career win at Long Beach. With Dixon comfortably out in front, and Castroneves in second, the closing laps focused on a furious four-car battle for third place, led by Juan Pablo Montoya and Simon Pagenaud. Fifth place went to Tony Kanaan.
*2016: Hélio Castroneves led 49 of the first 51 laps. During the second round of stops, Scott Dixon was able to pass Castroneves with quick pit work. However, Simon Pagenaud&#x27;s pit stop was even faster, and he emerged with the lead of the race. Controversy followed, as Pagenaud placed two tires over the blend line at the exit of pit lane while trying to beat Dixon to turn one. IndyCar officials let Pagenaud off with a warning for the incident, despite protests from Chip Ganassi Racing. Pagenaud held off Dixon by 0.3032 seconds, the closest finish in Long Beach history.
*2017: James Hinchcliffe won for the first time since his serious crash during practice at the 2015 Indianapolis 500. In the late stages of the race, Andretti Autosport teammates Alexander Rossi, Takuma Sato, and Ryan Hunter-Reay all dropped out with mechanical problems, leaving Hinchcliffe to battle Sébastien Bourdais and Josef Newgarden to the finish. On a restart with three laps to go, Hinchcliffe got the jump and held on for the victory.
*2021: The new Roger Penske-led IndyCar Series returned to Long Beach in 2021 after the 2020 event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was moved from the traditional early season slot in April to the season finale on September 26 due to the ongoing pandemic. The race was a championship-deciding showdown between three drivers; Alex Palou of Chip Ganassi Racing, Pato O&#x27;Ward of Arrow McLaren SP, and Josef Newgarden of Team Penske. Palou held a 35-point advantage over his rivals, meaning he only had to finish no worse than 11th to win the championship. O&#x27;Ward and Newgarden both had to qualify on the pole to earn the awarded bonus point and win the race to put themselves in a position to win the championship. If he met those prerequisites, O&#x27;Ward needed Palou to finish no better than thirteenth to win the championship. Newgarden needed to meet those prerequisites and for Palou to finish no better than twentieth and O&#x27;Ward to finish no better than third to win the championship. Qualifying for the race was highly controversial due to a yellow flag caused by Will Power that prevented both Palou and O&#x27;Ward from advancing into the Firestone Fast Six while Newgarden advanced. Newgarden won his season-leading fourth pole position and first ever at Long Beach while Palou qualified tenth and O&#x27;Ward eighth. Further controversy erupted in a first lap pile up when Ed Jones ran into the back of O&#x27;Ward and broke a driveshaft on O&#x27;Ward&#x27;s car. The incident knocked O&#x27;Ward out of the race and the championship battle. Meanwhile Colton Herta mounted a furious charge to the front of the field from fourteenth and overtook Scott Dixon and Newgarden for the lead on lap 31 en route to his third win of the season. Palou drove a conservative race into fourth place to secure his first IndyCar championship. Newgarden and Dixon finished second and third respectively.
*2022: Long Beach returned to its traditional early season slot for 2022. Colton Herta took pole position and led the early stint of the race before Josef Newgarden and Alex Palou overcut Herta in the first series of pitstops. Herta would attempt to attack both Newgarden and Palou before he crashed into the walls near Turn 9. Newgarden then overcut Palou in the next pitstop sequence for the race lead. Herta&#x27;s teammate and former Haas F1 driver Romain Grosjean managed to pass Palou after the last round of pitstops and began to cut into Newgarden&#x27;s lead late in the race by virtue of running on a brand new set of alternate tires while Newgarden ran on used primary tires. Newgarden and Grosjean heavily leaned into their push to pass quota, with both using all of their extra horsepower heading into the final ten laps. A late yellow caused by Jimmie Johnson and David Malukas bunched the field together before Newgarden and Grosjean pulled away again for what appeared to be a near photo finish. The race ultimately ended under caution when Takuma Sato made contact with a wall on the last lap. Newgarden claimed his second victory in a row, helping Team Penske win the first three events of the season. Grosjean meanwhile finished second to earn his first podium with Andretti Autosport. Alex Palou rounded out the podium.
*2023: Kyle Kirkwood qualified on pole, his first IndyCar pole position. Kirkwood led the initial sequence of the race before a yellow caused by contact between Pato O&#x27;Ward and Scott Dixon on lap 20 shuffled the field, with most of the field pitting under caution. 2022 race winner Josef Newgarden took the lead from Kirkwood on Lap 26 and held it through the middle stint of the race. Newgarden and Romain Grosjean made their last pitstop with 32 laps to go, while Kirkwood and strategist Bryan Herta elected to remain out for one lap longer. The overcut sequence worked, Kirkwood overtook both Newgarden and Grosjean for the race lead, and held onto it for his first IndyCar win. Newgarden faded from the front of the field due to fuel saving, leading Romain Grosjean and reigning Indianapolis 500 winner Marcus Ericsson to finish second and third respectively.
*2024: Felix Rosenqvist qualified on pole, earning the first pole position ever for Meyer Shank Racing in IndyCar. Rosenqvist lost the lead on the opening lap early to Will Power. The first yellow of the day came on Lap 15 by Christian Rasmussen, and Power was forced to pit and relinquish the lead to Josef Newgarden. Newgarden later surrendered the lead under a green flag pit stop around lap 31 to Colton Herta. Herta lost the lead at lap 62 to Scott Dixon, who was running a tight fuel saving strategy. Newgarden heavily pursued Dixon in the closing laps, but was rear ended by Colton Herta and stalled with nine laps to go. This let Herta and Alex Palou by. Herta pursued Dixon heavily, but Dixon conserved enough fuel to use up his significant push to pass advantage to build a gap between himself and Herta to take his second win at Long Beach. Herta finished second and Alex Palou rounded out the podium.

<text>The Uppsala–DLR Trojan Survey (UDTS, also known as UAO–DLR Trojan Survey) is an astronomical survey to study the movements and locations of asteroids near Jupiter, which includes Jupiter trojans and other asteroids, which line-of sight are frequently blocked by the giant planet.

The survey was carried out at the Uppsala Astronomical Observatory in Sweden, in collaboration with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Principal investigators were the astronomers Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist, Gerhard Hahn, Stefano Mottola, Magnus Lundström and Uri Carsenty. The Uppsala–DLR Trojan Survey, UDTS, should not be confused with its successor, the Uppsala-DLR Asteroid Survey (UDAS), which started shortly after the UDTS concluded.

During the course of the survey, two telescopes were used at ESO&#x27;s La Silla site in northern Chile. In fall of 1996, the ESO Schmidt telescope surveyed approximately 900 deg2 at Jupiter&#x27;s Lagrangian point, location of the so-called Greek camp. Additional positions and magnitudes of asteroids were obtained using the (now decommissioned) 0.61-meter Bochum telescope.

There is some notable controversy over P/1997 T3, one of the objects found in this survey, namely an asteroid-like object with a comet-like tail. It is thought that this tail is composed of dust, due to its consistent appearance, and the fact that it is pointing towards the Sun, not away from it.

The group of Jupiter trojan contains about 6,000 asteroid. They are named after figures from Greek mythology, typically after the heroes of the Trojan War as narrated in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;.

== List of discovered minor planets ==

The Minor Planet Center credits the Uppsala–DLR Trojan Survey with the discovery of 62 numbered minor planets during 1996–1997.

<text>V, formerly Eve Ensler (; born May 25, 1953), is an American playwright, author, performer, feminist, and activist. V is best known for her play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In 2006 Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; &quot;probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade.&quot;

In 2011, V was awarded the Isabelle Stevenson Award at the 65th Tony Awards, which recognizes an individual from the theater community who has made a substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of humanitarian, social service, or charitable organizations. V was given this award for her creation of the non-profit V-Day movement which raises money and educates the public about violence against women and efforts to stop it.

She writes for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and has been featured in films including V-Day&#x27;s &quot;Until the Violence Stops&quot;, the PBS documentary &quot;What I Want My Words to Do to You&quot;, and the Netflix documentary City of Joy, among others. She regularly appears in print, radio, podcast, and television interviews including on CNN, Democracy Now, TODAY, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; and &quot;Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry&quot;.

== Personal life ==
V was born in New York City, the second of three children of Arthur Ensler, an executive in the food industry, and Chris Ensler. She was raised in the northern suburb of Scarsdale. Her father was Jewish and her mother Christian, and she grew up in a predominantly Jewish community; however, V identifies herself as a Nichiren Buddhist and says that her spiritual practice includes chanting Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō and doing yoga.

V says that from the ages of five to ten, she was sexually and physically abused by her father. Growing up, she has said she was &quot;very sad, very angry, very defiant. I was the girl with the dirty hair. I didn&#x27;t fit anywhere.&quot;

V attended Middlebury College in Vermont, where she became known as a militant feminist. After graduating in 1975, she had a string of abusive relationships and became dependent on drugs and alcohol. In 1978, she married Richard Dylan McDermott, a 34-year-old bartender, who convinced her to enter rehab. She adopted Mark Anthony McDermott, her husband&#x27;s 16-year-old son from his first marriage. Their relationship came to be a close one, and V said that it taught her &quot;how to be a loving human being&quot;. After V suffered a miscarriage, Mark took the name she had planned for her baby, Dylan. V and Dylan&#x27;s father separated in 1988, the former citing that she &quot;needed the independence, the freedom&quot;. According to a 2012 article in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;After her marriage ended, she had a long relationship with the artist and psychotherapist Ariel Orr Jordan but is single now, which seems to suit her nomadic lifestyle – she has homes in New York and Paris but travels much of the year.&quot;

A June 2010 article by V in &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that she was receiving treatment for uterine cancer. She wrote about her experience with cancer in her memoir, &quot;In The Body of the World&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; in 2012, V stated that she was two and a half years cancer free.

=== Name change ===
After publishing her book &quot;The Apology&quot; in 2019, where she described sexual and physical abuse by her late father, the author stated she wished to distance herself from the surname he used and expressed her preference to be called by the mononym V.

== &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; ==
V wrote &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in 1996. First performed in the basement of the Cornelia Street Café in Greenwich Village, the play premiered at HERE Arts Center, Off-Off-Broadway in New York and was followed by an Off-Broadway run in at Westside Theatre. Subsequently, the play has been translated into 48 languages and performed in over 140 countries. Celebrities who have starred in it include Jane Fonda, Whoopi Goldberg, Idina Menzel, Glenn Close, Susan Sarandon, Marin Mazzie, Cyndi Lauper, Mary Testa, Sandra Oh and Oprah Winfrey. V was awarded the Obie Award in 1996 for &#x27;Best New Play&#x27; and in 1999 was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship Award in Playwriting. She has also received the Berrilla-Kerr Award for Playwriting, the Elliot Norton Award for Outstanding Solo Performance, and the Jury Award for Theater at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival.

== Subsequent work ==
V&#x27;s memoir &quot;In the Body of the World&quot; was released on April 30, 2013. &quot;Booklist&quot; reviewed the book, saying, &quot;This is a ravishing book of revelation and healing, lashing truths and deep emotion, courage and perseverance, compassion and generosity. Warm, funny, furious, and astute, as well as poetic, passionate, and heroic, Ensler harnesses all that she lost and learned to articulate a galvanizing vision of the essence of life: &#x27;The only salvation is kindness.&#x27;&quot;. On February 6, 2018, she premiered a theatrical version of her memoir, which she performs as a solo monologue, directed by Diane Paulus, at the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City.

She contributed the piece &quot;Theater: A Sacred Home for Women&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

V provided uncredited contributions to the book for &quot;Wicked&quot;, the fourth-longest running Broadway show in history. 

From October 2005 to April 2006, V toured twenty North American cities with her play &quot;The Good Body&quot;, following engagements on Broadway, at ACT in San Francisco, and in a workshop production at Seattle Repertory Theatre. &quot;The Good Body&quot; addresses why women of many cultures and backgrounds perceive pressure to change the way they look in order to be accepted in the eyes of society.

V&#x27;s play, &quot;The Treatment&quot; debuted on September 12, 2006, at the Culture Project in New York City. This play explores the moral and psychological trauma that are the result of participation in military conflicts. It stars her adoptive son, Dylan McDermott.

In 2006, V released her first major work written exclusively for the printed page. &quot;Insecure at Last: Losing It In Our Security-Obsessed World&quot; (Villard; Hardcover; October 3, 2006). In &quot;Insecure at Last&quot;, she explores how people live today, the measures people take to keep themselves safe, and how people can experience freedom by letting go of the deceptive notion of &quot;protection&quot;. In 2006 V also co-edited &quot;A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer&quot;, an anthology of writings about violence against women.

V&#x27;s work &quot;I Am An Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around The World&quot;, a collection of original monologues about and for girls that aims to inspire girls to take agency over their minds, bodies, hearts and curiosities, was released February 2010 in book form by Villard/Random House and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The book was workshopped in July 2010 at New York Stage and Film and Vassar College, moving toward an Off-Broadway production. The theatrical production of the piece, titled &quot;Emotional Creature&quot;, had its United States debut at the Berkeley Repertory Theater in Berkeley, CA in June 2012. In February 2012, The South African production of &quot;Emotional Creature&quot; was nominated for a 2011 Naledi Theatre Award for Best Ensemble Production/Cutting Edge Production.

V was a consultant on feminism and women&#x27;s issues for the 2015 action film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;.

In 2019, V published the book &quot;The Apology&quot;, where she imagines what her now dead father would say if he was able to apologize for the sexual and physical abuse he inflicted on her as a child. After completing the work, V said that she had ceased to feel any bitterness towards her father, but that she no longer wished to carry his name, inviting people to call her V.

== Activism ==
V is an activist addressing issues of violence against women and girls. In 1998, her experience performing &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; inspired her to create V-Day, a global activist movement to stop violence against women and girls. V-Day raises funds and awareness through annual benefit productions of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In 2010, more than 5,400 V-Day events took place in over 1,500 locations in the U.S. and around the world. As of 2014, the V-Day movement had raised over $100 million and educated millions about the issue of violence against women and the efforts to end it, crafted international educational, media and PSA campaigns, launched the Karama program in the Middle East, reopened shelters, and funded over 12,000 community-based anti-violence programs and safe houses in Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, South Dakota, Egypt and Iraq. These safe houses provide women sanctuary from abuse, female genital mutilation and &#x27;honor&#x27; killing. The &#x27;V&#x27; in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina.

In February 2004, V, alongside Sally Field, Jane Fonda and Christine Lahti, protested to have the Mexican government re-investigate the slayings of hundreds of women in Ciudad Juárez, a city along the Texas border.

V is a supporter of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) and went to Afghanistan under the rule of the Taliban. She supports Afghan women and has organized many programs for them. She organized one event named the &quot;Afghani Women&#x27;s Summit For Democracy&quot;.

V has led a writing group since 1998 at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, which was portrayed in &quot;What I Want My Words To Do To You&quot;. Judy Clark, Kathy Boudin, and Pamela Smart were among the writing group&#x27;s participants featured in the film.

In 2011, V-Day and the Fondation Panzi (DRC), with support from UNICEF, opened the City of Joy, a new community for women survivors of gender violence in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). City of Joy provides up to 180 Congolese women a year with an opportunity to benefit from group therapy; self-defense training; comprehensive sexuality education (covering HIV/AIDS, family planning); economic empowerment; storytelling; dance; theater; ecology and horticulture. Created from their vision, Congolese women run, operate and direct City of Joy themselves. The City of Joy celebrated its first graduating class in February 2012. The story of the City of Joy, including V&#x27;s involvement, is portrayed in the documentary City of Joy, screening on Netflix.

In 2012, along with the V-Day movement, V created One Billion Rising, a global protest campaign to end violence, and promote justice and gender equality for women. On February 14, 2013, V-Day&#x27;s 15th anniversary, women and men in countries around the world held dance actions to demand an end to violence against women and girls.

In 2016, V co-signed a letter to Ban Ki-moon calling for a more humane drug policy, along with Warren Buffett, John Legend and Elizabeth Warren.

In 2017 in an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; V voiced criticism of the newly inaugurated president of the United States, Donald Trump, referring to him as a &quot;self-confessed sexual assaulter&quot; and &quot;our predator-in-chief&quot;.

In 2020, V endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States in the 2020 election.

<doc id="967581" wikidata="Q712854" url="?curid=967581" title="Leung Kwok-hung">
<text>Leung Kwok-hung (; born 27 March 1956), also known by his nickname &quot;Long Hair&quot; (), is a Hong Kong politician and social activist. He was a member of the Legislative Council, representing the New Territories East. A Trotskyist in his youth, he was a founding member of the Revolutionary Marxist League. He became a political icon with his long hair and Che Guevara T-shirt in the protests before he was elected to the Legislative Council in 2004. In 2006, he co-founded a social democratic party, the League of Social Democrats (LSD) of which he was the chairman from 2012 to 2016.

In 2017, he announced his candidacy for the 2017 Chief Executive election, through unofficial public petition, but withdrew after failing to receive enough signatures. On 14 July 2017, Leung was disqualified by the court over his manner on oath of office at the inaugural meeting of the Legislative Council on 12 October 2016 as a result of the oath-taking controversy.

==Early life and social activism==
Leung was born on 27 March 1956 in Hong Kong to a family from Guangdong Province. Born in Shau Kei Wan, he later moved into Chai Wan Estate. He was raised in a single family after his father left home when Leung was six-years-old, while his mother was an amah in a British family to support the family and Leung had to live with relatives back in Shau Kei Wan who had seven children.

Leung was educated at the Clementi Secondary School. Leung credits his political awakening to the Cultural Revolution and the 1967 Hong Kong riots, participating in the &quot;Maoist student movement&quot;. He and his mother were members of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (HKFTU), the left-wing pro-communist labour union at the time. After the falls of Lin Biao and the Gang of Four which crushed the Maoist idealism, Leung reflected his political belief, and delved himself into Trotskyism under the influence of the social activist icons at that time such as Ng Chung-yin.

In 1975, he co-founded the Revolutionary Marxist League, a Trotskyist vanguard party, in which he became active in political actions. He was arrested multiple times, including in the protests of supporting the 1976 April Fifth Tiananmen Incident and Chinese democracy movement. His first prosecution was in 1979 when he protested for the Yau Ma Tei boat people. Later in the same year he was charged and jailed for a month for &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; for a protest at the Victoria Park.
After his release, he worked as a construction worker from 1981 to 1986. In 1986, Leung worked for Kowloon Motor Bus as an overnight vehicle cleaner. Around 1988, he formed the April Fifth Action after the Revolutionary Marxist League was disbanded. The group is well known for its aggressive and civil disobedience-style actions to protest against the governments of China and Hong Kong during celebrations and visits of state leaders, often resulting in confrontations with the Hong Kong police. They usually carry a coffin as their trademark protest prop. Leung supported the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was a member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China.

He has been briefly jailed several times for offences such as shouting from Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo) public viewing gallery, burning the national flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and forcibly breaking into an opposition political event. In 2000, he and Koo Sze-yiu were prosecuted for disrupting a LegCo meeting and were later jailed for 14 days, becoming the first dissents to be jailed after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Before that he had been charged 14 times, of which 11 ended in convictions.

==Legislative Council bids and founding of LSD==
Leung first contested in the Legislative Council election in 2000, where he ran in the New Territories East. He received 18,235 votes, about six percent of the total vote share and was not elected. On 1 July 2003, protests against the National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 that had been proposed by the unpopular Tung Chee-hwa administration attracted more than 500,000 people marching in the streets. The further antagonism towards the government helped further boost the popularity of pro-democracy activists including Leung Kwok-hung. In the 2003 District Council election, Leung challenged the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) legislator Choy So-yuk&#x27;s seat in the Kam Ping constituency which was seen as pro-Beijing traditional stronghold. He called out the DAB as the &quot;loyalist party&quot; and received 1,149, only 284 short to defeat Choy.

Leung ran again in the Legislative Council election in 2004 in New Territories East and succeeded in winning a seat in LegCo with 60,925 votes at the expense of the moderate Andrew Wong, former Legislative Council President, He received over 200% increase in votes compared to the 18,235 votes in 2000. His campaigns include universal suffrage, workers&#x27; rights and welfare for the less well off. His political agenda include introduction of a liveable minimum wage, comprehensive social security, collective bargaining and taxing speculative business. Although he expresses his fondness for Che Guevara and the ideals of revolutionary Marxism, Leung has not included a proletarian revolution agenda on his election platform and many of his ideas and proposals would be readily accepted by most mainstream social liberal and social democratic parties in other countries.

For the swearing-in ceremony of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 6 October 2004, Leung&#x27;s fellow members arrived in business attire. He, in contrast, wore a T-shirt with Tiananmen Square on the front and Che Guevara on the back. When he was called to come forward and take the oath, he raised his left fist, encircled with a black wristband, a memorial to those who died in the 1989 protests. He had planned to alter his oath of office, but a Hong Kong judge said such a step would make it impossible for him to serve. Instead, Leung added his own messages to the standard oath, demanding vindication for those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to one-party rule on the Mainland. He shouted at the ceremony: &quot;Long live democracy! Long live the people!&quot; He was then sworn in as a council member. Observers watched closely the reaction from the PRC government, as Leung&#x27;s statements touched upon a politically sensitive issue that is considered taboo in official public settings. Leung&#x27;s populist and unorthodox confrontational style contrasts with the usually restrained atmosphere of LegCo. Rita Fan, the then LegCo President, seemed more concerned by Leung&#x27;s attire for LegCo meetings than any of his political opinions. One legislator commented that &quot;LegCo has to get used to Leung, and he has to get used to LegCo.&quot;
In 2005, Leung took part in the protests against the WTO Conference in Hong Kong and was injured during the demonstration. Leung was arrested along with 900 other demonstrators. As with almost all other persons rounded up on that day, Leung was released shortly after and was not prosecuted.

In 2006, Leung co-founded the social democratic party League of Social Democrats (LSD) with legislator Albert Chan and radical pro-democrat radio host Wong Yuk-man. In the 2008 Legislative Council election, Leung was re-elected in the New Territories East while Chan and Wong were also elected in New Territories West and Kowloon West respectively which made the LSD in the third largest pro-democracy party after Democratic Party and Civic Party, which took a more moderate and pro-middle class position as compared to the LSD.

==Denied entry to Sichuan in 2008==
Leung has not had a Home Return Permit since 1989, after the Tiananmen Massacre, having been denied one by the Chinese authorities, but he was able to visit mainland China once in the company of his mother in about 2003. He was also able to visit mainland China in 2005, on an invitation to Hong Kong legislators, including pan-democrats, to visit Guangdong. Some of the other pan-democrat legislators also had not had an individual permit since 1989.

On 4 July 2008 Leung was scheduled to visit areas in Sichuan damaged by the Sichuan earthquake as part of a 20-member delegation. Leung&#x27;s travel permit application was rejected at the last minute on suspicions he would protest in China during the three-day trip. Sichuan officials claimed to have seen Internet reports saying Leung planned to do something not relevant to the purpose of the trip. Rita Fan confirmed those were the grounds of denial. Leung responded saying: &quot;It&#x27;s so ironic. People said the Olympic Games will make China more open up. I think it&#x27;s going backward.&quot;

==Five Constituencies Referendum==
In 2010, Leung and four other pro-democrat legislators launched the &quot;Five Constituencies Referendum&quot; to press the government to implement universal suffrage of the Chief Executive and Legislative Council by resigning from each constituency and trigger a territory-wide by-election. Leung explained that his resignation in January was, &quot;in keeping with [his] campaign promise... to fight for direct elections.&quot; Although being elected in May with 108,927 votes, the campaign failed to draw high turnout rate due to the boycott by the pro-Beijing camp, . Leung accused the Democratic Party for not participating in the campaign and instead reached a controversial agreement with the Beijing government over the reform proposal.

In the 2011 District Council elections, LSD chairman Andrew To&#x27;s refusal of fielding candidates against the Democrats led former chairman Wong Yuk-man and legislator Albert Chan to quit the party with hundreds party members over the disagreement as well as the intra-party factional struggles. Leung, being the only legislator left in the party refused to follow Wong and Chan. Leung subsequently took over as party chairman after To resigned when he lost his seat in the District Council elections. Leung himself also ran in the election against DAB legislator Ip Kwok-him in his stronghold Kwun Lung but lost with a wide margin of 1,800 votes.

After the 2010 by-election, the government considered the resignations were abusive to the system and planned to plug the loophole. A Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012 was proposed to disqualify a resigned member of the Legislative Council from participating in a subsequent by-election. Leung participated in the filibustering against the bill with Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man, submitting 1,306 amendments altogether, which began the radical democrats&#x27; filibustering practice against the government bills in the following years. On morning of 17 May 2012, LegCo President Jasper Tsang, adopted Article 92 of the Standing Order, which allows the president follow foreign parliament rules for unregulated behaviours to terminate the debate. In the end, all amendments were defeated and the Bill was passed on 1 June 2012.

==Third term as Legislative Councillor==
In the 2012 Legislative Council election, with 48,295 votes, among the highest votes in the constituency. In 2013, he and other radical pan-democrats started filibustering by moving a total of 710 amendments on the Budget Appropriation Bill debate, to press for a universal pension scheme and a HK$10,000 cash handout. The government warned that the service would shut down if the budget bill do not pass. LegCo President Jasper Tsang ordered to end the filibuster on 13 May after 55 hours spent to debate 17 of the 148 amendments. The Appropriation Bill was passed on 21 May 2013 with 684 amendments negatived.

Leung opposed the government&#x27;s constitutional package on the 2016/2017 Legislative Council and Chief Executive elections. After the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) set the restrictive framework on the Chief Executive candidates, the student activist groups organised a week-long student strike. On 26 September 2014 toward the end of the strike, 100 protesters led by student leader Joshua Wong rushed into the square of the government headquarters. The police clearance drew thousands of protesters at the scene. In the next morning, the Occupy Central with Love and Peace led by scholar Benny Tai announced their early launch of the planned occupy protests. Feeling being highjacked, some protesters began to leave the scene, while Leung Kwok-hung dropped to his knees in front of the protesters, asking them for staying in the scene. &quot;If you want to achieve a goal in the long term – in this case, true democracy in Hong Kong – you need to unify all powers who are fighting for this goal and establish a platform to let them all participate&quot;, he later told the press. For his long term experiences in protests, he became one of the leaders in the 2014 Hong Kong protests and kept being seen in the scene, but he was criticised by some militant radicals for his non-violence doctrine.

In May 2015, Leung was barred from entering Malaysia along with Joshua Wong on grounds that their presence in the country would damage Malaysia&#x27;s ties with China. Leung condemned the Malaysian government and accused it of violating his basic rights.

In 2016 Legislative Council election Leung was once again re-elected with 35,595 votes. Leung came in ninth in the nine-seat constituency, with only 1,051 votes separating him from the unelected Christine Fong due to the infighting among the pan-democracy camp and surges of many localist candidates with more radical agenda.

==Oath-taking controversy and disqualification==

At the inaugural meeting of the 6th Legislative Council on 12 October, he took the oath-taking ceremony as his protest platform like his previous oaths. He wore a black T-shirt with the word &quot;civil disobedience&quot; in Chinese and held an opened yellow umbrella symbolising the Umbrella Revolution with many words thereon, including &quot;ending the one-party rule&quot;, and a paper board showing the words &quot;NPC 831 decision&quot; and a cross on it. He paused many times while reading the oath and tore a piece of paper with the words &quot;NPC 831 decision&quot;. His oath was validated by the clerk.

However, after the oaths of the two localist legislators Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration were invalidated by the clerk, the duo were unprecedentedly legally challenged by Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen. On 7 November 2016, the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) interpreted of the Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, standardising the manners of the oath-taking when taking public office. As a result, the duo were disqualified by the court. Subsequently, the government launched a second legal action against Leung and three other pro-democracy legislators, Lau Siu-lai, Yiu Chung-yim and Nathan Law, which resulted in their disqualifications from the Legislative Council on 14 July 2017.

==2017 Chief Executive bid==

Leung Kwok-hung launched his Chief Executive bid in February 2017 through a &quot;public nomination&quot; mechanism conducted by post-Occupy group Citizens United in Action, in which he would seek to secure 37,790 votes from members of the public, one per cent of the city&#x27;s registered voters before he would canvass for the nominations from the Election Committee. He explained his decision was to urge the pro-democrat electors not to vote for any pro-establishment candidates who could not represent the pro-democracy camp at all even if they see them as &quot;lesser evils&quot;, as some pro-democrats had inclined to support John Tsang, the relatively liberal pro-establishment candidate to prevent a hardliner Carrie Lam from winning. He also aimed to reflect the spirit of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the voice of those low-income people. His bid was supported by four radical democrat legislators People Power&#x27;s Raymond Chan, Demosisto&#x27;s Nathan Law, Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu, while the mainstream pro-democrats cast doubt over Leung&#x27;s candidacy, believing it would contribute to the victory to Carrie Lam.

On 25 February, Leung announced he would not run for the Chief Executive, as he only secured 20,234 nominations from the general public, about 17,000 fewer than the threshold. Among the 20,234 nominations, 13,440 were collected in public while the rest of them online. Leung stated that he being able to collect more than 20,000 nominations with personal contact information and identity card numbers had proved that &quot;civil nomination&quot; is achievable.

==Arrests, attack, and criminal convictions==
Until the end of 2024, Leung accumulated 25 convictions, some of which were for unauthorized assembly.

On 18 April 2020, Leung was arrested as one of 15 Hong Kong high-profile democracy figures, on suspicion of organizing, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019 in the course of the anti-extradition bill protests. Following protocol, the police statement did not disclose the names of the accused. A day prior to his arrest, he was stabbed with a sharp object while demonstrating in solidarity with pro-democracy legislator Dennis Kwok, who had been strongly criticized by the pro-Beijing camp. The attack happened in front of the Liaison Office and he was helped by fellow activist Raphael Wong before being moved to a hospital, where he was later discharged at his own request. In September 2020, the 81-year-old man who stabbed him went on trial for the attack and was controversially praised by the magistrate for &quot;loving society&quot;. The elderly man was also quoted as saying he wanted activists Joshua Wong and Ted Hui &quot;to die as soon as possible&quot;, and included Leung in the same wish. He was sentenced in October 2020 to a prison term of three months and six days.

In August 2020, Leung was among a large group of pro-democracy figures charged for the banned vigil commemorating the 31st anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

On 6 September 2020, he was arrested when protesting the postponement of the 2020 Hong Kong Legislative Council election. On 15 September 2020 he appeared before the court for the banned Tiananmen anniversary gathering where he criticized the Chinese Communist Party. On 8 December 2020, Leung was arrested again for &quot;unauthorised assembly&quot; during the July 1 protest of that year and was released on bail pending a court appearance. His party condemned his arrest.

===Arrest under National Security Law===

On 6 January 2021, Leung was arrested along with more than 50 other pan-democrats, accused of violating the national security law over their participation in the pro-democracy primaries of 2020. He was accused of &quot;subverting state power.&quot; Leung was released on bail on 7 January.

On 28 February 2021, Leung was formally charged, along with 46 others, with subversion and was arrested again. On 4 March, he was denied bail and he remained in prison. On 12 March, Leung was again denied bail citing national security risks. On 29 March 2021, the High Court denied him bail again and he will remain in custody until the next hearing on the case on 31 May 2021.

On 13 May 2021, High Court judge Esther Toh, upheld her decision to deny bail to Leung alleging his determinate opposition to the government and the national security law. Toh also argued that Leung had foreign and international support if released and that he was at high risk of reoffending.

On 5 September 2022, Leung pleaded not-guilty to subversion charges.

On 30 May 2024, Leung was found guilty of conspiracy to commit subversion.

On 19 November 2024, Leung was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison.

===Convictions===
On 16 April 2021, Leung was found guilty of taking part in unauthorised assembly and was sentenced to 18 months&#x27; imprisonment.

On 24 May 2021, Leung pleaded guilty over another unauthorised assembly in 2019 which turned violent. Leung was defiant during the mitigation hearing in court and said that however he pleaded guilty, he believed he had done nothing wrong. On 28 May 2021, Leung was sentenced to an additional 18 months&#x27; imprisonment over the 2019 unauthorised assembly.

On 16 October 2021, Leung was sentenced to further eight months&#x27; imprisonment over un unauthorised assembly in July 2020, in a protest against the national security law.

In March 2022, an additional sentence of two weeks in prison was added to Leung&#x27;s overall sentence, after he was convicted of contempt during his time at LegCo.

In July 2022, Leung and seven other activists, appealed his conviction for violating COVID-19 restrictions during Labour Day in 2020, citing &quot;disproportionate&quot; measures from the government. On 18 October 2022, the appeal was rejected by a court.

=== Health in prison ===
In early May 2022, Leung&#x27;s wife said that Leung had been frequently visiting hospital from prison due to a heart condition, but dismissed rumors that Leung was seriously ill with COVID-19. Leung&#x27;s wife also said that his mental health had &quot;upheavals&quot;.

==Image and sartorial preference==

Leung is widely referred to by the sobriquet &quot;Long Hair&quot; (), and press photographs show him with long locks as early as 1977. In 2020, he won a court case and avoided a compulsory haircut as the Court of Final Appeal ruled that compulsory haircuts for male prisoners amounted to sexual discrimination, and thereby overturned a lower court&#x27;s decision in 2018. Leung has several other nicknames including &quot;Mr Kwoktastic&quot;, &quot;Kwok It Up&quot; and &quot;The Kwokmaster&quot;.

Leung is reputed to have vowed not to cut his hair until the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China apologised for the Tiananmen Square massacre although he has denied this on several occasions.

Leung is a smoker and can often be seen sporting a T-shirt with the iconic likeness of his favoured Che Guevara and smoking a cigarette. He is a fan of the Homeless World Cup and has accompanied Hong Kong&#x27;s team to the tournament for several years.

He says he learned English by listening to the British Forces Broadcasting Service radio station.

==Personal life==
Leung is married to fellow activist and deputy secretary-general of the League of Social Democrats Chan Po-ying. The couple wed in January 2021, after 45 years together, anticipating Leung&#x27;s re-arrest and conviction under the National Security Law, and alert to the greater prison visiting rights of spouses.

<text>Library Hotel is a 60-room boutique hotel in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is located at 299 Madison Avenue (at 41st Street), near Bryant Park, the New York Public Library Main Branch, and Grand Central Terminal. The hotel was designed by architect Stephen B. Jacobs.

Each of the Library Hotel&#x27;s ten guest floors is themed after a major category of the Dewey Decimal Classification. The 5th floor, for example, is the 500s (the Sciences). Each room is a subcategory or genre, such as Mathematics (Room 500.001) or Botany (Room 500.004). Dewey categories 000, 100, and 200 are placed on the 10th, 11th, and 12th floors, respectively. There are 50–100 books and decorations in each room that accompany the theme, for a total of 6,000 books throughout the hotel.

Due to this classification scheme, the hotel owners were sued in 2003 by OCLC (owners of the Dewey Decimal Classification system). OCLC subsequently reached an agreement with the hotel owners, thus enabling the hotel to continue using the Dewey system.

The Library Hotel is operated by Henry Kallan — working alongside a Principal Managing Partner, whose Library Hotel Collection includes Manhattan&#x27;s Hotel Giraffe, Hotel Elysée, Casablanca Hotel, Hotel X Toronto.

<text>The BNSF Railway Bridge 5.1, also known as the St. Johns Railroad Bridge or the Willamette River Railroad Bridge, is a through truss railway bridge with a vertical lift that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States. Built by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S) and completed in 1908, it was originally a swing-span bridge, and its swing-span section was the longest in the world at the time. However, 81 years later the main span was converted from a swing-type to a vertical-lift type, in order to widen the navigation channel. The lift span is one of the highest and longest in the world. The bridge consists of five sections, with the two sections closest to the bank on each side fixed.

The BNSF Railway owns the bridge, and the 5.1 denotes the distance in miles from Portland&#x27;s Union Station or from the nearby North Bank Depot (or Hoyt Street Depot), which was the Portland terminus of SP&amp;S passenger service coming via this bridge until 1922. The bridge&#x27;s two tracks are used by freight trains of BNSF and Union Pacific Railroad and by Amtrak passenger trains. Of 12 bridges across the Willamette River within the city of Portland, it is the sole rail-only bridge and the only bridge not open to the public. It is located at river mile 6.9.

==History==
The original, swing-span bridge was built in 1906–08 by the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway (SP&amp;S), as part of construction of a new line between Vancouver, Washington and Portland. SP&amp;S was formed jointly by the Northern Pacific Railway and Great Northern Railway, originally as the Portland &amp; Seattle Railway, to build and ultimately operate new railroad lines from Portland to Seattle and Portland to Spokane, but was renamed &quot;Spokane&quot;, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway—in early 1908, before opening any track sections—after construction of the Portland–Spokane line got under way before the Seattle line. The planned new railroad was commonly referred to as the &quot;North Bank road&quot; (road being short for railroad or railroad line), or North Bank line, because the Seattle line would follow the Columbia River&#x27;s north bank as far as Kelso and the Spokane line would also follow the north bank, running east from Vancouver. East from Portland, the south bank of the Columbia already had a rail line, owned by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (later absorbed by Union Pacific Railroad).

===Design and construction===
The new Portland–Vancouver rail line also included two other major bridges, the Columbia River Railroad Bridge (now known as BNSF Railway Bridge 9.6) and the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge. Northern Pacific hired bridge engineer Ralph Modjeski in 1905 to design all three. Modjeski&#x27;s designs called for all three to use swing spans for their opening sections. However, for the Willamette crossing, this recommendation was met with resistance by some. River boat pilots were concerned that a swing span, which requires a center pivot pier, would leave too-narrow a navigation channel for the large ships that used this section of the river. At that time, Portland&#x27;s Steel, Burnside, Morrison and Madison Street bridges were all swing-type, with center pivot piers seen by boat pilots as inconvenient obstacles. The Port of Portland organized a committee in January 1906 to determine the feasibility of a bascule-type draw span by inspecting existing bascule bridges in Chicago and other eastern cities. Modjeski and a group of Portland engineers declared a bascule design to be impractical, and the president of the Portland &amp; Seattle Railway stated his preference for a swing draw &quot;as being more serviceable and reliable and better adapted to the river channel.&quot; After undertaking their inspection, the Port of Portland committee also concluded that a bascule design would be impractical. The original recommendation for a swing span was ultimately accepted, and plans for the bridge were sent to the Secretary of War for approval in May 1906.
Construction of the Willamette River bridge began in August 1906. Its swing-span section was the longest in the world, with a length of or . To either side of the opening span are two fixed truss spans and one deck plate girder approach span.

Overall, the construction took more than two years. Structural work was completed in July 1908, and the first test swing of the center span was accomplished by a tugboat pushing on it, as the heavy machinery for that purpose had yet to be installed. Problems with the supply and installation of parts of the machinery for turning the swing span caused a delay of a few months, and not until October was the span turned for the first time under its own power. The first train crossed on October 23, 1908, and the bridge opened for regular use in November. The Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway&#x27;s first scheduled passenger train on the new line into and out of Portland operated on November 17, 1908, and the terminus in Portland was the North Bank Depot on N.W. Hoyt Street at 11th Avenue, rather than Union Station. SP&amp;S service moved to Union Station in 1922.

The total weight of the swing span was around 4.6 million pounds, including 400,000 pounds for the machinery. In the event of a power outage, the bridge&#x27;s swing span could still be turned, using a 165-hp, four-cylinder back-up generator to power the electric motors. The drum on which the span pivoted was in diameter.

Ownership and operation of the bridge passed to the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) in 1970, when SP&amp;S, Northern Pacific and other railroads merged to form BN. At the end of 1996, BN merged with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (Santa Fe), becoming the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (officially shortened to BNSF Railway in 2005).

==Accidents==
The bridge sustained heavy damage on October 29, 1978, when it was struck by a Norwegian container ship, the m.v. &quot;Marie Bakke&quot;. The ship hit the downstream end of the swing span, which had been in the fully open position; that was its normal position, as the span was closed only when trains needed to cross. Repairs took seven weeks, not being completed until January 1979. Meanwhile, BN and Amtrak trains had to be rerouted via Union Pacific tracks and across the Steel Bridge to reach the west side of the river. BN filed suit against the shipping line that owned the vessel, charging negligence and seeking damages, and ultimately reached an out-of-court settlement under which it received about $3.5 million from the shipping company.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1983, at about 10:25 p.m., two locomotives heading a BN freight train plunged into the river through the open swing span, resulting in the deaths of two crew persons. It was the worst train-related accident in the bridge&#x27;s history. The cause was determined to have been human error, that the train crew had passed a red signal.

==Rebuilding as vertical-lift bridge==

The center swing span was replaced by a vertical-lift span and towers in a two-year project completed in 1989, funded primarily by a federal grant. Prior to this change, numerous ships had struck the bridge over the years, the worst incident being the 1978 one described above, and the bridge&#x27;s center pier ultimately was deemed an impediment to river navigation. That assessment was made by the U.S. Coast Guard, and it led to Congressional approval of a $38 million grant to pay for the work. Conversion to a vertical lift permitted the central pivot pier to be removed, greatly widening the navigation channel. In addition to increasing safety, the wider clearance would allow larger ships to reach the Port of Portland&#x27;s then-new (1978) dry dock facility for ship repair and rebuilding at Swan Island, and Port officials cited both of these benefits in their support of the planned change. After design and engineering were completed, a $28 million contract was awarded in May 1987 to Portland-based Riedel International Inc. to carry out the work. The Coast Guard financed most of the cost of the conversion, but Burlington Northern paid about 3 percent of the cost.
In order to minimize disruption to both river traffic and rail traffic, the project was carefully coordinated to allow the change to be made over just 72 hours. This work began on August 8, 1989, with removal of the 81-year-old swing-span section, and was completed on August 11. The pivot pier was removed by dynamite blasting three months later, after the fall fish run, and with that final step the navigation channel was widened from to .

The lift span is one of the longest vertical-lift spans in the world and is also the fourth-highest in the world. When fully raised, it provides vertical clearance of at low water. The new lift span weighs . It is made of weathering steel, which is designed to rust naturally and thus turn a reddish brown. However, the remainder of the bridge, the fixed spans dating from 1908, are painted silver. This has given the rebuilt structure two distinct colors, and the unusual combination has been called unattractive by some.

==Operation==

The bridge carries two tracks across the Willamette River and is used by freight trains and Amtrak trains. Although BNSF Railway owns and controls the bridge, the company is required to allow access to other railroads, under a law already in force by 1906 allowing common use of railway bridges across navigable waterways. Signals on both approaches prevent trains from entering the bridge when the lift span is up, but as a precaution, all trains are still required to radio the bridge tender to obtain permission to cross. A bridge tender is on duty 24 hours a day, year-round.

The bridge is crossed by about 30 to 35 trains per day.

<text>The wearing of academic scarves is a tradition found at many colleges and universities in English-speaking countries, and particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Sets of two or more coloured stripes have traditionally been used as part of the distinctive visual identity of these institutions. The scarves are usually made of Saxony wool and traditionally 6 feet (c. 2m) long. The traditional vertical stripes were (according to one source) adopted first at the University of Cambridge during the Second World War when material scarcity created scarves made of strips of wool sewn together rather than woven into the fabric.

The colours are often derived from the colours of the official coat of arms and/or the varsity colours, and are used in clothing and symbols of all kinds, from ties to trophies, but notably in the long woollen winter scarves that students and alumni wear to show their pride in their institutions. Some universities have different scarves for different faculties and even for undergraduates and postgraduates. Some may even have a &#x27;combination scarf&#x27; where one side is in the university&#x27;s colours and the other the faculty, etc. colours. Traditionally, academic scarves would not have further embroidery on them, such as arms or logos, as the stripes are sufficient to identify the scarf&#x27;s origins and affiliation; however, at some universities such as Cambridge it has become usual for scarves to be embroidered with the college arms. Furthermore, universities might change their design and colours from time to time, usually during re-branding exercises, or if there is not an &#x27;official&#x27; version that has been widely used. For example the University of Manchester was created in 2004 by merging two previous institutions, and adopted the new colours of purple and gold, along with changing scarf colours.

At some universities, in addition to collegiate scarves, there are also several non-collegiate scarves which have a well-established meaning. For example, those representing the university in sport may be entitled to wear a particular scarf, depending on their level of achievement, or a university department or club may have its own scarf. In addition, some colleges and universities have (for example) separate scarves for senior clubs such as their Boat Clubs.

Academic scarves are to be distinguished from other types of scarves that are officially sold by the institution themselves which often use different colours and are embroidered with logos and other emblem, or designed/made differently to traditional academic scarves.

<text>Barry (DD-248/APD-29) was a &quot;Clemson&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the second ship named for Commodore John Barry.

&quot;Barry&quot; was launched 28 October 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Co., Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. Shelton E. Martin, great-grandniece of Commodore Barry, and commissioned with 50 percent complement 28 December 1920.

==Service history==
&quot;Barry&quot; was held in reserve commission until 15 November 1921, when she was placed in full commission and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. In October 1922, she departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, for the Mediterranean where she served with the U. S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters until July 1923. Returning to the East Coast 10 August 1923, she joined Destroyer Squadron 14, Scouting Fleet. Later in August and September, &quot;Barry&quot; operated as a plane guard in the Atlantic for the U.S. Army&#x27;s &quot;Around the World Flight&quot; and was stationed between Labrador and Nova Scotia, Canada. When one of the three Army planes ditched owing to engine trouble, &quot;Barry&quot; transported the pilots to Pictou, Nova Scotia, where they boarded a replacement plane to continue their flight home to Seattle via Boston and across the United States.

Early in 1925, &quot;Barry&quot; transited the Panama Canal and joined the Battle Fleet for maneuvers in the Pacific. She returned to the East Coast in July 1925, and took up routine duties with the Scouting Fleet until February 1932, when she returned to the Pacific for fleet maneuvers. Upon completion of maneuvers, she returned to the Atlantic and was assigned to Rotating Reserve Destroyer Squadron 19 at Norfolk, 20 December 1932.

&quot;Barry&quot; was recommissioned at Norfolk 20 June 1933 and on 1 July sailed for San Diego to Join Destroyer Division 7, Scouting Force. She served with the Scouting Force until May 1936 when she returned to the Atlantic and for a short time served as flagship of Destroyer Division 8. Later in 1936 she again returned to the Pacific, joining Destroyer Division 22, Battle Force. Between January and April 1938 she was in Hawaiian waters and on 21 May 1938 was transferred to Destroyer Division 21, in the Atlantic.

===World War II===
&quot;Barry&quot; joined Destroyer Division 67 in the Canal Zone 18 October 1940. Still on duty there when the United States entered World War II, she was assigned escort and anti-submarine warfare missions against the German submarines in the Atlantic. Early in 1942, &quot;Barry&quot; operated in the Caribbean escorting convoys between Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Panama; and Curaçao and Trinidad. Later in the year and throughout the first half of 1943 she performed escort duties in the South Atlantic, operating from Trinidad.

Between July and November 1943, she served as a unit of TG 21.14, an offensive antisubmarine patrol which operated along the North Atlantic convoy lanes. The group conducted two sweeps (30 July – 10 September and 28 September – 8 November) during which aircraft from sank eight German submarines. &quot;Barry&quot; and rescued survivors of after she was fatally damaged 1 November while sinking by ramming.

&quot;Barry&quot; underwent conversion to a high-speed transport at Charleston Navy Yard, 31 December 1943 – 17 February 1944 (reclassified APD-29, 15 January 1944). &quot;Barry&quot; departed the East Coast 13 April 1944 for Mers-el-Kebir, Algeria, arriving 30 April. Practice amphibious landings were carried out until 14 August, when she sortied for the invasion of southern France.

Between 15 and 20 August 1944, she landed her troops on the Islands of Levant and Port Cros, as well as on the mainland of France. Between August and December, &quot;Barry&quot; served on escort duty in the western Mediterranean and then returned to the United States, arriving at Norfolk 23 December 1944. After brief repairs, &quot;Barry&quot; departed for the Pacific and arrived at Pearl Harbor 24 March 1945. After training in the Hawaiian Islands, she arrived off Okinawa 16 May and performed patrol and escort duties during the occupation of the island.

==Fate==
On 25 May, she was attacked by two &quot;kamikazes&quot; while on patrol 35 miles northwest of Okinawa. One was shot down, but the other broke through the barrage and struck &quot;Barry&quot; below her bridge. Twenty-eight of her crew were wounded by shrapnel. The explosion of the plane&#x27;s gasoline tanks and bomb ignited fuel oil escaping from &quot;Barry&quot;″s ruptured tanks. The fire threatened the forward magazine which could not be reached to flood. At 1340, 40 minutes after the plane struck, the commanding officer gave the order to abandon ship. &quot;Barry&quot;″s boats were lowered and all hands safely cleared the side.

At 1500, the water had risen until the forward magazine was covered, minimizing the danger of explosion. A skeleton crew, together with parties from and then reboarded &quot;Barry&quot; and the last fires were extinguished at 0630 the next day.

&quot;Barry&quot; was towed to the anchorage at Kerama Retto 28 May, and was found too extensively damaged to warrant repair or salvage. Stripped of useful gear, she was decommissioned 21 June 1945. Later in the day, she was towed from the harbor of Kerama Retto to be used as a decoy for the &quot;kamikazes&quot;. At 1845, while under tow, two Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;kamikazes&quot; attacked, coming in low over the surrounding land. One plane hit &quot;Barry&quot; and the other hit her escort, , sinking both ships. LSM-59 sank in thirteen minutes with two dead and eight wounded, while &quot;Barry&quot; settled to six inches of freeboard and sank the next morning despite salvage efforts.

==Awards==
*Presidential Unit Citation (as a unit of TG 21.14)
*American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp
*American Campaign Medal with one battle star
*European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two battle stars 
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star
*World War II Victory Medal

&quot;Barry&quot; was possibly the only U.S. Navy ship to receive battle stars for all three area campaign medals.

<text>Malassezia is a genus of fungi (specifically, a yeast).

Some species of &quot;Malassezia&quot; are found on the skin of animals, including humans. Because malassezia requires fat to grow, it is most common in areas with many sebaceous glandson the scalp, face, and upper part of the body.

== Role in human diseases ==

&quot;Malassezia&quot; infections of human skin can cause or aggravate a variety of conditions, including dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and acne.

=== Dermatitis and dandruff ===

When &quot;Malassezia&quot; grows too rapidly, the natural renewal of cells is disturbed, and dandruff can appear with itching (a similar process may also occur with other fungi or bacteria).

Identification of &quot;Malassezia&quot; on skin has been aided by the application of molecular or DNA-based techniques. These investigations show that the &quot;M. globosa&quot; is the species that causes most skin disease in humans, and that it is the most common cause of dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis (though &quot;M. restricta&quot; is also involved).

There can be as many as ten million &quot;M. globosa&quot; organisms on a human head.

A project in 2007 sequenced the genome of dandruff-causing &quot;Malassezia globosa&quot; and found it to have 4,285 genes. &quot;M. globosa&quot; uses eight different types of lipase, along with three phospholipases, to break down the oils on the scalp. Any of these 11 proteins would be a suitable target for dandruff medications. 

Prescription and over-the-counter shampoos containing ketoconazole are commonly used to treat dandruff caused by &quot;Malassezia&quot;.

&quot;M. globosa&quot; has been predicted to have the ability to reproduce sexually, but this has not been observed.

===Skin pigmentation disorders===
In occasional opportunistic infections of the trunk and other locations on humans, some species of &quot;Malassezia&quot; can cause hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation. Allergy tests for these fungi are available.

The skin rash of tinea versicolor (&quot;pityriasis versicolor&quot;) is also caused by an infection of this fungus.

=== Cancer ===

Translocation of &quot;Malassezia&quot; species from the intestines into pancreatic neoplasms has been associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the fungi may promote tumor progression through activation of host complement.

===Crohn&#x27;s and inflammatory bowel disease===

&quot;M. restricta&quot;, which is normally found in the skin, is linked to disorders like Crohn&#x27;s disease and inflammatory bowel disease when found in the gut. This is especially true for organism with the N12 CARD9 allele, which provokes a stronger inflammatory response.

===Malassezia folliculitis===

&quot;Malassezia folliculitis&quot; (also called &quot;pityrosporum folliculitis&quot;) is caused by infection with &quot;Malassezia&quot;.
==Systematics==

&quot;Malassezia&quot; is the sole genus in family Malasseziaceae, which is the only family in order Malasseziales, itself the single member of class Malasseziomycetes. 

Due to progressive changes in their nomenclature, some confusion exists about the naming and classification of &quot;Malassezia&quot; yeast species. Work on these yeasts has been complicated because they require specific growth media and sometimes grow very slowly in laboratory culture.

&quot;Malassezia&quot; was originally identified by the French scientist Louis-Charles Malassez in the late nineteenth century; he associated it with the condition seborrhoeic dermatitis. Raymond Sabouraud identified a dandruff-causing organism in 1904 and called it &quot;Pityrosporum Malassezii&quot;, honoring Malassez, but at the species level as opposed to the genus level. When it was determined that the organisms were the same, the term &quot;Malassezia&quot; was judged to possess priority.

In the mid-twentieth century, it was reclassified into two species:
* &quot;Pityrosporum (Malassezia) ovale&quot;, which is lipid-dependent and found only on humans. &quot;P. ovale&quot; was later divided into two species, &quot;P. ovale&quot; and &quot;P. orbiculare&quot;, but current sources consider these terms to refer to a single species of fungus, with &quot;M. furfur&quot; the preferred name.
* &quot;Pityrosporum (Malassezia) pachydermatis&quot;, which is lipophilic but not lipid-dependent. It is found on the skin of most animals.

&quot;Malassezia&quot; is the sole genus in the family Malasseziaceae, which was validated by Cvetomir Denchev and Royall T. Moore in 2009. The order Malasseziales had been previously proposed by Moore in 1980, and later emended by Begerow and colleagues in 2000. At this time the order was classified as a member of unknown class placement in the subdivision Ustilaginomycotina. In 2014, Cvetomir and Teodor Denchev circumscribed the class Malasseziomycetes to contain the group.

==Description==
&quot;Malassezia&quot; grows rapidly, typically maturing within 5 days when incubated at temperatures ranging from . Growth is slower at , and certain species struggle at . These organisms can proliferate on media infused with cycloheximide. An essential factor for the growth of &quot;Malassezia&quot; is the presence of long-chain fatty acids, with &quot;M. pachydermatis&quot; being an exception. The most conventional cultivation method involves overlaying solid media with a layer of olive oil. However, for nurturing some clinically relevant species, such as the challenging-to-cultivate &quot;M. restricta&quot;, more intricate culture media may be required. For the most efficient recovery of &quot;Malassezia&quot;, it has been recommended to collect blood through a lipid infusion catheter and subsequently use lysis-centrifugation—a recommendation backed by multiple comparative studies.

The yeast-like cells of &quot;Malassezia&quot;, measuring between 1.5–4.5 μm by 3–7 μm, are characterised as phialides featuring tiny collarettes (a small, collar-like flange or lip at the mouth of a phialide from which spores or conidia are produced and released). These collarettes are challenging to identify using standard light microscopes. A defining characteristic of cells from this genus is their morphology: one end is round, while the other has a distinctly blunt termination. This latter end is where singular, broad-based bud-like structures emerge, although in certain species, these structures might be narrower. To effectively visualise the organism&#x27;s shape, a staining technique involving safranin is recommended, followed by observation under oil immersion. Furthermore, Calcofluor-white staining provides an enhanced clarity of the cell wall and its unique contour. While &quot;Malassezia&quot; typically lacks hyphal elements, rudimentary forms can sporadically be present.

==Species==
The &quot;Index Fungorum&quot; lists 22 species of &quot;Malassezia&quot;. The following list gives the name, the taxonomic authority (those who first described the fungus, or who transferred it into &quot;Malassezia&quot; from another genus; standardized author abbreviations are used), and the name of the organism from which the fungus was isolated, if not human.

In the mid-1990s, scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, discovered additional species.

<doc id="967641" wikidata="Q960939" url="?curid=967641" title="Rafael Osuna">
<text>Rafael Osuna Herrera (15 September 1938 – 4 June 1969), nicknamed &quot;El Pelón&quot; (The Bald), was a former world No. 1 tennis player, the most successful player in the history of Mexico and an Olympian. He was born in Mexico City, and is best remembered for his singles victory at the U.S. Open Championships in 1963, winning the 1960 and 1963 Wimbledon Doubles championships, the 1962 U.S. Open Championships doubles, and for leading Mexico to its only Davis Cup Final round appearance in 1962. He is the only Mexican to date to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, in 1979.

== Career ==
His first successes as an athlete occurred before he was ten years old, when he competed in the open category of the Mexican National Table Tennis Championships. In the course of the tournament, he upset the Mexico City Table Tennis Champion in singles, a feat remarkable both for Osuna&#x27;s young age and the fact that it was his first tournament. Osuna also won the Doubles Championship, with Alfredo Ramos Uriarte as his partner. From age 10 to 14 he was ranked in the top 10 in Mexico&#x27;s Open singles in table tennis.

He was awarded a full scholarship to attend the University of Southern California (USC) in the US, by Head Coach George Toley, who quickly identified Osuna as a major talent. Toley had to literally reteach Osuna how to play tennis because of his poor technique but, in Toley&#x27;s own words ¨he moves on the tennis court like a God¨. Osuna participated in the 1960 Wimbledon championships, competing only in the doubles category with Dennis Ralston (soon to be his roommate at school). The two unknown youngsters soon made history, as the first unseeded pair to win the men&#x27;s doubles at Wimbledon.

This victory marked the beginning of Osuna&#x27;s career and fame. Described as an &quot;agile and cerebral player&quot; who &quot;moves on the tennis court with the grace of a panther&quot; (Tony Mottram), his subsequent achievements include:

* He is the only Mexican tennis player ever ranked World No. 1, in 1963, by the International Tennis Federation.
* He is the only Mexican tennis player ever to win a Grand Slam event singles title, the United States Tennis Association National Championships US Open Singles (1963). He is one of only three Latin Americans to win the US Championships, along with two Argentines Guillermo Vilas and Juan Martín del Potro.
* Osuna and Palafox are the only Mexican tennis players ever to win the US Open doubles title, in 1962.
* In 1962, as the leader of the Mexican Davis Cup Team, Osuna led the team to its only Davis Cup Final to date, which was also the first-ever final reached by a Latin American country.
* His last victory (two weeks before his death in a plane crash) was an almost single-handed defeat of Australia in Davis Cup competition; Osuna won both his singles matches and the doubles. At that time Australia had won the Davis Cup 17 times, and the defeat was considered a major upset.
* USTA National Hard Courts singles and doubles champion 1962 and doubles champion 1969.
* Osuna was NCAA singles champion in 1962, doubles champion from 1961 to 1963, and team champion in 1962–63. The 1963 USC tennis team is regarded by some as the best collegiate tennis team of all time.
* Osuna won Mexico&#x27;s only Olympic gold medals in tennis, in singles and in men&#x27;s doubles with Vicente Zarazua in 1968, though they were both exhibition events. In the simultaneously run demonstration event, Osuna reached the semifinals in the singles and won the doubles tournament (again alongside Zarazua).
* Osuna earned a Bachelor in Science in Business Administration from the University of Southern California in 1963. In that same year, the International Tennis Federation would declare him the year-end No. 1 player in the world.

== Playing style ==
Osuna was known for his footspeed, touch, and tactical awareness. Commentator Bud Collins dubs him &quot;Mexico&#x27;s greatest player...Ubiquitous on court, confusing to foes, ever seeking the net&quot;. His U.S. Open victory came against big server Frank Froehling, a dangerous unseeded opponent who had upset top-seeded Roy Emerson in the semifinals. Collins describes Osuna&#x27;s victory as a triumph of tactical play:

He is also remembered by his bold strategy against Bill Bowrey on the 4th match of the Mexico vs Australia Davis Cup tie in 1969. Coming back after the obligatory break after three sets (Osuna leading 2 sets to one), after holding serve on the first game, Osuna hits out, going for the lineas and keeping the ball away from Bowrey on each of all his service returns. While the knowledgeable public interprets this actions as trying to get loose, as the match progresses the public is baffled by Osuna continuing to do so after holding serve. Then, after holding serve and going up 4–3, Osuna changes his manner of play drastically by chipping in his return low to his opponents feet. At this precise moment Bowrey, in the entire 4th set and coming out of the rest period, has not hit one volley after his service motion due to the ¨hitting out¨strategy that Osuna implemented on this set. Bowrey is startled by the change of strategy on the first point. Osuna plays a superb second point to go up 0-30. Being love – 30 gets Bowrey extremely tight and gets broken. Osuna closes the match on his next service game.

== 1968 Olympic Summer Games ==
Osuna competed for Mexico in tennis at the 1968 Summer Olympics, which was a demonstration sport with no medals awarded. He finished in first place in three events:
* Demonstration events – Men&#x27;s doubles (with Vicente Zarazúa)
* Exhibition events – Men&#x27;s singles
* Exhibition events – Men&#x27;s doubles (with Vicente Zarazúa)

According to ESPN Latin America, Osuna&#x27;s latest achievements such as reaching the World No. 1 and winning the US Open in 1963 were highly influential factors for the organizers to create a tennis event for the Olympics.

;Demonstration events (Guadalajara)
;Exhibition events (Mexico City)
== Death and Family==
Osuna was one of 79 people killed in the crash of Mexicana de Aviación Flight 704 on 4 June 1969 near Monterrey, Nuevo León, &quot;Pico del Fraile&quot;, Tres Cerros. He was 30 years old. He left behind a wife, Leslie, and a daughter, Claudia.

== Posthumous honors ==

Osuna has received numerous posthumous honors, including:

* During the 1969 National Championships, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association NCAA instituted the Rafael Osuna Sportsmanship Award, the first new award added since 1881. Given to the most outstanding college tennis player, the criteria for the award are competitive excellence, sportsmanship, and contribution to tennis.
* During the 1969 US Open Championships at Forest Hills, two months after his death, the US Open Committee declared 28 August to be Rafael Osuna Day, honoring the memory of the former champion. This was the first time the tournament had honored a tennis player in this manner.
* In 1969 the Chapultepec Club, the cathedral of Mexican tennis and home to the majority of its history, named its stadium &quot;Rafael Osuna&quot;.
* In 1972, with the intent to strengthen ties between the US and Mexico and to honor the memory of the only player ever to win the US Championships and the Mexican Open championships in singles, the &quot;Osuna Cup&quot; event was instituted. It is disputed annually by the official teams from both nations, and is the longest international tennis event played on Mexican territory, and the only one sanctioned by the USTA and the MTF.
* In 1970 Mr. Joseph F. Cullman, Honorary Chairman of the Board of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, presented to the Chancellor of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Ing. Javier Barrios Sierra, ten scholarships in the name of Rafael Osuna to be awarded to outstanding Mexican students.

* On 14 October 2006, the University of Southern California USC Hall of Fame Selection Committee selected Osuna to be inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame on May 5, 2007.

<doc id="967645" wikidata="Q785697" url="?curid=967645" title="Shogakukan">
<text>is a Japanese publisher of comics, magazines, light novels, dictionaries, literature, non-fiction, home media, and other media in Japan.

Shogakukan founded Shueisha, which also founded Hakusensha. These are three separate companies, but are together called the Hitotsubashi Group, one of the largest publishing groups in Japan and the world. Shogakukan is headquartered in the Shogakukan Building in Hitotsubashi, part of Kanda, Chiyoda, Tokyo, near the Jimbocho book district. The corporation also has the other two companies located in the same ward.

==International operations==
===In the United States===
Shogakukan, along with Shueisha, owns Viz Media, which publishes manga from both companies in the United States.

Shogakukan&#x27;s licensing arm in North America was ShoPro Entertainment; it was merged into Viz Media in 2005.

Shogakukan&#x27;s production arm is Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions (previously Shogakukan Productions Co., Ltd.)

In March 2010 it was announced that Shogakukan would partner with the American comics publisher Fantagraphics to issue a line of manga to be edited by Rachel Thorn.

===In Europe===
In Europe, manga from Shōgakukan and Shūeisha are published by local publishers such as Pika Édition, Ki-oon, Kana and Kazé for the French market, and Kazé, Carlsen, Egmont and Tokyopop for the German market. Shogakukan, Shueisha and ShoPro have established a joint venture named Viz Media Europe. Viz Media Europe bought in 2009 the French Kazé Group whose activities are mainly publishing manga and home video for the French and German market.

===In Southeast Asia===
The company has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Shogakukan Asia, with headquarter in Singapore. Besides producing popular titles in English such as &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Future Card Buddyfight&quot;, the company also partners with local creators such as Johnny Lau to publish comic series for distribution in Southeast Asia.

==New Manga Awards==
Shogakukan has awards for amateur manga artists who want to become professional. It allows people to either send in their manga by mail or bring it in to an editor.

==Genghis Khan controversy==

On February 15, 2018, &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; (&quot;Gekkan Corocoro Comic&quot;), a children&#x27;s magazine published by Shogakukan, had in its March issue a cartoon making fun of Genghis Khan, founder of the Mongol Empire. The comic showed a mischievous boy doodling juvenile things on pictures of famous people, such as a dog&#x27;s face on a picture of Albert Einstein. Genghis Khan was depicted with a crude rendering of male genitalia on his forehead. After some backlash, Shogakukan initially offered an apology addressed to the Mongolian Embassy in Tokyo on February 23, but that failed to mollify Mongolian expats in Japan, who regard Genghis Khan as a national hero.

On February 26, Mongolians and citizens of China&#x27;s Inner Mongolia autonomous region resident in Japan sent a formal letter of protest to Shogakukan, while some 90 demonstrators protested in front of company headquarters. Major bookselling chains Kinokuniya, Miraiya and Kumazawa pulled the publication off shelves after the Mongolian Embassy in Tokyo filed an official complaint with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In March 2018, Shogakukan issued another public apology, announced a national recall of the magazine and offered a refund to magazine patrons. CoroCoro Comic&#x27;s website also published an apology by Asumi Yoshino, author of the serialized manga &quot;Yarisugi!!! Itazura-kun&quot; which contained the controversial image.

<doc id="967647" wikidata="Q7252559" url="?curid=967647" title="Province of Bumbunga">
<text>The Province of Bumbunga () was an Australian secessionist micronation located on a farm at Bumbunga near Snowtown and Lochiel, South Australia, from 1976 until approximately 2000. Its founder and only ruler was a British monkey trainer, uranium prospector, and postmaster named Alec Brackstone.

In November 1975 the Australian Labor Party government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was dismissed under controversial circumstances by Governor-General John Kerr, the official governmental representative of Queen Elizabeth II. Brackstone, an ardent British monarchist, became alarmed by what he saw as a drift away from the Australian system of constitutional monarchy toward outright republicanism. To ensure that at least a portion of the Australian continent would always remain loyal to the British Crown, he declared his four-hectare property north of Adelaide to be the independent Province of Bumbunga on 29 March 1976, and appointed himself its governor-general.

Brackstone then set about attracting tourism by planting thousands of strawberry plants in the pattern of a huge scale model of Great Britain. He intended to conduct weddings on his property, during which soil from the appropriate British county would be sprinkled on the ground. Implementation was delayed when Australian customs authorities seized the soil Brackstone had imported from the UK, and the entire enterprise was scuttled when the strawberry fields perished during a drought.

In 1980 Bumbunga began issuing cinderella stamps portraying members of the British royal family (except Sarah Ferguson, whom Brackstone disliked). Later issues addressed anti-nuclear sentiments and other social causes while retaining the royal theme. Though worthless as postage, they became popular with philatelists and oddity collectors. Fifteen series of 5000 copies each were eventually produced.

In 1987 changes to Australian investment laws that reduced the attraction of philatelic investments led Brackstone to abandon his commercial operations, and Bumbunga slid into relative oblivion. In 1999 Brackstone was arrested and charged with possession of illegal firearms. His assertion of diplomatic immunity due to his status as Bumbunga&#x27;s sovereign was unsuccessful but, according to Brackstone, the charges were ultimately dropped nevertheless. In 2018 Brackstone was interviewed at his residence in Clare, South Australia, still claiming to be Governor of the province.

<text>A plafond (French for &quot;ceiling&quot;), in a broad sense, is a (flat, vaulted or dome) ceiling.

A plafond can be a product of monumental painting or sculpture. Picturesque plafonds can be painted directly on plaster (as a fresco, oil, tempera, synthetic paints), on a canvas attached to a ceiling (panel), or a mosaic.

As a decorative feature of churches and staterooms, plafonds were popular from the 17th century until the beginning of the 19th century. Designs of this period typically used illusionistic ceiling painting showing the architectural structure behind, strongly foreshortened figures, architectural details, and/or the open sky.

<doc id="967654" wikidata="Q63774115" url="?curid=967654" title="Bottling line">
<text>Bottling lines are production lines that fill a liquid product, often a beverage, into bottles on a large scale. Many prepared foods are also bottled, such as sauces, syrups, marinades, oils and vinegars.

Bottling lines usually include label application equipment, capping operations, date stamps, etc. Quality assurance verification equipemt is often included. 

==Beer bottling process==

Packaging of bottled beer typically involves drawing the product from a holding tank and filling it into bottles in a filling machine (&quot;filler&quot;), which are then capped, labeled and packed into cases or cartons. Many smaller breweries send their bulk beer to large facilities for contract bottling—though some will bottle by hand. Virtually all beer bottles are glass.

The first step in bottling beer is &quot;depalletising&quot;, where the empty bottles are removed from the original pallet packaging delivered from the manufacturer, so that individual bottles may be handled. The bottles may then be rinsed with filtered water or air, and may have carbon dioxide injected into them in attempt to reduce the level of oxygen within the bottle. The bottle then enters a &quot;filler&quot; which fills the bottle with beer and may also inject a small amount of inert gas (usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen) on top of the beer to disperse the oxygen, as oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. Finally, the bottles go through a &quot;capper&quot;, which applies a bottle cap, sealing the bottle. A few beers are bottled with a cork and cage.

Next the bottle enters a labelling machine (&quot;labeller&quot;) where a label is applied. To ensure traceability of the product, a &quot;lot number&quot;, generally the date and time of bottling, may also be printed on the bottle. The product is then packed into boxes and warehoused, ready for sale.

Depending on the magnitude of the bottling endeavor, there are many different types of bottling machinery available. Liquid level machines fill bottles so they appear to be filled to the same line on every bottle, while volumetric filling machines fill each bottle with exactly the same amount of liquid. Overflow pressure fillers are the most popular machines with beverage makers, while gravity filling machines are most cost effective. In terms of automation, inline filling machines are most popular, but rotary machines are much faster albeit much more expensive.

==Wine bottling process==
The process for bottling wine is largely similar to that for bottling beer, except wine bottles differ in volumes and shapes. Traditionally, a cork is used to provide closure to wine bottles. After filling, a bottle travels to a corking machine (&quot;corker&quot;) where a cork is compressed and pushed into the neck of the bottle. Whilst this is happening, the corker vacuums the air out of the bottle to form a negative pressure &quot;headspace&quot;. This removes any oxygen from the headspace, which is useful as latent oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. A negative pressure headspace will also counteract pressure caused by the thermal expansion of the wine, preventing the cork from being forced from the bottle. Champagnes and sparkling wines may further be sealed with a muselet, which ensures the cork will not explode off in transit. Alternative wine closures such as screw caps are available.

Some bottling lines incorporate a &quot;fill height detector&quot; which reject under or over-filled bottles, and also a metal detector.

After filling and corking, a plastic or tin capsule is applied to the neck of the bottle in a &quot;capsular&quot;. Next the bottle enters a &quot;labeller&quot; where a wine label is applied. The product is then packed into boxes and warehoused, ready for sale.
