<text>The common frog or grass frog (Rana temporaria), also known as the European common frog, European common brown frog, European grass frog, European Holarctic true frog, European pond frog or European brown frog, is a semi-aquatic amphibian of the family Ranidae, found throughout much of Europe as far north as Scandinavia and as far east as the Urals, except for most of the Iberian Peninsula, southern Italy, and the southern Balkans. The farthest west it can be found is Ireland. It is also found in Asia, and eastward to Japan. The nominative, and most common, subspecies Rana temporaria temporaria is a largely terrestrial frog native to Europe. It is distributed throughout northern Europe and can be found in Ireland, the Isle of Lewis and as far east as Japan.

Common frogs metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages — aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile, and adult. They have corpulent bodies with a rounded snout, webbed feet and long hind legs adapted for swimming in water and hopping on land. Common frogs are often confused with the common toad (&quot;Bufo bufo&quot;), but frogs can easily be distinguished as they have longer legs, hop, and have a moist skin, whereas toads crawl and have a dry &#x27;warty&#x27; skin. The spawn of the two species also differs, in that frog spawn is laid in clumps and toad spawn is laid in long strings.

There are 3 subspecies of the common frog, &quot;R. t. temporaria&quot;, &quot;R. t. honnorati&quot; and &quot;R. t. palvipalmata&quot;. &quot;R. t. temporaria&quot; is the most common subspecies of this frog.

==Description==
The adult common frog has a body length of . In addition, its back and flanks vary in colour from olive green to grey-brown, brown, olive brown, grey, yellowish and rufous. However, it can lighten and darken its skin to match its surroundings. Some individuals have more unusual colouration—both black and red individuals have been found in Scotland, and albino frogs have been found with yellow skin and red eyes. During the mating season the male common frog tends to turn greyish-blue (see video below). The average mass is ; the female is usually slightly larger than the male.


The flanks, limbs and backs are covered with irregular dark blotches and they usually sport a chevron-shaped spot on the back of their neck and a dark spot behind the eye. Unlike other amphibians, common frogs generally lack a mid-dorsal band but, when they have one, it is comparatively faint. In many countries moor frogs have a light dorsal band which easily distinguishes them from common frogs. The underbelly is white or yellow (occasionally more orange in females) and can be speckled with brown or orange. The eyes are brown with transparent horizontal pupils, and they have transparent inner eyelids to protect the eyes while underwater, as well as a &#x27;mask&#x27; which covers the eyes and eardrums. Although the common frog has long hind legs compared to the common toad, they are shorter than those of the agile frog with which it shares some of its range. The longer hind legs and fainter colouration of the agile frog are the main features that distinguish the two species.

Males are distinguishable from females as they are smaller and have hard swellings, known as nuptial pads, on the first digits of the forelegs, used for gripping females during mating. During the mating season males&#x27; throats often turn white, and their overall colour is generally light and greyish, whereas the female is browner, or even red.

These smooth-skinned frogs can grow to an average weight of 22.7 grams and length of seven to ten centimeters (2.8-3.9 in) with colors varying from gray to green, brown, yellow, or red and may be covered in blotches. The underbelly is white or yellow often with speckles.

==Habitat and distribution==
Outside the breeding season, common frogs live a solitary life in damp wetland niches near ponds or marshes or among long riparian grass. They are normally active for much of the year, only hibernating in the coldest months. In the most northern extremities of their range they may be trapped under ice for up to nine months of the year, but recent studies have shown that in these conditions they may be relatively active at temperatures close to freezing. In the British Isles, common frogs typically hibernate from late October to January. They will re-emerge as early as February if conditions are favorable, and migrate to bodies of water such as garden ponds to spawn. Where conditions are harsher, such as in the Alps, they emerge as late as early June. Common frogs hibernate in running waters, muddy burrows, or in layers of decaying leaves and mud at the bottom of ponds or lakes primarily with a current. The oxygen uptake through the skin suffices to sustain the needs of the cold and motionless frogs during hibernation.

Common frogs are found throughout much of Europe as far north as northern Scandinavia inside the Arctic Circle and as far east as the Urals, except for most of Iberia, southern Italy, and the southern Balkans. Other areas where the common frog has been introduced include the Isle of Lewis, Shetland, Orkney and the Faroe Islands. It is also found in Asia, and eastward to Japan.

The common frog has long been thought to be an entirely introduced species in Ireland, however, genetic analyses suggest that particular populations in the south west of Ireland are indeed indigenous to the country. The authors propose that the Irish frog population is a mixed group that includes native frogs that survived the last glacial period in ice free refugia, natural post-glacial colonizers and recent artificial introductions from Western Europe.

=== Genetic population structure ===
The common frog is a very widely distributed species, being common all throughout Europe and northwest Asia. The more peripheral subpopulations of common frogs are significantly less in number, as well as less genetically variable. There is a steep genetic decline when approaching the periphery of the common frog&#x27;s distribution range. Additionally, genetic differentiation of common frog subpopulations tends to decrease in relation to increasing latitude. The colder climates create a strong selective pressure favoring common frog populations able to behaviorally thermoregulate at a high degree.

==Conservation ==

=== Long-term impact of diseases ===
Of the many diseases affecting common frogs, one of the most deadly has been the Ranavirus, which has been responsible for causing declines in amphibian populations worldwide. Two of the main, and most deadly, symptoms caused by Ranavirus towards common frogs are skin ulcerations and hemorrhaging. Mortality rates associated with the disease are very high, in some events it is observed to be over 90%. Deaths caused by Ranavirus occur in all stages of common frog development and are concentrated mostly during the summer months. Overall, common frog populations affected by ranavirus experience consistent and substantial declines in population size. Recent metagenomics studies on common frogs from the United Kingdom have revealed widespread viral infections of Rana tamanavirus, a positive-sense RNA virus that is closely related to Tamana bat virus, as of yet no pathology or effect on life history traits have been observed.

=== Impact of urbanization ===
Due to the widespread nature of &quot;Rana temporaria&quot;, common frogs can make their homes in both urban and rural environments. However, many of the populations living in urban environments are subject to the detrimental effects of urbanization. The construction of roads and buildings – absolute barriers to migration – has stymied gene flow and drift between urban populations of common frogs, leading to lower levels of genetic diversity in urban common frog populations compared to their rural counterparts. Urban common frog populations also experience higher levels of mortality and developmental abnormality, indicative of forced inbreeding.

However, the common frog is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

== Diet ==

=== Juvenile ===
At metamorphosis, once the tadpole&#x27;s fore legs have developed, the frog does not feed for a short time. Recently metamorphosed juvenile frog mostly feed on small insects like Collembola (hexapods), Acarina (mites and ticks), and small fly larvae. &quot;Rana temporaria&quot; tadpoles, however, mostly feed on algae and decomposed plants, but once their hind legs develop, they become carnivorous.

=== Adults ===
The common frog takes its place as an unspecialized and opportunistic feeder wherever it is located. In other words, common frogs will consume whatever prey that is most available and easy to capture. This usually means that the common frog feeds by remaining idle and waiting until a suitable prey enters the frog&#x27;s domain of capture. As a corollary, this also means that the common frog&#x27;s diet changes depending on the season where the associated prey become the most abundant. In the summer, the common frog&#x27;s diet mostly consists of adult crane flies and the larvae of butterflies and moths. To a slightly lesser extent, common frogs will feed on woodlice, arachnids, beetles, slugs, snails, and earthworms. In addition, common frogs will typically feed on bigger prey as they become larger. Therefore, newly developed common frogs are limited to smaller insect prey, whereas larger frogs are able to consume a wide range of insects. Common frogs will hide in damp places, such as in the water, during the day, and at night, they will begin searching for food.

== Reproduction and mating patterns==

During the spring the frog&#x27;s pituitary gland is stimulated by changes in external factors, such as rainfall, day length and temperature, to produce hormones which, in turn, stimulate the production of sex cells – eggs in the females and sperm in the male. The male&#x27;s nuptial pad also swells and becomes more heavily pigmented. Common frogs breed in shallow, still, fresh water such as ponds, with spawning commencing sometime between late February and late June, but generally in April over the main part of their range.

=== Competition among males ===
Like its close cousin, the moor frog (&quot;R. arvalis&quot;), &quot;R. Temporaria&quot; does not exhibit territoriality which leads to lack of physical fighting among males. During breeding season, male common frogs undergo a period of a few days (less than 10 days) where they display rapid and frenzied breeding behavior, during which the purpose of the male is to quickly find and mate with as many female frogs as possible. Higher rates of mating success in males typically have longer thumbs than single males, which allows them to have a better grip on females.

=== Mating interactions ===
Around three years after being born, the common frog will return to its original site of birth and release a mating call. Males will be the first to arrive at the pond and await females as they enter. During this period of pre-female competition, the pond is significantly male dominant, and there is a large amount of intrasexual competition taking place. The shallow portion of the pond, which is more suitable for egg laying, is more predominantly occupied by the larger males. However, once the females arrive, this territoriality quickly dissipates and male-female amplexed pairs are free to migrate wherever in the pond. Additionally, once engaged in an amplexus, it is rare for single males to attempt to displace or &quot;take over&quot; the paired male.

It is also important to note the effect of size on a male common frog&#x27;s mating strategies. Smaller frogs, during the pre-spawning period get displaced from the shallow areas of the pond. Therefore, they circumvent this issue by searching for females on the land or in areas of the pond where they first arrive. Meanwhile, the larger frogs occupy the spawning site, where they encounter more amplexed pairs and therefore rely on their ability to displace amplexed males to secure a mate. However, the frequency of these takeovers is not consistent.

==Life cycle==
Female common frog clutch sizes range from a few hundred up to 5,000 eggs. Many of these eggs form large aggregates that serve to thermoregulate as well as protect the developing embryo from potential predators. By bunching the eggs together, it raises the temperature of the embryo compared to the surrounding water, which is important because the rate of tadpole development is faster in higher temperatures. Additionally, the eggs are typically laid in the shallower regions of the pond to prevent hypoxia-induced fatality of the embryos.

It normally takes 2–3 weeks for the eggs to hatch. Afterwards, common frog larvae group up into schools where they help each other feed off of algae and larger plants, as well as avoid predators. By June and July, most tadpoles will have metamorphosized, and the remaining time until winter is used to feed and grow larger. Only the largest frogs will survive the winter, which places a large emphasis on rapid development until then. In fact, a common frog&#x27;s rate of development correlates with temperature. In lower temperature regions, common frogs will hatch earlier and metamorphosize sooner than common frogs living in warmer climate regions. Sexual maturity occurs only after three years, and common frogs will typically live between six and eight years.

===Development in the presence of predators===
The presence of a predator in the early development of the tadpole has an effect on its metamorphosis traits. For instance, it can lead to a longer larval period and a smaller size and mass at metamorphosis. Once the predator is removed, the growth rate of the tadpole returns to, or even exceeds, baseline. This influence of predator threat is only significant during early tadpole development.

One of the common frog&#x27;s most pervasive predators is the red-eared slider (&quot;&quot;Trachemys scripta elegans&quot;&quot;), which is a very invasive species of turtle.

== Thermoregulation ==
As an ectotherm, the common frog is very reliant on temperature as it directly influences their metabolism, development, reproduction, muscle ability, and respiration. As such, common frogs at mid and high elevations have developed a unique set of strategies to survive in cold climates. In fact, it is due to the common frog&#x27;s ability to thermoregulate so effectively that the species has been able to become so pervasive across a multitude of environments and climates, living as far north as the Arctic Circle in Scandinavia, which is further north than any other amphibian in the region. Contrary to &quot;&quot;Lithobates sylvaticus&quot;&quot; (wood frogs), common frogs do not have the ability to freeze protect themselves by increasing their levels of blood glucose to serve as a cryoprotectant. As a result, common frogs must rely on behavioral thermoregulation by seeking out warm microhabitats (such as in the soil or between rocks) during wintertime. Additionally, common frogs will commonly hibernate throughout the winter season in groups to provide bodily heating.

== Social behavior ==
Similar to other anuran species (&quot;Bufo americanus&quot; and &quot;Rana sylvatica&quot;), &quot;Rana temporaria&quot; are able to naturally discriminate others of its kind. Post-embryonic interaction with conspecifics is not necessary to induce associative behavior for common frogs as an adult. Rather, once common frog tadpoles have reached a certain age, they gain a strong innate associative tendency. &quot;Rana temporaria&quot; tend to aggregate as the result of environmental pressures, such as temperature or predators.
==Predators==
Tadpoles are eaten by fish, diving beetles, dragonfly larvae and birds. Adult frogs have many predators including storks, birds of prey, crows, gulls, ducks, terns, herons, pine martens, stoats, weasels, polecats, badgers, otters and snakes. Some frogs are killed, but rarely eaten, by domestic cats, and large numbers are killed on the roads by motor vehicles.

==Interactions with humans and livestock==
Common frogs have an important place in human ecology by controlling the insect populations. In particular, their consumption of mosquitos and other crop-damaging insects has been especially valuable. In addition, &quot;Rana temporaria&quot;, due to their ecological pervasiveness and relative abundance, have become a common laboratory specimen.

==Farming==
&quot;R. temporaria&quot; are farmed. Miles &quot;et al.&quot; 2004 provide improved ingredients for manufacturers of pellet food for farmed common frogs.

Due to the spread of diseases such as ranavirus, the UK based amphibian charity Froglife advised the public to avoid transporting frogspawn, tadpoles or frogs from one pond to another, even if these are close by. It has also been recommended not to place goldfish or exotic frog species in outdoor ponds as this could have a negative effect on the frog population.

<text>Fen Radio 107.5 was an Independent Local Radio station broadcasting from Church Mews, Wisbech in Cambridgeshire. While broadcasting as &#x27;Star Fens&#x27; the station also covered the Ely and Littleport areas as well, until the 107.1 frequency was taken over by Star 107.9 (Cambridge) – their sister station.

The transmission mast was on an old water tower at Friday Bridge near the B1101, south of Wisbech.

The station announced that it would cease broadcasting at the end of July 2008, with owners UKRD handing back the licence to regulators Ofcom. Fen Radio was the third station to do this, following their sister station Star Radio in Stroud and River FM in Livingston. Fen Radio closed down at 6pm on Thursday 31 July 2008, playing Survivor&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot; as their last song, which was also the first when the station launched on 3 October 1999.

<text>Eagle Radio was an Independent Local Radio station in the Surrey and North East Hampshire area of England. Based in Guildford in the Guildford College campus, Eagle Radio was part of the UKRD Group of radio stations.

==Launch==
Peter Gordon launched 96.4 The Eagle at 7:45a.m. on 4 January 1996, with the words &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve landed&quot;, an allusion to &quot;the Eagle has Landed&quot;, spoken by Neil Armstrong after the Apollo 11 mission had reached the surface of the Moon. The first song played was &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; by Billy Joel and the second song was &quot;Dreams&quot; by Fleetwood Mac.

==History==
The station changed its name from 96.4 The Eagle to 96.4 Eagle Radio in February 2007 and later changed to solely Eagle Radio. It launched on DAB Digital Radio on 12 December 2013.

Until 2018, Eagle Radio broadcast The Vodafone Big Top 40 chart show (previously The Pepsi Chart &amp; Hit40UK) which was produced from Capital FM in London and syndicated across over 140 commercial radio stations in the UK. However, the show was withdrawn from syndication in 2018 and now broadcasts solely on Heart &amp; Capital stations.

Sister stations eagle70s and eagle80s were launched on DAB in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

==Closure==
Eagle Radio was purchased by Bauer Media in 2019 along with other stations in the UKRD group. On 27 May 2020, it was announced that Eagle Radio would become Greatest Hits Radio from early September 2020. The station went through a transitional period where its playlist was changed over to the 70s, 80s and 90s era, and jingles changed to reflect the station playing &quot;greatest hits&quot;. Eagle Radio was finally rebranded to Greatest Hits Radio at 6:00am on 1 September 2020.

<text>Raymond Marcellin (; 19 August 1914 in Sézanne, Marne – 8 September 2004) was a French politician.
== Biography ==
The son of a banker, he studied law at the University of Strasbourg and the University of Paris. He worked as a lawyer for three years, before being called into the army in September 1939. He was captured by the Wehrmacht, but managed to escape and return to France. Thanks to Maurice Bouvier-Ajam, he found a position in the Vichy regime. His job was to diffuse the ideas of the Révolution nationale among youth and professional associations. He also taught at the University Jeune-France, a Vichy organization. For these services, he received the Order of the Francisque. Later, he joined the Résistance network Alliance of Marie-Madeleine Fourcade and Georges Loustaunau-Lacau. After the Libération, he was a gaullist candidate to the 1946 election in the Morbihan. However, he did not join De Gaulle&#x27;s RPF, and caucused with the independents.

He initially supported the socialist governments of Léon Blum (December 1946) and Paul Ramadier (January 1947), but voted against them on the statute of Algeria in autumn 1947. In 1948, he was vice-president of the &quot;Union démocratique des indépendants&quot; (democratic union of the independents). Starting 1949, He was both secretary general of &quot;Centre National des Indépendents&quot; caucus and adjoint general secretary of this party. On 11 September 1948 he was appointed under-secretary of the Interior under the socialist minister of the Interior Jules Moch in the government formed by the radical Henri Queuille. On 29 October 1949, Raymond Marcellin was appointed Commerce and Industry under-secretary in the government of Georges Bidault. After the departure of the socialists from the government on 7 February 1950 he became Commerce and Industry secretary. He then proceeded to close the &quot;Chambre des Métiers de la Seine&quot; that had been controlled by communists since the Libération. He also fired seven contractants holding key positions in the &quot;Centre National du Cinéma&quot; as they were either communists or belonged to the CGT, a labor union with close ties to the Communist Party. 

In 1951, during his reelection campaign, he was allied with the Mouvement Républicain Populaire, but not with the gaullist Rassemblement du Peuple Français. On this occasion, he declared that &quot;voting for the gaullists was taking the risk of sending communists to the Assemblée Nationale&quot;. He was reelected on 17 June 1951. On 8 March 1952 Raymond Marcellin was made Minister of Information in the government of Antoine Pinay. He introduced a minimal service on state radio and TV in case of strike. After December 1952, and the fall of the government of Antoine Pinay, Raymond Marcellin no longer held cabinet positions. Raymond Marcellin was supportive of the continuation of the war in Indochina, 
and did not vote for the Pierre Mendès-France government.

After being reelected in 1956, Raymond Marcellin did not support the socialist government of Guy Mollet. However, he approved Mollet&#x27;s policies in Algeria, and voted for giving special powers to the Army in the fight against Front de Libération Nationale on 12 March 1956. He regularly voted for the renewal of these special powers. He also supported the Suez intervention. However, he voted against the fiscal package of the Mollet government that was supposed to finance the war in Algeria. 
This led to the fall of the Mollet government. Raymond Marcellin continued to support the engagement of French troops in Algeria, and voted against Pierre Pflimlin that he suspected of trying to change French policy in Algeria. On 1 June 1958 Raymond Marcellin voted for the government of Charles De Gaulle, the last government of the fourth republic.

During the fifth republic, he was a member of the National Center of Independents and Peasants (CNIP) and then of the Center of Social Democrats (CDS). On 15 May 1962 Raymond Marcellin entered the government as Minister of Health. In 1965, he was elected mayor of Vannes, a position he would retain until 1977. Raymond Marcellin was made Minister of Industry from 8 January 1966 to 1 April 1967. Following the events of May 1968, he was appointed Interior minister of France on 30 May 1968 replacing Christian Fouchet. De Gaulle said on this occasion that with Marcellin he now had &quot;the real Fouché&quot;. To Marcellin, the demonstrators were either traitors or dupes of an operation of the Cuban secret services. He increased the police budget, and pledged to have all the necessary police force in Paris to establish order. He dissolved in 1968 the right-wing organization Occident, along with various Maoist groups. 

After De Gaulle resignation, in 1969, Raymond Marcellin was maintained at the ministry of Interior by the new president Georges Pompidou. On 4 November 1970 Raymond Marcellin, relying on a law of 16 July 1949 on the protection of youth, signed a degree banning display, publicity and sale to minors of Hara-Kiri Hebdo, following the publication of an issue of this satirical magazine with a cover titled &quot;Bal tragique à Colombey: 1 mort&quot; alluding disrespectfully to the death of Charles De Gaulle. In 1971, Raymond Marcellin tried to introduce a modification of the law of 1901 on freedom of association, which would have made preliminary administrative authorization necessary before being able to create an association. This modification was rejected by the constitutional council, after intense lobbying by former president Vincent Auriol. In the same year, Raymond Marcellin introduced an anti-wreckers bill (&quot;Loi Anti-Casseurs&quot;), that made a crime of attendance at a meeting where violence occurs. In 1973, the Trotskyist Ligue Communiste and right-wing Ordre Nouveau were banned on the same day after a violent confrontation between the two groups. 

Raymond Marcellin was forced to resign on 27 February 1974, after policemen of the Directorate of Territorial Security were caught red-handed planting microphones in the offices of &quot;Le Canard Enchaîné&quot;, an investigating newspaper. He was replaced by Jacques Chirac as minister of the interior, and became minister of Agriculture. He was then elected to the Senate on 22 September 1974. He remained a senator until 21 June 1981.

He served as president of the Regional Council of Brittany from 1978 to 1986.

<doc id="972591" wikidata="Q5254627" url="?curid=972591" title="Delta FM">
<text>Delta FM was an Independent Local Radio station, broadcasting to East Hampshire, South West Surrey and North West Sussex. The station provided local news, community information, and specialist music programming to the towns of Alton, Bordon, Four Marks, Haslemere, Hindhead, Liphook, Midhurst and Petersfield.

==Background==
The original Delta Radio first broadcast in January 1990. It was the brainchild of County Sound CEO, Mike Powell who successfully lobbied the Independent Broadcasting Authority for permission to put separate programming for the Haslemere district on what was originally intended to be a relay transmitter for Guildford&#x27;s County Sound. The station was launched by County Sound&#x27;s Terry Mann, formerly Programme Director of Radio 210, Reading.

After County Sound merged with Radio Mercury to form Allied Radio, Delta Radio was closed down by its new owners in 1992 and the transmitter went back to being a relay. However, when Mike Powell&#x27;s UKRD Group won the Guildford licence (after it came up for renewal), Delta Radio was relaunched in 1996. Wey Valley Radio had already been operating as a full-time service in nearby Alton and Four Marks since 1992. This station was launched as a &quot;community&quot; station by David Way and Paul Mann after years of campaigning for such a licence and a first test broadcast in 1991 from the offices of the Alton Herald as part of the Radio Cracker restricted service license. It was acquired by UKRD in 1994.

The decision to merge the two stations operationally was made in 1998 and the Wey Valley service was renamed Delta, and then in 2000, the Haslemere licence (which had previously been a part of the Surrey and North East Hampshire franchise) was merged with the Alton licence to finally form a single radio station.

Tindle Radio took over from UKRD as a major shareholder in the station in June 2003, a change which resulted in the closure of the Alton studios at Prospect Place, Mill Lane, with resulting consolidation at the Haslemere studios.

==Transmitters==
Due to the geographical conditions, Delta Radio used five transmitters to cover its transmission area, which broadcast on four separate frequencies. The 97.1 FM transmitter was situated at the Holy Cross Hospital in Haslemere and served Haslemere, Midhurst and the surrounding area.

Two transmitters operated on 101.6 FM. The first of these was situated in Medstead which is close to Four Marks. This transmitter covers the West of the Delta FM transmission area. The second operated from the Hindhead crossroads on the A3 and operated as an &quot;in-fill&quot; between the service areas of the 97.1 and 102 transmitters.

A transmitter on 101.8 served Petersfield and the surrounding area. This transmitter was added in 2003 after many years of campaigning. The final transmitter, on 102, operated from Holybourne near to Alton. This transmitter could be heard from Farnham to Four Marks and also covered Bordon.

==Closure==
On 29 April 2010, it was announced that Delta Radio would co-locate and merge with Kestrel FM in Basingstoke and share some programming. However, after the relocation, only a regional breakfast continued. After many weeks of trails announcing &quot;Kestrel is coming&quot;, Delta Radio was replaced by Kestrel FM at 9am on 3 June 2010.

<doc id="972593" wikidata="Q5177762" url="?curid=972593" title="County Sound Radio (1566 AM)">
<text>County Sound Radio was an Independent Local Radio station covering Surrey and north-east Hampshire in the United Kingdom. One of its closing forms in 2012–2014 formed Eagle Extra occupying 1566 MW following an internal split between older and newer music/features into two allied stations in 1988 and an incomplete takeover by Mercury FM then sale leaving a third station, that of Mercury, with enhanced coverage of this area and its successor Heart Sussex and Surrey. The post-1988 branch of the radio which was rooted in recent music, concerts and events in the area including for a younger audience alternated between three FM frequencies (96.6, 96.4 and 91.5); in 1996 it relaunched as 96.4 Eagle Radio.

== History ==
County Sound Radio was launched on 4 April 1983 by Frank Muir on 203 MW and 96.6 FM based at The Friary Shopping Centre in Guildford. In 1986, 96.6 changed to 96.4 FM.

It mainly used an FM transmitter on the Hog&#x27;s Back section of the North Downs west of Guildford. The AM transmitter, was next to the Portsmouth Direct Line in Farncombe, near Godalming.

===Programmes===
County Sound first aired weekdays 6am until 9pm, then until midnight. It went to 5am and/or 1am depending on day and schedule, before 24-hour service.

The original line-up included Phil Miles at Breakfast, Paul Owens, Sarah Lucas &quot;after lunch&quot; and Simon Cummings during the afternoon. Nigel Williams presented the evening show &quot;96.6&quot;.

It featured long news broadcasts, &quot;County World&quot;, at lunchtime and 6pm.

===Promotional mascot===
A costumed mascot was Brewster the Mouse who toured local fetes, funfairs and outdoor concerts.

===1988 to 1995===

On 1 June 1988, County Sound Radio used its FM and MW frequencies to create two stations, the first commercial station in the UK to do so.
#96.4 MHz became &quot;County Sound Premier&quot;, &quot;Premier Radio&quot; and then on 4 May 1992 a 102.7 Reigate and Crawley shared edition of &quot;Radio Mercury&quot;
#1476 kHz became &quot;County Sound Gold&quot;, later renamed &quot;First Gold Radio&quot; and then from 4 May 1992 a different County Sound originating from Crawley, West Sussex.

In 1989, the station moved most of its departments from its purpose-built studios on top of Guildford&#x27;s &quot;Friary Shopping Centre&quot; to a new building in Chertsey Road, Woking. A small facility remained in the Centre&#x27;s food court where shoppers could look directly into the on-air studio.

The FM frequences carried the West Surrey variant of Radio Mercury mainly programmed from the Friary Shopping Centre studio (Monday to Friday, 6am until 6.30pm). Weekend and overnight broadcasting came from Mercury&#x27;s Crawley HQ in Sussex. The Haslemere area received additional frequency 97.1FM, enabling its own show 7am-11am, interspersing the main hours of broadcast.

Since 1986, Mercury&#x27;s FM frequency changed from 103.6 to 102.7 as part of the UK-wide re-organisation of the VHF/FM band. 1989 saw a relay of the station added for the town of Horsham on 97.5. In 1991 the County Sound Radio Network was merged by owners Allied Radio in Guildford to form two brands Allied Radio plc.

Mercury then, having played a broad mix of music, became a mainly Top 40 hits station. County Sound&#x27;s AM frequency was later renamed &quot;Extra AM&quot; and then again was shortly renamed to &quot;Mercury Extra AM&quot; to make the connection between the two AM frequencies of both stations better known. It also joined with Southend based Essex Radio and became known as Breeze under DMGT owned Essex Radio Group. In 2000, the GWR owned Classic Gold Network took over the AM licence of 1521 kHz. On 102.7, Mercury was renamed &quot;Mercury FM&quot; after the takeover of the group by IRG who had also rebranded medium wave, Fame 1521, in 1995. Before that Mercury had lost County Sound and Eagle Radio took the Surrey 96.4 FM transmitter, and County Sound returned to 1476 AM.

From 1992, news magazine &quot;The South Tonight&quot; broadcast on weekdays at 6.30pm on Mercury and County Sound. The programme was presented from Crawley; the Guildford news team gathered and pre-edited news for the areas north-west of Sussex.

===1995 to 2011===

In 1995, the link between the Guildford and Crawley stations was broken, as Allied lost the Guildford licence. UKRD won the franchise - set to go on air in April 1996 - brought forward by seven months by agreement.

UKRD, led by Mike Powell, wanted to revive the station - and from 1 September 1995 it resumed broadcasting, as a skeleton service, on 96.4FM and 1476 AM to assist in a full launch.

On 29 December 1995, the station moved into Dolphin House, North Street, Guildford – ending twelve years at the Friary – and on 4 January 1996 the new UKRD stations launched, splitting frequencies: 
#1476 MW became County Sound in its original style
#96.4 became Eagle Radio appealing more to a younger audience.

In 1999, County Sound moved to its last frequency of 1566 MW. In its last years, the MW station became increasingly a jukebox with &#x27;Steve Dean&#x27; on a Sunday morning, and the main live presenter &#x27;Dave Johns&#x27; who both left before Christmas of 2011. Original presenter Simon Cummings died in December 1996 after suffering a long illness.

For 20 months from 2 April 2012, the older-track focus of station continued as &quot;Eagle Extra&quot; which relayed &#x27;The Peter Gordon Breakfast show&#x27; from Eagle Radio. In December 2014, its 1566 MW licence/bandwidth was sold to Premier Christian Radio which has become one of three relays of its London-HQ broadcasts.

<text>In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, two structures &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; of the same signature &quot;σ&quot; are called elementarily equivalent if they satisfy the same first-order &quot;σ&quot;-sentences.

If &quot;N&quot; is a substructure of &quot;M&quot;, one often needs a stronger condition. In this case &quot;N&quot; is called an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot; if every first-order &quot;σ&quot;-formula &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) with parameters &quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; from &quot;N&quot; is true in &quot;N&quot; if and only if it is true in &quot;M&quot;.
If &quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is called an elementary extension of &quot;N&quot;. An embedding &quot;h&quot;: &quot;N&quot; → &quot;M&quot; is called an elementary embedding of &quot;N&quot; into &quot;M&quot; if &quot;h&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot;.

A substructure &quot;N&quot; of &quot;M&quot; is elementary if and only if it passes the Tarski–Vaught test: every first-order formula &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, …, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;) with parameters in &quot;N&quot; that has a solution in &quot;M&quot; also has a solution in &quot;N&quot; when evaluated in &quot;M&quot;. One can prove that two structures are elementarily equivalent with the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games.

Elementary embeddings are used in the study of large cardinals, including rank-into-rank.

==Elementarily equivalent structures==

Two structures &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; of the same signature &quot;σ&quot; are elementarily equivalent if every first-order sentence (formula without free variables) over &quot;σ&quot; is true in &quot;M&quot; if and only if it is true in &quot;N&quot;, i.e. if &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; have the same complete first-order theory.
If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are elementarily equivalent, one writes &quot;M&quot; ≡ &quot;N&quot;.

A first-order theory is complete if and only if any two of its models are elementarily equivalent.

For example, consider the language with one binary relation symbol &#x27;&lt;&#x27;. The model R of real numbers with its usual order and the model Q of rational numbers with its usual order are elementarily equivalent, since they both interpret &#x27;&lt;&#x27; as an unbounded dense linear ordering. This is sufficient to ensure elementary equivalence, because the theory of unbounded dense linear orderings is complete, as can be shown by the Łoś–Vaught test.

More generally, any first-order theory with an infinite model has non-isomorphic, elementarily equivalent models, which can be obtained via the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem. Thus, for example, there are non-standard models of Peano arithmetic, which contain other objects than just the numbers 0, 1, 2, etc., and yet are elementarily equivalent to the standard model.

==Elementary substructures and elementary extensions==

&quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure or elementary submodel of &quot;M&quot; if &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are structures of the same signature &quot;σ&quot; such that for all first-order &quot;σ&quot;-formulas &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) with free variables &quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and all elements &quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;n of &quot;N&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;n) holds in &quot;N&quot; if and only if it holds in &quot;M&quot;:
formula_1

This definition first appears in Tarski, Vaught (1957). It follows that &quot;N&quot; is a substructure of &quot;M&quot;.

If &quot;N&quot; is a substructure of &quot;M&quot;, then both &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; can be interpreted as structures in the signature &quot;σ&quot;&quot;N&quot; consisting of &quot;σ&quot; together with a new constant symbol for every element of &quot;N&quot;. Then &quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot; if and only if &quot;N&quot; is a substructure of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are elementarily equivalent as &quot;σ&quot;&quot;N&quot;-structures.

If &quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot;, one writes &quot;N&quot; formula_2 &quot;M&quot; and says that &quot;M&quot; is an elementary extension of &quot;N&quot;: &quot;M&quot; formula_3 &quot;N&quot;.

The downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem gives a countable elementary substructure for any infinite first-order structure in at most countable signature; the upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem gives elementary extensions of any infinite first-order structure of arbitrarily large cardinality.

==Tarski–Vaught test==

The Tarski–Vaught test (or Tarski–Vaught criterion) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a substructure &quot;N&quot; of a structure &quot;M&quot; to be an elementary substructure. It can be useful for constructing an elementary substructure of a large structure.

Let &quot;M&quot; be a structure of signature &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;N&quot; a substructure of &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;N&quot; is an elementary substructure of &quot;M&quot; if and only if for every first-order formula &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;1, …, &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;) over &quot;σ&quot; and all elements &quot;b&quot;1, …, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot; from &quot;N&quot;, if &quot;M&quot; formula_4 &quot;x&quot; &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, …, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;), then there is an element &quot;a&quot; in &quot;N&quot; such that &quot;M&quot; formula_4 &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;1, …, &quot;b&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

==Elementary embeddings==

An elementary embedding of a structure &quot;N&quot; into a structure &quot;M&quot; of the same signature &quot;σ&quot; is a map &quot;h&quot;: &quot;N&quot; → &quot;M&quot; such that for every first-order &quot;σ&quot;-formula &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, …, &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and all elements &quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;n of &quot;N&quot;, 
:&quot;N&quot; formula_4 &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1, …, &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;) if and only if &quot;M&quot; formula_4 &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;1), …, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;)).
Every elementary embedding is a strong homomorphism, and its image is an elementary substructure.

Elementary embeddings are the most important maps in model theory. In set theory, elementary embeddings whose domain is &quot;V&quot; (the universe of set theory) play an important role in the theory of large cardinals (see also Critical point).

<text>Nikolskoye (; ) is a rural locality (a &quot;selo&quot;) and the administrative center of Aleutsky District of Kamchatka Krai, Russia, located on Bering Island in the Commander Islands chain. Population: It is the only remaining inhabited locality in the district.

==History==
It was founded in 1826 by Aleut (Unangan) settlers from Atka Island in the Aleutian Islands who were brought there by Russian fur traders. While engaging to some extent in the traditional pursuits of whaling and sealing with harpoons and spears, they were primarily employed in the harvest of fur-bearing animals, notably sea otters and fur seals.

==Demographics==
Currently, the population is divided roughly evenly between Russians and Aleuts, but mixing between the two is common.

==Economy==
The current economy is based primarily on fishing, especially the harvest of salmon caviar, mushroom gathering, and government services and subsidies. Despite living in an environment that is extremely rich with wildlife, the inhabitants of the island are very restricted in the use of these resources since almost the entire island is a nature preserve. In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, poaching of fish, Arctic fox, reindeer (which were introduced to the island), and migratory waterfowl was widespread, but there is virtually no harvest of marine mammals due to strict protection.

==Transportation==
Nikolskoye is served by the Nikolskoye Airport.

==Climate==
Like the rest of Kamchatka Krai, Nikolskoye has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), though the ocean makes temperatures much less extreme than interior Siberia, with winters being about four degrees milder than in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. The transition to the subpolar oceanic climate of southwest Alaska to the east is very apparent, especially in the extremely low sunshine hours, which average only around 2.8 per day due to the consistent fog from the Aleutian Low and the Oyashio Current on its western flank.
Extreme temperatures have ranged from , with the latter occurring as recently as June 30, 1938.

==Religion==
The first church of Nikolskoye was dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Innocent of Irkutsk, the Enlightener of Siberia. It was built in 1799 by the Russian-American Company. The second building was dedicated in the 1890s and closed after the October Revolution. It was then used as a local club, then a hostel. The building burned down in 1983. A new church was built in the center of the village, a location not subject to tsunamis. It was built in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, dismantled, shipped to the island and reassembled in September 2012.

<text>Erhard&#x27;s wall lizard (&quot;Podarcis erhardii)&quot;, also commonly called the Aegean wall lizard, is a species of lizard in the family Lacertidae. The species is endemic to Southeast Europe.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;erhardii&quot;, is in honor of a certain Dr. D. Erhard (first name unknown), a German naturalist, who was the author of &quot;Fauna der Cycladen&quot; (1858).

==Geographic range==
&quot;P. erhardii&quot; is found in the Balkan peninsula and the Aegean islands. On the mainland it ranges from Albania, North Macedonia, extreme southern Serbia and southern Bulgaria to the northeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. In the Aegean archipelago it does not occur in Milos or the surrounding islands, where it is replaced by the Milos wall lizard.

==Description==

The snout-to-vent length (SVL) of &quot;P. erhardii&quot; is about , and the tail is twice as long. The head is rather wide, and the skin is smooth. The colour and patterning of this species vary a lot. The main colour is typically grey or brown, sometimes green. Females particularly are often striped. On the edges of the back two white stripes border two dark stripes or spotty lines. In the middle of the back may be a dark line. Some males have net-like patterning, where longitudinal and transverse lines and spots mix. The belly and often throat are white, yellow, orange or red, and in the Aegean Islands also green, blue or grey. The belly is never spotty, but sometimes there are blue spots on the hind legs.

==Habitat==
Erhard&#x27;s wall lizard lives in dry or rocky places with dense, low bushes. It climbs very well. The lizard populations in the Aegean archipelago inhabit open places, like plant-covered dunes, as well.

==Diet==
Erhard&#x27;s wall lizard eats arthropods, especially insects.

==Reproduction==
&quot;P. erhardii&quot; mates in spring, and lays eggs at the beginning of the summer. The young lizards hatch in September, then measuring .

==Behaviour==
&quot;P. erhardii&quot; chooses backgrounds that match its colour to enhance camouflage against avian predators in its natural habitat.

==Subspecies==
Although 28 subspecies of &quot;P. erhardii&quot; have been described and considered valid, &amp; (2008) consider only four subspecies to be valid, including the nominotypical subspecies.
*&quot;Podarcis erhardii erhardii&quot; 
*&quot;Podarcis erhardii livadiacus&quot; 
*&quot;Podarcis erhardii riveti&quot; 
*&quot;Podarcis erhardii thessalicus&quot; 
*&quot; Podarcis erhardii ruthvenii&quot; 
&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Podarcis&quot;.

<text>The Top 14 () is a professional rugby union club competition that is played in France. Created in 1892, the Top 14 is at the top of the national league system operated by the France National Rugby League, also known by its French initialism of LNR. There is promotion and relegation between the Top 14 and the next level down, the Pro D2. The fourteen best rugby teams in France participate in the competition, hence the name Top 14. The competition was previously known as the Top 16.

The league is one of the three major professional leagues in Europe (along with the English Premiership and the United Rugby Championship, which brings together top clubs from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy and South Africa), from which the most successful teams go forward to compete in the European Rugby Champions Cup, the championship which replaced the Heineken Cup after the 2013–14 season.

The first ever final took place in 1892, between two Paris-based sides, Stade Français and Racing Club de France, which were the only teams playing the competition that year, with the latter becoming the inaugural champions. Since then, the competition has been held on an annual basis, except from 1915 to 1919—because of World War I—and from 1940 to 1942—because of World War II. Each year, the winning team is presented with the Bouclier de Brennus, a famous trophy awarded from 1892. Toulouse is the most successful club in the competition with 23 titles.

==History==

=== Early years ===
Football was introduced in France by British traders and workers around the 1870s. The first known club to have practiced a form of football was the Havre Athletic Club in 1872, playing an hybrid code called the &quot;combination&quot;. The first true club to have played rugby union was the English Taylors RFC in 1877, followed by the Paris Football Club in 1878. In the idea to copy the British model of public school, a lot of students&#x27; clubs appeared as well to practice athleticism and rugby, like the Racing Club de France (creation of Lycée Condorcet students in 1882), the Stade Français (creation of Lycée Saint-Louis students in 1883) and the Olympique (creation of Lycée Michelet (Vanves) students in 1887). At the same time, rugby was also introduced via the port of Bordeaux to south-western France, and quickly merged with popular local traditions of ball games.

Arbitrated by Pierre de Coubertin, the first title of French champion was decided by a single match, between the Racing Club de France and Stade Français, on 20 March 1892. Racing won the match 4–3. This embryonic league was played between only Parisian teams, and no more than six of them, until 1898. Stade Français won five titles, and lost one final to Olympique in this early stage of the league.

The 1898–99 season saw a change in the format of the championship. The champion of Paris now met in a final for the national title the champion of &quot;la province&quot; (the rest of France). That changed again in 1904 with the creation of 16 regional leagues, the champions of which were qualified for a round of 16. The championship, now truly on a national scale, saw the emergence of the first true dynasty of French rugby, with the domination of Stade Bordelais, who played 12 of the 13 finals between 1899 and 1911, winning seven of them. The club&#x27;s reign was stopped by three consecutive eliminations in semi-finals, and other south-western cities&#x27; clubs, like Perpignan, Bayonne and Toulouse, took charge of the sport.

=== After the First World War ===

Due to the war, league operations were suspended for a number of years. In its place, a competition known as the Coupe de l&#x27;Espérance was held, which involved mostly young boys who had not been drafted. The competition was held four times, but is not normally considered a full championship. The normal competition returned for the 1920 season, and Stadoceste Tarbais became the first post-war champions, defeating the Racing Club de France in the final.&lt;br&gt;
During the 1920s Stade Toulousain initiated its now famous rugby history, winning five Championships during the decade (Stade&#x27;s first feat took place in 1912 when they were crowned champions without losing a single game throughout the season: the team was nicknamed &quot;la Vierge Rouge&quot;—&quot;the Red Virgin&quot;, a reference to the club shirt color). USA Perpignan also won two championships (their 1925 final victory was actually a second match, as a previous final had ended in a nil-all draw).

The 1930 Championship final, won by Agen over US Quillan, was the first to go into extra time. The 1930s were dominated by the Biarritz Olympique (four finals and two championship titles) and the Lyon Olympique Université (three finals and two titles). However, those dominations were sour, because of extra-sportive turmoil that shook French rugby union in this decade. Brawls on the pitch and in the stand,s and disguised professionalism (nicknamed &quot;brown amateurism&quot;) had become quite common.

The most stunning example of brown amateurism was the Union Sportive Quillan, a club of a village of 3,000 residents who managed to advance to three finals and win one of them, because Jean Bourrel, the owner of the village hat factory, offered paid positions in his factory to rugby players; he wanted to use the club as an advertisement for his product. On 24 January 1931, 14 rugby union clubs, amongst them seven former French champions, seceded from the French Rugby Federation to protest against the abuses that had tarnished rugby union&#x27;s image in the country. Despite a reintegration of those club in 1932, this event had deep consequences.

The four British national teams decided after this incident to ban France from the Five Nations. Coupled with the effect of the economical crisis, the number of club affiliated to the FFR dropped, from 784 in 1930 to 558 in 1939. This crisis also quick-started rugby league in France, which went from no club existing in the country in 1934 to 225 in 1939, among them 14 fully professional.

=== During and after the Second World War ===

As during the First World War, the championship was suspended. Rugby union was one of the least affected sports by the German occupation, as it conformed to the amateur vision of sport cultivated by fascist ideology, and its location mainly in the unoccupied south meant that it was far removed from overly severe repression. The Vichy regime tried to turn rugby union into a kind of national amateur sport for all, by banning all professional sports in 1941, which dealt a terrible blow to association football and rugby league. In 1942, the rugby union league was reinstated, with Jean Dauger&#x27;s Bayonne, Puig-Aubert&#x27;s USA Perpignan and Albert Ferrasse and Guy Basquet&#x27;s Agen among the big team.

Rugby union experienced a wave of growth after the war, thanks to the civilian population&#x27;s desire to forget the horrors of the conflict, France&#x27;s reintegration into the prestigious Five Nations and the return of clubs that had opted for rugby league before the war to the FFR fold, such as Béziers. The retention of a large number of teams in the championship (between 40 and 80 until 1991) also helped local identification with rugby. The 1940s saw the appearance of the Tarn department on the French rugby map, with double by Castres and a victory by US Carmaux, but above all the emergence of a new dynasty. With a core group of eight international players - Antoine Labazuy, Jean and Maurice Prat, Thomas Mantérola, Louis Guinle and Roger Martine - FC Lourdes contested 10 finals between 1945 and 1960, winning 7 titles. The 60&#x27;s were highly contested, with 8 different winner, including three SU Agen titles.

Lourdes were also the champions of the 1968 season, but due to the May 1968 events, the final was played three weeks behind the normal schedule. At the end of regulation time the score was tied at 6–6, and then 9–9 after extra time. Lourdes were declared champions because they had scored two tries to Toulon&#x27;s none and also because there was no time to schedule a third final as the France national team were about to leave on a tour to New Zealand and South Africa.

Although Béziers won their first championship in the 1961 season, it would be the 1970s which would bring a golden era for the club, under the command of the coach Raoul Barrière, as they would win ten championships between 1971 and 1984, as well as being runners-up in 1976. The club also established a lot of records : a 100–0 win against Montchanin in September 1975, a home undefeated streak lasting 11 years and 9 months, and five entire undefeated seasons (1961, 1971, 1972, 1975, 1978). In the mid-1970s, after being held in Toulouse, Lyon and Bordeaux, the final was fixed on a permanent basis to the newly reconstructed Parc des Princes in Paris.

A former number eight of the club in the 60&#x27;s, and a high school and university teacher, Daniel Herrero was named as head coach of RC Toulon in 1983. He transformed the RCT, going unbeaten for seven years at home and appearing in three finals, winning in 1987. The club&#x27;s main opponent was the resurgent Stade Toulousain, with a generation nicknamed &quot;the gymnastics professor team&quot;, because of the job held by eight of them. Toulouse won the title in 1989, the tenth in its history. The first match of the 1990s went into extra time, as the Racing Club de France defeated Agen, winning their first Championship since 1959. Bègles, Toulon, Castres and Toulouse would win the following finals.

The decade saw the league move increasingly toward professionalism, with a reduction of the number of teams authorized to play in the elite from 40 in 1995 to 16 in 2001.

=== Professional era ===

The 15 first years of the newly professional league were dominated by three teams. Including their 1994 and 1995 victories, Toulouse won four championships in succession, and three others in 1999, 2001 and 2008.&lt;br&gt; Biarritz won in 2002 its first title since 1939, then two others in 2005 and 2006, with a core of players like Marc and Thomas Lièvremont, Joe Roff and Dimitri Yachvili. But the team who benefited the most from professionalism was Stade Français. After experiencing success at the beginning of the sport, this club had long been stuck in the lower divisions of French rugby. Bought by Max Guazzini, the owner of the successful radio station NRJ, the club came back with a core of young and exciting players coached by Bernard Laporte to claim five titles between 1998 and 2007.

Encouraged by the Stade Français experience, other wealthy individuals invested in Top 14 : Mohed Altrad in Montpellier, Mourad Boudjellal in Toulon, assembled teams of star to compete for the title. Those rich newcomers, however, did not completely topple the traditional teams. Since 2010, Toulouse, driven by its powerful academy, have won five titles, while Clermont and Castres, the two other teams to have never been relegated in the professional era, have each won two.

=== Rising popularity ===
The competition saw an enormous rise in popularity in 2005–06, with attendance rising to an average of 9,600, up by 25% from 2004 to 2005, and numerous sellouts. On 15 October 2005, Stade Français drew a crowd of 79,502 at Stade de France for their home match against Toulouse; this broke the previous French attendance record for a regular-season league match in &quot;any&quot; sport (including football) by over 20,000. That record was broken on 4 March 2006, when Stade Français drew 79,604 to a rematch of the 2004–05 final against Biarritz at Stade de France. It was broken again on 14 October 2006 with 79,619 as the same two opponents met, and a fourth time on 27 January 2007, with 79,741 for another Stade Français-Toulouse match. During the regular season 2010–2011, the average attendance per match reached 14,184. In 2011, Canal+ indicated that evening matches were being watched by between 800,000 and 850,000 viewers while afternoon matches were watched by around 700,000 viewers. In recent years, numerous foreign players have joined Top 14 teams.

=== Changes afoot ===

In August 2016, LNR released a strategic plan outlining its vision for French rugby through the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The plan includes significant changes to the top levels of the league system, although the changes were more dramatic for Pro D2 than for the Top 14. Changes affecting the Top 14 are:
* Starting with the 2017–18 season, the only club to be automatically relegated from Top 14 will be the bottom club on the league table. That club will be replaced by the Pro D2 champion.
* From 2017 to 2018, the second-from-bottom team on the Top 14 table will enter a playoff with the Pro D2 runner-up, with the winner taking up the final Top 14 place.

On 13 March 2017, the Top 14 was rocked by the announcement that Racing 92 and Stade Français planned to merge into a single club effective with the 2017–18 season. Stade Français players soon voted almost unanimously to go on strike over the proposed merger, and within days LNR held an emergency meeting to discuss the Paris clubs&#x27; plans. The clubs announced on 19 March that the planned merger had collapsed.

===Controversy===

The 1993 French Rugby Union Championship was won by Castres, who beat Grenoble 14–11 in the final, a match decided by an irregular try. A try by Grenoble&#x27;s Olivier Brouzet was ruled out and the decisive try by Gary Whetton of Castres was awarded by the referee, Daniel Salles, when in fact Grenoble scrum-half Franck Hueber had touched the ball down first in his try zone. This error gave the title to Castres. Salles admitted his mistake 13 years later. Jacques Fouroux, then coach of Grenoble, came into conflict with the French Rugby Federation after claiming the match had been fixed.

== Economic strength of the clubs ==

As of 2024, Top 14 income from TV rights was ahead of European peers.

In the years to 2010 the Top 14 saw the economic strength of its clubs rise significantly. Aided by high attendance, large television rights contracts, public subsidies and the rise of the euro exchange rate, Top 14 clubs have seen their overall spending budget increase significantly. In 2011–2012, four clubs had a budget over 20 million euros: Toulouse (33), Clermont (24), Racing Métro [now Racing 92] (22), Stade Francais (21).
The average salary of players in the Top 14 was estimated to have risen, in 2010, to $153,700 (compared to $123,000 in the English Premiership). The wealth of the Top 14 clubs has led them to attract a large number of international players, and to build teams with more strength in depth (in 2011, Top 14 clubs could have as many as 45 players, compared to 33 for Leicester Tigers, 2010 Premiership winner).

Two changes in regulation threatened to limit this economic growth. First, the French government repealed the law known as DIC (&quot;Droit à l&#x27;Image Collectif&quot;) on 1 July 2010. This law had allowed all member clubs in French professional sports organisations to treat 30% of each player&#x27;s salary as image rights. This portion of player salaries was thus exempt from France&#x27;s high payroll and social insurance taxes.

Second, to control the growth of club spending, the LNR introduced a salary cap in the Top 14 in the 2010–11 season. Under the provisions of the cap, team payrolls were limited to €8 million. This is in addition to an existing requirement that wage bills be no more than 50% of a team&#x27;s turnover. However, the €8 million cap was 5% greater than the highest official wage bill in the 2009–10 Top 14, and was well above the English Premiership&#x27;s then-current £4 million cap. For the 2011–2012 season, the LNR raised the salary cap to €8.7 million. Since then, the cap has risen still further, to €10 million starting in 2013–14 and continuing through 2015–16. Additionally, the cap now excludes youth players whose salaries are no more than €50,000.

At the same time as LNR announced the salary cap, it also announced new rules requiring a minimum percentage of French players on club rosters. Players qualifying under these rules, referred to in French as JIFF (&quot;joueurs issus des filières de formation&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;academy-trained players&quot;), must have been registered with the FFR for at least five years before turning 23, or have spent three seasons in an FFR-approved training centre before turning 21. Original plans were to require 50% JIFFs in 2010–11, but protests from leading clubs led to a reduction to 40% for that season. Initially, the 50% quota was to be met in 2011–12, and 60% in 2012–13, but a compromise with the clubs saw no change to the limit until 2013–14, at which time it increased to 55%. Additionally, effective in 2015–16, LNR was allowed to fine clubs that did not have a minimum of 12 JIFFs in their matchday squads. These regulations, however, do not consider eligibility to play for the France national team. For example, although the Armitage brothers (Delon, Steffon and Guy) all represented England internationally, they qualified as JIFF because of their tenure in Nice&#x27;s youth setup. On the other hand, recent France international Jérôme Thion, despite being a native and lifelong resident of France, did not qualify because he switched from basketball to rugby too late in his youth.

While the most visible critics of the change in policy were wealthy club owners such as Mourad Boudjellal of Toulon and Max Guazzini of Stade Français, concern had been growing in French rugby circles that some smaller clubs might fold completely. Bourgoin only avoided a bankruptcy filing in 2009 by players agreeing to large wage cuts, and Brive, whose 2009–10 wage bill was €7.2 million, announced that they would cut their budget by 40% for the 2010–11 season. Following the 2009–10 season, Bourgoin were denied a professional licence by LNR due to their ongoing financial issues, but the French Rugby Federation (FFR) reversed this decision on Bourgoin&#x27;s appeal. Montauban were relegated at the end of the same season after filing for bankruptcy.

By the 2012–13 season, the internationalization of the Top 14 had reached such a state that Irish rugby journalist Ian Moriarty, who has had considerable experience covering the French game, asked the rhetorical question, &quot;Has there ever been such a large disconnect between France&#x27;s club teams and the international side they are supposed to serve?&quot; He cited the following statistics from that season to make his point:
* Clermont and Toulon, who were set to play in the Heineken Cup final within days of Moriarty&#x27;s piece, fielded a total of eight France-qualified starters out of a possible 30 in their Heineken Cup semifinal matches. Of these eight players, only four were regulars in the France national team.
* During the 2012–13 Top 14, none of the top three points scorers were French, and only three of the top 10 try scorers were French.
* Of the players who made the most appearances in their respective positions during that season, only three (out of 15) were French.
* National team coach Philippe Saint-André suggested that several &quot;foreign&quot; players—meaning players who were born and largely developed outside the country—could make their debuts for France during the team&#x27;s 2013 summer tour. Moriarty specifically named five such players as potential Test newcomers.

While the JIFF policy worked on one level—the number of foreign players recruited into the Top 14 went from 61 for 2011–12 to 34 for 2014–15—clubs quickly found a way around the rules. Many clubs dispatched scouts to identify top teenage prospects in other countries, and then enrolled them in their academies to start the JIFF qualification process. For example, the 59 players in the 2015–16 Clermont youth squad included 17 from nine countries outside of France. A more fundamental problem was identified in 2015 by Laurent Labit, at the time backs coach of the club now known as Racing 92. In an interview with British rugby journalist Gavin Mortimer, Labit pointed out that France has no organized team sport in its educational system at the primary level—children must join an outside club in order to play sports. Only at age 15 do youths have the opportunity to attend special sporting schools, but places in such institutions are limited. In turn, this means that most young French players are technically well behind their counterparts in many other countries, most notably Commonwealth members and Ireland.

==Format and structure==
The Top 14 is contested by fourteen professional rugby union clubs throughout France. The domestic season runs from August through to June. Every club contests 26 games during the regular season – over 26 rounds of competition. For many years, the season was split into two-halves for scheduling purposes, with both halves scheduled in the same order, with the team at home in the first half of the season on the road in the second. However, this strict order has since been abandoned, although the season is still loosely divided into halves. Throughout the August–June competition there are breaks during the season, as there are also European club fixtures (from 2014 to 2015, Champions Cup and Challenge Cup) that are played during the rugby season, as well as the Six Nations Championship, in which many top French players are involved, as well as a few players from the other European powers. The schedule may be adjusted somewhat in World Cup years; this was especially true in the 2007–08 season, which ran up against the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France. That season, the Top 14 played on all of the Six Nations weekends and on some of the Heineken Cup weekends.

The Top 14 is organized by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which runs the professional rugby leagues within France (Top 14 and Pro D2). There is a promotion and relegation system between the Top 14 and Pro D2. Starting with the 2017–18 season, only the lowest-placed club in the table after the regular season is automatically relegated to Pro D2. The playoff champion of Pro D2 is automatically promoted, while the next-to-last Top 14 club and the playoff runner-up of Pro D2 play each other to determine which club will be in Top 14, and which will be in Pro D2 the following season. Starting with the 2009–10 season, the Top 14 knock-out stages consist of three rounds. The teams finishing third through to sixth in the table play quarter-finals, hosted by the No. 3 and No. 4 teams. The winners then face the top two seeds in the semi-finals, whose winners then meet in the final at the Stade de France (although the 2016 final was instead held at the Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain due to a scheduling conflict with France&#x27;s hosting of UEFA Euro 2016). In previous seasons, only the top four teams qualified for semi-finals. Unlike many other major rugby competitions (such as the Gallagher Premiership, Mitre 10 Cup, Currie Cup, and from 2009 to 2010 the Celtic League/Pro12), the Top 14 has traditionally held its semi-finals at neutral sites.

Regardless of the playoff format, the top six teams had qualified for the following season&#x27;s Heineken Cup in the final years of that competition, and since 2013–14 a minimum of six teams qualify for the European Rugby Champions Cup. Before the 2009–10 season, the seventh-place team also qualified if a French club advanced farther in that season&#x27;s Heineken Cup than any team from England or Italy. While the European qualification system was changed for 2009–10, the normal contingent of six Top 14 teams in the Heineken Cup did not change. The default number of French teams in the Champions Cup has remained at six, but the method for a seventh French team to qualify has changed from performance in the previous European season to a post-season playoff. For the inaugural Champions Cup in 2014–15, this playoff involved the seventh-place teams from both England and the Top 14; in future years, the same two sides will be joined by one Pro12 side.

Previously in the first phase of the then-Top 16, the teams were divided into two pools of eight. This was followed by a second phase, in which the eight highest-ranked teams played for semi-final spots and the bottom eight teams battled against relegation. In 2004–05, the top division consisted of a single pool of 16 teams, with the top four teams advancing to a knockout playoff at the end of the season to determine the champion. From 2005 to 2006 through 2008–09, the top division was run with a single pool of 14 teams, again with a season-ending four-team playoff. The single pool was retained for 2009–10, but the playoffs were expanded to six teams.

The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other major domestic competitions. Instead of a bonus point being awarded for scoring 4 tries in a match, regardless of the match result, a bonus point is awarded to a winning team that scores the equivalent of 3 tries more than its opponent (15 points). This system makes two scenarios that can be seen in the standard system impossible:
* A losing team earning two bonus points. (The &quot;offensive&quot; bonus point, linked to the number of tries scored, can only be earned by the winning team in France.)
* Either team earning a bonus point in a drawn match. (See above for the &quot;offensive&quot; bonus point. The &quot;defensive&quot; bonus point can only be earned by a losing team.)

For 2014–15, LNR further tweaked its bonus point system. The margin of defeat that allows the losing team to earn a bonus point was reduced from 7 points to 5.

==European competition==
The Top 14 serves as the qualification route for French clubs in European club competition. Starting with the 2014–15 season, Top 14 teams compete in the new European club rugby competitions—the European Rugby Champions Cup and European Rugby Challenge Cup. The Champions Cup and Challenge Cup replaced the previous European competitions, the Heineken Cup and Amlin Challenge Cup.

Under the new structure, the top six teams on the Top 14 table qualify directly for the following season&#x27;s Champions Cup. The seventh-placed team advances to a play-off for another Champions Cup place. In 2013–14, the play-off involved said Top 14 club and the seventh-placed club in the English Premiership. Initially, plans were for the play-off in subsequent years to also include two sides from Pro12 in the Celtic nations and Italy. Due to fixture clashes with the Top 14 season, the play-off that followed the 2014–15 season involved only one Pro12 side. Because the start of the 2015–16 European season ran up against the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the play-off was completely scrapped for that season, with the final Champions Cup place for 2016–17 instead awarded to the winner of the 2016 Challenge Cup.

In the Heineken Cup era, a minimum of six French clubs qualified for the Heineken Cup, with the possibility of a seventh depending on the performance of French clubs in the previous season&#x27;s Heineken Cup and Challenge Cup.

All Top 14 clubs that do not qualify for the Champions Cup automatically qualify for the Challenge Cup. This means that all Top 14 clubs will participate in European competition during a given season.

The French clubs have had success in the European competitions. The inaugural Heineken Cup, held in the 1995–96 season, was won by Toulouse, which would eventually claim five more championships (2003, 2005, 2010, 2021 and 2024). Brive won the second edition in 1997, then Toulon won three times in a row in 2013, 2014 and 2015. La Rochelle finally won the trophy on two occasions in 2022 and 2023, both finals against Leinster. In addition to the French success in the Heineken Cup and Champions Cup, the clubs in the lower European competitions have achieved similar results. The first four finals of the European Challenge Cup (1997–2000) were all-French affairs. Since then, six French clubs (Clermont in 2007 and 2019, Biarritz in 2012, Montpellier in 2016 and 2021, Stade Français in 2017, Lyon in 2022, and Toulon in 2023) have won this competition. The now defunct European Shield, a repechage tournament for clubs knocked out in the first round of the Challenge Cup that was played for three seasons in 2003–05, was won by a French team each time.

<doc id="972610" wikidata="Q1998921" url="?curid=972610" title="Head of the River Race">
<text>The Head of the River Race (HORR) is an against-the-clock (&#x27;processional&#x27;) rowing race held annually on the River Thames in London, England, between eights, other such races being the Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race, Women&#x27;s Head of the River Race and Veterans&#x27; Head of the River Race. Its competitors are, with a few experienced junior exceptions, seniors of UK or overseas competitors and it runs with the ebb tide down the 4.25 mile (6.8 km) Championship Course from Mortlake to Putney which hosts the Oxford and Cambridge head-to-head races usually between one and two weeks later.

The race was founded on a much smaller scale, in 1925, by Steve Fairbairn – an influential rower then rowing coach of the early 20th century, who transformed the sport into one involving today&#x27;s lengthier slides enabling conventional (Fairbairnized) racing shell propulsion.
==History==
The race was founded by the rowing coach Steve Fairbairn who was a great believer in the importance of distance training over the winter. &quot;Mileage makes champions&quot; was one of Fairbairn&#x27;s repeated phrases included in his four volumes on rowing coaching and in other correspondence. He devised the race while coaching at Thames Rowing Club to encourage this form of training and raise the standard of winter training among London clubs. He transformed the sport by introducing a full body and leg-drive catch and introducing sliding seats.

A race proposal meeting followed between the captains of the metropolitan (i.e. London) clubs, who received the idea with great enthusiasm, and it was agreed that the first race would be held on Sunday 12 December 1926. Despite the choice of day of the week, the race went ahead with 23 entries (21 started) at a cost of 5s per crew ().
&quot;&quot;So far the ARA were slumbering in sweet ignorance of the horrible fact that racing was taking place on a Sunday. So the Committee bravely fixed Sunday, 27th March as the date for the second race, but the publicity the event had received had drawn the attention of the ARA and at a meeting of the committee on February 19th a letter was read from the ruling body pointing out that it might be necessary to alter the date of the race as the ARA might pass a resolution banning racing on Sundays... The Head of the River Committee agreed to abandon the December race and row one annual race in March or thereabouts on Saturday afternoons&quot;.&quot;
With the future of the race agreed, the number of entrants steadily rose:

* 1927 — 41 entries, all tideway crews (except two from Jesus College, Cambridge);
* 1928 — 49 crews;
* 1929 — 60 crews;
* 1930 — 77 crews; 
* 1936 — 127 crews;
* ... up to 1939 — 154 crews.

There was no race in 1937 (there was no suitable tide on a Saturday and at that time organised competitive sport did not take place on Sundays) nor from 1940 to 1945 inclusive due to the second world war. The event was restarted in 1946 (naturally starting with a smaller number of entrants – 71 crews) and has taken place annually ever since, with the exceptions of 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2017 when the race was cancelled due to bad weather, and 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As of 2014, London RC have won the race most often, 14 times (all before 1979) followed by Leander Club (in Henley) 13 times. An overtly GB National Squad, usually its eight, have won the race 12 times. The GB National Squad men&#x27;s eight tends to compete the race and may enter under a temporary club of their choice or what is in any event the main non-international season rowing club where they train that year. Given these past combinations, crews that are partly the GB men&#x27;s eight have won the race more than 40 times. Overseas entries have claimed the top prize 4 times. The other categories pitch themselves at the top clubs around the UK and the overseas pennant is the main prize nationally only available to overseas winners of any rowing competition.

From 1979 onwards, due to the sheer volume of competitors and for reasons of safety on a relatively small area of river and riverside, the HORR Committee had at that point to impose a limit of 420 crews, which still exists today. Entries are typically required and accepted in January for overseas crews and in February for UK crews.

==Race format==

The race is only open to men&#x27;s eights and is considered to be the peak of the head race season — attracting the top UK crews as well as foreign clubs. Composite crews, drawn from more than one club or institution, are not permitted.

The Championship Course is that of the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race but, unlike the Boat Race, the Head of the River Race is raced on an ebb tide from Mortlake to Putney. The starting time for the race is different every year and depends on the tide — the first crew (winner from the previous year) starts the race the next year. Start time is usually about 2 hours after high tide and crews start at about 10 second intervals.

The record time of 16 min 28.4 s was set in 2023 by Oxford Brookes University, beating the 1987 record of 16 min 37 s set by the Great Britain National Squad.

The Race is usually held on the third or fourth Saturday in March each year, depending on tides and the date of the Boat Race. Usually the two events are held on separate days, although in 1987 and 1994, the Boat Race took place in the morning and the Head in the afternoon

Raced over the same course in eights are the Schools&#x27; Head of the River Race (SHORR) organised by Westminster School, the Women&#x27;s Eights Head of the River Race (WEHoRR) and Veterans&#x27; Head of the River Race organised by Vesta Rowing Club. In other boats on the same course are raced the Head of the River Fours (HOR4s) sponsored by Fuller&#x27;s Brewery, the Veterans&#x27; Fours Head of the River and the Scullers Head organised by Vesta RC. The Pairs&#x27; Head is run over a shorter course from Chiswick Bridge to Hammersmith Bridge. The Veterans&#x27; HOR and Pairs HOR sometimes race in the reverse direction if tides do not permit the usual arrangement.

The race has since at least 1990 seen an excess of crews wishing to enter so a few minimum race wins are imposed therefore sometimes for each category, and always for elite and senior categories.

==Trophies==

Medals are awarded to all 14 categories. Eight trophies are awarded for the fastest crews under these categories:

* &quot;Head of the River&quot; — bust of Steve Fairbairn, a Head pennant plaque are awarded to the club whose crew returns the fastest time.
* UK-only trophies:
* &quot;Vernon Trophy&quot; — Karl Vernon presented the first of the three location-based club trophies in 1954 and this is made from the melted-down silver of trophies he won in his own racing career. The trophy is a statuette of the oarsman Jack Beresford (five-time Olympic medallist). Awarded to the fastest club crew normally rowing &quot;on the Thames Tideway&quot;.
* &quot;Page Trophy&quot; — Presented by the Head of the River Committee in memory of J.H. Page and awarded to the fastest club crew normally rowing on the &quot;Thames or its tributaries but not on the Tideway&quot;.
* &quot;Jackson Trophy&quot; — instituted by members of Nottingham Britannia RC in 1950, originally as the prize for an annual &quot;County Eights&quot; event between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. In 1960 it was presented to The Head of the River Race as the trophy for UK clubs &quot;outside of the Thames basin&quot;; it was by then in the form of a mounted blade. The 2002 Race saw it won by Nottingham Britannia, who given its many years winners&#x27; names arranged with the race organisers a replacement trophy.
* &quot;Services Pennant&quot; — crews from His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces
* &quot;Churcher Trophy&quot; — university crews of any standard
* &quot;Halladay Trophy&quot; — university crews at or below Intermediate 2 status
* &quot;Overseas Entrants Trophy&quot; — crews from overseas

Eight pennants (large triangular flags), a plaque and individual medals are awarded annually since 2015 to the fastest: 
* Senior, IM1, IM2, IM3A (academic), IM3C (club), NoviceA (academic), NoviceC (club) (all UK).
* Lightweight crew (&lt;73.5 kg for each rower) (Overseas or UK).

<text>Crux Ansata, subtitled &#x27;An Indictment of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;, (1943) is one of the last books published by H. G. Wells (1866–1946). It is a scathing, 96-page critique of the Roman Catholic Church.

==Publication==
&quot;Crux Ansata&quot; was published in 1943, during the Second World War, by Penguin Books, Harmondsworth (Great Britain): Penguin Special No. 129. The U.S. edition was copyrighted and published in 1944 by Agora Publishing Company, New York, with a portrait frontispiece and an appendix of an interview with Wells recorded by John Rowland. The U.S. edition of 144 pages went into a third printing in August 1946.

==Contents==
Wells, then living in London under the regular German Luftwaffe bombings from across the English Channel, extensively attacks Pope Pius XII and calls for the bombing of the city of Rome. 

The book also forms a hostile history of the Roman Catholic Church, deeply imbued with anti-clericalism. Wells, by then an atheist, had a long history of anti-Catholic writings spanning decades.

<text>A driving test (also known as a driving exam or driver&#x27;s test in some places) is a procedure designed to test a person&#x27;s ability to drive a motor vehicle. It exists in various forms worldwide, and is often a requirement to obtain a license to drive a vehicle independently. A driving test generally consists of one or two parts: the practical test (sometimes called a road test in the United States), used to assess a person&#x27;s driving ability under normal operating conditions, and a theory test (written, oral or computerized) to confirm a person&#x27;s knowledge of driving and relevant rules and laws.

The world&#x27;s first mandatory national driving test was introduced in France in 1899.

To make the test fair, written driving tests are normally standardized tests, meaning that everyone takes the same test under the same conditions. In many places the test can be done by computer, and typically consists of questions related to road signs and traffic laws of the respective country, but may also include questions related to road safety best practices or technical questions regarding vehicle operation and maintenance. In many countries, passing a written driving test is required to be allowed to sit the practical test.

== Test requirements ==
Depending on the country and on the driver&#x27;s license category, the practical test includes driving on the public, open road as well as different maneuverability test, which are usually carried out in a controlled environment such as:
* Driving back and forth through a set of traffic cones
* Reversing around a corner or into a parking space
* Emergency stops or evasive maneuvers
*Parallel parking (with a maximum of 2 separate forward movements)
*Reverse angled parking
*Three-point turns (in 3 movements)
*Uphill starts, downhill curbside parking with gear shifts
*Gear shifts moving off green lights (manual-transmission only)
*Lane changes
*Entering and leaving intersections (from give ways, stop signs, roundabouts)
Tests for special types of vehicles might have additional requirements, such as:
* Turning and leaving controlled junctions with trailer and/or with an extra one for multi-rig road trains
* Coupling and de-coupling of a trailer to a truck, including establishing the electrical and compressed-air connections and checking them
* Maintaining a motorcycle stable at low speed
In some countries (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) maneuverability tests are timed, meaning there is an expected time that a driver has to complete these tasks, so they don&#x27;t hold up traffic.

In most European Union member countries, the road test may be taken on either a manual or an automatic vehicle, however, when using an automatic vehicle, the driver&#x27;s license will be restricted to such vehicles. This is also true for New Zealand and Australian road tests. A candidate who passes their test in an automatic may take and pass a second practical test in a manual at a later date to upgrade their license.

Depending on the country, other tests may be required, such as an eyesight test or a reaction test. These may be part of the theory test or the practical test or may be separate tests, in which case they are usually a prerequisite for admission to the practical test. The United Kingdom and some other countries use a Hazard Perception Test as part of the theory test, in which candidates are shown multiple short video clips of driving scenarios and must respond to any emerging hazards.

In the United States, most Department of Motor Vehicles offices do not provide vehicles for the road test and so the person taking the test must provide their own vehicle. This is useful because the vehicle they use for the test is typically the same vehicle they have used to practice driving. Before they can use the vehicle for the test, they must show proof of liability insurance to the DMV for the particular vehicle to avoid liability from a collision that could occur during the test.

In Australia and New Zealand own vehicles must be provided, and the driver must show proof of yearly Warranty of Fitness and registration (at Vehicle Testing New Zealand at the latter) to prove the car&#x27;s road-worthiness. Only in Northern Territory and New Zealand Automobile Association-affiliated instructors are where driving instructors can become testing officers for official driving tests, but one must not assess their own students, and they will have to drive in the cars of the testing officers, except for truck-licenses (in NT) due to the lack of qualified instructors in the territory. The road test may be taken on either a manual or an automatic vehicle, however, when using an automatic vehicle, the driver&#x27;s license will be restricted to such vehicles.

In New Zealand, in particular, the driver must pass two driving tests: One for restricted license, for driving independently during 7am-10pm, but supervised outside of those times, or must head home; in the same class and transmission (automatic/manual) as practised, as well as power restrictions if going for a motorbike license. This test tests for maneuverability (reverse parking, 3-point turns (without using driveways in Australia, with in NZ), U-turns and forward square parking (backward and forward square parkings in Australia) and motorway test. The shorter, 45-minute full-license test, taken at at least 6 months after, only tests for hazard detection, give way rules (changed to small corners&#x27; pass rule in 2016), road positioning, changing speed limit zones and gap selections in inner city streets.

<doc id="972615" wikidata="Q3825159" url="?curid=972615" title="Radial arm maze">
<text>The radial arm maze was designed by Olton and Samuelson in 1976 to measure spatial learning and memory in rats. The original apparatus consists of eight equidistantly spaced arms, each about 4 feet long, and all radiating from a small circular central platform (later versions have used as few as three and as many as 48 arms). At the end of each arm there is a food site, the contents of which are not visible from the central platform.

Two types of memory that are assessed during the performance in this task are reference memory and working memory. Reference memory is assessed when the rats only visit the arms of the maze which contains the reward. The failure to do so will result in reference memory error. Working memory is assessed when the rats enter each arm a single time. Re-entry into the arms would result in a working memory error.

The design ensures that, after checking for food at the end of each arm, the rat is always forced to return to the central platform before making another choice. As a result, the rat always has eight possible options. Elaborate controls are used to ensure that the rats are not simply using their sense of smell, either to sense unclaimed food objects or to sense their own tracks.

Olton and Samuelson found that rats have excellent memories for visited and unvisited arms; they made, on average, about 7.0 novel entries in their first 8 choices, and thus were 88% correct. Chance performance with eight arms would be 5.3 novel entries in the first 8 choices (66% correct). Olton and Samuelson also found when they switched some already-visited arms into as yet unvisited locations partway through a trial, that the rats tended to visit as-yet unvisited locations even when doing so meant running down arms that had already been traversed, and tended to avoid arms that had not yet been traversed but were now in previously visited locations. It therefore seems that in remembering locations on the radial arm maze, rats do not rely on local intra-maze cues, but rather on extra-maze cues.

== Uses ==
The maze has since been used extensively by researchers interested in studying the spatial learning and spatial memory of animals. For example, Olton and colleagues found that performance declined only slightly to 82% novel entries in the first 17 entries on a 17-arm maze. Roberts found no decline in the percentage of correct choices as the number of arms on a radial maze were increased from 8 to 16 and then to 24. Cole and Chappell-Stephenson, using a radial maze with food locations ranging from 8 to 48, estimated the limit of spatial memory in rats to be between 24 and 32 locations.

In one experiment utilizing the radial arm maze, it was shown that spatial relations among hidden target sites control spatial decisions that rats make and are unrelated to visual or perceptual cues that are related to certain locations.

In another experiment, it was shown that subjects with Williams syndrome performed significantly worse compared to control subjects in multiple parameters such as visuo-spatial memory, general spatial function, and procedural competence.

In mice, large differences in learning ability exist among different inbred strains. These differences appear to be correlated with the size of a part of the hippocampal mossy fiber projection.

The radial arm maze has shown to be practicable to investigate how drugs affect memory performance. It has also been shown to be useful in distinguishing the cognitive effects of an array of toxicants.

The radial arm maze has also been use for several studies in children and adults. A particular study led by L. Mandolesi used subjects with William&#x27;s Syndrome (WS) because of the interest placed on their cognitive profile. There is a dissociation between spatial processing and visuo-object processing suggests that in WS subjects spatial functions are more severely impaired than visuo-perceptual ones. This is what RAM tests for.

== Limitations ==
Various different types of mazes are used to assess memory. It is believed that performance of animals in one type of maze cannot be generalized to other mazes because all mazes require animals to utilize a different set of skills.

<doc id="972617" wikidata="Q2275911" url="?curid=972617" title="Children of Gebelawi">
<text>Children of Gebelawi () is a novel by the Egyptian writer and Nobel laureate Naguib Mahfouz. Its Egyptian dialectal transliteration is Awlad Haretna. An alternative English title is Children of the Alley.

==Controversy==
Originally published in Arabic in 1959 in serialised form in the daily newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;, it was met with severe opposition from religious authorities, and was only released uncut in its entirety because of the intervention of president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was a friend of &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;&#x27;s editor, Mohammed Heikal. Publication in the form of a book was banned in Egypt.

It was first printed in Lebanon in 1967. An English translation by Philip Stewart was published in 1981 and is no longer in print; the American University of Cairo had controlled the world rights since 1976 and had licensed Heinemann Educational Books to publish Stewart&#x27;s version, but Heinemann sold back its rights a few weeks before the Nobel Prize. Three Continents Press still had license to publish in the American market, and Stewart wanted to continue publishing quietly in America and to avoid a world-wide relaunch of such a controversial book, but when he refused to sell his copyright, American University of Cairo commissioned a new version by Peter Theroux for Doubleday.

It was this book that earned Naguib Mahfouz condemnation from Omar Abdel-Rahman in 1989, who called on him to repent or be killed. Abdel-Rahman also claimed that &quot;If this sentence had been passed on Naguib Mahfouz when he wrote &quot;Children of the Alley&quot;, Salman Rushdie would have realized that he had to stay within bounds&quot;. As a result, in 1994 – a day after the anniversary of the prize – Mahfouz was attacked and stabbed in the neck by two extremists outside his Cairo home. Mahfouz survived the attack, yet he suffered from its consequences until his death in 2006.

Four months after Mahfouz&#x27;s death, the book was officially released in Egypt, where it became a best seller.

==Synopsis==

The story recreates the interlinked history of the three monotheistic Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), allegorised against the setting of an imaginary 19th century Cairene alley.

Critics claimed that Gabalawi stands for God. Mahfouz rejected this, saying that he stood for &quot;a certain idea of God that men have made&quot; and that &quot;Nothing can represent God. God is not like anything else. God is gigantic.&quot;

The first four sections retell, in succession, the stories of: Adam (Adham أدهم) and how he was favoured by Gabalawi over the latter&#x27;s other sons, including the eldest Satan/Iblis (Idris إدريس). In subsequent generations the heroes relive the lives of Moses (Gabal جبل), Jesus (Rifa&#x27;a رفاعة) and Muhammad (Qasim قاسم). The followers of each hero settle in different parts of the alley, symbolising Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Mahfouz writes&quot;Good examples would not be wasted on our alley were it not afflicted with forgetfulness, But forgetfulness is the plague of our alley.&quot; 

The protagonist of the book&#x27;s fifth section is Arafa (عرفة), who symbolises modern science and comes after the prophets, while all of their followers claim Arafa as one of their own.

Central to the plot are the &quot;futuwwat&quot; (strongmen) who control the alley and exact protection money from the people. The successive heroes overthrow the strongmen of their time, but in the next generation new strongmen spring up and things are as bad as ever. Arafa tries to use his knowledge of explosives to destroy the strongmen, but his attempts to discover Gabalawi&#x27;s secrets leads to the death of the old man (though he does not directly kill him). The Chief Strongman guesses the truth and blackmails Arafa into helping him to become the dictator of the whole Alley. The book ends, after the murder of Arafa, with his friend searching in a rubbish tip for the book in which Arafa wrote his secrets. The people say &quot;Oppression must cease as night yields to day. We shall see the end of tyranny and the dawn of miracles.&quot; 

== Reviews and interpretations ==
The book version of the material reflects the Middle Eastern story telling tradition dating back to One Thousand and One Nights. Mahfouz later published a book, Arabian Nights and Days: a Novel, that is based on characters derived from One Thousand and One Nights. Mafouz uses the novel form in this work rather than the story form more common in Middle Eastern writing. He read Western literature widely and is considered one of the writers responsible for introducing the novel form in the Middle East. 

Children of the Alley is really a collection of novellas and reflects the fact that it originated as a newspaper serial. The good guys vary, but the villains are variation on a theme. Mafouz is reflecting on the Egyptian experience of hope with a new leader such as Nassar and Sadat that is then dashed. None of the heroes succeed in improving the plight of the people for more than a brief period of time. Sharing of the wealth occurs briefly but then vanishes. The heroes are benevolent leaders, but it is the leader, good or bad, who makes the rules reflecting Middle Eastern experience of governing. The novellas show no input from the people (democratic input) in governing. The people are lucky if they get a good and generous leader even if only for a short time Most of the time they get inequality and despotic, violent thugs as leaders. 

The book is pessimistic but as David Frum has pointed out ends on a positive note: &quot;Yet the people bore the outrages steadfastly, taking refuge in patience. They held fast to hope, and whenever they were persecuted, they said, “Injustice must have an end, as day follows night. We will see the death of tyranny, and the dawn of light and miracles.” 

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, the reviewer suggests that the book represents &quot;man&#x27;s attempt to puzzle out the mysteriousness of God and His seeming indifference to human suffering&quot;. But the most conspicuous theme is the uphill struggle of the good against the wicked and the corrupt.&quot;

The book is heavily influenced by Arab political experience and by a lifetime spent in Cairo. Mafouz grew up in a lower middle class, devout Muslim family in Old Cairo with its medievil alleys and Coptic and Muslim alleys. Children of the Alley is set in the alleys of Old Cairo. Its portraits of leaders reflects the political history of Egypt during Mahfouz&#x27;s lifetime.

<doc id="972625" wikidata="Q4377348" url="?curid=972625" title="Preobrazhenskoye, Kamchatka Oblast">
<text>Preobrazhenskoye () was a village (&quot;selo&quot;) in Aleutsky District of Kamchatka Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, located on Medny Island in the Commander Islands group east of the Kamchatka Peninsula.

The village was founded in the 19th century by Aleut (Unangan) settlers from Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands. They were engaged in whaling and sealing with harpoons and spears. Fishing and hunting of whales and other
marine mammals were the mainstay of the economy there.

To reportedly &#x27;accelerate economic progress&#x27; of the Commander Islands, the entire population of the village was moved to Nikolskoye on Bering Island. The village was abolished in November 1977 and has remained uninhabited ever since.

<doc id="972627" wikidata="Q6333494" url="?curid=972627" title="KMFM (radio network)">
<text>KMFM is a network of radio stations that was formed from the merger of seven Independent Local Radio stations and one digital station (on the Kent Digital Multiplex) owned by the KM Group, broadcasting to the county of Kent in the United Kingdom. Whilst the station broadcasts as one countywide station, it is officially eight separate licenses.

KMFM offers its listeners local news and music. KMFM plays a mix of music, mainly covering the current Top 40 hits after adopting a contemporary hit radio format in 2012. The previous KMFM format had been aimed at an older audience.

As of March 2024, the network broadcasts to a combined audience of 187,000, according to RAJAR.

==Original stations==
When the original stations were rebranded, KMFM operated each of the seven stations locally on FM throughout Kent, with one county-wide station on DAB on the NOW Kent multiplex. Apart from KMFM Ashford, each station was previously independent before being bought by the KM Group and rebranded.

==Programming==

All KMFM stations adopted a common programming in March 2012. The previous local breakfast DJs had been made redundant following the close of their breakfast shows the previous Friday, and all other shows presented by them were also removed from the network.

KMFM Extra, until then a separate station with a unique schedule, was closed down in June 2012 and replaced on DAB with the regular KMFM service. Each area however still offers local advertisements and sponsorships (in the case of the DAB and online services, countywide adverts are heard).

Originally each station produced its own programming during daytime. Apart from Medway, from 2007 each station grouped with its neighbour (West Kent and Maidstone; Canterbury and Thanet; Ashford and Shepway and White Cliffs Country) to network programmes between 11am and 7pm. The programmes were merged in April 2009 to create two groups with their own networked programming – West (Maidstone, Medway and West Kent) and East (Ashford, Canterbury, Shepway and White Cliffs Country and Thanet). At other times (evenings and weekends) programming was broadcast across all seven stations.

In September 2009, KMFM was given permission to network all its programmes apart from Monday to Saturday breakfast, and Sunday afternoons. Saturday breakfast and Sunday afternoons were networked in 2010. Breakfast shows for KMFM Maidstone and KMFM West Kent were merged in January 2011.

==Studios==
Originally all seven stations broadcast from studios within their transmission area. KMFM Canterbury moved to the Ashford studio in 2008, and KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country joined it in April 2009. KMFM Thanet broadcast from Cliftonville near Margate (having been relocated from Margate harbour). All three stations in the west network broadcast from Medway. Each station has however retained its sales teams within the transmission area.

Since the merger of all stations, all programmes are produced and broadcast from the Medway studios. The Ashford and Cliftonville studios have been closed.

==News service==
Initially, each station provided an independent service during peak hours from their respective newsrooms.

Local bulletins have since been superseded by a county-wide bulletin. This system operates from 6am until 6pm on weekdays and 8am until 1pm on weekends; outside of those hours, KMFM&#x27;s off-peak news service is provided by Sky News Radio. News bulletins are provided on the hour from the Medway studios; previously the Canterbury studio had been the news hub until this closed in 2009.

Bulletins were also provided at 7.30am, 8.30am, 4.30pm and 5.30pm on weekdays. The half-past bulletins started in September 2006 to replace extended news bulletins at the top of the hour. This ended in autumn 2011 before being restarted in mid-2012.

<text>In Bábism, Bayán (), or exposition, denotes the whole body of the works of the Báb. It also refers more specifically to a set of two books written by the Báb around 1848:

Some modern Bábís (followers of the Báb) call themselves &#x27;Bayaní&#x27; after this title of the Báb&#x27;s writings. Baháʼís also see the Bayán as holy, since they consider their founder, Baháʼu&#x27;lláh, to be the fulfillment of the Báb&#x27;s main prophecy.

<text>Medny Island (), also spelled &quot;Mednyy&quot; or &quot;Mednyi&quot;, sometimes called Copper Island in English (literally translated from Russian), is the smaller (after Bering Island) of the two main islands in the Commander Islands in the North Pacific Ocean, east of Kamchatka, Russia. (The other fifteen are better described as islets and rocks.) These islands belong to the Kamchatka Krai of the Russian Federation.

The island was uninhabited until the late 19th century, when Aleuts came from Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands to Medny Island.

The island is long and between wide and its area is . Its maximum elevation is and the average annual temperature is . About off the northwestern end of the islands are the &quot;Beaver Stones&quot; (Бобровые камни in Russian), two islets connected by an isthmus, with a combined length of .
==History==
The island was sighted on 5 November 1741 by Bering and his crew while returning from the expedition during which he found America from the west, but he did not land on this island.

The Russian naval officer and historian Vasily Berch believed that Yemelyan Basov reached this island in 1745, during his second of four expeditions to the Commander Islands between 1743 and 1749, and that most of the furs he brought back to Kamchatka in 1745 were hunted on this island.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the settlement of Preobrazhenskoye was established by Aleuts who moved there from Attu Island. 

According to linguists, the island&#x27;s residents spoke a creole language, known as the Mednyj Aleut language, which combined Russian and Aleut vocabulary and grammar.

In 1970, all citizens of the island were moved to neighboring Bering Island. Until 2001, the island was occupied as a frontier post. Since then, the island has been completely uninhabited. Scientific studies of the fauna and flora are conducted annually.

==Ecology==
Medny Island is home to many Steller sea lions. 340 pups were born on the island in 1999, and 153 in 2016.

<text>A shootaround is an informal pre-game practice session common among professional and collegiate basketball teams around the world.

Shootarounds do not involve all of the formal elements of a regular practice. They usually do not involve conditioning drills, run-throughs of plays and extensive chalk-talks by coaches like normal practice sessions. The practice is largely informal and may consist of players practicing their shooting, with five or six players shooting at one basket and rebounding others&#x27; shots. 

NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Sharman invented the morning shootaround as a way to burn off nervous energy on game days. He took the shootaround with him to his first coaching jobs in the ABL, ABA, and later, the NBA. After coaching the Los Angeles Lakers to the league championship in 1972, every other team in the league added the shootaround to its game-day regimen.

The shootaround is a staple of the pre-game warmup routine for all NBA teams, most college teams, and many teams at all levels. So infused is the term into basketball&#x27;s lexicon, in fact, that ESPN&#x27;s NBA re-cap show is called &quot;NBA Shootaround&quot;.

<text>Destiny Fulfilled is the fifth and final studio album by American girl group Destiny&#x27;s Child. It was released on November 8, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. Following the conclusion of promotional activities for their globally successful third studio album &quot;Survivor&quot; (2001), Destiny&#x27;s Child embarked on a two-year hiatus, during which each member released solo albums to varying levels of success. They reunited in the summer of 2004 to record &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, primarily at the Sony Music Studios in New York City. Unlike the group&#x27;s previous recordings, the album saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production, drawing inspiration from the events in their lives while being apart.

Executive producing &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; alongside their manager Mathew Knowles, Destiny&#x27;s Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder and Rodney Jerkins, as well as several new ones, including 9th Wonder, Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison. Their efforts resulted with an R&amp;B record further exploring genres such as crunk, dance, hip hop and funk. Lyrically a concept album, each of its tracks is a continuation of its predecessor, altogether telling a complete story tracing a woman&#x27;s relationship journey. The balladry and lyrical content were met with generally mixed reviews from music critics, who nevertheless praised the equality of contributions among members and their vocal performances.

A highly-anticipated comeback album, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; went through several release date alterations due to a concern over Internet leaks, ultimately being released a day earlier. Its street date violation resulted with a premature debut at number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s sales were principally unaffected by the unconventional release as it subsequently peaked at number two, selling 558,000 units within its first eight days of release, and went on to be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Despite its mixed critical reception, the album garnered five Grammy Award nominations, including Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. One of the best-selling girl group albums of all time, the album has sold over seven million copies worldwide.

&quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; produced four singles. &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot; both peaked at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and achieved widespread international commercial success. &quot;Girl&quot; peaked only at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 but was a top-10 hit in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; fared better on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 14. Destiny&#x27;s Child further promoted the album with their world tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It (2005). During the tour&#x27;s Palau Sant Jordi show in Barcelona on June 11, 2005, the group announced their disbandment; they formally disbanded following the release of the live album &quot;Live in Atlanta&quot; (2006).

== Background and development ==
In April 2001, Destiny&#x27;s Child released their highly-anticipated third studio album &quot;Survivor&quot;. Fueled by the widespread commercial success of &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;, it became their first US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number-one album. The album sold steadily and went on to be certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Furthermore, it was nominated for Best R&amp;B Album at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards (2002), and has sold over ten million copies worldwide. While recording &quot;Survivor&quot; in December 2000, Beyoncé announced that Destiny&#x27;s Child would eventually embark on a hiatus which would allow each member to release a solo album, which they hoped would further increase interest in the group. The idea of solo albums emanated from the group&#x27;s manager and Beyoncé&#x27;s father Mathew Knowles. Kelly Rowland further explained in an interview that Destiny&#x27;s Child had been present in the media for a long time and they wanted to &quot;give the public eye a rest from DC for a minute&quot;. During that same interview, she acknowledged that the trio would reunite during the fall of 2003 to start recording a new album.

During the hiatus, Michelle Williams released two gospel studio albums–&quot;Heart to Yours&quot; (2002) and &quot;Do You Know&quot; (2004). The former peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart, becoming 2002&#x27;s biggest selling gospel album; with over 220,000 copies sold in the US and 500,000 worldwide. Furthermore, Williams won a British MOBO Award for &quot;Best Gospel Act&quot; in 2002 and made her Broadway debut, as the lead in the musical &quot;Aida&quot; on November 18, 2003. Although Beyoncé&#x27;s solo album was initially scheduled for October 2002, its release was postponed due to the success of Kelly Rowland&#x27;s collaboration with Nelly, &quot;Dilemma&quot;, which peaked atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for a cumulative 10 weeks and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. Therefore, Rowland&#x27;s pop rock-oriented solo debut &quot;Simply Deep&quot; was moved up to October, ahead of Beyoncé&#x27;s album. &quot;Simply Deep&quot; debuted at number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and has gone on to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over 600,000 copies in the US and over 2.5 million worldwide. Beyoncé, who was the last member to release an album, was regarded the most successful with &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003). The album debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, enjoying international commercial success and widespread critical acclaim. Furthermore, it produced two US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one hits–&quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;–and won five Grammy Awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (2004), causing Beyoncé to tie for winning the most Grammy Awards at a single ceremony among women. The members&#x27; respective solo achievements led to intense speculation over the disbandment of Destiny&#x27;s Child. In July 2004, amidst the rumors, Rowland announced the group&#x27;s return to the studio to record &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;. The group claimed the reunion was destined to happen, and that their affinity for each other kept them together.

== Recording and production ==
Production of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; commenced during the summer of 2004, with Destiny&#x27;s Child enlisting frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder and Rodney Jerkins, as well as new ones, including 9th Wonder, Sean Garrett and Rich Harrison. 9th Wonder initially met Beyoncé while she was in the recording studio as her now-husband, rapper Jay-Z recorded the song &quot;Threat&quot; for his album &quot;The Black Album&quot; (2003). After Jay-Z went through the CD of tracks 9th Wonder had handed to him, Beyoncé mentioned that she liked what she heard from him. Several months later, 9th Wonder received a call from Jay-Z, asking for him to give the CD to Destiny&#x27;s Child. He was surprised at being contacted by the rapper about working with the group, as he confessed that he had never owned an album by them. He later traveled to Los Angeles to work with the trio for their next album. During the three-day session, he produced the songs &quot;Girl&quot;, &quot;Is She the Reason&quot; and &quot;Game Over&quot;. Garrett, who co-wrote &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;T-Shirt&quot;, &quot;Is She the Reason&quot;, &quot;Girl&quot; and &quot;Through with Love&quot;, recalled working on the album: &quot;There was so much magic going on in the studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. &#x27;Lose My Breath&#x27; was towards the latter part of the album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that.&quot;

Destiny&#x27;s Child recorded &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; within a three-week period, mostly at the Sony Music Studios in New York City, where all tracks except &quot;Through with Love&quot; were recorded. They took the role of executive producing, alongside their manager Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance tracks and ballads—which they considered songs listeners cannot sing along with. Beyoncé further elaborated: &quot;We wanted to make sure that the songs would be something that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance.&quot; Jerkins, who had worked with the group on their previous studio albums and with Beyoncé for her solo debut &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003), was concerned with how he would manage the production, saying: &quot;How is this going to work?&#x27; Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how&#x27;s it going to work in a group together?&quot;. However, he stated his skepticism vanished once the recording commenced, as he saw the group&#x27;s &quot;excitement being back in the studio together&quot;, calling the process &quot;natural&quot;.

The members stated the first week of recording &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; was spent solely on conversations about the events in their lives while being apart, as they hadn&#x27;t spent quality time together for an extended period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record. In most cases, producers would send the group a CD containing a track which would serve as the basis in the songwriting process; without the producers&#x27; supervision of which part to sing, a new direction of their style was formed, differing from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; on some tracks from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, their vocals alternated on every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Differing from &quot;Survivor&quot;, on which Beyoncé had taken an active role in writing and producing, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences, individual opinions and points of view independent of those from the other members. As Kelly Rowland was recently engaged during the songwriting process, her writing was further influenced by the engagement. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the lyrical themes as well: &quot;All of us have been in three different places ... so there&#x27;s a lot to talk about, a lot that&#x27;s gone on, personally. I think it&#x27;s important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we&#x27;ve been going through separately into the new record.&quot;

== Music and lyrics ==

During an interview with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each track was a subsequent continuation of its predecessor. She concluded: &quot;[The album continues with] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It&#x27;s friendship, it&#x27;s love, it&#x27;s maturity and growth, and it&#x27;s everything that we wanted it to be.&quot; Musically, Destiny&#x27;s Child tried challenging themselves, as they worked with different arrangements while trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Their final product was a predominantly R&amp;B record, which further incorporated soul, dance and hip hop. The album is mostly composed of mid-tempo tracks, following the up-tempo first two tracks; Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; felt the balladry showcased &quot;the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically&quot;. Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.

&quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; opens with the up-tempo dance track &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, which details a man full of empty promises to a woman. It is musically complete with military, marching-band drums, keyboard stabs, and the backing track contains various sound effects. &quot;Soldier&quot;, featuring T.I. and Lil Wayne, contains elements of Southern hip hop and crunk. Unsatisfied and unfulfilled with the lover from &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, the protagonists ask for a decent &quot;soldier&quot;, further singing about finding a gangster. After finding him, the R&amp;B ballad &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; lyrically details submissively serving the man. Inspired by him, the protagonists sing about doing various things to make him happy, musically accompanied by synthesizer as the song builds a crescendo. The fourth track &quot;T-Shirt&quot; is complete with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping in bed with their lover&#x27;s T-shirt, &quot;craving his presence, and inhailing his scent&quot;. &quot;Is She the Reason&quot; is an R&amp;B ballad noted to have a similar chord progression to works of The Beatles. It lyrically follows a protagonist competing with another woman for her lover&#x27;s love and attention. The song contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore&#x27;s song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know No One Else to Turn To&quot;.

&quot;Girl&quot; was noted for its Motown influence and friendship-themed lyrics. It features Beyoncé and Williams concerned about the relationship Rowland is in, trying to comfort her and persuade her to leave her partner. Rowland lyrically responds to them by ending the relationship on the following track &quot;Bad Habit&quot;, on which she solely sings lead vocals. &quot;If&quot;, complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don&#x27;t appreciate their girlfriends until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. &quot;Free&quot; was described as a &quot;soul classic from 1975&quot;, with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being &quot;set free&quot; after being in a relationship in which their efforts were never reciprocated. The mid-tempo track &quot;Through with Love&quot; was noted for its &quot;angry&quot; nature as it addresses a break-up. It features an undulating piano line as the members sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. On the closing track &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;capital &quot;L&quot; kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment&quot;, as the group &quot;thank[s] God for love&quot;. They further sing about how people &quot;can&#x27;t truly love another until [they] love God and then [themselves]&quot;, proclaiming that they have found love and are &quot;madly in it&quot;.

== Release and promotion ==

Promotion of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; commenced when Destiny&#x27;s Child performed &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; on September 9, 2004, on ABC&#x27;s 2004 NFL season &quot;Opening Kickoff&quot; special, to break their two-year hiatus. The album&#x27;s track listing was revealed on October 15. On October 25, they appeared at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas, performing the song with an a cappella, jazz-styled opening. The following month, they performed a medley composed of &quot;Say My Name&quot;, &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; and finished with &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, where they also sat down for an interview with Oprah Winfrey. On November 8, 2004, the trio appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and performed &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; along with &quot;Say My Name&quot;. They additionally appeared on the German entertainment television show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; on November 13, and performed &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;. Originally slated for November 16, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; was released a day earlier due to Columbia Records&#x27; concern over &quot;potential for Internet leaks and &#x27;burned&#x27; CD counterfeits&quot; which could &quot;lead consumers to experience inferior and incomplete versions of the album&quot;. MTV had already made it available for streaming as part of its program &quot;The Leak&quot; on November 8, while Trans World Entertainment and Walmart began selling the album on November 12. Although the album&#x27;s format was originally announced to be the then-new DualDisc, it was released on an audio-only CD; however, it was released on DualDisc on February 8, 2005. On BET&#x27;s &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot;, Destiny&#x27;s Child performed &quot;Soldier&quot; on November 15, 2004. They also performed the song on CBS″s &quot;The Early Show&quot; on December 8. In February 2005, they gave another performance of &quot;Soldier&quot; on the British television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. At the 2005 NBA All-Star Game on February 20, they performed both &quot;Soldier&quot; and &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;. They performed the latter again at the 2005 ESPY Awards on July 13. &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; was performed on June 28 at the 2005 BET Awards in Los Angeles.

When the advanced release date of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; was announced, Destiny&#x27;s Child confirmed the initial dates of their world tour Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It, which visited Asia, Oceania, Europe and North America from April to September 2005. Promotions of the tour aired over radio stations and television channels across the United States, with the group further collaborating with McDonald&#x27;s, which served as its sponsor. Outside North America, it was promoted with a CD+DVD tour edition of the album, which included music videos and live performances. The tour&#x27;s set list included tracks from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; alongside Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s previous work and each member&#x27;s individual songs. Numerous costume changes occurred throughout the show; the concerts exhibited products from Beyoncé&#x27;s clothing line from House of Deréon, the company she co-founded with her mother Tina Knowles. During a concert at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona on June 11, Rowland announced before 16,000 spectators that Destiny&#x27;s Child would disband following the end of the tour. In a statement released to MTV, the group said the tour had provided them the opportunity to depart from Destiny&#x27;s Child on a &quot;high note&quot;. They also talked about the moment when the group started their musical endeavor and their realizations of pursuing individual careers after working together for several years. Destiny&#x27;s Child thanked fans for their support while not closing the chance of seeing them continue supporting each member&#x27;s goals in music, film and television. The July 15 show in Atlanta was filmed for the video album &quot;Live in Atlanta&quot;, which was released on March 28, 2006. A commercial success, the video debuted atop the US Top Music Videos and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Singles ==
The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; first appeared as a streaming track on September 9, 2004, exclusively from AOL Music, following which it was available as a digital download only from Walmart, then on October 5 it was made widely available. It hit the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 30 on October 2, rising to number 3 a month later, becoming the group&#x27;s seventh consecutive top-ten single on the chart. Furthermore, it became their second Dance Club Songs number-one single. The digital single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 2020. Internationally, the song peaked atop the European Hot 100 Singles, as well as charts in Belgium, Ireland and Switzerland, further peaking within the top ten in almost every other country. The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) used the song as the music for their introductory montage during the 2004 NBA Playoffs and through the first few weeks of the 2005 NBA Playoffs. Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards (2005). Its accompanying music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld and shows the group members involved in an alleyway dance battle against their own duplicates. At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Dance Video.

&quot;Soldier&quot; was released as the second single from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; on November 9, 2004. Repeating the success of its predecessor, it peaked at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and atop the Dance Club Songs. The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020. Internationally, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Critically acclaimed, it was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards (2006). The black and white accompanying music video for the song was directed by Ray Kay and features appearances from featured artists T.I. and Lil Wayne, Beyoncé&#x27;s sister Solange, singers Lloyd and Ginuwine, and rappers Bow Wow, Ice Cube, WC and Jeezy. At the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for Best Group Video.

&quot;Girl&quot; was released as the third single from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; on March 15, 2005. It failed to replicate the success of its predecessors as it peaked only at number 23 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, ending Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s streak of top-ten singles on the chart. The digital single was certified gold by the RIAA in October 2005. Internationally, the song peaked within the top ten in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. Its &quot;Sex and the City&quot;-inspired accompanying music video was directed by Bryan Barber and follows the song&#x27;s lyrical theme, with Rowland ending the video by leaving her deceitful lover.

&quot;Cater 2 U&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; on June 7, 2005. A moderate commercial success, it peaked at number 14 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The digital single was certified platinum by the RIAA in July 2020. Internationally, the song failed to chart in most countries due to its digital-only release, but peaked at number seven in New Zealand. Despite causing polarity among critics due to its lyrics, the song was nominated for Grammy Awards for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&amp;B Song in 2006. Its Jake Nava-directed accompanying music video depicts the group in various settings at the Red Rock Canyon State Park.

&quot;Got&#x27;s My Own&quot;, which originally appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, was released as a promotional single on May 3, 2005.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Dimitri Ehrlich of &quot;Vibe&quot; complimented the production, saying that it &quot;showcases advanced production values&quot; with &quot;impressive&quot; songwriting and vocal abilities, concluding that it &quot;offers divine satisfaction&quot;. A writer for &quot;Billboard&quot; felt the album worked as &quot;a testament to Beyoncé&#x27;s evolving multiple talents&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Rowland&#x27;s and Williams&#x27; abilities as vocalists and their contributions to the choruses, but felt that Beyoncé &quot;steals every song&quot;, further commending her for sounding &quot;larger than life even when she&#x27;s quiet&quot;. However, he concluded: &quot;as a whole, the album winds up sounding too reserved and heavy-handed, which makes it a disappointment&quot;. Andy Battaglia of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote in his review that &quot;&quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; sounds distant and detached&quot;, further criticizing its mid-tempo balladry for sounding &quot;uninterrupted at best, uninspired at worst&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that the album is &quot;a surprisingly perfunctory disc that never quite justifies its existence&quot;. Alan Ranta of &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; doubted Beyoncé&#x27;s lyrical sincerity, saying: &quot;the success of this album depends once again on the complete suspension of die-hard fans&#x27; disbelief that Beyoncé &#x27;Your Ad Here&#x27; Knowles could ever actually truly love another human being as much as she loves herself and her possessions.&quot;

Caroline Sullivan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that the lead vocals on &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; were likely to be sung by each member equally, noting that it made the album a &quot;democratic&quot; one. However, she criticized Destiny&#x27;s Child for squandering &quot;the extent of their talents&quot; on the album. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also noticed its &quot;overall air of democracy at work&quot; and noted that the album &quot;often moves at a molasses-like pace, weighted down with a preponderance of exquisitely executed but ultimately dull ballads&quot;. Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; echoed Sinclair&#x27;s comments, saying: &quot;In all but a couple of songs, the verses are divided into three sections, with Beyonce leading things off, followed by Rowland, then Williams&quot;. She noted that after a couple of upbeat songs, &quot;the album slumps into an endless string of overwrought R&amp;B ballads where the only saving grace is ... these ladies can harmonize like nobody&#x27;s business.&quot; Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; commented that the album&#x27;s ballads build into &quot;the same sort of standoffish sexual supply-and-demand bartering that has marred their worst tracks&quot;. Sarah Godfrey from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; also criticized the balladry, alongside the absence of women&#x27;s empowerment-themed lyrical content present on the group&#x27;s previous recordings, but noted each member&#x27;s individuality and praised their vocal performances.

In the United States, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; prematurely debuted at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated November 27, 2004 due to a street date violation, amassing sales of 61,000 copies in a single day and registering the highest pre-street date sales in the history of Nielsen SoundScan at the time.

Additionally, the album debuted and peaked at number two on the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart. It was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on April 20, 2018.

==Impact and legacy==
Upon the release of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, numerous critics questioned why Beyoncé returned to Destiny&#x27;s Child after achieving the most solo success among the members, with Eric Henderson from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; lambasting her for performing with the group again with the &quot;full intention&quot; of taking advantage in order to bolster her &quot;divette&quot; status to superstardom. However, Beyoncé responded by saying the motive behind the group&#x27;s reunion was their friendship rather than business. Writing for The Recording Academy, Dontaira Terrell retrospectively claimed &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; &quot;peeled back the layers of the pop phenom girl group we once knew and re-introduced us to a trio of fully evolved, self-realized women&quot;, further describing it as &quot;an ode to the life lessons of friendship, spiritual enlightenment, personal growth and transformation. Its resonance is still widespread, and the baton of wisdom found in the albums [&quot;sic&quot;] lyrical content is just as relevant [in 2019] as it was 15 years ago.&quot;
In the wake of their disbandment announcement in June 2005, Destiny&#x27;s Child revealed in an interview that their disbandment had already been planned during the recording of &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;, adding that its title was not coincidental. During the sessions, they discussed individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. They further elaborated they wanted to part ways &quot;while they were on top — and more importantly, while they were still friends&quot;. Beyoncé had also said &quot;the group felt it still had something to offer musically&quot; with the album, adding: &quot;We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn&#x27;t mean as much to us as just the fact that three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.&quot;. Rowland commented: &quot;We were like, &#x27;You know what, we&#x27;re getting older and we want to end on a high note.&#x27; We want to give our fans a great final record&quot;. Beyoncé also commented regarding the finality of their career: &quot;Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10 years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it because we want to – not because it&#x27;s a good business move.&quot;

Following the conclusion of Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It, the group released their first greatest hits album &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; in October 2005, which became their second US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 number-one album. It included three new tracks, one of which was Beyoncé&#x27;s song &quot;Check on It&quot;, which became her third US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single as a solo artist. They subsequently released the live video album &quot;Live in Atlanta&quot; on March 28, 2006, the same day they received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Afterwards, the group formally disbanded. Following the disbandment, Beyoncé recorded and released her second solo studio album &quot;B&#x27;Day&quot; (2006) to widespread critical and commercial success, while starring in the Academy Award-winning musical drama &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. After numerous postponements, Rowland released her second studio album &quot;Ms. Kelly&quot; in June 2007; it became her first US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top-ten album. During Beyoncé and Rowland&#x27;s respective promotions for their albums, Destiny&#x27;s Child reunited at the BET Awards 2007 and during Beyoncé&#x27;s 2007 world tour The Beyoncé Experience. Michelle Williams released her third studio album &quot;Unexpected&quot;, which showcased a drastic change in her musical style from gospel to dance-pop, in October 2008. Destiny&#x27;s Child would not release another album until the compilation album &quot;Love Songs&quot;–which included &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; tracks &quot;Cater 2 U&quot;, &quot;T-Shirt&quot;, &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Love&quot;, alongside some of the group&#x27;s other previous recordings and the newly-recorded &quot;Nuclear&quot;–in January 2013.

<text>The Mangles River is in the South Island of New Zealand. Its main tributary is the Tūtaki River but it is also fed by water flowing off the Braeburn Range. It feeds into the Buller River near the town of Murchison. The river is popular destination for kayaking and trout fishing.

William Fox was the New Zealand Company agent in Nelson when he explored the Buller as far south as Murchison in February 1846, with Thomas Brunner and Charles Heaphy. They renamed the lower section of the Tiraumea River, after the English MP, Ross Donnelly Mangles, one of the company&#x27;s directors. The official name was gazetted as Mangles River on 27 May 2021.

River pollution has been monitored since 2016. About 75% of the catchment is in native forest, so that water quality is generally good, the only exception being nitrates.

The river is bridged by SH6 near its confluence with the Buller.

<doc id="972644" wikidata="Q1598388" url="?curid=972644" title="Mary Karr">
<text>Mary Karr (born January 16, 1955) is an American poet, essayist and memoirist from East Texas. She is widely noted for her 1995 bestselling memoir &quot;The Liars&#x27; Club&quot;. Karr is the Jesse Truesdell Peck Professor of English Literature at Syracuse University.

==Early life and education==

Karr was born in Groves, Texas, on January 16, 1955, and lived there until moving to Los Angeles in 1972. Her parents, Charlie Marie Moore and Pete Karr, were alcoholics, and she often abused drugs growing up. Karr attended Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, for two years and met poet Etheridge Knight, one of her mentors, there. After a respite from school to participate in the anti-apartheid movement, Karr attended Goddard College and graduated with a terminal degree in fine arts.

== Career ==
=== Memoirs ===
Karr&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Liars&#x27; Club&quot;, published in 1995, was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller for more than a year and named one of the year&#x27;s best books. It explores her deeply troubled childhood, most of which was spent in a gritty industrial section of Southeast Texas in the 1960s. Karr&#x27;s friend Tobias Wolff encouraged her to write her personal history, but she has said she took up the project only when her marriage fell apart. She followed the book with a second memoir, &quot;Cherry&quot; (2000), about her late adolescence and early womanhood.

Karr&#x27;s third memoir, &quot;Lit: A Memoir&quot;, which she says details &quot;my journey from blackbelt sinner and lifelong agnostic to unlikely Catholic&quot;, came out in 2009. The memoir describes Karr&#x27;s time as an alcoholic and the salvation she found in her conversion to Catholicism. She calls herself a cafeteria Catholic.

=== Poetry ===
Karr won a 1989 Whiting Award for her poetry. She was a Guggenheim Fellow in poetry in 2005 and has won Pushcart prizes for both her poetry and essays. Karr has published five volumes of poetry: &quot;Abacus&quot; (Wesleyan University Press, CT, 1987, in its New Poets series), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Tour&quot; (New Directions NY, 1993, an original TPB), &quot;Viper Rum&quot; (New Directions NY, 1998, an original TPB), &quot;Sinners Welcome&quot; (HarperCollins, NY, 2006), and &quot;Tropic of Squalor&quot; (HarperCollins, NY, 2018). Her poems have appeared in major literary magazines such as &quot;Poetry&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

Karr&#x27;s Pushcart Award-winning essay, &quot;Against Decoration&quot;, was originally published in the quarterly review &quot;Parnassus&quot; (1991) and later reprinted in &quot;Viper Rum&quot;. In &quot;Against Decoration&quot;, Karr takes a stand in favor of content over style. She argues that emotions must be directly expressed and that clarity should be a watchword: characters are too obscure, the presented physical world is often &quot;foggy&quot; (imprecise), references are &quot;showy&quot; (both non-germane and overused), metaphors overshadow expected meaning, and techniques of language (polysyllables, archaic words, intricate syntax, &quot;yards of adjectives&quot;) only &quot;slow a reader&#x27;s understanding&quot;.

Another essay, &quot;Facing Altars: Poetry and Prayer&quot;, was originally published in &quot;Poetry&quot; (2005). In it, Karr writes about moving from agnostic alcoholic to baptized Catholic of the decidedly &quot;cafeteria&quot; kind, yet one who prays twice daily with loud fervor from her &quot;foxhole&quot;. She argues that poetry and prayer arise from the same sources within us.

=== Other ===
In 2015, Karr served as the speaker at Syracuse University&#x27;s 161st commencement.

== Personal life ==

Karr was married to poet Michael Milburn for 13 years. Some time after their divorce, she began dating author David Foster Wallace, whose alleged abusive behavior toward Karrwhich included throwing a coffee table at her and harassing her five-year-old sonis documented in his 2012 biography.

Although she has converted to Catholicism, Karr has some views at odds with those of the Catholic Church, such as supporting abortion rights, and has advocated for women&#x27;s ordination to the priesthood. She has described herself as a feminist since the age of 12.

<doc id="972648" wikidata="Q8006569" url="?curid=972648" title="William Carmichael (diplomat)">
<text>William Carmichael (c. 1739–1795) was an American statesman and diplomat from Maryland during and after the Revolutionary War. He participated in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s mission to Paris in 1776-8, represented Maryland in the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779 and was the principal diplomat for the United States to Spain from 1782 to 1794.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Carmichael was born sometime around 1739 at the family home (&quot;Round Top&quot;) in Queen Anne&#x27;s County, Maryland, on the Chester River just opposite Chestertown. Apparently, he was sent to Europe for his education, at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He was living in Chestertown in 1774 and was a member of its Committee of Correspondence during the Chestertown Tea Party. But by the time the Revolutionary War began, he had decamped to London, England, and soon after, in 1776, made his way to Paris, carrying letters to the Continental Congress sewn inside the cover of a pocket dictionary.

=== Early Career (1776–1792) ===

In 1776, Congress named Carmichael as a &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, first as an assistant to Silas Deane. He is credited with befriending the Marquis de Lafayette and recruiting the teenage aristocrat to the American cause; when Lafayette traveled to America, he carried with him a letter of introduction from Carmichael to George Washington&#x27;s aide Tench Tilghman, a fellow Marylander from the Eastern Shore. Carmichael later represented American interests at the court of Frederick II of Prussia in Berlin. He returned to America in February 1778 and the Maryland Assembly sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1780.

Carmichael clashed repeatedly with many of his fellow countrymen, particularly Arthur Lee and John Jay, and his tenure in Congress was a brief and stormy one. His true milieu was the world of European courts and high society, and his principal value to his native country was as an astute and well-informed observer of European political intrigues. In 1779, then, Carmichael returned to the Old World, this time to Madrid as a diplomatic representative to Spain for the United States. At first, he was Secretary to the Legation headed by John Jay. When Jay returned in April 1782 Carmichael became &quot;Chargé d&#x27;Affaires,&quot; remaining in this post at the Spanish royal court until illness forced his replacement in 1794.

=== Late years ===
In 1792, President George Washington appointed Carmichael a commissioner plenipotentiary (together with William Short) to negotiate a treaty with Spain protecting American navigation rights to the Mississippi River. The treaty was concluded shortly after Carmichael&#x27;s death and became known as the Treaty of San Lorenzo or Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty, Thomas Pinckney having stepped in to complete the negotiations. Carmichael was also involved in negotiations to free American mariners who had been taken captive by the Dey of Algiers, a situation that later led to the Barbary Wars.

William Carmichael died in Madrid, Spain on February 9, 1795, and is buried in the Protestant cemetery there. He left a Spanish wife and daughter, who returned to the Eastern Shore of Maryland and were eventually compensated by the U.S. Congress for Carmichael&#x27;s services. His great-nephew was Richard Bennett Carmichael, a pro-Confederate judge and politician.

<doc id="972653" wikidata="Q208824" url="?curid=972653" title="1999 (Prince album)">
<text>1999 is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter and musician Prince, released on October 27, 1982, by Warner Bros. Records. It became his first album to be recorded with his band the Revolution. &quot;1999&quot; critical and commercial success propelled Prince to a place in the public psyche and marked the beginning of two years of heightened fame via his following releases.

&quot;1999&quot; was Prince&#x27;s first top 10 album on the &quot; Billboard&quot; 200, charting at number nine upon release, and was fifth in the &quot; Billboard&quot; Year-End Albums of 1983. &quot;1999&quot;, a protest against nuclear proliferation, was a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 top 20 hit, peaking at number 12. It has since become one of Prince&#x27;s most recognizable compositions. &quot;Delirious&quot; reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; peaked at number six, becoming Prince&#x27;s highest charting US single at the time. &quot;International Lover&quot; was also nominated for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 26th Grammy Awards, which was Prince&#x27;s first Grammy Award nomination.

&quot;1999&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics, and was seen as Prince&#x27;s breakthrough album. On March 24, 1999, &quot;1999&quot; was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Following Prince&#x27;s death in 2016, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaked at number seven, besting its original performance on the chart thirty-three years earlier. A re-release and remaster of the album, including 35 previously unreleased recordings, was released in November 2019.

&quot;1999&quot; has been ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time by several publications and organizations. The music videos for both &quot;1999&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV, making Prince one of the first black artists to be prominently featured on the television channel. According to the &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot;1999&quot; may be Prince&#x27;s most influential album: Its synth-and-drum machine-heavy arrangements codified the Minneapolis sound that loomed over mid-&#x27;80s R&amp;B and pop, not to mention the next two decades&#x27; worth of electro, house, and techno.&quot; It is also included on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2008, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Composition==
The album&#x27;s opening title track, &quot;1999&quot;, was also its first single and initially peaked at 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was subsequently re-released following the huge success of its follow-up single and &quot;1999&quot;″s second track, &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;, which peaked at 6 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Lisa Coleman - who sang on the album - recalled how Prince came up with &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; after sleeping in her pink Mercury Montclair Maurauder. Shortly after being reissued, &quot;1999&quot; hit 12, and subsequently became one of Prince&#x27;s most recognizable compositions. Its composition, and inclusion in the album, may have been originally prompted by a suggestion from the record company.

The music videos for both &quot;1999&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; were significant as two of the first videos by a black artist to receive heavy rotation on the newly launched music video channel, MTV, after heated controversy over its failure to promote black performers. The two tracks were later combined as a double A-side single in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number 2. A subsequent single from the album and its third chronological track, the rockabilly-influenced &quot;Delirious&quot;, still managed top ten status in the United States at 8, but a fourth, the double-sided single &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend We&#x27;re Married&quot;/&quot;Irresistible Bitch&quot;, got no further than 52.

While &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; helped Prince cross over to the wider rock audience, the rest of &quot;1999&quot; retains the funk elements featured in previous albums and is dominated by the use of synthesizers and drum machines. The album is, however, notable within Prince&#x27;s catalogue for its wide variety of themes in addition to the sexual imagery which had already become something of a trademark on his previous work. &quot;Automatic&quot;, extending to almost ten minutes, starts side three of the album with a prominent synthesizer melody and bondage-inspired lyrical imagery which, transplanted to the music video for the track (with a scene that depicted Prince being tied up and whipped by band-members Lisa Coleman and Jill Jones), had been deemed too sexual for MTV in 1983.

&quot;Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)&quot;, an ode to a harsh lover, is the centerpiece of a preoccupation with Computer Age themes that would continue into future albums. This is also reflected in various aspects of the album&#x27;s instrumentation, with Prince fully embracing the gadgetry and sounds of emergent electro-funk and 1980s sequencing technology on tracks like &quot;Let&#x27;s Pretend We&#x27;re Married&quot; and &quot;All the Critics Love U in New York&quot;, songs that widen his use of synthesizers and prominently feature the use of a Linn LM-1 drum machine. &quot;1999&quot; also contains two ballads in &quot;Free&quot;, a piano piece encouraging people to count their blessings and be thankful for what they have, and &quot;International Lover&quot;, a slow-paced love song for which Prince received his first Grammy Award nomination in 1984 under the category of Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover features elements from the front cover of Prince&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Controversy&quot;; namely the eyes and the &quot;Rude Boy&quot; pin in the &quot;1999&quot;, the jacket studs in the &quot;R&quot; and the smile in the &quot;P&quot;. The &quot;I&quot; in &quot;Prince&quot; contains the words &quot;and the Revolution&quot; written backwards (as &quot;dna eht noituloveR&quot;), both acknowledging his backing band and foreshadowing the next four years of his career.

==Release==
&quot;1999&quot; was released on October 27, 1982, by Warner Bros. Records. It was the fifth album released by Prince. &quot;1999&quot; was Prince&#x27;s first top ten album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number nine. It was fifth in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Albums of 1983. Following Prince&#x27;s death in 2016, the album re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaked at number seven, besting its original performance on the chart thirty-three years earlier. It also peaked in the top 10 in New Zealand, reaching number six on the New Zealand Albums Chart in 1982.

===Remastered, Deluxe and Super Deluxe re-issues===
The album was released as a &quot;Remastered&quot;, &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition on November 29, 2019. The most elaborate re-issue contains five CDs featuring previously unreleased tracks, and a live DVD, with a total running time of 5 hours &amp; 53 minutes. It reached the top 20 of the charts in Belgium, the Netherlands and Hungary.

==Critical reception and legacy==

&quot;1999&quot; was well received by contemporary critics. Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in December 1982, Michael Hill praised Prince for &quot;working like a colorblind technician who&#x27;s studied both Devo and Afrika Bambaataa and the Soulsonic Force, keeping the [&quot;1999&quot;″s] songs constantly kinetic with an inventive series of shocks and surprises.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; reviewer Robert Christgau was more reserved in his praise. While conceding that, &quot;like every black pop auteur, Prince commands his own personal groove ... stretching his flat funk forcebeat onto two discs worth of deeply useful dance tracks&quot;, he also believed that the musician&#x27;s only reliable subject remains race, leaving the critic with doubts about the messages behind the sex and apocalyptic songs.

Retrospective appraisals have been even more favorable. According to &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot;1999&quot; may be Prince&#x27;s most influential album: Its synth-and-drum machine-heavy arrangements codified the Minneapolis sound that loomed over mid-&#x27;80s R&amp;B and pop, not to mention the next two decades&#x27; worth of electro, house, and techno.&quot; Paul A. Thompson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted the way Prince &quot;marshal[led] the Reagan years and the LM-1 for his own purposes&quot; has rarely been replicated and called &quot;1999&quot; a &quot;rare record that has come to define its era while also existing outside of it, a masterpiece that immediately precedes the albums Prince fashioned, conspicuously, as masterpieces.&quot; Thompson also described the album as a &quot;computer breathing.&quot; Also writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Maura Johnston wrote in 2016 that through the &quot;balancing synth-funk explorations...taut pop construction, genre-bending, and the proto-nuclear fallout of lust, &quot;1999&quot; still sounds like a landmark release in 2016&quot;. Johnston further praised Prince&#x27;s &quot;singular vision and willingness to indulge his curiosities&quot; for creating an &quot;apocalypse-anticipating album that, perhaps paradoxically, was built to last for decades and even centuries to come.&quot; Writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, Eric Henderson called &quot;1999&quot; a &quot;massive, sexy, rump-shaking, and sometimes even disturbing masterpiece&quot; and stated that even though it may not be better than &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, and &quot;Sign o&#x27; the Times&quot;, the album represented a &quot;quantum leap in sophistication and scope.&quot; Henderson also claimed that &quot;1999&quot; raised the bar for &#x27;80s funk.

&quot;1999&quot; has appeared on professional listings of the greatest albums. In 1989, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;1999&quot; 16th on its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s. In 2003, VH1 placed &quot;1999&quot; number 48 in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums. The album was also part of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s list The 50 Most Essential Pop Albums and the magazine listed the album at number 8 on its list of Best Albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was ranked number 163 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It maintained the rating in a 2012 revised list, and was re-ranked number 130 in 2020. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Track listing==
===Original album===


Alternate formats
* Originally released on vinyl as a double LP (the first of a number of double sets from Prince), &quot;1999&quot; was cut to a single vinyl edition in some countries, omitting &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot;, &quot;Automatic&quot;, &quot;All the Critics Love U in New York&quot; and &quot;International Lover&quot;; this single LP was reissued as part of Record Store Day 2018.


Some countries in 1983, such as Brazil and Kenya, opted to issue the release as two separate vinyl albums, &quot;1999 I&quot; and &quot;1999 II&quot;.
* The original compact disc version of the album was also cut, omitting &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot; There is a notice on the back cover of the original compact disc pressing that reads &quot;To enable the release of &quot;1999&quot; as a single compact disc, the song &#x27;D.M.S.R.&#x27; has been omitted from the original LP edition.&quot; Later compact disc pressings (from a 1990 reissue onward) included the track. 
* On the cassette release, &quot;Free&quot; was placed after &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot; to end the first side, balancing out the lengths of both sides of the cassette.

===Remastered, deluxe and super deluxe editions===
The &quot;Remastered&quot; edition contains a remaster of the original album. The &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition contains the remaster and a bonus disc with all the single, maxi-single and promo mixes as well as the B-sides. The &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition contains four more discs: Two of them contain 24 previously unissued studio tracks, the third contains a complete live audio performance of the &quot;1999 Tour&quot; recorded at the late show (the second of two that day) in Detroit, Michigan, on November 30, 1982, and a DVD with another complete, previously unreleased concert from the &quot;1999 Tour&quot;, recorded in multi-cam live at the Houston Summit on December 29, 1982. The albums were also issued on vinyl in a 2 LP, 4 LP and 10 LP + DVD set. The &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition and the &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition are both completely out of print physically.

<text>Hypokalemia is a low level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum. Mild low potassium does not typically cause symptoms. Symptoms may include feeling tired, leg cramps, weakness, and constipation. Low potassium also increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, which is often too slow and can cause cardiac arrest.
Causes of hypokalemia include vomiting, diarrhea, medications like furosemide and steroids, dialysis, diabetes insipidus, hyperaldosteronism, hypomagnesemia, and not enough intake in the diet. Normal potassium levels in humans are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels below 3.5 mmol/L defined as hypokalemia. It is classified as severe when levels are less than 2.5 mmol/L. Low levels may also be suspected based on an electrocardiogram (ECG). The opposite state is called hyperkalemia that means high level of potassium in the blood serum.
The speed at which potassium should be replaced depends on whether or not there are symptoms or abnormalities on an electrocardiogram. Potassium levels that are only slightly below the normal range can be managed with changes in the diet. Lower levels of potassium require replacement with supplements either taken by mouth or given intravenously. If given intravenously, potassium is generally replaced at rates of less than 20 mmol/hour. Solutions containing high concentrations of potassium (&gt;40 mmol/L) should generally be given using a central venous catheter. Magnesium replacement may also be required.
Hypokalemia is one of the most common water–electrolyte imbalances. It affects about 20% of people admitted to hospital. The word &quot;hypokalemia&quot; comes from &quot;hypo-&quot; &#x27;under&#x27; + &quot;kalium&quot; &#x27;potassium&#x27; + &quot;-emia&quot; &#x27;blood condition&#x27;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Mild hypokalemia is often without symptoms, although it may cause elevation of blood pressure, and can provoke the development of an abnormal heart rhythm. Severe hypokalemia, with serum potassium concentrations of 2.5–3 meq/L (Nl: 3.5–5.0 meq/L), may cause muscle weakness, myalgia, tremor, and muscle cramps (owing to disturbed function of skeletal muscle), and constipation (from disturbed function of smooth muscle). With more severe hypokalemia, flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia may result. Reports exist of rhabdomyolysis occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 meq/L. Respiratory depression from severe impairment of skeletal muscle function is found in some people. Psychological symptoms associated with severe hypokalemia can include delirium, hallucinations, depression, or psychosis.

==Causes==
Hypokalemia can result from one or more of these medical conditions:

===Inadequate potassium intake===
Not eating a diet with enough potassium-containing foods or fasting can cause the gradual onset of hypokalemia. This is a rare cause and may occur in those with anorexia nervosa or those on a ketogenic diet.

===Gastrointestinal or skin loss===

A more common cause is excessive loss of potassium, often associated with heavy fluid losses that flush potassium out of the body. Typically, this is a consequence of diarrhea, excessive perspiration, losses associated with crush injury, or surgical procedures. Vomiting can also cause hypokalemia, although not much potassium is lost from the vomitus. Rather, heavy urinary losses of K+ in the setting of post-emetic bicarbonaturia force urinary potassium excretion. (See discussion of alkalosis below.) Other gastrointestinal causes include pancreatic fistulae and the presence of adenoma.

===Urinary loss===
* Certain medications can cause excess potassium loss in the urine. Blood pressure medications such as loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) and thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) commonly cause hypokalemia. Other medications such as the antifungal amphotericin B or the cancer drug cisplatin can also cause long-term hypokalemia. Diuretic abuse among athletes and people with eating disorders may present with hypokalemia due to urinary potassium loss.
* A special case of potassium loss occurs with diabetic ketoacidosis. Hypokalemia is observed with low total body potassium and a low intracellular concentration of potassium. In addition to urinary losses from polyuria and volume contraction, also an obligate loss of potassium from kidney tubules occurs as a cationic partner to the negatively charged ketone, β-hydroxybutyrate.
* A low level of magnesium in the blood can also cause hypokalemia. Magnesium is required for adequate processing of potassium. This may become evident when hypokalemia persists despite potassium supplementation. Other electrolyte abnormalities may also be present.

* An increase in the pH of the blood (alkalosis) can cause temporary hypokalemia by causing a shift of potassium out of the plasma and interstitial fluids into the urine via a number of interrelated mechanisms.1) Type B intercalated cells in the collecting duct reabsorb H+ and secrete HCO3, while in type A intercalated cells protons are secreted via both H+-K+ATPases and H+ ATP-ases on the apical/luminal surface of the cell. By definition, the H+-K+ATPase reabsorbs one potassium ion into the cell for every proton it secretes into the lumen of the collecting duct of a nephron. In addition, when H+ is expelled from the cell (by H+ATP-ase), cations—in this case potassium—are taken up by the cell in order to maintain electroneutrality (but not through direct exchange as with the H+-K+ATPase). In order to correct the pH during alkalosis, these cells will use these mechanisms to reabsorb great amounts of H+, which will concomitantly increase their intracellular concentrations of potassium. This concentration gradient drives potassium to be secreted across the apical surface of the cell into the tubular lumen through potassium channels (this facilitated diffusion occurs in both Type B intercalated cells and Principal cells in the collecting duct).2) Metabolic alkalosis is often present in states of volume depletion, such as vomiting, so potassium is also lost via aldosterone-mediated mechanisms.3) During metabolic alkalosis, the acute rise of plasma HCO3− concentration (caused by vomiting, for example) will exceed the capacity of the renal proximal tubule to reabsorb this anion, and potassium will be excreted as an obligate cation partner to the bicarbonate.
* Disease states that lead to abnormally high aldosterone levels can cause hypertension and excessive urinary losses of potassium. These include renal artery stenosis and tumors (generally nonmalignant) of the adrenal glands, e.g., Conn&#x27;s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). Cushing&#x27;s syndrome can also lead to hypokalemia due to excess cortisol binding the Na+/K+ pump and acting like aldosterone. Hypertension and hypokalemia can also be seen with a deficiency of the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme which allows cortisols to stimulate aldosterone receptors. This deficiency—known as apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome—can either be congenital or caused by consumption of glycyrrhizin, which is contained in extract of licorice, sometimes found in herbal supplements, candies, and chewing tobacco.
* Rare hereditary defects of renal salt transporters, such as Bartter syndrome or Gitelman syndrome, can cause hypokalemia, in a manner similar to that of diuretics. As opposed to disease states of primary excesses of aldosterone, blood pressure is either normal or low in Bartter&#x27;s or Gitelman&#x27;s.

===Distribution away from extracellular fluid===
* In addition to alkalosis, other factors can cause transient shifting of potassium into cells, presumably by stimulation of the Na+/K+ pump. These hormones and medications include insulin, epinephrine, and other beta agonists (e.g. salbutamol or salmeterol), and xanthines (e.g. theophylline). Stimulants (amphetamines, methylphenidate, cocaine) can also cause hypokalemia by stimulating beta-2 receptors.
* Rare hereditary defects of muscular ion channels and transporters that cause hypokalemic periodic paralysis can precipitate occasional attacks of severe hypokalemia and muscle weakness. These defects cause a heightened sensitivity to the normal changes in potassium produced by catecholamines and/or insulin and/or thyroid hormone, which lead to movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the muscle cells.

===Other===
* A handful of published reports describe individuals with severe hypokalemia related to chronic extreme consumption (4–10 L/day) of cola. The hypokalemia is thought to be from the combination of the diuretic effect of caffeine and copious fluid intake, although it may also be related to diarrhea caused by heavy fructose ingestion.

===Pseudohypokalemia===
* Pseudohypokalemia is a decrease in the amount of potassium that occurs due to excessive uptake of potassium by metabolically active cells in a blood sample after it has been drawn. It is a laboratory artifact that may occur when blood samples remain in warm conditions for several hours before processing.

==Pathophysiology==
About 98% of the body&#x27;s potassium is found inside cells, with the remainder in the extracellular fluid including the blood. This concentration gradient is maintained principally by the Na+/K+ pump.

Potassium is essential for many body functions, including muscle and nerve activity. The electrochemical gradient of potassium between the intracellular and extracellular space is essential for nerve function; in particular, potassium is needed to repolarize the cell membrane to a resting state after an action potential has passed. Lower potassium levels in the extracellular space cause hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. This hyperpolarization is caused by the effect of the altered potassium gradient on resting membrane potential as defined by the Goldman equation. As a result, a greater-than-normal stimulus is required for depolarization of the membrane to initiate an action potential.

In the heart, hypokalemia causes arrhythmias because of less-than-complete recovery from sodium-channel inactivation, making the triggering of an action potential less likely. In addition, the reduced extracellular potassium (paradoxically) inhibits the activity of the IKr potassium current and delays ventricular repolarization. This delayed repolarization may promote reentrant arrhythmias.

==Diagnosis==

===Blood===
Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L with levels below 3.5 mmol/L (less than 3.5 mEq/L) defined as hypokalemia.

===Electrocardiogram===
Hypokalemia leads to characteristic ECG changes (PR prolongation, ST-segment and T-wave depression, U-wave formation).

The earliest ECG findings, associated with hypokalemia, are decreased T wave height. Then, ST depressions and T inversions appear as serum potassium levels reduce further. Due to prolonged repolarization of ventricular Purkinje fibers, prominent U waves occur (usually seen at V2 and V3 leads), frequently superimposed upon T waves, therefore producing the appearance of prolonged QT intervals, when serum potassium levels fall below 3 mEq/L.

===Amount===
The amount of potassium deficit can be calculated using the following formula:

Meanwhile, the daily body requirement of potassium is calculated by multiplying 1 mmol to body weight in kilograms. Adding potassium deficit and daily potassium requirement would give the total amount of potassium need to be corrected in mmol. Dividing mmol by 13.4 will give the potassium in grams.

==Treatment==
Treatment includes addressing the cause, such as improving the diet, treating diarrhea, or stopping an offending medication. People without a significant source of potassium loss and who show no symptoms of hypokalemia may not require treatment. Acutely, repletion with 10 mEq of potassium is typically expected to raise serum potassium by 0.1 mEq/L immediately after administration. However, for those with chronic hypokalemia, repletion takes time due to tissue redistribution. For example, correction by 1 mEq/L can take more than 1000 mEq of potassium over many days.

=== Oral potassium supplementation ===
Mild hypokalemia (&gt;3.0 mEq/L) may be treated by eating potassium-containing foods or by taking potassium chloride supplements in a tablet or syrup form (by mouth supplements). Foods rich in potassium include dried fruits (particularly apricots, prunes and figs), nuts, bran cereals and wheat germ, lima beans, molasses, leafy green vegetables, broccoli, winter squash, beets, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, avocados, tomatoes, coconut water, citrus fruits (particularly oranges), cantaloupe, kiwis, mangoes, bananas, and red meats.

Eating potassium-rich foods may not be sufficient for correcting low potassium; potassium supplements may be recommended. Potassium contained in foods is almost entirely coupled with phosphate and is thus ineffective in correcting hypokalemia associated with hypochloremia that may occur due to vomiting, diuretic therapy, or nasogastric drainage. Additionally, replacing potassium solely through diet may be costly and result in weight gain due to potentially large amounts of food needed. An effort should also be made to limit dietary sodium intake due to an inverse relationship with serum potassium. Increasing magnesium intake may also be beneficial for similar physiological reasons.

Potassium chloride supplements by mouth have the advantage of containing precise quantities of potassium, but the disadvantages of a taste which may be unpleasant, and the potential for side-effects including nausea and abdominal discomfort. Potassium bicarbonate is preferred when correcting hypokalemia associated with metabolic acidosis.

=== Intravenous potassium replacement ===
Severe hypokalemia (&lt;3.0 mEq/L) may require intravenous supplementation. Typically, a saline solution is used, with 20–40 meq/L KCl per liter over 3–4 hours. Giving IV potassium at faster rates (20–25 meq/hr) may inadvertently expose the heart to a sudden increase in potassium, potentially causing dangerous abnormal heart rhythms such as heart block or asystole. Faster infusion rates are therefore generally only performed in locations in which the heart rhythm can be continuously monitored such as a critical care unit. When replacing potassium intravenously, particularly when higher concentrations of potassium are used, infusion by a central line is encouraged to avoid the occurrence of a burning sensation at the site of infusion, or the rare occurrence of damage to the vein. When peripheral infusions are necessary, the burning can be reduced by diluting the potassium in larger amounts of fluid, or adding a small dose of lidocaine to the intravenous fluid, although adding lidocaine may increase the likelihood of medical errors. Even in severe hypokalemia, oral supplementation is preferred given its safety profile. Sustained-release formulations should be avoided in acute settings.

=== Potassium-sparing diuretics ===
Hypokalemia which is recurrent or resistant to treatment may be amenable to a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Concomitant hypomagnesemia will inhibit potassium replacement, as magnesium is a cofactor for potassium uptake.

== Popular culture ==
The plot of the science fiction novel &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Road&quot; by Larry Niven centers around the setting&#x27;s scarcity of available potassium, and the resulting deficiency and its effects on the world&#x27;s colonists and their society.

<doc id="972657" wikidata="Q84900" url="?curid=972657" title="Karl-Heinz Grasser">
<text>Karl-Heinz Grasser (born 2 January 1969) is a former Austrian politician (FPÖ at first and later associated with but never officially a member of the ÖVP), who held the office of Austrian Finance Minister from February 2000 to January 2007 as a member of the two subsequent governments of Wolfgang Schüssel. For some time, Grasser was some kind of a jet set person after marrying Fiona Swarovski, the heir of the Swarovski crystal manufacturers in Tyrol, Austria. While at the time praised by many for, in Grasser&#x27;s words &quot;consolidating Austria&#x27;s budget&quot;, he has since then been known for his involvement in major corruption scandals. In 2020, Grasser was sentenced to 8 years in prison for corruption. 

== Early career ==
He was born in Klagenfurt, Carinthia, where he studied business administration at the University of Klagenfurt from 1988 to 1992. He soon joined the far right nationalist Austrian Freedom Party and became the second deputy governor of Carinthia in 1994, but after a dispute with his mentor, Jörg Haider, he left politics to work for Magna Europe as a vice president for human resources and public relations.

== Minister of finance ==
However, in 2000 he returned to politics, when a coalition was formed between the Austrian People&#x27;s Party and the Freedom Party. At that time, he was the youngest minister of finance ever to hold office in Austria. When the coalition broke up in 2002, Grasser left his party, but after national elections in November and the reestablishment of the coalition under the lead of a strengthened People&#x27;s Party, Grasser again became minister, this time being nominated by the People&#x27;s Party.

Grasser remains a controversial figure. While supporters argue that he successfully consolidated Austria&#x27;s budget deficit, critics see him as incompetent and an opportunist. Grasser&#x27;s policies and philosophy as a finance minister suggest a neoliberal stance. He is a self-proclaimed follower of the Austrian School of economics. His immaculate appearance, his smooth-talking dynamism, and his yuppie antics have made him hugely popular with the public.

During the early year of his tenure as Finance Minister, he was generally perceived as the young and competent figure needed to shake up the traditional ways of the ruling parties that were becoming increasingly unpopular. From early on in Grasser&#x27;s tenure as Finance Minister there have been recurring suspicions of backroom deals between Grasser and some of his political and business friends. The first major case was the affair behind the financing of Grasser&#x27;s personal homepage in 2004.

== Corruption trials and conviction ==
Meanwhile, in January 2011, new and continuing investigations by Austrian district attorneys into suspicions of kickback schemes and backroom deals and, in certain cases, alleged manipulation of federal spending figures to syphon money to his allies have brought Grasser in front of the Austrian media once more. These reports have been spearheaded by the Vienna weekly &quot;Der Falter&quot;. More details on the allegations can be found on Wikipedia in German. Grasser maintains his innocence on all counts.

Regardless of the outcome of the large number of court cases filed by district attorneys against Grasser and by Grasser against individuals), it seems clear that his public image as the &quot;new-and-squeaky-clean&quot; politician of a new era has been tarnished once and for all. After Green MP Gabriela Moser and &quot;Falter&quot; published transcripts of police recordings of Grasser&#x27;s telephone conversations with one of his friends, Walter Meischberger, in which Meischberger could not describe the services for which he was paid hundreds of thousands of euros by the Porr construction company, the phrase &quot;Was war meine Leistung?&quot; (What was my service [for that payment]?) entered popular usage. &quot;Falter&quot; arranged a public reading of the transcripts by a group of comedians.

In Austrian quality newspapers, Grasser&#x27;s case is now seen as a test of credibility for the Austrian judicial system: the legal protection from prosecution of former politicians is confronted with rumours about Grasser&#x27;s alleged quagmire of corruption. It will be seen if the Austrian judicial system is up to the task. At present, in an interview by Grasser with the Austrian radio station Ö1 on 22 January 2011, Grasser threatened to sue anyone who criticized his behaviour. &quot;Nothing will come of [any law suit against me]&quot;, Grasser said. Instead, he is suing a number of people and announcing that he will sue others.

On 5 May 2011, new allegations have to come to light. The magazine &quot;Format&quot; quotes from police reports that Grasser, between 2005 and 2007 during his tenure as finance minister of the Republic of Austria, on three occasions personally carried &quot;cases of cash&quot; from Switzerland to Austria. Grasser said that the money was given to him, in cash, by his future mother in law, heiress to the Swarovski Crystal company, a claim she denies.

On 26 May 2011, Austrian Finance police searched ten of Grasser&#x27;s private and business dwellings on suspicion of embezzling up to 3 million euro from the Austrian tax system during and after his time as finance minister. Finance police removed 35 boxes of files, computers and mobile phones. If found guilty, Grasser would face up to ten years in federal prison, would have to pay back the money and face hefty fines in the million euro range (as a percentage of the non-declared income).
Grasser, who was abroad at the time of the searches, maintains his innocence. Delivering messages via his attorney to the Austrian media, Grasser describes the case as a &quot;politically motivated act&quot;.

As of 27 May 2011, the Austrian judiciary has not launched a court challenge against Grasser. Already, this affair has become one of the most opaque and dubious money and embezzlement schemes in the public eye. In August 2013, new details have come to light. Gernot Rumpold, Grasser&#x27;s friend and Freedom party associate, was sentenced to 3 years in federal prison for embezzlement charges (the ruling can still be appealed).

The Austrian monthly magazine &quot;Format&quot;, cites police investigation reports that links Grasser not just to the 500,000 Euros he confessed to bringing, in a suitcase, across the border to Liechtenstein during his tenure as Austrian Federal Minister of Finance, but to a total of 1.6 million Euro that were found in offshore bank accounts (allegedly, as Grasser claims, to make an investment &quot;for his mother-in-law&quot;). In August 2013, Austrian finance police has expressed serious doubt as to the source of the 20 cash transfers amounting to the 1.6 million Euros now identified by Austrian police after almost five years of investigation. The irregularities and sums involved, the fact that substantial sums were directed—always via offshore and Liechtenstein bank accounts or in suitcases—in highly complex investment constructions linked to dummy companies seems to point towards a mesh of corruption and embezzling that might become one of the biggest personal corruption scheme in post-WWII Austria.

On 22 August 2013, the magazine &quot;Format&quot; and Austrian daily newspaper &quot;Der Standard&quot; reported on Grasser potentially facing up to 10 years in prison for tax evasion and tax fraud, in addition to fines that may amount up to 20 million Euros. It has been unheard of in post-WWII Austria that a former minister would potentially face such stiff sentencing, though, after five years of painstaking research into Grasser&#x27;s complex of mailbox companies in offshore locations and in Liechtenstein (which is independent from the Austrian judicial system) by the Austrian Federal Financial Police, Grasser&#x27;s explanation that he did not understand the constructions but followed the advice of his accountant, seem, given his background in Finance and his role as Austrian Finance Minister, doubtful.

In December 2020 he was sentenced to 8 years in prison.

== Departure from politics ==
On 9 January 2007, Grasser announced his departure from politics to return to the private sector. He was considering a position in investment banking at Salomon Smith Barney, of Citigroup, But instead engaged in a number of small-scale lobbying and investment firms, most of which were short-lived, including Meinl International Power, Valora Solutions, SMW OG, and a real estate company GPS.

<text>Borith Lake () is a lake in the Hunza Valley in the Gilgit–Baltistan region of northern Pakistan. Borith lies about above sea level.
== Geography ==
Borith lake lies approximately 2 km to the north of Hussaini, a saline body of water occupying a small hollow at an elevation of 2,500 meters (8,200 feet). The lake can be reached via a 2 km now a paved (car)route from Husseini village, which lies adjacent to Gulmit village. It is also accessible by a 2-3 hour trekking route directly from Gulmit, across the end of the Ghulkin glacier. The site is a sanctuary for migrating wildfowl and is often visited by bird-watchers and nature lovers. To witness the large number of ducks arriving from the warmer parts of southern Pakistan, one should visit between the months of March and June. The birds rest here on their way northwards to the cooler waters of central Asia. Similarly, from September–November, the event occurs in reverse with the onset of winter towards the north.

A one-hour trek each way brings visitors to Hussaini Glacier. Hikers can follow the trekking route towards Borith Lake as far as the edge of the glacier, and return by the same route.
A longer walk to Passu Gar Glacier is another attraction, crossing both Ghulkin Glacier and Borith Lake. Having crossed Hussaini Glacier by the same route, hikers can continue on the southern side of Borith Lake past the settlement of Borith Bala and the now deserted settlement of Shahabad. The lack of a continuous water supply led to the desertification of this village many years ago. The walk takes about 4–5 hours form Ghulkin to Passu. From the glacier, a path leads down to the Karakorum Highway and the Shisper Hotel.

<text>William Frederick Faulds (19 February 1895 – 16 February 1950) was a South African soldier, and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first South African-born man serving with South African Forces to be awarded the VC.

Faulds was born 19 February 1895. When he was 21 years old, and a private in 1st Regiment, 1st South African Infantry Brigade during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 18 July 1916 at Delville Wood, France.

The citation reads as follows:
As a temporary Lieutenant, Faulds was also awarded the Military Cross for actions at Hedicourton 22 March 1918. This citation, for the Military Cross reads:
He later achieved the rank of captain. He served in the Second World War in Italian Somaliland and Abyssinia with Rhodesian forces. He died 16 February 1950 and was buried in Pioneer Cemetery, Harare, Zimbabwe.

Other medals awarded to Faulds were the 1914-1915 Star, the British War Medal 1914-1920, the Allied Victory Medal 1914-1918 (South African issue), the 1939-1945 Star, the Africa Star, the Defence Medal 1939-1945, the War Medal 1939-1945, the Africa Service Medal and the King George VI Coronation Medal 1937.

<text>James Gregory Vaughan Jr. (born June 15, 1973) is an American actor and former fashion model, known for his on and off appearances in roles on the soap operas &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (2002–03), &quot;General Hospital&quot; (2003–09), and &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (2012–). Vaughan also starred as Dan Gordon on the second season of the supernatural series &quot;Charmed&quot; (1999-2000). In 2016, Vaughan began starring in the Oprah Winfrey Network drama series &quot;Queen Sugar&quot; as Detective Calvin.

==Career==
The actor and former male fashion model has starred in soap operas such as &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. To date, his best-known role is that of Lucky Spencer in the latter, which he played from 2003 to 2009.

At age 16, while getting a haircut, he learned of a &quot;Back to School&quot; modeling competition, and sent in some snapshots. He was selected as a finalist but did not win. However, the winner encouraged Vaughan to pursue modeling, and Vaughan signed up with a modeling agency.

Shortly after graduating from Mesquite High School, he was invited to Milan, Italy, where he modeled for designer Giorgio Armani for two and a half months. More campaigns followed, with designers such as Gianni Versace, Tommy Hilfiger, Banana Republic, and Ralph Lauren.

While modeling in Miami, Vaughan started to become dissatisfied with the modeling life, and decided to relocate to pursue his dream of becoming an actor, he then moved to Los Angeles. His first role was on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, as well as on the pilot for a 1996 Aaron Spelling series, &quot;Malibu Shores&quot;, that lead to his future appearances on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and was a cast regular for the second season of &quot;Charmed&quot;.

His next major role was from 2002 to 2003 as Diego Guittierez in the daytime drama &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. When the character was written off the show, Vaughan got a call from the producers of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, who were seeking a new actor for the character of Lucky Spencer, son of the famous soap opera couple Luke and Laura. Vaughan was the first actor to portray Lucky as a full-fledged adult, with the part having been played by Jonathan Jackson and Jacob Young.

On June 7, 2006, Vaughan won the role of the new spokesperson for I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Butter in a ceremony in New York. The contest was created to replace Fabio.

In 2007, Vaughan appeared on &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; to help Tyra Banks through &quot;soap opera school.&quot;

On September 28, 2009, Vaughan announced that he would exit the role of Lucky Spencer on &quot;General Hospital&quot; as the role had been recast with original portrayer Jonathan Jackson; he last aired on October 20 of that year.

In the July 16, 2012, edition of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, it was announced that Vaughan would join the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Eric Brady, who was ordained as a priest before returning to Salem. He first aired on November 13. He departed the role in 2016, and returned from 2017 to 2020, briefly twice in 2021, and since 2022.

In July 2013, Vaughan appeared in &quot;Second Chances&quot;, a Hallmark Original Movie, alongside &quot;Days&quot; co-star Alison Sweeney. The movie was filmed before Sweeney and Vaughn became siblings on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

==Personal life==
Vaughan married Dutch model and actress Touriya Haoud on June 4, 2006. The couple have three sons. During their marriage, they lived in Los Angeles, California and Charlotte, North Carolina. On April 14, 2014, Haoud and Vaughan announced their separation. Their children live with Vaughan in the United States and Haoud moved back to the Netherlands following their divorce.

On December 24, 2019, Vaughan announced his engagement to actress Angie Harmon. In July 2021 Harmon and Vaughan called off the engagement.

<text>The bayan () is a type of chromatic button accordion developed in the Russian Empire in the early 20th century and named after the 11th-century bard Boyan.

==Characteristics==

The bayan differs from western chromatic button accordions in some details of construction:

* Reeds are broader and rectangular (rather than trapezoidal).
* Reeds are often attached in large groups to a common plate (rather than in pairs); the plates are screwed to the reed block (rather than attached with wax).
* The melody-side keyboard is attached near the middle of the body (rather than at the rear).
* Reeds are generally not tuned with tremolo.
* Register switches may be operated with the chin on some larger models (also possible with some larger European button accordions).
* The diminished chord row is shifted, so that the diminished G chord is where one would expect the diminished C chord in the Stradella bass system.
* Converter switches that go from standard preset chords to free bass (individual bass notes) are common on the larger instruments. As opposed to Western conventions, in free bass mode the low notes usually are at the bottom of the instrument and the high notes at the top.
* Newer instruments may feature a register where every tone played actually produces a perfect fifth.

The differences in internal construction give the bayan a different tone color from Western instruments, and the bass has a much fuller sound. Because of their range and purity of tone, bayans are often the instrument of choice for accordion virtuosi who perform classical and contemporary classical music. Two Soviet composers of note who wrote compositions for bayan are Vladislav Zolotaryov and Sofia Gubaidulina. Slovak composer Peter Machajdík composed &quot;Concerto for Two Bayans and Orchestra&quot;, which was premiered by Acco Duo (Miran Vaupotić &amp; Ivana Levak-Vaupotić), with the Symphony Orchestra of the Pomeranian Philharmonic under Alexander Gref, at the Paderewski Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz, Poland on 4 June 2009. Russian Bayan virtuoso Stas Venglevski has premiered contemporary works by Yehuda Yannay, Anthony Galla-Rini and William Susman.

<text>SPAD (&quot;Société Pour L&#x27;Aviation et ses Dérivés&quot;) was a French aircraft manufacturer active between 1911 and 1921. Its SPAD S.XIII biplane was the most produced French fighter airplane of the First World War.

== Deperdussin ==
The company was set up in 1911 as Aéroplanes Deperdussin, becoming the Société de Production des Aéroplanes Deperdussin in 1912. Its founder Armand Deperdussin (born 1867) had been a travelling salesman and a cabaret singer in Liège and Brussels, before making his fortune in the silk business. Deperdussin became fascinated by aviation in 1908, and in 1909 he established an aircraft works at Laon. Deperdussin himself was not a designer, but he hired the engineer Louis Béchereau (1880–1970) as technical director. Béchereau was responsible for Deperdussin and SPAD aircraft designs thereafter.
The first Deperdussin aircraft was an unsuccessful canard, but their next aircraft, the Type A, was an immediate success, and led to a series of closely related monoplanes. Similar to the Nieuport IV and Morane-Saulnier G, this was a popular layout before the First World War. The Deperdussin TT was a considerable export success, and 63 were built by the Lebedev company in Russia and others at Highgate in London by the British Deperdussin Company. From 1911 onward Deperdussin produced aircraft at a new factory at Grenelle, in the suburbs of Paris.
 Factories were also established at Le Havre and Juvisy to build motor boats and waterplanes, as well as three flying schools.

The company also produced a number of notable racing aircraft, including the groundbreaking Deperdussin Monocoque, which won the 1912 and 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy races, set several world speed records and was the first airplane to exceed . The first Schneider Trophy competition, held on 16 April 1913 at Monaco, was won by a Deperdussin floatplane at an average speed of .

== Deperdussin arrested ==

On 6 August 1913, Armand Deperdussin was arrested for fraud. He had developed expensive tastes and in addition to funding competitions such as the Gordon Bennett Cup, he entertained lavishly.
The trading arm of the Comptoir Industrial et Colonial bank discovered that he had been funding this through fraudulently obtained loans using forged receipts from his silk business as security. He remained incarcerated until his trial in 1917. Despite claims that he used much of the money to help develop France&#x27;s aviation expertise, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison, but as a concession for first offenders he was reprieved (&quot;sursis&quot;) and released immediately. Deperdussin committed suicide in 1924.

== SPAD ==

After Armand Deperdussin&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1913 the company went into administration and the name was changed to Société Provisoire des Aéroplanes Deperdussin, the first use of the SPAD acronym. With Deperdussin&#x27;s disgrace, financing stopped and the future of the SPAD company was endangered. A consortium led by Louis Blériot bought the company&#x27;s assets in 1913 and reorganised it as the Société Pour L&#x27;Aviation et ses Dérivés, retaining the SPAD acronym.

The first Béchereau-SPAD designs were unusual two-seat biplanes which attempted to provide a forward-firing machine gun in a tractor configuration aircraft. The pilot sat behind the wings, as in a conventional design, while the observer/gunner was seated in a nacelle, or pulpit, in front of the propeller, attached precariously to the landing gear. These designs, the SPAD A-series of models S.A.1, S.A.2, S.A.3, and S.A.4, were built in small numbers, around sixty each for French (mostly S.A.2) and Russian air forces (mostly S.A.4), and were neither popular nor successful. The availability of the Nieuport 11 and subsequent development of an effective machine gun synchronizer by the French rendered this unusual configuration obsolete.

Other early Béchereau designs for SPAD were less successful. The SE, a large twin-engine biplane bomber, performed well on trials, but it was not ordered.

Béchereau&#x27;s first real success was the SPAD S.VII, which superficially resembled a smaller, neater A.2, without the forward gunner&#x27;s nacelle. Developed from the SPAD V, of which 268 were ordered but none built as SPAD Vs, the SPAD S.VII was a single-seat tractor biplane fighter of simple and robust design powered by the new Hispano-Suiza water-cooled V-8 engine. Compared to earlier fighters, when the SPAD VII appeared in 1916 it was a heavy and unmanoeuvrable aircraft, but pilots learned to take advantage of its speed and strength. Some 3,500 SPAD S.VIIs were built in France, 120 in Britain, and 100 in Russia before their capitulation, although many more had been ordered from a new factory in Yaroslavl, which was not completed until after the Russian Civil War.
Béchereau&#x27;s subsequent wartime designs followed the basic outline of the SPAD S.VII. The two-seaters, the SPAD XI and SPAD XVI, were built in moderate numbers, around 1,000 of each type, but two-seater SPADs were much less successful than the rival Breguet 14 (5,500 built) and Salmson 2 (3,200 built). Single-seat developments of the SPAD VII were more successful. The SPAD XII was a minor variant, the first to use the geared Hispano-Suiza V-8 engine, which allowed it to be armed with a single-shot Hotchkiss cannon (&quot;moteur-canon&quot;) firing through the propeller hub. Tested successfully by ace Georges Guynemer, the conclusion was that only very skilled pilots could exploit its powerful armament. Accordingly, although 300 were ordered, most were completed as normal SPAD fighters, with one (flown by Charles J. Biddle while with the USAAS&#x27; 13th Aero Squadron) and two may have served with the US Air Service in France.

The SPAD S.XIII was essentially an enlarged SPAD S.VII redesigned around a more powerful geared drive Hispano-Suiza engine, as used on the SPAD XII. This was produced in much greater numbers: the exact total is uncertain, with figures from 7,300 to 8,472 being quoted by different sources. Single-seat SPADs were flown by many ace pilots, including Italy&#x27;s Count Francesco Baracca and the United States Army Air Service&#x27;s Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker, with 34 and 26 victories respectively. Georges Guynemer was, as has already been noted, highly successful with the SPAD S.XII, as well as the SPAD S.VII and SPAD S.XIII. At the end of the First World War, all 1,152 single-seat fighters on the strength of French front line air units were SPAD 13s. Nearly 900 SPAD XIII fighters were reported as being used in American service.

Although SPAD had been successful, they were unable to keep up with demand and production of their later fighters was spread out among other aircraft manufacturers, including both direct competitors, as well as numerous companies that would become well known after the war. In 1916, over 98% of SPAD production came from SPAD and Blériot factories. By 1918, this had fallen to 43%, with the majority of SPAD XIII production from licensed manufacturers. SPAD designs accounted for around 20% of French aircraft produced during World War One.

== Blériot-SPAD ==

Post-war the company became Blériot-SPAD. The first of its designs to be known by this name was Bécherau&#x27;s monocoque SPAD S.XX biplane. Despite the prototype being flown in 1918, SPAD 20 deliveries did not begin until 1920 when post war reductions and a preference for the more capable Nieuport-Delage NiD.29 limited orders to 93.

The return of peace also meant that the company had to deal with substantial liabilities under the excess profits tax of 1 July 1916. As modified in 1917, this imposed an 80% tax rate on &quot;excess profits&quot;. With the future uncertain, SPAD was fully incorporated into the Blériot organisation in 1921, and the company effectively disappeared, although a number of Blériot types were marketed as SPADs.

<text>The Brazilian Navy () is the naval service branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces, responsible for conducting naval operations.

The navy was involved in Brazil&#x27;s war of independence from Portugal. Most of Portugal&#x27;s naval forces and bases in South America were transferred to the newly independent country. The government maintained a sizeable naval force in the initial decades following independence. The navy was later involved in the Cisplatine War, the River Plate conflicts, the Paraguayan War as well as other sporadic rebellions that marked Brazilian history.

By the 1880s, the Brazilian Imperial Navy was the most powerful in South America. After the 1893–1894 naval rebellion, there was a hiatus in the development of the navy until 1905, when Brazil acquired two of the most powerful and advanced dreadnoughts of the day which sparked a dreadnought race with Brazil&#x27;s South American neighbours. The Brazilian Navy participated in both World War I and World War II, engaging in anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic.

The modern Brazilian Navy includes British-built guided missile frigates (FFG), locally built corvettes (FFL), coastal diesel-electric submarines (SSK), and many other river and coastal patrol craft.

==Mission==
In addition to the roles of a traditional navy, the Brazilian Navy also carries out the role of organizing the merchant navy and other operational safety missions traditionally conducted by a coast guard. Other roles include:
* Conducting national maritime policy
* Implementing and enforcing laws and regulations with respect to the sea and inland waters.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of the Brazilian Navy date back to the Portuguese naval forces based in Brazil. The transfer of the Portuguese monarchy to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars also resulted in the transfer of a large part of the structure, personnel and ships of the Portuguese Navy. These became the core of the Navy of Brazil.

===Imperial Navy (1822–1889)===
====War of Independence====

The Brazilian Navy came into being with the independence of the country. Some of its members were native-born Brazilians, who under Portuguese rule had been forbidden to serve, while other members were Portuguese born who adhered to the cause of independence and foreign mercenaries. A number of establishments previously created by King João VI of Portugal were incorporated into the navy such as the Department of Navy, Headquarters of the Navy, the Intendancy and Accounting Department, the Arsenal (Shipyard) of the Navy, the Academy of Navy Guards, the Naval Hospital, the Auditorship, the Supreme Military Council, the powder plant, and others. The Brazilian-born Captain Luís da Cunha Moreira was chosen as the first minister of the Navy on 28 October 1822.

British naval officer Lord Thomas Alexander Cochrane was made the commander of the Brazilian Navy and received the rank of &quot;First Admiral&quot;. At that time, the fleet was composed of one ship of the line (&quot;Pedro I&quot;), four frigates, and smaller ships for a total of 38 warships. The Secretary of Treasury Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada created a national subscription to generate capital in order to increase the size of the fleet. Contributions were sent from all over Brazil. Even Emperor Pedro I acquired a merchant brig at his own expense (renamed &quot;Caboclo&quot;) and donated it to the Navy. The navy fought in the north and also south of Brazil where it had a decisive role in the independence of the country. After the suppression of the revolt in Pernambuco in 1824 and prior to the Cisplatine War, the navy increased significantly in size and strength. Starting with 38 ships in 1822, eventually the navy had 96 modern warships of various types with over 690 cannon.

====Cisplatine War and rebellions (1825–1849)====

The Navy blocked the estuary of the Río de la Plata hindering the contact of the United Provinces (as Argentina was then called) with the Cisplatine rebels who wanted Uruguay to join Argentina again or become an independent country, and the outside world. Several battles had occurred between Brazilian and Argentine ships, with Irish-born Argentine admiral William Brown temporarily leading a successful campaign, which had included a significant victory at Juncal. Eventually however, a Brazilian fleet led by English admiral James Norton scored a decisive victory near the island of Santiago in mid 1827, rendering the United Provinces navy combat ineffective and ensuring that the blockade would proceed uncontested. The war came to a stalemate and in 1828, Brazil accepted the resolution guaranteeing the independence of Uruguay. When Pedro I abdicated in 1831, he left a powerful navy made up of two ships of the line and ten frigates in addition to corvettes, steamships, and other ships for a total of at least 80 warships in peacetime. During the 58-year reign of Pedro II the Brazilian Navy achieved its greatest strength in relation to navies around the world. The Arsenal, Navy department, and the Naval Jail were improved, and the Imperial Marine Corps was created. Steam navigation was adopted. Brazil quickly modernized its fleet acquiring ships from foreign sources while also constructing ships locally. Brazil&#x27;s Navy substituted the old smoothbore cannon for new ones with rifled barrels, which were more accurate and had longer ranges. Improvements were also made in the Arsenals (shipyards) and naval bases, which were equipped with new workshops. Ships were constructed in the Naval Arsenal of Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Recife, Santos, Niterói and Pelotas. The Navy also successfully fought against all revolts that occurred during the Regency where it conducted blockades and transported the Army troops; including Cabanagem, Ragamuffin War, Sabinada, Balaiada, amongst others.

When Emperor Pedro II was declared of legal age and assumed his constitutional prerogatives in 1840, the Armada had over 90 warships: six frigates, seven corvettes, two barque-schooners, six brigs, eight brig-schooners, 16 gunboats, 12 schooners, seven armed brigantine-schooners, six steam barques, three transport ships, two armed luggers, two cutters and thirteen larger boats.

During the 1850s the State Secretary, the Accounting Department of the Navy, the Headquarters of the Navy and the Naval Academy were reorganized and improved. New ships were purchased, and the ports administrations were better equipped. The Imperial Mariner Corps was definitively regularized, and the Marine Corps was created, taking the place of the Naval Artillery. The Service of Assistance for Invalids was also established, along with several schools for sailors and craftsmen.

====Platine &amp; Paraguayan wars (1849–1870)====
The conflicts in the Platine region did not cease after the war of 1825. The anarchy caused by the despotic Rosas and his desire to subdue Bolívia, Uruguay and Paraguay forced Brazil to intercede. The Brazilian Government sent a naval force of 17 warships (a ship of the line, 10 corvettes and six steamships) commanded by the veteran John Pascoe Grenfell. The Brazilian fleet succeeded in passing through the Argentine line of defence at the Tonelero Pass under heavy attack and transported the troops to the theater of operations. The Brazilian Armada had a total of 59 vessels of various types in 1851: 36-armed sailing ships, 10 armed steamships, seven unarmed sailing ships and six sailing transports. More than a decade later the Armada was once again modernized, and its fleet of old sailing ships was converted to a fleet of 40 steamships armed with more than 250 cannons. In 1864 the navy fought in the Uruguayan War and immediately afterwards in the Paraguayan War where it annihilated the Paraguayan navy in the Battle of Riachuelo. The navy was further augmented with the acquisition of 20 ironclads and six fluvial monitors. At least 9,177 navy personnel fought in the five years&#x27; conflict. Brazilian naval constructors such as Napoleão Level, Trajano de Carvalho and João Cândido Brasil planned new concepts for warships that allowed the country&#x27;s Arsenals to retain their competitiveness with other nations. All damage suffered by ships was repaired and various improvements were made to them. In 1870, Brazil had 94 modern warships and had the fifth most powerful navy in the world.

====Expansion and the end of the Empire (1870–1889)====
During the 1870s, the Brazilian Government strengthened the navy as the possibility of a war against Argentina over Paraguay&#x27;s future became quite real. Thus, it acquired a gunboat and a corvette in 1873; an ironclad and a monitor in 1874; and immediately afterwards two cruisers and another monitor. The improvement of the Armada continued during the 1880s. The Arsenals of the Navy in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, Pernambuco, Pará and Mato Grosso continued to build dozens of warships. Also, four torpedo boats were purchased.
On November 30, 1883, the Practical School of Torpedoes was created along with a workshop devoted to constructing and repairing torpedoes and electric devices in the Arsenal of Navy of Rio de Janeiro. This Arsenal constructed four steam gunboats and one schooner, all with iron and steel hulls (the first of these categories constructed in the country). The Imperial Armada reached its apex with the incorporation of the ironclad battleships and (both equipped with torpedo launchers) in 1884 and 1885, respectively. Both ships (considered state-of-the-art by experts from Europe) allowed the Brazilian Armada to retain its position as one of the most powerful naval forces. By 1889, the navy had 60 warships and was the fifth or sixth most powerful navy in the world.

In the last cabinet of the monarchic regime, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral José da Costa Azevedo (the Baron of Ladário), left the reorganization and modernization of the navy unfinished. The coup that ended the monarchy in Brazil in 1889 was not well accepted by the Armada. Imperial Mariners were attacked when they tried to support the imprisoned Emperor in the City Palace. The Marquis of Tamandaré begged Pedro II to allow him to fight back the coup; however, the Emperor refused to allow any bloodshed. Tamandaré would later be imprisoned by order of the dictator Floriano Peixoto under the accusation of financing the monarchist military in the Federalist Revolution.

The Baron of Ladário remained in contact with the exiled Imperial Family, hoping to restore the monarchy, but ended up ostracized by the republican government. Admiral Saldanha da Gama led the Revolt of the Armada with the objective of restoring the Empire and allied himself with other monarchists who were fighting in the Federalist Revolution. However, all the attempts at restoration were violently crushed. High-ranking Monarchist officers were imprisoned, banished or executed by firing squad without due process of law and their subordinates also suffered harsh punishments.

===Early republic (1889–1917)===
====Naval revolts====

The military coup that led to the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic (1889), accentuated the decline of shipbuilding in the country. For four decades, between 1890 and 1930 no new ships were built in Brazil. The focus of republican governments was to equip the army to fight internal uprisings in the new regime&#x27;s early years. The Navy was perceived as a threat to the new republican regime, as it had been more loyal to the Monarchy.

The situation became precarious in just over a decade as the Naval Battalion was reduced to 295 soldiers and Imperial Marines to 1,904 men. The equipment and vessels acquired were considered outdated by Navy officials, who criticized the abandonment of repair shops. Naval officers participated in two riots, known as Naval Riots. The second, avowedly monarchist, cost the officers their careers and their lives, without entering the military justice process. The sailors who obeyed orders and took part in the attempt to restore monarchy suffered cruelly.

====South American naval rivalry====

Brazil&#x27;s navy fell into disrepair and obsolescence in the aftermath of the 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Pedro II, after naval officers led a revolt in 1893–94. Meanwhile, the Argentine and Chilean navies were flush with modern warships after the conclusion of a naval arms race between the two. As a result, at the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage.

Rising demand for coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive on the part of prominent Brazilians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but it was two years the Minister of the Navy, Admiral Júlio César de Noronha, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for three small battleships.

After construction began, a new presidential administration took office, and the new government reconsidered their chosen battleship design. This was wrought by the debut of the United Kingdom&#x27;s new dreadnought concept, especially its &quot;all-big-gun&quot; armament that utilized many more heavy-caliber weapons than previous battleships. This warship type would have rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.

As a result, the Brazilian government redirected its naval funds towards three dreadnoughts, of which only two would be built immediately. This move was made with the large-scale support of Brazilian politicians, including Pinheiro Machado and a nearly unanimous vote in the Senate; the navy, now with the large-ship advocate Rear Admiral Alexandrino Faria de Alencar in the influential post of minister of the navy; and the Brazilian press. It made Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom and the United States, and before France, the German Empire, the Russian Empire, and the Empire of Japan. As dreadnoughts were quickly equated with international status, somewhat similar to nuclear weapons today—that is, regardless of a state&#x27;s need for such equipment, simply ordering and possessing a dreadnought increased the owner&#x27;s prestige—the order caused a stir in international relations.

This order led to a naval arms race between Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, which was ended only by the advent of the First World War. Brazil&#x27;s first two dreadnoughts, &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; and &quot;São Paulo&quot;, would be delivered in 1910. The third dreadnought was redesigned multiple times in response to advancing naval technology and financial concerns; it would eventually be sold to the Ottoman Empire and serve with the British as HMS &quot;Agincourt&quot;. A larger super-dreadnought was ordered shortly before the war, but little was accomplished prior to the beginning of the conflict.

====Revolt of the Lash====

In late 1910, a major rebellion known as the Revolt of the Lash, or &quot;Revolta da Chibata&quot;, broke out on four of the newest ships in the Brazilian Navy. The initial spark was provided on 21 November when Afro-Brazilian sailor Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. Many Afro-Brazilian sailors were sons of former slaves, or were former slaves freed under the &quot;Lei Áurea&quot; (abolition) but forced to enter the navy. They had been planning a revolt for some time, and Menezes became the catalyst. Further preparations were needed, so the rebellion was delayed until 22 November. The crewmen of &quot;Minas Geraes&quot;, &quot;São Paulo&quot;, the twelve-year-old , and the new quickly took their vessels with only a minimum of bloodshed: two officers on &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; and one each on &quot;São Paulo&quot; and &quot;Bahia&quot; were killed.

The ships were well-supplied with foodstuffs, ammunition, and coal, and the only demand of mutineers—led by João Cândido Felisberto—was the abolition of &quot;slavery as practiced by the Brazilian Navy&quot;. They objected to low pay, long hours, inadequate training for incompetent sailors, and punishments including &quot;bôlo&quot; (being struck on the hand with a ferrule) and the use of whips or lashes (&quot;chibata&quot;), which eventually became a symbol of the revolt. By 23 November, the National Congress had begun discussing the possibility of a general amnesty for the sailors. Senator Ruy Barbosa, long an opponent of slavery, lent a large amount of support, and the measure unanimously passed the Federal Senate on 24 November. The measure was then sent to the Chamber of Deputies.

Humiliated by the revolt, naval officers and the president of Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service&#x27;s honor. Late on 24 November, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed some smaller warships and the cruiser , &quot;Bahia&quot;″s sister ship with ten guns. They planned to attack on the morning of 25 November, when the government expected that the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125–23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on 26 November.

===First World War (1917–1918)===

After the declaration of war on the Central Powers in October 1917 the Brazilian Navy participated in the war. On 21 December 1917 the British government requested that a Brazilian naval force of light cruisers be placed under Royal Navy control and a squadron comprising the cruisers &quot;Rio Grande do Sul&quot; and &quot;Bahia&quot;, the destroyers &quot;Paraíba&quot;, &quot;Rio Grande do Norte&quot;, &quot;Piauí&quot;, and &quot;Santa Catarina&quot;, and the support ship &quot;Belmonte&quot; and the ocean-going tugboat &quot;Laurindo Pitta&quot; was formed, designated the &quot;Divisão Naval em Operações de Guerra&quot; (&quot;Naval Division in War Operations&quot;). The DNOG sailed on 31 July 1918 from Fernando de Noronha for Sierra Leone, arriving at Freetown on 9 August, and sailing onwards to its new base of operations, Dakar, on 23 August. On the night of 25 August, the division believed it had been attacked by a U-boat when the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Belmonte&quot; sighted a torpedo track. The purported submarine was depth-charged, fired on, and reportedly sunk by &quot;Rio Grande do Norte&quot;, but the sinking was never confirmed.

The DNOG patrolled the Dakar–Cape Verde–Gibraltar triangle, which was suspected to be used by U-boats waiting on convoys, until 3 November 1918 when it sailed for Gibraltar to begin operations in the Mediterranean Sea, with the exception of &quot;Rio Grande do Sul&quot;, &quot;Rio Grande do Norte&quot;, and &quot;Belmonte&quot;. The Division arrived at Gibraltar on 10 November; while passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, they mistook three United States Navy subchasers for U-boats but no damage was caused.

In 1922, at the request of the Brazilian government, the United States established a naval mission in Brazil to advise and improve the Brazilian Navy. The initial staff of 16 officers and 19 petty officers counseled the Brazilians on such topics as gun­nery, naval aviation, destroyer operations, and supply and medicine. The agreement lapsed during the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, but was reestablished in 1932.

=== The Constitutionalist War (1932) ===
Initiating the armed uprising in the State of São Paulo in July 1932, one of the first actions of the legalist forces was the blockade of the Port of Santos, the objective being to prevent the São Paulo state insurgents from obtaining supplies and weapons from abroad. The Brazilian Navy formed a fleet of ships led by the cruiser &quot;Rio Grande Do Sul&quot;, including destroyers &quot;Mato Grosso&quot;, &quot;Pará&quot; and &quot;Sergipe&quot;.

During the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, the cruiser Rio Grande do Sul became the first Brazilian Navy ship to shoot down an aircraft, in this case a Constitutionalist Curtiss Falcon on September 24, 1932. Throughout the conflict, the port of Santos was blocked by the Brazilian Navy, making it impossible for the rebels to receive reinforcements there, the naval ships also carried out naval bombardment of the rebel troops stationed there.

=== Second World War (1942–1945) ===
Despite U-boat operations in the region (centred in the Atlantic Narrows between Brazil and West Africa) beginning autumn 1940, only in the following year did this start to raise serious concern in Washington. This perceived threat caused the US to decide that the introduction of US forces along Brazil&#x27;s coast would be valuable. After negotiations with Brazilian Foreign Minister Osvaldo Aranha (on behalf of dictator Getúlio Vargas), these were introduced in second half of 1941. Germany and Italy subsequently extended their submarine attacks to include Brazilian ships wherever they were, and from April 1942 were found in Brazilian waters. On 22 May 1942, the first Brazilian attack (although unsuccessful) was carried out by Brazilian Air Force aircraft on the . After a series of attacks on merchant vessels off the Brazilian coast by , Brazil officially entered the war on 22 August 1942, offering an important addition to the Allied strategic position in the South Atlantic.
In World War II, Brazil&#x27;s navy was obsolete. In early 1942, German submarines aimed to interdict supplies from reaching Britain and the Soviet Union. Between 1942 and 1944, Brazil&#x27;s navy was supported by the United States Navy. During this period several naval bases were established in the North and Northeast of Brazil, becoming the headquarters of the Allied Command Atlantic South.

Within their limitations and with the refitting and reorganization promoted with American resources, the Brazilian Navy participated actively in the fight against U-boats in the South, Central Atlantic and also the Caribbean. They guarded Allied convoys bound for North Africa and the Mediterranean. Between 1942 and 1945 the navy was responsible for conducting 574 convoy operations protecting 3,164 merchant ships of various nationalities. Enemy submarines managed to sink only three vessels. According to German documentation the Brazilian Navy made over sixty-six attacks against German submarines.

A total of nine U-boats known German submarines were destroyed along the Brazilian coast. Those were: , , , , , , , , and 

About 1,100 Brazilians died during the Battle of the Atlantic as a result of the sinking of 32 Brazilian merchant vessels and a naval warship. Among the 972 dead from the merchant vessels, 470 were crew and 502 were civilian passengers. Besides these, 99 sailors died in the sinking of &quot;Vital de Oliveira&quot; when she was attacked by German submarines, in addition to some 350 deaths in accidents that resulted in the sinking of the corvette &quot;Camaquã&quot; on 21 July 1944. The cruiser &quot;Bahia&quot; was sunk by an explosion on 4 July 1945 which resulted in the deaths of over 300 men.

==== Brazilian fleet (1942–1945) ====
===Cold War period (1945–1988)===

====Lobster War (1961–1963)====
In 1961, some groups of French fishermen who were operating very profitably off the coast of Mauritania extended their search to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, settling on a spot off the coast of Brazil where lobsters are found on submerged ledges at depths of . Local fishermen complained that large boats were coming from France to catch lobster off the state of Pernambuco, so the Brazilian Admiral Arnoldo Toscano ordered two corvettes to sail to the area where the French fishing boats were located. Seeing that the fishermen&#x27;s claim was justifiable, the captain of the Brazilian vessel then demanded that the French boats retreat to deeper water, leaving the continental shelf to smaller Brazilian vessels. The situation became very tense once the French rejected this demand and radioed a message asking for the French government to send a destroyer to accompany the lobster boats, which prompted the Brazilian government to put fleet in a state of alert.

The French Government dispatched a on 21 February to watch over the French fishing boats. The French vessel withdrew after the arrival of a Brazilian warship and the aircraft carrier .

====1964 Coup d&#x27;état====

Although corporal punishment was officially abolished after the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, at the end of 1910, improvement in working conditions and career plans were still contentious in early 1960. The dissatisfaction with officialdom and conservative politicians, coupled with the lack of vision and inability of the general policy of then president João Goulart, led the sailors, encouraged by leaders such as Corporal Anselmo, to the military coup of 1964.

The purges carried out later (not just the navy but for all the armed forces), and the establishment of certain criteria for selection of its new members were a military term in the Brazilian tradition among its members openly harboring various currents of political thought.

The &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; served the Navy until its decommissioning in 2001.

The carrier was commissioned as NAeL &quot;Minas Gerais&quot; (named for Kubitschek&#x27;s home state) on 6 December 1960. She departed Rotterdam for Rio de Janeiro on 13 January 1961. The duration of the refit meant that while the carrier was the first purchased by a Latin American nation, she was the second to enter service, after another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carrier entered service with the Argentine Navy as in July 1959.

===Peacekeeping and SAR missions===

==== AFF447 (2009) ====
Flight 447 was due to pass from Brazilian airspace into Senegalese airspace at approximately 02:20 (UTC) on 1 June, and then into Cape Verdean airspace at approximately 03:45. Shortly after 04:00, when the flight had failed to contact air traffic control in either Senegal or Cape Verde, the controller in Senegal attempted to contact the aircraft. When he received no response, he asked the crew of another Air France flight (AF459) to try to contact AF447; this also met with no success.

The Brazilian Navy also moved three vessels initially, being the patrol vessel &quot;Grajaú&quot;, the frigate and the corvette &quot;Caboclo&quot; to aid in the searches. Subsequently, the tanker and the frigate &quot;Bosisio&quot; were sent, increasing the search force of the navy to five boats.

During the search period, 51 bodies were recovered, more than 600 pieces of the aircraft, as well as passengers&#x27; luggage. A total of 1,344 officers of the Brazilian Navy and eleven vessels, 35,000 miles, were directly involved in the search, rescue and support.

====ARA &quot;San Juan&quot; (2017)====
On 15 November 2017, the submarine &quot;San Juan&quot; in service with the Argentine Navy, stopped communicating during a routine patrol in the South Atlantic off the coast of Argentina. A multi-nation search operation was mounted to try to locate the submarine, which was believed to have suffered an electrical malfunction. Within hours of &quot;San Juan&quot;″s last transmission, reports describe an explosive noise, detected in the vicinity of the vessel&#x27;s last known location.

The frigate &quot;Rademaker&quot;, the submarine relief ship NSS &quot;Felinto Perry&quot; and the polar ship NPo &quot;Almirante Maximiano&quot; of the Brazilian Navy participated in the multinational search for the lost submarine.

===Peacekeeping operations ===
====Haiti====
On 28 May 2004 four Brazilian Navy ships (, , , ) departed from Rio de Janeiro bound for Haiti on a peace mission coordinated by the United Nations (UN). The ships transported part of the military contingent involved in Haitian reconstruction. In addition to 150 Marines and Army troops, the ships carried most of the material for the Brazilian stabilization force — approximately 120 vehicles, 26 trailers of various types, and 81 containers loaded with equipment and supplies. On 28 February 2010, the Brazilian Navy ship sailed from Rio de Janeiro with 900 tons of cargo, including humanitarian aid supplies to earthquake victims in Haiti as well as equipment for the Brazilian military that operates in that country.

Ammunition was brought for Brazilian soldiers in addition to 14 power generators and 30 vehicles, including trucks, ambulances, and armored vehicles. The ship&#x27;s crew consisted of 350 mariners.

====Lebanon====

On 15 February 2011, Brazil assumed command of the Maritime Task Force (MTF) of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
On 4 October, the Brazilian Ministries of Defence and Foreign Relations informed authorities that Brazil was sending a Navy vessel with up to 300 crew members equipped with an aircraft to join the fleet in Lebanon, and the National Congress authorized the ship. On 25 November 2011 the frigate &quot;União&quot; with 239 officers and sailors aboard joined the task force, bringing to nine the number of vessels assisting the Lebanese Navy in monitoring Lebanese territorial waters. The frigate served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Luiz Henrique Caroli of Brazil, who had been Commander of UNIFIL-MTF since February.

On 10 April 2012, the frigate &quot;Liberal&quot; left Rio de Janeiro bound for Lebanon to join the force. It was relieved in January 2013 by the frigate &quot;Constituição&quot; which joined a multinational group comprising nine ships; three from Germany, two from Bangladesh, one from Greece, one from Indonesia and one from Turkey. The crew comprised 250 military officials. The return to Rio was scheduled for August 2013.

On 8 August 2015, the corvette &quot;Barroso&quot; left Rio de Janeiro to replace &quot;União&quot; and later that month carried out maritime interdiction operations and provided training to the Lebanese Navy. On 4 September 2015 it rescued 220 Syrian migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, as reported by the Ministry of Defense in a statement released on its website. The Brazilian ship was sailing towards Beirut in Lebanon when it received an alert from the Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) about a sinking vessel taking immigrants to Europe.

====Combined Task Force 151====

On June 9, 2021, the Brazilian Navy assumed command of the Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, a multinational task force to combat piracy and which protects the global maritime trade in an area covering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden, Somali coast and southern Red Sea.

===Present===
In September 2020, the Brazilian Navy released a new twenty-year strategic plan.

==Brazilian Navy today==

===Personnel===
As of 2020, the Brazilian Navy has a reported strength of 80,500 active personnel, of which approximately 16,000 are naval infantry. The current Navy Commander is Admiral Marcos Sampaio Olsen.

===Ships and submarines===


As of 2012, the Brazilian Navy had about 100 commissioned ships, with others undergoing construction, acquisition and modernization. Between 1996 and 2005 the Navy retired 21 ships. The Brazilian Navy operated one , , formerly the French Navy&#x27;s . It was retired in 2017. Its possible replacements are presently in the early stage of planning and are not expected to be in service until at least 2025.

Four &quot;Tupi&quot;-class and one &quot;Tikuna&quot;-class Type 209 submarines are in the fleet. The &quot;Tupi&quot;-class submarines will be upgraded by Lockheed Martin at a cost of $35 million. The modernization includes the replacement of existing torpedoes with new MK 48 units. On 14 March 2008, the Navy purchased four s from France. The Navy is currently developing its first nuclear submarine. The Navy planned to have the Scorpène-class submarines in service in 2017, and their first nuclear-powered submarine commissioned in 2023.

In August 2008 the Navy incorporated the corvette , which was designed and built in Brazil at a cost of $263 million. In August 2012 the Navy requested four new ships based on the &quot;Barroso&quot; class but using a stealth design.

The PROSUPER program plans to acquire, firstly, five new 6,000-ton frigates, five new offshore patrol vessels and one Logistics Support Vessel.

In January 2012 BAE Systems contracted to supply three patrol vessels that were s. The contract is worth £133m. The offshore patrol vessels are already built, originally ordered by the government of Trinidad and Tobago in a contract which was terminated in 2010. The first vessel was commissioned at the end of June 2012, the second was scheduled for December 2012 and the last for April 2013.
In March 2014, the Brazilian Navy announced plans to domestically build an aircraft carrier, to enter service around 2029. Originally, &quot;São Paulo&quot; was to be modernized until its introduction, but escalating repair costs forced its retirement in February 2017. The carrier will likely be based on an existing project and be built with a foreign partner. French company DCNS has a strong presence in Brazil and is already engaged in building five submarines and a naval base in the country. The company has been showcasing their DEAC Aircraft Carrier project based on the carrier &#x27;s design and aviation systems including launching conventional take-off aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicle integration, advanced conventional propulsion, and platform stabilization systems. American company General Atomics is marketing their Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to Brazil. Possible aircraft to be operated by the carrier may include the Saab Sea Gripen, given that the Air Force has chosen the land-based version as their new jet fighter.

The Brazilian Navy stated in 2018 that they had purchased the helicopter carrier ship from their British counterparts. Rechristened as PHM &quot;Atlântico&quot;, this multi-purpose helicopter carrier is presently the flagship of Brazilian Navy.

===Current Aircraft===

===Marine Corps===
The Brazilian Marine Corps (Portuguese: Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais; CFN) is the land combat branch of the Brazilian Navy.

===Future of the Navy===

The Navy has a large number of active and planned projects, under the modernization plans of the Brazilian Armed Forces, defined in the &quot;National Defense White Paper&quot;.

==Structure and organisation==
===Branches===
The main branches of the Brazilian Navy are:
* The &quot;&quot;Comando de Operações Navais&quot; (Naval Operations Command)
** The &quot;Comando da Força de Superfície&quot; (Surface Force Command)
** The &quot;Comando da Força de Submarinos&quot; (Submarine Force Command)
** The &quot;Comando da Força Aeronaval&quot;&quot; (Naval Aviation Force Command)
** The &quot;&quot;Comando Geral do Corpo de Fuzileiros Navais&quot;&quot; (Marine Corps General Command)
On top of the naval chain of command stands the Commander of the Navy (&quot;Comandante da Marinha&quot; - &quot;CM&quot;) with his directly subordinated administrative units. He also relies on the expertise of the Admiralty (&quot;Almirantado&quot;), which is a collective board without operational functions, but advises the Commander on day to day matters and planning of the service. The Naval Staff (&quot;Estado-Maior da Armada -&quot; &quot;EMA&quot;) is the administrative oversight body of the service. The operational forces of the Brazilian Navy are organized in the Naval Operations Command (&quot;Comando de Operações Navais - ComOpNav&quot;). The structure of the &quot;Marinha do Brasil&quot; completes with five General Directorates and the Marines General Command. These are support organizations in charge of personnel, supply, navigation infrastructure and other tasks not directly connected to naval combat operations.

<text>Gobblet is a board game for two players designed by Thierry Denoual and published in 2001 by Gigamic and Blue Orange Games. Gobblet was a finalist for the 2004 Jeu de l&#x27;année.

The game is played on a 4×4 board. Each player has 12 pieces of the same colour but different sizes. Players take turns to place a piece on the board or move their piece that already is on the board. Bigger pieces can be placed so that they cover smaller ones. A player wins by placing four pieces of the same colour in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

In 2003, Gigamic and Blue Orange Games released Gobblet Junior, a version of the game for younger players, which is played on a 3×3 board.

In 2009, Blue Orange Games published revisioned editions: Gobblet X4 and Gobblet Gobblers to replace Gobblet and Gobblet Jr. accordingly.

<doc id="972699" wikidata="Q5179254" url="?curid=972699" title="Covering a base">
<text>In baseball and softball, part of the infielders&#x27; and pitcher&#x27;s jobs is to cover bases. That is, they stand next to a base in anticipation of receiving the ball thrown from another fielder, so that they may make a play on an opposing baserunner who is approaching that base. On a force play, the fielder covering the base stands with one foot on that base.

In general, the first baseman covers first base, the second baseman or shortstop covers second, the third baseman covers third, and the catcher covers home plate. However, on ground balls hit to the first baseman away from first base, the pitcher will cover first base instead. On a ground ball to either the shortstop or the second baseman, the other of those will cover second base.

With a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the third baseman, second base will be covered by the second baseman, because unlike the shortstop he does not have to turn his back to the third baseman in order to get to second base. Likewise, with a runner on first base, when a ground ball is hit to the first baseman, second base will be covered by the shortstop, who unlike the second baseman does not have to turn his back toward the first baseman in order to get to second base.

When a runner on first base attempts to steal second base, the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base to receive the ball from the catcher. Likewise, when the pitcher attempts to pick off a runner at second base, the shortstop and second baseman will have arranged in advance which one will cover second base.

With baserunners on first and second bases, sometimes the shortstop will cover third base on a bunt, a coverage plan known as the &quot;rotation play&quot; or &quot;wheelplay.&quot; This occurs if the batter bunts the ball toward third base so that the third baseman cannot cover third base because he is moving forward to field the ball.

If the defense is employing an extreme shift, with the shortstop playing on the first-base side of second base and with the third baseman playing near second base (because by reputation the batter is anticipated to hit the ball to the right side of the infield), in some cases the pitcher may need to cover third base.

When the pitcher throws a wild pitch, or when the catcher permits a passed ball, so that in either case the catcher has to retreat farther into foul territory away from home plate to retrieve the ball, if there is a runner on third base the pitcher will cover home plate.

Depending on the situation, however, various fielders can cover any base, and sometimes even an outfielder can cover a base.

== Figurative expression ==
In American English, the expression &quot;cover your bases&quot; used outside of a baseball setting means to be thoroughly prepared for something.

<text>Old Man&#x27;s Child is a Norwegian black metal band originating from the city of Oslo. The band was founded by Galder (formerly known as Grusom; birth name: Thomas Rune Andersen), who is the sole permanent member of the group.

==History==
Old Man&#x27;s Child was officially founded in 1993, but its roots trace back to 1989 when Galder, Jardar, and Tjodalv formed a death/thrash band called &quot;Requiem&quot;. They initially performed covers of songs by Slayer and Metallica, later releasing a demo album in 1990. &quot;Requiem&quot; dissolved in 1992.

In 1996, after releasing their first full-length album, Born of the Flickering, they signed with Century Media. Following the releases of The Pagan Prosperity and Ill-Natured Spiritual Invasion through Century Media, the band embarked on one of their rare tours. Old Man&#x27;s Child has infrequently toured due to constant line-up changes over the years.

In 2000, Galder joined Dimmu Borgir, but he continued to work with Old Man&#x27;s Child. Over the years, the band has evolved into a one-man project, utilizing session musicians for their albums.

Between 2000 and 2005, Galder released three albums: Revelation 666 – The Curse of Damnation (2000), In Defiance of Existence (2003), and Vermin (2005). In July 2008, Old Man&#x27;s Child announced that they were entering the studio to record their seventh album, &quot;Slaves of the World&quot;. It was released in 2009.

In an early 2011 interview, Galder stated that he was firmly focused on the current Dimmu Borgir tour. However, he mentioned that after the world tour, he would begin writing music for Old Man&#x27;s Child, with the possibility of releasing an album in 2012. This did not materialize, and the band entered an extended period of silence during which Galder appeared to maintain his focus on Dimmu Borgir.

In December 2019, however, the group was reactivated, with Galder posting a video on the band&#x27;s Facebook page showing him working on new Old Man&#x27;s Child material—the first such work in over a decade. Galder parted ways with Dimmu Borgir in August 2024, announcing that he would finalize the new album and begin touring with Old Man&#x27;s Child.

<text>A single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), also called Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (G-APD or GM-APD) is a solid-state photodetector within the same family as photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APDs), while also being fundamentally linked with basic diode behaviours. As with photodiodes and APDs, a SPAD is based around a semi-conductor p-n junction that can be illuminated with ionizing radiation such as gamma, x-rays, beta and alpha particles along with a wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet (UV) through the visible wavelengths and into the infrared (IR).

In a photodiode, with a low reverse bias voltage, the leakage current changes linearly with absorption of photons, i.e. the liberation of current carriers (electrons and/or holes) due to the internal photoelectric effect. However, in a SPAD, the reverse bias is so high that a phenomenon called impact ionisation occurs which is able to cause an avalanche current to develop. Simply, a photo-generated carrier is accelerated by the electric field in the device to a kinetic energy which is enough to overcome the ionisation energy of the bulk material, knocking electrons out of an atom. A large avalanche of current carriers grows exponentially and can be triggered from as few as a single photon-initiated carrier. A SPAD is able to detect single photons providing short duration trigger pulses that can be counted. However, they can also be used to obtain the time of arrival of the incident photon due to the high speed that the avalanche builds up and the device&#x27;s low timing jitter.

The fundamental difference between SPADs and APDs or photodiodes, is that a SPAD is biased well above its reverse-bias breakdown voltage and has a structure that allows operation without damage or undue noise. While an APD is able to act as a linear amplifier, the level of impact ionisation and avalanche within the SPAD has prompted researchers to liken the device to a Geiger-counter in which output pulses indicate a trigger or &quot;click&quot; event. The diode bias region that gives rise to this &quot;click&quot; type behaviour is therefore called the &quot;Geiger-mode&quot; region.

As with photodiodes the wavelength region in which it is most sensitive is a product of its material properties, in particular the energy bandgap within the semiconductor. Many materials including silicon, germanium, germanium on silicon and III-V elements such as InGaAs/InP have been used to fabricate SPADs for the large variety of applications that now utilise the run-away avalanche process. There is much research in this topic with activity implementing SPAD-based systems in CMOS fabrication technologies, and investigation and use of III-V material combinations and Ge on Si for single-photon detection at short-wave infrared wavelengths suitable for telecommunications applications.

== Applications ==
Since the 1970s, the applications of SPADs have increased significantly. Recent examples of their use include LIDAR, time of flight (ToF) 3D imaging, PET scanning, single-photon experimentation within physics, fluorescence lifetime microscopy, optical communications (particularly quantum key distribution), and digital night vision.

==Operation==
=== Structures ===
SPADs are semiconductor devices that are based on a p–n junction that is reverse-biased at an operating voltage that exceeds the junction&#x27;s breakdown voltage (Figure 1). &quot;At this bias, the electric field is so high [higher than 3×105 V/cm] that a single charge carrier injected into the depletion layer can trigger a self-sustaining avalanche. The current rises swiftly [sub-nanosecond rise-time] to a macroscopic steady level in the milliampere range. If the primary carrier is photo-generated, the leading edge of the avalanche pulse marks [with picosecond time jitter] the arrival time of the detected photon.&quot; The current continues until the avalanche is quenched by lowering the bias voltage down to or below the breakdown voltage: the lower electric field is no longer able to accelerate carriers to impact-ionize with lattice atoms, therefore current ceases. In order to be able to detect another photon, the bias voltage must be raised again above breakdown.

&quot;This operation requires a suitable circuit, which has to:
# Sense the leading edge of the avalanche current.
# Generate a standard output pulse synchronous with the avalanche build-up.
# Quench the avalanche by lowering the bias down to the breakdown voltage.
# Restore the photodiode to the operative level.

This circuit is usually referred to as a quenching circuit.&quot;

===Biasing regions and current-voltage characteristic===

A semiconductor p-n junction can be biased at several operating regions depending on the applied voltage. For normal uni-directional diode operation, the forward biasing region and the forward voltage are used during conduction, while the reverse bias region prevents conduction. When operated with a low reverse bias voltage, the p-n junction can operate as a unity gain photodiode. As the reverse bias increases, some internal gain through carrier multiplication can occur allowing the photodiode to operate as an avalanche photodiode (APD) with a stable gain and a linear response to the optical input signal. However, as the bias voltage continues to increase, the p-n junction breaks down when the electric field strength across the p-n junction reaches a critical level. As this electric field is induced by the bias voltage over the junction it is denoted as the breakdown voltage, VBD. A SPAD is reverse biased with an excess bias voltage, Vex, above the breakdown voltage, but below a second, higher breakdown voltage associated with the SPAD&#x27;s guard ring. The total bias (VBD+Vex) therefore exceeds the breakdown voltage to such a degree that &quot;At this bias, the electric field is so high [higher than 3×105 V/cm] that a single charge carrier injected into the depletion layer can trigger a self-sustaining avalanche. The current rises swiftly [sub-nanosecond rise-time] to a macroscopic steady level in the milliampere range. If the primary carrier is photo-generated, the leading edge of the avalanche pulse marks [with picosecond time jitter] the arrival time of the detected photon&quot;.

As the current vs voltage (I-V) characteristic of a p-n junction gives information about the conduction behaviour of the diode, this is often measured using an analogue curve-tracer. This sweeps the bias voltage in fine steps under tightly controlled laboratory conditions. For a SPAD, without photon arrivals or thermally generated carriers, the I-V characteristic is similar to the reverse characteristic of a standard semi-conductor diode, i.e. an almost total blockage of charge flow (current) over the junction other than a small leakage current (nano-amperes). This condition can be described as an &quot;off-branch&quot; of the characteristic.

However, when this experiment is conducted, a &quot;flickering&quot; effect and a second I-V characteristic can be observed beyond breakdown. This occurs when the SPAD has experienced a triggering event (photon arrival or thermally generated carrier) during the voltage sweeps that are applied to the device. The SPAD, during these sweeps, sustains an avalanche current which is described as the &quot;on-branch&quot; of the I-V characteristic. As the curve tracer increases the magnitude of the bias voltage over time, there are times that the SPAD is triggered during the voltage sweep above breakdown. In this case a transition occurs from the off-branch to the on-branch, with an appreciable current starting to flow. This leads to the flickering of the I-V characteristic that is observed and was denoted by early researchers in the field as &quot;bifurcation&quot; (def: the division of something into two branches or parts). To detect single-photons successfully, the p-n junction must have very low levels of the internal generation and recombination processes. To reduce thermal generation, devices are often cooled, while phenomena such as tunnelling across the p-n junctions also need to be reduced through careful design of semi-conductor dopants and implant steps. Finally, to reduce noise mechanisms being exacerbated by trapping centres within the p-n junction&#x27;s band gap structure the diode needs to have a &quot;clean&quot; process free of erroneous dopants.

===Passive quenching circuits===
The simplest quenching circuit is commonly called passive quenching circuit and comprises a single resistor in series with the SPAD. This experimental setup has been employed since the early studies on the avalanche breakdown in junctions. The avalanche current self-quenches simply because it develops a voltage drop across a high-value ballast load RL (about 100 kΩ or more). After the quenching of the avalanche current, the SPAD bias slowly recovers to the operating bias, and therefore the detector is ready to be ignited again. This circuit mode is therefore called passive quenching passive reset (PQPR), although an active circuit element can be used for reset forming a passive quench active reset (PQAR) circuit mode. A detailed description of the quenching process is reported by Zappa et al.

===Active quenching circuits===
A more advanced quenching, which was explored from the 1970s onwards, is a scheme called active quenching. In this case
a fast discriminator senses the steep onset of the avalanche current across a 50 Ω resistor (or integrated transistor) and provides a digital (CMOS, TTL, ECL, NIM) output pulse, synchronous with the photon arrival time. The circuit then quickly reduces the bias voltage to below breakdown (active quenching), then relatively quickly returns bias to above the breakdown voltage ready to sense the next photon. This mode is called active quench active reset (AQAR), however depending on circuit requirements, active quenching passive reset (AQPR) may be more suitable. AQAR circuits often allow lower dead times, and significantly reduced dead time variation.

===Photon counting and saturation===
The intensity of the input signal can be obtained by counting (photon counting) the number of output pulses within a measurement time period. This is useful for applications such as low light imaging, PET scanning and fluorescence lifetime microscopy. However, while the avalanche recovery circuit is quenching the avalanche and restoring bias, the SPAD cannot detect further photon arrivals. Any photons, (or dark counts or after-pulses), that reach the detector during this brief period are not counted. As the number of photons increases such that the (statistical) time interval between photons gets within a factor of ten or so of the avalanche recovery time, missing counts become statistically significant and the count rate begins to depart from a linear relationship with detected light level. At this point the SPAD begins to saturate. If the light level were to increase further, ultimately to the point where the SPAD immediately avalanches the moment the avalanche recovery circuit restores bias, the count rate reaches a maximum defined purely by the avalanche recovery time in the case of active quenching (hundred million counts per second or more). This can be harmful to the SPAD as it will be experiencing avalanche current nearly continuously. In the passive case, saturation may lead to the count rate decreasing once the maximum is reached. This is called paralysis, whereby a photon arriving as the SPAD is passively recharging, has a lower detection probability, but can extend the dead time. It is worth noting that passive quenching, while simpler to implement in terms of circuitry, incurs a 1/e reduction in maximum counting rates.

===Dark count rate (DCR)===
Besides photon-generated carriers, thermally-generated carriers (through generation-recombination processes within the semiconductor) can also fire the avalanche process. Therefore, it is possible to observe output pulses when the SPAD is in complete darkness. The resulting average number of counts per second is called &quot;dark count rate&quot; (DCR) and is the key parameter in defining the detector noise. It is worth noting that the reciprocal of the dark count rate defines the mean time that the SPAD remains biased above breakdown before being triggered by an undesired thermal generation. Therefore, in order to work as a single-photon detector, the SPAD must be able to remain biased above breakdown for a sufficiently long time (e.g., a few milliseconds, corresponding to a count rate well under a thousand counts per second, cps).

=== Afterpulsing noise ===
One other effect that can trigger an avalanche is known as afterpulsing. When an avalanche occurs, the PN junction is flooded with charge carriers and trap levels between the valence and conduction band become occupied to a degree that is much greater than that expected in a thermal-equilibrium distribution of charge carriers. After the SPAD has been quenched, there is some probability that a charge carrier in a trap level receives enough energy to free it from the trap and promote it to the conduction band, which triggers a new avalanche. Thus, depending on the quality of the process and exact layers and implants that were used to fabricate the SPAD, a significant number of extra pulses can be developed from a single originating thermal or photo-generation event. The degree of afterpulsing can be quantified by measuring the autocorrelation of the times of arrival between avalanches when a dark count measurement is set up. Thermal generation produces Poissonian statistics with an impulse function autocorrelation, and afterpulsing produces non-Poissonian statistics.

=== Photon timing and jitter ===
The leading edge of a SPAD&#x27;s avalanche breakdown is particularly useful for timing the arrival of photons. This method is useful for 3D imaging, LIDAR and is used heavily in physical measurements relying on time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). However, to enable such functionality dedicated circuits such as time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and time-to-analogue (TAC) circuits are required. The measurement of a photon&#x27;s arrival is complicated by two general processes. The first is the statistical fluctuation in the arrival time of the photon itself, which is a fundamental property of light. The second is the statistical variation in the detection mechanism within the SPAD due to a) depth of photon absorption, b) diffusion time to the active p-n junction, c) the build up statistics of the avalanche and d) the jitter of the detection and timing circuitry.

===Optical fill factor===
For a single SPAD, the ratio of its optically sensitive area, Aact, to its total area, Atot, is called the fill factor, . As SPADs require a guard ring to prevent premature edge breakdown, the optical fill factor becomes a product of the diode shape and size with relation its guard ring. If the active area is large and the outer guard ring is thin, the device will have a high fill factor. With a single device, the most efficient method to ensure full utilisation of the area and maximum sensitivity is to focus the incoming optical signal to be within the device&#x27;s active area, i.e. all incident photons are absorbed within the planar area of the p-n junction such that any photon within this area can trigger an avalanche.

Fill factor is more applicable when we consider arrays of SPAD devices. Here the diode active area may be small or commensurate with the guard ring&#x27;s area. Likewise, the fabrication process of the SPAD array may put constraints on the separation of one guard ring to another, i.e. the minimum separation of SPADs. This leads to the situation where the area of the array becomes dominated by guard ring and separation regions rather than optically receptive p-n junctions. The fill factor is made worse when circuitry must be included within the array as this adds further separation between optically receptive regions. One method to mitigate this issue is to increase the active area of each SPAD in the array such that guard rings and separation are no longer dominant, however for CMOS integrated SPADs the erroneous detections caused by dark counts increases as the diode size increases.

==== Geometric improvements ====
One of the first methods to increase fill factors in arrays of circular SPADs was to offset the alignment of alternate rows such that the curve of one SPAD partially uses the area between the two SPADs on an adjacent row. This was effective but complicated the routing and layout of the array.

To address fill factor limitations within SPAD arrays formed of circular SPADs, other shapes are utilised as these are known to have higher maximum area values within a typically square pixel area and have higher packing ratios. A square SPAD within a square pixel achieves the highest fill factor, however the sharp corners of this geometry are known to cause premature breakdown of the device, despite a guard ring and consequently produce SPADs with high dark count rates. To compromise, square SPADs with sufficiently rounded corners have been fabricated. These are termed Fermat shaped SPADs while the shape itself is a super-ellipse or a Lamé curve. This nomenclature is common in the SPAD literature, however the Fermat curve refers to a special case of the super-ellipse that puts restrictions on the ratio of the shape&#x27;s length, &quot;a&quot; and width, &quot;b&quot; (they must be the same, a = b = 1) and restricts the degree of the curve &quot;n&quot; to be even integers (2, 4, 6, 8 etc). The degree &quot;n&quot; controls the curvature of the shape&#x27;s corners. Ideally, to optimise the shape of the diode for both low noise and a high fill factor, the shape&#x27;s parameters should be free of these restrictions.

To minimise the spacing between SPAD active areas, researchers have removed all active circuitry from the arrays and have also explored the use of NMOS only CMOS SPAD arrays to remove SPAD guard ring to PMOS n-well spacing rules. This is of benefit but is limited by routing distances and congestion into the centre SPADs for larger arrays. The concept has been extended to develop arrays that use clusters of SPADs in so-called mini-SiPM arrangements whereby a smaller array is provided with its active circuitry at one edge, allowing a second small array to be abutted on a different edge. This reduced the routing difficulties by keeping the number of diodes in the cluster manageable and creating the required number of SPADs in total from collections of those clusters.

A significant jump in fill factor and array pixel pitch was achieved by sharing the deep n-well of the SPADs in CMOS processes, and more recently also sharing portions of the guard-ring structure. This removed one of the major guard-ring to guard-ring separation rules and allowed the fill-factor to increase towards 60 or 70%. The n-well and guard ring sharing idea has been crucial in efforts towards lowering pixel pitch and increasing the total number of diodes in the array. Recently SPAD pitches have been reduced to 3.0 um and 2.2 um.

Porting a concept from photodiodes and APDs, researchers have also investigated the use of drift electric fields within the CMOS substrate to attract photo generated carriers towards a SPAD&#x27;s active p-n junction. By doing so a large optical collection area can be achieved with a smaller SPAD region.

Another concept ported from CMOS image sensor technologies, is the exploration of stacked p-n junctions similar to Foveon sensors. The idea being that higher-energy photons (blue) tend to be absorbed at a short absorption depth, i.e. near the silicon surface. Red and infra-red photons (lower energy) travel deeper into the silicon. If there is a junction at that depth, red and IR sensitivity can be improved.

==== IC fabrication improvements ====
With the advancement of 3D IC technologies, i.e. stacking of integrated circuits, the fill factor could be enhanced further by allowing the top die to be optimised for a high fill-factor SPAD array, and the lower die for readout circuits and signal processing. As small dimension, high-speed processes for transistors may require different optimisations than optically sensitive diodes, 3D-ICs allow the layers to be separately optimised.

==== Pixel-level optical improvements ====
As with CMOS image sensors micro-lenses can be fabricated on the SPAD pixel array to focus light into the centre of the SPAD. As with a single SPAD, this allows light to only hit the sensitive regions and avoid both the guard ring and any routing that is needed within the array. This has also recently included Fresnel type lenses.

==== Pixel pitch ====
The above fill-factor enhancement methods, mostly concentrating on SPAD geometry along with other advancements, have led SPAD arrays to recently push the 1 mega pixel barrier. While this lags CMOS image sensors (with pitches now below 0.8 um), this is a product of both the youth of the research field (with CMOS SPADs introduced in 2003) and the complications of high voltages, avalanche multiplication within the silicon and the required spacing rules.

==Comparison with APDs==
While both APDs and SPADs are semiconductor p-n junctions that are heavily reverse biased, the principle difference in their properties is derived from their different biasing points upon the reverse I-V characteristic, i.e. the reverse voltage applied to their junction. An APD, in comparison to a SPAD, is not biased above its breakdown voltage. This is because the multiplication of charge carriers is known to occur prior to the breakdown of the device with this being utilised to achieve a stable gain that varies with the applied voltage. For optical detection applications, the resulting avalanche and subsequent current in its biasing circuit is linearly related to the optical signal intensity. The APD is therefore useful to achieve moderate up-front amplification of low-intensity optical signals but is often combined with a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) as the APD&#x27;s output is a current rather than the voltage of a typical amplifier. The resultant signal is a non-distorted, amplified version of the input, allowing for the measurement of complex processes that modulate the amplitude of the incident light. The internal multiplication gain factors for APDs vary by application, however typical values are of the order of a few hundred. The avalanche of carriers is not divergent in this operating region, while the avalanche present in SPADs quickly builds into a run-away (divergent) condition.

In comparison, SPADs operate at a bias voltage above the breakdown voltage. This is such a highly unstable above-breakdown regime that a single photon or a single dark-current electron can trigger a significant avalanche of carriers. The semiconductor p-n junction breaks down completely, and a significant current is developed. A single photon can trigger a current spike equivalent to billions of billions of electrons per second (with this being dependent on the physical size of the device and its bias voltage). This allows subsequent electronic circuits to easily count such trigger events. As the device produces a trigger event, the concept of gain is not strictly compatible. However, as the photon detection efficiency (PDE) of SPADs varies with the reverse bias voltage, gain, in a general conceptual sense can be used to distinguish devices that are heavily biased and therefore highly sensitive in comparison to lightly biased and therefore of lower sensitivity. While APDs can amplify an input signal preserving any changes in amplitude, SPADs distort the signal into a series of trigger or pulse events. The output can still be treated as proportional to the input signal intensity, however it is now transformed into the frequency of trigger events, i.e. pulse frequency modulation (PFM). Pulses can be counted giving an indication of the input signal&#x27;s optical intensity, while pulses can trigger timing circuits to provide accurate time-of-arrival measurements.

One crucial issue present in APDs is multiplication noise induced by the statistical variation of the avalanche multiplication process. This leads to a corresponding noise factor on the output amplified photo current. Statistical variation in the avalanche is also present in SPAD devices, however due to the runaway process it is often manifest as timing jitter on the detection event.

Along with their bias region, there are also structural differences between APDs and SPADs, principally due to the increased reverse bias voltages required and the need for SPADs to have a long quiescent period between noise trigger events to be suitable for the single-photon level signals to be measured.

==History, development and early pioneers==
The history and development of SPADs and APDs shares a number of important points with the development of solid-state technologies such as diodes and early p–n junction transistors (particularly war-efforts at Bell Labs). John Townsend in 1901 and 1903 investigated the ionisation of trace gases within vacuum tubes, finding that as the electric potential increased, gaseous atoms and molecules could become ionised by the kinetic energy of free electrons accelerated though the electric field. The new liberated electrons were then themselves accelerated by the field, producing new ionisations once their kinetic energy has reached sufficient levels. This theory was later instrumental in the development of the thyratron and the Geiger-Mueller tube. The Townsend discharge was also instrumental as a base theory for electron multiplication phenomena, (both DC and AC), within both silicon and germanium.

However, the major advances in early discovery and utilisation of the avalanche gain mechanism were a product of the study of Zener breakdown, related (avalanche) breakdown mechanisms and structural defects in early silicon and germanium transistor and p–n junction devices. These defects were called &#x27;microplasmas&#x27; and are critical in the history of APDs and SPADs. Likewise investigation of the light detection properties of p–n junctions is crucial, especially the early 1940s findings of Russel Ohl. Light detection in semiconductors and solids through the internal photoelectric effect is older with Foster Nix pointing to the work of Gudden and Pohl in the 1920s, who use the phrase primary and secondary to distinguish the internal and external photoelectric effects respectively. In the 1950s and 1960s, significant effort was made to reduce the number of microplasma breakdown and noise sources, with artificial microplasmas being fabricated for study. It became clear that the avalanche mechanism could be useful for signal amplification within the diode itself, as both light and alpha particles were used for the study of these devices and breakdown mechanisms.

In the early 2000s, SPADs have been implemented within CMOS processes. This has radically increased their performance (dark count rate, jitter, array pixel pitch, etc.), and has leveraged analog and digital circuits that can be implemented alongside these devices. Notable circuits include photon counting using fast digital counters, photon timing using both time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and time-to-analog converters (TACs), passive quenching circuits using either NMOS or PMOS transistors in place of poly-silicon resistors, active quenching and reset circuits for high counting rates, and many on-chip digital signal processing blocks. Such devices are now reaching optical fill factors of &gt;70%, with &gt;1024 SPADs, with DCRs &lt; 10 Hz, jitter values in the 50ps region, and dead times of 1-2ns. Recent devices leverage 3D-IC technologies such as through-silicon-vias (TSVs) to present a high-fill-factor SPAD optimised top CMOS layer (90 nm or 65 nm node) with a dedicated signal processing and readout CMOS layer (45 nm node). Significant advancements in the noise terms for SPADs have been obtained by silicon process modelling tools such as TCAD, where guard rings, junction depths and device structures and shapes can be optimised prior to validation by experimental SPAD structures.

<text>The Central Midlands Alliance is an English football league covering the northeast-central part of England. Formed in 1971 as the South Derbyshire League, changing name initially to the Derbyshire League before changing to the Central Midlands League in 1983, it covers parts of Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and Staffordshire, although Sheffield-based teams play in the Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire County Senior Football League. The league&#x27;s current sponsor is Abacus Lighting. Upon merging with the Midland Regional Alliance in 2023, the current name was adopted. The number of divisions has varied over time as follows

*1983–84: Premier, Premier First, Senior and First
*1984–85 to 1985–86: Premier, Central, Senior and First
*1986–87 to 1987–88: Supreme, Premier, First and Second
*1988–89 to 1990–91: Supreme, Premier and First
*1991–92: Supreme, Premier North and Premier South
*1992–93 to 2010–11: Supreme and Premier
*2011–12 to 2012–13: North and South
*2012–13 to 2014–15: North, South, Reserve Supreme and Reserve Premier
*2015–16 to 2016–17: North, South, Reserve Division
*2017–18 to 2018–19: North, South, Reserve Supreme and Division One
*2018–19 to 2019–20: North, South, Division One North and South
*2019–20 to 2021–22: North, South, Division One North, South and Central
*2022–23: North, South, Division One North, East and West
*2023–24 onwards: North, South, Division One North, South, East and West and Division 2

Within the English football league system, the Central Midlands League&#x27;s top two divisions, called the &quot;North Division&quot; and &quot;South Division&quot;, were considered part of the National League System (at Step 7) until 2020, when they were redesignated as NLS county feeders. Four clubs from the previously-named Premier Division had the distinction of being the lowest-ranked clubs, and only ones outside the NLS, accepted for the 2006–07 FA Vase. For the 2008–09 season, eight of the leading sides left the Central Midlands League to join forces with eight clubs from the Leicestershire Senior League to form a new league, the East Midlands Counties League, at Step 6 of the National League System. For the 2015–16 season reserve teams of clubs who play higher up the pyramid were allowed to participate in the league for the first time.

One club per season from the North and South Divisions may be promoted (subject to ground standards and a top five finish) to either the Northern Counties East League Division One or United Counties League Division One. Some clubs have progressed from the CML to the National League North and Northern Premier League. A representative side from the league takes part in the FA Inter-League Cup.

<text>Milnathort is a small town in the parish of Orwell in the county of Kinross-shire, Scotland and since 1996, the local council area of Perth and Kinross. The smaller neighbour of nearby Kinross, Milnathort has a population of around 2,000 people. It is situated amidst countryside at the foot of the Ochil Hills, and near the north shore of Loch Leven. From 1977 it became more easily accessible due to the development of the M90 motorway. The name comes from the Gaelic &quot;maol coirthe&quot; meaning &quot;bare hill of the standing stones&quot;.

==Amenities==

Milnathort&#x27;s amenities are typical of a small Scottish town with a nine-hole golf course, a park, countryside bike path, primary school, a range of pubs, cafés and a shop selling ice cream. Milnathort Town Hall was completed in 1855.

==Church==
The main church in Milnathort was built as a Secessionist Church in the north of the town and known as the Orwell Church which was built as a chapel in 1741 by the Old Light Burghers and rebuilt in 1821. It amalgamated briefly with the Church of Scotland in 1839 before transferring to the Free Church of Scotland in 1843. The manse was erected by the Free church in 1850 to house Rev James Thornton (1791-1874). The most notable minister was Walter Chalmers Smith.

==Schools==
The only school is Milnathort Primary School. The high school is Loch Leven Community Campus, just outside the town.

==Notable people==
*John Calder, publisher
*Prof David Hepburn FRSE, anatomist, President of the Anatomical Society 1916–1918.
*Laura Muir, middle-distance runner
*Lucinda Russell, 2017 and 2023 Grand National-winning horse trainer

<text>Euripides&#x27; Electra (, &quot;Ēlektra&quot;) is a tragedy probably written in the mid 410s BC, likely before 413 BC. A version of the myth of the house of Atreus, Euripides&#x27; play reworks important aspects of the story found in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy (especially the second play, &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;) and also in Sophocles&#x27; Electra, although the relative dating of Euripides&#x27; and Sophocles&#x27; plays remain uncertain. In his tragedy, Euripides introduces startling and disturbing elements that ask his audience (and readers) to question the nature of tragic &#x27;heroism,&#x27; assumptions of appropriate gender behavior, and the morality of both human characters and the gods. 

==Background==
Years before the start of the play, at the outset of the Trojan War, the Greek general Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigeneia in order to appease the goddess Artemis. While his sacrifice allows the Greek army to sail for Troy, it leads to deep resentment from his wife, Clytemnestra, who also has born Agamemnon&#x27;s other children, Orestes and Electra. When Agamemnon returns victorious from the Trojan War ten years later, Clytemnestra (in some versions, helped by her lover Aegisthus) murder him in the bath. Orestes goes into exile, while Electra remains in the palace, under the thumb of her mother and Aegisthus, the new rulers in Argos.

==Plot==
The play opens with a prologue delivered by a poor farmer, who informs us that he is the erstwhile husband of Electra. When Electra reached marriageable age, Aegisthus feared that a noble husband would father children who might revenge Agamemnon&#x27;s murder. So he and Clytemnestra marry off Electra to this poor Mycenaean, who treats her kindly, honors her royal lineage, and respects her virginity. While lamenting her father&#x27;s murder and her loss of status, Electra helps her husband with the household chores, going off to fetch water from the spring. 

After Agamemnon&#x27;s murder, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus send Orestes to Phocis, where he befriends the king&#x27;s son, Pylades. Now grown, Orestes returns to Argos with Pylades, and he seeks out news of his sister Electra and considers how to revenge their father Agamemnon&#x27;s murder. They come to a poor hillside cottage that turns out to be Electra and the farmer&#x27;s home. Claiming to bring a message from her brother, Orestes keeps his identity hidden, even after he determines Electra&#x27;s loyalty and her commitment to avenge Agamemnon&#x27;s murder. Sent for by Electra, the aged servant of the family arrives at her homestead, and he &quot;outs&quot; Orestes when he recognizing him by the scar on his brow.

Joyfully reunited, brother and sister plot how they will murder both Aegisthus and Clytemnestra. The old servant explains that Aegisthus is currently in country where his horses pasture, preparing a sacrifice and feast. Before Orestes and Pylades go to confront Aegisthus, Electra sends the old servant to tell Clytemnestra that she had a son ten days ago, knowing this will bring Clytemnestra to her house. A messenger arrives and describes Orestes’ murder of Aegisthus during the sacrifice. Orestes and Pylades return with the corpse, and Electra delivers a vindictive speech over the body. When Orestes sees Clytemnestra approaching in a wagon, he wavers in his commitment to murder her. Electra shames her brother, and he hides in the cottage awaiting the inevitable. Mother and daughter alternate speeches of accusation, until Clytemnestra is invited into the cottage to help Electra with the birth ritual for her (fictional) newborn. Helped by Electra, Orestes kills their mother with a sword.

The two leave the house, filled with grief and guilt. As they lament, Clytemnestra&#x27;s deified brothers, Castor and Pollux, appear. They tell Electra and Orestes that their mother received just punishment but their matricide was still a shameful act, and they instruct the siblings on what they must do to atone and purge their souls.

==Aeschylean parody and Homeric allusion==
The enduring popularity of Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy (produced in 458 BC) is evident in Euripides&#x27; construction of the recognition scene between Orestes and Electra, which mocks Aeschylus&#x27; play. In &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (whose plot is roughly equivalent to the events in &quot;Electra&quot;), Electra recognizes her brother by a series of tokens: a lock of his hair, a footprint he leaves at Agamemnon&#x27;s grave, and an article of clothing she had made for him years earlier. Euripides&#x27; own recognition scene clearly ridicules Aeschylus&#x27; account. In Euripides&#x27; play (510ff.), Electra laughs at the idea of using such tokens to recognize her brother because: there is no reason their hair should match; Orestes&#x27; footprint would in no way resemble her smaller footprint; and it would be illogical for a grown Orestes to still have a piece of clothing made for him when he was a small child.

Orestes is instead recognized from a scar he received on the forehead while chasing a doe in the house as a child (571-74). This is a mock-heroic allusion to a scene from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In &quot;Odyssey&quot; 19.428-54, the nurse Eurycleia recognizes a newly returned Odysseus from a scar on his thigh that he received as a child while on his first boar hunt. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Orestes&#x27; return to Argos and taking revenge for his father&#x27;s death is held up several times as a model for Telemachus&#x27; behavior (see &quot;Telemachy&quot;). Euripides in turn uses his recognition scene to allude to the one in &quot;Odyssey&quot; 19. Instead of an epic heroic boar hunt, Euripides instead invents a semi-comic incident involving a fawn.

<text>James Wayne Wood (August 9, 1924 – January 1, 1990), (Col, USAF), was an American aeronautical engineer, U.S. Air Force officer, test pilot, and astronaut in the X-20 Dyna-Soar program.

==Early life and education==
Wood was born on August 9, 1924, in Paragould, Arkansas. He considered Pueblo, Colorado his home town. Wood earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1954. He was married and had three children.

==Test pilot==

Wood served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, and flew 10 combat missions. In the Korean War, he flew more than 100 combat missions.

As a USAF Test Pilot School graduate, he was serving as an experimental test pilot at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB, California when selected for the X-20 Dyna-Soar program in April 1960. However, before his selection, he had been an unsuccessful applicant for NASA Astronaut Group 1. Wood was the senior test pilot on the Dyna-Soar project and was slated to be the pilot on its first sub-orbital mission. If the program had not been cancelled, the first drop test would have been in July 1964. After the Dyna-Soar program was cancelled on December 10, 1963, he remained with the U.S. Air Force and served as Commander of Test Operations at Edwards Air Force Base until 1978. He retired from the U.S. Air Force with the rank of colonel. Wood later was test pilot and Director of Operations, Tracor Flight Systems Inc., in Newport Beach, California.

Wood served as the 1975 president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and was a Fellow of the organization.

==Death==
Wood died in Melbourne, Florida, on January 1, 1990, of natural causes, aged 65.

<text>The Globigerinina is a suborder of foraminiferans that are found as marine plankton. They produce hyaline calcareous tests, and are known as fossils from the Jurassic period onwards. The group has included more than 100 genera and over 400 species, of which about 30 species are extant. One of the most important genera is &quot;Globigerina&quot;; vast areas of the ocean floor are covered with &quot;Globigerina&quot; ooze (named by Murray and Renard in 1873), dominated by the shells of planktonic forms.

==Description==
Globigerinids are characterized by distinctly perforate planispiral or trochospiral tests composed of lamellar radial hyaline (glassy) calcite, with typically globular chambers and single interiomarginal aperture. Some however have multiple or auxiliary apertures, and in some the aperture is areal or terminal in location. Some, also, have keels, reinforcing thickenings along exterior angles. An adaptation to the planktonic habit is the development of long narrow spines that support a frothy buoyant ectoplasm.

==Superfamilies and families==
The Globigerinina are now divided into these superfamilies and families:

* superfamily Globigerinitoidea
** family Globigerinitidae
* superfamily Globigerinoidea
** family Globigerinidae 
** family Hastigerinidae

<text>Lydiate is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton on Merseyside, England but historically in Lancashire. It is located north of Maghull, with which it has a common history. At the 2001 Census the civil parish of Lydiate had a population of 6,672, reducing to 6,308 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

There is evidence that the settlement of the area dates back to at least the middle of the 10th century. Indeed, one possible root of the name is the Old English &quot;hlid-geat&quot; meaning &#x27;swing gate&#x27;, which would have an association with animal farming. Lydiate is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, and is described as having a &quot;wood a mile long&quot;, and there is evidence of the existence of extensive forests at that time, particularly of oak and elm.

The Scotch Piper Inn, located today on the A5147, Southport Road, is reputed to be the oldest inn in Lancashire and dates from the 14th century. For many years the pub was owned and run by the Moorcroft family. Originally called the &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, the inn was built around an oak tree which can be seen in both the tap room and the front bar to the left of the fireplace. The inn is now a Grade II* listed building.

The Ireland family were very influential in the area in the early 15th century, and Lydiate Hall was built by Lawrence Ireland sometime around 1470. The eastern part of the hall was destroyed about 1780, and the hall was abandoned completely by the late 19th century. Only ruins exist today.

The nearby St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, commonly known as Lydiate Abbey, appears to date from the same period, with the initials of Lawrence Ireland and his wife, Catherine Blundell, located on the porch. The abbey appears to have been abandoned when the practice of the Catholic religion was prohibited. The graveyard within the curtilage of the chapel was used by local Catholic families into the later 19th century.

==Governance==

From 1997 until 2010 the village and civil parish of Lydiate was part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency represented by George Howarth, a Labour Party MP.

As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency was abolished with Sefton East, including Lydiate, being merged with the northern parts of the former Crosby constituency, which was also abolished, to form the new Sefton Central constituency which is represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

==Geography==
The south of the village is suburban in nature with residences and some light industry. The remainder of the village, especially to the north and west, is more rural, consisting largely of flat arable land.

The parish church of St Thomas and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady are situated at the very north of Lydiate. The Catholic Church of St Gregory the Great is situated further south, off Liverpool Road. St Thomas CE Primary School, St Gregory&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and Lydiate Primary School, formerly Lydiate County Primary, often know because of its location as Lambshear Lane Primary School, also lie within the village.

The Weld Blundell (pronounced &quot;Well Blundell&quot;) pub is opposite Lydiate&#x27;s village green, which is little more than a few square metres in area and has a bus stop. The Weld Blundell in Lydiate shares its name with an establishment of the same name in Ince Blundell, now demolished and the site developed into a petrol station and coffee shop.

The Running Horses in Bells Lane was owned and run for many years by three generations of the Walton Family. It lies right beside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. There was a coal business at the side, also run by the Walton family. At one time the coal was delivered by barge along the canal.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village on its way to the Liverpool Pier Head. The A59 road (Northway) and A5147 road (Southport Road) also run through the village. Until 1952 Lydiate was served by the Southport &amp; Cheshire Lines Extension Railway, with a railway station on Station Road in the far north of the village. The former railway is now part of the Trans Pennine Trail.

==Development==
In 2009 planning permission was sought to be a marina on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal by Bells Lane. The marina proposals were rejected at appeal in 2011.

==Notable people==
*Oscar Gnosspelius, engineer.
*Ian Callaghan, former professional footballer, owned an insurance agency near the Weld Blundell.
*Bill Hartley, a British athlete, was raised in Lydiate and now runs a local floriculture business.
*Brian Labone, former professional footballer, lived in Lydiate.
*Terry Darracott, former professional footballer, lived in Lydiate.
*Gemma Merna, a British actress known as Carmel McQueen in TV soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; lives in Lydiate.

=== Notable visitors ===
* Gerard Manley Hopkins, poet and Jesuit priest, stayed in Lydiate at Rose Hill House, Pygons Hill Lane, between 1880 and 1881. Rose Hill House was the home of prominent local Catholic, Randall Lightbound and Hopkins was visiting to say Mass in the private chapel there. During his stay there he wrote the poem &quot;Spring and Fall&quot; and corresponded with poet Robert Bridges.

<doc id="972764" wikidata="Q3137650" url="?curid=972764" title="Hurricane Cesar–Douglas">
<text>Hurricane Cesar–Douglas was one of the few tropical cyclones to survive the crossover from the Atlantic to east Pacific basin, and was the last to receive a new storm name upon doing so. Hurricane Cesar was the third named storm and second hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. The system formed in the southern Caribbean Sea and affected several countries in South America before crossing Nicaragua and entering the Eastern Pacific where it was renamed Hurricane Douglas, the fourth named storm, third hurricane, and first and strongest major hurricane of the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. The storm killed 113 people in Central and South America and left 29 others missing, mainly due to flooding and mudslides.

== Meteorological history ==

The origins of Hurricane Cesar were from a tropical wave and an elongated area of low-pressure that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on July 17. For several days, the wave moved westward without any organization, although an anticyclone aloft provided conditions favorable for development. On July 22, convection, or thunderstorms, increased along the wave as it approached the southern Windward Islands. Surface pressure steadily dropped as the system moved through the Lesser Antilles, and a circulation began developing near Trinidad and Tobago. Based on surface and satellite data, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three at 18:00 UTC on July 24 near Isla Margarita, off the north coast of Venezuela. Operationally, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not consider it as a tropical depression until 18 hours later.

With an unusually strong high pressure area located over The Bahamas, the tropical depression moved westward through the southern Caribbean near the northern coast of South America. Around 1200 UTC on July 25, it struck the island of Curaçao, which reported sustained winds of . The observation indicated the depression attained tropical storm status, although operationally the depression wasn&#x27;t upgraded until the next day, at which point the NHC named the storm Cesar. After crossing Curaçao, the storm moved near or over Guajira Peninsula in extreme northern Colombia. Its proximity to South America prevented significant strengthening, until late on July 26 when the storm reached the open waters of the southwest Caribbean Sea.

On July 27, Cesar attained hurricane status about halfway between Nicaragua and Colombia. Later that day, the hurricane passed over San Andrés island. As Cesar approached Central America, a eye formed, surrounded by deep convection in the form of an eyewall. At about 0400 UTC on July 28, Hurricane Cesar made landfall just north of Bluefields, Nicaragua with winds of . It moved quickly west-northward through the country, weakening to tropical storm status and emerging into the eastern Pacific Ocean by July 29. This made Cesar the most recent tropical cyclone to traverse from the Atlantic to east Pacific basin until Hurricane Otto achieved the same feat in 2016. In addition, following the dissipation of Cesar–Douglas there was a policy change which determined that future storms would retain their original name upon crossing into another basin. Upon reaching the Pacific, the system was renamed Tropical Depression Seven-E, but in a post-analysis it was determined the cyclone remained a tropical storm status while crossing Central America. Once its status as a tropical storm was determined operationally, it was named Tropical Storm Douglas. At the time, the agreement through the World Meteorological Organization was for storms to be renamed if they crossed from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

As the storm moved westward, it quickly intensified, with an eye-like feature developing by 09:00 UTC on July 29. Shortly thereafter, Douglas attained hurricane status about southwest of the Guatemala/Mexico border. Around that time, tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated two scenarios for the future of Douglas; one was a northwest track to make landfall near Acapulco, and the other was a continued west-northwest track while remaining offshore. Hurricane Douglas ultimately took the latter track. By late on July 29, the eye of the hurricane was well-defined on Mexican radar, and with favorable upper-level outflow, warm sea surface temperatures, and a climatologically favorable region for intense hurricanes, the NHC forecast Douglas to strengthen to winds of . The next day, its structure became atypical of a strengthening hurricane, and the eye was briefly not seen on satellite imagery.

On July 31, Douglas became much better organized as it turned more west-northwestward, and it attained major hurricane status, or a Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson scale, about southwest of Manzanillo. By early on August 1, Douglas reached peak winds of , equivalent to a low end Category 4. Later that day, the hurricane attained its lowest pressure of 946 mbar, about south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. Douglas maintained peak intensity for 36 hours, until August 2 when the eye became less-organized as the overall convection began to weaken. Weakening continued due to cooler waters as Douglas turned to the west, and on August 3 the hurricane deteriorated to tropical storm status. As a tropical storm, there was minimal deep convection, although the center remained very well-defined. On August 5, Douglas weakened to tropical depression status, and by the next day could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone. The remnant circulation continued westward for several days.

==Preparations==
Prior to Cesar&#x27;s arrival in Venezuela, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas west of La Vela de Coro to the border with Colombia; the warning was discontinued later that day. The government of Colombia issued a tropical storm warning on July 25 from the border with Venezuela to Barranquilla as well as the islands of Aruba and Curaçao. These warnings were discontinued later that day after the storm&#x27;s passage.

As Cesar approached Central America, hurricane warnings were posted in Nicaragua 31 hours before landfall, leaving ample time to prepare for the hurricane. With Hurricane Joan occurring only 8 years prior, 10,724 people were evacuated before and during the hurricane to take refuge at special camps.

On July 29, shortly after Cesar emerged into the Pacific Ocean and was reclassified Tropical Depression Seven-E, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Puerto Madero to Acapulco. About 12 hours later, after the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Douglas, the Mexican government canceled the watch and issued a new tropical storm warning from Salina Cruz to Acapulco; this was due to the large extent of tropical storm force winds associated with Douglas and its proximity to the south coast of Mexico. Another tropical storm watch was briefly issued on July 30 from Acapulco to Manzanillo.

==Impact==

Hurricane Cesar was a moisture-laden tropical cyclone that dropped heavy rains along its path through the southern Caribbean Sea and Central America. Damage was moderate to extreme due to mudslides and flooding, and at least 113 people were killed.

===Lesser Antilles and South America===
The precursor tropical wave to Cesar produced rains and gusty winds through a large portion of the Lesser Antilles. In Venezuela, heavy rains from the storm triggered flooding and landslides that killed at least five people. In the capital city of Caracas, 45 people were left homeless as a result of the storm. Although the storm passed directly over the region, the ABC islands off the coast of Colombia and Venezuela received little rainfall, peaking at on Curaçao. Peak gusts were also measured at on the island. The winds caused minor damage to roofs and trees across all three islands, as well as rough surf that drowned one person in Curaçao.

As a tropical storm, Cesar struck the northern coastline of Colombia, bringing heavy rains and gusty winds. At least three people were killed in storm related incidents, two of which occurred when an avalanche buried a house in Pueblo Bello in the northern part of the country. Cesar brought torrential rains to the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina offshore eastern Nicaragua. Eleven people were killed across the archipelago, including eight children who died in a landslide. Across the islands, 60 homes lost their roofs and numerous trees were felled due to high winds. The local governor stated that losses from Cesar reached 800 million COP ($440,00 USD).

===Nicaragua===
Torrential rainfall was the immediate effect of Cesar, peaking at at Bluefields, Nicaragua with many other locations reporting over . The intense precipitation led to widespread mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country. The most affected region was Lake Managua where the water level was approaching dangerous levels. The storm wrought extensive damage throughout the country, leaving roughly $50.5 million in damage behind. Large portions of the country&#x27;s crops were affected, resulting in a food shortage following the hurricane. According to Nicaraguan officials, more than 2,500 homes, 39 bridges and of road were destroyed by Cesar. In all, the storm killed 42 people and left an estimated 100,000 homeless.

===Costa Rica===
Like Nicaragua, Costa Rica received heavy rainfall from Cesar, leading to mudslides and widespread flooding. River flooding damaged 51 houses and washed away 213 more; 72 bridges were also destroyed. The road network was significantly damaged. Costa Rica requested international aid subsequent to the storm. Across the country, at least 39 people were killed and damage amounted to $151 million. Additionally, 29 people were listed as missing.

===El Salvador===
As Cesar continued westward, it produced heavy flooding and mudslides in western El Salvador, killing 9 in the community of José Cecilio del Valle. Four others drowned in other parts of the country.

===Mexico===
Hurricane Douglas brought up to of rain on the south coast of Mexico and resulted in a storm surge. Two deaths by drowning were reported in Cabo San Lucas.

==Retirement==

The name &quot;Cesar&quot; was retired in spring of 1997, and will not be used again in the Atlantic basin. It was replaced with &quot;Cristobal&quot; in the 2002 season. As the system had little impact on land while named &quot;Douglas&quot;, that name was not retired from the Eastern Pacific rotating name lists, and so was used again.

<text>Taz-Mania is an American animated sitcom produced by Warner Bros. Animation from 1991 to 1995, broadcast in the United States on Fox Kids where it stars the Tasmanian Devil.

Similar to other Warner Bros. cartoons of its time, such as &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; (both of which were created by &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; co-developer Tom Ruegger), &quot;Taz-Mania&quot; frequently broke the fourth wall, and often made jokes showing that Taz could actually speak perfectly normally when he wanted to. The title song is performed by Jess Harnell and Jim Cummings.

==Premise==
The show follows the adventures of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Taz the Tasmanian Devil in the fictional land of Tazmania (based on Tasmania). The intro indicates that in this rendering of Tasmania &quot;the sky&#x27;s always yellow, rain or shine&quot;.

==Characters==
===Tazmanian Devil family===
* Taz Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the central character of the series and appears in every episode. Taz is the older brother of Molly and Jake. Taz is uncouth, feral, dirty, always hungry, and suffers aquaphobia, though he is less aggressive and more caring than his original incarnation. He works as a bellhop at the Hotel Tazmania.
* Jean Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Miriam Flynn) is Taz, Molly, and Jake&#x27;s loving, hard-working mother. Many episodes circle around her speaking on the phone and running through a long list of chores she has created for herself.
* Hugh Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is Taz, Molly, and Jake&#x27;s suave, friendly, and logical father, whose voice and mannerisms are a parody of Bing Crosby. Hugh likes orange juice (a reference to Crosby being a famous pitch-man for orange juice), golf, and bowling and he will often over-explain things to the point where he will say &quot;blah-blah-blah, yackity schmackity&quot;.
* Molly Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Kellie Martin) is Taz and Jake&#x27;s 16-year-old sister. Despite being more composed than her brother, she often shares his wild and aggressive nature, though in a more sibling-rivalry sense.
* Jake Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is Taz and Molly&#x27;s crazy, hyperactive, cute, and imaginative little brother, who idolizes Taz.
* Dog the Turtle (vocal effects provided by Rob Paulsen) is Taz, Molly, and Jake&#x27;s pet turtle, who acts like a dog.
* Drew Tazmanian Devil (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is Taz, Molly, and Jake&#x27;s good-humored, cool, zany, and lovable uncle who talks and acts like Bob Hope as a reference to Hugh&#x27;s parody of Bing Crosby. Like Hugh, Drew enjoys golf, bowling, telling jokes, and heading out on road trips (often forcing Taz into joining them) in spoofs of Hope and Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Road to...&quot; film series of the 1940s and 1950s.

===Hotel Tazmania staff===
* Bushwhacker Bob (voiced by Jim Cummings) is Taz&#x27;s arrogant, incompetent, intimidating, and cranky boss who is Hotel Tazmania&#x27;s hotel manager. As the owner of the Hotel Tazmania, he is a misanthropic snob, who rarely does any actual work, preferring to leave any and all tasks to his staff. His demeanor is inspired by that of Basil Fawlty, protagonist of the British sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;.
* Mum (voiced by Rosalyn Landor) is Bushwhacker Bob&#x27;s mother, who is much more patient and intelligent than her son. Despite her son being the hotel manager the Hotel Tazmania, Mum is the proprietor of the establishment. She is often quick to embarrass her son despite her comments typically being true.
* Constance Koala (voiced by Rosalyn Landor) is an enormous but gentle and humble koala who is the maid at the Hotel Tazmania. She is quite fond of singing and dancing, despite her dancing often causing unintentional destruction. She is in the same dance class that Molly takes when Taz tries ballet.
* Mr. Thickly (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is an optimistic, genial, and fun-loving wallaby whose exact job title is unspecified. He considers himself a jack-of-all-trades, always prefacing the activities he does with Taz with an exclamation that he&#x27;s &quot;an expert&quot;. He enjoys doing favors for Taz, but his ineptitude usually results in chaos.

===Outback characters===
* Digeri Dingo (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a conceited dingo. He and Taz share a mutual love for bottle cap collecting. A scavenger, treasure hunter, and chronic collector, he often takes advantage of Taz&#x27;s strength and ferocious nature to hunt rare treasures. Typically after he gets what he wants, he still berates Taz for bringing it back in a tarnished condition. His name is a play on the digeridoo. 
* Wendal T. Wolf (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a neurotic Tasmanian wolf who is desperate for any type of friendship. He resembles a shorter and recolored version of Wile E. Coyote. When not being hunted by Taz, he usually drives him crazy in his efforts to befriend him. In his first appearance, it is revealed that Wendal doesn&#x27;t taste good to Taz causing him to regurgitate Wendal. His personality closely resembles that of Woody Allen.
* Francis X. Bushlad (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a white-skinned, red-haired aboriginal boy in a diaper-shaped loincloth who unsuccessfully hunts Taz as a rite of manhood. Despite their tribal society, his entire tribe behave and speak like well-educated, posh businessmen. His name recalls silent movie star Francis X. Bushman.
* Chief Felton (voiced by Jim Cummings) is the leader of an aboriginal tribe and Francis&#x27; father who talks and acts like Jim Backus.
* Bull Gator and Axl (voiced by John Astin and Rob Paulsen respectively) are two alligators who unsuccessfully try to trap Taz for the enjoyment of zoo-going children around the world (as a rather weak pretense to the massive financial gain the endeavor will grant them). Bull is the leader of the duo, always acting in a happy and upbeat attitude even while reprimanding Axl. Axl is Bull&#x27;s hunter-in-training, constantly naïve, though often subject to Bull&#x27;s &quot;corrections&quot; (typically in the form of a mallet smashing). They vaguely resemble Laurel and Hardy.
* Buddy Boar (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a wild boar who acts like a yuppie. He is often seen talking on his mobile phone to anyone who calls him up and is best friends with Taz. Though Buddy tends to take advantage of Taz at times, he does not seem to treat him nearly as badly as Digeri Dingo, Mr. Thickley, and the Platypus Brothers do. He was established early in the show, but was seemingly ill-received, reflected in several fourth wall-breaking moments by the show&#x27;s characters. As such, Buddy&#x27;s appearances were uncommon. His later appearances suggest he was promoted to the show&#x27;s producer after he was considered to be an unliked character on the show proper and he later attempts to direct an episode featuring Bull and Axl with catastrophic results.
* Daniel and Timothy (voiced by Maurice LaMarche and Rob Paulsen) are twin platypus brothers. Timothy is the only one who wears glasses. Their love of do-it-yourself projects usually ends up causing trouble for Taz and occasionally for Buckwacker Bob when they help out at Hotel Tazmania. They closely resemble Daffy Duck in appearance and manner of speech. A pair of episodes deals with their obsession with the primetime cartoon &quot;The McKimsons&quot;, a &quot;Simpsons&quot; parody featuring a character who constantly shouts &quot;No way, I&#x27;m out of here, man!&quot;
* The Kee-Wee is a silent kiwi. It can run as fast as the Road Runner, often being chased down by Taz in search of his lunch in the same manner as Wile E. Coyote. At different points, other characters have helped Taz hunt the Kee-Wee. In its debut episode &quot;Kee-Wee Ala King&quot;, Buddy Boar helps Taz hunt the Kee-Wee due to the fact that wild boars also prey off of Kee-Wee according to a book called &quot;The Birds of Tazmania: Swimsuit Edition&quot;. In &quot;Bottle Cap Blues&quot;, Digeri Dingo helps Taz when the Kee-Wee is wearing a rare bottle cap that it is wearing. In &quot;Bird Brained Beast&quot;, the Platypus Brothers help Taz catch the Kee-Wee when they assume that he wants to keep it for a pet.
* The Bushrats are a group of bush rats in tribal costume that are led by a chief (voiced by Phil Proctor). They speak in an odd mix of real and nonsense languages that are appended by mismatched, humorous subtitles. Their favorite phrase is &quot;Spanfirkel!&quot;, which is similar to the German word &quot;Spanferkel&quot; which translates to &quot;small, young pig, which still gets suckled&quot;. On occasion, the Bushrats would run afoul of the other characters. In &quot;Of Bushrats and Hugh&quot;, the Bushrats fight Taz and Hugh over their orange harvests. In &quot;The Pied Piper of Taz-Mania&quot;, the Bushrats make their home in Hotel Tazmania causing Bushwacker Bob to order the Platypus Brothers to exterminate them.
* Willie Wombat (voiced by Phil Proctor), originally cast in a Bugs Bunny-like role against Taz, resents this typecasting and greatly admires Taz and his career. His determination to remain pacifistic and polite usually reverts to frustration and rage by the end of his episodes. Ironically, his friendly nature was previously used by Bugs in 1980&#x27;s &quot;Spaced Out Bunny&quot;.
* The Spies (variously voiced by Jim Cummings, Maurice LaMarche, and Rob Paulsen) are a group of unnamed spies with obscured faces who Taz, Hugh, and Drew run into in the &quot;Road to Tazmania&quot; episodes. As seen in two of the &quot;Road to Tazmania&quot; episodes, the Spies would go after the Tazmanian Devils when they obtain an item from a spy location&#x27;s proprietor that another spy was planning to obtain.

===&quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters===
* Bugs Bunny (voiced by Greg Burson), in &quot;A Devil of a Job&quot;, appears as a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;, driving a souped-up jeep out of a quicksand pit, saving Bushwhacker Bob and Mr. Thickley. In Willie Wombat&#x27;s debut episode &quot;Wacky Wombat, Willie phones Bugs for advice about how to handle Taz.
* Daffy Duck (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is seen riding along with Bugs in the jeep in &quot;A Devil of a Job&quot; as their souped-up jeep emerges from the quicksand pit. He tells him &quot;I told you this was the left at Albuquerque&quot;.
* Yosemite Sam (voiced by Maurice LaMarche), after Willie phones Bugs for advice, is called by Taz in &quot;Wacky Wombat&quot;. He is never actually seen and expresses surprise that Taz has his own show by asking &quot;Ain&#x27;t you retired yet?&quot;
* Sam Sheepdog (voiced by Jim Cummings), in one episode, was working as a sheepdog. Taz, working as a temporary agent for carnivorous predators, substitutes for Ralph Wolf and attempts to steal sheep from Sam&#x27;s pen (a bit of character confusion was at play here, as at one point Sam suggests &quot;I thought I was a bit too hard on that coyote last week&quot;).
* Foghorn Leghorn (voiced by Greg Burson), because of his name, was mistaken for hotel critic F.H. Leghorn by Bushwhacker Bob in &quot;Gone with the Windbag&quot;.
* Beaky Buzzard makes a cameo in the show where he&#x27;s seen relaxing on his nest.
* Marvin the Martian (voiced by Rob Paulsen) once comes to Earth on vacation in &quot;The Man from M.A.R.S.&quot;, glad his plans to destroy it failed. His attempts at relaxation are thwarted by Taz&#x27;s noisy behavior, cajoling him into wanting to destroy Earth again, and his actions indeed cause Earth to explode due to a temporal anomaly.
* Road Runner makes a cameo appearance in the show and is caught by Taz. Taz is then about to eat him, but lets the bird go after Axl and Bull try to kidnap Taz.
* Wile E. Coyote makes a cameo appearance in the show when he&#x27;s being seen at the Boulder Museum.

<doc id="972774" wikidata="Q44082" url="?curid=972774" title="Echternach Gospels">
<text>The Echternach Gospels (Paris, Bib. N., MS. lat. 9389) were produced, presumably, at Lindisfarne Abbey in Northumbria around the year 690. This location was very significant for the production of Insular manuscripts, such as the Durham Gospels (ms. A.II.17) and the Lindisfarne Gospels (ms. Cotton Nero D. IV). The scribe of the Durham Gospels is believed to have created the Echternach Gospels as well. The Echternach Gospels are now in the collection of France&#x27;s Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.

This manuscript, and other such Hiberno-Saxon codices, were highly important instructional devices used in the Early Middle Ages primarily for conversion. The Echternach Gospels were probably taken by Willibrord, a Northumbrian missionary, to his newly founded Abbey of Echternach, now in Luxembourg, from which they are named. It is significant that this early Hiberno-Saxon manuscript should have been brought here because, with Willibrord as Abbot, the scriptoria at Echternach would then become the most influential centre for Hiberno-Saxon style manuscript production in continental Europe.

==Production==
Early medieval manuscripts were produced in monastic scriptoria by scribes and artists. These manuscripts were made of parchment or vellum, stretched calfskin, that was then cut to size at the monastery. Next, a scribe would copy the words of the text before an artist would illuminate, or paint, them. The folios, or pages, would be bound after all the art was completed. Multiple scribes and artists would work on a single manuscript. The primary artist that worked on the Echternach Gospels is believed to be the same master who created the Durham Gospels at Lindisfarne. This assumption is credible due to the similarities in the style of the art and the close date of production.

The styles of the Durham and Echternach Gospels belong to the Hiberno-Saxon style of early medieval Britain. This style is classified by intricate interlacing or linear patterns, flat geometric layout, and reduced schematic figures. The Evangelist portraits that precede each of the books in the Echternach Gospels depict the symbols of the Evangelists in a very flat representation surrounded by geometric patterns. The tradition of portraying each author&#x27;s portrait comes from the late antique Roman style of manuscript illumination. As the Christian Church spreads across Europe, a resurgence of Imperial Roman conventions in art is evidenced as early as the 6th century through the Carolingian period. The Hiberno-Saxon artistic style, however, did not have a precedent for the naturalized figural representation growing in popularity. The very flat and stylized figural representation that we see in the Echternach Gospels are a result of the integration of the Roman author portrait convention depicted in the native visual language which emphasizes abstraction.

==Function==
The Echternach Gospels were probably taken by Willibrord when he founded the Abbey of Echternach in the year 698. Willibrord, like many early medieval missionaries, travelled through Europe and used manuscripts to convert locals to Christianity. The Echternach Gospels are an example of illuminated manuscripts that served as teaching tools as well as liturgical books. It is argued that the bright colours and abstract designs of Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts, in particular, captured the mysticism of Christianity for non-Christians. Because these converts were illiterate the images were hugely significant for their understanding of what was taught. Bede, the eighth-century Northumbrian monk, writes that religious imagery was for the “intent that all who entered the church, even if ignorant of letters, might be able to contemplate … the ever-gracious countenance of Christ and his saints&quot;. The decoration of the text itself portrayed for the illiterate converts the mysticism and glory of the literal “Word of God.”

The importance of such manuscripts for medieval missionary work is evident in the work of the early British monks. For example, in the sixth century Columbanus founded many monasteries in Europe with an emphasis on manuscript production. Augustine, sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 597, travelled to England as a missionary for King Æthelberht of Kent, bringing many of his manuscripts with him as necessary conversion tools. The introduction of these and other such imported Roman codices influenced the Insular manuscripts such as the Echternach Gospels a century later.

==Context==
The Synod of Whitby at Wearmouth-Jarrow was a significant Church ruling that affected the production of Insular manuscripts. The council was initially called to reconcile a dispute over the date of Easter and address other dissenting issues between Eastern and Western Christianity. Culminating with the ruling by King Oswy in 664, The Synod of Whitby stated an official preference of the Roman Christianity. Though this conclusion rejected Insular doctrine, the Hiberno-Saxon style script of manuscripts, however, was maintained and preferred throughout Europe. The result of this conflation of Eastern and Western Christianity is evident in the growing inclusion of Roman Style author portraits and Insular carpet pages while the text began to favour Roman capitals in Germanic runic-style script. These collaborative manuscripts which incorporate Roman conventions are depicted in the European tribal styles. This developing framework of medieval Christianity contextualizes many of these Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts, including the Echternach Gospels, under the canvas of the multicultural Roman Church.

==History and Relocation==
The Echternach Gospels were removed from the abbey 1802 when it was secularized after the French Revolution.

<text>Hayuya (born c. 1470s) was the Taíno Cacique (Chief) who governed the area in Puerto Rico which now bears his name (which is now spelled &quot;Jayuya&quot;).

==Arrival of the Conquistadors==
When the Spaniards arrived in &quot;Borikén&quot; (the Taíno name for Puerto Rico), they were greeted with open arms by the Taínos, who lived a peaceful and organized life. This made it easy for Juan Ponce de León and his men to conquer the island. Before the Spaniards arrived, the Taínos had a form of government where each region had a tribe headed by a Cacique. Some of the Caciques, like Hayuya, were more powerful than others. They all, however, responded to the &quot;Supreme Cacique&quot;, which at that time was Agueybana. The area that Hayuya dominated is considered to be the &quot;birth place&quot; of the Taíno culture in the island.

However, the Spaniards soon started to enslave the natives. On February 1511, Agueybana&#x27;s brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and Urayoan (The Añasco Cacique), and their men drowned Diego Salcedo. They watched Salcedo&#x27;s body to see whether he would resuscitate: when he didn&#x27;t, the Taínos realized that the Spaniards were not gods and thus, the Taínos became rebellious.

==Chronicles of the Indias==
According to the &quot;Chronicles of the Indias&quot; which are found in Seville, Spain, Hayuya lived and governed the area which is now named after him, in the interior central part of Puerto Rico. On September 7, 1513, Juan Ponce de León, who was appointed governor by the &quot;Spanish Crown&quot;, sent troops headed by Alonso Niño and Alonso de Mendoza to quash the rebellious Taínos. When they arrived at Hayuya&#x27;s village, they proceeded to raid and murder its inhabitants. They burned the village to the ground. The Taínos that survived were taken as prisoners and some were made to work the mines as slaves. The others were sent to Spain where they were sold as slaves for 145 &quot;pesos&quot;. Eventually, the Taínos died from working in the mines or from the smallpox epidemic.

==Legacy==
The &quot;National Indigenous Festival&quot; (Festival Nacional Indígena) which honors the memory of Hayuya and the Taíno heritage is celebrated annually on November 24 in the town of Jayuya. There is a monument of Hayuya, the only one of its kind to be dedicated to a Taíno Cacique, located in Jayuya&#x27;s Cultural Center next to a Taíno tomb. It was sculpted by Puerto Rican artist Tomás Batista in 1969. Hayuya is also represented in the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

<doc id="972776" wikidata="Q3849484" url="?curid=972776" title="Stefan Starzyński">
<text>Stefan Bronisław Starzyński (19 August 1893 – between 21 and 23 December 1939) was a Polish statesman, economist, military officer and Mayor of Warsaw before and during the Siege of 1939.

==Early life, studies and career==
Stefan Bronisław Starzyński was born on 19 August 1893 in Warsaw. He participated in the 1905 school strike. After graduating from a &quot;gymnasium&quot;, he enrolled in the Department of Economics at the Higher School of Trade (&quot;Wyższe Kursy Handlowe&quot;), a private-run university, now Warsaw School of Economics. In 1909 he also joined various patriotic organizations, including the Riflemen&#x27;s Association (&quot;Związek Strzelecki&quot;).

In August 1914, after the outbreak of the Great War, he joined Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions and became an ordinary soldier in the 1st Brigade. He took part in all battles and skirmishes of his Brigade and was quickly promoted to officer. After the &quot;Pledge Crisis&quot; in 1917 he was arrested and, together with most of his colleagues, interned in Beniaminów. In November 1918 he joined the Polish Army and became the Chief of Staff of the 9th Polish Infantry Division. During the Polish-Bolshevik War he was transferred to the 2nd Department of the General Staff, which carried out mostly intelligence tasks.

After demobilization he remained in public service. He supervised one of the repatriation commissions in Moscow and later one of the departments of the Ministry of Treasury. In the years 1929–30 and 1931–32 he was a deputy minister of the treasury. In 1930 he became a member of Polish Sejm for a three years period as a member of the Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (BBWR). He was also a deputy president of Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego, one of the largest Polish banks.

During his life he published several academic papers on the economy.

==Mayor of Warsaw==

In the early 1930s Warsaw had a huge hole in its budget. The city&#x27;s development had been halted by a lack of funds while the population continued to grow rapidly. On 1 August 1934, Starzyński was chosen by the Sanacja régime to become the president of Warsaw, and was given special powers. Local authorities were disbanded and Starzyński became responsible only to central government.

At first Starzyński was viewed by the majority of Varsovians as yet another Sanacja stooge imposed on a city that mostly supported the opposition. But he soon gained popularity, even among his former enemies. He initiated a plan for fast-track reform of the financial system. The money saved thanks to these reforms was reinvested in public works that reduced unemployment. He managed to electrify the suburbs of Wola and Grochów, pave all the major roads out of Warsaw, and to connect the city centre with the newly built northern district of Żoliborz through a bridge over the northern railway line. These actions earned him the nickname &quot;president of the suburbs&quot;.

He became popular among the inhabitants of the borough of Śródmieście (City Centre) for his action of planting trees and flowers along the main streets. Starzyński also ordered the creation of a huge park in Wola and several minor green areas in other parts of the city. During his presidency Warsaw was also enlarged to the south. The area of former airfield on Pole Mokotowskie in the borough of Mokotów was cut in two parts by Aleje Niepodległości (&quot;Avenue of Independence&quot;), nowadays one of the main streets of Warsaw. Among the most important facilities opened during his presidency were the National Museum, new building of the city library, new building of his alma mater, now renamed to Warsaw School of Economics and the &quot;Powszechny&quot; theatre, which became one of the most influential scenes of Warsaw. Other initiatives of Starzyński include complete reconstruction of boulevards along the Vistula and partial reconstruction of the barbican in the Old Town area.

In 1934 he was chosen as a president of Warsaw for a four-year term. On 18 December 1938 he was elected in democratic elections for his second term. Starzyński held his office until World War II broke out. During his presidency:
* 2,000,000 km² of paved roads were built
* 44 schools were opened
* National Museum was built
* 2 major parks were opened to the public (one of them is now a National Reserve)
* construction of Warsaw Metro started

==World War II==

After the start of Polish Defensive War of 1939 Starzyński, refused to leave Warsaw together with other state authorities and diplomats on 4 September 1939. Instead he joined the army as a major of infantry. The Minister of War shortly before his departure created the Command of the Defense of the Capital with general Walerian Czuma as its commander. On 7 September the forces of 4th German Panzer Division managed to break the Polish lines near Częstochowa and started their march towards Warsaw. Most of the city authorities were evacuated to the east. Warsaw was left with a military garrison composed mainly of infantry battalions and batteries of artillery. The Headquarters of general Czuma had to organize the defense of the city. Unfortunately, there was some misunderstanding among the command. At that time Poland still believed that any time soon Great Britain and France would attack Germany according to the treaties which were signed by these countries at the beginning of 1939. As it happened these obligations were never to materialise. However, at that stage the Polish authorities wanted to preserve younger reservists for future fighting, so the spokesman of the garrison of Warsaw issued a communique in which he ordered all young men to leave the city. That step weakened the strength of the defence garrison.

To counter the mess that started in Warsaw, general Czuma appointed Stefan Starzyński as the Civilian Commissar of Warsaw. Starzyński started to organize the &quot;Civil Guard&quot; to replace the evacuated police forces. He also ordered all members of the city&#x27;s administration to retake their posts. In his daily radio releases he asked all civilians to construct barricades and anti-tank barriers at the outskirts of Warsaw. According to many sources from the epoch his daily speeches were a crucial factor in keeping the morale of both the soldiers and the civilians high during the Siege of Warsaw. Starzyński commanded the distribution of food, water and supplies as well as fire fighting brigades. He also managed to organise shelter for almost all civilian refugees from other parts of Poland and houses destroyed by German aerial bombardment. Before the Siege ended he became the symbol of the defence of Warsaw in 1939.

On 27 September the commanders of the besieging German forces demanded that Starzyński be present during the signing of the capitulation of Warsaw. Before the capitulation he was offered to leave the city several times. The pilot of the prototype PZL.46 Sum plane that managed to escape from internment in Romania and landed safely in besieged Warsaw offered himself to evacuate Starzyński to Lithuania. He was also proposed to go underground and receive plastic surgery in order to escape the city. He refused.

After the Germans entered the city on 28 September 1939, Starzyński was allowed to continue his service as the president of Warsaw. He was active in organisation of life in the occupied city as well as its reconstruction after the German terror bombing campaign. At the same time he became one of the organizers of Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, the first underground organisation in occupied Poland that eventually became the Armia Krajowa. Among other things he provided it with thousands of clean forms of ID cards, birth registry forms and passports. Those documents were later used in validation of false identities of many members of the resistance.

==Arrest and death==

On 5 October he was arrested by the Gestapo and, together with several other prominent inhabitants of Warsaw, held hostage as a warrant of safety for Adolf Hitler during a parade of victory held in Warsaw. The following day all of them were released. On 27 October 1939 he was again arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned in the Pawiak prison. In December he was yet again offered to escape, but he again refused claiming that it would be too costly to those involved in his escape.

His fate remained unknown until, on 8 September 2014, the Polish IPN-Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej) officially closed the investigation of the circumstances of his death. Based on a recent eyewitness testimony, the IPN&#x27;s commission of inquiry came to the conclusion that Stefan Starzyński was shot by the Gestapo at some point between 21 and 23 December 1939. in Warsaw or its surroundings. The crime was committed by Gestapo functionaries Oberscharführer Hermann Schimmann, Hauptscharführer Weber, and Unterscharführer Perlbach. However, it has not been possible to unambiguously establish the Gestapo functionaries who had given the order to kill Stefan Starzyński.

According to an earlier version of the account, which has been discarded by the IPN, it was believed that Starzyński had been transferred to Moabit prison in Berlin and then to Dachau concentration camp, where he was thought to have died. Several other accounts had assumed that he was either transferred to a potash mine in Baelberge or that he was held hostage in Warsaw until the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising. The date of his death was assumed to be 17 October 1943 (shot dead in the Dachau concentration camp), although other versions mentioned August 1944 (Warsaw), 1944 (Baelberge), 1943 (Spandau prison) or January 1940 (Dachau).

One version of the account was based on documents, which the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) had received from Germany in 2008. The documents had been held in the archives of former East German Ministry of State Security (&quot;Stasi&quot;), and they claimed that Starzyński was tortured and died on 19 March 1944 in a potassium salt mine, where he was allegedly held captive at a prisoner of subsidiaries camp and slave-worked in Leipzig Enterprise Transport, which produced aircraft parts. According to witnesses, he was allegedly placed on the board set on trestles, holding 2 full buckets of water, under the &quot;penalty&quot; of being shot if he would drop them. According to this account, Starzyński stood on it until he collapsed and died of exhaustion. This version of the circumstances of Starzyński&#x27;s death was also discarded by the IPN in September 2014.

In 1957, a memorial was erected to his memory in the Powązki cemetery in Warsaw.

==Legacy and remembrance==

After the war the rebuilt &quot;Warszawa II&quot; radio station was named after him. Currently there are several monuments to Starzyński in Warsaw as well as a street and several schools named after him. His September 1939 radio broadcasts are now considered to be a part of popular culture in Poland. Starzyński&#x27;s quiet, hoarsened voice and the texts of his speeches are nowadays easily recognizable by most Varsovians. In 2003 the readers of news papers and the spectators of the Warsaw branch of the public television elected Starzyński as &quot;the Varsovian of the Century&quot; by a huge majority of votes.

In 1978 his popularized story was filmed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki in his movie &quot;Gdziekolwiek jesteś, panie prezydencie&quot; (&quot;Wherever You Are, Mr. President&quot;).

<doc id="972779" wikidata="Q7435526" url="?curid=972779" title="Scotch Piper Inn">
<text>The Scotch Piper Inn in Lydiate, North West, England is the oldest pub in the historic county of Lancashire. The building dates from 1320 and is a Grade II* listed building.

It is located on the A5147, from Liverpool and from Southport in the ceremonial county of Merseyside. It stands close to the site of Lydiate Hall and next to the remains of St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel.

==History==

The fabric of the building is thought to date from 1320, but most of the current building is probably from the 16th century. It was originally known as &quot;The Royal Oak&quot;. According to local legends it was renamed &quot;the Scotch Piper&quot; in honour of an injured Scottish piper connected with the Jacobite Rebellion in the 18th century, who visited the inn.

The Moorcroft family were the landlords from the 1880s until 1945. Tony Blair once visited the Scotch Piper, in 1999 during his first term as prime minister.

The Admiral Taverns pub suffered severe fire damage to its thatched roof on Tuesday 6 December 2016. The main structure of the roof and fabric of the building were saved. The pub re-opened in April 2017.

==Events==
The Scotch Piper Classics is a popular car meet held at the pub every Monday evening and every third Sunday of the month. There is also a bike meet every Wednesday.

==Architecture==

The two-storey cruck framed whitewashed brick building retains a thatched roof. It is in three bays. The left two bays are in a single storey, and contain at least two cruck trusses; it was encased in brick in the 17th century. The right bay was rebuilt in the 18th century, using fabric from Lydiate Hall, and is in storeys. On the front are four buttresses, and the windows are horizontally-sliding sashes, with a gabled dormer.

<text>Porterbrook is a British rolling stock company (ROSCO), created as part of the privatisation of British Rail. Together with Angel Trains and Eversholt Rail Group, it is one of the three original ROSCOs.

Porterbrook was established in March 1994 and was privatised via a management buyout during November 1995. In August 1997, it was acquired by the transport specialist Stagecoach at a far higher value. Two and a half years later, Stagecoach sold Porterbrook to the British banking group Abbey National. Prior to this, Porterbrook had entered the freight leasing market for the first time as well as the continental European rail leasing market; the latter activities were sold off in December 2004, resulting in the creation of CB Rail. On 27 October 2008, Porterbrook was purchased from Abbey National by a consortium of Antin Infrastructure Partners, Deutsche Bank and Lloyds TSB.

During the 2010s, Porterbrook engaged in various projects to overhaul or dispose of aging rolling stock. Some of its Class 319 electric multiple units were rebuilt as Class 769 bi-mode units to work on both electrified and non-electrified routes. In 2020, Porterbrook started a £55 million five-year programme to refurbish 214 Class 377 &#x27;Electrostar&#x27; EMUs operated by Southern. Furthermore, many of its Class 43 power cars, historically operated as a part of the Intercity 125, were sold or donated to other parties, along with its fleet of Class 90 electric locomotives.

==History==

Porterbrook was established on 21 March 1994 as a subsidiary of British Rail in preparation for the privatisation of British Rail. It was named after the Porter Brook, a river that passed by British Rail&#x27;s Sheffield offices (Specifically Sheaf House, adjacent to Sheffield railway station, which was demolished in late 2005 as part of a city centre regeneration project). In November 1995, Porterbrook was privatised via a management buyout.

In 1996, Porterbrook entered the freight leasing market though a deal to purchase and lease back 70 locomotives and 699 wagons from Freightliner. On 28 August 1996, the company was purchased by the transport conglomerate Stagecoach in exchange for £825 million; this deal was subject to considerable criticism for the low value returned to the taxpayer. On 20 April 2000, Stagecoach opted to sell Porterbrook to the British banking group Abbey National for a reported £1.44 billion.

Porterbrook established its own subsidiary to handle its European rail leasing activities; this was sold to a joint venture between Babcock &amp; Brown and Bank of Scotland Corporate Europe during December 2004, creating CB Rail. At the time of the takeover, the subsidiary had leasing arrangements for 28 locomotives and 67 coaches.

On 27 October 2008, the business was purchased from Abbey National by a consortium of Antin Infrastructure Partners, Deutsche Bank and Lloyds TSB. The sale, which reportedly valued Porterbrook and its 6,014-strong rolling stock inventory at £2 billion, gave rise to concerns that Abbey National, and its Spanish parent Banco Santander, were subject to considerable financial stress at that time.

During the 2010s, Porterbrook engaged in various efforts to overhaul and refurbish elements of its rolling stock, particularly multiple units. One proposal was the refurbishment of its British Rail Class 144 &#x27;Pacer&#x27; diesel multiple units, referred to as the &quot;Class 144e (Evolution)&quot;, it would bring it up to the requirements of the Persons with reduced mobility-Technical Specifications for Interoperability accessibility regulations. It featured several upgrades such as the addition of new 2+2 style seating, a fully accessible toilet, two wheelchair spaces and spaces for bicycles and luggage, as well as Wi-Fi and media screens.

In December 2016, Arriva UK Trains subsidiary Northern and Porterbrook announced a plan to convert eight Class 319 electric multiple units to bi-mode units, to allow through working between electrified and non-electrified routes. These units, which were initially marketed as &quot;Class 319 Flex&quot;, have been designated as Class 769 under TOPS, will use newly-installed diesel engines alternators fitted under each of the driving trailer vehicles, to power the traction motors through the train&#x27;s existing DC bus.

During the 2010s, Porterbrook begun disposing of their Class 43 power cars, used on Intercity 125 services; a number of power cars (along with a set of Mark 3 coaches) were acquired by Locomotive Services Limited, while the two locomotives involved in the record breaking test run were donated, one, 43102, to the national collection at Shildon, and the other, 43159, to the 125 Group.

During 2019, Freightliner purchased 13 Class 90 electric locomotives from Porterbrook that were formerly operated by Greater Anglia. Upon their transfer in May 2020, they underwent a modification programme to match the freight Class 90 specification. In February 2020, Porterbrook signed a 15-year lease with St Modwen to take over the &quot;Quinton Rail Technology Centre&quot; at Long Marston.

In 2020, it was announced that Porterbrook was funding a £55 million five-year Project Aurora programme to refurbish 214 Class 377 &#x27;Electrostar&#x27; EMUs operated by Southern Trains. Changes include the installation of screens showing live GTR and London Underground service information, the provision of USB and power points, energy-saving LED lighting and a passenger-counting system which will enable GTR to analyse how busy individual services are.

During July 2021, an agreement was announced for the British investment fund Dalmore Capital and an Israeli infrastructure fund, Generation Capital, to acquire the 30% shareholding in Porterbook previously held by The Infrastructure Fund, Utilities Trust of Australia and the NatWest pension fund.

==Porterbrook liveried locomotives==

Porterbrook has painted some locomotives in its purple house colours. &quot;Deltic&quot; D9016 was repainted in 1999 after Porterbrook sponsored its return to service. Class 47s 47807 and 47817 operated for Virgin CrossCountry in the late 1990s in Porterbrook livery as did 57601 for First Great Western from 2001, and 87002 for Virgin Trains West Coast from 2003.

==Initial fleet==
The fleet Porterbrook inherited from British Rail in 1994 comprised:

<text>Military aviation comprises military aircraft and other flying machines for the purposes of conducting or enabling aerial warfare, including national airlift (air cargo) capacity to provide logistical supply to forces stationed in a war theater or along a front. Airpower includes the national means of conducting such warfare, including the intersection of transport and warcraft. Military aircraft include bombers, fighters, transports, trainer aircraft, and reconnaissance aircraft.

==History==


The first military uses of aviation involved lighter-than-air balloons. During the Battle of Fleurus in 1794, the French observation balloon &quot;l&#x27;Entreprenant&quot; was used to monitor Austrian troop movements. The use of lighter-than-air aircraft in warfare became prevalent in the 19th century, including regular use in the American Civil War. Lighter-than-air military aviation persisted until shortly after World War II, gradually being withdrawn from various roles as heavier-than-air aircraft improved.

Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on, despite resistance from traditionalists and the severe limitations of early aircraft. The U.S. Army Signal Corps purchased a Wright Model A on 2 August 1909 which became the first military aircraft in history. In 1911, the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photo-reconnaissance, and bombing roles during the Italo-Turkish War. On October 23, 1911, an Italian pilot, Captain Carlo Piazza, flew over Turkish lines on the world&#x27;s first aerial reconnaissance mission, and on November 1, the first ever aerial bomb was dropped by &quot;Sottotenente&quot; Giulio Gavotti, on Turkish troops in Libya, from an early model of Etrich Taube aircraft. The Turks, lacking anti-aircraft weapons, were the first to shoot down an airplane by rifle fire.

The earliest military role filled by aircraft was reconnaissance, however, by the end of World War I, military aviation had rapidly embraced many specialized roles, such as artillery spotting, air superiority, bombing, ground attack, and anti-submarine patrols. Technological improvements were made at a frenzied pace, and the first all-metal cantilevered airplanes were going into service as the war ended.

Between the major world wars incremental improvements made in many areas, especially powerplants, aerodynamics, structures, and weapons, led to an even more rapid advance in aircraft technology during World War II, with large performance increases and the introduction of aircraft into new roles, including Airborne Early Warning, electronic warfare, weather reconnaissance, and flying lifeboats. Great Britain used aircraft to suppress revolts throughout the Empire during the interwar period and introduced the first military transports, which revolutionized logistics, allowing troops and supplies to be quickly delivered over vastly greater distances. 
While they first appeared during World War I, ground attack aircraft didn&#x27;t provide a decisive contribution until the Germans introduced Blitzkrieg during the Invasion of Poland and Battle of France, where aircraft functioned as mobile flying artillery to quickly disrupt defensive formations. The Allies would later use rocket-equipped fighters in the same role, immobilizing German armored divisions during the Battle of Normandy and afterwards. 
World War I also saw the creation of the first strategic bomber units, however, they wouldn&#x27;t be tested until the Spanish Civil War where the perceived effects of mass bombardment would encourage their widespread use during World War II. Carrier aviation also first appeared during World War I, and likewise came to play a major role during World War II, with most major navies recognizing the aircraft carrier&#x27;s advantages over the battleship and devoting massive resources to the building of new carriers.

During World War II, U-boats threatened the ability of the Allies to transport troops and war materiel to Europe, spurring the development of very long range Maritime patrol aircraft, whose capability of independently detecting and destroying submerged submarines was greatly increased with new detection systems, including sonobuoys, Leigh Lights, and radar, along with better weapons including homing torpedoes and improved depth charges. This played a major role in winning the Battle of the Atlantic. Aircraft also played a much expanded role, with many notable engagements being decided solely through the use of military aircraft, such as the Battle of Britain or the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the conclusion of the Pacific War against Japan was marked by two lone aircraft dropping the atomic bombs, devastating the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The introduction of the jet engine, radar, early missiles, helicopters, and computers are World War II advancements which are felt to the present day.

Post World War II, the development of military aviation was spurred by the Cold War stand-off between the super-powers. The helicopter appeared late in World War II and matured into an indispensable part of military aviation, transporting troops and providing expanded anti-submarine capabilities to smaller warships, negating the need for large numbers of small carriers. The need to out-perform opponents pushed new technology and aircraft developments in the U.S.S.R. and the United States, among others, and the Korean War and the Vietnam War tested the resulting designs. Incredible advances in electronics were made, starting with the first electronic computers during World War II and steadily expanding from its original role of cryptography into communications, data processing, reconnaissance, remotely piloted aircraft, and many other roles until it has become an integral aspect of modern warfare.
In the early 1960s, missiles were expected to replace manned interceptors and the guns in other manned aircraft. They failed to live up to expectations as surface-to-air missiles lacked flexibility and were not as effective as manned interceptors, and fighters equipped only with air-to-air missiles had limited effectiveness against opposing aircraft which could avoid being hit. Missiles were also expensive, especially against low-value ground targets. The 1970s saw the return of the gun-armed fighter, and a greater emphasis on maneuverability. The 1980s through to the present day were characterized by stealth technology and other countermeasures.

Today, a country&#x27;s military aviation forces are often the first line of defense against an attack, or the first forces to attack the enemy, and effective military aviation forces (or lack thereof) have proved decisive in several recent conflicts such as the Gulf War.

Airborne Early Warning provides advance warning of enemy activities to reduce the chance of being surprised. Many also have command functions that allow them to direct or vector friendly fighters onto incoming bogeys.

Bombers are capable of carrying large payloads of bombs and may sacrifice speed or maneuverability to maximize payload.

Experimental aircraft are designed to test advanced aerodynamic, structural, avionic, or propulsion concepts. These are usually well instrumented, with performance data telemetered on radio-frequency data links to ground stations located at the test ranges where they are flown.

Fighters establish and maintain air superiority. Speed and maneuverability are usually requirements and they carry a variety of weapons, including machine guns and guided missiles, to do this.

Forward Air Control directs close air support aircraft to ensure that the intended targets are nullified and friendly troops remain uninjured.

Ground-attack aircraft support ground troops by weakening or nullifying enemy defenses. Helicopter gunships and specialized ground attack aircraft attack enemy armor or troops and provide close air support for ground troops.

Liaison aircraft are usually small, unarmed aircraft used to deliver messages and key personnel.

Maritime Patrol Aircraft are used to control sea-lanes, and are often equipped with special electronic gear for detecting and sinking submarines, such as sonar. They are also used for search and rescue missions and fisheries patrols.

Multirole combat aircraft combine the capabilities of both a fighter or a bomber, depending on what the mission calls for.

Reconnaissance aircraft and scout helicopters are primarily used to gather intelligence. They are equipped with photographic, infrared, radar, and television sensors. This role is increasingly being filled by spy satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.

Refueling aircraft are used to refuel fighters and reconnaissance aircraft, extending mission reach and flying range. These aircraft include but are not limited to the KC-135, KC-46, KC-767, A310 MRTT, and the KC-130J. These aircraft are a part of many countries&#x27; militant assets.

Training aircraft are used to train recruits to fly aircraft and to provide additional training for specialized roles such as in air combat.

Transport aircraft transport troops and supplies. Cargo can be on pallets for quick unloading. Cargo, and personnel may also be discharged from flying aircraft on parachutes. Also included in this category are aerial tankers, which can refuel other aircraft while in flight. Helicopters and gliders can transport troops and supplies to areas where other aircraft would be unable to land.

==Air forces==
An air force is the branch of a nation&#x27;s armed forces that is responsible for aerial warfare as distinct from the army, navy, or other branches. Most nations either maintain an air force or, in the case of smaller and less well-developed countries, an air wing (see List of air forces). Air forces are usually tasked with the air defense of a country, as well as strategic bombing, interdiction, close air support, intelligence gathering, battlespace management, transport functions, and providing services to civil government agencies. Air force operations may also include space-based operations such as reconnaissance or satellite operations.

==Other branches==
Other branches of a nation&#x27;s armed forces may use aviation (naval aviation and army aviation), in addition to or instead of, a dedicated air force. In some cases, this includes coast guard services that are also an armed service, as well as gendarmeries and equivalent forces.

<text>Bleiburg () is a small town in the south Austrian state of Carinthia (&quot;Koroška&quot;), south-east of Klagenfurt, in the district of Völkermarkt, some four kilometres (2.5 miles) from the border with Slovenia.

The municipality consists of the twelve &quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot; Aich (&quot;Dob&quot;), Bleiburg, Grablach (&quot;Grablje&quot;), Kömmel (&quot;Komelj&quot;), Moos (&quot;Blato&quot;), Oberloibach (&quot;Libuče&quot;), Rinkenberg (&quot;Vogrče&quot;), Sankt Margarethen (&quot;Šmarjeta&quot;), Schattenberg (&quot;Senčni kraj&quot;), Unterloibach (&quot;Libuče&quot;), Weißenstein (&quot;Belšak&quot;) and Woroujach (&quot;Borovje&quot;). According to a 2001 census, 30.4% of the population are Carinthian Slovenes (in 1971, they were 52.8%). 

==Geography==
The border town is located in the valley of the Feistritz creek, a right tributary of the Drava, north of the Peca massif of the Karawanks mountain range. It is home to a district court, military barracks and to the local productive and services industry. The name of Bleiburg, literally meaning &#x27;Lead Castle&#x27;, can be attributed to the lead mining operations in the Peca mountain.

==History==

The area was part of the &quot;Liupicdorf&quot; estate in the Duchy of Carinthia, which about 1000 Bishop Albuin I of Brixen dedicated to his brother Count Aribo. The oldest surviving document mentioning the town as &quot;castrum et forum Pliburch&quot; is dated to 1228. The comital estates of Bleiburg Castle were seized by the Habsburg dukes Albert III and Leopold III in 1369, the settlement received town privileges the next year. On 16 March 1393 Duke Albert granted the citizens the right to hold the annual &quot;Wiesenmarkt&quot; (&#x27;meadow market&#x27;) fair, which has taken place on 1 September every year up to today at least since 1428. In 1601 the castle was ceded to the Thurn-Valsassina comital family, who had it rebuilt in its present Renaissance style and still owns it today, together with the nearby Castle Hagenegg in Eisenkappel-Vellach.

Between 1918 and 1920, Bleiburg was occupied by Yugoslav troops. In spite of the overwhelming Slovene majority in the area, the town remained in Austria after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire along national/ethnic lines after the end of World War I. In the Carinthian Plebiscite of 1920, in fact, the inhabitants of southern Carinthia rejected the proposal to unite with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (the later Yugoslavia), and chose to remain in Austria. In the constituency of Bleiburg, however, a slim majority of the population (51%) cast its vote for Yugoslavia. In the territory of the present-day municipality of Bleiburg, 59.8% of the voters chose Yugoslavia over Austria.

===Bleiburg repatriations===

On 15 May 1945, the Independent State of Croatia capitulated to the victorious Yugoslav Army in Bleiburg. It was the initial location of a series of extrajudicial executions, in the course of which Partisans killed thousands of Croatian Home Guard and Ustaše, Slovene Home Guard and Serbian Chetnik troops, who had surrendered to the British forces in Allied-occupied Austria and been repatriated in Operation Keelhaul.

===Town sign controversy===

Bleiburg/Pliberk became famous in Austrian and Slovenian media in the years 2005 and 2007, due to a long controversy over the erection of a bilingual place name. The controversy was part of a decade-long Carinthian &quot;place sign struggle&quot; (&quot;Ortstafelstreit&quot;, ) between representatives of the Carinthian Slovenes and right-wing politicians of the German-speaking mainstream society.

In December 2005, the Constitutional Court of Austria ruled that the topographic sign at the entrance to the town of Bleiburg was unconstitutional, since it was written only in German, and ordered the erection of a bilingual, German-Slovene sign. In February 2006, the Carinthian governor Jörg Haider made a great stir by personally moving the German sign for a few meters, hoping to create a new legal situation that would require a new decision of the Constitutional Court.

However, already in March 2006, the district commissioner of Völkermarkt issued an official ordinance, enforcing the erection of a bilingual sign in accordance to the decision of the Court. Nevertheless Governor Jörg Haider refused to carry out the ordinance, further fanning the controversy&#x27;s flames. In August of the same year, Haider personally added a small plaque with the Slovene name of the town (&quot;Pliberk&quot;) under the German one. In December 2006, the Austrian Constitutional Court declared such action illegal, reiterating its decision that proper bilingual signs should be erected.

In February 2007, the Carinthian Regional Prosecution started a legal procedure against Governor Haider and his deputy Gerhard Dörfler for official misconduct in the case of the Bleiburg place sign. Investigations were scrapped after the governor had died in a traffic accident on 11 October 2008. Upon another verdict by the Constitutional Court on 9 July 2010, proper bilingual signs were finally erected at the behest of Haider&#x27;s successor Gerhard Dörfler.

<doc id="972800" wikidata="Q570554" url="?curid=972800" title="Abyssal plain">
<text>An abyssal plain is an underwater plain on the deep ocean floor, usually found at depths between . Lying generally between the foot of a continental rise and a mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest, and least explored regions on Earth. Abyssal plains are key geologic elements of oceanic basins. (the other elements being an elevated mid-ocean ridge and flanking abyssal hills)

The creation of the abyssal plain is the result of the spreading of the seafloor (plate tectonics) and the melting of the lower oceanic crust. Magma rises from above the asthenosphere (a layer of the upper mantle), and as this basaltic material reaches the surface at mid-ocean ridges, it forms new oceanic crust, which is constantly pulled sideways by spreading of the seafloor. Abyssal plains result from the blanketing of an originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited by turbidity currents that have been channelled from the continental margins along submarine canyons into deeper water. The rest is composed chiefly of pelagic sediments. Metallic nodules are common in some areas of the plains, with varying concentrations of metals, including manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper. There are also amounts of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon, due to material that comes down and decomposes.

Owing in part to their vast size, abyssal plains are believed to be major reservoirs of biodiversity. They also exert significant influence upon ocean carbon cycling, dissolution of calcium carbonate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations over time scales of a hundred to a thousand years. The structure of abyssal ecosystems is strongly influenced by the rate of flux of food to the seafloor and the composition of the material that settles. Factors such as climate change, fishing practices, and ocean fertilization have a substantial effect on patterns of primary production in the euphotic zone. Animals absorb dissolved oxygen from the oxygen-poor waters. Much dissolved oxygen in abyssal plains came from polar regions that had melted long ago. Due to scarcity of oxygen, abyssal plains are inhospitable for organisms that would flourish in the oxygen-enriched waters above. Deep sea coral reefs are mainly found in depths of 3,000 meters and deeper in the abyssal and hadal zones.

Abyssal plains were not recognized as distinct physiographic features of the sea floor until the late 1940s and, until recently, none had been studied on a systematic basis. They are poorly preserved in the sedimentary record, because they tend to be consumed by the subduction process. Due to darkness and a water pressure that can reach about 750 times atmospheric pressure (76 megapascal), abyssal plains are not well explored.

==Oceanic zones==

The ocean can be conceptualized as zones, depending on depth, and presence or absence of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.

The stratum of the water column nearest the surface of the ocean (sea level) is referred to as the photic zone. The photic zone can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of the photic zone, where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, is referred to as the euphotic zone (also referred to as the &quot;epipelagic zone&quot;, or &quot;surface zone&quot;). The lower portion of the photic zone, where the light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called the dysphotic zone (dysphotic means &quot;poorly lit&quot; in Greek). The dysphotic zone is also referred to as the &quot;mesopelagic zone&quot;, or the &quot;twilight zone&quot;. Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1,000 metres.

The euphotic zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as extending from the surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the euphotic zone may extend to a depth of about 150 metres, or rarely, up to 200 metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends from the base of the euphotic zone to about 1,000 metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.

Since the average depth of the ocean is about 4,300 metres, the photic zone represents only a tiny fraction of the ocean&#x27;s total volume. However, due to its capacity for photosynthesis, the photic zone has the greatest biodiversity and biomass of all oceanic zones. Nearly all primary production in the ocean occurs here. Life forms which inhabit the aphotic zone are often capable of movement upwards through the water column into the photic zone for feeding. Otherwise, they must rely on material sinking from above, or find another source of energy and nutrition, such as occurs in chemosynthetic archaea found near hydrothermal vents and cold seeps.

The aphotic zone can be subdivided into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the bathyal zone, extending from a depth of 1,000 metres down to 3,000 metres, with water temperature decreasing from to as depth increases. Next is the abyssal zone, extending from a depth of 3,000 metres down to 6,000 metres. The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches, and is known as the hadal zone. This, the deepest oceanic zone, extends from a depth of 6,000 metres down to approximately 11,034 meters, at the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest point on planet Earth. Abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone, at depths from 3,000 to 6,000 metres.

The table below illustrates the classification of oceanic zones:
==Formation==


Oceanic crust, which forms the bedrock of abyssal plains, is continuously being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) by a process known as decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic crust. Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic crust is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic crust is at the mid-ocean ridges, and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.

The lithosphere, which rides atop the asthenosphere, is divided into a number of tectonic plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Oceanic crust and tectonic plates are formed and move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Abyssal hills are formed by stretching of the oceanic lithosphere. Consumption or destruction of the oceanic lithosphere occurs at oceanic trenches (a type of convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary) by a process known as subduction. Oceanic trenches are found at places where the oceanic lithospheric slabs of two different plates meet, and the denser (older) slab begins to descend back into the mantle. At the consumption edge of the plate (the oceanic trench), the oceanic lithosphere has thermally contracted to become quite dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction. The subduction process consumes older oceanic lithosphere, so oceanic crust is seldom more than 200 million years old. The overall process of repeated cycles of creation and destruction of oceanic crust is known as the Supercontinent cycle, first proposed by Canadian geophysicist and geologist John Tuzo Wilson.

New oceanic crust, closest to the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The roughness of this topography is a function of the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100 mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20 mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.

The flat appearance of mature abyssal plains results from the blanketing of this originally uneven surface of oceanic crust by fine-grained sediments, mainly clay and silt. Much of this sediment is deposited from turbidity currents that have been channeled from the continental margins along submarine canyons down into deeper water. The remainder of the sediment comprises chiefly dust (clay particles) blown out to sea from land, and the remains of small marine plants and animals which sink from the upper layer of the ocean, known as pelagic sediments. The total sediment deposition rate in remote areas is estimated at two to three centimeters per thousand years. Sediment-covered abyssal plains are less common in the Pacific Ocean than in other major ocean basins because sediments from turbidity currents are trapped in oceanic trenches that border the Pacific Ocean.

Abyssal plains are typically covered by deep sea, but during parts of the Messinian salinity crisis much of the Mediterranean Sea&#x27;s abyssal plain was exposed to air as an empty deep hot dry salt-floored sink.

==Discovery==

The landmark scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy survey ship HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; yielded a tremendous amount of bathymetric data, much of which has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained during the course of the Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.

The Challenger expedition was followed by the 1879–1881 expedition of the &quot;Jeannette&quot;, led by United States Navy Lieutenant George Washington DeLong. The team sailed across the Chukchi Sea and recorded meteorological and astronomical data in addition to taking soundings of the seabed. The ship became trapped in the ice pack near Wrangel Island in September 1879, and was ultimately crushed and sunk in June 1881.

The &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition was followed by the 1893–1896 Arctic expedition of Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen aboard the &quot;Fram&quot;, which proved that the Arctic Ocean was a deep oceanic basin, uninterrupted by any significant land masses north of the Eurasian continent.
Beginning in 1916, Canadian physicist Robert William Boyle and other scientists of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research which ultimately led to the development of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.

As technology improved, measurement of depth, latitude and longitude became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of large areas of the ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy &amp; Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.

The Challenger Deep is the deepest surveyed point of all of Earth&#x27;s oceans; it is at the south end of the Mariana Trench near the Mariana Islands group. The depression is named after HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, whose researchers made the first recordings of its depth on 23 March 1875 at station 225. The reported depth was 4,475 fathoms (8184 meters) based on two separate soundings. On 1 June 2009, sonar mapping of the Challenger Deep by the Simrad EM120 multibeam sonar bathymetry system aboard the R/V &quot;Kilo Moana&quot; indicated a maximum depth of 10971 meters (6.82 miles). The sonar system uses phase and amplitude bottom detection, with an accuracy of better than 0.2% of water depth (this is an error of about 22 meters at this depth).

==Terrain features==

===Hydrothermal vents===

A rare but important terrain feature found in the bathyal, abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2 °C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60 °C up to as high as 464 °C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.

At a barometric pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point of water is 375 °C. At a depth of 3,000 meters, the barometric pressure of sea water is more than 300 atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this depth and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407 °C (&quot;see image&quot;). However the increase in salinity at this depth pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, &quot;black smokers&quot; and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.

&quot;Sister Peak&quot; (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −2996 m), &quot;Shrimp Farm&quot; and &quot;Mephisto&quot; (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047 m), are three hydrothermal vents of the black smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to have been active since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407 °C were recorded at one of these vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464 °C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge. The initial stages of a vent chimney begin with the deposition of the mineral anhydrite. Sulfides of copper, iron, and zinc then precipitate in the chimney gaps, making it less porous over the course of time. Vent growths on the order of 30 cm (1 ft) per day have been recorded.[11] An April 2007 exploration of the deep-sea vents off the coast of Fiji found those vents to be a significant source of dissolved iron (see iron cycle).

Hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean typically form along the mid-ocean ridges, such as the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. These are locations where two tectonic plates are diverging and new crust is being formed.

===Cold seeps===

Another unusual feature found in the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, sometimes called a &quot;cold vent&quot;. This is an area of the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often in the form of a deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200 meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.

==Biodiversity==

Though the plains were once assumed to be vast, desert-like habitats, research over the past decade or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.

&quot;Abyssobrotula galatheae&quot;, a species of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one specimen was trawled from a depth of 8370 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (&quot;Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis&quot;) was observed and recorded at a depth of 7700 meters in the Japan Trench. In December 2014 a type of snailfish was filmed at a depth of 8145 meters, followed in May 2017 by another sailfish filmed at 8178 meters. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the family Ipnopidae, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (&quot;Bathypterois longipes&quot;), tripodfish (&quot;Bathypterois grallator&quot;), feeler fish (&quot;Bathypterois longifilis&quot;), and the black lizardfish (&quot;Bathysauropsis gracilis&quot;). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000 meters.

CeDAMar scientists have demonstrated that some abyssal and hadal species have a cosmopolitan distribution. One example of this would be protozoan foraminiferans, certain species of which are distributed from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Other faunal groups, such as the polychaete worms and isopod crustaceans, appear to be endemic to certain specific plains and basins. Many apparently unique taxa of nematode worms have also been recently discovered on abyssal plains. This suggests that the deep ocean has fostered adaptive radiations. The taxonomic composition of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar, but not identical to, that of the North Atlantic. A list of some of the species that have been discovered or redescribed by CeDAMar can be found here.

Eleven of the 31 described species of &quot;Monoplacophora&quot; (a class of mollusks) live below 2000 meters. Of these 11 species, two live exclusively in the hadal zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet been found in the Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the &quot;Polyplacophora&quot; class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000 meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living in a wide range of depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world&#x27;s oceans.

Peracarid crustaceans, including isopods, are known to form a significant part of the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. In 2000, scientists of the &quot;Diversity of the deep Atlantic benthos&quot; (DIVA 1) expedition (cruise M48/1 of the German research vessel RV &quot;Meteor III&quot;) discovered and collected three new species of the Asellota suborder of benthic isopods from the abyssal plains of the Angola Basin in the South Atlantic Ocean. In 2003, De Broyer et al. collected some 68,000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species from baited traps deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands. They found that about 98% of the specimens belonged to the amphipod superfamily &quot;Lysianassoidea&quot;, and 2% to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Half of these species were collected from depths of greater than 1000 meters.

In 2005, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) remotely operated vehicle, KAIKO, collected sediment core from the Challenger Deep. 432 living specimens of soft-walled foraminifera were identified in the sediment samples. Foraminifera are single-celled protists that construct shells. There are an estimated 4,000 species of living foraminifera. Out of the 432 organisms collected, the overwhelming majority of the sample consisted of simple, soft-shelled foraminifera, with others representing species of the complex, multi-chambered genera &quot;Leptohalysis&quot; and &quot;Reophax&quot;. Overall, 85% of the specimens consisted of soft-shelled allogromiids. This is unusual compared to samples of sediment-dwelling organisms from other deep-sea environments, where the percentage of organic-walled foraminifera ranges from 5% to 20% of the total. Small organisms with hard calciferous shells have trouble growing at extreme depths because the water at that depth is severely lacking in calcium carbonate. The giant (5–20 cm) foraminifera known as xenophyophores are only found at depths of 500–10,000 metres, where they can occur in great numbers and greatly increase animal diversity due to their bioturbation and provision of living habitat for small animals.

While similar lifeforms have been known to exist in shallower oceanic trenches (&gt;7,000 m) and on the abyssal plain, the lifeforms discovered in the Challenger Deep may represent independent taxa from those shallower ecosystems. This preponderance of soft-shelled organisms at the Challenger Deep may be a result of selection pressure. Millions of years ago, the Challenger Deep was shallower than it is now. Over the past six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment of that ancient biosphere were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment. Those species that were able to adapt may have been the ancestors of the organisms currently endemic to the Challenger Deep.

Polychaetes occur throughout the Earth&#x27;s oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3 cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete at the bottom of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.

Within the abyssal and hadal zones, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have by far the greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such as those of the sulfide-oxidizing genus &quot;Beggiatoa&quot;), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700 meters.

Probably the most important ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities are considered to be &quot;food limited&quot; because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.

==Exploitation of resources==
In addition to their high biodiversity, abyssal plains are of great current and future commercial and strategic interest. For example, they may be used for the legal and illegal disposal of large structures such as ships and oil rigs, radioactive waste and other hazardous waste, such as munitions. They may also be attractive sites for deep-sea fishing, and extraction of oil and gas and other minerals. Future deep-sea waste disposal activities that could be significant by 2025 include emplacement of sewage and sludge, carbon sequestration, and disposal of dredge spoils.

As fish stocks dwindle in the upper ocean, deep-sea fisheries are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable in the long term given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.

Hydrocarbon exploration in deep water occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil blowout involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500 meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of environmental disaster that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.

Sediments of certain abyssal plains contain abundant mineral resources, notably polymetallic nodules. These potato-sized concretions of manganese, iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper, distributed on the seafloor at depths of greater than 4000 meters, are of significant commercial interest. The area of maximum commercial interest for polymetallic nodule mining (called the Pacific nodule province) lies in international waters of the Pacific Ocean, stretching from 118°–157°, and from 9°–16°N, an area of more than 3 million km2. The abyssal Clarion-Clipperton fracture zone (CCFZ) is an area within the Pacific nodule province that is currently under exploration for its mineral potential.

Eight commercial contractors are currently licensed by the International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area beyond the limits of national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000 km2. When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800 km2 of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000 km2 (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).

Limited knowledge of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000 meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the &quot;Nodinaut&quot; expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its benthic fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the crewed submersible bathyscaphe &quot;Nautile&quot; did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the benthic fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.

<doc id="972804" wikidata="Q4176673" url="?curid=972804" title="Progressive creationism">
<text>Progressive creationism is the religious belief that God created new forms of life gradually over a period of hundreds of millions of years. As a form of old Earth creationism, it accepts mainstream geological and cosmological estimates for the age of the Earth, some tenets of biology such as microevolution as well as archaeology to make its case. In this view creation occurred in rapid bursts in which all &quot;kinds&quot; of plants and animals appear in stages lasting millions of years. The bursts are followed by periods of stasis or equilibrium to accommodate new arrivals. These bursts represent instances of God creating new types of organisms by divine intervention. As viewed from the archaeological record, progressive creationism holds that &quot;species do not gradually appear by the steady transformation of its ancestors; [but] appear all at once and &quot;fully formed.&quot;

The view rejects macroevolution, claiming it is biologically untenable and not supported by the fossil record, as well as rejects the concept of universal descent from a last universal common ancestor. Thus the evidence for macroevolution is claimed to be false, but microevolution is accepted as a genetic parameter designed by the Creator into the fabric of genetics to allow for environmental adaptations and survival. Generally, it is viewed by proponents as a middle ground between literal creationism and theistic evolution.

==Historical development==
At the end of the 18th century, the French anatomist Georges Cuvier proposed that there had been a series of successive creations due to catastrophism. Cuvier believed that God destroyed previously created forms through regional catastrophes such as floods and afterwards repopulated the region with new forms. The French naturalist Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny held similar ideas; he linked different stages in the geologic time scale to separate creation events. At the time these ideas were not popular with strict Christians. In defense of the theory of successive creations, Marcel de Serres (1783–1862), a French geologist, suggested that new creations grow more and more perfect as the time goes on.

The idea that there had been a series of episodes of divine creation of new species with many thousands of years in between them, serving to prepare the world for the eventual arrival of humanity, was popular with Anglican geologists like William Buckland in the early 19th century; they proposed it as an explanation for the patterns of faunal succession in the fossil record that showed that the types of organisms that lived on the earth had changed over time. Buckland explained the idea in detail in his book &quot;Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot; (1836), which was one of the eight &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;. Buckland presented this idea in part to counter pre-Darwin theories on the transmutation of species. The Scottish geologist and evangelical Christian Hugh Miller also argued for many separate creation events brought about by divine interventions, and explained his ideas in his book &quot;The testimony of the rocks; or, Geology in its bearings on the two theologies, natural and revealed&quot; in 1857.

Louis Agassiz, a Swiss-American naturalist, argued for separate divine creations. In his work he noted similarities of distribution of like species in different geological era; a phenomenon clearly not the result of migration. Agassiz questioned how fish of the same species live in lakes well separated with no joining waterway. He concluded they were created at both locations. According to Agassiz the intelligent adaptation of creatures to their environments testified to an intelligent plan. The conclusions of his studies led him to believe that whichever region each animal was found in, it was created there: &quot;animals are naturally autochthones wherever they are found&quot;. After further research he later extended this idea to humans; he wrote that different races had been created separately. This became known as his theory of polygenism.

===Revival===
The American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) was founded in the early 1940s as an organization of orthodox Christian scientists. Although its original leadership favored Biblical literalism and it was intended to be anti-evolutionary, it rejected the creationist theories propounded by George McCready Price (young Earth creationism) and Harry Rimmer (gap creationism), and it was soon moving rapidly in the direction of theistic evolution, with some members &quot;stopping off&quot; on the less Modernist view that they called &quot;progressive creationism.&quot; It was a view developed in the 1930s by Wheaton College graduate Russell L. Mixter. In 1954 Baptist theologian and Christian apologist Bernard Ramm (an associate of the inner circle of the ASA) wrote &quot;The Christian View of Science and Scripture&quot;, advocating Progressive Creationism which did away with the necessity for a young Earth, a global flood and the recent appearance of humans.

==Modern progressive creationism==
In contrast to young Earth creationists, progressive creationists accept the geological column of the progressive appearance of plants and animals through time. To their viewpoint it accurately reflects the order in which God sequentially created kinds of organisms, starting with simple, single-celled organisms and progressing to complex multicellular organisms and the present day. They do not however accept the scientific consensus that these kinds evolved from each other, and believe that kinds are genetically limited, such that one cannot change into another.

Proponents of the Progressive creation theory include astronomer and apologist Hugh Ross, whose organization, Reasons To Believe, accepts the scientifically determined age of the Earth but seeks to disprove Darwinian evolution.

==Interpretation of Genesis==

Bernard Ramm adopted the view (developed by P. J. Wiseman) that &quot;creation was &quot;revealed [pictorially] in six days, not &quot;performed&quot; in six days&quot;, with God intervening periodically to create new &quot;root-species&quot; which then &quot;radiated&quot; out. This allowed geological formations such as coal to form naturally, so that they &quot;might appear a natural product and not an artificial insertion in Nature&quot;, prior to the creation of mankind.

Progressive creationist and astrophysicist Hugh Ross adheres to a literal translation of Genesis 1 and 2 and holds to the principle that &quot;Scripture interprets Scripture” to shed light on the context of the Creation account. Using this principle, Progressive Creationist Alan Hayward cites Hebrews 4, which discusses in the context of the creation story, a continued Seventh Day of creation. Ross ties this literal view of a lengthy seventh day to the Creation account in which he describes the Hebrew word &quot;yom&quot; to have multiple translation possibilities, ranging from 24 hours, year, time, age, or eternity/always. Ross contends that at the end of each Genesis &quot;day&quot;, with the &quot;exception&quot; of the seventh &quot;day&quot;, the phrase, “...and there was evening and there was morning,” is used to put a terminus to each event. The omission of that phrase on the Seventh Day, is in harmony with the literal translation of Hebrews 4’s continuing Seventh Day.

From a theological perspective, Robert Newman addresses a problem with this particular model of lengthy Genesis days, in that it puts physical plant and animal death before the fall of Man, which according to most Young Earth creationism is considered unscriptural. Old Earth creationists interpret death due to the fall of man as spiritual death specifically related to the context of man himself. Another problem with Progressive Creationism is due to the complicated nature of a model that arises from an attempt not to favor science over Scripture and vice versa, potentially angering both schools of thought with this compromise. However, progressive creationists would argue that science and scripture are not conflicting, but rather supporting each other.

<text>The University of Agder (), formerly known as Agder College and Agder University College, is a public university with campuses in Kristiansand and Grimstad, Norway. The institution was established as a university college (&quot;høgskole&quot;) in 1994 through the merger of the Agder University College and five other colleges, including a technical college and a nursing school, and was granted the status of a full university in 2007.

== History ==
The idea of a university in the Agder region is not completely new. In his short period as ruler of the union of Denmark–Norway, Johann Friedrich Struensee planned on reforming the University of Copenhagen. He ordered Bishop Johann Ernst Gunnerus of Trondheim to develop more detailed plans. Gunnerus presented a proposal in 1771 in which he suggested establishing a new university in Norway, and placing it in Kristiansand.

The motives for suggesting Kristiansand as a university town have been debated. Regardless, the idea was soon discarded as planning began for the first Norwegian university. In 1811, a resolution was passed to establish Norway&#x27;s first university in Christiania (Oslo).

Even without a university in the region, and as the need for better educated employees rose, several smaller colleges were established throughout the Agder region. The first, &quot;Christiansands Stiftsseminarium på Holt&quot;, later known as Kristiansand Teacher Training College, was founded at Holt, Aust-Agder in 1839, making it one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Norway. It was followed by Arendal College of Nursing (1920), Agder Music Conservatory (1965), Agder Regional College of Technology (1967), Agder Regional College (1969) and Kristiansand College of Nursing (1976).

Agder University College was established by a merger in 1994, when the six public regional colleges in the Agder counties became one institution. The University College received full university accreditation and became the University of Agder on 1 September 2007.

== Organisation and administration ==

UiA has a shared leadership. The rector, who becomes the head of the university board and bears responsibility for the academic programmes and activities, is elected by the faculty, staff, and students. The university director, by contrast, is the head of administration and is responsible for financial and administrative affairs.

== Student culture ==
At campus Kristiansand, the heart of the university building is the axis that stretches from the &quot;wandering hall&quot; by the main entrance, to the canteen. The library, two cafés, a book store, the largest lecture halls and other facilities are located along this axis.

Every autumn, experienced students organizes events, stands, competitions and &quot;social groups&quot; to welcome the newly arrived students. Students also organizes several cultural, charitable and athletic associations. In addition to this, UiA offers student accommodation on campus as well as a gym.

Virtually all athletic activity at campus Kristiansand is organized by Kristiansand Studentidrettslag (KSI), while the teams at campus Grimstad constitutes Grimstad Studentidrettslag (GSI). Membership is offered to students of UiA and other institutions of higher education in the area only. Sports offered at one or both of the campuses includes football, golf, handball, floorball, basketball, volleyball and multiple martial arts. The male student lacrosse team in Kristiansand is a notable exception, as it operates independently from KSI. Teams from KSI and GSI competes in local leagues as well as selected regional and/or national tournaments.

Students at UiA also organizes several orchestras and choirs, political and non-profit/charitable associations, as well as associations specific to the different programs. The pubs and concert venues &quot;Østsia&quot; (East side/wing) and &quot;Bluebox&quot; is located at campus Kristiansand and Grimstad, respectively. The students at UiA does not shy away from the general nightlife, however, as they frequent the pubs, bars and clubs in downtown Kristiansand and Grimstad.

== Transport and infrastructure ==
Both campuses are located some distance outside their respective city centers, along the E18, one of eastern/southern Norway&#x27;s major roadways (E18 becomes the equally important E39 right after passing the campus in Kristiansand).

== Faculties and academia ==
The University of Agder has six faculties as well as an own unit for teacher education.

<text>James Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Holland Jr. (born September 25, 1977), better known by his stage name Sole, is an American underground hip hop artist from Portland, Maine. He is one of eight co-founders of the record label Anticon. He has been a member of the groups Northern Exposure, Live Poets, Deep Puddle Dynamics, So-Called Artists, Da Babylonianz, Sole and the Skyrider Band and Waco Boyz.

==Career==
Sole recorded his first demo in 1992. At age 15, he assembled 45 Below Records, which included rappers Alias, JD Walker, and producer DJ Moodswing9 (then known as Cuz the Highlander). Sole and Moodswing9 released the album &quot;Mad Skillz and Unpaid Billz&quot; together as Northern Exposure, selling more than 300 copies. They also released 2 12&quot; singles in 1995 and 1997 respectively and album in 1996 named &quot;What It All About&quot; under the name Live Poets. The releases garnered college radio play and sold a few thousand copies.

In early 1998, Sole and rapper Pedestrian coined the name Anticon and together started a collectively owned record label under the name. Later it was set up as a standard corporation with eight shareholders. In the same year, Sole traveled to Minneapolis with Alias and Doseone. They recorded the album &quot;The Taste of Rain... Why Kneel?&quot; as Deep Puddle Dynamics with Slug of Atmosphere. Sole and Pedestrian moved Anticon to Oakland, California.

In 2000, Sole released the first official solo album &quot;Bottle of Humans&quot; on Anticon. As So-Called Artists, he released &quot;Paint by Number Songs&quot; with Alias and DJ Mayonnaise in 2001. Sole&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Selling Live Water&quot; was released in 2003 and received positive reviews; Pitchfork Media gave it a 7.3, Metacritic gave it a score of 77 out of 100.

Later that year, he moved to Barcelona. Two years later, he released the third solo album &quot;Live from Rome&quot; in 2005. Soon after, he moved back to the United States, relocating to Flagstaff, Arizona.

In 2007, Sole released &quot;Sole and the Skyrider Band&quot; as Sole and the Skyrider Band. Its second album &quot;Plastique&quot; was released in 2009. In 2010, Sole left Anticon, citing a desire to further experiment with his music, independently of the collective, and also due to his belief that the label developed away from what he initially intended it to be. Sole and the Skyrider Band then released its third album. &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot; was released in 2011 to generally positive reviews.

Aside from his official releases on Anticon, Sole has also released self-produced albums on his own imprint Black Canyon. These include various compilations of unreleased material, as well as the releases of his Man&#x27;s Best Friend project, various mixtapes, and collaborations with platinum certified producer DJ Pain 1. As he is no longer with Anticon, Sole currently self-releases his solo records.

==Personal life==
Sole is based in Brunswick, Maine. He married Yasamin Al-Hussaini on January 1, 2004, and her name is referenced occasionally in his lyrics. While living in Denver, Sole was active in the local outpost of the Occupy Wall Street political movement, various anarchist projects and hosts a podcast about revolutionary politics and radical philosophy called &quot;The Solecast.&quot;

<text>Li Ao () (772–841), courtesy name Xizhi (), was a Chinese philosopher and prose writer of the Tang dynasty.

==Biography==
Li was born in present-day Tianshui, Gansu, but some accounts relate he was from Zhao, Hebei. After achieving the degree of Jinshi in 798, he joined the imperial bureaucracy and served in the history department at Changan.

In 809, he was assigned to the southern provinces and made the trip with his pregnant wife from Luoyang to Guangzhou over nine months. The course they took included the modern provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Guangdong. His record of the trip, the &quot;Lainan Lu&quot; (來南録, &quot;Record of Coming to the South&quot;), contains detailed descriptions of medieval southern China and is considered one of the earliest forms of the diary.

At the time of his death in Xiangyang, Hubei, Li held the position of Governor of East Shannan Circuit (now Hubei and Henan). There is some debate about the year of his death. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; gives the date of 841. While the Qing dynasty historians, however, have argued that it should be 836.

Late imperial scholars regarded Li as the founder of one of the ten great schools of philosophy in the Tang and Song dynasties. As a philosopher, Li was heavily influenced by Buddhist philosophers like Liang Su and also the great neo-Confucian Han Yu. His extensive writings are preserved in the &quot;Liwengong Wenji&quot; (). This work is presumably a later edition of the ten chapters of the &quot;Li Ao Ji&quot; () as referenced in the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;. Some of the few poems he produced can also be found in the &quot;Quan Tang Shi&quot; ().

Li&#x27;s maternal grandsons Lu Xie and Zheng Tian both served as chancellors under Emperor Xizong of Tang.

<text>Clockwatchers is a 1997 American comedy-drama film co-written and directed by Jill Sprecher. It stars Toni Collette, Parker Posey, Lisa Kudrow, and Alanna Ubach as temporary office staffers in an office complex. The four become misfit friends in an office environment where they are ignored and mistrusted by their co-workers.

==Plot==
Iris is a timid young woman who takes a temporary job at Global Credit, a credit company. She soon befriends assertive and cynical fellow temp Margaret, who teaches Iris the many ways to deal with the crummy world of temping. She introduces Iris to two other temps: aspiring actress Paula eagerly awaits post-work happy hours and the chance to flirt with attractive men, and naive Jane is engaged to marry a man who makes up for his rude behavior by buying her gifts. The four temps forge a camaraderie based on being outsiders at the company.

Margaret is upset when a strange newcomer named Cleo is hired as a permanent employee after one day. Margaret hopes to become an executive assistant to stressed-out manager Mr. Lasky, but her goals are thwarted when he dies of a heart attack. Margaret confides to Iris that her time as a temp will have been worthwhile if she can get a good letter of recommendation.

A series of thefts occur in the office and suspicion falls on the temps, particularly Margaret. Iris&#x27; plastic toy monkey goes missing and when she sees it inside of Margaret&#x27;s desk, Iris loses her faith in Margaret. While walking one day, Iris and Margaret spot Jane&#x27;s fiancé with another woman, but do not do anything about it. At Jane&#x27;s bridal shower, Iris and Margaret confide in Paula, who argues with Margaret, saying that marriage is important to some people.

As the office thefts continue, the women are put under more and more stress which strains their friendship, as all their shoddy desks are put into a fishbowl-type area and they are spied on and searched by the office security guards. Iris finds Paula vomiting in the bathroom on their lunch break. Paula tells Iris she thinks she may be pregnant, but later tells her it was a false alarm. Margaret explains to Iris that Paula typically lies about booking acting roles in order to make herself seem better, while Paula makes it clear she believes Margaret is the office thief.

Eventually, Margaret proposes a one-day strike from work due to mistreatment and being underappreciated as temps, and her friends halfheartedly agree to join her, but none of them follow through and she is fired by HR manager Barbara when she returns. Margaret calls out for support, but none of her friends or co-workers say anything as she is escorted out of the building. Iris regretfully discovers that Margaret did not steal her plastic monkey while she is cleaning out the desk and finds Margaret&#x27;s identical trinket.

The friendship between the temps dissolves, as Jane left the company to get married and Paula was transferred to the accounting department. After moving to another desolate temp desk, Iris throws out a picture she took during a night out with Margaret, Paula, and Jane. She also receives a rejection letter from a job she had applied to at another company and is left with no other options but to keep temping.

When Iris spots Cleo stealing a few items from a senior executive&#x27;s desk, she follows her home and is surprised to see Cleo lives in a mansion. She angrily leaves Cleo a note at work demanding her stolen notebook back; Cleo fishes it out of her purse and hands it to her. At lunch, Iris burns the notebook (which Cleo had drawn inside) in front of Cleo. Cleo later leaves a brand-new notebook on Iris&#x27; desk with the words &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; written inside its first page.

Iris decides to leave Global Credit. On her last day, a pleasant but distant senior executive agrees to sign a glowing pre-written letter of recommendation for her, which contains Margaret&#x27;s name and achievements. Iris then mails the letter of recommendation to Margaret, and resolves that she will no longer be the passive person that she used to be.

<text>Monica Edwards (née Monica le Doux Newton; 8 November 1912 – 18 January 1998) was an English children&#x27;s writer of the mid-twentieth century best known for her Romney Marsh and Punchbowl Farm series of children&#x27;s novels.

==Early life==
She was born in Belper, Derbyshire on 8 November 1912, the third of four children born to the Reverend Harry and Beryl Newton. The family moved to Wakefield, Yorkshire in 1919. As well as being a vicar, Harry Newton was a diocesan exorcist and often took his children with him when performing exorcisms. In 1927 the family moved to Rye Harbour in Romney Marsh, Sussex where Harry Newton remained as vicar until 1936. The young Monica Newton received a fragmentary formal education: she is known to have attended Wakefield Girls&#x27; High School between September 1920 and July 1921 and when the family were living at Rye Harbour she was sent to St Brandon&#x27;s School, Bristol where she remained for just three months in 1928 before returning to Sussex. She received no further formal education.

==The &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; disaster==
In November 1928 Edwards witnessed the capsizing of the supposedly unsinkable &quot;Mary Stanford&quot; lifeboat in Rye Bay with the loss of all aboard. 
The unprecedented mass funeral, which was attended by representatives of King George V, the Government and the Armed Services, was conducted by her father, the
Reverend Harry Newton.
Edwards knew all seventeen crew-members personally but was especially close to Charlie Southerden. In a letter to a school friend in January 1930 she described Charlie, who was six years older than she was, as her &quot;boy friend&quot; although the relationship was not public knowledge because of the difference in their age and social class. Much later she wrote a fictional account of the lifeboat disaster in &quot;Storm Ahead&quot;, published in 1953.

==Marriage==
Monica Newton married William &quot;Bill&quot; Edwards in November 1933 (two days after her twenty-first birthday) in the face of opposition from both families. Bill was an athletic and charismatic man ten years older than her and a lorry-driver by profession. After living in a variety of places, including Udimore in Sussex; Croft in Leicestershire and Send, near Woking in Surrey, they eventually bought Pitlands Farm (in Thursley, Surrey) at auction in 1947 and renamed it Punch Bowl Farm.

==The Punch Bowl Farm series==
Between 1947 and 1968 Bill and Monica Edwards gradually built up the near-derelict farm into a thriving dairy concern stocked exclusively with pedigree Jersey cattle. During this time she wrote ten Punchbowl Farm novels with the farm and its surroundings as their setting. Although the real name of the farm was Punch Bowl Farm, the fictional name was contracted to Punchbowl (as was the herd name of the Jersey cattle at the real farm) and Thursley&#x27;s name was changed to Highnoons for the books. The characters of this series of books were the Thornton family – principally the children Andrea, Dion, Lindsey and Peter. The first book in the series (&quot;No Mistaking Corker&quot;) was written before the purchase of the farm.

The complete list of Punchbowl Farm novels is:
*&quot;No Mistaking Corker&quot; (1947)
*&quot;Black Hunting Whip&quot; (1950)
*&quot;Punchbowl Midnight&quot; (1951)
*&quot;Spirit of Punchbowl Farm&quot; (1952)
*&quot;The Wanderer&quot; (1953)
*&quot;Punchbowl Harvest&quot; (1954)
*&quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1956)
*&quot;The Cownappers&quot; (1958)
*&quot;The Outsider&quot; (1961)
*&quot;Fire in the Punchbowl&quot; (1965)
*&quot;The Wild One&quot; (1967)

The Edwards family&#x27;s farm life was brought to a close in August 1968 when Bill had a near-fatal tractor accident. The couple eventually sold the farm and built a retirement bungalow for themselves in one of the farm&#x27;s fields.

==Romney Marsh series==
Beginning with &quot;Wish for a Pony&quot; in 1947, Edwards altogether wrote fifteen titles in the Romney Marsh series of novels. These were set in the village of Rye Harbour which was renamed Westling. The Romney Marsh towns of Rye and Winchelsea were also renamed Dunsford and Winklesea respectively. The stories feature many real-life characters (with changed names) which the author remembered from her childhood there, such as the ferryman Jim Decks and the villainous Hookey Galley. The principal characters in the novels are Tamzin Grey, Rissa Birnie, Meryon Fairbrass and Roger Lambert. Tamzin&#x27;s father, the Reverend Richard Grey, was based on Edwards&#x27; father, the Reverend Harry Newton.

The complete list of Romney Marsh novels is:
*&quot;Wish for a Pony&quot; (1947)
*&quot;The Summer of the Great Secret&quot; (1948)
*&quot;The Midnight Horse&quot; (1949)
*&quot;The White Riders&quot; (1950)
*&quot;Cargo of Horses&quot; (1951)
*&quot;Hidden in a Dream&quot; (1952)
*&quot;Storm Ahead&quot; (1953)
*&quot;No Entry&quot; (1954)
*&quot;The Nightbird&quot; (1955)
*&quot;Operation Seabird&quot; (1957)
*&quot;Strangers to the Marsh&quot; (1957)
*&quot;No Going Back&quot; (1960)
*&quot;The Hoodwinkers&quot; (1962)
*&quot;Dolphin Summer&quot; (1963)
*&quot;A Wind Is Blowing&quot; (1969)

==Publishers==
When she wrote &quot;Wish for a Pony&quot; Edwards did not realize that finding an agent would be a necessary step to having the story published. Instead she simply sent it to Collins (now HarperCollins), who accepted it for publication. She quickly came to dislike the book:
&quot;Monica Edwards wanted to alter much of &quot;Wish for a Pony&quot; soon after it was published but Collins told her they would only publish her next story (&quot;No Mistaking Corker&quot;) if &quot;Wish for a Pony&quot; remained as it was.&quot;
All the books in the two series were published by Collins, but abridged versions of some of the titles in both series were published as Armada paperbacks. The non-series book &quot;Under The Rose&quot; was also published by Collins.

Edwards&#x27; chief illustrator was Geoffrey Whittam, although the first four books (&quot;Wish for a Pony, No Mistaking Corker, The Summer of the Great Secret&quot; and &quot;The Midnight Horse&quot;) had illustrations by Anne Bullen; Joan Wanklyn illustrated &quot;Spirit of Punchbowl Farm&quot;, &quot;The Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Punchbowl Harvest&quot;, and Charles Tunnicliffe illustrated &quot;Punchbowl Midnight&quot;.

In the 1980s John Goodchild published new versions of some of the earlier titles. These versions were updated by the author to make them less rooted in the 1950s. However, Goodchild died before &quot;Storm Ahead&quot; was published and the project was abandoned. Reprints of the original books have been published by Girls Gone By Publishers, starting in 2005 with &quot;Storm Ahead&quot;.

A biography of Edwards by Brian Parks was published by Girls Gone By Publishers in 2010. Parks also wrote a Companion to the Romney Marsh series of books, which was published in July 2006.

<text>House of Stairs is a lithograph print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher first printed in November 1951. This print measures . It depicts the interior of a tall structure crisscrossed with stairs and doorways.

A total of 46 &quot;wentelteefje&quot; (imaginary creatures created by Escher) are crawling on the stairs. The &quot;wentelteefje&quot; has a long, armored body with six legs, humanoid feet, a parrot-like beak and eyes on stalks. Some are seen to roll in through doors, wound in a wheel shape and then unroll to crawl up the stairs, while others crawl down stairs and wind up to roll out. The &quot;wentelteefje&quot; first appeared earlier the same month in the lithograph &quot;Curl-up&quot;. Later that month, &quot;House of Stairs&quot; was extended to a vertical length of in a print titled &quot;House of Stairs II&quot; by repeating and mirroring some of the architecture and creatures.

<text>Raw Like Sushi is the debut studio album by Swedish musician Neneh Cherry, released 5 June 1989 by Virgin Records. The album includes the commercially successful single &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot;.

== Background ==
An early version of &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; appeared on the B-side of the 1986 Stock Aitken Waterman-produced Morgan-McVey single, &quot;Looking Good Diving&quot;, titled &quot;Looking Good Diving with the Wild Bunch&quot;. The single was not successful; however, the B-side was re-recorded with Tim Simenon of Bomb the Bass, and became the version of &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; that was a worldwide hit, reaching No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 1 in the Netherlands and Sweden. The album also contains the No. 8 US (and No. 20 UK) hit &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot;, and the No. 5 UK hit &quot;Manchild&quot;.

All musicians and programmers are credited in the album sleeve, however Cameron McVey, Cherry&#x27;s husband, is credited as &quot;Booga Bear&quot;. Massive Attack&#x27;s Robert Del Naja co-wrote &quot;Manchild&quot;, and fellow member Andrew Vowles aka DJ Mushroom performs on &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;So Here I Come&quot;. &quot;My Bitch&quot; is a vocal duet with Gilly G.

The cover and inner photos were shot by fashion photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino.

== Music ==
&quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot; is distinctive for its eclectic mix of genres, incorporating influences from across the trends of 1980s pop music. Cherry sings and raps accompanied by a diverse set of sounds, including pianos, synthesizers, brass instruments, guitars, and go-go percussion. The album&#x27;s lyrical themes are influenced by Cherry&#x27;s experiences of motherhood, and her education and upbringing.

When it was released, the album was favorably compared to Madonna and Prince, though it did not reach similar popularity.

== Reception ==
&quot;NME&quot; critic David Quantick praised &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot; as &quot;the sort of record you can rarely buy – immediate, commercial pop that only someone with a rather individual worldview could have made&quot;, highlighting its unconventional song structures and Cherry&#x27;s &quot;wit, intelligence and even maturity.&quot; Selina Webb of British music newspaper &quot;Music Week&quot; called it &quot;eclectic, wholesome, a subtly teasing collection of provoking yet pouting songs&quot;, &quot;a confident manifesto from refreshing new pop diva.&quot; Pete Clark of &quot;Hi-Fi News &amp; Record Review&quot; said that Cherry&#x27;s music &quot;is illuminated by a jazzy delight in non-conformity&quot; and singled out &quot;effortlessly memorable&quot; &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; and &quot;Manchild&quot;. As per Chris Murray of &quot;RPM&quot; &quot;this package contains something for any contemporary dance music fan.&quot;

&quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot; is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Markos Moulitsas Zúniga (; born September 11, 1971), often known by his username and former military nickname &quot;Kos&quot; ( ), is an American blogger who is the founder and publisher of Daily Kos, a blog focusing on liberal and Democratic Party politics in the United States. He co-founded SB Nation, a collection of sports blogs, which is now a part of Vox Media.

==Early life and education ==
Moulitsas was born in Chicago to a Salvadoran mother and a Greek father. He moved with his family to El Salvador in 1976, but later returned to the Chicago area in 1980 after his family fled when threats were placed on their lives by communist insurgents during the Salvadoran Civil War. As an adult, he has recounted his memories of the civil war, including an incident that occurred when he was 8 years old, in which he saw communist guerrillas murdering students who had been accused of collaborating with the government.

After graduating from Schaumburg High School in Schaumburg, Illinois, he served in the U.S. Army from 1989 through 1992. He completed training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and fulfilled his three-year enlistment as a Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) Fire Direction Specialist while stationed in Bamberg, Bavaria, Germany.

By his own account, he &quot;missed deploying to the Gulf War by a hair.&quot; Moulitsas has described the Army as &quot;perhaps the ideal society – we worked hard but the Army took care of us in return.&quot;

Prior to enlisting in the Army, Moulitsas was a member of the Republican Party. During the 1988 presidential election, he served as a Republican precinct captain and assisted with the re-election campaign of Illinois Congressman Henry Hyde. However, during his time in the military Moulitsas began a transition in his political philosophy that would lead him to change his party affiliation from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party.

After leaving the army, he attended Northern Illinois University (NIU) and graduated in 1996 with two bachelor&#x27;s degrees, majoring in philosophy, journalism, and political science. While attending, he wrote for the college newspaper, the Northern Star. Further illustrating the transition of his political philosophy, now a staunch supporter of gay rights, in 1993 while a freshman at NIU, he penned an opinion piece for the Northern Star denouncing efforts being made to lift the ban on homosexuals serving in the military. As a writer, he also questioned NIU&#x27;s policy of spending student fee money on athletic programs, generating a negative response from school officials, and waged an unsuccessful campaign to save the school&#x27;s journalism program. In 2007, he was inducted into the Northern Star Hall of Fame, an honor bestowed by the newspaper&#x27;s alumni association.

Moulitsas attended the Boston University School of Law from 1996 to 1999, earning a J.D. degree. He then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he worked as a project manager at a web development shop.

== Personal life ==
He describes himself as a recovering Catholic, and says that while he has many problems with the Church, Salvadoran martyr and archbishop Óscar Romero is still his greatest hero and inspiration.

Moulitsas has prosopagnosia, which makes it difficult to recognize familiar faces.

Moulitsas currently resides in Berkeley, California, with his two children.

==Career==
===Daily Kos===
Moulitsas founded his blog, &quot;Daily Kos&quot; in May 2002, and has managed the blog as a full-time occupation since early 2004. It has become the largest liberal community blog in the United States, with over 2.3 million registered users and 8 million unique viewers per month as of July 2018.

The popularity of &quot;Daily Kos&quot; has attracted the attention of many Democratic senators, members of Congress, governors and candidates who have posted on the site, including Senators John Kerry and Barbara Boxer, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, former President Jimmy Carter, and former President Barack Obama. &quot;Daily Kos&quot; has also spawned an annual conference. The inaugural YearlyKos was held from June 8 to 11, 2006, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Guests included Harry Reid, then-Virginia Governor Mark Warner, and Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean. The conference has since been renamed Netroots Nation.

In April 2004, Moulitsas and &quot;Daily Kos&quot; made controversial comments in a blog post about Blackwater USA after some of its employees were killed and mutilated in Fallujah The next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks.

On March 17, 2008, Moulitsas wrote that Senator Hillary Clinton, who was then involved in a protracted race against Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination, &quot;doesn&#x27;t deserve fairness on this site&quot; because she &quot;fails the test of the guiding principles of this site&quot; and because Clinton had &quot;no reasonable chance of victory&quot;. His statement was precipitated by a &quot;strike&quot; conducted by several pro-Clinton diarists, even though none of these posters was paid or in any way officially linked to the site. Moulitsas responded directly to the &quot;strike&quot; by saying that it was more like a &quot;boycott&quot;, noting that &quot;It&#x27;s a big Internet, so I hope they find what they&#x27;re looking for.&quot;

===Consultant and entrepreneur===
In 2004, Markos and Jerome Armstrong of MyDD founded BlogPAC, a political action committee focused on progressive bloggers and politics online. In 2012, he was, by some measures, the most accurate major pundit to predict the result of the presidential election.

During the 2005 United Kingdom general election, Moulitsas was hired by the British daily newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to write elections analysis for its weblog. Moulitsas was also a regular contributor to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, having been hired by the magazine for its 2008 presidential campaign coverage.

Moulitsas is a fellow at the New Politics Institute, a think tank of the New Democrat Network, which was founded by Simon Rosenberg in 1996. The NDN&#x27;s stated purpose is to help elect centrist Democrats, and is considered by many to be a successor to the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), an organization that Simon Rosenberg resigned from in 1996.

In addition to political pursuits, Moulitsas co-founded SB Nation, a network of sports blogs, with Tyler Bleszinski (of Athletics Nation) in 2003. The network now covers all major American leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL), as well as dozens of colleges and other specific sports like golf, cycling, and ultimate fighting.

In 2011, SB Nation became Vox Media and began expanding, raising capital to acquire and develop other blog networks. Vox Media now owns eight media brands covering news, technology, sports, and lifestyle.

In March 2018, Moulitsas announced the launch of Civiqs, a polling and data operation that tracks opinions on candidates, issues, and elected officials.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Moulitsas addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He concluded, &quot;The American Dream claims that &quot;anyone&quot; seeking a better life can aspire to rise above their station, and &quot;everyone&quot; has an equal opportunity to become something better. That is our unifying narrative.&quot;

===Books===
Moulitsas has authored three books:
*&quot;Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People Powered Politics&quot; (Chelsea Green, 2006); (co-written with Jerome Armstrong)
*&quot;Taking On the System: Rules for Radical Change in a Digital Era&quot; (Penguin Group, 2008); 
*&quot;American Taliban: How War, Sex, Sin, and Power Bind Jihadists and the Radical Right&quot; (Polipoint Press, 2010);

<doc id="972830" wikidata="Q139961" url="?curid=972830" title="Zackie Achmat">
<text>Abdurrazack &quot;Zackie&quot; Achmat (born 21 March 1962) is a South African activist and film director. He is a co-founder the Treatment Action Campaign and known worldwide for his activism on behalf of people living with HIV and AIDS in South Africa. He served as board member and co-director of Ndifuna Ukwazi (Dare to Know), an organisation which aims to build and support social justice organisations and leaders, and was the chairperson of Equal Education. In 2024, he stood as independent candidate in the South African National Elections. However, he did not garner enough support to secure a seat in parliament.

==Early life and education==
Achmat was born in the Johannesburg suburb of Vrededorp to a Muslim Cape Malay family and grew up in the Cape Coloured community in Salt River during apartheid. He was raised by his mother and his aunt who were both shop stewards for the Garment Workers Union.

He did not matriculate but nevertheless graduated with a BA Hons degree in English literature from the University of the Western Cape in 1992 and studied filmmaking at the Cape Town Film School.

==Political activism==
Achmat set fire to his school in Salt River in support of the 1976 student protests and was imprisoned several times during his youth for political activities. He joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1980 while serving time in prison. Between 1985 and 1990 he was a member of the Marxist Workers Tendency of the ANC, a Trotskyist breakaway group of the ANC and precursor to the Democratic Socialist Movement.

Achmat describes his political ideology as democratic socialist since the unbanning of the ANC in 1990. Despite being a member of the ANC, he vigorously opposed the HIV/AIDS denialism promoted by former President Thabo Mbeki and other senior ANC members and in 2004 he withdrew his ANC membership under Mbeki&#x27;s leadership. In 2006, Achmat called on fellow party members to formulate appropriate HIV policies and oust Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang. He has also been outspoken in his criticism of President Jacob Zuma and ANC corruption.

Achmat stood as an independent for national parliament on the Western Cape regional list in the 2024 South African general election. Achmat received 10679 votes, which does not reach the minimum threshold required to gain a seat in the National Assembly. He conceded defeat and vowed to continue politics by contesting in the 2026 local elections.

==LGBT rights activism==
Achmat co-founded the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality in 1994, and as its director he ensured protections for gays and lesbians in the new South African Constitution, and facilitated the prosecution of cases that led to the decriminalisation of sodomy and granting of equal status to same-sex partners in the immigration process. Achmat wrote a much-cited article about sexuality in South African prisons, based on his personal experiences.

==HIV/AIDS activism==

Before co-founding the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) in 1998, Achmat was a director of the AIDS Law Project based out of the University of the Witwatersrand, which is now headed by Achmat&#x27;s longtime collaborator Mark Heywood. The AIDS Law Project and TAC work closely together in all the legal matters that arise in the course of advocating for the right to health, including prosecuting cases and defending TAC volunteers.

===Solidarity with people living with HIV and AIDS in South Africa===
Achmat publicly announced his HIV-positive status in 1998 and stated that he was refusing to take antiretroviral drugs until all who needed them had access to them. He began taking antiretrovirals in August 2003 when a national congress of TAC activists voted to urge him to begin antiretroviral treatment. He finally announced that he would start treatment shortly before the government announced that it would make antiretrovirals available in the public sector. Achmat&#x27;s motives have never been independently established and he does not mention this incident in affidavits that he has submitted on public interest matters containing his life history.

===Westville Prison incident===
Achmat was one of 44 TAC activists arrested in 2006 for occupying provincial government offices in Cape Town as a protest in order to call for Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and Correctional Services Minister Ngconde Balfour to be charged with culpable homicide for the death of an HIV-positive inmate at Westville Prison in Durban. The protesters were charged with trespassing and ordered to appear before court. The inmate was one of 15 prisoners who were plaintiffs in a case against the Departments of Health and Correctional Services, suing to be provided access to antiretroviral drugs. The court ordered the government to provide the drugs immediately.

==Social justice activism==
In 2008, Achmat co-founded the Social Justice Coalition (SJC), an organisation with the aim of promoting the rights enshrined in South Africa&#x27;s Constitution, particularly among poor and unemployed people living in the country. In 2009 he co-founded the Centre for Law and Social Justice, subsequently renamed Ndifuna Ukwazi (Dare to Know), with Gavin Silber.

In 2013, Achmat and 18 other SJC activists were arrested for an illegal gathering outside the Cape Town Civic Centre, where they were protesting about sanitation services in the township of Khayelitsha.

==Allegations of sexual harassment cover up==
In 2018, Achmat was accused of intimidating women against speaking about sexual harassment while he was the chair of the board of Equal Education, specifically regarding allegations against Doron Isaacs. Achmat has denied the claims, while also publicly defending Isaacs, stating that he does not believe Isaacs is a sexual predator. Achmat denied threatening complainants but admitted that he had &quot;spoken firmly to people who have spread rumours or allegations of sexual or other misconduct without evidence as fact or faith&quot;. Achmat has also boasted about being feared by people in South African civil society. In the same radio interview Achmat claimed that he had heard rumours that his interviewer had stolen money and suggested that one of Isaacs&#x27; accusers was not credible because she had been gang-raped as a volunteer.

Achmat joined calls for a public inquiry into Equal Education&#x27;s handling of allegations of sexual misconduct in the organisation. Equal Education appointed retired judge Kathleen Satchwell to head an inquiry into the allegations. The Satchwell inquiry found that the allegations against Achmat and Isaacs were baseless. Judge Satchwell likened the accusations to the &quot;gutter journalism&quot; of the Apartheid era in which &quot;untested propaganda could rule the roost”.

However, one member of Satchwell&#x27;s three person inquiry, former United Nations&#x27; Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women Rashida Manjoo, dissented on the basis that she wished to take into considerations the anonymous allegations that were rejected by Satchwell. There was a total of 19 anonymous submissions through the Women&#x27;s Legal Centre that were rejected by the commission.

In 2020 Achmat became a director of Karoo Biosciences, which was a company established by Doron Isaacs.

==Personal life==
Achmat was diagnosed HIV-positive in 1990. In 2005 he had a heart attack, which his doctor said was unlikely to be caused by his HIV-positive status or treatment. He recovered sufficiently to return to his activism work.

On 5 January 2008, Achmat married his partner and fellow activist Dalli Weyers at a ceremony in the Cape Town suburb of Lakeside. The ceremony was attended by then Mayor Helen Zille and presided over by his close friend Supreme Court of Appeal judge Edwin Cameron. The couple divorced amicably in June 2011.

<doc id="972840" wikidata="Q364335" url="?curid=972840" title="Mike Conley Sr.">
<text>Michael Alexander Conley Sr. (born October 5, 1962) is an American former track and field athlete who competed primarily in the triple jump and the long jump. In the triple jump, he won an Olympic gold medal in 1992, silver in 1984, and gold in the 1993 World Championship.

Conley&#x27;s son, Mike Conley Jr., is a professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

==Competitive career==
Conley competed collegiately at the University of Arkansas where he won 9 NCAA long jump and triple jump titles. Conley was ranked #1 in the United States 9 times in the triple jump during his professional career. Conley is the former world indoor triple jump record holder and he still holds the U.S. indoor record in the triple jump at 17.76 meters (58 feet, 3.25 inches).

Conley was ranked #1 in the world 6 times in the Triple Jump during his career and was ranked 8th in the U.S. in the 200 meter dash in 1985.
Conley received the USATF Jim Thorpe Award in 1986 and 1992 as the top field events athlete in the U.S. In 2004, Conley was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame.

A basketball player at the point guard position in Luther High School South in Chicago and in college (only during his freshman year), Conley relied on those skills in winning the Foot Locker Celebrity Slam Dunk Contest in 1988, 1989 and 1992, where he also made the longest dunk ever, a dunk from 2&quot; behind the free-throw line in the final against Olympic long jumper, Mike Powell.

==Post-competitive career==
Conley was president and remains on the board of directors of World Sport Chicago, the &quot;living legacy&quot; of Chicago&#x27;s 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Bid, that focuses on promoting and developing sport programs and events for the youth of Chicago. Chicago had been selected as the U.S. entry into the bid process. Previously, he was the executive director of Elite Athlete&#x27;s program for USA Track and Field.

Conley is presently serving as chairman on the High Performance committee for USATF.

Conley is also CEO of (MMG) a Sports Management Group as well as CEO of hydrogen-infused water company HTWO.

Conley is registered with the NBA as an agent and represented his son, Mike Conley Jr., and his son&#x27;s Ohio State teammates Greg Oden and Daequan Cook when they entered the league and currently represents fellow University of Arkansas alum Isaiah Joe of the Oklahoma City Thunder.
Oden officially declared for the NBA draft by signing with Mike Sr. as his agent and was subsequently chosen as the number one player in the 2007 NBA draft. Conley Jr. was selected fourth overall. Cook was drafted 21st.

==Rankings==
Conley had a particularly long and prolific career and he was considered among the world&#x27;s best for over a decade. &quot;Track and Field News&quot; ranked him among the top ten triple jumpers in the world 14 consecutive years (six times as world&#x27;s best) and seven times in the long jump.

Conley was ranked 8th in the U.S. in the 200 meter dash in 1985.
==Personal life==
Conley is married to René Corbin Conley and is the father of Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Mike Conley Jr., Jordan Conley, Sydney Conley (All-American long jumper at the University of Kansas), and Jon Conley. He is the elder brother of former American football linebacker Steve Conley.

<doc id="972842" wikidata="Q1053985" url="?curid=972842" title="CQUniversity Australia">
<text>Central Queensland University (branded as CQUniversity) is an Australian public university based in central Queensland. CQUniversity is the only Australian university with a campus presence in every mainland state. Its main campus is at Norman Gardens in Rockhampton, however, it also has campuses in Adelaide (Wayville), Brisbane, Bundaberg (Branyan), Cairns, Emerald, Gladstone (South Gladstone and Callemondah), Mackay (central business district and Ooralea), Melbourne, Noosa, Perth, Rockhampton City, Sydney and Townsville. CQUniversity also partners with university centres in several regional areas across Australia.

The university was established in 1967 in Parkhurst as the Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) and achieved full university status as the University of Central Queensland in 1992 before being renamed Central Queensland University in 1994.

== History ==

=== Pre-1958: Push for University Decentralisation in Queensland ===
In 1941, the Queensland Labor Premier, William Forgan Smith, introduced section 17 of the National Education Co-ordination and University of Queensland Amendment Act, which provided for the creation of university colleges outside Brisbane. In 1944 and 1945, a series of Rockhampton delegations lobbied the Queensland government for a university college, but after the University of Queensland established a network of provincial study centres in the late 1940s the issue became dormant.

Rockhampton&#x27;s university campaign resumed in the 1950s as Central Queensland became an emerging heavy industry base, with developing coal mines and Gladstone emerging as a light metals centre. In the Queensland parliament in November 1956, the local member for Rockhampton (H R Gardner) stated &quot;more adequate facilities for technical education&quot; were required for the region and, appealing to the philosophy of a &quot;fair go&quot;, he urged that Rockhampton people be given &quot;the same opportunities as those in Brisbane&quot;. In 1958, P J Goldston, an engineer (later, Commissioner for Railways,) mooted the possibility of a Central Queensland university with Rockhampton engineers.

=== 1958 to 1967: Central Queensland University Development Association (UDA) ===
After further community discussion, the Central Queensland University Development Association (UDA) was constituted. The Rockhampton Mayor, Alderman Rex Pilbeam, called the first public meeting of UDA on 3 March 1959.

The UDA presented university proposals to government and, in 1961, the Queensland government reserved 161 hectares (400 acres) of government land at Parkhurst (North Rockhampton) on the Bruce Highway near the Yeppoon turnoff as a tertiary education site. Establishment finally was resolved in March 1965, when the Commonwealth government&#x27;s Martin Report (on expansion of tertiary education) was tabled in parliament by Prime Minister Menzies―who announced the foundation of a new style of tertiary institution at both Rockhampton and Toowoomba. The new institutes were to be affiliated with the main Queensland Institute of Technology campus in Brisbane and lacked the autonomy of universities, being controlled by the Queensland Department of Education.

=== 1967 to 1971: Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) (QITC) ===
The Queensland Institute of Technology (Capricornia) first opened in February 1967 without a permanent campus or significant development of buildings. The initial intake was 71 full-time and part-time students. While building progressed at Parkhurst, the first classes were held on the top floor of the Technical College in Bolsover Street, which lacked laboratories, library facilities or stock. 

By 1969, most staff and students transferred to the Parkhurst campus, still a bushland site in progress. In the summer months, the campus was often ringed by spectacular bush fires or deluged with torrential rain: cars slid in the mud or were bogged and the QITC&#x27;s foundation Principal, Dr Allan Skertchly, ferried people in his 4WD across floodwaters. Some students slept temporarily on mattresses in the canteen while waiting for the first residential college to open.

===1971 to 1989: Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education (CIAE)===

After the passage of the amended Education Act in 1971, QITC became an autonomous, multi-functional college under the control of its own council and took the name of Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education (CIAE).

Along with creating a traditional university campus experience in a natural setting, the CIAE also developed engineering and science projects. The CIAE became the first college in Australia to introduce a Bachelor of Science externally in 1974.

By 1979, external enrolments at the CIAE had increased to 825 and by 1985 distance education had become a major campus operation, exceeding internal enrolments and offering 12 courses involving some 100 subjects and processing 23,980 study packages annually.

Between 1978 and 1989, the CIAE established branch campuses in Central Queensland at Gladstone, Mackay, Bundaberg and Emerald.

=== 1990 to 1991: University College of Central Queensland (UCCQ) ===
The Capricornia Institute of Advanced Education became the University College of Central Queensland in 1990 under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland. 

=== 1992 to 1994: University of Central Queensland (UCQ) ===
The University College of Central Queensland became the University of Central Queensland in 1992 when it gained full university status. 

=== 1994 to present: Central Queensland University (CQUniversity) ===
In 1994, the name Central Queensland University was adopted. In 2008 it was rebranded with the current title of CQUniversity Australia. In 2001, the university appointed Queensland&#x27;s first female Vice-Chancellor, Professor Glenice Hancock, who retired in 2004.

From 2009 onward, CQUniversity launched a new strategic plan to grow student numbers and expand course offerings, especially within the health disciplines. New course offerings included physiotherapy, podiatry, occupational therapy, speech pathology, oral health sonography, and medical imaging. CQUniversity also delivers courses in discipline areas including apprenticeships, trades and training, business, accounting and law, creative, performing and visual arts, education and humanities, engineering and built environment, health, information technology and digital media, psychology, social work and community services, science and environment, and work and study preparation.

In 2014, CQUniversity merged with CQ TAFE to establish Queensland&#x27;s first dual sector university. CQUniversity is now the public provider of TAFE in the central Queensland region and also delivers vocational courses at other locations across Australia and online. Following the merger CQUniversity now delivers more than 300 courses from short courses through to PhDs.

CQUniversity is the only Australian university to be accredited as a Changemaker Campus by global social innovation group Ashoka U.

In March 2018 the university announced it was in talks to establish a medical school at its Rockhampton and Bundaberg campuses. Discussions are with the Hospital and Health Services of Central Queensland and Wide Bay, the main physical organisation of Queensland Health in the two regions.

<text>Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol) or CCM mode Protocol (CCMP) is an authenticated encryption protocol designed for Wireless LAN products that implements the standards of the IEEE 802.11i amendment to the original IEEE 802.11 standard. CCMP is a data cryptographic encapsulation mechanism designed for data confidentiality, integrity and authentication. It is based upon the Counter Mode with CBC-MAC (CCM mode) of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) standard. It was created to address the vulnerabilities presented by Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), a dated, insecure protocol.

==Technical details==

CCMP uses CCM that combines CTR mode for data confidentiality and cipher block chaining message authentication code (CBC-MAC) for authentication and integrity. CCM protects the integrity of both the MPDU data field and selected portions of the IEEE 802.11 MPDU header. CCMP is based on AES processing and uses a 128-bit key and a 128-bit block size. CCMP uses CCM with the following two parameters:
* M = 8; indicating that the MIC is 8 octets (eight bytes).
* L = 2; indicating that the Length field is 2 octets.

A CCMP Medium Access Control Protocol Data Unit (MPDU) comprises five sections. The first is the MAC header which contains the destination and source address of the data packet. The second is the CCMP header which is composed of 8 octets and consists of the packet number (PN), the Ext IV, and the key ID. The packet number is a 48-bit number stored across 6 octets. The PN codes are the first two and last four octets of the CCMP header and are incremented for each subsequent packet. Between the PN codes are a reserved octet and a Key ID octet. The Key ID octet contains the Ext IV (bit 5), Key ID (bits 6–7), and a reserved subfield (bits 0–4). CCMP uses these values to encrypt the data unit and the MIC. The third section is the data unit which is the data being sent in the packet. The fourth is the message integrity code (MIC) which protects the integrity and authenticity of the packet. Finally, the fifth is the frame check sequence (FCS) which is used for error detection and correction. Of these sections only the data unit and MIC are encrypted.

==Security==
CCMP is the standard encryption protocol for use with the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) standard and is much more secure than the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) protocol and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). CCMP provides the following security services:
* Data confidentiality; ensures only authorized parties can access the information
* Authentication; provides proof of genuineness of the user
* Access control in conjunction with layer management

Because CCMP is a block cipher mode using a 128-bit key, it is secure against attacks to the 264 steps of operation. Generic meet-in-the-middle attacks do exist and can be used to limit the theoretical strength of the key to 2&quot;n&quot;/2 (where &quot;n&quot; is the number of bits in the key) operations needed.

<text>Inessa Mykolayivna Kravets (née Shulyak, ; born 5 October 1966) is a Ukrainian former triple jumper and long jumper. She was among the most prominent female triple jumpers during the period that the event was added to competition programmes at major competitions, and she was the world record holder, until the 2021 Olympics when Yulimar Rojas broke her record. Her record was one of the most durable in women&#x27;s athletics.

==Career==
Born in Dnipropetrovsk, her breakthrough in the triple jump came in 1991 when she broke the world record with a clearance of 14.95 metres in June. Her first major medals came in 1992. At the inaugural appearance of the women&#x27;s triple jump at the 1992 European Athletics Indoor Championships she won the gold medal. Later that year at the 1992 Summer Olympics she claimed the long jump silver as part of the Unified Team.

She followed this with a gold medal at the first women&#x27;s triple jump at the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships, but due to a doping ban she did not compete at the debut of the event at the 1993 World Championships in Athletics, where Russia&#x27;s Anna Biryukova took the title. In 1994 she won the long jump at the 1994 IAAF World Cup and doubled up at the 1994 European Athletics Championships to take long jump silver and triple jump bronze.

She jumped the world record at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg with 15.50 metres after studying a picture of Jonathan Edwards. The following year she won the Olympic gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, becoming the first ever women&#x27;s champion in the triple jump.

== Ban and suspension ==
Twice Kravets was caught breaking international rules regarding performance-enhancing substances. In 1993, Kravets was banned three months for use of stimulants. Then Kravets was suspended for two years in July 2000 after testing positive for a performance-enhancing steroid.

<text>William Augustus Banks III (born March 11, 1956) is an American athlete. Born at Travis Air Force Base, California, he grew up in San Diego County and went to Oceanside High School. Banks is an Eagle Scout.

==Track and Field==
Banks was a track &amp; field athlete competing in the triple jump. On June 16, 1985 he set a world record of 17.97 m (58 feet 11.5 inches) at the national championships in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. He finished second in the NCAA Championships in 1977 and 1978. He earned his B.A. and Juris Doctor (J.D.) from UCLA. He broke the American triple jump record in 1981. He qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but did not compete due to the U.S. Olympic Committee&#x27;s boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. He was one of 461 athletes to receive a Congressional Gold Medal instead. Banks was a member of the 1984 and 1988 Olympic teams and participated with the 1983 and 1987 IAAF World Championships in Athletics World Championship teams. He was awarded the &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; and United States Olympic Committee Athlete of the Year in 1985 and won the Jesse Owens Award as the Outstanding Athlete in Track and Field.

He served USA Track &amp; Field as chair of the Athletes Advisory Committee in addition to serving as an organization vice president.

Banks will always be remembered as one of the most flamboyant athletes to compete in track and field. He is the originator of the now common hand clapping that takes place during many track and field events, and which he first did at DN-galan in 1981.

Banks exuberant personality was also present in his jumping. He has been reported as laughing during some of his jumps. When he set the world record of 17.97 m at the 1985 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, his attention seemed more intent on completing his jump in order to cheer for teammate Louise Romo who was completing her 800 metres on the track adjacent to the runway at the same time. He held that record for over ten years until Jonathan Edwards broke it for the first time in 1995 with 17.98m. He also jumped 18.20m at Indianapolis in 1988, but this was assisted by an over the limit wind reading of 5.2 m/s. Held Masters Triple Jump (M45 &amp; M60) and Masters High Jump (M55 &amp; M60) Records.

==Hall of Fame==
Banks was inducted into the USA National Track &amp; Field Hall of Fame in 1999 and was still competing at an advanced age. In 2006, he cleared an impressive 14.00 m to head the 2006 World Masters rankings in the 50–54 age group, just 7 cm behind that age-group&#x27;s world record. He won the 2007 World Masters Athletics Championships in that same age group. On September 22, 2012, Banks became the oldest American to clear 6 feet in the high jump at the age of 56 using just a 3-step approach and the classic &quot;roll&quot; technique. For that performance, Banks was named the USATF Athlete of the Week.

==US Olympians Association==
Banks was President of the US Olympians Association from 2005 to 2008. In 2008 he joined the newly reconstituted USATF Board of Directors. Banks was on a panel on an ESPN &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; episode regarding athlete involvement in social issues, dated May 18, 2008.

==ANOC 2019 World Beach Games==
Banks serves as the President &amp; Chief Executive Officer of the Local Organizing Committee of ANOC 2019 World Beach Games San Diego 2019, the inaugural World Beach Games.

==Rankings==

Banks was ranked among the best in the US and the world over the incredible spread of 18 seasons from 1975 to 1992, including twice world number 1 in 1981 and 1985, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.
